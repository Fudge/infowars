[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  A killer hurricane is on the move. Hurricane Gustav, after leaving 71 dead in the Caribbean,
[00:06.240 --> 00:11.440]  is expected to cross over Cuba today after plowing through the Cayman Islands. As Hurricane
[00:11.440 --> 00:16.720]  Gustav nears, many in New Orleans aren't waiting around to be told to leave. Correspondent Warren
[00:16.720 --> 00:21.440]  Levinson is in New Orleans, where memories of Katrina are still vivid. The buses are coming,
[00:21.440 --> 00:25.360]  starting Saturday for New Orleans residents who don't have their own transportation out of the
[00:25.360 --> 00:30.880]  city. Emergency preparedness director Jerry Snead figures they'll move 30,000 of the city's 310
[00:30.880 --> 00:36.400]  to 340,000 residents. We don't want anybody left here except the first responders. It could
[00:36.400 --> 00:41.440]  strengthen to a category three storm and hit the US Gulf Coast early next week. A full-scale
[00:41.440 --> 00:46.480]  evacuation of New Orleans could come as early as Sunday. Warren Levinson, New Orleans. You're
[00:46.480 --> 00:56.080]  listening to IRN USA Radio News. Suriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful,
[00:56.080 --> 01:00.640]  but the emotional suffering can be even more devastating. My body was so sore, my mind was
[01:00.640 --> 01:04.880]  so worn out, I could not sleep at night. I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaking
[01:04.880 --> 01:08.400]  is. And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty. A lot of people know when I have
[01:08.400 --> 01:12.800]  this embarrassing. Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at. The solution is

[01:55.520 --> 02:00.240]  term Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate. Correspondent at
[02:00.240 --> 02:05.760]  Donahue has a report. John McCain says Sarah Palin's experience in shaking up the status quo
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.720]  is exactly what is needed in Washington today. She's not from these parts and she's not from
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.560]  Washington but when you get to know her you're gonna be as impressed as I am. Palin says she is
[02:16.560 --> 02:22.400]  ready for the challenge. I know that it will demand the best that I have to give and I promise
[02:22.400 --> 02:27.200]  nothing less. A spokeswoman with the Obama campaign says John McCain put the former mayor of a town
[02:27.200 --> 02:33.120]  of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency. McCain and
[02:33.120 --> 02:38.560]  Palin are on a bus tour across Ohio to Pittsburgh where they will hold a campaign rally today.
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.240]  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton plan to speak at a memorial today for the late Ohio Congresswoman
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.720]  Stephanie Tabs Jones the 58-year-old died earlier this month from a brain hemorrhage.

[03:22.880 --> 03:28.080]  A train slammed into a propane tanker truck in north central Oklahoma triggered an explosion
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.640]  killing two people and injuring a third. A series of fast moving thunderstorms packing
[03:32.640 --> 03:38.080]  winds up to 100 miles per hour has plowed through the Phoenix area. Tens of thousands were without
[03:38.080 --> 03:44.320]  power. Several airliners were damaged. ASU's new football facility was also damaged. More headaches
[03:44.320 --> 03:49.200]  ahead if you plan on taking an airline for transportation US airline executives say that
[03:49.200 --> 03:54.640]  despite the economic downturn fares will rise. Discounts currently available will be scarce
[03:54.640 --> 03:59.520]  and routes and frequencies of lights will be reduced as domestic capacity is cut through the
[03:59.520 --> 04:05.200]  end of the year. Retail gas prices up slightly for the first time in six weeks. An analyst sworn
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.760]  that if Hurricane Gustaf makes a direct hit on US oil rig refineries or the distribution system
[04:11.760 --> 04:16.800]  the price could soar to near five bucks a gallon. In Orange County, Florida the mother of a missing
[04:16.800 --> 04:23.280]  Florida girl has been arrested again this time on check fraud and theft charges. Casey Anthony's
[04:23.280 --> 04:28.560]  latest arrest came just over a week after a bounty hunter bailed her out of jail. She's now being
[04:28.560 --> 04:34.480]  held on $3,000 bonds. Stocks closed sharply on Wall Street following a government report the
[04:34.480 --> 04:39.840]  personal income fell last month by the largest amount in nearly three years. The vow lost about
[04:39.840 --> 04:48.720]  171 points. The NASDAQ dropped 1.8% on the day and the S&P 500 fell 17.85. I'm Pete LaValle,

[06:32.320 --> 06:36.320]  Welcome my friends. Welcome and thank you for joining us for this Sunday edition. I'm live on
[06:36.320 --> 06:42.240]  the radio six days a week and Monday and Friday is not enough. I come in every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[06:42.240 --> 06:50.000]  Central Standard Time. That's 5 to 7 Eastern. We'll be here for the next two hours. Former
[06:50.000 --> 06:58.480]  White House analyst and White House historian. Also top consultant to NASA writer for the Washington
[06:58.480 --> 07:06.400]  Post and many other major publications. We'll be joining us in about 25 minutes. Richard C. Cook to
[07:06.400 --> 07:13.200]  discuss the latest developments between the burgeoning hot war, not cold war, with Russia,
[07:13.200 --> 07:19.520]  NATO and the United States. The Shanghai cooperative agreement being activated between China and Russia.
[07:19.520 --> 07:28.640]  I ran in Russia teaming of very, very serious developments happening there. We'll also
[07:28.640 --> 07:36.960]  break down what's happening with Hurricane Gustav set to slam into the Gulf Coast sometime tomorrow,
[07:37.520 --> 07:42.720]  landing on the Republican National Convention Parade, dwarfing that in fact McCain and many
[07:42.720 --> 07:49.040]  others aren't planning to be there now, but to go down and grandstand next to Obama and Obama
[07:49.040 --> 07:56.320]  next to him for the spotlight after the botched hurricane Katrina situation. So for all intents
[07:56.320 --> 08:03.360]  and purposes they're reporting right now that the RNC, well Politico saying they're scrambling
[08:03.360 --> 08:08.720]  and that it's in shambles and that it basically isn't even going to be happening. So we'll see
[08:08.720 --> 08:12.960]  if they are right about that, but frankly that doesn't even matter when we start talking about
[08:12.960 --> 08:20.880]  issues with a new cold war slash hot war with Russia. Meanwhile, ridiculous comments out of
[08:20.880 --> 08:26.320]  Michael Moore saying hurricane coming during GOP convention proof there is a God in heaven.
[08:26.320 --> 08:30.720]  I'm not even bashing Michael Moore here. I'm not weighing in. Both of these conventions are
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.720]  nothing but theater to give the public the illusion that these presidential contenders
[08:34.720 --> 08:40.560]  actually run something. I went to the DNC to document the police state, to document the
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.800]  anarchists, would they be out there provocaturing and I spent as you know five days there reporting
[08:46.800 --> 08:52.160]  and we made the news repeatedly. In fact, in hundreds of newspapers, national television,
[08:52.160 --> 08:56.880]  international news, that was our goal was to go into that staged event, that theater,
[08:56.880 --> 09:01.440]  pull down the curtain and show people that it was nothing but a Shakespearean diversion from
[09:01.440 --> 09:10.640]  the real governors of our planet, i.e., the New World Order. Interesting tidbit on the subject
[09:10.640 --> 09:18.640]  of Hurricane Gustav set to make landfall in Louisiana right now, same place that Katrina hit.
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.560]  Gustav evacuees get barcoded bracelets, the Tyler paper of Tyler, Texas reporting.
[09:24.560 --> 09:28.720]  Tyler will be a hub for several thousand hurricane Gustav evacuees and city officials
[09:28.720 --> 09:33.120]  enacted its emergency response plan and so far it seems as though early relief efforts have been
[09:33.120 --> 09:40.000]  fluid and it says everyone has to wear little RFID barcode bracelets. Now that's because under
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.160]  this FEMA is enacting continuity of government and these individuals for all intents and purposes
[09:44.160 --> 09:53.200]  are prisoners, so we'll be going over that for you. But I first want to get into the situation
[09:53.200 --> 10:02.320]  with Russia. For those that don't know, the former Soviet Union very corrupt, extremely evil,
[10:02.320 --> 10:11.280]  conservatively killed 60 million of its own people. And in 1991, because their own police,
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.840]  their own military wouldn't go along with it anymore, starting in Poland and then of course
[10:15.840 --> 10:22.800]  with the Stasi in East Germany, with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 89, that led up to Boris
[10:22.800 --> 10:28.160]  Yeltsin's seizing control of the capital and then basically collapsing into an alcoholic stupor
[10:28.160 --> 10:35.280]  until 1999 when the true head of the country, former KGB chief from St. Petersburg, Vladimir
[10:35.280 --> 10:42.880]  Putin, took over under suspicious circumstances with a popular war. The US-backed Chechens were
[10:42.880 --> 10:48.080]  beating Russian forces. He couldn't get the Russian people behind an invasion of Chechnya to
[10:48.080 --> 10:55.360]  save the breakaway republic. And so the evidence is clear, Vladimir Putin's FSB, the name of the
[10:55.360 --> 11:02.480]  new KGB, staged terror attacks by blowing up three apartment buildings. Moscow police caught
[11:02.480 --> 11:09.120]  FSB members planting, that's government, that's KGB's new name at the time, Federal Security
[11:09.120 --> 11:16.720]  Bureau planting hexagons bombs, plastic explosives in a fourth building. So I'm not here seeing
[11:16.720 --> 11:22.400]  Vladimir Putin as a wonderful person. I'm not here seeing Vladimir Putin as an angel or his new
[11:22.400 --> 11:31.040]  puppet president that he has in there, though he's very popular. He of course now is prime minister.
[11:31.040 --> 11:37.280]  I just report the facts here. Russia has been imploding. NATO and the West have been hiring
[11:37.280 --> 11:45.920]  Muslim extremists, as they always do, to attack different areas, different sectors of what has
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.240]  formerly been Russia territory. And when they take Chechnya, it's not enough, then they want to try
[11:50.240 --> 11:57.440]  to push into other areas, though Russia gained control back over Chechnya. Then in 1998, the
[11:58.240 --> 12:06.080]  KLA, or Kosovo Liberation Army, which are, if you can get this straight, Marxist-Leninist Muslims
[12:06.800 --> 12:15.120]  out of Albania, publicly US-backed with over $500 million, began attacking Serb military forces
[12:15.120 --> 12:22.800]  in Kosovo. And Kosovo's as much a part of Serbia as Texas, Oklahoma, you know, Tennessee are.
[12:23.760 --> 12:29.600]  And the KLA launched long-term multi-year attacks, killing men, women, and children,
[12:29.600 --> 12:35.680]  running sneak attacks on police stations, you name it. And the Slovak Milojevic finally
[12:35.680 --> 12:40.160]  launched an attack down into Kosovo, clearing them out. The world's screen-bloody murder,
[12:40.160 --> 12:48.400]  NATO went in and bombarded not just Kosovo, but all of Serbia bombing Belgrade with depleted
[12:48.400 --> 12:53.040]  uranium weapons, radiating the population, their cancer levels have now more than tripled,
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.640]  international studies show, bombing the infrastructure of the nation, their car
[12:58.640 --> 13:04.000]  plants, their helicopter plants, their airplane plants, their water treatment plants, their media,
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.960]  their universities, their electrical power generation facilities, because they don't
[13:08.960 --> 13:14.080]  want a sovereign nation right in the middle of the new world order. The globalists don't
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.200]  want any sovereign nations, not US, not Russia, not Iran, not anybody. The US is dominated by
[13:19.200 --> 13:26.000]  the international banking cartel, Serbia was not. And so they use Muslims to attack them,
[13:27.440 --> 13:33.600]  but it's just like 1984. East Asia has never been our enemy. The next day,
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.440]  East Asia has always been our enemy, or Eurasia has never been our enemy. Now it's always been
[13:37.440 --> 13:44.960]  our enemy. They told the American people that Serbia attacked Kosovo, and the public bought it,
[13:44.960 --> 13:51.200]  and CNN and others got caught showing UN camps on the Macedonian border and the Albanian border
[13:51.840 --> 13:58.080]  with starving people months into this, trying to break into the camps regarding the food,
[13:58.080 --> 14:01.280]  and they lied and showed people through the barbed wire looking in and said,
[14:01.280 --> 14:05.520]  look, they're in Serb camps. And that's now admitted. The American people bought it.
[14:05.520 --> 14:11.360]  Slobodan Milošević was grabbed and then poisoned to death years later in the Hague,
[14:11.360 --> 14:14.960]  and it was admitted he was poisoned. He said they threatened to poison me if I don't believe guilty,
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.520]  then they poisoned him, and they said, well, he got poisoned in his cell and poisoned his
[14:19.520 --> 14:30.480]  self. Now that's a fact. Now, expanding, the same thing just happened. On 888,
[14:30.480 --> 14:35.360]  the day the Olympics started, this is all in the European press, even in the bottom of the
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.760]  newspapers here in the U.S., but you've got to dig to find it, 1,000 Israeli commandos,
[14:39.760 --> 14:45.120]  that's in a rot-strizzling post. They're very proud of it. More than 1,000 Ukrainian commandos,
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.960]  hundreds, and this is the admitted number, of U.S. Marines and Army commandos,
[14:50.320 --> 14:55.200]  launched a sneak attack on the capital of South Ossetia that's always been part of Russia.
[14:56.240 --> 15:02.560]  Always been part of Russia. Georgia, for more than 200 years, has been, and Joe Stalin was
[15:02.560 --> 15:09.840]  from there, so he made it part of Russia. Well, that is, took some enclaves that have been part of
[15:09.840 --> 15:15.280]  Russia of Ossetia and Abkhazia, and gave it to Georgia and the governor there that he was friends
[15:15.280 --> 15:22.880]  with. And in 1991, the Georgians launched sneak attacks on those Russian enclaves. The UN came
[15:22.880 --> 15:30.240]  in, and then on 888, U.S.-backed Georgians launched a massive sneak attack, killing thousands.
[15:30.240 --> 15:35.440]  Now, having the most dumbed-down public in the world, our media told us, had line Russia sneak
[15:35.440 --> 15:40.160]  attacks Georgia. When we come back, I'm going to give you the latest developments. It's getting
[15:40.160 --> 15:45.280]  very, very serious, and we've got two experts joining us. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and Richard
[15:45.280 --> 15:56.880]  C. Cook, stay with us. Did you know that it's a documented fact? 80 percent of all Americans
[15:56.880 --> 16:02.000]  and 85 percent of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.120]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases
[16:07.120 --> 16:11.520]  from these parasites, and your doctor would never know it. In fact, clinically-detected
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.400]  parasites account for only 1 percent of all cases. Don't continue to suffer from pain due
[16:16.400 --> 16:21.040]  to misdiagnosis. Now, you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high
[16:21.040 --> 16:26.960]  cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP,

[16:55.520 --> 17:00.560]  Note and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as
[17:00.560 --> 17:05.200]  no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.760]  from their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.400]  held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the
[17:14.400 --> 17:19.120]  government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy. A
[17:19.120 --> 17:23.840]  current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for
[17:23.840 --> 17:28.960]  depositors. However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.760]  inflation. In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.200]  of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver. While paper investments currently
[17:39.200 --> 17:45.040]  have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information,
[17:45.040 --> 17:56.000]  call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237. Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[17:56.000 --> 18:01.520]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street. In Minnesota, you can be fine
[18:01.520 --> 18:06.480]  for displaying that your vehicle is for sale. These laws are obviously not made to protect us,
[18:06.480 --> 18:11.520]  but instead to help states profit. The use of red light cameras is another great example. They
[18:11.520 --> 18:18.240]  intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money. Sprayyourplate.com

[18:54.640 --> 18:59.760]  most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health? Most experts agree that the
[18:59.760 --> 19:06.240]  water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher. Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula
[19:06.240 --> 19:11.200]  of the most alkaline minerals and elements. This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength
[19:11.200 --> 19:17.200]  and effectiveness. Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline

[19:51.280 --> 20:00.400]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[20:06.160 --> 20:10.000]  All right. We're back live, my friends. Thank you for joining us continuing. I gave you some of
[20:10.000 --> 20:21.840]  the basic history of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and then the quote West encircling
[20:21.840 --> 20:31.040]  them. At the time in 1999, U.S. troops began moving along with NATO troops, British troops,
[20:32.000 --> 20:38.800]  into Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, that state capital in Serbia, and the Russians
[20:38.800 --> 20:44.640]  flew in with aircraft and took over the main airport. General Wesley Clark at the time gave
[20:44.640 --> 20:53.200]  the order for NATO aircraft to bomb the Russian tanks that had been invited in by Serbia because
[20:53.200 --> 21:00.000]  NATO was trying to take that part of Serbia, and Russia went ahead and backed off, pulled out under
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.280]  the promise there would not be ethnic cleansing and that Kosovo or one-third of Serbia would not
[21:05.280 --> 21:10.800]  be handed over to the Muslims, going back to the Crusades and the fights back and forth between
[21:10.800 --> 21:16.240]  the Muslims and the Christians over that area. It's holy land to people there in Eastern Europe
[21:16.240 --> 21:22.560]  and always been part of Serbia. And then last year, the United States announced, yep, we are
[21:22.560 --> 21:27.840]  breaking that off completely, and we are giving it basically to Albania, Muslim Albania.
[21:29.440 --> 21:32.960]  This is the same government telling you, give up all your rights or the evil Muslims are going
[21:32.960 --> 21:40.240]  to get you. No, they use whoever they can whenever. Ideology means nothing, only pulling down sovereignty
[21:40.240 --> 21:44.160]  and independent states that have their own banking systems. This is a global government
[21:44.160 --> 21:49.840]  being formed. Now, the Russians are watching this happen. Meanwhile, thousands of U.S. troops,
[21:49.840 --> 21:56.160]  weapons systems, black sites, ghost sites, that is secret U.S. military bases, open military
[21:56.160 --> 22:03.680]  bases being set up in Czech Republic, in Ukraine, in Georgia, of course, in Poland,
[22:03.680 --> 22:09.840]  moving offensive and defensive weapons systems in. NATO then last year put out a new policy.
[22:09.840 --> 22:14.880]  It's incredible saying we may launch a sneak attack, a preemptive nuclear war on Russia.
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.680]  Russia is like, why are you doing that? So Russia starts testing hypersonic missiles,
[22:19.680 --> 22:26.160]  long range ICBMs with MIRV tips, multiple reentry devices, so one missile can carry in 24 warheads
[22:26.160 --> 22:29.600]  when it comes back into the atmosphere over North America, when it's shot over the polar
[22:29.600 --> 22:38.640]  ice cap to the north of the Arctic. Escalating all this, and then on 888, on 888, a sneak attack
[22:38.640 --> 22:44.240]  is launched on Russian bases that were internationally sanctioned in there since 1991,
[22:44.240 --> 22:49.840]  killing thousands, in fact, Georgian peacekeepers inside the bases would wait till the Russians would
[22:49.840 --> 22:55.760]  run out of their bunkers when they were getting bombed and would machine gun them. These are
[22:55.760 --> 22:59.520]  Georgian peacekeepers, part of the U.N. force that were in there with the Russians, guys they
[22:59.520 --> 23:04.560]  were eating with hours before, guys they were bunking next to hours. I mean, this is the most
[23:04.560 --> 23:10.720]  dastardly sneak attack you can imagine. Pearl Harbor was bad enough with zeroes flying over
[23:10.720 --> 23:15.760]  bombing ships. This is guys you've been bunking next to. Talk about a dastardly sneak attack.
[23:16.960 --> 23:21.600]  So all of this is going on, and they think the American public is so stupid.
[23:24.080 --> 23:27.920]  And I even bought it for about 10 minutes that Friday on the air. I was like, my god,
[23:27.920 --> 23:32.640]  look at the headlines. It says Russia has attacked Georgia, and then I would read in the bottom of
[23:32.640 --> 23:40.320]  it and say, wait a minute, after Georgia attacked these Russian enclaves. So, I mean, even I don't
[23:40.320 --> 23:51.440]  expect the government and the media to lie in that extreme of a way. And now for the last month,
[23:52.160 --> 23:59.200]  close to a month, they have been saying the same thing over and over and over again.
[23:59.200 --> 24:04.560]  Russia is bad. Russia has to have sanctions put on it. More US troops have to be brought up to
[24:04.560 --> 24:13.280]  their borders, more missile systems. And meanwhile, the EU, European Union is set to vote tomorrow on
[24:13.280 --> 24:19.520]  sanctions on Russia. The Black Sea Fleet is being threatened by the Ukrainian fleet, saying they
[24:19.520 --> 24:27.120]  can't land back at their port that they've leased. It goes on and on and on. And US forces, I've got
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.760]  the articles right here, are massing. US troops are being flown in by the thousands, weapons systems.
[24:31.760 --> 24:37.840]  Russia is saying that's an act of war. The United States is saying leave Abkhazia and Ossetia,
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.800]  which have always been part of Russia and which were just snuck attack. And I hear the public and
[24:42.800 --> 24:47.120]  I hear talk show hosts saying, man, Russia is bad at sneak attacking Georgia. Just like they say,
[24:47.120 --> 24:52.960]  man, the Serbs are bad at sneak attacking Albania. When the main line history admits it's the opposite.
[24:52.960 --> 25:00.960]  So Russia is saying they stand by their actions of recognizing completely Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[25:00.960 --> 25:07.360]  Russian President Dmitry Medved has said his decision to recognize Georgia's breakaway regions as
[25:07.360 --> 25:12.880]  independent is irrevocable. On the eve of the special EU summit on Georgia, he warned that Russia
[25:12.880 --> 25:19.520]  has ready to retaliate against any sanctions that you might impose. And folks, when they impose these
[25:19.520 --> 25:25.040]  and Russia cuts off oil and gas to Europe, it'll be, oh, look how mean Russia is. Germany and the UK
[25:25.040 --> 25:29.520]  have differed in tone over how the EU should proceed with Berlin warning against escalation.
[25:29.520 --> 25:35.520]  Moscow's envoy to London and sanctions would hurt the EU more than Russia. And it goes on and on.
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.000]  But right now, let me play you about a minute and a half, two minutes of Vladimir Putin speaking to
[25:40.000 --> 25:47.200]  the international media. Let's go ahead and roll that down. At this time, I was in Beijing and had
[25:47.200 --> 25:52.240]  an opportunity to have a brief discussion with the President of the United States. George told me
[25:52.240 --> 25:57.280]  that no one wants a war. I hope that the US administration would intervene to stop the
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.200]  aggression of the Georgian leadership. But nothing of this kind happened.
[26:03.200 --> 26:08.160]  You've always enjoyed, over your period as President of Russia, and still now, a very close
[26:08.160 --> 26:14.160]  personal relationship with the US President George W. Bush. Do you think that his failure to
[26:14.160 --> 26:19.120]  restrain the Georgian forces on this occasion has damaged that relationship?
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.880]  Of course it has damaged our relations, first and foremost, interstate relations.
[26:27.440 --> 26:31.840]  But the thing is not only that the US administration has failed to restrain leadership
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.480]  from committing this criminal act, but in fact equipped and trained the Georgian army.
[26:37.280 --> 26:42.720]  But I have some other comment to add. Even during the Cold War, during the time of tough
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.920]  confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States, we have always avoided direct
[26:47.920 --> 26:54.320]  clashes between our civilians, let alone our servicemen. We have serious reasons to believe
[26:54.320 --> 27:00.000]  that directly in the combat zone, citizens of the United States were present. And if this is
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.440]  the case, then the suspicion arises that someone in the United States has on purpose created
[27:05.440 --> 27:11.040]  this conflict with a view to exacerbate the situation and create a competitive advantage
[27:11.040 --> 27:13.680]  for one of the presidential candidates in the United States.
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.360]  These are quite astounding claims. Just to be clear, Mr. Prime Minister, are you suggesting
[27:21.360 --> 27:26.400]  that there were US operatives on the ground assisting Georgian forces, perhaps even provoking
[27:26.400 --> 27:31.680]  a conflict, in order to give a presidential candidate in the United States some kind of
[27:31.680 --> 27:47.600]  talking point? I've told you that if the facts are confirmed that US citizens were present
[27:47.600 --> 27:52.880]  in the combat zone, that it means only one thing, that they could be there only on the
[27:52.880 --> 27:57.680]  direct instruction of their leadership. And if this is so, then it means that American
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.960]  citizens are in the combat zone, performing their duties, and they can only do that following
[28:02.960 --> 28:08.320]  a direct order from their leaders and not on their own initiative. Ordinary experts,
[28:08.320 --> 28:14.240]  even if they are providing training in military matters, should do that. Not in a combat zone,
[28:14.240 --> 28:20.000]  but out of training ranges and training centers. I repeat, this needs to be further checked out.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.480]  I'm telling you this based on what our military told me.
[28:22.480 --> 28:27.920]  All right, we're going to come back after the news. Stay with us more as this develops. I haven't
[28:27.920 --> 28:31.840]  even scratched the surface of the important information that we're going to be covering.
[28:31.840 --> 28:41.520]  It's all posted on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now. They have completely encircled Russia.
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.480]  NATO has announced they may preemptively strike Russia with nuclear weapons. We've never seen
[28:46.480 --> 28:54.240]  an escalation like this in the history with Russia. We'll be back. Honey, have you seen the remote?
[28:54.240 --> 28:58.240]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys? I can't find my wallet.

[32:03.120 --> 32:08.720]  was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S. Though the people of the U.S. where
[32:08.720 --> 32:13.200]  their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the men and
[32:13.200 --> 32:18.160]  bringing them to justice. All nations will participate since they reside the world over.

[32:34.000 --> 32:39.040]  the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind. We will undo through

[33:02.400 --> 33:07.680]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm. He's Alex Jones.
[33:12.800 --> 33:18.000]  Russia has criticized the western media for what it's called its biased view on the conflict.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.320]  But not all journalists blame Russia for the conflict, but we're now joined on the line by
[33:22.320 --> 33:28.240]  Alex Jones, the U.S. investigative journalist from theinfo-walls.com website. To get his opinion
[33:28.240 --> 33:32.400]  on this, hello to you, Mr. Jones. So, in your opinion, what was wrong with the coverage of
[33:32.400 --> 33:38.080]  this conflict in western media? Well, Ellis, thank you for having me on. First off, let me say I am
[33:38.080 --> 33:44.480]  ashamed as an American. I'm a loyal American who loves my country, but my country has been taken
[33:44.480 --> 33:50.880]  over by a private international military-industrial complex, and they launched a sneak attack on
[33:50.880 --> 33:58.000]  the Russian enclaves of Abkhazia in other areas, as you know, on 888, using the cover of the Olympic
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.840]  Games and a dastardly sneak attack on the order of Pearl Harbor. All right, folks. I'm going to
[34:03.840 --> 34:08.720]  play that full six-minute interview on Russia today. That's their biggest domestic channel,
[34:08.720 --> 34:12.320]  their biggest international. It's standard, like Paul Watson, one of our webmasters,
[34:12.320 --> 34:17.040]  lives in London, and that's on his standard cable package. In fact, it's on cable right
[34:17.040 --> 34:22.720]  here in the United States, tens of millions of viewers in any one time. And in six minutes,
[34:22.720 --> 34:29.040]  I broke down on Russian television exactly what's happening. And in the next hour, before Dr.
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.280]  Paul Gregg Roberts joins us in the last 30 minutes of the show, former head of the Treasury
[34:33.280 --> 34:38.320]  Department, father of Reaganomics, former Wall Street Journal editor, breaking down the treason
[34:38.320 --> 34:44.560]  of the New World Order neocons using our country for this. I'm going to play that and analyze it
[34:44.560 --> 34:48.960]  and break down. You know, some would say, well, why go on Russian TV and speak out against what's
[34:48.960 --> 34:54.400]  happening? You have to do that. You have to save some of America's name. We're now known as the
[34:54.400 --> 35:00.400]  country of torture, the country of secret arrest, the country that stages terror attacks, the very
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.800]  people that run our nation that control both parties are the ones getting rid of our borders,
[35:04.800 --> 35:09.760]  destroying our currency, destroying our country's name. And
[35:12.800 --> 35:18.960]  they are now launching sneak attacks on Russian enclaves and handing part of Serbia over to
[35:18.960 --> 35:23.600]  Muslim countries while telling us to hide under our beds and give up all of our liberties of the
[35:23.600 --> 35:30.480]  evil Muslims. We'll get us on and on and on and on is the propaganda, the evil Muslim, the evil
[35:30.480 --> 35:35.920]  Muslim. But it's not the evil Muslim when it's their Muslims and I'm not saying Muslims are
[35:35.920 --> 35:42.320]  evil. I'm quoting them that are staging these terror attacks that are attacking nations.
[35:42.320 --> 35:47.680]  And then every time the nation tries to defend itself, NATO, the United States comes in and
[35:47.680 --> 35:54.320]  bombs the living daylights out of them and then has such contempt for the American people tells
[35:54.320 --> 36:01.680]  us that Russia started all of this and now NATO and the EU are talking about sanctions on Russia.
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.120]  Russia is saying it's an act of war for more U.S. troops to be massing in Georgia
[36:07.120 --> 36:14.400]  and surrounding countries. Pressure is mounting on the EU to isolate Russia. Putin saying U.S.
[36:14.400 --> 36:19.760]  provoked Georgian conflict and saying that the U.S. did this for gain but not the U.S.,
[36:19.760 --> 36:25.680]  the multinational corporations that use us as their engine, as their engine of domination and
[36:25.680 --> 36:29.920]  control. And the whole world is going into receivership, being bankrupted, being consolidated.
[36:29.920 --> 36:36.080]  I have the New York Times here today dealing with the fact that they're not just going to hand over
[36:36.080 --> 36:44.560]  city streets to private corporations but city government operations. This is part of the IMF
[36:44.560 --> 36:51.600]  World Bank plan that we've been reporting on since 2002 when thousands of pages of IMF and World
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.520]  Bank documents got leaked and they talked about how they go in, how they buy off governments,
[36:55.520 --> 37:00.000]  how they then bankrupt societies, create currency implosions so they can come in the
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  multinationals and buy the country up cheap and how they wanted to do it to Western Europe,
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.760]  the United States, and of course England. And they're doing that now. We're now six years later
[37:09.760 --> 37:13.680]  and they're engineering all this but they need you to rally around the flag and blame it all
[37:13.680 --> 37:18.800]  on a foreign enemy. They need that false patriotism, that false nationalism, so they go up and they
[37:18.800 --> 37:25.360]  punch the Russian bear right in the nose and then it starts, you know, taking swipes at the
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.840]  bee that just stung it on the end of its nose and our media has such contempt for us
[37:29.840 --> 37:34.640]  that they tell us that Russia started it all. Absolutely amazing. It is because I love this
[37:34.640 --> 37:39.920]  country that I'm speaking out against this because it's my right and my duty to not allow my country
[37:39.920 --> 37:45.200]  to be hijacked by multinational corporations and used to start wars and they need this. You know,
[37:45.200 --> 37:50.080]  their war on terror, their hoax is falling apart. The people are awakening to that so
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.480]  they're trying to go back to their old cold war but this time they're starting a hot war with
[37:54.480 --> 37:59.840]  Russia and so because I love this country I have to speak out against it being taken into criminal
[37:59.840 --> 38:05.120]  wars. You know, you may want to believe the media about WMDs and Iraq and their lies there
[38:05.120 --> 38:09.760]  but you can't believe them that Russia started this. You know, it's time to wake up and realize our
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.720]  government's been hijacked and they use phony patriotism to manipulate us. I want to go to
[38:14.720 --> 38:19.760]  Richard C. Cook. He's written for The Washington Post and scores of other top publications. He's
[38:19.760 --> 38:24.640]  a historian. I've been an analyst at the White House to NASA. His bio goes on and on and on.
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.840]  You can check out his website. We'll give that to you but he's with us for the rest of the hour.
[38:27.840 --> 38:32.400]  I know we have calls. We'll take those in the next half of the next hour. Then we've got, again,
[38:32.400 --> 38:37.920]  former head of policy, Department of Treasury, former Wall Street Journal editor Dr. Paul Craig
[38:37.920 --> 38:43.040]  Roberts joining us to also talk about the Russia situation. Thank you for coming on, Mr. Cook.
[38:43.040 --> 38:47.760]  Thank you, Alex. I'm glad to be here. You haven't been on this show and it's on some stations
[38:47.760 --> 38:52.800]  that the weekday show isn't. Why don't you just in a nutshell tell us about your particular
[38:54.240 --> 38:57.760]  acumen, you know, how you've come to your understanding of what's happening right now
[38:57.760 --> 39:01.200]  in Russia. You've written about all this happening before it happened and then break down very
[39:01.200 --> 39:07.360]  simply what we're facing and cover the latest mega escalations, which I can't even find words to
[39:07.360 --> 39:16.800]  describe. Well, you take a long range view and the western powers have been under the control of
[39:16.800 --> 39:25.280]  an international financial elite going back probably at least a century. What we're seeing now
[39:25.280 --> 39:31.200]  happening with Russia is simply the latest phase in what I call the Second Hundred Years War. The
[39:31.200 --> 39:35.760]  First Hundred Years War, of course, took place back in the Middle Ages, the late Middle Ages,
[39:35.760 --> 39:41.280]  between England and France. And now we've seen the Second Hundred Years War where the international
[39:41.280 --> 39:47.280]  financial elite that wants to control everything has been pitting one nation against another.
[39:47.280 --> 39:54.080]  And the way it works is they make their money by lending to governments, by putting governments
[39:54.080 --> 40:00.160]  in receivership, putting governments into bankruptcy, forcing on nations, enormous income taxes,
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.960]  and enormous loans. And Serbia and Russia have been doing too good, so they have to
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.560]  have client states attack them. Well, Russia has been the enemy of the western powers
[40:11.360 --> 40:18.400]  for a very long time and it really goes back into religious history. And it's just the latest
[40:18.400 --> 40:26.640]  phase of these fomented inter-European wars, an inter-European civil war, which is all World War
[40:26.640 --> 40:33.040]  I and World War II really were. And now we're seeing it again. We're seeing the financiers who
[40:33.040 --> 40:39.040]  control the economies of the world pitting the United States and Russia against each other,
[40:39.040 --> 40:45.680]  once again, trying to foment these kinds of inter-western wars because they make a lot of
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.720]  money off of it. Absolutely. And we now have the handbooks and internal documents on this.
[40:50.720 --> 40:57.920]  This is not your opinion. That's right. That's correct. And as you say, it was the west who
[40:57.920 --> 41:04.080]  attacked Russia initially by going in and, of course, we had somebody from Chinese staff being in
[41:04.880 --> 41:11.280]  Georgia the week before the attack. They claim that the person was there to prepare for
[41:11.280 --> 41:15.760]  Chinese planned visit, which, of course, was nonsense because while that person was there,
[41:15.760 --> 41:23.200]  the plans were formulated for the Georgian military to make this incursion into South
[41:23.200 --> 41:30.080]  Assetia when civilians were attacked and civilians were killed. And now we have the counterattack
[41:30.080 --> 41:34.880]  by Russia, which made a fool, of course, of the Georgian army, the Georgian military.
[41:34.880 --> 41:40.560]  Did this go well? Did this go well? I'm going to let you finish. But the big question is,
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.920]  did this go well? Did this go how the Western powers, how the neocons, how the British
[41:45.920 --> 41:51.040]  Anglo-American establishment thought it would? No, I think what they were banking on was a long
[41:51.040 --> 41:58.560]  protracted stalemate taking place in the Caucasus. But Russia came in, they have probably the best
[41:58.560 --> 42:04.320]  ground force in the world, and they've had that at least since World War II and probably long
[42:04.320 --> 42:09.200]  before. So they thought it'd be a replay of 99 with the handover of Kosovo, but that didn't happen.
[42:09.200 --> 42:15.520]  And that didn't happen. It was over in a week. Now, probably the person who is most informed
[42:16.160 --> 42:21.680]  as to all this and why it happened was Putin. And Putin said something very interesting the other
[42:21.680 --> 42:29.440]  day. He was asked, why did you think the United States fomented this attack? And Putin said that
[42:29.440 --> 42:34.240]  it was in order to help get John McCain elected president. In fact, we played that before you
[42:34.240 --> 42:37.440]  came on, Mr. Cook. Stay there. That was pretty interesting, I thought. Yes, sir. Stay there.
[42:37.440 --> 42:41.840]  I'll let you go back and talk about the sneak attack itself, the spectacle of the American
[42:41.840 --> 42:46.400]  people like zombies walking around drooling, believing it, and where this is going, how you
[42:46.400 --> 42:51.200]  see this unfolding, how it ties into Iran. Richard C. Cook is our guest. We're very honored to have
[42:51.200 --> 42:58.000]  him stay with us. Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.040]  shortages already destroying millions of American families. Wheat for flour is already four times
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.240]  more expensive than it was about a year ago. Food costs continue to double because there's no food

[45:16.400 --> 45:22.160]  Let me tell you, I love it, love it, love it. I told both my sisters and niece about Curl Away

[45:26.560 --> 45:31.520]  is looking so healthy and fabulous I will not go back to a conventional relaxer. I just apply
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.000]  Curl Away like a relaxer and leave it on for up to nine hours and sometimes after washing I use
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.520]  a lull for extra shine and gloss. I'm really happy with Curl Away. It's a gentle gradual relaxer and
[45:41.520 --> 45:46.640]  won't create a miracle overnight but over time the miracle will happen. So go get your Curl Away

[47:02.480 --> 47:08.320]  The program, though, I like to surprise people. We're launching the new film I produced,
[47:08.320 --> 47:15.520]  which Jason Bermas directed, Fabled Enemies. Another 9-11 film, but this one covers the
[47:15.520 --> 47:20.880]  intelligence networks, who did it, how they did it, the shadow government, how it was activated
[47:20.880 --> 47:27.360]  that day. Watch all the trailers at infowars.com. In T-minus, one hour and 12 minutes from now.
[47:29.360 --> 47:35.280]  When this radio show ends, it goes live for PrisonPlanet.tv members and starting Tuesday,
[47:35.280 --> 47:40.080]  they start shipping out the DVDs to everybody that's pre-ordered them. But order the DVD,
[47:40.080 --> 47:43.520]  Fabled Enemies, with an hour and a half of extras. I don't have time to get into the film. It's
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.920]  excellent. It's very controversial in cutting edge, and it's controversial for me. So you can
[47:47.920 --> 47:53.680]  tell it's very controversial. Fabled Enemies and your PrisonPlanet.tv member 15 cents a day,
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.360]  $5.95 a month, get a yearly membership and get three months free, or just go get a trial
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.160]  one month membership for $5.95 right now at PrisonPlanet.tv because Fabled Enemies,
[48:02.160 --> 48:07.520]  the new film, premieres in T-minus, one hour, 11 minutes. Okay, I'm going to try to control myself.
[48:07.520 --> 48:11.200]  He just brings up so many points and so many facets. I want to raise so many questions.
[48:11.200 --> 48:14.560]  Let's do it this way, Mr. Cook. You're really an expert on this and predicted so much of what
[48:14.560 --> 48:19.360]  happened. We've seen big escalations the last few days. I could list them or you could. But whatever
[48:19.360 --> 48:24.880]  you think is most important about this conflict and where you see it going, to me, it signals
[48:24.880 --> 48:30.240]  desperation on the part of the Anglo-American establishment. And most of the even mainline
[48:30.240 --> 48:35.440]  analysts I see are saying they are really upset and concerned that this is worse than the Cuban
[48:35.440 --> 48:42.560]  Missile Crisis and that this is spiraling out of control very fast. Mr. Cook. In my opinion,
[48:42.560 --> 48:51.440]  a split at this point between the United States and the European elitists who have controlled
[48:51.440 --> 48:56.480]  events in the world for so long. And I think the United States is beginning to be viewed,
[48:56.480 --> 49:02.240]  and I'm talking here about the Bush administration, you know, the Bush Cheney Crime Syndicate or
[49:02.240 --> 49:12.720]  whatever you want to refer it as, because the United States plans to attack Iran have been
[49:12.720 --> 49:22.160]  checkmated as near as we can tell by the European powers. And that that is not going to happen,
[49:22.160 --> 49:27.680]  or at least it's not going to happen unless the U.S. and Israel just take on some kind of a rogue
[49:27.680 --> 49:33.920]  mission. But there will not be as far as we can tell a major attack on Iran. So what are they
[49:33.920 --> 49:40.160]  doing? Well, they're looking elsewhere because the United States has this overarching plan to
[49:40.160 --> 49:46.000]  control oil and natural gas in Central Asia. And that's what PNAC said in 2000. And that's what
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.560]  the PNAC said. Yeah. And the plan is failing. It's failing in Afghanistan. And that's why you
[49:52.560 --> 49:59.600]  have this really strange thing going on with Obama in Biden, where, you know, Obama began as an
[49:59.600 --> 50:05.600]  anti-war candidate saying, I'm the one who voted, you know, who didn't support the Iraq war. And
[50:05.600 --> 50:10.000]  now he's saying, well, the reason I didn't support the Iraq war was because we should have invaded
[50:10.000 --> 50:15.280]  Afghanistan. And now we're going to do that. And we're going to invade Afghanistan and Pakistan
[50:15.280 --> 50:20.160]  because that's where our real interest is. And that, of course, is just a sign of desperation.
[50:20.160 --> 50:28.400]  So we have the Iran situation falling out with the split with Europe. We have a failure in
[50:28.400 --> 50:34.640]  Afghanistan. We have Russia cementing its relations with China and the Central Asian
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.280]  Republic through the Shanghai Cooperative Organization, which is being tremendously
[50:39.280 --> 50:46.160]  strengthened by what the United States is doing. So it's almost as though this last ditch effort to
[50:46.960 --> 50:52.960]  do something in that part of the world because if you've got a military industrial intelligence
[50:52.960 --> 51:00.400]  complex that only lives off of conflict, that only has meaning when there's war, that only feels
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.360]  that it's doing what it's supposed to do in the world when it's attacking people, it's got to do
[51:05.360 --> 51:12.960]  something. You've got a huge military commitment and extension into Central Asia. After Vietnam,
[51:12.960 --> 51:18.480]  we thought, well, the U.S. has learned something. It'll never fight another Asian land war. And now
[51:18.480 --> 51:25.360]  we have the entire resources of America committed to a land war in Asia that nobody else wants.
[51:25.360 --> 51:32.640]  Why did they miscalculate, like Napoleon, like Hitler? Why have they miscalculated thinking that
[51:32.640 --> 51:39.600]  this U.S. slash NATO-backed sneak attack on Russia would result in the same type of thing
[51:40.400 --> 51:46.720]  that they saw in 1999? And then I tied that into Wesley Clark being overruled when he wanted to bomb
[51:46.720 --> 51:53.600]  Russian forces at the Pristina Airport. And then only General Jackson, the head of NATO, said no.
[51:53.600 --> 52:00.640]  He had a military force. I mean, again, we have this insane strain, it looks like, in both parties.
[52:00.640 --> 52:10.000]  Well, look at history. Napoleon invaded Russia. Hitler invaded Russia. Everyone who goes into
[52:10.000 --> 52:18.720]  that enormous expansive territory inhabited by these very highly intelligent and capable people
[52:19.360 --> 52:25.440]  end up getting their, you know, what gift, and now Bush has done it. Bush is the third dictator
[52:25.440 --> 52:31.600]  in history, in modern history. Let me back that up. People aren't going to believe you. And we're
[52:31.600 --> 52:35.920]  not for Al Gore. We're straightening to scientific, historical, sociological, anthropological facts.
[52:35.920 --> 52:39.680]  They stole the election, the Supreme Court appointed him, and he clearly stole it. People
[52:39.680 --> 52:45.040]  have gone to jail in Ohio. He clearly stole 2004. So when you say dictator, you mean it.
[52:45.040 --> 52:49.600]  And with the PDD-51, the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, Congress can't even see
[52:49.600 --> 52:56.080]  PDD-51, but the cover sheet says he's a dictator. Do you expect them, if they're brazen enough to
[52:56.080 --> 53:00.880]  launch 9-11 attacks, brazen enough to sneak attack? It comes out mainstream news that Cheney planned
[53:00.880 --> 53:05.280]  to sneak attack our own ships a few months ago in New Yorker Magazine. Do you see them
[53:05.280 --> 53:11.040]  trying to pull a rabbit out of a hat? Well, at this point, I don't know if they're capable of
[53:11.040 --> 53:16.160]  doing it because everybody's onto them. You know, there was talk a year ago, and I even wrote an
[53:16.160 --> 53:22.240]  article about this. You know, when the nukes were being flown from North Dakota to Louisiana,
[53:22.800 --> 53:27.040]  and they just kind of disappeared as to what was going on there and who was really
[53:28.000 --> 53:36.800]  planning some kind of a behind the scenes trumped up assault. And they've been working this ground
[53:36.800 --> 53:41.600]  for a year, but there are so many people now who are blowing the whistle on this type of thing.
[53:41.600 --> 53:46.960]  I think they may have run out of rabbits in the hat. I think the Sarah Palin nomination may have
[53:46.960 --> 53:52.640]  been the last rabbit in the hat that McCain, who's, of course, just a clone of Bush in all of this,
[53:52.640 --> 53:57.360]  has pulled out of the hat. I'm not sure they've got anything left. Well, speaking of their tricks
[53:57.360 --> 54:00.640]  being exposed, when you've got it in New Yorker Magazine and the Cheney wanted to blow up our
[54:00.640 --> 54:05.600]  own ships, when you've got the top Russian general last week, we can play it here, folks,
[54:05.600 --> 54:10.800]  coming out and saying, we know U.S. forces are planning to dress up like Russians and go around
[54:10.800 --> 54:15.680]  committing false flags. I mean, this has become so mainstream. It's their favorite tool.
[54:16.240 --> 54:21.520]  Yeah, it is. And one reason it's become mainstream is because Putin and the other
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.440]  Russians are speaking out. They're talking to the press. They're the ones who are blowing the
[54:27.440 --> 54:32.160]  whistle on so much of these things that are happening. But I think it's also essential
[54:32.160 --> 54:39.120]  to realize that behind the lines here in the United States, we have a collapsing economy.
[54:39.120 --> 54:45.680]  We have a bankrupt government. We have stagflation beginning. Is that why they're trying to start
[54:45.680 --> 54:52.080]  these wars is to get people to rally around the flag as corrupt systems have done before?
[54:52.080 --> 55:00.960]  It's always been a method of diverting attention. It's the wag the dog syndrome.
[55:01.600 --> 55:07.200]  And one thing that particularly the Republican politicians have always done and Reagan did
[55:07.200 --> 55:13.920]  this, I believe, was when the economic situation at home becomes so bad that it's embarrassing,
[55:14.480 --> 55:17.440]  you divert attention from it by going off and attacking.
[55:17.440 --> 55:20.960]  But at least he attacked Grenada, which was something that didn't, you know,
[55:20.960 --> 55:23.360]  a country that didn't have 20,000 nukes.
[55:23.360 --> 55:32.560]  Right. But this is, no, this is, of course, this is much more serious. And again, it reminds me
[55:32.560 --> 55:41.840]  of the foolishness with which people in past history have gone into Russia and have come out
[55:41.840 --> 55:47.680]  if they came out at all on the losing end of a major confrontation. Because Russia is not
[55:47.680 --> 55:50.960]  Iraq. Russia is not Iran. Russia is a world power.
[55:50.960 --> 55:54.960]  Where do you see this going? Where do you see how do you see this extrapolating and out?
[55:54.960 --> 55:56.400]  Where do you see it developing?
[55:56.400 --> 56:03.120]  I think it's going, in my own opinion, I think we're going to see things just be a talking war
[56:04.960 --> 56:11.920]  with the Westerners, with Condoleezza Rice and Cheney and everybody just kind of mouthing off
[56:11.920 --> 56:19.200]  in the press, the talking heads doing their thing against the intransigence of Russia,
[56:19.200 --> 56:24.960]  which is simply not going to back down. They're about to annex, at least South Ossetia,
[56:24.960 --> 56:34.240]  and they're not going to give Bush an inch. Even when Bush tried to use this to get the
[56:35.440 --> 56:41.440]  weapons defense system into Poland, Putin called them on that and called the Polish on that.
[56:41.440 --> 56:46.480]  I think it's going to be a stalemate into the election and that it's going to be turned over to
[56:47.360 --> 56:54.800]  either McCain, God forbid, or Obama and Biden then to try to manage their way down out of this
[56:54.800 --> 56:58.640]  tree they've climbed up into. Now, you work with Republican administrations yourself,
[56:58.640 --> 57:06.160]  but you're saying that you think Obama's better. Well, I think, I'm not saying Obama is better,
[57:06.160 --> 57:09.680]  and of course, I mean, we know. Well, Roberts is saying the same thing,
[57:09.680 --> 57:15.280]  and he's the Reaganomics Mr. Republican. We've seen what Obama has been saying about Georgia.
[57:15.920 --> 57:22.000]  We've seen what Biden has been saying about Georgia. They can't say anything else.
[57:22.000 --> 57:27.200]  Bush has painted them into a corner, but when they're handed the crisis,
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.320]  if it's they who are handed the crisis, they're the ones who are going to have to figure out a
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.720]  way out of it. Okay, Richard, Richard C. Cook, can you stay five more minutes on the side to
[57:36.720 --> 57:40.480]  finish up that thought and also give out your fine news websites? Okay, then I'm going to lie
[57:40.480 --> 57:45.040]  myself on Russian TV and then we got out of Roberts. It's no secret that Genesis Communications

[58:40.400 --> 58:47.760]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[58:47.760 --> 58:52.640]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue. With never ending late fees over the
[58:52.640 --> 58:57.360]  limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay
[58:57.360 --> 59:02.320]  all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors. The Federal Debt Relief System has created a
[59:02.320 --> 59:07.120]  successful attorney backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans,
[59:07.120 --> 59:10.960]  lines of credit and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[59:10.960 --> 59:15.280]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[59:15.280 --> 59:19.360]  ending with nothing on your credit report. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.600]  a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt. Instead of living each day
[59:23.600 --> 59:28.080]  in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around. Call the Federal Debt

[59:56.800 --> 1:00:02.640]  B. Jordan, Hurricane Gustov is charging across the Gulf of Mexico as residents flee New Orleans by
[1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:08.240]  every means of transportation available. Jefferson Parish President Aaron Boussard says he knows
[1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:14.240]  it's tough to leave. Many on the East Bank will be leaving homes that have been renovated,
[1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:19.520]  a lot of material things that that they have bought since Katrina that they cherish.
[1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:24.560]  I know there's an attraction to staying and trying to protect your house and your resources.
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:29.040]  And President Bush is being updated this morning on preparations for Hurricane Gustov,
[1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:34.480]  which could make landfall along the Gulf Coast as early as tomorrow. St. Bernard Parish President
[1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:39.440]  Craig Taferos says people need to leave now. Anyone who has not left St. Bernard Parish
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:46.960]  is instructed to do so. We are pleading with the public. Please do not remain in St. Bernard Parish
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:49.920]  for this storm. This is IRN USA radio news.

[1:00:56.720 --> 1:01:01.200]  more devastating. My body was so sore. My mind was so worn out. I could not sleep at night.
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:04.400]  I felt self-conscious. Nobody knows what that flaking is. And people say,
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:07.920]  ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty. Oh, people know when I have this embarrassing.
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:12.000]  Of course I felt self-conscious. Not very attractive to look at. The solution is new and

[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:59.920]  President Bush's GOP convention plans. Here's Mark Smith. The president was supposed to attend
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:04.400]  the St. Paul Convention as its featured speaker opening night. But the White House now says
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:09.920]  that's unlikely and fallback plans are being made that could have him speaking via video link.
[1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:14.480]  Bush is getting an update at FEMA headquarters this morning on preparations for Gustav's
[1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:20.160]  expected landfall on the Gulf Coast. Determined to avoid any hint of the foul-ups that plagued the
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:25.440]  Hurricane Katrina response three years ago, Bush has already issued emergency decrees for the Gulf
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:31.040]  and his disaster teams been working closely with state and local officials. Mark Smith, Washington.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.600]  And no deaths are reported in Cuba after the western tip of the island nation was whipped
[1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:41.360]  by Hurricane Gustav. But Cubans are returning from shelters to find flooded homes and washed
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:50.000]  off roads. At least 300,000 Cubans were evacuated. For more news and analysis, log on to IRNnews.com.

[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:27.360]  The city manager of East St. Louis, Illinois says two people have died after exposure to a
[1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:32.640]  dangerous chemical at a storage and mixing plant yesterday. At least eight people were sickened
[1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:38.720]  by exposure to the chemical. Two local hospitals had to lock down emergency rooms as a precautionary
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:43.600]  measure after taking in the chemical patients. Any people who were in the vicinity of the
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:49.280]  chemical patients had been looked after. Tess Nehaez is a St. Anthony's Hospital spokeswoman.
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:54.160]  There are 20 patients who were in rooms in the emergency room already in the process of being
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:59.120]  seen admitted to the hospital. Israeli and Palestinian leaders meant to talk about making
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:04.400]  peace. Here's Mark Levy. The meeting was the shortest yet, just 45 minutes. Israeli Prime
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:08.640]  Minister Udolmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas can't agree on one thing.
[1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:12.480]  The chances of reaching a peace accord by the end of the year are next to zero.
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:16.400]  They're still discussing the core issues that have stymied peace efforts for decades.
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:20.160]  Those are borders between Israel and a Palestinian state, Jerusalem,
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:24.400]  and Palestinian refugees. Palestinians complain that Israeli construction in
[1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:28.560]  West Bank settlements is the biggest problem now. Mark Levy, Jerusalem.
[1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:32.400]  And the State Department is urging Americans traveling to the Bahamas and the Turks and
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:38.720]  Caicos Islands to be aware of the risks caused by tropical storm Hannah. The travel alert urges
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:43.760]  U.S. citizens lacking safe shelter and who are likely to be affected by the storm to consider
[1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:48.400]  leaving while commercial flights are still available. I'm Jody Jordan and that's news
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:52.160]  from the information radio network. Oregon Kimbusters are the people's answers to

[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:33.760]  My job is very easy. I just studied the facts, the information, interview the experts,
[1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:38.720]  do my own research. The truth is actually pretty easy to find. It's just that the establishment
[1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:45.920]  counts on you being lazy, not researching, not looking into the facts and that our government
[1:06:45.920 --> 1:06:55.840]  could be hijacked and launch a sneak attack on Russian territorial areas and kill a bunch of
[1:06:55.840 --> 1:07:00.160]  people and then tell the public it's the other way around. It's an insult to all of our intelligence.
[1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:06.560]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-59-05525 and I will take some calls coming up in the next
[1:07:06.560 --> 1:07:11.920]  segment before Dr. Roberts joins us continuing with what's happening to the economy. He's a
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:17.120]  top economist and with Russia. With Richard C. Cook, I've thrown a lot of questions and points
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:22.320]  in. Just in closing, sir, any other points you need to make on the current development
[1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:28.160]  and the escalation with Russia and then, of course, on the economy which you also are an
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:34.640]  economist yourself. Yeah, just a couple things. About a year ago, I was in a hallway conversation
[1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:40.320]  with one of the Democratic presidential candidates and I'm not going to say who it was because it
[1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:49.680]  was off the record, but this gentleman said to me and I quote, this country's government is being
[1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:56.720]  run by a crime syndicate, unquote. That was a Democratic presidential candidate and he was
[1:07:56.720 --> 1:08:03.200]  talking about the Bush Cheney administration. This administration has collapsed our economy.
[1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:13.600]  It has so overextended our military in Asia that we are now very close to a shooting war with the
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:19.200]  most powerful country in that part of the world, Russia. And the one factor that's left out of
[1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:25.520]  this equation, Alex, that I have been reading about from some fairly reliable sources in the
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:31.040]  intelligence community is we take it for granted that the military is always going to salute
[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:38.320]  and do exactly what they're told no matter how crazy it is and no matter how contrary to the
[1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:43.840]  American national interest it is. And I am being told that the military, that there are people
[1:08:43.840 --> 1:08:49.840]  within the U.S. military who are drawing a line now on this Russia thing and putting the Bush
[1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:56.560]  administration on notice that they will only go so far in support of actions that are contrary to
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:00.960]  our interests. Well, look at Fox Fallon. I mean, he was the head over there, a cent com, and said,
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:05.840]  no, on a sneak attack on Iran. And he's not the only one. Well, I mean, they're constantly
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:09.360]  quitting. Guys, they thought that we're behind them and we have to ask ourselves, why are they
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:14.160]  saying no? It's not that they're even wonderful mortal people. They understand, folks, this is
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:19.360]  World War III. This is a continuity of government being activated out there at Cheyenne Mountain.
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.520]  That's correct. And the Bush Cheney administration has brought the country to collapse
[1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:32.320]  and we can't just keep walking into these traps without stopping and saying, what are we doing
[1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:37.760]  this for? Who's giving us these orders? Why are we being given these orders? And what are the
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:44.880]  consequences for our nation going to be if we don't stop now, look within, see what we need to fix
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:51.040]  at home before we continue on this path of madness abroad? And I think that there are enough people
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:57.760]  now who have this awareness that I at least have some hope that over the next year or two years,
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:02.960]  maybe a little bit longer, enough people in responsible positions are going to be able to
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:07.760]  come together and do something about it. That's my hope. Do you believe the polls that John McCain
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:12.880]  on average is about two points ahead of Barack Obama? Well, I'm not too surprised to hear that.
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:20.160]  I think Obama took a terrific beating from all of the people who are trying to arouse fears about
[1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:29.280]  him before the Democratic convention began. So I'm not too surprised to see that. But we've
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:35.120]  got a long way to go until November. Well, Mr. Cook, I mean, here's the problem. I know you've
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:39.040]  worked in the White House and at NASA and written for the Washington Post and you're a great analyst
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:44.880]  and economist and I respect your opinion. And I understand that the Bush Cheney crime syndicate
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:49.600]  is the worst expression in U.S. history of tyranny. There's nothing even close. This
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.240]  is Hitlerian. The problem is the very same Wall Street, the very same banking cartel that you
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:11:00.560]  write so much about, endorsed the PNAC plan of global domination in 99-2000. They endorsed the
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:07.120]  Bushes. They gave them free reign. And I see the same rhetoric now out of Barack Obama. That's
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:14.640]  correct. And so I just don't see it changing. No, I'm not saying it's necessarily going to come
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:21.440]  from Obama and or Obama-Biden. I think there are other people in the country in positions of
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:26.720]  authority or who have been in positions of authority, including military people who may
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:31.920]  be able to exert some influence here as we move forward. Well, I know they were ran in more U.S.
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:38.480]  troops a few weeks ago and the Russians moved some medium-range nukes in. I also know that the
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:44.240]  Georgian puppet dictator has said that he plans to attack Ossetian Abkhazia again as soon as he
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:49.280]  can. Russia says that's an act of war by the U.S. arming them. I hope you're right and that this
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:55.520]  becomes just a diplomatic war. Do you think the EU is going to put sanctions on Russia? No, I don't.
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:01.760]  And the EU already are the ones who are trying to mediate this. I mean, it was a French ceasefire
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:08.080]  that the Russians signed. And Merkel's saying don't escalate. Yes, I think there are enough people
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:15.440]  in the European community who have had enough of what Bush and Cheney have done that there
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:20.480]  is going to be some balancing force coming out of that part of the world. Again, that's my hope.
[1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:27.280]  I think, again, I want to be very clear. I'm not saying or justifying the kind of rhetoric that
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:33.600]  Obama and Biden have been putting forth. I think what they did was appalling, but they're not the
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:40.240]  only players in this game. There are other people, other forces involved in the world who are seeing
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:45.440]  the same things that you and I are talking about right now or that Paul Craig Roberts has been
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:52.160]  talking about and that at a certain point, some of this has got to come to the fore. I'm not ready
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:57.280]  to give up hope on that. What about the police state and the whole expansion of a continuity of
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:04.080]  government grid, Northcom based out in Colorado? I mean, that all transcends the Bush administration.
[1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:09.360]  I know Cheney and Rumsfeld set it up back in the 80s, the modern expression of it. Yeah. And that's
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:17.360]  one of the products of the whole economic system that has built the military industrial
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:24.560]  intelligence complex as kind of the main engine of power in the United States. But will it slow
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:28.720]  down? I mean, it wants to federalize police. It wants to have Lockheed Martin Red Light cameras.
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:33.760]  I mean, basically the military industrial complex is eating the United States right now. Can they
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:39.040]  be stopped? Can they be slowed down? Or will this organism just keep growing no matter what
[1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:44.240]  and start World War III? I think they can be stopped. I think they can slow down. I think a
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:50.240]  lot of it, Alex, depends on us, on the on the loyal opposition, on the people who call attention
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:55.760]  to this. It's not something that will happen by itself because clearly these people have all kinds
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:14:00.640]  of contingency plans. I mean, the Patriot acts were not written on the spur of the moment. They
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:07.440]  were pulled out of government files. A decade old, yeah. The same thing with the attack plans on Iran
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:14.320]  and Iraq and Afghanistan. These are off the shelf plans. I mean, these people have nothing to do
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:20.400]  except sit around and dream up wars. And sure, they've got plans and they've got facilities.
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:28.960]  There was an order that went out on official United States Army bulletin to have the army bases
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:33.760]  be prepared to take civilian prisoners off the hands of the state prison systems and put them
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:38.880]  to work as free slave labor on the army base. Yeah, that's the civilian MA labor camp program.
[1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:43.920]  Yeah. So all of that is there. I mean, we've got an enormous bottom line. We have some
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:48.880]  very bad elite in control who are out of control and they don't even know what's good for themselves.
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.080]  And they already own and run everything. They just got to have more and more and more. Why can't
[1:14:52.080 --> 1:14:57.040]  they just let us at least live? Well, because we're in economic collapse. And the only thing that
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:02.240]  they can think of to do in an economic collapse is for more people to work for the government.
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:06.160]  One trick pony and only a war economy can do that. Right. To borrow more of that. I mean,
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.920]  that's how we get out of World War II. The Vietnam War became an economic driver. And that's what
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:17.200]  Reagan did with the trillion dollar military buildup. They all do it because our economic
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:21.920]  system is structured on the basis of Asian economics. And that means government deficit
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:27.920]  spending. Yep. That means the military industry. Richard C. Cook, fire out your website. It's
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:35.520]  www.RichardC.Cook.com. RichardC.Cook.com. Read his columns everywhere. Thank you so much for the
[1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:41.200]  time. Thanks, Alex. Have a great Labor Day tomorrow. We're going to come back, cover some
[1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:47.680]  other key news. We've got another big guest coming up. infowars.com is the website in T minus 45
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:51.920]  minutes. My new film drops at Prison Planet. Have you ever felt like the United States
[1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:55.840]  government knows way too much about your financial affairs? I continue to hear stories
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:00.880]  about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:05.200]  wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
[1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:11.040]  happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of
[1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:16.560]  1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933,
[1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:20.720]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention. For this reason,
[1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:24.960]  Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:29.200]  privately. Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have

[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:54.480]  Fact. Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on
[1:16:54.480 --> 1:16:59.760]  world health is staggering. We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals
[1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:04.960]  each day. The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:10.640]  which we live, is unable to remove all toxins. The solution. Detoxification integrated with

[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:40.080]  it's a question of when. So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a category

[1:19:53.040 --> 1:20:08.000]  Again, the new film I produced directed by Jason Burmes. We're going to release it at

[1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:26.800]  coming up in just about 45 minutes. I got a lot of other news, economic news,
[1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:31.360]  police state news, your phone calls of course coming in. I haven't taken any of those yet,
[1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:33.760]  but the Russian situation was so important I wanted to cover it.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.520]  I want to thank the listeners of this show for people that aren't aware of what happened
[1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:46.880]  Tuesday. I was out in Denver and they were having a moronic recreate 68 anarchist event
[1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:52.080]  where these fools were saying they were going to levitate the U.S. Mint. Fox News lied and said
[1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:57.760]  that I said I was out there levitating the Mint. Michelle Malcolm is out there who said I lied
[1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:02.240]  about the Marines throwing the puppy off the cliff. She said I made that up. I was just covering
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:06.320]  the Associated Press. Later the Marines admitted indeed it was true and they kicked those guys out.
[1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:13.440]  She has written books about how torture is good and Abu Ghraib is good and she's written about how
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:19.600]  they put Americans in camps and I'm out there in her bodyguards and it's all on video. Come up
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:23.040]  and start bumping into me. I'm talking to her in a normal voice saying why did you write that?
[1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:26.480]  Why did you say that? I've interviewed her twice before. They came and got my face.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:33.120]  Fox News edited it to the end of it and then they lied and said that I said kill Michelle
[1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:38.160]  Malcolm. Now it turns out we have video of her leaving in the parking lot with the people
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:42.080]  that were behind me screaming kill Michelle Malcolm. Then they would scream Alex as a
[1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:47.200]  capitalist pig and stuff like that. They were just trying to incite the crowd and the Dallas
[1:21:47.200 --> 1:21:52.800]  Morning News and Denver Post have had to both do retractions. So there you go. Thank you Losers
[1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:56.960]  for calling. I've been sending them the video clips. Mark Davis at the Dallas Morning News
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:22:01.360]  sent a vicious email to my wife. I'm thinking about action against him because you know people
[1:22:01.360 --> 1:22:05.840]  think I got up and said kill this woman but it doesn't matter. It's been retracted. The lie has
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:11.120]  been exposed and those videos are all up on infoawards.com. Now I'm going to play this six
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:18.240]  minutes of me on Russian TV, myself on Russian TV last Thursday and I think I break it down well
[1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:23.120]  in about six minutes and I did this because I am patriotic and because I will not let our country
[1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:27.760]  we run this country. The people do. Start wars with Russia and then lie to the dumb
[1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:32.880]  down public and tell them that Russia started it. So here are the facts, international television,
[1:22:32.880 --> 1:22:36.320]  Russia today and you'll hear some audio in the background because they were playing videos
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:40.880]  with audio turned up a bit behind me. You can watch the video at infoawards.com too.
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:47.200]  Here it is. Russia has criticized the Western media for what it's called. It's biased view on
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:52.160]  the conflict but not all journalists blame Russia for the conflict but we're now joined on the line
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:58.320]  by Alex Jones, the US investigative journalist from the infoawards.com website to get his opinion
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:03.440]  on this. Hello to you Mr. Jones. So in your opinion what was wrong with the coverage of this conflict
[1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:08.800]  in Western media? Well Ellis thank you for having me on. First off let me say I am ashamed
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:14.800]  as an American. I'm a loyal American who loves my country but my country has been taken over
[1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:20.800]  by private international military industrial complex and they launched the sneak attack
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:27.440]  on the Russian enclaves of Abkhazia and other areas as you know on 888 using the cover of
[1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:33.920]  the Olympic games and a dastardly sneak attack on the order of Pearl Harbor in World War II
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:39.120]  and I am just so ashamed that our country has been hijacked and is being used to do this and I am
[1:23:39.120 --> 1:23:44.720]  a syndicated radio host and of course from the news site infoawards.com and that morning I was
[1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:50.240]  watching foreign news and I knew that the US backed Georgians, the Israeli and NATO backed
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:55.360]  Georgians had snuck attack viciously and were hunting down and killing civilians, attacking
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:24:01.840]  the peacekeepers, just unprecedented crimes in our modern age of 21st century and then I would turn
[1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:09.520]  on CNN and Fox and even BBC and they were reporting that Russia, it was headlines, Russia invades Georgia,
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:14.640]  Russia sneak attacks and our leaders went on television and said that we would have to have a
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:21.600]  new cold war. It was such an insult to the American people's intelligence that the United States
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:28.160]  backed Georgia attacks, snuck attack areas on your border and I apologize as an American that we
[1:24:28.160 --> 1:24:33.360]  want our government been taken over like this and this is not the United States that I grew up in,
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:38.000]  it's very very shameful, even in the Cold War our governments didn't do things like this to each
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.320]  other and the Russian people I know want to work with the American people in Europe and sell us
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:51.280]  oil and gas and neocons in NATO, in the US and Israel want to have a new cold war and that's
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.600]  why they launched this sneak attack on Russia thinking that they could intimidate Russia,
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:25:01.600]  they expected Russia to back down but Russia didn't back down and I just hope Russia keeps troops
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:07.040]  in Georgia so no more sneak attacks can be long because the dictator and we know he was elected
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:13.920]  under fraud there in Georgia has said that he plans, he said it last week, to attack again
[1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:18.560]  as soon as he can so please Russia does not need to leave these areas that have been part of Russia
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:24.240]  for years, Eucasia and Ossetia because we don't want violence, the American people don't want this,
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:29.280]  we want to be friends with Russia and the good news is for a full week our lying controlled
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:34.480]  new old-order media tried to tell us that Russia's snuck attack but the American people found out it
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:42.080]  was a lie and now it's discredited our controlled media even more and then kicking the Russia
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:48.960]  after so last week unprecedented that is a prelude in many cases to war moving missile
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:55.360]  systems and troops and more trainers into Ukraine into Czech Republic into Poland the world does
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:26:00.720]  not need this but the new old-order corporate criminals in the west do not want Russia selling
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:07.040]  cheap oil and gas to Europe they do not they want to keep the prices high Mr. James you certainly
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:14.480]  got some strong condemnation words to say rather on the media portrayal of all this but why do you
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:21.280]  think it is that western media has taken that the slot you say it has is it guided by NATO's agenda
[1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:27.600]  each other is a puppet of the military industrial complex the Anglo-American
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:34.320]  western new old-order system based in of course London and New York and DC they have hijacked the
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:38.800]  US they have implemented continuity of government they have geared up for martial law they built
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:43.680]  FEMA camps here they're destroying our republic they're destroying our freedoms they're coming
[1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:50.560]  after the free press and so they're using NATO expansion as a way to widen the war throughout
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:55.840]  Central Asia and then to the west through Eastern Europe and Central Europe and I really appreciate
[1:26:55.840 --> 1:27:01.600]  the fact that Russia has been restrained in all of this and I just want to say I am an American
[1:27:01.600 --> 1:27:07.360]  patriot I stand for my country first and I'm very sad to have to come out and speak out against my
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:13.120]  criminal government but it's going to continue under McCain or Barack Obama the PNAC documents
[1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:19.040]  written by the neocons say they want war with Russia and China the American people do not want
[1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:26.400]  it this is not strong condemnation this is a saddened American having to beg the world to
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:31.040]  understand that we've been hijacked in the US we do not like what's happening the British people
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:36.480]  do not like what's happening we want to be friends with Russia and China we do not want this but the
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:42.640]  neocons of bloodthirsty they've attacked all these countries they have just came out in New Yorker
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:48.480]  magazine the Dick Cheney wanted to stage new terror attacks a few months ago against the US fleet
[1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:53.760]  having navy seals dressed up like Iranians he wanted navy special ops commandos to attack our
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:28:01.200]  own ships to blame it on Iran we have a criminal regime we are in an emergency situation we are
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:06.640]  under martial law for all of instant purposes in the United States the United States has been
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:11.280]  taken over this is not the American people this is the corporate new world order that has seized
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:16.560]  control of England and the United States trying to bully Russia into submission Russia is not
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:21.520]  expanding Russia is not trying to take over areas Russia is trying to be free market and trying to
[1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:25.680]  be part of the world community and they're being stabbed in the back Russia has always been attacked
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:31.120]  by the British bankers for over a hundred years they do not like your strong people or your culture
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:36.080]  they want to hijack Russia just like they did with the Bolsheviks they want to hijack the US we

[1:34:12.160 --> 1:34:18.400]  treasury the father of reaganomics he helped broker some of the economic deals that took russia
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:24.560]  from being the iron curtain to a somewhat of a freer society there with its collapse in 1991
[1:34:24.560 --> 1:34:28.320]  he of course was an editor there at the wall street journal he's a syndicated columnist with
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:34.320]  creator syndicate and he is a frequent contributor to this radio show and we're always very thankful
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:39.840]  for dr paul craig roberts joining us and he'll be with us for the balance of the show and i know
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:44.800]  we have a lot of callers specifically if you have a question or comment on russia on the economy
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:50.960]  on iran we will take a few of your calls right at the end didn't take a lot of calls a day because
[1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:56.160]  i've been focused on purely news and information but he's also again in a top economist so we'll
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:59.360]  happy to get his perspective and they're very thankful for his perspective on the economy as
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:05.920]  well thanks for joining us on the eve of labor day sir you welcome out dr roberts
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:11.520]  let's get into russia and the escalation there first and then let's break down some of the
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:18.880]  things we're seeing with the economy all right there have been a lot of new developments talk
[1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:22.960]  of sanctions more troops and weapons being brought in russia calling it an act of war
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:29.920]  we have top russian general saying last week the us made stage terror attacks or provocateur
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:35.440]  false flags we have russia saying they're doing this for the election a lot of amazing things
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:44.320]  happening right now can you break it down for us yes i think so um the neoconservatives who control
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:51.760]  the republican party and the current administration and any future ones and they may also control
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:57.600]  the democrats that remains to be seen they're determined to have a war with russia they're
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:06.480]  still angry that reagan worked out diplomatic agreements with gorbachev and the soviet union
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:14.960]  and ended the cold war without without a fight they're spoiling for a fight they have broken all
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:20.880]  of the agreements that reagan made with gorbachev they've taken nato to russia's borders they're
[1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:35.200]  putting us ballistic missile defenses in former russian satellites in order to degrade the russian
[1:36:35.200 --> 1:36:41.840]  nuclear deterrent as they're hoping to be able to bully rusher and force them to go along with
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:47.120]  with whatever we want in the world and the russians simply are not going to do that
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:37:00.560]  um they have upgraded their their nuclear forces um they lack the kinds of smart weapons and
[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:06.800]  electronic warfare that the united states has and so they've announced that they will compensate
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:15.600]  for that with uh tactical nuclear weapons that if the americans encounter them with
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:21.920]  smart weapons or or electronic warfare that they will respond with tactical nukes in order to
[1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:29.280]  wipe out the american forces so we're moving very rapidly toward nuclear war and this seems to be
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:38.640]  um something joyful to the republicans and joyful to uh to the neoconservatives and to the
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:47.040]  brown shirt republicans it's very odd that the republican uh the conservative movement
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:56.320]  ended up producing a bunch of brown shirts who think they can impose by military force
[1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:04.640]  their will on the world so we are headed to war now i see just uh the other day
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:13.280]  day the general director of the russian sonor for iranian studies his name is saphiroth he
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:20.880]  has now said that uh all russia needs to do is to form an alliance with iran because then russia
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:29.760]  will control the persian gulf and so and so prodding russia is actually causing them to
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:38.080]  start expanding well that's right it's it's you see the thing is that um russia was cooperating
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:46.640]  with us in every respect and they were cooperating with europe in every respect and europe of course
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:56.880]  is heavily dependent on russia for energy so uh to go in there and threaten russia for no reason
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:07.760]  it's madness and um i think if mccain is elected uh there'll be nuclear war before his first term
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:14.080]  is changed is over hot or roberts i've never heard you talk like this i mean i know you go off
[1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:19.600]  of uh you know you have to understand that you know i held the highest security clearance is
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:26.160]  for a quarter of a century i know all the people and and they're very concerned about this so you're
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:30.720]  talking to a lot of former and current or analyst and people and i know what we're interviewing some
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:35.680]  of them here on air and they're saying pretty much the same thing you're saying yes yes they're
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:45.360]  very worried that for reasons they don't really understand the united states is provoking the
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:55.120]  entire world not just iraq and afghanistan but they're now after russia and we saw that recently
[1:39:55.120 --> 1:40:05.920]  with the with the trouble in georgia this was a former constituent part of russia for 200 years
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:17.040]  and uh we went in there with the israelis uh we uh rigged an election we elected a puppet
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:24.080]  we've armed the army and trained it and we tried to put them in the nato now we're talking about
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:29.040]  something in the caucus is so far removed from the north elanik i mean it's halfway around the
[1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:34.880]  world from the north elanik it's on the border of central asia that's right in central asia and and
[1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:41.760]  and the how european allies said no we're not going to do that because
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:47.600]  um they've got all these separatist movements there that want to go back to russia they don't
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  want to be part of georgia they used to be part of russia and style and sort of rearrange the
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:41:03.920]  borders and because solid was from georgia and if we go and make them part of nato we'll nato
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:12.320]  will be involved in civil conflict inside georgia so the french and germans and italians nixed it so
[1:41:13.040 --> 1:41:19.600]  the reason for all the trouble there was we sent a puppet in to murder all the russians and drive
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:29.600]  them out of the separatist provinces so that we would end these succession movements and georgia
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:36.480]  would be you know quote unified and we could put them in nato so you believe this was a miscalculation
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:44.400]  then because i didn't have it yeah well it was a miscalculation out of the hubris that rules and
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:49.520]  let me ask you why do you think we you know not just as an economist and former head of the treasury
[1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:53.600]  and the rest of it but you know also uh you know as a newsman the former editor at the wall street
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:59.440]  journal studying people and and knowing a lot of these neocons but not just them not just their
[1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:03.840]  imperial hubris you know their mindset of weak control reality we are histories actors none of
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:09.360]  you count you know delusional megalomania but also the public because i get emails every day i get
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:15.200]  calls people think we're lying they really think russia snuck attack georgia and i think it's it's
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:21.760]  hubris mixed with the fact that they know the average american literally has no idea even what

[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:35.200]  prisonplanet.tv right now i want to take a few calls for dr roberts but but but finishing up your
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:39.760]  the statement you were making and then my question about the mindset of the people
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:44.800]  i mean it's for an elite to sneak attack russia and then say that russia snuck attack you basically
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:51.280]  came into georgia for no reason that's a new level of orwellian lies uh... yes it's possible though
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:57.920]  because the media was concentrated as we've discussed before under clinton in 1997 there's
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:05.680]  about five oligarchs or megacorporations that own the american media it's no longer an independent
[1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:13.440]  and diverse media it's a ministry of propaganda so whatever it comes out of the white house the
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:19.920]  media repeats is truth that the rest of the world sees through this but americans don't
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:29.600]  watch world news they watch cnn fox news and networks and so they have no real idea of
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:38.640]  what of what the truth is and this is another reason of course it's so easy to lead americans
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:45.760]  into nuclear war and which is directly where we're headed the russians are not going to put up with
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:53.920]  american uh... missile bases on their frontiers they're not going to put up with the ukraine
[1:48:53.920 --> 1:49:04.160]  and georgia being uh... part of nato and they can't afford that they they're a powerful independent
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:12.560]  people they don't intend to be our puppets and so we're we had it directly into our nuclear war
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:17.760]  this is what the republicans and the new conservatives are bringing to the world and is that part of
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:23.520]  the megalomania the hubris the we control reality business yes that's exactly it but you're saying
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:27.280]  you talked a lot of high-powered people and they're saying they're really concerned and
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  don't know where this is going they're really concerned because for the first time
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:38.720]  in american history the professional people in the government have no voice
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:47.040]  they're threatened that they are neglected they're shut up they have no power see in the old days
[1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:51.520]  they could leak to the new york times but now the new york times sits on it for a year
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:57.520]  or says that and then goes and tells the government somebody has leaked to them
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:03.920]  or they lie about yellow cake and aluminum tubes not just sit on it they lie or but they
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:08.720]  well they they lied about that because that's what the government told them exactly no it's
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:16.560]  but when the nsa official the nsa guy told them that the uh bush administration was buying on
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:22.080]  americans without warrants they sat on it for one year well that's just like the new yorker magazine
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:27.760]  sat on yeah later dick cheney planted a stage terror attacks i mean that's big news yeah so so
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:33.600]  dr roberts where do you see this going as i've already said nuclear war we headed to nuclear war
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:38.800]  you think they're just going to keep pushing and pushing and moving more troops up against the russians
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:44.000]  well no they don't have any troops i mean the russians would tear our troops to peace no i know
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:49.200]  but they're moving in advisors in the client states poland ukraine they're going to provoke russia
[1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:59.040]  by putting by trying to degrade their nuclear deterrent in order to uh bully rush with the
[1:50:59.040 --> 1:51:04.160]  anti-missile systems yes right they're gonna they're gonna continue that until russia says okay
[1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:11.760]  but i meant stirring up the the the the brushfire wars well you know the other day uh the chief
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:17.440]  russian general told poland that you will die in nuclear war for putting those american bases on
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:22.560]  your territory i know that the russians are saying we will but and i saw a top progression
[1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:27.600]  general two weeks ago and i saw their new president read the nato doctrine that i'd forgotten about
[1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:34.400]  that they had started in 97 of of of nato stating it is our policy to preemptively prepare for a
[1:51:34.400 --> 1:51:42.000]  first strike on russia and to escalate and push them into this exactly but russia is doing nothing
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:49.040]  to us what is wrong with nato i mean why do these guys want nuclear war well nato the europeans don't
[1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:55.200]  buy all the european leaders are bought by the united states we simply give the leaders money
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:52:00.720]  bagfuls of money i'm not talking about foreign aid we give them tens of millions of dollars
[1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:05.680]  we guarantee their financial future now that's admitted now in fact top it's been mainstream news
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:09.520]  that our government's totally mafia and they even take over local cities like that i've interviewed
[1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:14.880]  police chiefs where they just do the the yeah c o g shows up with bags of money that's right we
[1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:21.600]  we buy people and they sell out of their own countries in order to get the money amazing
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:26.960]  let's take a call here this is incredible uh... let's go ahead and talk to jared in new mexico
[1:52:26.960 --> 1:52:31.600]  an economic question for dr roberts go ahead you're on the air first of all i'd like to think
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:35.200]  about the mr jones and dr roberts for all the great work you're doing on behalf of uh...
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:40.880]  patriotic american my question today is uh... why doesn't russia and we're trying to dump their
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:45.440]  uh... u.s reserve uh... there you thought because they're saying they're trying to work with us
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:52.880]  dr roberts well i think you gave him the correct answer they really can't believe the insanity
[1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:58.960]  of the american government they did it it doesn't make any logical sense
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:08.080]  that's uh... now china has such an enormous store of uh... american assets and treasury bonds
[1:53:08.080 --> 1:53:14.720]  that they they could dump it and essentially destroy us overnight it could come to that
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:25.040]  but they just don't really understand uh... that they're targeted for a nuclear attack
[1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:29.520]  because the americans want to rule the world they don't it doesn't make any sense to them
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:33.760]  let's make that clear the the global elite that sit in our capitals
[1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:37.760]  not the american people we have to pay for this and in closing sir in the last three four minutes
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:44.640]  we've got left the economy uh... unraveling faster than we previously thought uh... yes
[1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:50.960]  it's unraveling past and we previously thought according to the uh... way the united states
[1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:59.120]  government measured inflation and unemployment prior to the clinton administration who rigged
[1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:05.760]  both measures in order to cheat old people out of their cost of living adjustments to social
[1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:12.160]  security if we measure inflation and unemployment the way it was measured during the reagan years
[1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:20.240]  for example the current inflation rate in united states is nine percent and the current unemployment
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:29.040]  rate is fourteen point three percent that that is catastrophic because that compounds
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:35.440]  it just i mean look we used to get upset when unemployment was six percent
[1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:45.840]  or inflation was six percent as of the end of july the pre-clinton official government
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:52.160]  measures of inflation are nine percent and unemployment fourteen point three now we never
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:55:00.080]  had fourteen point three percent unemployment uh... except during the depression it was
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:06.480]  higher than the depression but that was the only time it had reached a figure of so where do you
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:14.960]  see it going in the short term midterm i don't know i don't i don't see any way low interest rates
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:22.400]  can help an economy that's maxed out on debt when people are so much in debt uh... they can't
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:33.600]  borrow anymore in order to go spend it and so i think we're in a downward spiral and um temporarily
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:41.360]  the bush administration has prevailed on european central banks on the saudis the japanese to go
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:48.560]  buy dollars to support the dollar so they can continue this low interest rate policy through
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:57.520]  the election you see the the current interest rates on treasury bonds are below the rate of
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:06.240]  inflation so the foreigners who buy the bonds simply are losing money this would normally
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:10.640]  cause a dollar crisis is that what all this militarism is like threatening the world with
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:14.720]  a gun to their head if you don't keep probing us up we'll start world war three that way
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:20.240]  it could be that it could that's what a lot of people are saying also that they're delusional
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:24.800]  because they've got a lot of space based weapons as you know a lot of secret things in the black
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:28.960]  projects black ops and and that's another reason they're so arrogant they've got some things they
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:38.320]  think and just completely uh... you know you know alex one russian ss-18 missile has 24 warheads
[1:56:38.320 --> 1:56:46.800]  anywhere on the east coast is essentially going to end existence east of the mississippi river
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:55.600]  i know 24 nerves mm-hmm so they're taking enormous risk with human life with our country
[1:56:56.880 --> 1:57:02.640]  and there's no earthly reason for it russia is not threatening us well under robert's you
[1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:08.400]  shouldn't be so upset there's ball games on there's cheeseburgers flow in the economy's great folks
