[00:00.000 --> 00:05.960]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order
[00:05.960 --> 00:11.760]  it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given
[00:11.760 --> 00:16.760]  and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. As
[00:16.760 --> 00:22.320]  president I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks
[00:22.320 --> 00:28.200]  just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic,
[00:28.200 --> 00:32.840]  and military responses. They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote
[00:32.840 --> 00:41.120]  for Trump, but if they vote for Hillary it's war. We came, we saw, we died.
[00:41.120 --> 00:45.960]  With her you'll end up in World War 3. I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the
[00:45.960 --> 00:50.760]  president we will attack Iran. Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the
[00:50.760 --> 00:57.040]  airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:57.040 --> 01:02.480]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2. Meanwhile
[01:02.480 --> 01:07.280]  Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following
[01:07.280 --> 01:11.600]  unconfirmed reports of further hacking. It's like she's not even concerned about
[01:11.600 --> 01:17.640]  the repercussions. Of course not because she's...
[01:17.840 --> 01:21.360]  All right looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties. We'll
[01:21.360 --> 01:28.880]  try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes. When the president gives the
[01:28.880 --> 01:56.880]  order it must be followed.
[01:58.920 --> 02:05.000]  Now that was a viral video we put out in the last weeks of the campaign last
[02:05.000 --> 02:12.160]  year and here we are four plus months later in 2017 and Kim Jong-un the
[02:12.160 --> 02:18.160]  hereditary dictator of North Korea fully backed by communist China, the biggest
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.080]  mass murderers in history, who we had a huge war with and lost more troops in
[02:24.080 --> 02:36.000]  Vietnam from June 25th 1950 to July 27th 1953 three years one month and two
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.560]  days. A lot of my family fought that war. Plenty Swood was in that war. It was
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.920]  bigger than Vietnam, the casualties, but it was the World War II generation so a
[02:47.920 --> 02:52.960]  big deal didn't get made about it in the news, but millions of Chinese fought on
[02:52.960 --> 02:57.200]  the side of the North poured in Douglas MacArthur wanted to use atomic weapons
[02:57.200 --> 03:03.280]  on him and he was relieved of command. Should have used the atomic weapons then
[03:03.280 --> 03:07.480]  before China had atomics when the Russians didn't have a big atomic force
[03:07.480 --> 03:15.320]  and the whole world be different now but we left hardcore Maoist slash Leninist
[03:15.320 --> 03:20.520]  in power and they always create the same nightmare hell of starving people and
[03:20.520 --> 03:27.200]  absolute hell and so now they're firing intermediate range missiles that have
[03:27.200 --> 03:33.400]  thousand kilometer range into the sea right off the cusp of Japan and it's
[03:33.400 --> 03:39.840]  safe. We're preparing to put atomic bombs on these and we're gonna preemptively
[03:39.840 --> 03:45.000]  destroy if one shot is fired even by accident or we hear a car backfire
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.500]  literally they've said we hear fireworks go off on the DMZ we're going these are
[03:50.500 --> 03:56.000]  quotes we're going to destroy Seoul and we're gonna destroy Tokyo with atomic
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.200]  bombs and why do they have atomic bombs because Bill Clinton the Democrats in
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.680]  the 90s transferred the reactors and the systems and the delivery systems to
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.680]  North Korea and China has transferred more total and complete insanity but
[04:14.680 --> 04:17.880]  Communist China is buying up Hollywood it's the biggest lobbyist group now in
[04:17.880 --> 04:22.120]  DC and the Democrats and the Republican leadership are allied with them and
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.520]  they have made the decision to try to remove our president and capitulate to
[04:26.520 --> 04:30.280]  China and the globalists and that's all part of George Soros's and Henry
[04:30.280 --> 04:33.880]  Kissinger's plan that's why Trump and the military have been trying to make a
[04:33.880 --> 04:39.880]  deal as this heated up even during the election with Russia to back us if China
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.480]  has to be preemptively struck it's the only way to stop a full-scale nuclear
[04:44.480 --> 04:48.480]  war is to use all the space-space weapons and everything else when their
[04:48.480 --> 04:53.680]  subs pop up destroy it all in 10 minutes or the entire planet will be
[04:53.680 --> 04:57.960]  destroyed I'm not calling for nuclear war but we've got to get ready to hit them
[04:57.960 --> 05:00.160]  with everything we've got
[05:00.160 --> 05:04.800]  tensions are high border wall contractors raise for a hostile environment one
[05:04.800 --> 05:08.240]  potential bidder on President Donald Trump's border wall wanted to know if
[05:08.240 --> 05:12.160]  authorities would rush to help if workers came under hostile attack another
[05:12.160 --> 05:16.080]  asked if employees can carry firearms and states with strict gun control laws
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.520]  and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force with bids
[05:20.520 --> 05:24.040]  due Tuesday on the first design contracts interesting companies are
[05:24.040 --> 05:28.360]  preparing for the worst if they get the potentially lucrative job a US official
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.480]  with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity said four to ten
[05:32.480 --> 05:36.200]  bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes they will be
[05:36.200 --> 05:40.360]  constructed on a roughly quarter mile 400 meter strip of federally owned land
[05:40.360 --> 05:45.120]  in San Diego within 120 feet of the border though a final decision has not
[05:45.120 --> 05:49.920]  been made on the precise spot Democrats vow to oppose any wall funding and many
[05:49.920 --> 05:54.040]  Republicans are also wary of this plan for a massive brick-and-mortar barrier

[08:49.320 --> 08:54.560]  we're gonna be here for the next four hours Bannon has been removed from the
[08:54.560 --> 08:59.600]  National Security Council probably for yelling at the wrong person there has
[08:59.600 --> 09:05.880]  been a lot of shouting matches and a lot of heated dates going on and you can see
[09:05.880 --> 09:12.560]  the type of stress that's unfolding we are in a very very precarious position
[09:12.560 --> 09:19.360]  on a planetary scale because communist China was backed by the Rockefeller
[09:19.360 --> 09:27.200]  Foundation in 1949 to be put into power the CIA placed Mao into control and
[09:27.200 --> 09:34.800]  blocked the Nationalist Shanghai check then just a few years later in 1950 the
[09:34.800 --> 09:45.000]  Korean War began killing millions of people the Chinese communist backed
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.720]  leader was the first of the family to be a dictator and now his grandson Kim
[09:50.720 --> 09:59.760]  Jung-un the caricature of a evil wimpy tyrant
[09:59.760 --> 10:08.640]  grotesquely narcissistic and just insane with his bloodlust his power trip
[10:08.640 --> 10:17.200]  squeezing his pathetic sad slave population one of what the devil looks
[10:17.200 --> 10:20.880]  like ladies and gentlemen it is Kim Jung-un I mean he is the epitome of
[10:20.880 --> 10:30.240]  dishonor of ugliness of weakness of failure he is the parasite even looks
[10:30.240 --> 10:39.800]  like a tapeworm good God but you look at his people there's a photo in a story on
[10:39.800 --> 10:44.280]  CNN Rex Tillerson's incredibly odd and confusing statement on North Korea no
[10:44.280 --> 10:47.400]  it wasn't confusing at all while you try to undermine our president and our
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.160]  government and the biggest crisis probably ever faced and the photo shows
[10:53.160 --> 11:04.600]  Kim Jung-un with a tank crew or crews around him and you you look at the faces
[11:04.600 --> 11:15.560]  of these people and they are just under total cultural mind control you want to
[11:15.560 --> 11:27.360]  talk about delusional mind control slaves so starved death that they don't
[11:27.360 --> 11:33.440]  even know what planet they're on now let me give me the big news here it's so
[11:33.440 --> 11:41.800]  big I can hardly get out of my mouth Kim Jung-un was given nuclear reactors by
[11:41.800 --> 11:47.520]  ABB under the authorization of Bill and Hillary Clinton when they were both
[11:47.520 --> 11:53.160]  co-presidents in the 1990s they allowed the transfer of the fissile material for
[11:53.160 --> 11:57.760]  the reactors that could be turned into atomic warheads they did that there were
[11:57.760 --> 12:00.680]  all sorts of different reactors that North Korea could have gotten that would
[12:00.680 --> 12:05.920]  not have been able to produce the fuel and this goes back to Jimmy Carter as
[12:05.920 --> 12:11.080]  well and then right through to Bill Clinton you've got the same suspects the
[12:11.080 --> 12:29.440]  Rockefeller Foundation all of them busily continually pushing for North
[12:29.440 --> 12:35.520]  Korea to be given more and more and more and more weapon systems we should get
[12:35.520 --> 12:41.560]  Joel Scalzen on who for a decade has been saying that around this time at the
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.920]  earliest 2017 the latest 20 22 that the globalist are intending to use North
[12:46.920 --> 12:54.240]  Korea as the trigger detonator to start World War three and to lure China and
[12:54.240 --> 13:01.920]  others into preemptive strikes against the United States now the word is Trump
[13:01.920 --> 13:06.920]  is aware of these plans and is actually trying to work with Russia Japan and
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.520]  others to not do this but China is belligerent they have been given a very
[13:11.520 --> 13:15.160]  strong position inside our economy inside our government inside the media and
[13:15.160 --> 13:20.880]  you ally that with the hubris and mental illness the Democrats and you have a
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.040]  recipe for disaster we have the EU piling on and attacking us so here's the
[13:25.040 --> 13:32.280]  big headline and this is even out of CNBC World War three nightmare scenario
[13:32.280 --> 13:39.000]  brewing in the East China Sea that's yesterday China is threatening to use
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.480]  nuclear weapons they say if anyone blocks their ships if anyone engages them if
[13:43.480 --> 13:48.200]  anyone doesn't go along with what they want they will attack that will then
[13:48.200 --> 13:51.560]  escalate very very quickly from conventional weapons to nuclear weapons
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.120]  if understand they've seized 90 plus percent of the South China Sea that's
[13:56.120 --> 13:58.840]  never been theirs
[14:00.200 --> 14:06.360]  understand they've brought down our AWACS before out of airspace and made to
[14:06.360 --> 14:09.960]  make emergency landings and then stolen all the equipment China is arrogant
[14:09.960 --> 14:14.520]  they've killed 85 million 84 million people under Mao another 20 million or
[14:14.520 --> 14:20.080]  so since then they keep Buddhist in cages for no crimes and sell their
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.400]  organs they're completely cut off from reality they are being lured by the evil
[14:26.400 --> 14:35.680]  force that controls them into destroying the planet and their surrogate with the
[14:35.680 --> 14:42.280]  demonic chipmunk at its head Kim Jong-un when he's not partying with Dennis
[14:42.280 --> 14:49.720]  Rodman at the Pleasure Palace he's firing medium-range missiles targeting
[14:49.720 --> 14:56.840]  Japan and having him crash into the ocean they fired more today ahead of the
[14:56.840 --> 15:02.120]  Chinese leader upset to meet with Trump in the next few days this is
[15:02.120 --> 15:10.400]  unprecedented and you have to understand in the mental illness of Kim Jong-un he
[15:10.400 --> 15:13.640]  really believes he can defeat the United States well he may defeat the planet he
[15:13.640 --> 15:20.400]  may just kill everybody because again our elites put them in power in 1949 why
[15:20.400 --> 15:26.440]  why why gotta ask David Rockefeller that he was intimately involved his father
[15:26.440 --> 15:33.040]  that whole stinking rats nest of filth that created the UN and then push
[15:33.040 --> 15:37.120]  communism and wrote editorials in the New York Times how great communism was
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.560]  under Mao you can just search engine David Rockefeller's praise for Mao
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.600]  New York Times there's screenshots of it this is the psychotic behavior of the
[15:48.600 --> 15:52.240]  Rockefellers on the globalist because they love death they love the fact the
[15:52.240 --> 15:56.000]  Chinese embrace eugenics and had a one-child policy killing over a hundred
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.480]  million of their own people they love the fact that China's on board and is
[16:00.480 --> 16:09.040]  absolutely soulless at the top their kindred spirits and after thousands of
[16:09.040 --> 16:13.200]  years feeding on the Chinese people the Chinese elite are just the most
[16:13.200 --> 16:19.440]  despicable wicked soulless creatures the planet's ever seen and then you have
[16:19.440 --> 16:24.480]  that demon Kim Jong-un rubbing his hands together hopping around on power
[16:24.480 --> 16:33.520]  trips in front of his starving minions that worship him as a god you look at
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.160]  the throngs of people in any video you see on North Korea and that's the best
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.280]  people they put forward they look like sad schizophrenic folks at on street
[16:41.280 --> 16:48.880]  corners they are just whacked out of their mind totally enslaved being fed on
[16:48.880 --> 16:55.000]  by Kim Jong-un the big tick that just sits up at the top sucking their very
[16:55.000 --> 17:02.440]  life force out and all of his generals in clown uniforms this is your big
[17:02.440 --> 17:06.080]  government this is what you worship Venezuela Cuba all of it this is what
[17:06.080 --> 17:13.280]  it creates Nazi Germany Soviet Russia nightmares nightmares nightmares nightmares
[17:13.280 --> 17:18.160]  everyone worshiping one little fat man that can hardly walk and who never did
[17:18.160 --> 17:24.760]  anything in his whole life and so now let's get to the big news Rex Tillerson
[17:24.760 --> 17:28.960]  comes out issues his final statement that if they continue to launch these
[17:28.960 --> 17:32.440]  rockets at Japan or threaten to nuke Japan or South Korea they're going to
[17:32.440 --> 17:36.400]  have to move and our trader media is like how dare you Trump you should just
[17:36.400 --> 17:39.880]  keep laying down while they fire missiles and keep threatening to nuke
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.600]  everyone and while China goes around belligerently boarding everybody ships
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.960]  in the South China Sea the most busy area in the world saying we rule we
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.600]  control we're in charge and the Chinese government saying we're prepared for
[17:54.600 --> 18:00.160]  nuclear war we have submarines off your coast we may strike you first and what's
[18:00.160 --> 18:03.400]  our elite doing trying to start a war with Russia that's doing nothing but
[18:03.400 --> 18:06.920]  trying to secure its borders and as the very same George Soros Rockefeller
[18:06.920 --> 18:10.280]  Foundation groups openly trying to overthrow them and now there's an
[18:10.280 --> 18:16.480]  article in infowars.com exclusive with the documents showing the latest
[18:16.480 --> 18:22.520]  chemical attack points right towards a George Soros funded group you cannot
[18:22.520 --> 18:26.920]  overestimate how evil these people are and how they're backing al-Qaeda and
[18:26.920 --> 18:32.680]  ISIS and al-Nusra so the world according to every geopolitical expert out
[18:32.680 --> 18:41.080]  there has never been closer to nuclear war because if they start loading
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.240]  atomic weapons on those missiles and then they've got the satellites that can
[18:44.240 --> 18:50.080]  tell the geospatial group you have to take them out you can't let them load
[18:50.080 --> 18:53.520]  nuclear weapons on missiles when a crazy person is running it saying we're
[18:53.520 --> 18:57.760]  going to nuke the most populous cities in the world you just can't do it you
[18:57.760 --> 19:00.760]  can't let them load a gun and then now they're sticking to our heads saying
[19:00.760 --> 19:04.120]  we're going to pull the trigger and we're like okay and then you watch our
[19:04.120 --> 19:08.000]  media literally being bought up by the communist Chinese where Michael Savage

[24:13.040 --> 24:18.960]  ship and state from the globalist. Yonkers Nazi air the owner of Luxembourg
[24:18.960 --> 24:24.320]  because his grandfather during World War two took it over the richest Nazi
[24:24.320 --> 24:28.040]  family or the second richest family has threatened military action against any
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.080]  states trying to leave the EU and has threatened economic warfare against the
[24:32.080 --> 24:36.600]  UK and it said he wants to break up the United States and then Nigel Farage
[24:36.600 --> 24:42.400]  comes out and says you're behaving like mafia gangsters these not some little
[24:42.400 --> 24:47.680]  gangster that you know does concrete scams Yonkers family created Adolf
[24:47.680 --> 24:55.920]  Hitler they were the second biggest armor armor armor of producing war
[24:55.920 --> 25:05.080]  production family in Germany look them up I just add that we have the EU telling
[25:05.080 --> 25:09.040]  us what to do acting like belligerent scum we've got the biggest mass murders
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.000]  in history China threatening to nuke us today we've got our media lined up
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.840]  attacking Trump and saying we've got to have war with Russia and once NATO to
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.520]  invade all these countries and and go toe-to-toe with the Russians on their
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.440]  borders and John McCain calling for physical war or saying you're Russian
[25:25.440 --> 25:31.440]  agents this is insanity if Russia was threatening to nuke the United States if
[25:31.440 --> 25:35.920]  Russia had you know all of these threats going on it had some proxy state
[25:35.920 --> 25:40.360]  like North Korea threatening to attack our neighbors and allies and friends I
[25:40.360 --> 25:47.120]  would be against Russia Russia's not doing that does Russia own most Hollywood
[25:47.120 --> 25:52.200]  now no people say well why are you backing Russia backing Russia I've never
[25:52.200 --> 25:57.560]  been to Russia I've geopolitically studied it so as Trump's advisors Russia is
[25:57.560 --> 26:02.520]  not in a posture to do anything but be economically developed but the globalists
[26:02.520 --> 26:06.560]  don't want that rich country so much times bigger than the United States with
[26:06.560 --> 26:10.640]  all those resources more than the continent of Africa they do not want
[26:10.640 --> 26:16.040]  that to be explored by the Russian people or by other corporations and
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.880]  groups that want to go in there you think the globalist can't compete with
[26:20.880 --> 26:24.400]  with one America this quasi-free because then everybody else wants to be free and
[26:24.400 --> 26:30.760]  everybody else wants to be able to have a good well life imagine if Russia became
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.280]  the new America it would it'd be the Wild Wild West it have 10 15% growth rates
[26:35.280 --> 26:41.920]  for a hundred years cities would spring up all across it people would go flock
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.840]  to Russia call it the new America it's the only big giant place that's 95
[26:48.840 --> 26:55.720]  percent uninhabited filled with resources that's why the globalists are
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.760]  so angry ladies and gentlemen because Russia is the only country that hasn't
[26:59.760 --> 27:03.720]  fallen to globalist control and now America scurrying out of its tentacles
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.400]  and now the UK is getting out of its tentacles and now they're just freaking
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.360]  out and what are they doing the EU said you accept our rule and we'll have war
[27:11.360 --> 27:16.320]  and China is saying we're pushing war because you're pulling out of globalism
[27:16.320 --> 27:23.840]  and the again Chinese dictator he's not the president he was in Davos two months
[27:23.840 --> 27:27.000]  ago we pulled the headlines up saying he'll prop up globalism he'll get
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  Trump in line and how are they doing that they have North Korea as their
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  excuse trigger firing missiles weekly into the ocean run off the coast of Japan
[27:40.000 --> 27:46.440]  threatening to nuke it and now you have Rex Tillerson three weeks ago saying
[27:46.440 --> 27:51.880]  weapons being used targeted strikes is now on the table now you've got top
[27:51.880 --> 27:58.640]  general saying maybe the only option left or start general Jack Keen well of
[27:58.640 --> 28:04.080]  China is not going to solve North Korea we will this is all I am telling you
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.600]  Trump told the Financial Times and now you've got Tillerson with our own
[28:09.600 --> 28:16.160]  enemy media CNN more and better the kindest Chinese than anything else Rex
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.040]  Tillerson is incredibly odd and confusing statement on North Korea North
[28:20.040 --> 28:23.520]  Korea has fired a ballistic missile the sea but doesn't matter it's Rex Tillerson
[28:23.520 --> 28:27.240]  who's bad listen to this North Korea launch another intermediate range
[28:27.240 --> 28:30.640]  ballistic missile the United States has spoken enough about North Korea we have
[28:30.640 --> 28:34.800]  no further comment they went oh my god what does that mean he's so amateur it
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.760]  makes no sense oh yeah one of the top corporate guys ever working over 150
[28:38.760 --> 28:42.680]  countries totally respected works 18 hours a day no he's saying we've already
[28:42.680 --> 28:49.560]  made our statement if you don't stop doing it imagine if Russia had control of
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.120]  Cuba again and was firing missiles every week one mile off the coast of Florida
[28:54.120 --> 29:00.600]  and missiles coming explode off the coast they can carry nuclear weapons we
[29:00.600 --> 29:06.200]  would be completely going crazy what do you think the Japanese are doing there
[29:06.200 --> 29:10.800]  they're in a total emergency mode right now mobilized for total war
[29:10.800 --> 29:15.000]  meanwhile you turn on our media it's demonized Trump demonized Trump you
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.480]  know somebody talking about Bannon being out right now losing his national
[29:18.480 --> 29:24.040]  security clearance because okay that's important because he's a patriot he's
[29:24.040 --> 29:26.960]  fighting for the Constitution Bill of Rights it shows the globalists are trying
[29:26.960 --> 29:29.920]  to push the Patriots out right now we don't know what happened yet but we're
[29:29.920 --> 29:35.360]  now getting in tell that Paul Ryan is who got him removed so there you go
[29:35.360 --> 29:39.320]  ladies and gentlemen we're being attacked from every side not because we're
[29:39.320 --> 29:43.520]  perfect but because we had a little bit of freedom all the tyrants don't want
[29:43.520 --> 29:47.280]  that because then their people might learn about it like the poor North
[29:47.280 --> 29:51.360]  Koreans and might want to get out of the cults they're in the government cults
[29:51.360 --> 29:58.280]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.720 --> 30:05.840]  the United States is rapidly and dangerously moving towards a war with
[30:05.840 --> 30:11.360]  North Korea retired four-star general Jack King who turned down President
[30:11.360 --> 30:16.160]  Donald Trump's offer to be Secretary of Defense says a preemptive strike on
[30:16.160 --> 30:21.440]  North Korea's nuclear facilities might be the only option we have left to stop
[30:21.440 --> 30:26.560]  them from developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S. White House
[30:26.560 --> 30:31.520]  National Security Advisor Katie McFarlane says if it fails to put pressure
[30:31.520 --> 30:37.600]  on North Korea to disable its nuclear program there is a real possibility that
[30:37.600 --> 30:42.720]  North Korea will be able to hit the U.S. with a nuclear armed missile by the end
[30:42.720 --> 30:48.960]  of Trump's first term as president. Meanwhile China has vowed to defend its
[30:48.960 --> 30:55.400]  territory at all costs if the U.S. launches a military attack against North
[30:55.400 --> 30:59.760]  Korea and you can learn more right now at Infowars.com

[33:30.800 --> 33:34.200]  the elites running our country is that they're sold out the kind of Chinese we
[33:34.200 --> 33:39.680]  can see that but we also know that from the research think about that think
[33:39.680 --> 33:43.800]  about that long and hard and then look at the traders attacking Trump for
[33:43.800 --> 33:49.320]  standing up to the North Koreans and China that are just grabbing islands all
[33:49.320 --> 33:53.840]  over the South China Sea having wars with with Vietnam's you start as

[34:00.120 --> 34:06.760]  whatever it wants threatening to nuke Japan here's the headline even CNBC
[34:06.760 --> 34:11.320]  World War 3 nightmare scenario brewing in the east China Sea and then clay
[34:11.320 --> 34:16.840]  Dillo goes over in the special report the major trigger for the war Joel
[34:16.840 --> 34:20.400]  Scalzen former Marine Corps officer really smart guy who has been predicting
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.440]  this will be the trigger for World War 3 for a decade and he's been saying
[34:24.440 --> 34:33.560]  between 2017 and 2020 or 2022 that that would happen is Trump trying to change
[34:33.560 --> 34:42.440]  that trajectory it's amazing so we're gonna be breaking all of this down here
[34:42.440 --> 34:47.640]  today but Rex Tillerson and others have said military option is now moving to
[34:47.640 --> 34:52.160]  where it looks like it may be the only option Donald Trump has said similar
[34:52.160 --> 34:55.360]  things I've already gone over those quotes but is the United States about
[34:55.360 --> 35:00.200]  to bomb North Korea the White House says the clock has now run out all options
[35:00.200 --> 35:06.160]  are on the table they're making no further comment

[35:20.840 --> 35:23.800]  haven't lived in a tyrannical country they've lived in a lap of relative
[35:23.800 --> 35:31.400]  luxury compared to any other country in the world per capita and they sit there
[35:31.400 --> 35:35.880]  and they go we'll never be a nuclear war that's never gonna happen and they make
[35:35.880 --> 35:39.800]  jokes about wanting to live under communism and they go and flip off
[35:39.800 --> 35:44.320]  communist victim memorials in DC and have celebrations about it and they
[35:44.320 --> 35:49.040]  support radical Islam coming into our countries they're fools but there are
[35:49.040 --> 35:54.680]  articles here that in Sweden and Belgium the Liberals are now running from the
[35:54.680 --> 35:58.800]  Islamic no-go zones and they tried to be cuckold and grovel to them it didn't
[35:58.800 --> 36:05.200]  work so they're now suddenly waking up but a little bit too late right a little
[36:05.200 --> 36:12.640]  bit too late for you now you have to ask yourself what is this madness our elite
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.080]  creating the Arab Spring overthrowing moderate Muslim countries putting
[36:17.080 --> 36:24.640]  horrible oppressors in charge what's happening read the article Sweden
[36:24.640 --> 36:31.720]  feminist running away from no-go zones we've had prize money for liberal
[36:31.720 --> 36:34.160]  reporters to go to the no-go zones that we've been to and have been threatened
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.880]  and been run out of they all go I want the $10,000 they get there they take
[36:38.880 --> 36:42.320]  the plane ticket from Watson they get there they go oh I almost killed me

[36:48.320 --> 36:52.200]  safe and kiss your butt they attack in seconds broad daylight police you
[36:52.200 --> 36:58.560]  nothing and it's all thug out like little bitty skinny wimpy guys will just
[36:58.560 --> 37:03.160]  come up and start beating up like six foot five guys just in the big guys just
[37:03.160 --> 37:08.800]  lay there oh I'm liberal beat me up that's why the downtown Austin they mug
[37:08.800 --> 37:12.320]  people that look like trendies seen hundreds of surveillance camera tapes
[37:12.320 --> 37:17.160]  when they come out on the news and it's just don't beat me up why I hate the fact
[37:17.160 --> 37:24.440]  I'm like I mean this is this is what's happened and now China and everybody
[37:24.440 --> 37:28.560]  else sees this and thinks the West is completely weak yes the West has been
[37:28.560 --> 37:34.880]  committing suicide and now the globalists I guess want a nuclear war
[37:36.760 --> 37:40.680]  Chicago journalists said to report on Swedish no-go zone after Trump's
[37:40.680 --> 37:44.040]  allegations the country is dangerous are given a police escort and told to leave
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.120]  for their own safety as they attract mass thugs while filming in broad daylight
[37:48.120 --> 37:53.480]  and the police won't do anything to the mass thugs and I've watched these thugs
[37:53.480 --> 37:59.520]  I mean literally I got if you know how to fight you could kill three of them in
[37:59.520 --> 38:04.280]  about a minute and a half I mean I've been in fights with guys that absolutely
[38:04.280 --> 38:11.560]  put me you know in in in near comas in the hospital okay so so let's just say
[38:11.560 --> 38:15.480]  I'm not in the top one-tenth of 1% but back when I was young I mean I could I
[38:15.480 --> 38:18.960]  could fight and let me tell you I read people who are a lot tougher than I am
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.520]  I've never seen anything like it I mean I guarantee you an average red-blooded
[38:22.520 --> 38:28.760]  American man could take on 15 of these people 15 of me they are just pathetic
[38:28.760 --> 38:32.720]  can't throw a punch stumble around if they get a hit they sit there and watch
[38:32.720 --> 38:35.720]  to see if you're gonna fall down I mean it's the craziest stuff you've ever seen
[38:35.720 --> 38:44.000]  and everyone just rolls over and that's a metaphor that's a microcosm for
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.320]  everything that's going on it's like a chihuahua up against the biggest meanest
[38:48.320 --> 38:52.760]  pit bully you've ever seen and the chihuahuas hanging off our lips snarling
[38:52.760 --> 38:56.600]  and biting us and we're just putting up with it except the chihuahuas got
[38:56.600 --> 39:04.200]  nuclear weapons and has gotten away with almost 70 years of mass murder and
[39:04.200 --> 39:08.440]  killing over a hundred million of their own people and now they're buying up
[39:08.440 --> 39:12.640]  everything and so why not why not push America around they look at Nancy
[39:12.640 --> 39:17.120]  Pelosi and Maxine Waters daughtering ding-dongs who don't even know what
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.840]  planet they're on and see weakness all they sees weakness and they're pushing
[39:22.840 --> 39:27.280]  and pushing and pushing and when they do that it's Donald Trump's fault we're
[39:27.280 --> 39:30.800]  saying whoa stop firing missiles Japan stop boarding everybody ships stop
[39:30.800 --> 39:35.840]  stealing our ships and our submarines and our water drones stop coming into
[39:35.840 --> 39:41.840]  Philippine waters and just moving in notice that the new leader of the
[39:41.840 --> 39:45.040]  Philippines first was groveling to China just a few months ago when Trump showed
[39:45.040 --> 39:48.520]  strength he said good I want to be with the US again but he thought I guess
[39:48.520 --> 39:52.480]  Hillary was getting in the deal been made to turn over most of Asia in the
[39:52.480 --> 39:57.280]  world to China as soon as they figured out that America wasn't going to leave
[39:57.280 --> 40:00.560]  the Philippines remember that got invaded by the Japanese and MacArthur
[40:00.560 --> 40:05.440]  said I shall return but as the public doesn't remember this the
[40:05.440 --> 40:09.760]  Filipinos do because they lost over a hundred thousand in World War two in
[40:09.760 --> 40:13.880]  the Philippines they were put in slave camps made to work for the Japanese oh
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.080]  but I see people don't know what already happened they already know what what took
[40:18.080 --> 40:23.200]  place in that area and that China is spoiling to get back at Japan for the
[40:23.200 --> 40:27.080]  perceived abuses in World War two that certainly happened even though it was
[40:27.080 --> 40:31.440]  Japan that was invaded over and over again by the Chinese if you want to
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.600]  start tit for tatting it's a nightmare scenario ladies and gentlemen and once
[40:35.600 --> 40:42.360]  the blood runs high in Asia it's over because the Asians historically will go
[40:42.360 --> 40:50.400]  to war just like that just like that flip that switch three million men in one
[40:50.400 --> 40:55.640]  week came across out of China when the United States had pushed in the UN force
[40:55.640 --> 41:01.240]  had had pushed them all the way back to the river and every other person had a
[41:01.240 --> 41:04.400]  rifle and when one person fell down and died they ended the other rifle just
[41:04.400 --> 41:11.200]  totally crazed in mass mob psychology flip a switch huge death waves just robot
[41:11.200 --> 41:16.720]  same deal with Vietnam and that experience and that's what we're on the
[41:16.720 --> 41:25.440]  edge of right now this won't be like fighting people in the Middle East and
[41:25.440 --> 41:29.200]  that's what our government has put us in the position of the Democrats the
[41:29.200 --> 41:33.040]  globalist giving them the nukes giving them the missiles giving them the cruise
[41:33.040 --> 41:38.880]  missiles giving them the morale and huge pillar to post launch systems the
[41:38.880 --> 41:44.600]  guidance systems the avionics the separation systems the mervry entry
[41:44.600 --> 41:51.360]  devices everything and then now that they run Hollywood every movie you go
[41:51.360 --> 41:54.960]  see about science and technology it's like thank god China gave the United
[41:54.960 --> 41:58.680]  States boosters because our rockets don't work it's all a big joke and it'll
[41:58.680 --> 42:02.120]  actually show people playing the Chinese president going I will save America
[42:02.120 --> 42:09.480]  I'm their boss with red flags behind them I mean we now in America have Chinese
[42:09.480 --> 42:14.320]  central committee propaganda on TV
[42:19.520 --> 42:26.360]  so that's where we stand that's where all this is going and I guess that's just
[42:26.360 --> 42:30.000]  what Democrats and liberals everybody want this is what you're into you are
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.760]  sick but see most of you are just followers you see the Soros bots and
[42:34.760 --> 42:39.840]  all the bots out there that ridicule this show we talk about things and make
[42:39.840 --> 42:44.160]  jokes about nuclear war and jokes about pedophilia everything's funny to these
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.440]  nihilistic bots and the people that load them with their comments and then weak
[42:48.440 --> 42:51.640]  little minds sit there that have never lived in the real world and they sit
[42:51.640 --> 42:55.920]  there and they make jokes about this all day long not knowing that we're on the
[42:55.920 --> 43:03.760]  precipice with the whole world the EU dictatorship the communist Chinese the
[43:03.760 --> 43:12.120]  Democratic Party the MSM the Republican leadership all ganged up on the small
[43:12.120 --> 43:16.080]  beachhead we have in our government of nationalism and sanity and strength and
[43:16.080 --> 43:20.320]  productivity and just that little sliver of light coming through a crack in the
[43:20.320 --> 43:24.400]  blinds a crack in the curtain has licked the room up and we see the economy
[43:24.400 --> 43:27.320]  turning back on and all these good things happening and we have all these
[43:27.320 --> 43:36.120]  enemies running around celebrating what they believe is the beginning of the
[43:36.120 --> 43:42.680]  destruction of Trump it's like people pouring gasoline on themselves and
[43:42.680 --> 43:46.720]  preparing to strike a match laughing because when you burn up Trump you
[43:46.720 --> 43:50.480]  burn yourselves up morons and notice people are saying why are you
[43:50.480 --> 43:53.680]  addressing the leftists and the globalists they're not gonna listen some

[44:14.480 --> 44:23.160]  1953 I'm going for memory on that July 27th 1953 and it was only a ceasefire on
[44:23.160 --> 44:31.680]  the demilitarized zone the DMZ and China as a communist blaggart is trying to
[44:31.680 --> 44:40.960]  take over the whole region it's disgusting Vietnam finally got smart
[44:40.960 --> 44:44.880]  became capitalist is becoming wealthy beyond their wildest imaginations
[44:44.880 --> 44:52.520]  that's all they've got to do China's building new mega cities bigger than
[44:52.520 --> 44:59.160]  Uruguay and more populist in Germany Chinese leaders have bragged oh let us

[45:16.240 --> 45:24.800]  leader the dictator. I remember 20 years ago when our news was talking about the
[45:24.800 --> 45:30.840]  Chinese dictator elected by the Central Committee they don't do that now they
[45:30.840 --> 45:39.600]  sit there and they lie directly to your face I'm not saying nuclear war is going
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.240]  to happen I'm saying the trigger has never been worse and even mainline analysts
[45:43.240 --> 45:47.520]  concur with that and admitting how much danger we're in and admitting what we
[45:47.520 --> 45:53.640]  face will help it not happen but you see the ignorance and the decadence and the
[45:53.640 --> 45:57.480]  evil and and and the pedophilia and all the things that are happening in the
[45:57.480 --> 46:08.280]  West and you you just know that we're begging for it. Trump and Z two imposing
[46:08.280 --> 46:17.560]  leaders with clashing agendas they're not leaders Trump is elected Z is not the
[46:17.560 --> 46:21.480]  Central Committee made up of the grandchildren the original communists
[46:21.480 --> 46:28.720]  and children has the Politburo that it appoints that then it has voting I mean

[54:31.880 --> 54:35.520]  South Korea Trump is saying look we can't keep letting you do this we're gonna
[54:35.520 --> 54:39.440]  have to strike your sights and keep doing it and so now the liberal media is
[54:39.440 --> 54:42.400]  attacking Trump like it's his fault when it was the Clintons that gave the
[54:42.400 --> 54:48.080]  missile secrets and the nuke secrets publicly that's mainstream news to North
[54:48.080 --> 54:52.320]  Korea here's the headline Bloomberg Bannon loses national security counsel
[54:52.320 --> 54:56.960]  role in Trump shake up but then I read this a White House official said that
[54:56.960 --> 55:00.480]  Bannon was placed on the committee in part to monitor Trump's first national
[55:00.480 --> 55:03.600]  security advisor Michael Flynn and never attended a meeting he is no longer
[55:03.600 --> 55:08.040]  needed with McMaster in charge of the council that official said so are we
[55:08.040 --> 55:12.560]  kind of panicking and inadvertently is he really not losing power with the
[55:12.560 --> 55:17.920]  constable insider Roger Stone joins us Roger what's really going on well Alex
[55:17.920 --> 55:24.360]  as we reported yesterday here on info wars calm there are still internal turf
[55:24.360 --> 55:30.560]  battles and power struggles sadly in the Trump White House one of the things I
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.560]  learned under Ronald Reagan and before him president Nixon was that a White
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.760]  House divided against itself like a campaign divided itself cannot stand
[55:41.760 --> 55:46.040]  that everyone has to be pulling in the same direction and in this case that has
[55:46.040 --> 55:52.360]  to be the president's direction I reported correctly yesterday that Jared
[55:52.360 --> 55:57.840]  Kushner the president's son-in-law and also a policy advisor a special
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.640]  assistant to the president I believe in this administration has been feeding by
[56:02.640 --> 56:09.560]  text Joe Scarborough one of the leading Trump critics in the media a derogatory
[56:09.560 --> 56:15.760]  information at the expense of Mr. Bannon and other White House tidbits that
[56:15.760 --> 56:22.600]  play into the internal struggles some media outlets claimed that I told you
[56:22.600 --> 56:28.600]  yesterday that Kushner was leaking intelligence information to Scarborough
[56:28.600 --> 56:34.760]  that's not what we said nor what we discussed but I do think that this is
[56:34.760 --> 56:40.840]  at least a loss of public status for Steve Bannon and the reason this
[56:40.840 --> 56:47.600]  concerns me Alex is because as you know Google and Facebook and the other
[56:47.600 --> 56:54.640]  internet giants are moving aggressively to choke off alternative viewpoints to
[56:54.640 --> 57:01.720]  the mainstream media declaring info wars Breitbart daily caller stonecoldtruth.com
[57:01.720 --> 57:08.800]  where you can read all of my stuff as fake news if there's anyone inside the
[57:08.800 --> 57:16.080]  Trump White House who should understand this issue and understand the anti-trust
[57:16.080 --> 57:22.800]  issues that are triggered by Google's activities it is Steve Bannon a man who
[57:22.800 --> 57:29.280]  came from alternative media and therefore any loss of power or influence
[57:29.280 --> 57:34.800]  is a bad sign for the future of the net well let me just say I liked what he
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.520]  did at the New York newspaper that he owns was the New York observer did some
[57:39.520 --> 57:42.080]  pretty good reporting over the years I don't want to be enemies with with
[57:42.080 --> 57:45.000]  Kushner if he delivers on being a patriot he could he could probably be
[57:45.000 --> 57:48.200]  president I think down the road is kind of what this dynasty building is doing
[57:48.200 --> 57:50.840]  if it ain't gonna be Trump's daughter it's gonna be you know Kushner I mean
[57:50.840 --> 57:54.480]  clearly that's what they're setting him up for but I just don't understand being
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.720]  involved with that weasel you know Joe Scarborough and now the media is
[57:58.720 --> 58:02.760]  making jokes everywhere oh we think he's Illuminati oh we think he's leaking
[58:02.760 --> 58:06.720]  intelligence we didn't say that we just said he's talking to Scarborough we have
[58:06.720 --> 58:11.880]  our moles they don't even deny this by text a constant text back in force
[58:11.880 --> 58:18.080]  between them look I have nothing obviously against Jared Kushner he's a
[58:18.080 --> 58:24.520]  very bright and very able guy but he's a liberal Democrat and he brings the
[58:24.520 --> 58:29.920]  point of view of a liberal Democrat I'm not sure he understands the Trump
[58:29.920 --> 58:35.520]  coalition I'm not sure he understands the info war watcher absolutely stay
[58:35.520 --> 58:39.560]  there I'm the backbone of the Trump revolution we are back in 70 seconds

[1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:24.960]  the boys tell how found your fellow and left his living in a cheap old town
[1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:34.400]  this is quiet Cleveland's cold so the story in we're told I don't need your
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:38.840]  prayers is true Roger Stone is our guest for one more segment and then we've got a
[1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:43.560]  bunch of other guests on every major issue you can imagine but I fear for my
[1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:48.200]  family's safety legitimately at a gut level an intellectual level over this
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:51.840]  North Korea situation and so I want to just shift gears briefly the Roger Stone
[1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:54.960]  who knows the president Trump very very well I talked a lot of folks in the
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:58.240]  military and intelligence who've told me some about Trump that months later you
[1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:02.360]  see in the news region says gloves are off green light first day told the
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:06.160]  military all these al-qaeda groups had them I talked folks that were there in
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:09.680]  these meetings and then you see it later come out in the news months later I
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:13.840]  mean so Trump is a real man of action so I'm almost I know we take a picture
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:18.480]  like the China and others but at the same time I get really concerned they
[1:01:18.480 --> 1:01:21.920]  realize that Trump's not playing around and his generals aren't playing around
[1:01:21.920 --> 1:01:26.640]  so knowing Trump what would you what's your message to the communist dictator
[1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:32.240]  and in North Korea you know Alex I think you're absolutely right in this sense
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:38.320]  Donald Trump reminds me very much of Ronald Reagan you know he has a genial
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:44.000]  manner he can speak to anyone but underneath all of that is raw steel
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:50.600]  he is the toughest individual I have ever met I've seen him at the negotiation
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:56.360]  table I've had the unfortunate experience of negotiating compensation
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:01.440]  deals with him over the years when I have worked for him and he's a very very
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:07.920]  tough and resolute guy he's extremely stubborn when he sets his mind on a goal
[1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:14.840]  this is not the marshmallow that Barack Obama was who draws lines in the sand
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:20.840]  and then watches our enemies cross them and does nothing this is not you know
[1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:31.400]  Bill Clinton who could have taken out the Osama bin Laden and did not he's a
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:36.560]  very resolute guy I think the North Koreans may have bit off a bit more than
[1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:41.120]  they can chew what what do you make of this I mean clearly what do you think
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:45.720]  is gonna happen the next few days when he meets with the Chinese dictator well
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:51.640]  I think he purposely upped the rhetoric going into the meeting to start on
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:56.840]  offense at the same time I think the head of the Chinese government will find
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:03.320]  the president to be polite and genial but he's not going to budge he has had a
[1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:08.760]  long-held view that the Chinese are taking advantage of us in a thousand
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:13.480]  ways whether it is the hacking and pirating of our technology or whether
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:19.520]  it is these one-sided trade deals he wants to have a better relation with
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:24.640]  the Chinese he understands that this is an enormous nation with millions and
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:30.840]  millions of people but the days of the United States being a patsy are over
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:35.040]  and Donald Trump I think is about to prove that we've got a minute and a
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:40.360]  half left other political tidbits you'd like to relate to folks well Alex I'm
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:44.640]  going to join you as you know later today at two your time you're hosting
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:49.360]  the fourth hour and we're gonna delve deeper into the Scarborough question
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:55.200]  we're going to lay out exactly how we learned what we learned without names but
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:58.840]  we're also going to talk about what's going on in the White House and we're
[1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:05.040]  going to focus on the Google threat to our future freedom this is coming down
[1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.520]  hard and fast I know you're experiencing it at Info Wars we're
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:14.800]  experiencing it stone cold truth calm must respond I mean their political
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:18.920]  bases being strangled much less the First Amendment Congress must act or be
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.800]  this is insane or the Justice Department who I think have a very clear
[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:28.680]  antitrust or tortuous interference absolutely I talk to my lawyers it's the
[1:04:28.680 --> 1:04:31.440]  very definition of it and then they have David Brock and everyone admitting
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:34.840]  their meeting with Google and everybody to censor us I mean it's just all out
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:39.840]  in the open well you were the first to point out to me Barack Obama's ministry
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:46.040]  of truth which I presume is prodding all of these internet companies to declare
[1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:51.600]  things fake news so this is actually a government directed shut down and it's a
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:55.240]  behind-network deep state he created this deep state department in one of his
[1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:58.840]  last bills he signed on December 6 and then here we are thank you Roger we'll
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:03.280]  see you there for our four tensions are high border wall contractors braced for
[1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:07.360]  hostile environment one potential bidder on President Donald Trump's border wall
[1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:11.240]  wanted to know if the 40s would rush to help if workers came under hostile
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:15.440]  attack another asset employees can carry firearms and states with strict gun
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:19.800]  control laws and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force
[1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:24.000]  with bids due Tuesday on the first design contracts interesting companies are
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.840]  preparing for the worst they get the potentially lucrative job the US
[1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:31.520]  official with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity said
[1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:36.120]  four to ten bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes they will be
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:40.280]  constructed on a roughly quarter mile 400 meter strip of federally owned land
[1:05:40.280 --> 1:05:45.080]  in San Diego within 120 feet of the border though a final decision has not
[1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:49.840]  been made on the precise spot Democrats vow to oppose any wall funding and many
[1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:53.960]  Republicans are also wary of this plan for a massive brick-and-mortar barrier
[1:05:53.960 --> 1:06:01.360]  you can find more reports as we try to build a wall at info wars.com this is

[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:56.880]  a decade he's been saying it for 15 years and of course he was a Marine Corps
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:09:01.680]  officer and a lot of other things he knows his stuff and a lot of his family
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:06.840]  has been high-level in the FBI and other areas that's why his family has been
[1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:10.040]  exposing the globalist takeover plan for 60 years
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:14.000]  Leon Scousen the list goes on and on so he's got a lot of good information for
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:19.760]  us coming up I don't think the globalist want war right now and Trump's
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:23.520]  trying to stop globalism so that course is getting changed some but that's what
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:27.440]  could then trigger this in my expert view and I do research this in great detail
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:32.480]  let me tell you something anybody making jokes about this is out of their mind
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:37.720]  and I always notice the most uninformed softest people think nuclear war is a
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:43.280]  joke because it hasn't happened yet if it ever happens folks the only way it
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:52.880]  happens survival would be to pre-target and pre-strike China and even if one
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:59.080]  submarine didn't get taken out 10 missiles into the West Coast East Coast I
[1:09:59.080 --> 1:10:04.120]  mean you just can't it's unbelievable and you now see the secretary of state
[1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:07.600]  the general saying only option could be striking North Korea because they say
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:11.600]  we're gonna load atomic some will nuke Japan any any moment will nuke Korea
[1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:18.400]  South Korea meanwhile Maxine water snakes that Putin invaded Korea that's
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:22.200]  who we have running things yep there it is US may have no choice but to launch
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:25.440]  preemptive strike on Kim Jong-un's nuclear facility says four-star general
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:30.080]  who's close to Trump it goes on and on they say the clock has run out let's go
[1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:34.000]  to Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network and of course he's a
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.280]  law enforcement training group and also a well-known respected private
[1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:41.680]  detective who comes highly recommended over the years from our sources he has
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:47.240]  FBI sources also state police sources and and others in multiple states there
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:52.600]  on the East Coast about what was in the WikiLeaks months before it came out in
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:56.040]  the news about Wiener being looked at for child porn the rest of it
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:01.040]  everybody got diverted off to the whole pizza deal but I wanted to get him on
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:05.000]  for an update on this but also just what other chatter he's hearing the open
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:14.320]  calls that we are now seeing from the media that they want a overthrow of
[1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:18.520]  Trump using COG we know the Communist Chinese are openly lobbing for that and
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:22.960]  at Davos bragging they're doing it so the world is precariously in a giant
[1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:27.640]  Mexican standoff right now everybody's got guns pointed each other and jokers
[1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:31.520]  threatening to military action Europe of countries pull out that's an elected
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:35.200]  head of the EU but it's like oh he's the president of the EU council he's a
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:41.200]  dictator his family took over Luxembourg he owns Luxembourg because the Nazis
[1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:46.720]  took it his grandpa gave it to him I mean you can't make that up so Doug
[1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:49.560]  Hagman thank you for joining us we've got our investigators out on the West
[1:11:49.560 --> 1:11:53.320]  Coast getting a lot of intel from law enforcement on the pedophile rings more
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:56.560]  arrest all the time they caught a big ring reportedly shipping underage
[1:11:56.560 --> 1:12:01.280]  Chinese girls around in California just two days ago so many reports coming I
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:05.720]  can't keep track of us so Doug where do you want to start well I think that's a
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:09.920]  great place to start Alex I've been watching you keeping track on your
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:16.720]  coverage of this and I think that we're seeing the consequence of some low-level
[1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:23.800]  targeting of the the pedophile network that was uncovered through the document
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:30.800]  grabbed by the task force NYPD FBI task force under under the right around
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:35.320]  election time so I think I think we're seeing the the results of that right now
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:40.160]  and no one's really happy at the moment that this is going so slow and it seems
[1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:45.400]  to be going painfully slow and I agree why don't they just go after the big
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:50.800]  fish and let's get things rolling here certainly would love to see some some
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:55.280]  high-level people in prison orange being perp walking from the cameras and I
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:58.440]  think that's one question that we have to ask is why isn't that taking place
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:03.400]  right now but I think there there are multi multiple levels of this Alex and
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:10.680]  one aspect that we're covering that I had mentioned some time ago is the if I
[1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:18.080]  can divert just briefly to this the four IT staffers well three IT staffers
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:24.200]  specifically the awan brothers and I know that you've covered some of this the
[1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:30.160]  awan brothers had were escorted out of the capital supposedly back in December
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:38.200]  there were up to 20 office break-ins the capital office break-ins by perhaps by
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:44.120]  or allegedly by the at the hands of the three awan brothers awan brothers that
[1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:48.320]  were up have been working for congressional staffers or Congress
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:55.040]  people I'm sorry so this be a plumber type operation well actually worse than
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:00.280]  that this is this is Islamic infiltration at the highest levels of our
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:05.200]  Congress and George Webb an independent citizen journalist has been doing a
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:11.360]  great job of uncovering this on YouTube but the long and short of it is very
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:19.600]  simply back in 2005 congressman Gregory Meeks had hired Imran or awan to do his
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:27.400]  IT work as things progressed Irwan Imran awans two other brothers came to work
[1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:36.000]  for a total of 31 Congress people congressmen and women between 2005 and
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:43.280]  2017 or 2000 well yeah 2017 it was on January on or about January 2nd of this
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:48.240]  year were all three of the awan brothers were escorted from the capital
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:54.000]  grounds because of an alleged procurement scam with respect to computer
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.520]  equipment at the capital building but just to really cut this right to the
[1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:04.320]  quick here right now it has investigation and the results of our
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:10.000]  investigation Mr. Webb's investigation has proven or shown that the awan
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:16.080]  brothers Pakistani nationals and their wives two wives of the three brothers so
[1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:21.560]  a total of five people were getting paid as IT consultants for 31 Congress men
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:29.760]  and women since 2005 through the 2nd of January of 2017 but they were they
[1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:37.680]  actually and I'm saying this now I'm fully saying this they hacked into the
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:45.440]  computers of the 31 congressmen and women of which a good percentage of them
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:50.440]  were on three of the highest level committees including the home one
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:56.000]  security committee the one of the biggest scandals five years ago was the
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:00.400]  CIA caught spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee okay but now
[1:16:00.400 --> 1:16:04.080]  we've just got Islamist groups doing it and notice it citizen journalists that
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:07.840]  first broke this I'm glad the Daily Caller says exclusive but the point is
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:10.520]  that citizen journalists doing the ferreting I'm just giving credit to the
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:14.720]  people out there know how important they are it's kind of like Mr. Sarnovich
[1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:20.240]  broke the the info on Susan Rice gets credit nowhere and it's the one of the
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:24.860]  biggest stories in the country now confirmed Wall Street Journal has more
[1:16:24.860 --> 1:16:29.920]  people than just her reportedly doing it total proof of indication for Trump so
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:33.680]  again it just keeps coming from the grassroots we celebrate the grassroots
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:38.400]  go ahead well yeah exactly and what we're seeing here as we're putting these
[1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:44.600]  these connecting these dots or these layers of criminality coming from
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:50.800]  within so we've got domestic enemies infiltrating and infiltrated our all
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:54.500]  levels of government including the executive branch the judiciary as well
[1:16:54.500 --> 1:17:00.560]  as the legislative branch so as we watch for example the news break about Susan
[1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:06.000]  Rice saying I didn't do nothing to nobody or whatever her comment was that
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:10.800]  there's some integration between that and the cover-up of the Awan brothers as
[1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:15.800]  well as there is integration between that and the DoD spending and I'm
[1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:21.640]  connecting a lot of pretty far apart dots here that and the defense spending
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:28.120]  which is going to kind of pale in comparison to what's breaking on a
[1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:32.520]  geopolitical level worldwide with respect to the situation of North Korea
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:36.000]  China and the United States that's right it Trump's coming out saying Susan Rice
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:40.600]  may have committed a crime no Rand Paul's right she committed a big crime a
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:45.320]  big crime I'm asking for political purposes it's it's total felony it's
[1:17:45.320 --> 1:17:50.160]  it's absolute dirty pool Nixon did one micron of this and was gone and should
[1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:57.240]  have been so what needs to happen at well bigger picture here well yeah the
[1:17:57.240 --> 1:18:01.720]  because of the complexity of this and people have a tendency to want things
[1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:07.480]  broken down into Twitter bite Tourette's syndrome style reports but the bottom
[1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:11.040]  line here is that this is all interconnected and what we have totally
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:15.200]  compromised and the Russians and Trump aren't the threat trumps the answer and
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:19.720]  and they've had a year of this going on there's nothing there they admit there's
[1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:23.240]  nothing but they keep trying to recycle it but it's clearly losing steam right
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:27.360]  now where do you think this is going well and this is a lot of this is to
[1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:30.160]  cover up Hillary Clinton's connections with the Russians I mean of all people
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:35.480]  and of all parties it's the Clinton the Clintons the Clinton Foundation and the
[1:18:35.480 --> 1:18:40.920]  Democratic National Committee that has that has the relationship with the
[1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:44.360]  Kremlin or with with Russia that's why but that's in the WikiLeaks cooked up
[1:18:44.360 --> 1:18:47.600]  the Russian thing he says push Russia push Russia because he knew he was
[1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:53.080]  being investigated right exactly so this is so upside-down and backwards and
[1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:56.560]  and it takes a lot of time to really untangle it's like in the old cop movies
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:59.240]  you know they're based on true stories where you catch the guy and he goes no
[1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:02.360]  he did it you know it's like they point the finger at the guy that doesn't even
[1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:07.320]  have the bag of money in his hand exactly yeah and and right it's almost like
[1:19:07.320 --> 1:19:12.080]  musical chairs with with felony can felony charges potentially felony
[1:19:12.080 --> 1:19:16.080]  charges but when you look at the Clinton for example the school
[1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:21.160]  covo found foundation her relationship with the school covo foundation which is
[1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:27.000]  Russia backed you look at all of these connections it's not Donald Trump it's
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:31.440]  not the Republicans it's not the new administration the Republicans have
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:35.240]  never been in bed with the Russians that's well known right exactly and then
[1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:39.640]  the Russians are under well I shouldn't say the Russians the Communist the
[1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:44.760]  Communist doctrine is the undergirding of the globalist intent the agenda so the
[1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:49.640]  big picture from a view from spaces when you look at this it is the globalists
[1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:55.520]  who are attempting to with Islam with Junker the EU with the Chinese all ganged
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:59.160]  up on us America's in a fight for its life and Japan and England are coming to

[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:19.040]  asked about Steve Bannon we're gonna play that club we start the next segment
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:22.680]  we've only got six more minutes right now with Doug Hagman you definitely want
[1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:27.440]  to visit his website we'll put that on screen for TV viewers in a moment I'm a
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:33.520]  father I'm also somebody that studied politics and history that's why the
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:36.080]  uninformed people can think oh this kind of don't he's talking about to the
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:39.160]  inform they go wow this guy's got his research well so does Doug Hagman so
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:42.280]  those people like Joe Scousen I get the best brains with the best long-term
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:47.440]  analysis on and everyone concurs that the biggest threat to peace and life on
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:51.360]  this planet is the North Korean Peninsula of the South China Sea we heard
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:55.960]  that from him 15 years ago Joel Scousen come up in the next segment
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:00.040]  they're they're globalist forces that think they can survive a nuclear war
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:04.440]  they have given weapons to North Korea and China to be a threat it is it's
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:09.480]  insane it's evil like pedophilia or any of this what is going on you got these
[1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:13.440]  authoritarian brainwash regimes it's just it's out of control so what's Trump
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:16.720]  supposed to do when they say we're gonna load atomics on a missile and shoot it at
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:22.760]  Japan for no reason and they're firing missiles weekly almost hitting Japan so
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:28.040]  Doug Hagman your analysis of that and just the waterfront general analysis of
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:32.440]  your federal sources of what they think of Trump at this point yeah I have to
[1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:38.960]  say this Alex I would defer anything in that realm to Joel Scousen he's got
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:43.240]  these got the contacts he's got the experience and I certainly would defer
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:49.040]  to him his expertise because he again he knows you know as much more about that
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:51.920]  aspect of things that I could share but just in general as you were saying you
[1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:55.280]  look at the battlefront worldwide the globalist forces we're in a war right
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:00.120]  now exactly and that's part of it and on my and when I look at my side of things
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:04.960]  on the domestic side what I'm hearing from my FBI sources one confirmation I
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.880]  got from both in the FBI source as well as an agency source or CIA source saying
[1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:17.640]  watch the role of the National Geospatial Agency the NGA as well as the NSA in the
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:22.080]  upcoming days with respect to the leaks that are coming or that had come out
[1:26:22.080 --> 1:26:27.160]  about the Trump administration but also information that has yet to come out
[1:26:27.160 --> 1:26:31.200]  that will be dropped here within the next couple of weeks there's more to come
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:38.440]  with respect to the allegations of not not Donald Trump and the Russians but
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:45.200]  the other members of previous regime Obama Jared in particular Valerie Jarrett
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:50.640]  with respect to Iran and Russia there there's more to come with respect to
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:54.760]  this they got admittedly penetrated and bought off by Russia and that's why
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:59.960]  they're freaking out so much right now exactly so this I would expect the
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:04.600]  next 72 hours to be critical in terms of the information that will be coming out
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:08.920]  and I'm gonna be very interested to see and Alex I'm wondering what your
[1:27:08.920 --> 1:27:14.680]  thoughts are will we see Susan Rice testify under oath in front of a Senate
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:17.920]  committee or will it just be hauled in front of it and she should be indicted
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:21.040]  immediately she clearly committed crimes they lied to the public and said they
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:26.440]  didn't do this I mean arrest them all exactly yeah I'm just you know I when
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:29.280]  I'm hearing is we're about to have nuclear war folks it's time to arrest
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:32.640]  Hillary Clinton we've got to save the country the world the world's never been
[1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:36.080]  in more danger they're the ones that made everything radical Kim Jong-un
[1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:40.200]  Hillary all these other scumbags Yonker all of need to be arrested they're all
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:43.760]  calling for war they're all involved in criminal activity arrest all of them I'm
[1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:49.280]  serious yeah no I 100% behind you and I think that the American while
[1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:53.200]  Americans don't have we can't wait the world isn't too much danger we have to
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:56.360]  stop these people and I've never talked like this in 20 years folks we have these
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:28:02.040]  people all must be rounded up I'm sorry no they must because they brought us to
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:09.760]  this point and they have sold us out the Korean situation if fueled by Iran Iran
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:21.240]  of course yeah yeah so we've got this this this melting pot of this this
[1:28:21.240 --> 1:28:27.080]  really sewage pot of strife worldwide that was brought we got to this point
[1:28:27.080 --> 1:28:32.400]  because of Obama and right now and Clinton especially and by the way
[1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:36.400]  Hillary Clinton played a significant role under Madeleine all right during
[1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:41.520]  Clinton the Clinton presidency as the shadow Secretary of State to bring us
[1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:45.520]  to this point as well and then moving on as Secretary of State under Obama so
[1:28:45.520 --> 1:28:50.720]  this has her fingerprints all over the place and here we are you know at this
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:55.760]  at this level so much more to get into but watching the next really 72 to 96
[1:28:55.760 --> 1:29:00.320]  hours with respect to the the taps why would our in just one minute why would
[1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:04.760]  our elite even though they're evil why would they want to not have Russia on
[1:29:04.760 --> 1:29:09.440]  our side during this China crisis why are they trying to bring Russia down

[1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:34.720]  imprudent to do that obviously but these people that we're dealing right as you

[1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:30.200]  probably longer I've interviewed scousen for 19 years or something we're gonna go
[1:33:30.200 --> 1:33:36.600]  to the editor there at world affairs brief here in just a moment if people

[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:06.440]  we are having trouble getting more after having it for four plus years it is
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  getting more from the deep gas wells that they drill when they find it at seven
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:14.040]  to 12,000 feet so this couldn't be in the last round of that like we couldn't
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:17.720]  get this really clean kelp anymore and we're in crisis about five years ago and
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:21.600]  then discovered this but you got to go to the DEA and have licenses this is the
[1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:26.160]  real stuff I mean not the particular bottle it's put in a gaseous form and
[1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:29.840]  then it's super high quality but it's not pure iodine from the crystals that'll
[1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:34.640]  eat a hole for the floor I mean it's like a pure element and if you go into all
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:38.760]  the science of it the point is it's the good halogen if you want that it's

[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:27.480]  front and we hope to fix all this peacefully but clearly you can see
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:30.440]  where the world's going you can see how they're trying to undermine nationalists
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:35.840]  like Trump and nationalists like the new British Prime Minister you can really
[1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:41.120]  see old crazy you know Nazi heirs like Juncker coming out on the unelected
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:45.320]  dictatorship and threatening everybody you can see all the other military
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:49.440]  threats and economic threats globalism is in crisis and and I believe
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:53.160]  Trump's for real and he doesn't want to take us on the course to world war three
[1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:55.640]  down the road that the globalists were planning we're trying to get off that
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:59.640]  course but I don't think they were gonna let him do that and it may trigger it
[1:35:59.640 --> 1:36:03.240]  him trying to stop it now being strong with North Korea and and Scousins broke
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:07.040]  this down from so many angles we're gonna go to him again in a second it's

[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:47.600]  is how they strangle our Republic and then the Washington Post has the nerve
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:52.280]  to have the headline democracy dies in the dark and the New York Times says the
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:57.000]  truth lives here that's our old slogan that Bekton took or the truth's alive
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:02.320]  it's at info wars it's crazy and I'm not even that good folks it's just that
[1:38:02.320 --> 1:38:06.240]  we're putting up a defense with Americana we didn't invent it we're trying to
[1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:11.320]  resurrect it and they are absolutely freaking out right now if you just go
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:14.440]  to the Washington Post it's their master you can see it on their website
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:19.560]  underneath the term Washington Post so info wars store.com info wars life.com
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:26.520]  or triple 825-33139 and whatever you do get our articles get our videos get the
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:31.840]  material and send it out via email and personally to everyone you know human
[1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:36.420]  power can crush the bots the algorithms in Google they got defeated in the
[1:38:36.420 --> 1:38:40.400]  election they're getting defeated everywhere they're getting defeated in
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:43.200]  France they're getting defeated all over they're in panic mode so you're now
[1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:48.440]  seeing their full force and threats of war with old weird Nazi fossils you know
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:52.560]  that hijacked Luxembourg crawling out of the Sur line like you know the clown it
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:56.640]  threatening everyone so this is a mega important how to be alive we'll find out
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:00.640]  what Joel Scowleson of World Affairs brief has to say right now about the
[1:39:00.640 --> 1:39:05.320]  statements of we may have nuclear war we may abstract these targets all of this
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:10.560]  with him right now Joel. Alex it's good to be with you as you know I've been
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:14.280]  predicting that North Korea will be the trigger event for World War 3 and it's
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:19.320]  one of the reasons why Russian China tolerated a young crazy man Kenyum Il
[1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:24.800]  Kenyum the current leader because it's very very convenient to have a war
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:28.200]  start with a crazy man so that even Russian Chinese say hey we don't control
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:33.720]  this guy it's not our fault but I have always said that you know Russian
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:38.880]  China controlling North Korea may postpone that war into the next decade
[1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:43.320]  because Russian China's military isn't ready yet this Friday I'm about to issue
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:47.880]  a new brief in the World Affairs brief changing that prediction just because
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:54.120]  the rhetoric is heating up so much about preemptively stopping North Korea that
[1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:59.480]  it could trigger World War 3 earlier in fact I'm worried that they may want to
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:04.760]  blame this war on Trump instead of having a normal globalist in there they
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:08.760]  may want to have this is the ultimate take down to taint his reputation forever
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:14.040]  if this war starts now in fact is KT McFarland who's a rabid neocon and so
[1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:17.600]  is H.R. McMaster running the National Security Council by the way they just
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:22.080]  demanded that Steve Bannon be taken off that council because they didn't want
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:26.680]  someone loyal to Trump hearing their deliberations after they got rid of
[1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:31.320]  Flynn who wasn't an insider you know they put H.R. McMaster in there and KT
[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:35.800]  McFarland and this is a very much an insider neocon outfit that's going to
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:41.560]  drive us toward war I don't believe McFarland statement this is part of
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:47.520]  the old mantra of saying we're going to get North Korea to step down from a
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:51.280]  nuclear problem we've done that three times before and we've had a treaty
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.000]  every time they backed out of it they've you know denied international
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:59.680]  inspectors and cheated on the treaty but we keep fulfilling our part of it I
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:04.720]  used that as my basic rationale for saying there's got to be a reason why
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:08.720]  they treat Iran with such hostility who doesn't even have a nuclear weapon yet
[1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:13.960]  and Iran they treat with kid gloves they say no military option on the table no
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:20.120]  regime change required and they do these trees Iran cheats or North Korea cheats
[1:41:20.120 --> 1:41:23.040]  and they still fall through with oil deliveries they still fall through with
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:27.440]  money and releasing sanctions if they do this all over again that means that
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:31.720]  they're still on the same track I've written in my brief that the one thing
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:35.880]  that Trump could do that wouldn't appear to trigger the war that could stop
[1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:40.440]  North Korea is to simply use our ages naval missile systems to shoot down any
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:45.600]  ICBM tests that North Korea launches over international waters it's legal
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:49.360]  they're headed towards Japan that's a threat to Japan they can shoot them down
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:54.240]  and that would stop North Korea from delivering now of course North Korea may
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:41:58.960]  take rash action and and trigger the event but I don't think they do so without
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:04.120]  the permission from from Russia and China but for the first time Alex I'm
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:08.520]  worried that my timetable may be accelerated because of Trump being an
[1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:12.680]  office because he could be the one to take preemptive action and it could
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:17.860]  start World War three so people really need to increase their preparedness ZG
[1:42:17.860 --> 1:42:21.880]  Ping and the comments Chinese let's talk about what drives them their alliances
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:25.600]  with the old globalist order that deal it seems to be kind of breaking up a
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:29.520]  little bit how Russia plays into this but first Joel I've never you know
[1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:34.160]  interviewing you 19 years heard you be this dire I mean we're seeing you talk
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:38.320]  of well the only thing on the table may be you know hitting their sides you know
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:43.440]  the clock has run out the statement by the Secretary of State today saying we
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:46.560]  already made our statement no further statement no more talk I mean that just
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:50.760]  sounds like action is about to happen and so I guess we're gonna have some real
[1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:54.960]  brinkmanship coming up in two days when the Communist Chinese dictator comes to
[1:42:54.960 --> 1:43:02.800]  a I guess visit President Trump but you know the in my theory there are three
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:07.320]  globalist centers of power competing for one another there's the Anglo-American
[1:43:07.320 --> 1:43:11.960]  globalist that we deal with in the West and NATO the Atlantic Alliance etc then
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:16.760]  there's Russian China who want to establish their own independent global
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:20.840]  new world order with them in control they intend to fight each other eventually
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:24.080]  but they're in a temporary alliance to take down the West and that's what
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:28.280]  World War three is is all about that's why they're preparing massive weapons of
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:34.080]  mass destruction but both Russian China play up to the current globalists you
[1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:38.000]  know they have invite Rothschild they invite Kissinger and they have talks
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:42.160]  and part of that is just feeling each other out seeing how much they can
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:46.400]  deceive one another but I have always resisted those that have said that
[1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:51.840]  because Rothschild or Kissinger visits Putin that Putin's a globalist he is not
[1:43:51.840 --> 1:43:56.080]  a globalist under the control of the Western globalist he's a competitor and
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:00.240]  he's intending to annihilate them and and China with nuclear and China's
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:04.960]  intending to annihilate us in Russia but so this is going to be a very complex
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:10.040]  thing we're working out and the main reason as you talked about in the other
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:14.400]  that the globalists have suddenly turned against Russia instead of being
[1:44:14.400 --> 1:44:19.240]  complacent and permissive about Russia is because Russia has the capacity of
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:23.440]  destroying the terrorist agenda in the Middle East the US and British
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:30.160]  intelligence created ISIS they created al-Qaeda they in night in 2013 they
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:37.240]  pulled a a false flag chemical attack on Damascus to blame it on Assad that
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:41.200]  triggered the red line of Obama who's getting prepared to attack Syria and
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:46.000]  now they've been caught again doing it today exactly and I'm covering that in
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.840]  the world for this is got all the marks of a false flag operation first we have
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:54.200]  the very groups bragging their problem is they're all noser of people love to
[1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:58.000]  be rock stars so they're not completely controlled so we have the video of the
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.040]  attack a few years ago where they're loading the chemical mortars of I mean
[1:45:02.040 --> 1:45:06.280]  it's all there they're so uncoordinated that they brag when they do it the media
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:10.040]  puts out that you know it's it's Assad but then their own little minions want
[1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:13.560]  to be rock stars so they shoot videos of it and brag we have that on info wars
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:17.360]  dot com new breaking stuff but this was a little more sophisticated this time
[1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:22.720]  they enticed an airstrike from Syrian aircraft upon their position in the
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:28.240]  building province province and at the same time those bombs fell they exploded
[1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:32.480]  a chemical bomb yes setting off the chemical warfare so that they could
[1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:37.160]  blame it on the as if it was an aerial deliver bomb remember Syria gave up its
[1:45:37.160 --> 1:45:41.680]  chemical weapons in 2014 certified by international inspectors number two
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:47.880]  gas attacks are broad area weapons that have no military value in a rebel
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:51.160]  conflict fighting among civilians all it does is turn the civilians against you
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:55.760]  that's right that's no motive to do it that's right unless you meant to kill
[1:45:55.760 --> 1:45:59.520]  civilians for the purpose of poisoning public opinion against Syria and that's
[1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:03.880]  exactly what they did and number three there's no way Assad would use chemical
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:06.880]  weapons against civilians knowing that the international community is just
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:11.240]  waiting for him to make a mistake just where what military advantage we're
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:14.320]  about a red line number two well of course and we've already caught them
[1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:17.520]  once it's called the telltale signs Syrian girl whose family was from the
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:21.880]  former ruling party she's got all the intel the articles up on info wars.com
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:26.200]  but Joel let me just back up for a minute here you do have globalists trying to
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:30.480]  play off the Anglo-Americans the Chinese the Russian combine the globalists in
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:33.760]  their writings admit there are three major centers of power you know they
[1:46:33.760 --> 1:46:37.280]  pretend like it's monopolar it's not even bipolar it's obviously beyond you
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:41.560]  know a tripolar and you count into just nationalistic or movements of liberty
[1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:45.480]  that could you know be a fourth or fifth movement but if you're looking at this
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:50.080]  clearly the globalist are trying to siphon and play games and make the
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:53.560]  Anglo-American be the dominant group in the end and as you've broken down
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:56.760]  correctly I wouldn't call it a theory it's a fact from doing my own research
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:47:00.920]  of what they're saying but Trump truly trying to shake this up and create
[1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:04.640]  prosperity again and not totally get rid of all the globalism but just not make
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:08.720]  it so predatory towards everybody and try to head off this coming war that he
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:12.440]  knows they're planning because he wants to have golf courses in wealth and his
[1:47:12.440 --> 1:47:15.800]  kids to be president and he isn't a Satanist he's not perfect he's not a
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:20.640]  Satanist how to get us that's really shaking up their system but then I kind
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:23.960]  of like you were saying it's like it could accidentally maybe trigger it but
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:27.400]  then you can't just back down to the belligerents you need to get in the
[1:47:27.400 --> 1:47:31.120]  belligerents face before they have weapons that can match what you're doing
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:35.080]  so things have gotten wild but then he brings in more and more of these
[1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:40.400]  globalist neocons in and it appears is starting to soften on some fronts I
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:44.120]  think it's because there's total mutiny the deep states ignoring everything he's
[1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:49.320]  saying and it's it's just an unprecedented time to be alive well it's
[1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:54.120]  very interesting to watch this gambit of the false flags chemical attack in
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:59.520]  Syria worked against Trump Trump came out and condemned Assad for killing
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:03.040]  innocent people and women and so he's bought into this so he doesn't
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:09.920]  understand that his own security forces created ISIS he doesn't understand that
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:13.040]  they're still working there they're still altering the targets they're still
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:17.900]  letting ISIS leaders escape sure do you think Madden argued this because he's
[1:48:17.900 --> 1:48:20.720]  known to argue do you think he argued in the meetings yesterday and the day about
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:25.800]  this and then got shut down it's very possible and that's why he had to be
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:29.760]  removed they don't want that kind of voice in there remember too that the
[1:48:29.760 --> 1:48:36.440]  White House is in chaos because of the fact that the bureaucracy is not
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:40.280]  controlled by Trump they're starting to basically go back to their Obama agenda
[1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:43.040]  I mean they're bringing in hundreds of thousands of refugees they're not even
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:47.600]  vetting them now the IRS guys still there I mean it's just right none of that
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:51.720]  has been cleaned out Alex and so what Trump has done which is a mistake
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:57.680]  instead of applying a basic ideological format and filter and bracing he's
[1:48:57.680 --> 1:49:01.280]  trying to co-op them but their ideologues on their mission they're not
[1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:04.280]  mercenaries Trump thinks they're mercenaries and if he just gives them
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:08.480]  power he'll carry out the agenda no they want to destroy this system and bring
[1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:12.720]  in the tyranny it's about total domination it is but Trump is making a
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:17.600]  mistake by surrounding himself like he does in business with extremely loyal
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:23.600]  carefully selected people like Jared Kushner is his son-in-law but Kushner
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:27.760]  is a Democrat at heart what do you make of Kushner I mean we've confirmed we
[1:49:27.760 --> 1:49:33.000]  have the sources he is leaking against people in the administration thinking
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:38.440]  it's a power struggle when he's the one wounding Trump well you know Trump
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:43.400]  trusts him implicitly I mean look to send Kushner to Mexico to China to
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:47.920]  negotiate it and to Iraq I mean Kushner has no background whatsoever to
[1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:51.120]  understand he doesn't understand any of the conspiratorial issues involved with
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:56.240]  any three of those countries how could he negotiate but Trump is not looking for
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:50:01.760]  answers as much as he's surrounding the the wagons and and basically trying to
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:05.640]  stop the leaks by saying I'm only gonna talk to my insider group and it's a real
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:10.040]  mistake he really needs to purge the traders that are in the administration
[1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:14.320]  you think Kushner consciously is betraying the president no I don't I
[1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:18.000]  think he's loyal to it he just doesn't know what he's doing and he is trying to
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:22.520]  work this infighting thing by you know trying to attack people on the outside
[1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:27.360]  and there's the media is just having a laughing fit at all the infighting going
[1:50:27.360 --> 1:50:31.960]  on in the administration they just say this thing is exploding let me ask you
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:36.080]  if the American people can do to try to continue this route of the globalist I
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:40.080]  mean it's spreading globalism is exposed it's in trouble finally and you know
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:46.040]  Trump is not our only only card but I tell you I tell you I'm not abandoning
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:49.400]  Trump at any front these are a lot of great things it's just that letting
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:53.280]  Kushner and others sit there I mean I don't care family or not I caught somebody
[1:50:53.280 --> 1:50:56.040]  doing something like that in my life they would be out of my life in two
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:50:59.400]  seconds I'd say you get your stuff you get your ass out here I'm never talking
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:04.560]  to you again hi there dick all guyer here I was a mainstream television news
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:10.480]  reporter for over three decades I normally never do commercial endorsements
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:14.840]  I am very skeptical of health supplements but a friend of mine told me
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:19.760]  about his experience with synergy one so I purchased a bottle and my wife and I
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:24.560]  have been using it for a few weeks now I very much dislike so-called energy

[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:37.160]  have to go I forgot to ask him during the break for all the fairs brief.com I'm
[1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:41.840]  Alex Jones with info wars.com normally if they try to censor you it makes you
[1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:45.920]  the bad boy and everybody wants to come see what you're doing and saying unless
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.280]  they're successful at shutting you down and they are hitting us on every front
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:55.640]  economically it's actually dizzying but then all I do is go and ask you to buy
[1:54:55.640 --> 1:55:01.680]  the products and and some sincere about it and a lot of what we've had taken away
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:04.800]  from us has ended up coming back in but then I wonder you know the attacks
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:10.600]  continue down the road it's it's it's it's gonna start crippling us and I let
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:14.080]  the enemy know it's having that effect because all I have is transparency here
[1:55:14.080 --> 1:55:18.280]  I'm not gonna sit here and say oh we're you know we're doing wonderful I want to
[1:55:18.280 --> 1:55:22.600]  expand in the face of this and so I do not want what they're doing to us to cut
[1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:26.040]  into that so I'm just telling the listeners if you want to win this fight you
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:28.920]  need to go to world affairs brief calm and subscribe to it to film which all

[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:03.920]  prayers and your support by spreading the links and articles everybody out
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:08.400]  there because that's the real power you have but Trump needs to go in with
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:11.720]  Congress and get rid of this this ministry of truth Obama set up and the
[1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:15.680]  stay-behind networks of the deep state and the open rebellions good news is
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:19.080]  happening with Susan Rice and all the truth coming out on that it's just that
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:23.280]  once one line is exposed they move on to a new hoax so Joel what do you think the
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:27.560]  president should do what do you think they're trying to isolate him but I know
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:31.760]  that he does routinely watching listen to segments of the show especially if I
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:34.680]  say measures the president from Alex Jones he's told me several times and
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:38.720]  staff have told me about it as well so in this little segment the next I mean
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:41.000]  what would you like to say to the president but also the American people
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.080]  what can we do because this is the historic battle that we're entering is
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:50.760]  not it is you know Trump I listed in last week's World Affairs brief for
[1:56:50.760 --> 1:56:54.000]  example four or five things that Trump has done that have been absolutely
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.920]  stunning and fulfilling campaign promises stopping the TPP starting to
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:03.560]  build a wall taking a handcuffs off the border patrol in the ice to start
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:09.600]  deportations and he's you know taken away the climate control agenda that
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:14.640]  Obama mandated he's taken away the clean coal restrictions that Obama which would
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:19.520]  have destroyed the coal industry all those things are excellent it was the
[1:57:19.520 --> 1:57:25.200]  health care thing was a disaster but in reaction to that even though Steve Bannon
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:28.280]  you know he said you know you need to put together a list of the bad guys and
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:33.000]  remember who betrayed you in this but Trump fortunately went golfing with
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:38.160]  Rand Paul this week and got an earful about how to do this properly
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:43.400]  he needs Rand Paul's help doesn't he he really does and I was frankly surprised
[1:57:43.400 --> 1:57:47.200]  that after all the vindictiveness all the revenge that he expressed against the
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:51.640]  freedom caucus that he would go golfing with Rand Paul and listen to him about
[1:57:51.640 --> 1:57:55.760]  how to do this and I think Rand Paul has an effect I went in detail the last
[1:57:55.760 --> 1:58:01.920]  week's brief Rand Paul's proposal I'm sad to say that that Rand did compromise
[1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:06.280]  after talking with the president say well we can still accept some form of
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:09.320]  subsidy just by not repealing that part I know what they're doing they're hitting
[1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:12.320]  the liberal side of Trump they're like sir these people are going uninsured and
[1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:15.560]  you know you can mend fences that it's never gonna happen it's gonna bankrupt
[1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:21.520]  the country just slower we have to kill it yeah and but I still think that Rand
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:27.680]  Paul is the way to go that he will in fact you know have a proposal that can
[1:58:27.680 --> 1:58:32.760]  fly in Congress here's what Trump needs to do first of all he needs to get
[1:58:32.760 --> 1:58:36.520]  control of that bureaucracy I mean this is just utterly unacceptable let's talk
[1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:39.400]  about how we do that as a former Marine Corps officer how would you get in
[1:58:39.400 --> 1:58:42.800]  there I think just people aren't doing their jobs anyway just fire basically
[1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:45.400]  everybody that doesn't immediately do what they're told I just start randomly
[1:58:45.400 --> 1:58:50.040]  firing everybody they won't even hang his photos up at the age we'll be back
[1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:56.440]  there was a mighty nation rest above all of creation Charlie Daniels he's always
[1:58:56.440 --> 1:59:00.080]  loved America let me just read a little thing here the American system of
[1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:04.160]  justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world individual rights
[1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:07.640]  we'll have to take the backseat to the collective well you know the next
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:11.320]  boost gonna be don't you it's gonna be coming if you're good oh yeah I take it
[1:59:11.320 --> 1:59:14.840]  ain't gonna sit well down my way at all it ain't gonna sit well do you ever
[1:59:14.840 --> 1:59:20.560]  wonder what happened to America they lost we won want to see what Trump's up
[1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:25.000]  against it's time to ride boss we need a thousand paul with ears when I was a boy
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:31.560]  it was okay to be proud of the flag heritage mom and apple pie and beef was
[1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:36.400]  for supper revelation dawn of global government theatrical screenings on
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:41.600]  demand DVDs now available starring Alex Jones Charlie Daniels special ops
[1:59:41.600 --> 1:59:46.280]  general Jerry Boykin want to shed some tears over the red white and blue
[1:59:46.280 --> 1:59:55.040]  revelations the movie that info let's fix it you're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:59:55.040 --> 1:59:57.560]  show
[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:08.760]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:26.400]  GCN radio network all right Joel Scowzen is our guest I'm gonna open the phones
[2:00:26.400 --> 2:00:32.240]  up specifically on the North Korea Peninsula the South China Sea geopolitical
[2:00:32.240 --> 2:00:36.520]  issues that's a wide area he's with us the bottom of the hour then mainly we
[2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:42.000]  was gonna pop in on our pedophile network report that we're doing out West
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:46.280]  really hardcore investigations with law enforcement and others that are letting
[2:00:46.280 --> 2:00:50.360]  us in to see their files and information I told Millie you don't have to look at
[2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:56.480]  all this and so and I said I wouldn't look at it so we actually told the police
[2:00:56.480 --> 2:01:01.960]  and others no we just want to see how they're doing it on the dark web how
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:06.920]  that's happening and expose this where I'm not looking at so I will not look at
[2:01:06.920 --> 2:01:10.240]  it would hurt you just to look at that I mean warn everybody folks I would not
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:13.560]  ever look at even an investigation child porn I don't know how people even do it
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:18.560]  so we're gonna be getting into all of that I've never seen such pushback to
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:21.160]  when we start getting into the whole pedophile networks and Satanism and
[2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:27.400]  folks it's so huge I've met with so many people that are involved with you name
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:30.600]  it I can't really say all the agencies and they just say Alex it's even worse
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:37.280]  than saying and then we can't ever get above the procures three levels up it
[2:01:37.280 --> 2:01:41.160]  just gets killed by major police departments you name it it's it's
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:48.280]  protected and twelve-year-old girls you know going around delivering drugs on
[2:01:48.280 --> 2:01:51.880]  top of having sex with people is the tip of the iceberg and that's done just out
[2:01:51.880 --> 2:02:02.400]  in the open now so but I'm not gonna say any more the problem is I learn all
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:05.800]  this stuff and then I get chewed out of I even talk about any of it so I'm I'm
[2:02:05.800 --> 2:02:09.040]  like I haven't talked about any of it I'm just gonna stop right there and I
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:12.280]  also tend to shy away from all this because I don't like focusing on it I
[2:02:12.280 --> 2:02:16.200]  don't like it I've got children and it makes me feel angry it makes me feel
[2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:20.960]  quite frankly violent and then I start blowing up which is not an act at a
[2:02:20.960 --> 2:02:26.480]  certain point it's just a switch gets flipped and that's why I've been lacking
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:30.800]  covering this the last decade a decade ago or more I covered it a lot that's
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:34.800]  how Paul Watson got hired because he was in Britain he sees it all the news so
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:39.000]  that's coming up the bottom of the arm the toll free number to join us is 800
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:44.240]  2599231 some stations don't carry this first five minutes a lot do you a little
[2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:47.040]  bit different clock and format that's why I've got Joel sitting there on hold
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:49.600]  because I want him to be able to speak for about five minutes directly the
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:52.840]  president we're gonna edit it together later and put it out as Joel Scousins
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:56.840]  you know a warning to President Trump so that he can actually you know not have
[2:02:56.840 --> 2:02:59.440]  me cutting in over this we're gonna come back from break and give him the
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:01.960]  floor for a couple minutes but just two minutes before we come back and do that
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:09.320]  Joel the toll free number is 800 2599231 800 2599231 first-time callers or
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:12.880]  folks that got good phones is all I'm asking in the minute and a half we have
[2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:17.680]  left before we go to break other it kid tidbits you mean you were revising your
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:23.440]  forecast that's been pretty much dead on you've been saying for well 18 19 years
[2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:29.120]  ago you said between 2017 and 2020 nuclear war triggered in Korea then the
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  last few years you said well more like they're behind schedule so you'd say
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:37.520]  maybe 2020 2022 you said this hundreds of times here now you're going oh no let
[2:03:37.520 --> 2:03:41.280]  me we're take it back to what I said you know 19 years ago that's that's pretty
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:46.280]  spooky when you've got such credibility with your track record well it is true
[2:03:46.280 --> 2:03:50.600]  that Russia and China aren't ready but that doesn't mean that they may not see
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:55.160]  as tactical advantage and the globalist may see attack them you know normally
[2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:58.320]  I've always said the globalist can't start this war they have to wait for
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:03.320]  Russian China China to start it but it looks like the scenario is waking up
[2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:07.160]  where they came through globalists that are trying to manipulate Trump they can
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:11.120]  get him to preemptively work or strike against North Korea and trigger World
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:15.800]  War three early now that actually is to the advantage of the globalist because
[2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:19.720]  if they can get Russian China to go to war before they're fully ready then
[2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:25.400]  there's a greater chance that they can beat Russia now as I've also said in
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:29.960]  strategy wise I think the globalist during this war will cut a deal with red
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:34.400]  China to betray Russia to attack its rear just as they made it you said that
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:39.440]  over 10 years ago and clearly now Russia is on the menu I mean there they
[2:04:39.440 --> 2:04:43.520]  really want war with Russia so clearly it's up next right and Russia's going
[2:04:43.520 --> 2:04:46.800]  down I believe I don't believe they're gonna win this war but it's gonna be
[2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:50.240]  devastating due to some military because our government is gonna absorb a
[2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:54.680]  nuclear first strike in order to justify getting us into a militarized
[2:04:54.680 --> 2:04:59.240]  global government but it is true that the Russians listen to the show we'll be
[2:04:59.240 --> 2:05:03.680]  back tensions are high border wall contractors raised for hostile

[2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:25.600]  win world government I don't want the Russian establishment to have it the
[2:08:25.600 --> 2:08:30.440]  Communist Chinese I want a world based on productivity and being open and
[2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:34.760]  honorable and on what you actually produce and what you stand for and I
[2:08:34.760 --> 2:08:38.360]  want to believe in our species and I want us to go to the next level and I
[2:08:38.360 --> 2:08:43.400]  want us to be open and free and then quite frankly a true Christian system
[2:08:43.400 --> 2:08:48.840]  we don't force people to free will but we need to be open to build our free open
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:53.880]  systems that then everyone can see are the model doesn't mean I'm on some high
[2:08:53.880 --> 2:08:57.560]  horse doesn't mean I've got all the answers but I'm not out to get people
[2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:02.760]  and Trump undoubtedly has a spirit of productivity and wealth and he likes
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:07.360]  seeing people doing well he's very hard nose but he isn't out to get people like
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:11.240]  a Marilyn Albright or others that like you being poor you know who's father
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:16.760]  robbed the Jews and she was Jewish or towards sorrows the same story the
[2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:20.320]  other Communist Chinese this is there's a wickedness where they want you poor
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:24.720]  they want you it's feudalism under their control could have seen humanity
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:29.720]  blossom it's very anti-human like the Bible says a fallen one here to deceive
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:34.040]  here to destroy us here to steal our future you can say well that's that's the
[2:09:34.040 --> 2:09:37.000]  Bible I don't believe it okay well whether it's real or not and of course
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:43.400]  it is not men's interpretations but what it is is is already here it's all
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:09:46.040]  proven they're announcing micro chips to work at all these companies
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:49.640]  Associated Press brain chips for the troops it's all just being announced
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:58.360]  down like it's no big deal so great evil is coming upon the earth right now and
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.400]  the big mega churches are controlled folks and so I don't know what we're
[2:10:04.400 --> 2:10:07.360]  supposed to other than just spread the word take action I want to take some
[2:10:07.360 --> 2:10:10.640]  phone calls here but Joe Scowzen just you got cut off by the break earlier
[2:10:10.640 --> 2:10:14.600]  thank you for joining us today editor in chief of worldfirstbrief.com has been
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:19.000]  you know right on target with the whole North Korea situation for close to two
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:23.120]  decades that I know can you get into then what you think the president should
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:27.680]  do with this mutiny of the deep state where they're acting like Obama never
[2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:31.960]  left Obama said he would do that just the arrogance what does the president do
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:34.920]  I know he doesn't want to look too mean well they're the ones that are an open
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:39.920]  rebellion in major elite publications saying overthrow the president you see
[2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:43.600]  OG to overthrow the president I could cease months ago that's what they were
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:46.680]  setting up now they admit it I don't think they got the idea for me I could
[2:10:46.680 --> 2:10:50.040]  see what they were preparing they may make a real run at the president so can
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:53.320]  you brief him in the next you know five ten minutes and we'll take a few calls
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:59.640]  on what you think is number one threat ish and then what you would do well the
[2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:03.680]  number one threat to Donald Trump here are the globalists of neocons that he's
[2:11:03.680 --> 2:11:08.520]  allowed to get an administration about 50% he you know that's in there in some
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:12.120]  of the most important positions now they're in the national security council
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:15.680]  they're in the Department of State and they're in the Department of Defense and
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:19.080]  so they're controlling foreign policy and that's why he's getting bad
[2:11:19.080 --> 2:11:22.480]  information about the Syria false flag attack now here's how you control that
[2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:26.800]  first of all you've got to get control of the bureaucracy when George W. Bush was
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:31.880]  president his handler was vice president Dick Cheney Dick Cheney expanded the
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:37.200]  vice president's office from a staff of approximately 15 to over 600 he had
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:43.400]  people in every agency of government dictating watching over filtering and
[2:11:43.400 --> 2:11:46.920]  making sure that people obeyed what he wanted to do and it wasn't you know
[2:11:46.920 --> 2:11:51.720]  George W. Bush was basically and from his huge residents down the street from
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:55.240]  that from that building he ran the whole show yeah from the National
[2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:58.520]  Observatory where the vice president's residence is and they and during his
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:02.160]  tenure he built a great big nuclear underground bunker underneath that that
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:06.000]  building so that the vice president had a personal bunker against nuclear attack
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:10.720]  the government obviously knows this is coming so the second thing that Donald
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:16.040]  Trump needs to do immediately is repeal PDD 60 that is the presidential
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:22.520]  decision director that basically instructs our nuclear forces to not launch
[2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:27.640]  on warning but to prepare to absorb a nuclear first strike PDD 60 is a
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:32.200]  devastating thing and Trump doesn't even know about it I'm convinced now the
[2:12:32.200 --> 2:12:37.680]  third thing he needs to do is to get a briefing from people who understand the
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:41.760]  globalist conspiracy I'm convinced he does not understand the details he
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:45.520]  understands in general there is a globalist conspiracy without knowing the
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:49.800]  details especially as it pertains to foreign policy false flag operation
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:55.280]  terrorism 9-11 creation of ISIS he cannot operate with a general feeling
[2:12:55.280 --> 2:13:02.180]  about globalism the third thing he needs to create is an Ombudsman for the
[2:13:02.180 --> 2:13:05.640]  conservative movement for his own supporters if you will in other words
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:10.440]  he needs to have someone who people on this side of the spectrum can contact we
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:15.360]  don't have any way to contact the Trump administration to organize and rally his
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:20.000]  true base exactly and you do that by giving them ability to give feedback
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:24.280]  someone who has direct access to the president to take that feedback and who's
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:29.200]  sympathetic to it who will not filter out things just because they have the
[2:13:29.200 --> 2:13:32.520]  taint of conspiracy and Bannon was supposed to do that but then he got so
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:38.040]  attacked by the media he went into a fortress mode that's right although I'm
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:41.840]  not sure Bannon has the full credentials to do that you know he really
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:47.080]  needs to sit down with you and me and Dr. Chuck Baldwin or other people who
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:51.120]  really understand what's going on who can brief him in a credible way now we're
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:55.240]  not bragging we literally you and others your uncle created your uncle
[2:13:55.240 --> 2:13:58.520]  created the modern resistance movement I mean so we're not just shooting our
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:03.040]  mouths off we have the people they have us we're together in fighting our hearts
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:06.200]  out here and we literally want to help the president we want to restore the
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:10.200]  Republic and even UKIP said half their members are from info wars and then as
[2:14:10.200 --> 2:14:12.840]  soon as they get into power it's like we don't even exist we don't want power
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:16.960]  we're not in Washington we want to be as far away from as possible but they the
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:21.720]  president needs to energize and work with us and understand that well that's
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:25.080]  right and unfortunately once your president you get so overwhelmed with
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:30.040]  briefings and your schedule gets so full that it's very difficult to get in a
[2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:35.560]  word in edge wise not on purpose that's done on purpose you're right and you
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:41.480]  know the president is a little bit upset with Ryan's previous for man handling
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:45.880]  this health care thing and not getting the right people to him previous kept
[2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:50.320]  Rand Paul away from Donald Trump Donald Trump never even read the health care
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:55.200]  bill he simply took what the republicans have put together I lied to him
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:59.440]  that's right he said this is the plan that you want he went with it but he
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:04.840]  never read it and I think he's been stung enough that after talking with
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:10.320]  Rand Paul he probably will start to dig into this he does sleep very little he
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:14.040]  does spend a lot of early morning hours watching the internet and other things
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:22.520]  and if by some act of God we could get some access you know I think Donald
[2:15:22.520 --> 2:15:25.080]  Trump has a good heart sure you and others have reached out instead of you
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:28.680]  talk to Trump telling this half the time I've missed the calls and other ones
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:33.600]  early on calls are like 15 minutes long we really talk now it's like Alex a lot
[2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:36.760]  of folks watching he knows he's everything he's saying is being recorded
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:40.640]  keep it up great job how's the family just keep it up you know you know I'm
[2:15:40.640 --> 2:15:44.680]  delivering are you happy it's mainly a pat on the head and I get that but then
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:46.600]  I thought folks that have to go have private meetings with him and he's
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:50.400]  literally just like yeah and I can't get into it but I mean Trump really does
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:53.880]  want to take on the globalist but he's so surrounded and he's lied to by
[2:15:53.880 --> 2:15:57.480]  everybody and I'm not just lionizing him and giving me excuses it's they
[2:15:57.480 --> 2:16:00.920]  literally lie to his face and then go to the opposite he's just surrounded by
[2:16:00.920 --> 2:16:06.880]  by a bunch of cowards that are too too weak to be strong well he is a good
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.440]  person but he isn't you know one man can't run the huge business like the
[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:14.560]  United States government is you've really got to have a large team and
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:17.600]  unfortunately we don't have a lot of people in our side of the movement have
[2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:21.280]  a lot of experience in government because they're blacklisted they cannot get
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:25.440]  jobs in government and they cannot deal with the evil and the bureaucracy once
[2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:28.760]  they're in exactly they don't let us anywhere near anything of course you
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:32.000]  live one of the major movements with Reagan to try to restore things that got
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:35.520]  blocked that's right I was chairman of the conservative
[2:16:35.520 --> 2:16:40.520]  national committee in the 1980s trying to stop the Reagan compromise and it was
[2:16:40.520 --> 2:16:46.160]  amazing how much opposition we got from Republicans it was the liberal
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:50.280]  Republicans that did not want us to influence Reagan and Reagan had a good
[2:16:50.280 --> 2:16:54.640]  heart but he was influenced by George H. W. Bush who was sent in there forced
[2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:58.600]  upon Reagan in order to control his administration to give a power over the
[2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:02.600]  entire bureaucracy of government so that he controlled who was hired but
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:07.040]  regardless we've seen a major wounding have we not of the global agenda
[2:17:07.040 --> 2:17:12.760]  wherever Trump goes we're back in the fight now well absolutely but the
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:16.840]  retaliation of the globalist is powerful for example they are undermining the
[2:17:16.840 --> 2:17:20.600]  Brexit in ways that you wouldn't realize look at what let me tell you they are
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:24.520]  all over us with Intel I can't believe they are just kidding us I'm from every
[2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:30.880]  angle financially now but Theresa May inculcated all inculcated all EU law into
[2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:35.320]  British law and then said now we'll just pick and choose and remove what we want
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:38.980]  you know it's it's 10 times as hard to remove a law that has a benefit
[2:17:38.980 --> 2:17:42.280]  corrupted majority supporting it once it's in it would have been much better
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:46.920]  to simply cut the breakfast off and just say we'll start from scratch it will
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:50.200]  take in what we want you're gonna get all the technicals off you let's take a
[2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:53.200]  few calls with Joe Scals and we're gonna edit this down last 20 minutes like a
[2:17:53.200 --> 2:17:56.280]  10-minute message to you to the president I think that's important and
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:17:59.200]  everybody youtubers everybody share your message to the president you got a very
[2:17:59.200 --> 2:18:03.000]  good chance of him saying it they won't let you you know get up at the top of
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:07.200]  his Twitter feed now they know he needs the feedback he listens to you it's not
[2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:10.800]  that I'm that special Trump calls hundreds and hundreds of people a week
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:14.760]  that are just in the Liberty Movement I mean it's amazing he really does one
[2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:18.840]  interface with the people that's something he does his dad did it so it's
[2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:21.440]  not that even that big a deal the president calls me sometimes though when
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:24.920]  I missed the call I get really upset let's go ahead and go to John in Texas
[2:18:24.920 --> 2:18:30.240]  John thanks for holding her on the air hi Alex the first thing they need to do
[2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:34.160]  before they start a war with North Korea is like you said they need to go after
[2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:37.800]  these people that transferred all the technology there they need to go after
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:41.640]  the ones that transfer the technology that taught China because the Chinese
[2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:44.840]  will not have the military they have today without these free trade agreements
[2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:50.200]  I totally agree Joel I mean is it not high treason that the Clintons but also
[2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:52.800]  some Republicans transferred everything to China and now North Korea that's
[2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:57.040]  insane yes it was done mostly through the Commerce Department it happened
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:00.920]  during the Clinton years it happened during the Bush years it never stopped
[2:19:00.920 --> 2:19:06.680]  in fact Condoleezza Rice was nearly indicted for being involved in a spy
[2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:12.080]  scandal with the Chinese why would you sell ICBM and cruise missile technology
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:15.480]  to your number one enemy what the hell are these people excuse me Lord I'm sorry
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:19.960]  I just I'm so angry at these people well it's just like Henry Kissinger talking
[2:19:19.960 --> 2:19:24.320]  Richard Nixon into giving the miniature ball bearing technology to Russia so
[2:19:24.320 --> 2:19:27.920]  they can move their missiles they didn't have independent warheads until we gave
[2:19:27.920 --> 2:19:31.440]  them the miniature ball bearing technology and why do they do that
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:35.000]  because they are building the best enemies that money can buy they want
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:41.200]  this war they want this America attacked they don't tend to lose the war but
[2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:44.800]  they do intend to absorb a nuclear first bike and Donald Trump needs to know that
[2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:49.120]  unless he gets trapped into this if he starts a war without understanding what's
[2:19:49.120 --> 2:19:53.440]  gonna happen I can tell you you know he can authorize a nuclear retaliation but
[2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:56.040]  I can tell you those codes aren't gonna get to the state there I want to talk

[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:05.400]  about and I've got all the scenarios here and I've read about them and watched
[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:10.280]  it how easy a nuclear war can start North Korea fires a missile or they or the
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:13.600]  US knows they're loading an atomic sonnet or maybe so they blow them up on the
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:18.840]  launch pad then the North starts attacking South Korea and a war starts and
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:21.480]  then the military is gonna say hit them with the tactical nuclear weapons to stop
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:27.000]  them coming across or China may launch nukes or North Korea might then launch
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:30.800]  one on Seoul I mean it just goes everywhere and all some little crazy
[2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:36.720]  fat man who's the just the image of a wimpy dictator it's it's ridiculous what
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:40.320]  a poster child for big government communism but let's go to John in New
[2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:43.640]  York another John John you're on here with Joe Scowze and the editor at
[2:25:43.640 --> 2:25:47.880]  worldoffirstbrief.com go ahead all right Alex first of all thanks for
[2:25:47.880 --> 2:25:51.800]  everything you do I wanted to say anyone who's more interested in evidence
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:56.920]  that the global elites have interest in turning over US interest in China should
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:01.320]  look at WikiLeaks email number 23730 in which Clinton wants to discuss turning
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:06.000]  over Taiwan to China in order to curry favor with the Chinese but Taiwan a lot
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:09.200]  of people don't know it was modeled after the US it was the original
[2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:13.600]  government of China before it was kicked out by the commune so for Clinton to do
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:18.280]  that would basically turn over the entire South China Sea to communist
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:24.200]  dictator that's a great point Joe Scowze and we're we're putting that the
[2:26:24.200 --> 2:26:29.240]  WikiLeaks up there well the remember that the globalists have been doing this
[2:26:29.240 --> 2:26:35.080]  ever since the beginning when they in 1949 allowed Mao Zedong to take over
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:39.800]  China by cutting off military aid to Chiang Kai-shek who fled of course to
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:45.920]  Formosa which now has become Taiwan so the globalist under Henry Kissinger
[2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:51.360]  gave away free China let them be replaced at the United Nations with red
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:55.440]  Chinese gave them a seat on the Security Council this is part of the effort of
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:00.320]  building an enemy a future enemy it's not an indication that the globalist are
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:04.960]  in bed with China in a knowing relationship it is a one-way street it is
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:10.160]  globalist giving to China China only playing as if they're part of the
[2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:14.560]  free market playing as if they might be friendly or something but it's literally
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:19.160]  a one-way street sure both sides are exploiting each other and the West is
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:24.480]  exploiting all the slave labor in China but it is not joint collaboration as if
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:28.320]  the globalist owned China or Russia these are still separate predator powers
[2:27:28.320 --> 2:27:32.820]  John that's a great point you raised though that our so-called elites
[2:27:32.820 --> 2:27:37.200]  Hillary is just so ready to sell out whole regions whole countries whole
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:41.640]  systems of these people it's sick of anything else John well I just want to
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:44.920]  say that the people of Taiwan I go there frequently and they love Trump because
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:48.800]  he's the first president to talk to the president of Taiwan in 30 years we've got
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:52.800]  a lot of support over there we can't let these people down well I just know this
[2:27:52.800 --> 2:27:57.480]  I mean we have we have true communist evil in China expanding and our media
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:01.000]  never says a word about but then wants to have war with Russia constantly let's
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.840]  take another call thank you John we're gonna go to North Carolina now and talk
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:07.560]  to Chris Chris in North Carolina you're on the air with Joe Scow so go ahead
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:12.040]  thank you for taking my call and thank you guys for all that you do I know you
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:16.240]  don't like the thanks but I just want to die a nuclear war I want my kids to live
[2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:21.040]  but yes sir thank you thank you for what you do Chris and I definitely believe
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.560]  it's gonna come from North Korea I mean you can be you can see it being set up
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:32.580]  playing this day and I want to let you guys know that I watched strategic
[2:28:32.580 --> 2:28:38.400]  relocation by Joel I think it was about maybe two or three years ago and I lived
[2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:45.280]  in a major city and I got the heck out of the city now live in rural area and
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:51.440]  it's because of my majority always knew that something was coming and I know
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:56.160]  it's coming a lot faster than what we probably expect I was about to say by
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:28:59.640]  instinct says get away away from populated centers so that's that's a
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:08.360]  great point I think John is definitely correct about you know what I think
[2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:13.320]  they're gonna do is they're gonna put Trump in a situation where you know
[2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:16.720]  something will happen and then they'll end up blaming it on him just like the
[2:29:16.720 --> 2:29:21.440]  blame and everything else on him I quickly say I'm a black male first time
[2:29:21.440 --> 2:29:25.680]  voting I mean in my early 40s I just voted for the first time I voted for
[2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:30.160]  Trump because I think he's got the right intentions I think he knows what
[2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:33.880]  what he knows what's going on but I don't think he understands the total depth
[2:29:33.880 --> 2:29:37.680]  of this thing Chris it's good to have you on board God bless you we're out of
[2:29:37.680 --> 2:29:41.720]  time I'm gonna come back and get Joel's comment on your great points absolutely
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:44.560]  that's what the globalist hate Trump so much we're gonna come back with Joel's
[2:29:44.560 --> 2:29:47.760]  response more calls and then talk about how this war could be triggered and then
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:54.400]  what would happen we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[2:29:54.400 --> 2:29:57.840]  GCN radio network
[2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:05.760]  the United States is rapidly and dangerously moving towards a war with
[2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:11.280]  North Korea retired four-star general Jack King who turned down President
[2:30:11.280 --> 2:30:16.120]  Donald Trump's offer to be Secretary of Defense says a preemptive strike on
[2:30:16.120 --> 2:30:21.400]  North Korea's nuclear facilities might be the only option we have left to stop
[2:30:21.400 --> 2:30:26.480]  them from developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the US White House
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:31.480]  National Security Advisor Katie McFarlane says if it fails to put pressure
[2:30:31.480 --> 2:30:37.120]  on North Korea to disable its nuclear program there is a real possibility
[2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:42.440]  that North Korea will be able to hit the US with a nuclear armed missile by the
[2:30:42.440 --> 2:30:48.880]  end of Trump's first term as president meanwhile China has vowed to defend its
[2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:55.320]  territory at all costs if the US launches a military attack against North

[2:32:27.040 --> 2:32:31.080]  ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that everyone knew
[2:32:31.080 --> 2:32:34.720]  that you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the
[2:32:34.720 --> 2:32:39.720]  fat for cooking but you use the bones for strength for the outside structure
[2:32:39.720 --> 2:32:43.320]  full of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the

[2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:52.000]  my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:55.080]  made us what we were and this is a big part of it I know you're gonna want to

[2:33:26.040 --> 2:33:39.400]  teach him he can trust me like a brother one day we'll settle up and right
[2:33:39.400 --> 2:33:49.480]  and we're gonna ride. Alright final segment with Joel Scowles and taking a few phone calls here
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:57.760]  but the last caller brought up why the elite hate Trump so much so Scowles and
[2:33:57.760 --> 2:34:01.080]  in your gut do you think they'll try to kill Trump or just try to wind up some
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:04.920]  crazy to do it hope all their anti-trump hype does it I mean don't they
[2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:09.400]  don't they endanger themselves turning them into a martyr but then if you pull
[2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:14.440]  back they're just already so panic he's in the office that it seems like they're
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:17.760]  not worried about what might come they just want that victory over the
[2:34:17.760 --> 2:34:22.880]  nationalists now well the danger they run in doing an assassination is a
[2:34:22.880 --> 2:34:27.040]  temperature always leaves a lot of trails like the JFK assassination it
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:31.680]  creates a tremendous body of evidence for conspiracy and they're reluctant to
[2:34:31.680 --> 2:34:36.040]  do that I mean I'm 11 boosted the conspiracy community by 30 or 40 or
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:40.200]  50% just because of all the tracks government left and pulling off that
[2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:44.840]  false flag operation so I think that's doubtful especially as they're being
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:50.080]  able to control him so successfully on foreign policy I mean as typical you know
[2:34:50.080 --> 2:34:53.800]  like happened yesterday when he came out railing against Assad that means he
[2:34:53.800 --> 2:34:56.880]  bought into the chemical weapons attack even though none of the mainstream
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:00.840]  media actually said it was proven that was a saw because it can't be proven it
[2:35:00.840 --> 2:35:06.120]  wasn't him it was the rebels so I think they're going to I think it's most
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:10.240]  likely they're going to try to continue to discredit him while they control him
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:14.880]  in foreign policy so that it can't be a real reelected but talking about North
[2:35:14.880 --> 2:35:18.440]  Korea I think there is a very real possibility that that scenario is true
[2:35:18.440 --> 2:35:23.800]  that they will try to precipitate this strike before the end of the Trump
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:29.280]  administration so that they blame him on it and that's why that's right they're
[2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:34.040]  on the news saying what's happening now is Trump's fault it's North Korea it's
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:37.840]  the Clintons giving him the weapons anyone informed it's like laughable to
[2:35:37.840 --> 2:35:41.680]  blame Trump it's just insane breaking news I don't know about this decision
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:45.480]  he's obviously better than Obama or somebody Rick Perry's got great
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:49.680]  rhetoric so again it shows how Trump wants to be a patriot but then Rick
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:53.600]  Perry only became mr. Tea Party when we made him Rick Perry statesman is
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:58.160]  reporting added the National Security Council's core decision makers Rick Perry
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:36:03.040]  former Texas governor and added to the National Security Council that is the
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:09.600]  most that is cockamamie I'm a little worried about that because Rick Perry
[2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:13.680]  has been an unstable voice for the conservative community he's been all
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:17.400]  over the map and he has followed some globalist agendas when it came to that
[2:36:17.400 --> 2:36:23.000]  NAFTA corridor in any he's gone to Bilderberg yeah he's gone to Bilderberg
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:28.960]  so look anybody that McMaster allows to be on the National Security Council is
[2:36:28.960 --> 2:36:32.600]  going to be safe I was about to say that means I see Perry as a lapdog
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:36.920]  former Democrat he's just a yes man only he's a bad person I know him I think
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:42.760]  they put a lapdog on there but he's not particularly smart either and that's so
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:46.600]  those kinds of people are manipulable the point your last caller brought up
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:50.480]  though is very important about how much he learned from strategic relocation
[2:36:50.480 --> 2:36:53.280]  about getting out of the big cities if you're in the big cities when this
[2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:56.920]  nuclear war comes not that big cities are going to be targeted first they're
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:37:00.880]  not but there will be an EMP strike that hits and there's going to be a
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:04.480]  tremendous amount of chaos and social unrest people need to have alternatives
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:09.680]  for getting out of the big cities or retreats or arrangements with families
[2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:14.160]  who live in more rural areas you know Alex and I did a video on securing your
[2:37:14.160 --> 2:37:18.360]  home it hasn't been released yet it's going to be done shortly but we're
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:24.280]  giving real prime information to all you people on how to develop inexpensively a
[2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:29.960]  fallout and safety shelter in your own home that can be done quite economically
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:33.560]  so you don't have to be held hostage by the threat of nuclear war there's
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:38.120]  actually something that you can do Wow okay I want to go a few calls here in
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:41.600]  closing but spend a few minutes on how the war could be triggered there's three
[2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:45.000]  or four different scenarios I know main scenarios but you're a former Marine
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:48.160]  Corps officer fighter bomber pilot yeah that's predicted really studied this
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:52.840]  particularly this trigger for World War three you know we probably put on screen
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:56.800]  just a map of the Korean Peninsula the South China Sea but China projecting its
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:37:59.600]  power very belligerently breaking deals that happen the Anglo-American
[2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:03.360]  establishment to be dominant economic force but not military they're breaking
[2:38:03.360 --> 2:38:06.080]  with that why are they breaking with it and then let's talk about the triggers
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:09.080]  how this would go because I mean even mainstream news says this could easily
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:14.720]  escalate to nuclear war in a matter of minutes yes the main principle from a
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:18.800]  military standpoint and what North Korea is prepared for for years is a mass
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:24.400]  invasion across the peninsula into the south and shelling of Seoul to which the
[2:38:24.400 --> 2:38:28.760]  United States military could only stop because it's 2 million men versus 50
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:32.920]  thousand men you can only stop that with tactical nuclear weapons that would
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:38.160]  trigger a nuclear war but the more likely scenario now Alex is that Kim Yong-un
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:43.360]  makes good on his threat and launches a missile at Hawaii now that said remember
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:46.880]  that Kim Yong-un does not have maneuvering warheads like the Chinese
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:52.000]  and the Russians his missile would be easy to track easy to shoot down and US
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:56.880]  naval vessels with the ages anti-missile system would easily shoot down the
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:02.720]  missile now that's right so at that point when it's shot down I don't care
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:06.600]  if it comes over the pole towards the east coast or I think they'll try for
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:11.360]  something in Hawaii because remember North Korea does not has never tested a
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:15.760]  nuclear weapon to a target where you get a circular air probable they don't know
[2:39:15.760 --> 2:39:21.240]  how accurate their missiles are yet and so it but in any case it's going to be
[2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:27.800]  shot down by the West and then the West has a decision we really need to they'll
[2:39:27.800 --> 2:39:31.680]  say you know take out their nuclear capacity because they've threatened us
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:35.960]  now if they did that could trigger a nuclear war if they did retaliate and
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:39.160]  take out their missile sites as well as their nuclear and we've got the
[2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:43.080]  Secretary of State generals all saying the only option might be hitting the
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:47.480]  sites they're going right to just annihilating the sites right now because
[2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:52.640]  Kim Jong-un is threatening to blow up a seol in Tokyo so I don't think that'll
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:57.240]  happen Alex I don't think they'll move first I think the US is confidence in
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:40:00.280]  their ability to shoot down a missile so they're gonna wait to see if you can
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:03.080]  give me on moon the globalists don't want to appear to be the aggressors
[2:40:03.080 --> 2:40:08.200]  they've got to appear the victims in this next war and they can do so and why
[2:40:08.200 --> 2:40:11.920]  is North Korea exactly playing along with that I get China once the plausible
[2:40:11.920 --> 2:40:14.960]  liability of the war happens but that that's a two-way street and it seems
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:19.400]  like it cuts harder on the other side of of them being the aggressor everybody
[2:40:19.400 --> 2:40:27.440]  knows that that that's their pet pet pet pig Kim Jong-un yeah well he has whipped
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:31.040]  up his troops to a frenzy every year and speeches for them telling me we're
[2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:34.480]  going to attack that is imminent he's got to keep doing something I mean this
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:38.960]  guy is not stable this guy is a juvenile mind it's just why don't their
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:41.800]  elites who I mean oh China runs the North Korea but how do they do that I
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:45.960]  don't all the research goes into it why hasn't their elite killed him reformed
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:51.200]  merged with South Korea why do they want to be communist well remember they
[2:40:51.200 --> 2:40:57.040]  want Kim Jong-un to have a crazy man to start the war I mean China wants need
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:00.240]  someone to start the war so that they can't be blamed on us so the Russia
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:03.360]  can't be blamed on they've got every motive in the world to keep Kim Jong-un
[2:41:03.360 --> 2:41:10.240]  and every other wireheaded kid in office if he should die and China controls
[2:41:10.240 --> 2:41:14.200]  Kim Jong-un mostly through controlling the military the military is controlled
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:18.400]  by Chinese generals they don't make a move without consulting with red China so
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:23.280]  I think that situation is not going to change but Kim Jong-un thinks he's in
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:28.600]  charge that's what's dangerous he can launch a missile and start a war and you
[2:41:28.600 --> 2:41:32.800]  know he attacks South Korea at least once a year whether it's attacking a
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:37.880]  patrol board or shelling an island that's all provocation but I think things
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:40.360]  are heating up and they're getting serious we need to watch this very
[2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:48.440]  closely all right well dr. dr. Paul Craig Roberts is gonna be coming on soon
[2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:51.920]  to give us his take I want to get him on about this also want to get Ron Paul
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:56.760]  Dr. Ron Paul on cover all this Joel Scowles in World Affairs brief I got a
[2:41:56.760 --> 2:41:59.160]  lot of their calls here but I know you've got to go and I've got Millie about
[2:41:59.160 --> 2:42:02.720]  the pop-ins we'll talk to you soon I'll go to Sam and Jason and Bruce and Dan
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:05.960]  and Ken everybody after I finished talking to Millie but thank you so much
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:11.840]  Phil Scowles pleasure to be with you Alex goodbye now thank you yeah it's I
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:19.920]  just have children and the spectacle of that demon creature Kim Jong-un and then
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:24.800]  I watched the photos and videos of his his minions even the ones that are
[2:42:24.800 --> 2:42:32.640]  supposedly elite and they are the most crazy-eyed skinny starving clowns in
[2:42:32.640 --> 2:42:39.520]  their ridiculous monkey suits feeding on people but then I look at polo scene
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:44.160]  everybody and I see how in a few generations from her you'd have something
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:50.840]  even worse here and I asked well then who am I if I'm ruled by these lazy
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:54.720]  hateful evil people I can't laugh at North Koreans I certainly don't laugh I
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:42:58.000]  cry for them and I spent like at 30 minutes this morning just looking at
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:03.720]  photos and videos of North Koreans that's the stuff they let you see it was
[2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:06.920]  very haunting photo I talked about it earlier
[2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:13.720]  it's in a CNN story yeah it was Rex Tillerson's incredibly odd and confusing
[2:43:13.720 --> 2:43:21.360]  statement on North Korea and it shows Kim Jong-un standing there with tank
[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:30.840]  cruise and when you blow it up and look at their faces each one of their faces I
[2:43:30.840 --> 2:43:36.840]  mean they believe they're the good guys they believe that there is this evil
[2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:43.200]  enemy that they're up against they are on another planet man they are beyond any
[2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:53.360]  cult you've ever seen and it's like it's what Hollywood is though where the
[2:43:53.360 --> 2:43:57.240]  media holds up this star or this person they may be a great actor they may be
[2:43:57.240 --> 2:44:01.560]  really beautiful woman handsome man but still it's sick to sit there just praise
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:06.320]  them for the so-called position they're in and then you look at that place where
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:15.720]  the celebrity is him and fawning women rushing up like he's Elvis Presley is
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:20.480]  grabbing him and throwing themselves at him and it's so sincere because they're
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:27.120]  in such a cult and then he thinks Dennis Rodman's cool had been cool in 20 years
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:32.520]  and that's never was cool and that's the only celebrity he can get to go watch a
[2:44:32.520 --> 2:44:36.360]  basketball game where he sits there on state-run TV and says the great Dennis
[2:44:36.360 --> 2:44:41.200]  Rodman is here to hear me and it's just like all a joke the whole universe is
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:48.080]  around us and so much possibility look how far humanity's already come and I
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:56.520]  just think about what we're ruled by and it just makes me ask why because our
[2:44:56.520 --> 2:45:01.160]  weakness is what has allowed that type of weakness to be in charge of things and
[2:45:01.160 --> 2:45:05.440]  I think about Democrats celebrating nuclear war and a rooting for North
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:09.680]  Korea and all their weird crap and just rooting the economy implode and then
[2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:13.800]  just you just like why
[2:45:19.160 --> 2:45:28.880]  why why does it have to happen like that and so we just got to do better but you
[2:45:28.880 --> 2:45:32.120]  look at the strange cult-like control they have in communist China and
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:38.160]  communist North Korea and they're such hellholes why does every trendy push
[2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:43.160]  communism is some unrealized utopia some some dream
[2:45:46.080 --> 2:45:54.600]  look at these photos of the generals and just just everyone else it's just
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:46:03.600]  totally and completely ridiculous let's go to Millie we were just with a quick pop
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:07.120]  report because they're they're just out there in California to do detailed
[2:46:07.120 --> 2:46:10.880]  reports on a lot of bombshell stuff I don't want her just come on live on the
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:15.440]  show distract from what her and Gavin and Michael Zimmerman everybody are
[2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:21.960]  doing on the team but Millie what's the latest information from California in
[2:46:21.960 --> 2:46:28.360]  our investigation of the elites pension for child traveling well hi Alex so far
[2:46:28.360 --> 2:46:33.800]  today this morning we met with the founder of children of the night Dr.
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:40.200]  Lois Lee and it was actually pretty amazing because we went to their center
[2:46:40.200 --> 2:46:46.920]  and they actually had young girls and boys living there at the center in like
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:51.520]  little dorms and they had little bad schools they had all kinds of nice
[2:46:51.520 --> 2:46:55.920]  programs and things so we actually had some of these children give us a tour
[2:46:55.920 --> 2:47:01.720]  around the facility so that was actually a shock I mean you're actually you're
[2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:06.240]  actually now interfacing with children that have been trafficked yeah I mean
[2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:13.400]  these were as far as I could see maybe the youngest while ish but I talked to
[2:47:13.400 --> 2:47:19.560]  Dr. Lois Lee and she said that she's rescued sexually exploited children as
[2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:25.640]  young as eight years old so they they do come pretty young sure and that's
[2:47:25.640 --> 2:47:28.640]  because they're able to speak out by it by that a lot of times they just get
[2:47:28.640 --> 2:47:33.200]  killed in the even darker stuff or they get so programmed by it that they
[2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:38.040]  just accept it never speak out well what it seems to be is like there's
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:43.720]  different elements there's different vicinity of the trafficking so what it
[2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:48.120]  seems to be is like the children of the night seems to work with kids that are
[2:47:48.120 --> 2:47:53.640]  on the street from poor families poor areas where their parents are into drugs
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:57.400]  and it's an abusive environment where they're being molested at home or
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:01.920]  raped at home by family members or by drug dealers so their mom can get drug
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:07.280]  and then they end up running off to the street and then they get picked up by
[2:48:07.280 --> 2:48:13.000]  these traffickers or pimps who then it prostitutes them but what's very
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:18.040]  interesting here is that what seem to be is that the the children are not as
[2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:22.480]  popular amongst your average everyday John's like your average Americans are
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:27.720]  looking for prostitution but what we are of course of course 99.9% don't yeah go
[2:48:27.720 --> 2:48:32.760]  ahead sorry yes but what we're finding is that the young children the pedophile
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:38.920]  stuff is very popular amongst the elite circle and that's what is kind of
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:42.440]  interesting to see is that you're of course the general public's not it's
[2:48:42.440 --> 2:48:45.680]  very rare the general public that it's just an elite taste that's documented
[2:48:45.680 --> 2:48:50.600]  yes yes so that's what we're finding and I don't want to give too much away but
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:54.800]  we're speaking with somebody that has worked for various intelligence agencies
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:49:01.520]  and it has information that is regarding a travel club that is linked to thousands
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:05.660]  of children that have gone missing majority of them from Native American
[2:49:05.660 --> 2:49:10.760]  reservations so we're gonna be coming out with that stuff too later on in our
[2:49:10.760 --> 2:49:14.120]  investigation but I don't want to reveal too much exactly well you know up in
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:16.840]  Canada that was the case has been confirmed where they were traveling
[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:23.840]  that's that's part of it and it's linked to some of these travel clubs where we
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:28.360]  have serial killers and and murderers that do this stuff on behalf of the
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:34.360]  travel club and that's kind of where this ties in to the dark web and that's
[2:49:34.360 --> 2:49:38.480]  what we're on our way right now to go sure there's a lot of travel clubs that
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:42.400]  go to Haiti and that's one of their big things is sex tourism and Dominican
[2:49:42.400 --> 2:49:47.960]  Republic pedophilia it's just unbelievable exactly so you do find the
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:54.560]  pedophilia amongst just your average day street kids but it is a lot more
[2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:59.360]  prevalent amongst the elite circles and that I think speaks volumes that we have
[2:49:59.360 --> 2:50:04.480]  these elite people in powerful positions that are actually more into hurting
[2:50:04.480 --> 2:50:09.640]  these little kids whereas it's not as common although it is it definitely is
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:13.080]  well sure and I love how media tries to act like this is even going on with the
[2:50:13.080 --> 2:50:17.120]  Catholic Church in Penn State and you gotta ask yourself why is MSM doing
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:21.800]  that because they're sexualizing children Viacom's famous for it they are
[2:50:21.800 --> 2:50:25.040]  trying to normalize this that they want our children this is what the elite want
[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:30.960]  and because it's evil if they can get us to sexualize our children we'll accept
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:38.160]  anything yes and some of these stories are absolutely disturbing and they make
[2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:41.920]  you just stick to your stomach I mean there what's going on on the deep web
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:47.360]  right now is pretty I mean it's pretty gruesome where I've told you I don't

[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:53.880]  where I actually am a wimp I've investigated it I've talked to the
[2:56:53.880 --> 2:56:59.200]  police I've seen the articles it gets under my skin and it makes me angry on
[2:56:59.200 --> 2:57:02.480]  a primitive level so I know it's probably rough for you guys what is it
[2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:05.760]  like being out there meet with law enforcement going to these orphanages
[2:57:05.760 --> 2:57:10.960]  seeing the facts for yourself what's it like well it's pretty sad it's pretty
[2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:15.920]  heartbreaking definitely when I went and saw all those young kids there it was
[2:57:15.920 --> 2:57:20.280]  like wow you know I can't believe it's just crazy to see faces you know to
[2:57:20.280 --> 2:57:24.760]  actually see the people that are being affected by the children that are
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:28.520]  being affected by this and so that to me was like really shocking because I
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:33.160]  wasn't really prepared for that but you know some of the stories even that we've
[2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:37.320]  been hearing having to investigate this about the dark web are pretty you know
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:40.840]  they're pretty like they make you they make your stomachs just feel sick they
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:45.160]  make you just want to like oh I don't even know how to explain it it's just
[2:57:45.160 --> 2:57:48.960]  completely makes you sick to your stomach to hear some of the stuff that's going
[2:57:48.960 --> 2:57:53.440]  on out there makes me even sicker is then to see media making jokes about it
[2:57:53.440 --> 2:58:00.840]  or salon pushing pedophilia yeah I mean that's you how you had these like groups
[2:58:00.840 --> 2:58:05.520]  like that verb head group where they're saying they're virtuous pedophiles and
[2:58:05.520 --> 2:58:09.520]  at the same time it's like well I don't really see I mean I know they're saying
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:13.160]  they're not going out and committing the crimes well we don't know if that's
[2:58:13.160 --> 2:58:18.240]  necessarily true but at the same time if somebody is saying they're a virtuous
[2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:22.240]  pedophile I don't think that they should be trusted around children or have those
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:27.800]  rights to be a school teacher or any type of a sort of figure around children
[2:58:27.800 --> 2:58:31.520]  because that means that there's a risk associated all right Mellie we're

[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:07.560]  on its lies it ends us having a good relationship with Russia which we need
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:11.560]  just from an economic perspective it's another nationalist country it's got way
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:15.760]  more resources than we do we should be absolutely working with Russia and then
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:19.640]  they say I'm a Russian agent because I say that this is an incredible time to

[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:42.560]  because my my mother's people are Hungarian my mother's people were crushed
[3:01:42.560 --> 3:01:49.800]  on the streets of Budapest in 1956 so don't tell me about Russians you're
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:55.240]  exactly right it's hard to keep up with the news that picture you showed of the
[3:01:55.240 --> 3:02:00.000]  North Korean tyrant with his generals look carefully at the pictures of those
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:05.400]  generals notice how all their sleeves are too long that's the worst tailoring
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:12.680]  I've ever seen we are at the brink clearly of a national or I should say
[3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:16.760]  an international upheaval that's a good point though communists can't even
[3:02:16.760 --> 3:02:20.720]  produce clothes I could make a better suit than that yeah no their sleeves are
[3:02:20.720 --> 3:02:26.880]  always too long it is a sign of Chinese tailoring they must be sending to China
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:32.320]  to have their uniforms made wholesale here's I think the real point which is
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:38.800]  very much like Ronald Reagan the North Koreans the Chinese are about to find out
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:43.880]  out that Donald Trump is not a cream puff he is not a pushover like Jimmy
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:52.000]  Carter or Bill Clinton or Barack Obama he's tough as nails perhaps the toughest
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:58.680]  man I've ever met and there is ice water in his veins when he is on the attack
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:04.000]  and he's standing up for something he believes in so they they're about to
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:09.480]  confront an international leader who's unlike anyone they've ever dealt with
[3:03:09.480 --> 3:03:16.680]  before the ass kissing and the and the and the appeasement of our
[3:03:16.680 --> 3:03:21.520]  international foes those days are over my friend and that's why all the special
[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:25.400]  owners are so mad they're saying Trump's a pushover and controlled by
[3:03:25.400 --> 3:03:29.080]  foreigners because he's the only president and forever that actually isn't
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:34.600]  controlled by foreigners well in big news today carried by real clear politics
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:39.640]  congressman Adam Schiff of California now admits that there is no evidence of
[3:03:39.640 --> 3:03:46.400]  Russian collusion it's about time he has made specific accusations about me that
[3:03:46.400 --> 3:03:51.360]  you know I am itching to respond to and so the house of cards is coming down they
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:55.240]  now admit Susan Rice did he legally spy other people did it I mean that as you
[3:03:55.240 --> 3:04:00.000]  said a month ago or more this is the new Watergate well and the leftist said
[3:04:00.000 --> 3:04:03.960]  repeatedly somebody's gonna go to jail somebody's gonna go to jail in this
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:07.800]  whole Russia thing they're absolutely right some people are going to go to
[3:04:07.800 --> 3:04:13.680]  jail but they're the frontline of Barack Obama's advisors and retainers who
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:18.680]  clearly were utilizing national surveillance information intel
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:24.760]  information for strictly political purposes and that's a big no-no as you
[3:04:24.760 --> 3:04:29.080]  know well what else is coming up as I turn the baton over to you my friend well
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:34.440]  I want to talk about Steve Bannon and the shift of power the internal struggle
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:38.920]  in the White House as you know we foreshadowed all of this yesterday with
[3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:44.680]  our discussion of Jared Kushner's text message channel to Joe Scarborough so
[3:04:44.680 --> 3:04:47.680]  we're gonna get back into that in just a few minutes and by the way our
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:51.680]  interview yesterday's big news that's in hundreds of newspapers and Roger Jones
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:04:55.600]  about to make a lot more news he's got more details on that whole Kushner
[3:04:55.600 --> 3:04:59.720]  situation with the folks over at Scarborough country
[3:04:59.720 --> 3:05:04.280]  tensions are high border wall contractors braced for a hostile environment
[3:05:04.280 --> 3:05:07.920]  one potential bidder on President Donald Trump's border wall wanted to know if
[3:05:07.920 --> 3:05:11.840]  authorities would rush to help if workers came under hostile attack another
[3:05:11.840 --> 3:05:15.760]  asked if employees can carry firearms and states with strict gun control laws
[3:05:15.760 --> 3:05:20.480]  and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force with bids do
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:24.520]  Tuesday on the first design contracts interesting companies are preparing for
[3:05:24.520 --> 3:05:28.160]  the worst if they get the potentially lucrative job a US official with
[3:05:28.160 --> 3:05:32.160]  knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity said four to ten
[3:05:32.160 --> 3:05:35.880]  bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes they will be
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:40.040]  constructed on a roughly quarter mile 400 meter strip of federally owned land
[3:05:40.040 --> 3:05:44.840]  in San Diego within 120 feet of the border though a final decision has not
[3:05:44.840 --> 3:05:49.640]  been made on the precise spot Democrats vow to oppose any wall funding and many
[3:05:49.640 --> 3:05:53.760]  Republicans are also wary of this plan for a massive brick-and-mortar barrier

[3:08:45.720 --> 3:08:49.800]  like the peppermint this would be particularly good for children although
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:57.840]  my granddaughter is a grown and anyone who understands you know oral health
[3:08:57.840 --> 3:09:04.120]  understands that gum health is directly tied to both heart disease and heart

[3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:16.800]  certain health benefits as well if you've ever seen a photograph of Mrs.

[3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:40.720]  battle with Google and Facebook and those who would cut off our oxygen please do
[3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:46.680]  yourself a favor go to the info wars.com store and load up on the super
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:52.760]  blue fluoride toothpaste now available in bubble gum flavor this is a terrific
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:58.600]  product the folks at info wars know I won't plug anything that I don't believe
[3:09:58.600 --> 3:10:05.400]  in and the folks in my family swear by this product yesterday here on info
[3:10:05.400 --> 3:10:13.000]  wars.com we revealed a back channel by text between the president's son-in-law
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:21.320]  Jared Kushner and the rabid anti-Trump television commentator and former
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:28.240]  congressman Joe Scarborough and my sources tell me that a number of the
[3:10:28.240 --> 3:10:34.880]  negative attacks by Scarborough on presidential assistant Steve Bannon have
[3:10:34.880 --> 3:10:41.920]  been orchestrated and manipulated by Kushner. This is very disturbing to me
[3:10:41.920 --> 3:10:46.520]  because my experience with Ronald Reagan and before that with President Richard
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:52.440]  Nixon is that a White House staff that is divided a White House staff that is
[3:10:52.440 --> 3:10:58.160]  not entirely focused on the president's agenda and how to move it forward will
[3:10:58.160 --> 3:11:05.480]  ultimately fail we have seen this in previous administrations and in this
[3:11:05.480 --> 3:11:11.120]  particular case I have no personal animus towards Jared Kushner I think he's a
[3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:17.200]  very very smart guy I think he did a good job of helping his father-in-law win
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:23.440]  the presidency but I disagree with the I guess it was Forbes magazine cover that
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:29.160]  said this is the man who elected Donald Trump no Donald Trump is the man who
[3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:35.720]  elected Donald Trump there is no Carl Rove like figure in Trump world there
[3:11:35.720 --> 3:11:41.520]  never has been it is most certainly not Roger Stone nor is it Jared Kushner the
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:47.080]  man with the courage the man with the foresight the man who understood
[3:11:47.080 --> 3:11:53.840]  viscerally how angry the American people were and are about the two-party
[3:11:53.840 --> 3:11:59.000]  duopoly and the political establishment that is taking this country down the
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:08.120]  drain in his acquiescence to the globalists they had certain vulnerabilities
[3:12:08.120 --> 3:12:13.240]  certain saturation point that the American people had reached only Donald
[3:12:13.240 --> 3:12:19.240]  Trump saw this the other 15 career politicians who opposed him for the
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:27.680]  nomination they did not see this this tsunami coming only Donald Trump did in
[3:12:27.680 --> 3:12:33.480]  any event we have again proven to be correct here at info wars calm predicting
[3:12:33.480 --> 3:12:42.280]  this White House contra temps and while mr. Kushner has much on his plate the
[3:12:42.280 --> 3:12:48.080]  China visit the entire question of Middle Eastern peace I fear that he does not
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:59.640]  understand either the info wars Breitbart daily caller tea party Liberty based
[3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:06.400]  coalition that elected Donald Trump nor do I think he understands the looming
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:14.240]  threat by Google and Facebook and others who are actively seeking to choke off
[3:13:14.240 --> 3:13:22.040]  our oxygen and and broadcasts or at least the reach of them like the one you're
[3:13:22.040 --> 3:13:29.040]  watching right now this is very real I can tell you just by an examination of
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:36.600]  the analytics of stone cold truth calm where I recommend that you visit to keep
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:42.320]  up with my political commentary but they have a stranglehold on our logarithms
[3:13:42.320 --> 3:13:47.640]  they are monkeying with them the number of people we are reaching the number of
[3:13:47.640 --> 3:13:53.320]  people who are retweeting is is being dwarfed compared to just a couple months
[3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:59.200]  ago in the closing days of the presidential campaign there were days
[3:13:59.200 --> 3:14:07.160]  that info wars calm had 15 18 20 million viewers on all platforms including
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:13.640]  Facebook live YouTube live of course the info wars site and now they are
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:21.200]  seeking to ratchet down our reach now if there's anyone who understands this it
[3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:26.360]  has to be Stephen K. Bannon mr. Bannon is formerly at the helm of Breitbart
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:34.640]  news vigorous I would say robust investigative journalism no it is not
[3:14:34.640 --> 3:14:41.440]  an anti-semitic site no it is not a bigoted site no they are not Klansman
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:49.440]  those are the lies of David Brock and his posse of misfits they are the
[3:14:49.440 --> 3:14:56.000]  harbinger of the Trump victory they are like info wars calm like daily caller
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:03.200]  like town hall like so many other fine sites they're dedicated to the truth and
[3:15:03.200 --> 3:15:10.000]  it is essential that Steve Bannon or others within the Trump White House make
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:16.080]  sure the president understands that this is an assault on his people this is an
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:22.280]  assault on his voters there is zero chance that the president can get
[3:15:22.280 --> 3:15:29.880]  reelected in 2020 if he chooses to run it with this kind of subterfuge this kind
[3:15:29.880 --> 3:15:36.440]  of subversion of what is now one of the major channels for communications in
[3:15:36.440 --> 3:15:42.320]  this country broadcast television is over folks the number of people watching
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:48.120]  is dwindling the number of people who are skeptical about what they say being
[3:15:48.120 --> 3:15:56.480]  true is soaring this is also happening to cable news CNN Fox they're in
[3:15:56.480 --> 3:16:04.040]  eclipse they're being surpassed by net-based media and that is why it is
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:10.720]  vitally important that the Trump administration examined the options for
[3:16:10.720 --> 3:16:19.640]  antitrust actions against Google against the Silicone Valley crowd that
[3:16:19.640 --> 3:16:25.000]  now seem to be making their way to New York to wine and dine Jared Kushner and
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:33.560]  Ivanka Trump now I am perhaps the world's largest fan of Ivanka Trump she's an
[3:16:33.560 --> 3:16:41.360]  amazing woman highly intelligent very articulate very decent very kind very
[3:16:41.360 --> 3:16:48.520]  approachable and somehow she balances being a key advisor to her father running
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:53.960]  her own lines of business which she is now left being a mother being a wife
[3:16:53.960 --> 3:17:00.240]  being physically fit being impeccably dressed how she balances all these roles
[3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:07.520]  I don't know but there is no criticism implied the crowd around Google had their
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:14.640]  way in the Obama White House the reporting of Dr. Jerry Corsi here at
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:19.800]  info wars.com have covered this issue perhaps better than anyone in the
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:26.680]  mainstream media or anyone else in alternative media this is a lynching
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:33.120]  that is planned this is an effort to choke off our oxygen and the idea that
[3:17:33.120 --> 3:17:40.040]  Google would let people like David Brock you know who is a left-wing hitman and a
[3:17:40.040 --> 3:17:47.960]  discredited one at that and Snopes for example Snopes.com make decisions as to
[3:17:47.960 --> 3:17:54.280]  what is and is not fake news this is an incredible violation of our first
[3:17:54.280 --> 3:18:00.760]  amendment rights this is the end of free speech as we know it in this country it
[3:18:00.760 --> 3:18:06.360]  may be the single most important element in terms of the long-term success of
[3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:13.240]  Donald Trump's presidency and whether or not he can make America great again so
[3:18:13.240 --> 3:18:18.320]  we are hopeful that Steve Bannon will put these issues in front of the
[3:18:18.320 --> 3:18:23.800]  president we are hopeful that the boarding party from Google that even
[3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:30.920]  today is attempting to insert a stooge as head of the FTC in the Trump
[3:18:30.920 --> 3:18:37.160]  administration we are hopeful that all of their motives and shenanigans will be
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:45.800]  exposed I thank you for welcoming us here on Info Wars we have so much more to
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:51.640]  talk about the retreat of Adam Schiff the congressman from California who
[3:18:51.640 --> 3:18:56.080]  thought he was going to go to the US Senate over my dead body is got another
[3:18:56.080 --> 3:19:01.880]  thing coming he's now according to real clear politics in full retreat admitting
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:07.600]  that there is no hard evidence at least not yet of any Russian collusion with
[3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:14.040]  the Trump campaign something I have been saying now for numerous months to the
[3:19:14.040 --> 3:19:22.760]  derision of the fake news media like the daily beast so this is very much
[3:19:22.760 --> 3:19:28.280]  Russia gate is something we're going to visit a little later on in the program
[3:19:28.280 --> 3:19:34.680]  because the false attacks of Schiff and Senator Adam Warner and pardon me
[3:19:34.680 --> 3:19:39.520]  Senator Mark Warner and others simply must be addressed thanks for joining us

[3:24:21.320 --> 3:24:28.160]  Stone stood as sitting in for my friend Alex Jones Alex Jones and Info Wars both
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:34.440]  MVPs in the recent Trump Revolution particularly in the nomination phase
[3:24:34.440 --> 3:24:41.800]  where I explain in my book the making of the president 2016 the vital role played
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:49.440]  by Info Wars.com watchers and listeners in the Trump Revolution it truly was a
[3:24:49.440 --> 3:24:56.640]  tsunami and my hats off to Alex Jones for his courage once he made the decision
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:25:02.480]  to support Donald J. Trump he never wavered when they threw the Billy Bush
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:09.280]  tape at Trump when they threw all kinds of false allegations when things looked
[3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:16.640]  dim when there was no guarantee of victory Alex Jones was not a sunshine
[3:25:16.640 --> 3:25:29.000]  soldier he was there he was solid and he rang the alerts to what was afoot he
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:35.520]  was aggressive on the attack in terms of exposing the crimes of Bill and Hillary
[3:25:35.520 --> 3:25:42.640]  Clinton and therefore yes I am proud to be here on Info Wars with a fellow
[3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:50.240]  warrior Alex Jones and the entire crew at Info Wars very big news today when it
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:57.920]  comes to Russia and the phony narrative put forward by the intelligence
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:04.240]  community whose motive is quite clear you see Hillary Clinton promised them an
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:10.760]  expansion of the proxy war in Syria they were really ringing their hands with
[3:26:10.760 --> 3:26:18.360]  glee my god and no fly zone we could even have World War three and the
[3:26:18.360 --> 3:26:23.680]  globalists and neocons who infect the central intelligence agency and the
[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:29.480]  other 17 agencies that are involved in intelligence collection including the
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:38.360]  NSA have been opposed to Donald Trump and his quest for peace in the region from
[3:26:38.360 --> 3:26:44.800]  the beginning now I've known Donald Trump for 40 years he has no illusions
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:51.640]  about the Russian Gulag he has no route illusions about the rottenness of the
[3:26:51.640 --> 3:27:00.560]  Russian system where gays and Christians and women and Jews are persecuted are
[3:27:00.560 --> 3:27:10.800]  oppressed he has no illusions about Vladimir Putin's past as a KGB agent he
[3:27:10.800 --> 3:27:20.200]  knows that Putin is a killer but he also understands that peace requires some
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:27.960]  negotiation and some effort perhaps just perhaps Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin
[3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:37.520]  can negotiate a just peace in the region given Assad's alleged gassing of
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:43.880]  children given the fact that the opponents of Assad are propped up by
[3:27:43.880 --> 3:27:50.440]  ISIS and the Saudis while Assad is propped up by the Russians and he's funding
[3:27:50.440 --> 3:27:57.680]  Hezbollah and Hamas and worse we have no friends in this conflict folks there is
[3:27:57.680 --> 3:28:03.560]  nothing here that is worth dropping a drop of American blood or spending a
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:09.680]  borrowed American dollar this explains why the intelligence agencies have
[3:28:09.680 --> 3:28:16.840]  invented the false Russian narrative it diverts attention from the Podesta
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:22.240]  brothers and the Clintons own business to activities in Russia the phony bank
[3:28:22.240 --> 3:28:29.720]  deal the phony gas deal the phony stock deal once again Dr. Jerry Corsi has
[3:28:29.720 --> 3:28:36.080]  reported on this both at WorldNet Daily and now at info wars.com so their
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:43.800]  strategy was brilliant divert from your own ties to Putin by falsely claiming
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:50.880]  Donald Trump is in bed with the Russians it's a farce and even fact
[3:28:50.880 --> 3:28:57.080]  chat.org which is a liberal leaning or I should say establishment leaning
[3:28:57.080 --> 3:29:02.760]  media organization financed by the Walter Inenberg Foundation even they found
[3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:08.880]  that the allegations by Congressman Adam Schiff against me and others involved
[3:29:08.880 --> 3:29:13.720]  with Trump but principally me that I knew about Podesta's email hacking in
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:20.880]  advance false or that I knew the scope and timing and extent of the wiki leaks
[3:29:20.880 --> 3:29:27.080]  disclosures about Hillary also false so I give credit to the folks at factcheck.org
[3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:50.800]  and I thank you for joining us here at info wars we're on the March the

[3:30:17.360 --> 3:30:22.520]  facilities might be the only option we have left to stop them from developing
[3:30:22.520 --> 3:30:27.480]  nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S. White House National Security

[3:30:32.960 --> 3:30:38.520]  disable its nuclear program there is a real possibility that North Korea will
[3:30:38.520 --> 3:30:42.760]  be able to hit the U.S. with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of
[3:30:42.760 --> 3:30:48.880]  Trump's first term as president meanwhile China has vowed to defend its
[3:30:48.880 --> 3:30:55.280]  territory at all costs if the U.S. launches a military attack against North

[3:33:09.520 --> 3:33:18.480]  tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's Roger Stone
[3:33:18.480 --> 3:33:27.400]  welcome back to info wars I'm Roger Stone New York Times best-selling
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:35.640]  author at Bon Vivant man about town and Liberty oriented American and loyal
[3:33:35.640 --> 3:33:42.520]  supporter of Donald Trump you know it does pain me to offer criticisms of the
[3:33:42.520 --> 3:33:47.600]  Trump administration they are not at any time criticisms of the president I'm
[3:33:47.600 --> 3:33:52.880]  deeply invested in his success I believe he is the one man who can make
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:59.720]  America great again and therefore when I see people in his administration
[3:33:59.720 --> 3:34:04.960]  disserving him you know in the beginning I am loath to talk about it but
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:11.560]  ultimately it has to be raised because this is our last best chance to save
[3:34:11.560 --> 3:34:17.840]  Western civilization to save American culture and the American system as we
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:24.840]  know it his election is a miracle nothing short of it I believe that Hillary
[3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:31.400]  Clinton and her allies spent as much as two billion dollars in hard dollars this
[3:34:31.400 --> 3:34:36.960]  doesn't count the soft money that mr. Soros was spending with whacked out
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:42.760]  groups like media matters for America and other front groups that were designed
[3:34:42.760 --> 3:34:51.040]  to hide the Clintons crimes and assault the Clintons critics now you have the
[3:34:51.040 --> 3:34:58.080]  question of mainstream media the constant negative drumbeat by CNN on Donald
[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:03.840]  Trump what was that worth in terms of commercial dollars because it was
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:10.280]  de facto advertising the answer is hundreds of millions of dollars so Donald
[3:35:10.280 --> 3:35:16.240]  Trump was outflanked in the old media and now we learn he was also outflanked in
[3:35:16.240 --> 3:35:22.560]  the new media that the barons of Silicon Valley were monkeying with his
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:30.320]  algorithms and blocking his communications many of you know firsthand
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:35.240]  about the new censorship that's being unleashed against conservatives
[3:35:35.240 --> 3:35:41.280]  libertarians and any supporters of Donald Trump for decades many of us on the
[3:35:41.280 --> 3:35:47.240]  right were you know we were unconcerned about the venture capital on the left
[3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:54.400]  that was flowing to tech companies but once established many of these large
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:36:00.360]  companies began a symbiotic relationship with the deep state
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:07.280]  Facebook Twitter Google and their property YouTube have all but locked up
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:13.520]  social media interactions in our country today the old anti-trust description
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:19.120]  fits most appropriately monopolies monopolies these are left-leaning
[3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:24.640]  organizations and they are tilting public discourse in the direction of
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:32.560]  censorship via a variety of nefarious yet hidden methods terms have been
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:37.760]  invented to describe what they're up to censorship activities conducted by the
[3:36:37.760 --> 3:36:42.560]  tech laughter called throttling shadow bands
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:50.960]  trollbots sjw puppets fake news flagging and many other in fact new terms are
[3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:56.320]  being invented every single day all of this activity boils down to a single
[3:36:56.320 --> 3:37:01.840]  objective and that is to strangle dissent and to strangle the alternative
[3:37:01.840 --> 3:37:08.240]  voices like info wars dot com we at stone cold truth have watched our
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:13.680]  audience as they have at info wars grow and grow and grow in the final months
[3:37:13.680 --> 3:37:20.160]  of the election finally we were able to reach millions of people and there is no
[3:37:20.160 --> 3:37:27.520]  doubt that this was a key factor in the upset victory of Donald Trump you see
[3:37:27.520 --> 3:37:33.040]  using rugged American individualism we have stood up to the voices and the
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:38.480]  ideology and frankly the abuse of the left
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:42.640]  but in their desperation now the tech left
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:47.520]  is starting to slant the playing field further and further
[3:37:47.520 --> 3:37:54.000]  to the point of censorship censorship of course was a tactic used by
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:38:04.160]  both Hitler and Stalin it is a it is a clear indicator of a coming totalitarian state
[3:38:04.160 --> 3:38:07.920]  see i think the wackiest left-wing group in the country
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:12.400]  people as irresponsible and dishonest and corrupt as say
[3:38:12.400 --> 3:38:16.800]  david brock they should not be banned on the internet
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:20.720]  they should not be banned or throttled back on
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:25.200]  uh... facebook everyone should have a voice
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:30.160]  that is the fundamental bedrock principle of our first amendment
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:34.160]  in our american constitution and that is what we're
[3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:40.960]  fighting about in this particular fight the left have professional agitators
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:45.280]  by the thousands and brain trusts by the score
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:50.160]  they have deep pockets more money than they know what to do with
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:54.080]  and they're using it today to kill the liberty
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:58.400]  movement and try to kill off the presidency of donald
[3:38:58.400 --> 3:39:03.600]  jay trump make no mistake about it this is the preparation
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:10.320]  for a silent coup that lies ahead that is how bitter and disappointed the
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:14.000]  globalists are in their giant multi-billion
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:18.320]  dollar investment in hillary clinton
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:21.200]  the tech left is extinguishing the passion
[3:39:21.200 --> 3:39:25.600]  and volunteer spirit that we see so prevalent here at info wars
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:29.840]  dot com using professional trolls to spread
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:36.560]  hate is another key tactic if you go to twitter today
[3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:44.480]  they are attacking my wife attacking my family attacking my dog attacking my
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:48.480]  hair attacking my glasses attacking my
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:55.520]  clothing it grows tedious very tedious uh they say
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:39:59.840]  that i am uh all kinds of things but they never mentioned
[3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:04.240]  new york times bestselling author they never mention
[3:40:04.240 --> 3:40:08.640]  the fact that i am a proud veteran of the campaigns of both
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:13.600]  ronald reagan and donald trump they would have you believe
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:19.760]  that i am lucifer himself when it is the left that is
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:26.240]  demonistic it is the left who are agnostic it is the left
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:31.440]  who believe in the godless religion of globalism
[3:40:31.440 --> 3:40:39.280]  now uh we understand that the left is in a panic and we are very clear
[3:40:39.280 --> 3:40:43.920]  about what the strategy uh and the game plan
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:50.240]  of the tech left is and this is not going to go down
[3:40:50.240 --> 3:40:55.200]  the way they think it is because they are subject to
[3:40:55.200 --> 3:40:59.840]  antitrust law in this administration they are
[3:40:59.840 --> 3:41:04.160]  subject to uh the dictates and rules passed by
[3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:10.320]  congress and signed into law by the president anyone who thinks that alex
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:15.120]  jones or uh anyone else uh who is involved in
[3:41:15.120 --> 3:41:19.520]  alternative media is going to take this sitting down that we are
[3:41:19.520 --> 3:41:24.320]  going to give up and surrender without a
[3:41:24.320 --> 3:41:28.800]  bloody fight does not understand the nature
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:34.240]  of our determination to take our country back
[3:41:34.240 --> 3:41:38.160]  now if sent if attorney general sessions
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:46.320]  would stop examining those states that have legally approved
[3:41:46.320 --> 3:41:50.080]  recreational marijuana through the process of
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:56.320]  constitutional amendment sometimes in many states requiring a 60 margin
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:42:03.440]  and focused on the criminal and antitrust and tortuous interference
[3:42:03.440 --> 3:42:09.280]  of the internet giants there is no question in my mind
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:16.400]  that there is appropriate legal action there why is this so important
[3:42:16.400 --> 3:42:21.920]  in all kinder the chances of donald trump being reelected in 2020
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:28.640]  are zero if the vibrancy of alternative media is cut off
[3:42:28.640 --> 3:42:34.000]  if we return to the days in which mainstream media
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:38.960]  held an absolute monopoly on the dissemination
[3:42:38.960 --> 3:42:45.680]  of political information you see in 1963 for example there were only
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:49.280]  three networks and therefore if they didn't report
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:55.120]  something it didn't happen this is why i have believed that the
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:42:59.440]  cover-up in the murder of president john f kennedy
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:05.600]  was so easy to perpetrate the mainstream media of the day was able
[3:43:05.600 --> 3:43:12.720]  able to easily control the narrative as you will find in my book the
[3:43:12.720 --> 3:43:17.920]  the man who killed kennedy the case against lbj
[3:43:17.920 --> 3:43:22.960]  fbi agents actually showed up at the daily newspaper in dallas
[3:43:22.960 --> 3:43:26.960]  and dictated the stories for page one
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:31.120]  and killed stories that did not agree with the government's
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:35.440]  immediate narrative that lee harvey oswald acted alone
[3:43:35.440 --> 3:43:42.640]  and he killed john kennedy now today such a claim could never be
[3:43:42.640 --> 3:43:48.800]  sustained because of the vibrancy of the internet
[3:43:48.800 --> 3:43:54.480]  and alternative media there would be instead of one
[3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:58.080]  zappeter film of the kennedy assassination
[3:43:58.080 --> 3:44:04.080]  there would be hundreds of cell phone cameras recording the event for
[3:44:04.080 --> 3:44:09.280]  history making a cover-up almost impossible
[3:44:09.280 --> 3:44:13.440]  that gives you a graphic example of why it is crucial
[3:44:13.440 --> 3:44:18.480]  that this fight be fought and that the trump administration
[3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:25.760]  understand the stakes and what is uh at hand in terms of this
[3:44:25.760 --> 3:44:32.080]  challenge this is a life and death struggle not only for the future of
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:36.560]  the liberty movement but the future of the country itself
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:40.160]  this is certainly in raw political terms
[3:44:40.160 --> 3:44:46.000]  a crucial fight for the future of the trump presidency
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:50.480]  does son-in-law jared kushner understand this challenge
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:57.920]  or is he being lulled to sleep by the uh silicone valley
[3:44:57.920 --> 3:45:01.840]  supplicants now taking the trek to new york
[3:45:01.840 --> 3:45:08.720]  to wine and dine the presidential son-in-law and his wife now before
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:16.000]  we leave this segment i want to put in a plug for a product that i have

[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:10.880]  anything else you can find on the commercial market when it comes
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:18.800]  to an overall nutrition that helps build the immune system
[3:46:18.800 --> 3:46:25.200]  and also helps kill the free radicals uh that are a result of eating

[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:54.480]  the making of the president 2016 the story of how donald trump orchestrated
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:47:59.920]  an american revolution right there at the info wars dot com store
[3:47:59.920 --> 3:48:04.560]  this historic book lays the groundwork on the entire
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:09.600]  russian myth on the phony narrative created by
[3:48:09.600 --> 3:48:14.160]  john pedesta to distract from his own business activities
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:21.840]  with the kremlin and to cast questions about the legitimacy
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:29.360]  and the stability of the trump administration there is no russian
[3:48:29.360 --> 3:48:35.120]  collusion even congressman adam schiff a man who i said from the beginning
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:41.440]  was full of schiff even he is now in retreat the hard evidence that they
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:46.000]  promised us existed seems to have gone missing
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:50.480]  and now with the criminal activities of susan rice
[3:48:50.480 --> 3:48:55.120]  well the the the focus is back where it belonged
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:59.600]  on those who use the russian collusion myth
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:05.840]  as a rationale as a legal justification for spying
[3:49:05.840 --> 3:49:09.680]  on the president i predict to you here and now
[3:49:09.680 --> 3:49:13.520]  that we will learn that surveillance of donald trump was broader
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:17.760]  and longer than we have been told thus far
[3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:22.160]  but the fbi director and the nsa director
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:26.320]  admiral rogers both testified under oaths that there was
[3:49:26.320 --> 3:49:34.720]  no surveillance of the president that turns out to be perjury a lie
[3:49:34.720 --> 3:49:39.680]  and as we learned here at info wars dot com only weeks ago
[3:49:39.680 --> 3:49:44.000]  the government has had an active program called drag net
[3:49:44.000 --> 3:49:49.040]  that has been monitoring and recording the telephone conversations of
[3:49:49.040 --> 3:49:55.120]  some 600 plus prominent americans some other not so prominent americans
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:50:00.400]  but that list included donald j trump who was monitored from his new york
[3:50:00.400 --> 3:50:04.960]  office his new york apartment his palm beach apartment
[3:50:04.960 --> 3:50:08.400]  his palm beach country club or golf club
[3:50:08.400 --> 3:50:15.680]  and several other trump resorts folks the deep state is busted
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:20.720]  and they know it and that's why this hysterical attack
[3:50:20.720 --> 3:50:24.960]  on the media outlets like info wars dot com
[3:50:24.960 --> 3:50:28.880]  who are letting the american people know what is really

[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:13.200]  intention of standing for it and no intention of not fighting
[3:55:13.200 --> 3:55:18.560]  this effort on every front i want to take a minute to pay
[3:55:18.560 --> 3:55:24.320]  tribute to two of my colleagues jack posobyak who has now joined the rebel
[3:55:24.320 --> 3:55:30.000]  as their new washington dc correspondent jack is an important
[3:55:30.000 --> 3:55:33.520]  foot soldier in the trump revolution one of the
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:40.160]  key figures behind citizens for trump an independent organization and i salute
[3:55:40.160 --> 3:55:44.160]  jack on his new assignment and my hats off to mike
[3:55:44.160 --> 3:55:51.280]  cernovich a patriot a freedom fighter uh and the man who learned and passed on
[3:55:51.280 --> 3:55:57.280]  to the media that um susan rice had illegally
[3:55:57.280 --> 3:56:00.640]  unmasked a number of key trump associates
[3:56:00.640 --> 3:56:06.240]  myself included uh in her efforts to sift
[3:56:06.240 --> 3:56:10.720]  intelligence information for political reasons
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:14.720]  now susan rice has a history as a proven liar
[3:56:14.720 --> 3:56:21.600]  if you read my book on ben gazi you know that she lied about the idea
[3:56:21.600 --> 3:56:29.520]  that a mob a rabble attacked our mission in ben gazi incensed over an
[3:56:29.520 --> 3:56:35.200]  anti-islamic video uh that was allegedly shown
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:41.920]  once in turkey so we have a habitual liar and now
[3:56:41.920 --> 3:56:45.360]  i agree with senator ran paul's notion
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:49.200]  that it's time for a subpoena and it's time
[3:56:49.200 --> 3:56:55.680]  for her to testify before the congress speaking of testifying before the
[3:56:55.680 --> 3:56:58.960]  congress i have let the senate and house
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:03.760]  intelligence committees know that i am prepared to show up without a subpoena
[3:57:03.760 --> 3:57:07.280]  that i am not asking for any kind of immunity
[3:57:07.280 --> 3:57:13.760]  and that i want to testify in public you see i will put the lie
[3:57:13.760 --> 3:57:17.440]  to this myth of russian collusion to elect
[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:21.280]  donald trump and demonstrate how it has been used
[3:57:21.280 --> 3:57:27.760]  for the rationale to illegally surveil first candidate trump and then
[3:57:27.760 --> 3:57:35.440]  president elect trump and perhaps even president trump stay tuned
