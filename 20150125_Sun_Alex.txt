[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the run.
[00:06.000 --> 00:11.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.000 --> 00:22.000]  I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime.
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  Reflecting.
[00:23.000 --> 00:28.000]  Reflecting on my past life.
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.000]  And it doesn't, have much time.
[00:35.000 --> 00:44.000]  Because at five o'clock, they take me to the gallows fall.
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  The sands of time.
[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  For the human race.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  I'm running low.
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  But I am the human race, so are you.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  We're not team players, is the problem.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  Running low.
[01:03.000 --> 01:05.000]  Running low.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  Running low.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  Not hourglass.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  Running low.
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  I guess my whole broadcast is a ghost of Armageddon's future.
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  Attempting to warn the people as best I can about certain
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  technocratic hell on earth that we face if we allow the psychopaths
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  to control the planet to take over.
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.000]  Crank it back up.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  Powerful transmission.
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  When the praise comes to read me the lessons.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  Take a look to the bars of the lessons.
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  Of a wall that has gone very wrong.
[01:44.000 --> 01:47.000]  This is just some crazy dream.
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  When you realize that life is about five minutes long in a scheme of things,
[01:54.000 --> 02:05.000]  it goes by so quickly.
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.000]  Then you realize you are always five minutes to midnight.
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  You're always being marched to that gallows pool.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  Every time you put your children in an automobile,
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.000]  whether you live in South Africa,
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  Mexico, or Germany, or Japan, or Russia,
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.000]  or the Straits of Hormuz,
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  when you drive down that highway,
[02:26.000 --> 02:34.000]  it's the number one cause of death worldwide.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  But there's no fanfare.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  There's no fear mongering.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  There's no Hollywood movies demonizing it,
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  so people are unaware of it.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  They just line up and happily commit to it.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Because that's the human spirit.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  It's not to be cowards.
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  And to absolutely accept your environment when you have to live in it,
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  but to change it and make it better.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  But what happens when the industrialization
[02:59.000 --> 03:08.000]  and the modernization and the safety first public service angle
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  becomes a poison cyanide lining?
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  What happens when the machine is possessed by a eugenics ghost?
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  How do you fight that?
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  How do you change that?
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  There's a lot of different ways to do it.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.000]  But the biggest and most important for my research
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  and historical experience,
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  20 years fighting this toe-to-toe,
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  is you've got to believe in humanity and you've got to decide humanity's good.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  You've got to decide you want to build other people up.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  You've got to decide you want to be honorable.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  You've got to realize there is evil in this world
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  and that it's running the show right now
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  and that we're in a deep crisis.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  But most people just want to look fashionable, act cool,
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.000]  and have a good time.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  And they think they're unhappy
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  because they're not having a big enough party.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  And all experience has shown
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  that it is the animating contest of liberty
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  that makes you happy, empowered, and great.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  The problem is, as I've said a thousand times,
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  the great men and women that have delivered us to this current position
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  are dead and gone.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  Dead and gone.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  Gone, gone, gone.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  In its place, the decadent slobs,
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  the mightiest of us,
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  weak compared to those that came before.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Dishonored, fallen,
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  slouching towards Gomorrah.
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  There is a way to avert this great plan,
[04:56.000 --> 05:06.000]  and I have not the strength to lose it.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  in our quest to bring you

[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.

[05:59.000 --> 06:23.000]  This is an emergency transmission from FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[06:23.000 --> 06:31.000]  There is a war happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.000]  We are the Resistance. We are the Info War.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  Well, we've almost gone through the first month of the 2015. It's hard to believe.
[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  It is Sunday, the 25th day of January 2015.
[06:46.000 --> 06:52.000]  I am your host Alex Jones. We'll be here as we are live every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  About once a month, David Knight, great Info Wars Nightly News anchor, hosts the Sunday show.
[06:58.000 --> 07:04.000]  He does a great job and is becoming very, very popular with the listeners, which is a great thing
[07:04.000 --> 07:10.000]  because his acumen and understanding of world events is right up there with mine
[07:10.000 --> 07:17.000]  and in some cases more informed than my shelf and many of the experts we have on the broadcast.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  I appreciate David Knight being here last Sunday.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  I'm here, ladies and gentlemen, at 407 Central Standard Time.
[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  Many stations rebroadcast it in other time slots. We want to thank all of those affiliates,
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  both the old affiliates and the new affiliates.
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  I've been doing this syndicated radio broadcast for 20 years.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  And for about seven years, I've been broadcasting on Sundays.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  I figured that a lot of stations out there weren't ready to pick up the show weekdays.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  So if I could get them to try out the broadcast, that they would end up picking it up weekdays
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  or weeknights, and that certainly happened.
[07:53.000 --> 08:01.000]  We went from about 70 affiliates seven years ago or so, 68, 70 sub-affiliates.
[08:01.000 --> 08:06.000]  And then with the Sunday show, almost every new affiliate we've gotten has picked up the Sunday show.
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.000]  They've gotten a lot of listeners support, gotten good listenership, ratings, community support.
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.000]  And they start putting us on re-eared at night, and then almost every station, then within about a year,
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.000]  ends up carrying us live during the day.
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  On big stations, mom-and-pop stations, little stations, they're all precious of every size across the United States.
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  Now over 185 affiliates across the United States, over 100 carrying this Sunday broadcast.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  But you know, stations come and stations go.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  They change formats, they change directions, and that's why it's always important to keep growing,
[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  because as we gain stations, we lose stations.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  We've probably lost over 100 affiliates over the years.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  They've switched to ESPN.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  I can't tell you how many times I've been on a station in Orlando, or in Corpus Christi,
[08:57.000 --> 09:06.000]  or in New York City, or in Los Angeles, or in St. Louis, or in Minnesota.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  St. Paul, I remember, and we're on for a couple years, get great listenership.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  It's just that they sell, or they change formats.
[09:12.000 --> 09:13.000]  That's what happens.
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.000]  And that's why no one listening to this broadcast should take it for granted.
[09:17.000 --> 09:28.000]  Because these type of hardcore, pro-America, common sense, Americana, constitutional views are very popular.
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  They are common sense.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  But at the same time, the power structure in the entire system does not like to fund it.
[09:37.000 --> 09:46.000]  The establishment does not go out and raise $400 million a year, like to do for NPR, for true libertarian talk radio.
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  You don't have George Soros pumping billions of dollars into pro-liberty, pro-individual type media.
[09:53.000 --> 10:04.000]  It is you, the individual, that support the local sponsors, that support the local shows, that tell the station why you're supporting sponsors, or why you're a sponsor.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  And it's those of you that spread the word about this radio show that make it possible.
[10:10.000 --> 10:17.000]  And we've had a lot of ups and downs in 20 years on air, but if you look at the graph, it just goes straight up, to frightening levels.
[10:17.000 --> 10:24.000]  It's frightening to easily have 18 million viewers and listeners a week by every metric.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  In fact, that's a very low number. Sometimes we have 10 million YouTube views a week.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  But if you count AM and FM stations, 3 million listeners a day, most folks tune in once or twice a week.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  If you add it all together, it's about 10 million listened terrestrially every week, one way or another.
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  If you add in YouTube and satellite and shortwave and other platforms, it's over 25 million.
[10:46.000 --> 10:53.000]  But we just say 18 million because through some of the ad agencies that are out there that have derivative breakdown aggregates, it's 18 million.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  That number's about two years old.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.000]  This radio show reaches 18 million people a week.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  That is just a gargantuan responsibility.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  And that doesn't mean we're in listening areas that have 18 million people.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  A lot of talk show hosts will be in a city with a million listeners potentially and say, we have a million listeners.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  No, no, no.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  Rated, we have 18 million.
[11:14.000 --> 11:22.000]  18 million people tune into this radio show worldwide, about half of them in the United States.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  So we're talking 9 million a week in the United States.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  Other places were Top Canada, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  You can go to alexa.com, alexa.com.
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  And it's an Amazon company that does online ratings.
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.000]  It's pretty accurate overall. It matches our Google Analytics and other ad agency arbitrarna, wide spectrum analysis we have.
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  And you look at it and it's scary how the numbers fit depending on the metric, whether it's Google Analytics or what Amazon uses.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  And you can see the countries where we're huge.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  We're bigger in places like Switzerland than we are in the U.S.
[12:03.000 --> 12:12.000]  Whereas we might be number 400 in the U.S., last time I checked her websites, we might be number five in some African countries.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  Yeah.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  I mean, this broadcast is really special.
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.000]  And I'm not up here on some high horse before I get into all this news telling you, hey, we're big, we wear big britches.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  Boy, we're really special. Give us a red carpet. It's the opposite.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  I'm telling you that we are having major effects worldwide.
[12:33.000 --> 12:42.000]  And that if other people listening who are already talk show host or who are publishers or who are scientists or lawyers who are well spoken,
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  if you would engage in the fight for humanity, you would have a big success as well.
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  And you spiritually and physically would gain great wealth for your family's future.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  This is where the real fight is.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  We're not in the fanciest jet or sports car or the biggest mansion.
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  And believe me, I could have all of that.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  And I've had a taste of all of that and it means nothing.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  My rank right now in the U.S. is 544.
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.000]  Oh, no, I'm sorry. MSNBC is 544. We're 356 in the U.S. I thought we'd gone down.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  I'm sorry. We've gone up about 100 points. Sorry.
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.000]  MSNBC.com is 544. We're 350 something. Sorry.
[13:20.000 --> 13:28.000]  So that's why they have George Soros Media Matters doing investigations on us, sending private detectives,
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  literally digging through our trash cans.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  They're scared. And they should be.
[13:33.000 --> 13:44.000]  Because if a bumbling, stuttering, hillbilly redneck with no college degree can be kicking your ass worldwide right now,
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  can you imagine when the other men, greater than I stand up, it's game over?
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  And let me give you a message that I've been given for 20 years.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  Because in my heart, I've always known this.
[13:55.000 --> 14:02.000]  I'm here to blow the alarm, to blow the trumpet, to get the real warriors up.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  That's all I'm doing. I got big lungs. I'm willing to scream out.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  I'm up there on the parapet. The enemy tells me there's no attack going on. Bull.
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  We're losing our freedoms up one side and down the other. We're being enslaved and I've been blowing that watchman horn.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  I've been blowing that trumpet. And let me tell you, the fires are being lit.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  I can see the watchtowers firing up all over the world as humanity and that great spirit fires up.
[14:26.000 --> 14:34.000]  And it's such an incredible honor for all of my foibles and all my warts and everything that I've done that's been bad.
[14:34.000 --> 14:40.000]  I did it from a position of trying to do the right thing and trying to warn people and it's hit the zeitgeist.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  It's hit pay dirt, pay dirt over and over again.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  And I'm not looking for physical wealth, but I have raised, I did the math a few months ago with the accountants,
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  $187 million in 20 years to finance this operation.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  That's an example of what one person can do.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  It cost me tens of millions of dollars a year to run this operation and you, the listeners, have come and supported us
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  with the high quality products at infowarsstore.com and we've put 95% of that money back into the operation after taxes
[15:13.000 --> 15:19.000]  and it's had a huge effect. So I salute you all. You have helped forge this shored.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  It's already had such a great effect that is infowars.com and presidentplanet.com.
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  And you've helped forge this shored that I know that if we take the proper actions, it can be the weapon
[15:31.000 --> 15:37.000]  that begins to open up the veins of the globalists of the information war and we will bring them down.
[15:37.000 --> 15:45.000]  We're here, we're real, 110% on the battlefield, committed to human liberty, committed to fair play,
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.000]  committed to a level playing field, committed to empowering families, committed to self defense,
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  committed to space travel and victory and innovation.

[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  and that's what you'll find at infowarslife.com.
[17:12.000 --> 17:19.000]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the infowarslife line because they are not of the very highest quality
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.000]  or because they're not 100% organic or because they don't ask all of the strictest toxicology tests there are
[17:26.000 --> 17:32.000]  that we have listed at infowarslife.com. Whether it's Survival Shield, nascent iodine or DNA force,
[17:32.000 --> 17:43.000]  super male vitality, super female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder, I believe that all of these products will blow you away

[17:59.000 --> 18:04.000]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  the exclusive Infowarslife secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.000]  This ultra clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[18:19.000 --> 18:26.000]  The most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimentical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  the same kind used in B12 injections and adenosylcobalamin,
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.000]  the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.000]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue and then swallowed.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  No needles, no injections. Don't take my word for it.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  Discover the secret. Secret 12.

[19:49.000 --> 20:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.000 --> 20:30.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:30.000 --> 20:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're 20 minutes on the broadcast and I'm not even hit the news yet.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  I know that's why you tune in. The reason I spent a segment talking about this broadcast
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  and the effect it's had was a testament to the power of human liberty
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  and what individuals can do when they take action.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  And the major news organization with more than 50 crew members with the nightly news,
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  the documentary films, everything we do that reaches more than 20 million people
[21:09.000 --> 21:13.000]  a week, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  And the films that have been seen, it's ridiculous amounts.
[21:19.000 --> 21:30.000]  It's just amazing.
[21:30.000 --> 21:37.000]  And we can change the course of history if we just realize that we have power.
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  That's what it takes.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  And we're not dead, we're not in a coma.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  The whole social engineering program is about keeping us in a coma.
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  Now, just look at the stacks of news I have here.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  Because I didn't start pontificating about this radio show because I had lack of news.
[21:54.000 --> 22:06.000]  I mean, it just all ties together and it's all so epic, so incredible that I can't even give credence to breaking it down.
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Look at this story from Friday.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  It's up on dredgereport.com right now.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  It's by Paul Joseph Watson, infowars.com.
[22:13.000 --> 22:20.000]  And you can go right to the Davos Switzerland website and watch the video where they announced global governments here
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  and then government mosquito drones will extract your DNA, forcibly inoculate you.
[22:26.000 --> 22:32.000]  And they said, quote, privacy is dead, they announced.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  Eric Schmidt announced the same thing from Google.
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.000]  This was from a professor, Seltzer in computer science at Harvard University.
[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  That's one article out of 200 plus I've got here.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  They're all just as insane.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  It's not me saying all this.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  It's what they're building.
[22:54.000 --> 23:04.000]  And the paradigm shift is, for the first 10, 15 years or so, I was covering stuff that was in white papers, government documents, legislation, stuff.
[23:04.000 --> 23:11.000]  Listeners were mailing me that worked in universities, trade publications, and people hear this stuff and think, you're crazy.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  Now it's just out in the open.
[23:13.000 --> 23:20.000]  So we've kind of crossed that event horizon, Rubicon now, where some people go, OK, global government's being formed.
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.000]  What's the big deal?
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  You know, on Star Trek, it's a global government.
[23:24.000 --> 23:32.000]  It's all going to be kumbaya, happy, lovey, and the planet's like some giant whole foods with trendies walking around.
[23:32.000 --> 23:39.000]  That's only the first level of the takeover to make you think it's going to bring you success in the establishment's own words.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  In the end game, it's hell on earth.
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  And I want to break that down right now.
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  But first off, Edward Snowden, Apple iPhone with secret eye feature allows government to spy on you.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  That's old news, but there he said it.
[23:53.000 --> 24:03.000]  Greece's anti bailout party wins election, death of prosecutor shakes faith and president and Argentina government institutions.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.000]  I mean, he said they're going to kill me there and they killed him.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  And now they're calling a conspiracy theory.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  If you if you question it just doesn't work anymore to say that major blizzard.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  De Blasio says it would be the biggest snowstorm ever to hit the city.
[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  Al Gore says, well, that the cold weather is caused by global warming.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  Iran lawmakers drafting law on nuclear enrichment hike.
[24:26.000 --> 24:35.000]  So the West is suddenly allied with Iran and they're suddenly said they're going to blow up Israel and create nuclear weapons and all the rest of it is just crazy.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  And meanwhile, our government's also backing Saudi Arabia and Al Qaeda running around under the name Isis.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  China admittedly is going into depression.
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.000]  That's the one in Guardian.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  We predicted that years ago.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  Harry Dent and other Harvey Dent and others.
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  Not the not the comic book character, but Harry did Harvey Dent.
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  We should get him back on.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  I tell that guy's amazing.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  We'll also get into hating whitey.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  Arizona State stirs pot teaching the problem of whites class.
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  See, the problem is white people.
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  Yeah, that's seven percent of the world population.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  Let's just get rid of them.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  We'll get rid of Beethoven and rocket ships as well.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  We're going to get to that.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  Palin says she's seriously interested in 2016 campaign.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  Hey, I'll say it.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  Palin's a lot better than Jeff Bush or Chris Christie.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  She's the real deal.
[25:28.000 --> 25:39.000]  And that's why the system dump, you know, attacks her and says she's dumb because she's a woman with these fake feminist dirt bags that are really just social controllers that want to dominate women and lecture to them and not let them make their own decisions.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  Every fake leftist feminist doesn't want a woman to be armed.
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  That right there shows you don't care about women.
[25:44.000 --> 25:52.000]  I mean, Sarah Palin is so much better than the current so-called neocon leadership of the public party.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  Now, is she as good as Rand Paul or Ted Cruz?
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  No, she make a hell of a VP.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  That's a winning ticket right there.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  Let's get down.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  Oh, yeah.
[26:02.000 --> 26:13.000]  Can you imagine Cruz Palin or and I'm sorry if she was as smart or as constitutional as a Ted Cruz, I'd say her.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  But I mean, I've just I've listened to them both read their writings.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  They're both really smart.
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  I don't think in the law and giving slick speeches, I'm as good as Ted Cruz.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  I'm just I'm sorry.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  He's just more presidential.
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.000]  It's just the winning ticket is Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin or Rand Paul, Sarah Palin.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  I mean, just it cannot be beaten.
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  Look at every Democrat.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  I'm sorry.
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  I'm celebrating.
[26:37.000 --> 26:46.000]  Oh, we could just just just turn our power plants back on and just not sell the country as derivatives and get and repeal Obamacare.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  I'd save the country right there.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  I'm sorry.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  I'm having I'm having all they call them precipitation dreams.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  I better stop right now.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  So we've got that in the stack.
[26:59.000 --> 27:11.000]  We've got this whole Seahawks ballgate inflated gate deflated gate and the Patriots have said they've done nothing wrong.
[27:11.000 --> 27:20.000]  The reason this story is important is that it shows how the public loves a conspiracy theory that doesn't affect anything real other than your fantasy football.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  I guess you're gambling.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Who cares if the New England Patriots cheated?
[27:24.000 --> 27:25.000]  It's a game.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  It's entertainment.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  All these teams are cheating.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  They're all on Roy's.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  They're all on growth hormone.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  I mean, most of them are.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  This is a constant corruption.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  They're on drugs.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  They're injecting them with painkillers on their knees.
[27:36.000 --> 27:37.000]  Everyone knows this.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  Of course, they're being brain damaged.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  Of course, it's a scam.
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  Of course, but it doesn't.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  They're not taxing us other than their fake football stadiums that we had to pay for.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  They're not taking my guns.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  They're not putting fluoride in my water.
[27:53.000 --> 28:08.000]  But people love, oh, yeah, the Patriots, they're involved in a conspiracy and everybody wants to email me and talk about it and go over every level of it and how, why the teams bring their own balls and everything else.
[28:08.000 --> 28:11.000]  There's all the ball jokes that go along with it.
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  How is there a conspiracy here?
[28:14.000 --> 28:20.000]  But there's not with LIBOR and world interest rates or the private Federal Reserve or derivatives.
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  I mean, that's what really affects you.
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  That's where you're really being screwed over.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  But it's boring suits and ties.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  I mean, who cares?
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  So let's cover this right now.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  Patriots say they followed the rules and accept no blame.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  Belichick says 100% Patriots did nothing wrong.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  Well, there's referees that you see handling those balls.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  I mean, they love to squeeze on them and see if they're inflated or not.
[28:46.000 --> 28:56.000]  You know, by the end of the game, I guess they, do they drain them before they pass them on to like sell them on the eBay or whatever?
[28:56.000 --> 29:24.000]  Or is that Obama?
[29:24.000 --> 29:44.000]  Like all of these.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  There's two.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  in the body. It's great stuff.

[33:02.560 --> 33:25.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.920 --> 33:32.600]  We've been done over 100 times, it does not increase our value, it does not somehow promote
[33:32.600 --> 33:33.760]  profit disease.
[33:33.760 --> 33:39.880]  All it does is it says, you've got to pay the bills that you've already racked up Congress.
[33:39.880 --> 33:49.120]  So the national debts doubled under Obama from your listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:49.120 --> 34:01.160]  And what, 9 trillion to 18 trillion and it hadn't gone up because he said so.
[34:01.160 --> 34:05.640]  And if you disagree with that, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[34:05.640 --> 34:11.160]  Well then brand me a conspiracy theorist, that means someone that questions known liars.
[34:11.160 --> 34:15.240]  The media can point at a bunch of schizophrenics online, you know, that think all sorts of
[34:15.240 --> 34:17.920]  crazy stuff and say, oh, that's a conspiracy theorist.
[34:17.920 --> 34:22.760]  You know, a conspiracy theorist is someone demonized by the known lying mainstream media
[34:22.760 --> 34:27.480]  who doesn't buy into lies anymore.
[34:27.480 --> 34:32.720]  Now I mentioned a lot of this news, but let me drill into it right now.
[34:32.720 --> 34:44.040]  Why are we in so much trouble, A, B, why do we need to wake up now to avert this large
[34:44.040 --> 34:50.720]  global corporate plan that is being carried out?
[34:50.720 --> 34:53.600]  I don't have to sit up here and convince you global governments being formed that large
[34:53.600 --> 34:58.880]  corporate industry running at the large megabanks created thousands of trillions in fake derivatives
[34:58.880 --> 35:00.280]  they used to buy out the world.
[35:00.280 --> 35:01.280]  That's now mainstream news.
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.400]  I don't have to convince you that international bankers rule the world and call the shots.
[35:06.400 --> 35:07.400]  That's on CNBC.
[35:07.400 --> 35:11.160]  In fact, when we come back to the next intro, let's play that intro that has that just for
[35:11.160 --> 35:14.440]  new listeners that don't haven't heard it over and over again, all the newscasts announcing
[35:14.440 --> 35:18.760]  were slaves to private bankers, aren't we all just slaves, international bankers?
[35:18.760 --> 35:20.520]  Don't they control the governments?
[35:20.520 --> 35:21.520]  Every guest.
[35:21.520 --> 35:23.640]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[35:23.640 --> 35:29.480]  So Rod Paul 30 years ago, myself 20 years ago, we don't have to now convince people this
[35:29.480 --> 35:30.720]  is going on.
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.160]  It's admitted because they're in the end game.
[35:33.160 --> 35:35.800]  The question is, where do they take us in the end game?
[35:35.800 --> 35:40.560]  And so you might want to listen to us now because we were right before just kind of a
[35:40.560 --> 35:44.560]  rule that you like to go to people for financial advice that have been right over and over
[35:44.560 --> 35:45.560]  again.
[35:45.560 --> 35:49.680]  You like to go to folks that that are guides that know how to take you to the best fishing
[35:49.680 --> 35:54.160]  holes who are right over and over again have the highest ratings or restaurants that have
[35:54.160 --> 35:55.160]  the highest ratings.
[35:55.160 --> 35:59.200]  You know, you go to who tends to deliver.
[35:59.200 --> 36:02.280]  Now does mainstream media deliver?
[36:02.280 --> 36:05.840]  Well, for the last 30, 40 years, they've denied all this.
[36:05.840 --> 36:08.560]  Now that it's coming out, they just throw it in your face.
[36:08.560 --> 36:11.520]  So more and more, we can use mainstream media because they're just reporting on what's
[36:11.520 --> 36:13.680]  already happened.
[36:13.680 --> 36:18.520]  There is a collection of private families and mega central banks that control government's
[36:18.520 --> 36:22.680]  issuance of currency and credit who have taken much of the world over.
[36:22.680 --> 36:27.520]  They're mopping up a few sectors, Russia, China, the Middle East and parts of Africa
[36:27.520 --> 36:28.520]  right now.
[36:28.520 --> 36:32.840]  They're taking those over by the sword and by economic conquest and economic depression,
[36:32.840 --> 36:35.440]  economic warfare.
[36:35.440 --> 36:43.120]  And their stated plan is to end the Renaissance that started roughly 500 years ago with the
[36:43.120 --> 36:45.680]  Gutenberg Press.
[36:45.680 --> 36:50.400]  That's the printing press, ladies and gentlemen, that first printed the Gutenberg Bible.
[36:50.400 --> 36:52.800]  This is their own stated goal.
[36:52.800 --> 36:55.640]  I'm going to get into Davos openly announcing this in a moment.
[36:55.640 --> 36:56.640]  You understand?
[36:56.640 --> 36:58.080]  They're announcing this.
[36:58.080 --> 37:00.560]  So you're not allowed to say it's not happening.
[37:00.560 --> 37:01.560]  Okay.
[37:01.560 --> 37:03.880]  Now, they don't like the Renaissance.
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.960]  Now, why did the oligarchs of 500 years ago, the royal families in the church, not like
[37:08.960 --> 37:09.960]  it then?
[37:09.960 --> 37:13.120]  Because there were scientists that said the earth wasn't the center of the universe and
[37:13.120 --> 37:14.120]  they didn't like that.
[37:14.120 --> 37:17.840]  Nowadays, we like to think America is the center of the universe or something, but the point
[37:17.840 --> 37:18.840]  is it's not.
[37:18.840 --> 37:23.800]  So you had a bunch of oligarchs and special interests that wanted to be in total control
[37:23.800 --> 37:28.080]  like North Korea where people think that Kim Jong-un makes the sun come up in the morning
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.280]  while he's hanging out with Dennis Rodman and other bizarre behaviors.
[37:32.280 --> 37:37.820]  It doesn't matter, though, because there was a free market of ideas that began to develop
[37:37.820 --> 37:39.920]  in Europe.
[37:39.920 --> 37:47.320]  The dark age from Japan to Germany began to end 500 years ago, roughly, you guys give
[37:47.320 --> 37:49.000]  me the day to the Gutenberg.
[37:49.000 --> 37:55.280]  I think it's 14 late 14s, if I'm right, maybe 15 or at least I forget.
[37:55.280 --> 37:56.280]  Let's just see.
[37:56.280 --> 38:00.560]  I wouldn't win jeopardy is the point, but let's let's just pull it up, but that's established
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.160]  by most historians that the Gutenberg press, the printing press, is the mark of the beginning
[38:06.160 --> 38:08.040]  of the Renaissance.
[38:08.040 --> 38:11.480]  So the elites, the royalty, the church, they're all worried about it.
[38:11.480 --> 38:12.880]  What do they do?
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.080]  They begin to try to use licenses and other things to control the new Renaissance.
[38:17.080 --> 38:19.120]  They try to take control of society.
[38:19.120 --> 38:25.560]  They fund Malthus and they fund Galton and they fund Eugenics in the last 200 years.
[38:25.560 --> 38:31.280]  So there's competing oligarch systems and oligarch formulas of control and monopolies
[38:31.280 --> 38:34.720]  versus free market open systems.
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.080]  Now they've just used the last 100 years, the incredible large s, the glut of goods
[38:39.080 --> 38:43.080]  and services and media to create a decadent slob class.
[38:43.080 --> 38:48.480]  I'm part of it, though I'm on the upper end of being awakened and involved and caring
[38:48.480 --> 38:49.480]  and dynamic.
[38:49.480 --> 38:54.160]  I'm still a giant walrus-like slob compared to my forebears.
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.400]  So you've got a world of walrus-like slobs in the West, too lazy to have children, too
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.160]  lazy to have a destiny, too lazy to even want anything in the future, versus the starving
[39:03.160 --> 39:07.880]  murdered third world population and you've got the tiny technocrats above that in their
[39:07.880 --> 39:15.040]  own words who've decided that when they go to Whole Foods or they go to the shopping
[39:15.040 --> 39:19.640]  mall or they go to the airport, they don't like crowds of people and they don't like
[39:19.640 --> 39:22.120]  how stupid and ignorant and self-centered you are.
[39:22.120 --> 39:23.880]  They're self-centered but they know the game plan.
[39:23.880 --> 39:32.360]  They were smart enough to run credit default swap scams and other derivatives frauds and
[39:32.360 --> 39:37.000]  they were happy to have subprime bubble scams and I've got some of their quotes today.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.600]  Those very billionaires are in the news at Davos saying you don't need air conditioning
[39:41.600 --> 39:49.480]  or a car, not in Africa like Obama said last year, but in America and they're going to
[39:49.480 --> 39:57.760]  take everything you've got and transfer that money to themselves to live like no kings
[39:57.760 --> 40:01.360]  ever lived before on steroids.
[40:01.360 --> 40:02.360]  And you know what?
[40:02.360 --> 40:05.880]  They've learned through social engineering, you're going to enjoy it and it has nothing
[40:05.880 --> 40:09.880]  to do with saving the earth but they do look at seven and a half billion people and all
[40:09.880 --> 40:14.400]  the resources that are being used and they see those as their resources and so billionaire
[40:14.400 --> 40:20.920]  lectures serves in Davos, America's lifestyle expectations are far too high, close quote.
[40:20.920 --> 40:25.920]  If you listen closely this morning you could hear as humanity vomit as JP Morgan's CEO
[40:25.920 --> 40:33.120]  Jamie Dimon began to speak at Davos who flew there in a $100 million jet with a huge entourage
[40:33.120 --> 40:39.800]  of four other aircraft, which hey, great, you know, and he gets jumps to go out and
[40:39.800 --> 40:43.960]  get balloon mortgages and then he goes out and gets the government to bail it out and
[40:43.960 --> 40:49.120]  then he sits there when the government bails out JP Morgan, he then lectures the government
[40:49.120 --> 40:53.720]  who's now a debtor to JP Morgan for bailing them out.
[40:53.720 --> 40:58.120]  See how that works?
[40:58.120 --> 40:59.120]  Here's another one.
[40:59.120 --> 41:05.160]  Al Gore spends $90 trillion to ban cars from every major city in the world daily caller
[41:05.160 --> 41:13.360]  and it's got his quotes and the GCEC study that says just ban cars entirely because the
[41:13.360 --> 41:19.720]  elite fly helicopters anyways and then just charge you so much for a 200 square foot apartment
[41:19.720 --> 41:21.800]  that's the equivalent of a 10,000 square foot house.
[41:21.800 --> 41:22.800]  I'm not joking.
[41:22.800 --> 41:23.800]  These are real actuaries.
[41:23.800 --> 41:24.800]  Why not?
[41:24.800 --> 41:27.080]  The public will put up with it.
[41:27.080 --> 41:33.960]  If you have some simpering person with a NPR voice, you know, with cornrows or, you know,
[41:33.960 --> 41:37.720]  with their pants hanging down over their butt or some kind of trendy outfit, you know,
[41:37.720 --> 41:44.120]  with a John Lennon shirt on, people do whatever they're told, if they're told it's trendy.
[41:44.120 --> 41:46.520]  It's not a fascist world government takeover.
[41:46.520 --> 41:49.800]  It's not a plan to cut off resources to third world that'll kill a billion people
[41:49.800 --> 41:52.440]  conservatively in the next 10 years according to many metrics.
[41:52.440 --> 41:59.160]  It is the most trendy, cool thing ever heard of in the world to be poor and to pay for
[41:59.160 --> 42:04.480]  a tiny car which you would previously pay, you know, for the finest Mercedes.
[42:04.480 --> 42:08.560]  You want a motorcycle on four wheels, it's a 10 cam, it's incredibly dangerous and everything
[42:08.560 --> 42:09.560]  else.
[42:09.560 --> 42:12.680]  Oh, it's for the earth, blah, blah, while they block real innovation and all the other
[42:12.680 --> 42:15.720]  clean technologies that are out there.
[42:15.720 --> 42:16.720]  Here it is.
[42:16.720 --> 42:21.240]  Obama seeks to put Alaska Refuge that's 90% of the state off limits to drilling while
[42:21.240 --> 42:24.800]  he gives the state of the union speech last week claiming that he wants us to be energy
[42:24.800 --> 42:25.800]  independent.
[42:25.800 --> 42:27.640]  So there you go.
[42:27.640 --> 42:33.880]  Al Gore's got something like 10 houses, one of them is 40,000 square feet or something.
[42:33.880 --> 42:36.000]  But you shouldn't be able to have a house.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.600]  Just remember that.
[42:38.600 --> 42:39.600]  So this is the plan.
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.760]  And when we come back, before I get to other news, I'll put the phones up to your calls.
[42:43.760 --> 42:49.400]  I want to talk about the difference between a free market system, a renaissance system
[42:49.400 --> 42:54.480]  and a crony capitalist collectivist system on the other side because this is the whole
[42:54.480 --> 42:55.480]  ball game.
[42:55.480 --> 43:00.160]  This is how the world really works, folks, don't you want to know?
[43:00.160 --> 43:03.840]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[43:03.840 --> 43:08.200]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[43:08.200 --> 43:10.200]  Can you put two and two together?
[43:10.200 --> 43:15.800]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[43:15.800 --> 43:17.820]  priced and fully legal.
[43:17.820 --> 43:18.920]  But for how long?
[43:18.920 --> 43:25.880]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[43:25.880 --> 43:28.520]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.240]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[43:33.240 --> 43:38.320]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[43:38.320 --> 43:41.640]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[43:41.640 --> 43:46.920]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[44:18.360 --> 44:21.240]  Prime Directive, big credit, Alex Jones.
[44:21.240 --> 44:23.760]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[44:23.760 --> 44:27.080]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[44:27.080 --> 44:29.280]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[44:29.280 --> 44:31.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  They are never going to stop.
[44:35.000 --> 44:39.680]  They are never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[45:25.880 --> 45:30.880]  most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.040]  of herbal immunity.
[45:32.040 --> 45:36.200]  For the last two years, our team has been working with top doctors, nutritionists and
[45:36.200 --> 45:41.840]  chemists to develop the ultimate nutraceutical formulation, experience the benefits of combining

[45:59.040 --> 46:03.640]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,
[46:03.640 --> 46:08.040]  the exclusive Infowars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[46:08.040 --> 46:12.440]  This ultra-clean, vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over
[46:12.440 --> 46:17.120]  the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs
[46:17.120 --> 46:18.720]  essential nutrients.
[46:18.720 --> 46:24.040]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[46:24.040 --> 46:25.200]  by the body.
[46:25.200 --> 46:32.120]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutromedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin,
[46:32.120 --> 46:37.320]  the same kind used in B12 injections and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form
[46:37.320 --> 46:40.120]  that has been created with our proprietary process.
[46:40.120 --> 46:43.000]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue and then swallowed.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.720]  No needles, no injections.
[46:44.720 --> 46:46.000]  Don't take my word for it.
[46:46.000 --> 46:47.480]  Try it for yourself.
[46:47.480 --> 46:48.480]  Discover the secret.
[46:48.480 --> 46:49.480]  Secret 12.
[46:49.480 --> 46:51.840]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[47:02.040 --> 47:07.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:07.360 --> 47:21.920]  In the Councils of Government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted implants,
[47:21.920 --> 47:26.720]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commonwealth.
[47:26.720 --> 47:31.640]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[47:31.640 --> 47:32.640]  Dallas.
[47:32.640 --> 47:38.640]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[47:38.640 --> 47:42.640]  It is a big idea, a new order.
[47:42.640 --> 47:52.640]  It was almost as if we were planned in force to get just banked.
[47:52.640 --> 48:01.640]  Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[48:01.640 --> 48:14.640]  But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers
[48:14.640 --> 48:18.640]  not in the hands of criminals.
[48:18.640 --> 48:19.640]  Criminals might hear them.
[48:19.640 --> 48:20.640]  Guns will be taken.
[48:20.640 --> 48:21.640]  No one will be able to be off.
[48:21.640 --> 48:22.640]  We can take all of them.
[48:22.640 --> 48:27.640]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[48:27.640 --> 48:28.640]  city.
[48:28.640 --> 48:40.640]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[48:40.640 --> 48:47.640]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[48:47.640 --> 48:53.640]  Yeah, there was that short clip of CNBC, the central bankers are in charge, we're all just
[48:53.640 --> 48:54.640]  their slaves.
[48:54.640 --> 48:59.640]  And again, people have been taught you're either a communist or you're a right-winger.
[48:59.640 --> 49:02.640]  Because that's what the left says.
[49:02.640 --> 49:05.640]  Oh, we're socialists, but you study what they do.
[49:05.640 --> 49:12.640]  Lean forward and all those MSNBC slogans are like Marxist-Leninist famous slogans.
[49:12.640 --> 49:20.640]  If you're informed, you look at it, you go, oh my God, it's Engels, it's Marx, it's Lenin.
[49:20.640 --> 49:22.640]  But it's not.
[49:22.640 --> 49:27.640]  It's just big megabanks that control governments and issue the money.
[49:27.640 --> 49:29.640]  They can buy everything up.
[49:29.640 --> 49:33.640]  So they don't like free market because you end up owning your own property, you end up
[49:33.640 --> 49:34.640]  owning your own factory.
[49:34.640 --> 49:38.640]  They want you on government welfare or they want you with a government loan.
[49:38.640 --> 49:39.640]  They want to run your life.
[49:39.640 --> 49:43.640]  They're the opposite of a Renaissance economy, 500 years old.
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.640]  They're the old system of serfdom, of feudalism, of control.
[49:48.640 --> 49:56.640]  And they dress it up in little nice little black ladies like MSNBC in little pink dresses
[49:56.640 --> 49:58.640]  going, oh, communism's good.
[49:58.640 --> 50:00.640]  Oh, we love the children.
[50:00.640 --> 50:07.640]  Or nice little white guys in little suits to appeal to everybody.
[50:07.640 --> 50:12.640]  And they come on there and say your kids belong to the state and other just over-the-top statements
[50:12.640 --> 50:17.640]  to get us all fighting with each other.
[50:17.640 --> 50:24.640]  While the decision has been made, and I just read a couple mainstream headlines, that you
[50:24.640 --> 50:25.640]  can't have anything.
[50:25.640 --> 50:27.640]  You've got to be totally poor.
[50:27.640 --> 50:28.640]  Humans are bad.
[50:28.640 --> 50:31.640]  And they're not even saying that because humans might be hurting the earth.
[50:31.640 --> 50:38.640]  They're just saying it so they can swindle more of your money and jack up your taxes and
[50:38.640 --> 50:39.640]  exempt themselves.
[50:39.640 --> 50:42.640]  You see, they've set up a global government where they leave the nation states.
[50:42.640 --> 50:47.640]  There's a global corporate government with all these secret treaties on record.
[50:47.640 --> 50:49.640]  And then you get the treaties decades later.
[50:49.640 --> 50:51.640]  They're all exempt from taxes.
[50:51.640 --> 50:58.640]  See, if they weren't exempt from the taxes being this high, you would have lower taxes
[50:58.640 --> 51:00.640]  because they'd be under the same ones.
[51:00.640 --> 51:02.640]  It's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.640]  That's why they scream racism, racism, sexism, sexism all day.
[51:06.640 --> 51:12.640]  So we're all looking for signs of a black person being racist, or a white person being racist,
[51:12.640 --> 51:18.640]  or a Hispanic being racist, or a man not treating a woman right, or vice versa, or oh my gosh,
[51:18.640 --> 51:20.640]  you men are urinating, standing up.
[51:20.640 --> 51:21.640]  Let's arrest them in Germany.
[51:21.640 --> 51:22.640]  I'm not joking.
[51:22.640 --> 51:25.640]  I've got that in the stack.
[51:25.640 --> 51:30.640]  Well, meanwhile, we're being engineered.
[51:30.640 --> 51:31.640]  We're being enslaved.
[51:31.640 --> 51:34.640]  We're having our basic freedoms annihilated.
[51:34.640 --> 51:40.640]  In every club of Rome, council on foreign relations, trilateral commission,
[51:40.640 --> 51:42.640]  Devo's Switzerland speech.
[51:42.640 --> 51:44.640]  I was watching Devo's on C-SPAN yesterday.
[51:44.640 --> 51:46.640]  And I just randomly turned it on.
[51:46.640 --> 51:50.640]  They had some global EU banker saying we've got a lower standard of living,
[51:50.640 --> 51:52.640]  and we've got to get rid of families.
[51:52.640 --> 51:54.640]  And he just, oh yeah, that's a great idea.
[51:54.640 --> 51:56.640]  To fund government, you need families.
[51:56.640 --> 51:59.640]  You need 2.1 children being born.
[51:59.640 --> 52:01.640]  We're 1.5.
[52:01.640 --> 52:04.640]  And is all this Greek or Martian to people?
[52:04.640 --> 52:06.640]  The West is already gone.
[52:06.640 --> 52:12.640]  Japan has 1.2 kids for every two adults.
[52:12.640 --> 52:15.640]  And idiots always send me emails and say,
[52:15.640 --> 52:17.640]  I can't believe you can even send emails.
[52:17.640 --> 52:19.640]  What do you mean 1.3 kids?
[52:19.640 --> 52:20.640]  You don't have 1.3.
[52:20.640 --> 52:22.640]  You either have one kid or you don't.
[52:22.640 --> 52:26.640]  We're talking about aggregate millions here.
[52:26.640 --> 52:31.640]  Is the public so far gone it's just all over?
[52:31.640 --> 52:33.640]  I mean, is that what it's come down to?
[52:33.640 --> 52:36.640]  That you really want to just be engineered and learn how football works
[52:36.640 --> 52:39.640]  or how to act cool, but not how the world works?
[52:39.640 --> 52:43.640]  You know, all the sports scores go on back 50 years.
[52:43.640 --> 52:46.640]  And the baseball scores and what type of underwear?
[52:46.640 --> 52:48.640]  Mickey Mantlewar or Babe Ruth.
[52:48.640 --> 52:55.640]  Who cares whether the footballs were inflated or not?
[52:55.640 --> 52:57.640]  Does Obamacare increase your prices?
[52:57.640 --> 52:59.640]  Does it create death panels?
[52:59.640 --> 53:01.640]  You should take that personal because it does
[53:01.640 --> 53:06.640]  and now you're experiencing it.
[53:06.640 --> 53:09.640]  So they want a world government not based on free market
[53:09.640 --> 53:12.640]  but by government regulations that are selectively enforced
[53:12.640 --> 53:16.640]  to shut down all the competition
[53:16.640 --> 53:19.640]  and to put in tax incentives where Germany last year
[53:19.640 --> 53:25.640]  outlawed single families the word homes.
[53:25.640 --> 53:28.640]  You must live in big dormitories with a watchman
[53:28.640 --> 53:31.640]  that controls your life and social workers on every floor.
[53:31.640 --> 53:39.640]  I mean, this is hell that's being created.
[53:39.640 --> 53:43.640]  This is totalitarianism, but it's only allowed
[53:43.640 --> 53:48.640]  because there is a 1-tenth of 1% that wants people to attack the 1%.
[53:48.640 --> 53:52.640]  Now, if you look at it, about half the wealth is owned
[53:52.640 --> 53:54.640]  by a tiny fraction of the 1%.
[53:54.640 --> 53:57.640]  And they're waging war against the 20%.
[53:57.640 --> 54:00.640]  It's a middle class that 30 years ago in the U.S.,
[54:00.640 --> 54:04.640]  the numbers came out last week, was about 35%, 40%.
[54:04.640 --> 54:06.640]  The middle class is gone.
[54:06.640 --> 54:09.640]  And Obama gives all these speeches about middle class all day.
[54:09.640 --> 54:11.640]  Oh, KUT in Austin.
[54:11.640 --> 54:13.640]  Look, tiny apartments could be answered
[54:13.640 --> 54:15.640]  to Austin's housing crunch.
[54:15.640 --> 54:18.640]  Oh, but they charge you more per square foot for them.
[54:18.640 --> 54:20.640]  See, it's artificial scarcity.
[54:20.640 --> 54:22.640]  You don't get a little apartment and get it cheap.
[54:22.640 --> 54:25.640]  No, they just teach you to have less
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.640]  so the governing class can have a bigger piece of tax pie.
[54:29.640 --> 54:31.640]  And so more people can work for government
[54:31.640 --> 54:33.640]  or corporations that have government contracts
[54:33.640 --> 54:36.640]  so that the globalists can socially control you
[54:36.640 --> 54:39.640]  through that paycheck.
[54:39.640 --> 54:43.640]  The end of the Renaissance, the return of the Dark Age
[54:43.640 --> 54:48.640]  with a high-tech surveillance grid overlay
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.640]  that is a technotronic Armageddon.
[54:52.640 --> 54:55.640]  Look at these headlines.
[54:55.640 --> 54:58.640]  Harvard professor, government mosquito drone
[54:58.640 --> 55:00.640]  will extract your DNA.
[55:00.640 --> 55:02.640]  You know, I see all these wild things on air
[55:02.640 --> 55:04.640]  that I've read from Davos over the last decade.
[55:04.640 --> 55:06.640]  It's just all from them.
[55:06.640 --> 55:08.640]  Harvard professor, Margo Seltzer,
[55:08.640 --> 55:10.640]  warned that miniature mosquito drones
[55:10.640 --> 55:12.640]  will one day forcibly extract your DNA
[55:12.640 --> 55:14.640]  on behalf of government insurance companies
[55:14.640 --> 55:17.640]  as she told scientists the World Economic Forum in Davos
[55:17.640 --> 55:19.640]  that privacy was dead.
[55:19.640 --> 55:21.640]  Well, yeah, they're already putting in all the cars,
[55:21.640 --> 55:24.640]  tracker boxes that tax you by the mile in the last 15 years
[55:24.640 --> 55:26.640]  and now they announced this year they're going to go live
[55:26.640 --> 55:28.640]  with them and start taxing.
[55:28.640 --> 55:30.640]  It's already begun in like eight cities.
[55:30.640 --> 55:32.640]  Seltzer professor in computer science
[55:32.640 --> 55:34.640]  at Harvard University told attendees,
[55:34.640 --> 55:37.640]  privacy as we knew it in part is no longer feasible
[55:37.640 --> 55:40.640]  how we continually think of privacy as dead.
[55:40.640 --> 55:42.640]  Oh, it's like a warning. No, it's not.
[55:42.640 --> 55:44.640]  It's we will assimilate you, resist this futile.
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.640]  That's what this announcement is.
[55:49.640 --> 55:51.640]  I remember like 12 years ago, Bill Gates came out
[55:51.640 --> 55:53.640]  and was already creating mosquitoes that have vaccines
[55:53.640 --> 55:55.640]  in them that are biological mosquitoes
[55:55.640 --> 55:57.640]  and people didn't believe me when I was reading
[55:57.640 --> 55:59.640]  from his own think tanks website.
[55:59.640 --> 56:01.640]  Now, let's continue down this line.
[56:01.640 --> 56:04.640]  This is a biz pack review article that links
[56:04.640 --> 56:07.640]  through the Arizona State University
[56:07.640 --> 56:11.640]  and local TV.
[56:11.640 --> 56:14.640]  This is a real headline. I didn't make this up.
[56:14.640 --> 56:16.640]  Hating Whitey close quote.
[56:16.640 --> 56:20.640]  Arizona State stirs pot teaching the problem of white classes.
[56:20.640 --> 56:22.640]  Well, don't worry. Just the last two weeks
[56:22.640 --> 56:25.640]  over a hundred white people were killed confirmed
[56:25.640 --> 56:27.640]  because they were white in the U.S.
[56:27.640 --> 56:29.640]  but it's only in local news though who cares.
[56:29.640 --> 56:31.640]  They deserve to die. They're white.
[56:31.640 --> 56:35.640]  College student in Arizona can now take a class on hating Whitey
[56:35.640 --> 56:38.640]  and to learn the quote problem of whiteness
[56:38.640 --> 56:40.640]  and it goes through that whites are inherently
[56:40.640 --> 56:42.640]  an evil on the earth.
[56:42.640 --> 56:45.640]  This funded by the mega elite to control everything
[56:45.640 --> 56:47.640]  just to get us all fighting with each other.
[56:47.640 --> 56:50.640]  Here's another one from info wars.com Kurt Nemo.
[56:50.640 --> 56:52.640]  He links through to the German newspapers.
[56:52.640 --> 56:53.640]  You can't make this up.
[56:53.640 --> 56:55.640]  I remember covering this last year.
[56:55.640 --> 56:58.640]  German court rules man can urinate while standing up.
[56:58.640 --> 57:01.640]  Feminist groups had claimed that men urinating standing up
[57:01.640 --> 57:04.640]  was a privilege over women and was an act of male dominance.
[57:04.640 --> 57:11.640]  But a court has ruled that they will not pay a 2,855 pound damage
[57:11.640 --> 57:14.640]  for a feminist landowner apartment owner
[57:14.640 --> 57:19.640]  that said that her male renters might splatter on the seat.
[57:19.640 --> 57:21.640]  But remember last year, Michelle Obama said,
[57:21.640 --> 57:24.640]  don't say the word bossy because feminists aren't bossy.
[57:24.640 --> 57:26.640]  No, what you are is a bunch of hard-court
[57:26.640 --> 57:29.640]  to talitarian scumbags that want to control reality
[57:29.640 --> 57:32.640]  and lecture us how to live and operate while telling women
[57:32.640 --> 57:34.640]  that they shouldn't have a man in the house
[57:34.640 --> 57:36.640]  so they're alone and the state's their husband
[57:36.640 --> 57:38.640]  and a woman shouldn't have a gun.
[57:38.640 --> 57:40.640]  Well, you know what? Everybody's done with you
[57:40.640 --> 57:42.640]  and we know who you are, Phil.
[57:42.640 --> 57:44.640]  And it's declassified. You're CIA funded.
[57:44.640 --> 57:46.640]  Second hour coming up. Will peace standing up?
[57:46.640 --> 58:13.640]  You can go to hell.
[58:16.640 --> 58:18.640]  3-3-1-3-9.
[58:46.640 --> 58:48.640]  Just won't quit.

[59:51.640 --> 59:55.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.640]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines,
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.640]  the information war continues.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.640]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.640]  I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.640]  eleven, twelve stacks I've gotten to.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.640]  Sunday is usually about half the stacks.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.640]  So I didn't spend an hour on the global mindset
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.640]  and the technocracy and the plan to rob everybody's rights
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.640]  because I didn't have news to cover.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.640]  We will intersperse the news, but I want to take your phone calls.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.640]  But if you don't understand the globalist mindset,
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.640]  you have no hope.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.640]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:47.640]  And I sit here living in this live science fiction dystopian movie
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.640]  being a successful member of society.
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.640]  And I realize how they actuary the tyranny on the poor people first,
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:59.640]  but I see the water rising on the island I'm living on
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.640]  and I have empathy for those being enslaved by this.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:11.640]  I realize this is a planned program in their own words.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:17.640]  And are we just going to roll over to a bunch of scum like Al Gore?
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:22.640]  Are we really going to play ball with these people?
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.640]  I've heard about feminist in public schools years ago.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.640]  I didn't believe this when I first heard about it like 20 years ago.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.640]  I'll hear about it on conservative talk radio because they cover this.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:37.640]  And I think the feminist aren't trying to make boys in elementary school
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.640]  and then in high school P sitting because it makes girls feel bad.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.640]  And I went and looked it up and they actually do that.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.640]  I mean, these people want to tell you how to urinate.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.640]  That is the definition of a control freak.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.640]  I mean, I can't make this up.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.640]  And these people are in control and relish telling us what to do.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:08.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.640]  And you're going to give us prozac.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640]  You're going to put floor on the water.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.640]  You're going to shoot the babies up with all the vaccines
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.640]  and watch them have a convulsion and never talk again
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.640]  and be in diapers for the rest of their life
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.640]  because you're a bunch of murdering, sick control freaks.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.640]  God, you people are trash.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.640]  And you've got all these blind sheeple that are better people than you.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.640]  They're just naive about who you are
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.640]  because they think the rest of the world is like them
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.640]  who are like lambs in the slaughter.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.640]  Let me give you a little newsflash.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.640]  And I've given this analogy hundreds of times
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.640]  before it was in the movie American Sniper.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.640]  I am not a wolf and I'm not a sheep.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.640]  I am a vicious, giant, mean sheepdog.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.640]  And I hate you.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.640]  And I politically, I'm going to get my jaws around your neck
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.640]  and I don't care what the other wolves would you do.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.640]  I'm going to crunch down with a look of extreme pleasure in my eyeballs.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.640]  In fact, I've already done that.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.640]  And I look to chomp down even harder.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.640]  I don't care how you attack me.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.640]  I don't care what you do.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.640]  The feeling of freedom committing against you
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.640]  is my soul lines up with it and just says bingo.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.640]  Bingo. This is what you're supposed to be doing.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.640]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away from this fight.
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.640]  And that's why I want to encourage everybody out there
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.640]  to be afraid of tyranny, so afraid of getting on a list,
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.640]  so afraid of being demonized.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.640]  You get attacked on CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times,
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.640]  The Washington Post, The L.A. Times,
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.640]  and a thousand other publications.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.640]  It is a red badge of honor.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.640]  It is good to be attacked by this scum.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.640]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.640]  First-time callers in the first round of calls.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.640]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.640]  877-789-2539.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:59.640]  And we'll get you up and on the air again.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:06.640]  First-time callers, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.640]  Well, we're lining those calls up.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.640]  We got a bunch of epic videos and things to play.
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.640]  We'll get to all of them when we come back after this quick break.
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:21.640]  But reality is so much more incredible than what Madison Avenue
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:27.640]  and Wall Street and Hollywood and the Times Square mentality
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.640]  can even imagine.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.640]  The world is so much bigger than just dominating fellow humans
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.640]  and treating them like chattel,
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.640]  like bricks to build a wall of enslavement.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.640]  Humanity are burning souls ready to be empowered,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.640]  ready to be turned loose, ready to be empowered,
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.640]  ready to be...
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.640]  Given the universe,
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.640]  then that's what these tyrants seek to shudder
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:05:16.640]  and they will fail and humanity will crash.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:32.640]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.640]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.640]  with super male or super female vitality,
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.640]  specifically designed to assist the body
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.640]  in regulating proper hormone balance
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.640]  to create superior vitality in males and females.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.640]  Supercharge and conquer your world
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:58.640]  at n4slife.com or call 1-88-253-3139.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:21.640]  It is only fitting that a free screen should sound the alarm against those who would destroy freedom.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:33.640]  When it's hard to deceive and inflame or enlighten and inspire, the motion picture has no equal.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.640]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:38.640]  This is the Sunday Broadcast.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.640]  We're here every Sunday,
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.640]  every single Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.640]  and sometimes owns in Europe.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.640]  I guess that would be 3 to 5 in the east,
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.640]  4 to 6 in the central,
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.640]  that'd be 3 to 5 in the mountain,
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:07.640]  and that'd be, I guess, 2 to 4 in the Pacific.
[01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.640]  We are going to be taking your phone calls
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.640]  on all the different issues I threw out in the first hour
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.640]  and going over a lot of other news,
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.640]  there is a global group of private corporations that are insiders
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.640]  that work through private central banks
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.640]  who have unlimited currency and credit by fraud
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.640]  who are waging war against real free market economies
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.640]  and have decided to phase out the free market economy
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.640]  first the industrial economy, then the service economy
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.640]  and make us basically chattel welfare slaves
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.640]  either through corporate government or classical welfare systems
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.640]  to make us dependent so that we can go under true social engineering
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.640]  for population reduction and final extermination.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.640]  And that's a huge statement there and it's totally true.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.640]  And I'm just here warning you,
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.640]  and there's enough freedom and free speech left in the west
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.640]  that I'm able to even get this out.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.640]  The system thinks you're done,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.640]  they think you've rolled over to anything.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640]  In Germany, like I mentioned,
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640]  they're trying to ban men standing up and urinating,
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.640]  that's illegal.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.640]  With a straight face, they say it hurts women,
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.640]  they can't stand and urinate.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.640]  And if a woman can't do it, you shouldn't be able to do it.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.640]  That's equality, that's tolerance.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.640]  And state-run universities in Arizona
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.640]  are teaching all the problems are because of white people.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.640]  And I mentioned that last hour.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.640]  And you hear this stuff and it sounds crazy,
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.640]  it's meant to be crazy.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.640]  Like Obama saying two plus two equals five
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.640]  it doesn't raise the debt.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.640]  This is all meant to get you ready
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.640]  to put up with anything they say.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.640]  MSNBC saying your kids don't belong to you,
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.640]  they belong to the state.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.640]  Should I play that clip again?
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.640]  CBS News saying fluoride is good for your kids
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.640]  or mercury is good for your kids.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.640]  I can play all these clips again.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.640]  We all know fluoride will kill you,
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.640]  we all know mercury will kill you,
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.640]  but it's part of them just,
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:03.640]  hey, pay us carbon taxes,
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.640]  even though plants live off carbon dioxide
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.640]  the Earth's the coldest it's ever been,
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.640]  NASA said last week,
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.640]  even though we've got record cold temperatures
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.640]  across the planet, acu-weather,
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.640]  Tuesday blizzard to bring New York City,
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.640]  Boston to stand still,
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.640]  the mayor of New York says maybe the worst to ever hit.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.640]  Meanwhile, more homeless camps
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.640]  are appearing beyond downtown L.A.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.640]  Skid Row,
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.640]  L.A. Times reports,
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.640]  but they claim California is the best economy ever.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.640]  Okay.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.640]  And they're open on the board,
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.640]  the board is wide open.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.640]  Let me go further here
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.640]  before I go to your phone calls.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.640]  When the president,
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.640]  without even an executive order,
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.640]  but just by fiat, opens the borders up
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.640]  and legalizes all the illegals
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.640]  or turns off our power plants
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.640]  or puts our military under U.N. control
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.640]  or persecutes the Tea Party
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.640]  or the Christian groups or the IRS,
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.640]  do you understand if they get away with that,
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.640]  they can do anything?
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.640]  And Congress
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:03.640]  passed in the House last year
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.640]  a ban on partial birth abortion.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.640]  They couldn't even do it
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.640]  now that the Republicans have a bigger majority.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.640]  You know why?
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.640]  Because before the Republican House could pass the bill
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.640]  and blame it on the Democrats
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.640]  voting it down on the Senate.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.640]  But now that it came down
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.640]  to actually banning partial birth abortion
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.640]  of eight and nine month old babies,
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.640]  they could be just delivered
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.640]  and adopted on the spot.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.640]  Now the true
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.640]  unequivocal murder could have been banned.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.640]  The House couldn't
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.640]  pass it.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.640]  To see that would have exposed the Senate
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.640]  that now has a Republican majority as traders.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.640]  So see, electing more Republicans
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.640]  means we can't pass
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.640]  abortion bans.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.640]  Because it shows you who the wolves
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.640]  in sheep's clothing are.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.640]  That's good though.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.640]  You had a major political realignment
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.640]  Democrats voting for Republicans.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.640]  Because they wanted to get the economy going.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:01.640]  They were against abortion.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.640]  They were against open borders.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.640]  When you give the illegals all this free stuff
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.640]  but you can't get that if you go to a third world country
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.640]  they can come here but we can't go there.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.640]  Everybody gets it.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.640]  And so because we are winning hearts and minds
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.640]  because people are waking up
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.640]  to what's happening.
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:21.640]  Now
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.640]  Boehner
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.640]  who attacks Obama in speeches
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.640]  I predict that it wasn't hard to do.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.640]  He won't though even start
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.640]  or allow the bills.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.640]  There's dozens of them to repeal parts
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.640]  or all of Obamacare.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.640]  That's totally unpopular, totally criminal.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.640]  Has death panels, increases prices.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.640]  Has all these taxes on poor people.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.640]  Can't happen.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.640]  Can't have an IRS
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.640]  investigation of them persecuting people.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.640]  That's all admitted.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.640]  Can't have a Benghazi investigation.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.640]  Can't have a fast and furious investigation.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.640]  Because people like John Boehner
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640]  are set to make tens of millions a year
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.640]  just on their insurance company investments
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.640]  they voted on.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.640]  And just in 2014 insurance company
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.640]  profits
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.640]  worldwide
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.640]  were up
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.640]  47% just off US profits.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.640]  And if you look at just US subsidiaries
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.640]  they're up 200
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:21.640]  plus percent. Look it up.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.640]  That guys, people won't believe me if they're a TV viewer.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.640]  Infowars.com for its last show
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.640]  just to obnoxiously show everything
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.640]  that we talk about on screen.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:31.640]  Type in insurance company profits up
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]  47% under Obamacare.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.640]  Let's give them a New York Times or Wall Street Journal
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.640]  on that one.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.640]  But it's 200 plus percent just here
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.640]  because gang raping you
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.640]  is fun for them.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.640]  The dumbasses that were out there
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.640]  and supported Excuse My French
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.640]  really thought
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.640]  that the government and insurance companies
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.640]  that were lobbying for it wanted to give you
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.640]  increased
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.640]  at afforded slip lowered prices
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.640]  or wanted to give you something free.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.640]  And you got all these poor people out there
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.640]  that never knew they could get charity care
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.640]  or free healthcare under federal law
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.640]  at these hospitals, these charity hospitals.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.640]  They're all lined up around the block bankrupting things right now.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.640]  Like it's some kind of new
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.640]  fancy rich guy thing
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.640]  to go in and get surgery or whatever
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.640]  in these flesh eating bacteria factories
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.640]  they call hospitals.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.640]  And our country's media
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.640]  is so controlled
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.640]  that even Forbes admitted
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.640]  there are bullet cases around the country
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.640]  that have been covered up.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.640]  That's what it is to be a slave though.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.640]  A slave to the complexity.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.640]  Because most men that are intelligent
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.640]  decide to go game the system
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.640]  somewhere where they can make money
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.640]  gaming the system.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.640]  There's the New York Times
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.640]  cost of coverage under Affordable Care Act
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.640]  increases in 2015.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:53.640]  Yeah, that's an article about
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.640]  just Google, just search engine
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.640]  insurance companies get record profits
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.640]  under Obamacare. That'll give you the 47%
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.640]  2014 number.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.640]  That's globally though.
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.640]  Insurance companies globally
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.640]  47%
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.640]  increase.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.640]  They wrote the bill.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.640]  They had bipartisan Republican
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.640]  support and the Republicans won't repeal it
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.640]  right now.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.640]  But the Democrats will get up and say Republicans
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.640]  don't want it because they're racist.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.640]  They wrote the stinking thing.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.640]  The Rhino, Neocon, John
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.640]  Boehner pieces of trash
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.640]  wrote it.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.640]  With the Democrats
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.640]  like Ezekiel Emanuel who went on Fox
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.640]  News and said
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.640]  yeah, this is meant to bankrupt
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.640]  health care and bring in total control in a single
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.640]  payer that'll still be administered though
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.640]  by private interest.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.640]  When they're done, you'll pay five times
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.640]  what you did and then they'll deny you
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.640]  care and you're going to love it
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.640]  because you don't even have a memory
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.640]  of your new listener out there of how your
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:55.640]  prices went up. Yeah, there's Forbes headline
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.640]  profits and health insurance
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.640]  under Obama
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.640]  and then it goes into, that's
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.640]  a 2013 showing massive
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.640]  increase. I'll find it during the
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.640]  breaking show folks. You guys are doing great, but I'll
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.640]  find it because I covered it out of an
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.640]  AP article. There was a Japan
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.640]  Times article too last week
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640]  that said the 40, I think
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.640]  they said 49% actually in that article.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.640]  It's got to be
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.640]  fun though. You just go lobby
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.640]  and people like my folks or myself
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.640]  see a doubling
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.640]  the last two years on their prices
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.640]  but we're all just individuals.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.640]  We're all conspiracy theorists. You know, that's all
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.640]  just a Republican talking point
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.640]  even though they wrote the bill, the Republicans did.
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.640]  We're going to come back and take your phone calls
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.640]  and then we're going to look at what's happening in Greece,
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.640]  what's happening in China, big economic
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.640]  implosions there. Oh, X spies
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.640]  infiltrate Hollywood as espionage TV shows
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.640]  and movies multiply. That was the law change
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:51.640]  last year to allow the CIA to run the media.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  They were already doing it, but now the gloves are
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.640]  off. That's all coming
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.640]  up out of the Washington Post. Stay with us.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.640]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.640]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.640]  5 3 3 1 3 9
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.640]  5 3 3 1 3 9
