[00:00:01.628 --> 00:00:03.349]  We are on the march.
[00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:06.592]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:10.854]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:25.604]  I'm waiting in my cold cell When the bell begins to chime Reflecting Reflecting
[00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:35.852]  And it doesn't have much time.
[00:00:35.852 --> 00:00:45.717]  It's five o'clock, they take me to the gallows for the sands of time.
[00:00:45.717 --> 00:00:48.759]  For the human race.
[00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:52.261]  But I am the human race, so are you.
[00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:00.592]  We're not team players is the problem.
[00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.713]  Running low.
[00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:05.075]  Running low.
[00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.055]  Running low.
[00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:10.837]  Not hourglass.
[00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.918]  Running low.
[00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:20.982]  I guess my whole broadcast is a ghost of Armageddon's future.
[00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:26.645]  Attempting to warn the people as best I can about certain technocronic
[00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:33.187]  Hell on Earth that we face if we allow the psychopaths that control the planet to take over.
[00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:35.448]  Crank it back up!
[00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:37.108]  Powerful transmission.
[00:01:37.108 --> 00:01:38.968]  Is this just some crazy dream?
[00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:40.849]  When you realize...
[00:01:59.444 --> 00:02:02.246]  That life is about five minutes long in the scheme of things.
[00:02:02.246 --> 00:02:05.988]  It goes by so quickly.
[00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:08.930]  Then you realize you are always five minutes to midnight.
[00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.112]  You're always being marched to that gallows pool.
[00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:28.682]  Every time you put your children in an automobile, whether you live in South Africa, Mexico, or Germany, or Japan, or Russia, or the Straits of Hormuz, when you drive down that highway, it's the number one cause of death worldwide.
[00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:43.806]  But there's no fanfare, there's no fear-mongering, there's no Hollywood movies demonizing it so people are unaware of it, they just line up and happily commit to it.
[00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:47.107]  Because that's the human spirit, is not to be cowards.
[00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:54.210]  And to absolutely accept your environment when you have to live in it, but to change it and make it better.
[00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:02.074]  But what happens when the industrialization and the modernization and the
[00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:12.040]  Safety first public service angle becomes a poison cyanide lining.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.945]  What happens when the machine is possessed by a eugenics ghost?
[00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:18.725]  How do you fight that?
[00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:19.566]  How do you change that?
[00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:26.852]  There's a lot of different ways to do it.
[00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:31.016]  But the biggest and most important from my research and historical
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.381]  20 years fighting this toe-to-toe.
[00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:42.706]  You've got to believe in humanity and you've got to decide humanity's good.
[00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:46.248]  You've got to decide you want to build other people up.
[00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:49.610]  You've got to decide you want to be honorable.
[00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.634]  You've got to realize there is evil in this world and that it's running the show right now and that we're in a deep crisis.
[00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:06.976]  But most people just want to look fashionable, act cool, and have a good time, and they think they're unhappy because they're not having a big enough party.
[00:04:11.212 --> 00:04:19.139]  And all experience has shown that it is the animating contest of liberty that makes you happy, empowered, and great.
[00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:29.347]  The problem is, as I've said a thousand times, the great men and women that have delivered us to this current position are dead and gone.
[00:04:29.347 --> 00:04:30.688]  Dead and gone!
[00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:33.851]  Gone, gone, gone!
[00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:34.512]  And it's place
[00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:45.059]  The decadent slobs, the mightiest of us, weak compared to those that came before.
[00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:52.106]  Dishonored, fallen, clouching towards Gomorrah.
[00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:57.432]  There is a way to avert this great plan, but I have not the strength to loose it.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.761]  Alex Jones here.
[00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:08.934]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:14.181]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:18.202]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:05:18.202 --> 00:05:27.764]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:39.166]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:43.947]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:47.429]  With exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:06:19.365 --> 00:06:22.807]  From FEMA Region 6 in occupied North America.
[00:06:22.807 --> 00:06:24.068]  There is a war.
[00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:26.210]  It's happening now.
[00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.751]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:31.313]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:06:31.313 --> 00:06:33.235]  We are the resistance.
[00:06:33.235 --> 00:06:34.876]  We are the InfoWalk.
[00:06:36.823 --> 00:06:39.504]  Well, we've almost gone through the first month of the 2015.
[00:06:39.504 --> 00:06:40.564]  It's hard to believe.
[00:06:40.564 --> 00:06:45.065]  It is Sunday, the 25th day of January 2015.
[00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:47.306]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:50.687]  We'll be here as we are, live every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:52.728]  Central Standard Time.
[00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:58.289]  About once a month, David Knight, great InfoWars Nightly News anchor, hosts the Sunday Show.
[00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:04.611]  He does a great job and is becoming very, very popular with the listeners, which is a great thing because his
[00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:16.879]  Acumen and understanding of world events is right up there with mine and in some cases more informed than myself and many of the experts we have on the broadcast.
[00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.040]  I appreciate David Knight being here last Sunday.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.004]  I'm here, ladies and gentlemen, at 4.07 Central Standard Time.
[00:07:24.004 --> 00:07:27.306]  Many stations rebroadcast it in other time slots.
[00:07:27.306 --> 00:07:32.049]  We want to thank all of those affiliates, both the old affiliates and the new affiliates.
[00:07:32.049 --> 00:07:34.131]  I've been doing this syndicated radio broadcast
[00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:35.549]  For 20 years.
[00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:41.954]  And for about seven years, I've been broadcasting on Sundays.
[00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:53.036]  I figured that a lot of stations out there weren't ready to pick up the show weekdays, but if I could get them to try out the broadcast, that they would end up picking it up weekdays or weeknights, and that certainly happened.
[00:07:53.036 --> 00:08:04.878]  We went from about 70 affiliates seven years ago or so, 68, 70 something affiliates, and then with the Sunday show, almost every new affiliate we've gotten has picked up the Sunday show.
[00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:19.083]  They've gotten a lot of listener support, gotten good listenership, ratings, community support, and then they start putting us on re-aired at night, and then almost every station then, within about a year, ends up carrying us live during the day.
[00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:26.385]  On big stations, mom-and-pop stations, little stations, they're all precious of every size across the United States.
[00:08:26.385 --> 00:08:34.187]  Now, over 185 affiliates across the United States, over 100 carrying this Sunday broadcast, but you know,
[00:08:35.455 --> 00:08:38.477]  Stations come and stations go.
[00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:46.642]  They change formats, they change directions, and that's why it's always important to keep growing because as we gain stations, we lose stations.
[00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:52.525]  We've probably lost over 100 affiliates over the years that have switched to ESPN.
[00:08:52.525 --> 00:09:01.711]  I can't tell you how many times I've been on a station in Orlando or in Corpus Christi or in New York City or in Los Angeles or in St.
[00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:04.893]  Louis or in Minnesota.
[00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:06.933]  St.
[00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:10.054]  Paul, I remember, and we're on for a couple years, get great listenership.
[00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:12.035]  It's just that they sell or they change format.
[00:09:12.035 --> 00:09:13.516]  That's what happens.
[00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:18.057]  And that's why no one listening to this broadcast should take it for granted.
[00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:28.281]  Because these type of hardcore, pro-America, common sense, Americana, constitutional views are very popular.
[00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:29.682]  They are common sense.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.743]  But at the same time, the power structure and the entire system does not like to fund it.
[00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:46.108]  The establishment does not, to go out and raise $400 million a year, like they do for NPR, for True Libertarian Talk Radio.
[00:09:46.108 --> 00:09:53.492]  You don't have George Soros pumping billions of dollars into pro-liberty, pro-individual type media.
[00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:55.393]  It is you, the individual,
[00:09:56.314 --> 00:10:04.536]  That support the local sponsors, that support the local shows, that tell the station why you're supporting sponsors or why you're a sponsor.
[00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:10.558]  And it's those of you that spread the word about this radio show that make it possible.
[00:10:10.558 --> 00:10:17.919]  And we've had a lot of ups and downs in 20 years on air, but if you look at the graph, it just goes straight up to frightening levels.
[00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:24.341]  It's frightening to easily have 18 million viewers and listeners a week by every metric.
[00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:27.026]  In fact, that's a very low number.
[00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:29.768]  Sometimes we have 10 million YouTube views a week.
[00:10:29.768 --> 00:10:35.471]  But if you count AM and FM stations, 3 million listeners a day, most folks tune in once or twice a week.
[00:10:35.471 --> 00:10:40.274]  If you add it all together, it's about 10 million listened terrestrially every week, one way or another.
[00:10:40.274 --> 00:10:46.778]  If you add in YouTube and satellite and shortwave and other platforms, it's over 25 million.
[00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:53.602]  But we just say 18 million because through some of the ad agencies that are out there that have derivative breakdown aggregates, it's 18 million.
[00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:54.783]  That number's about two years old.
[00:10:55.603 --> 00:10:59.545]  This radio show reaches 18 million people a week.
[00:10:59.545 --> 00:11:02.906]  That is just a gargantuan responsibility.
[00:11:02.906 --> 00:11:06.147]  And that doesn't mean we're in listening areas that have 18 million people.
[00:11:06.147 --> 00:11:10.829]  A lot of talk show hosts will be in a city with a million listeners, potentially, and say, we have a million listeners.
[00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:11.850]  No, no, no.
[00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.191]  Rated, we have 18 million.
[00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:21.854]  18 million people tune into this radio show worldwide, about half of them in the United States.
[00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:27.285]  So we're talking nine million a week in the United States.
[00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:32.651]  Other places we're top, Canada, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland.
[00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:34.453]  You can go to Alexa.com.
[00:11:35.635 --> 00:11:39.878]  Alexa.com, and it's an Amazon company that does online ratings.
[00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:40.919]  It's pretty accurate overall.
[00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:47.443]  It matches our Google Analytics and other ad agency arbitra, wide-spectrum analysis we have.
[00:11:47.443 --> 00:11:58.370]  And you look at it, and it's scary how the numbers fit depending on the metric, whether it's Google Analytics or what Amazon uses, and you can see the countries where we're huge.
[00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.773]  We're bigger in places like Switzerland than we are in the U.S.
[00:12:02.776 --> 00:12:05.318]  You know, whereas we might be number 400 in the U.S.
[00:12:05.318 --> 00:12:12.283]  Last time I checked her websites, we might be number 5 in some African countries.
[00:12:12.283 --> 00:12:13.624]  Yeah.
[00:12:13.624 --> 00:12:16.366]  I mean, this broadcast is really special.
[00:12:16.366 --> 00:12:22.811]  And I'm not up here on some high horse, before I get into all this news, telling you, hey, we're big.
[00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:24.152]  We wear big breeches.
[00:12:24.152 --> 00:12:25.113]  Boy, we're really special.
[00:12:25.113 --> 00:12:26.053]  Give us a red carpet.
[00:12:26.053 --> 00:12:26.674]  It's the opposite.
[00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:47.670]  I'm telling you that we are having major effects worldwide and that if other people listening who are already talk show hosts or who are publishers or who are scientists or lawyers who are well-spoken, if you would engage in the fight for humanity, you would have a big success as well.
[00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:53.375]  And you spiritually and physically would gain great wealth for your family's future.
[00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:54.756]  This is where the real fight is.
[00:12:55.802 --> 00:13:00.643]  It's not in the fanciest jet, or sports car, or the biggest mansion.
[00:13:00.643 --> 00:13:05.324]  And believe me, I could have all of that, and I've had a taste of all of that, and it means nothing.
[00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:06.684]  My rank right now in the U.S.
[00:13:06.684 --> 00:13:06.824]  is 544.
[00:13:06.824 --> 00:13:09.825]  Oh, no, I'm sorry, MSNBC's 544.
[00:13:09.825 --> 00:13:12.445]  We're 356 in the U.S.
[00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:13.126]  I thought we'd gone down.
[00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:14.746]  I'm sorry, we've gone up about 100 points, sorry.
[00:13:14.746 --> 00:13:15.726]  MSNBC.com's 544.
[00:13:15.726 --> 00:13:16.866]  We're 350-something, sorry.
[00:13:20.006 --> 00:13:30.973]  So that's why they have George Soros' Media Matters doing investigations on us, sending private detectives, literally digging through our trash cans.
[00:13:30.973 --> 00:13:32.033]  They're scared.
[00:13:32.033 --> 00:13:33.274]  And they should be.
[00:13:33.274 --> 00:13:37.777]  Because if a bumbling, stuttering, hillbilly redneck
[00:13:39.608 --> 00:13:44.610]  With no college degree can be kicking your ass worldwide right now.
[00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.432]  Can you imagine when the other men, greater than I, stand up?
[00:13:48.432 --> 00:13:49.452]  It's game over.
[00:13:49.452 --> 00:13:55.075]  And let me give you a message that I've been given for 20 years, because in my heart I've always known this.
[00:13:55.075 --> 00:14:01.198]  I'm here to blow the alarm, to blow the trumpet, to get the real warriors up.
[00:14:02.165 --> 00:14:03.185]  That's all I'm doing.
[00:14:03.185 --> 00:14:04.706]  I got big lungs.
[00:14:04.706 --> 00:14:06.307]  I'm willing to scream out.
[00:14:06.307 --> 00:14:07.828]  I'm up there on the parapet.
[00:14:07.828 --> 00:14:09.949]  The enemy tells me there's no attack going on.
[00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:10.689]  Bull!
[00:14:10.689 --> 00:14:13.070]  We're losing our freedoms up one side and down the other.
[00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:13.870]  We're being enslaved.
[00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.472]  And I've been blowing that watchman horn.
[00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:17.692]  I've been blowing that trumpet.
[00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:20.574]  And let me tell you, the fires are being lit.
[00:14:20.574 --> 00:14:26.376]  I can see the watchtowers firing up all over the world as humanity and that great spirit fires up.
[00:14:26.376 --> 00:14:27.737]  And it's such an incredible honor
[00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:38.262]  For all of my foibles and all my warts and everything that I've done that's been bad, I did it from a position of trying to do the right thing and trying to warn people.
[00:14:38.262 --> 00:14:40.684]  And it's hit the zeitgeist.
[00:14:40.684 --> 00:14:44.507]  It's hit pay dirt, pay dirt over and over again.
[00:14:44.507 --> 00:14:55.856]  And I'm not looking for physical wealth, but I have raised, I did the math a few months ago with the accountants, $187 million in 20 years to finance this operation.
[00:14:55.856 --> 00:14:58.158]  That's an example of what one person can do
[00:14:59.795 --> 00:15:16.806]  Cost me tens of millions of dollars a year to run this operation, and you, the listeners, have come and supported us with the high-quality products at InfowarsStore.com, and we've put 95% of that money back into the operation after taxes, and it's had a huge effect, so I salute you all.
[00:15:16.806 --> 00:15:18.427]  You have helped forge this sword.
[00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:20.915]  It's already had such a great effect.
[00:15:20.915 --> 00:15:24.502]  It is Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:24.502 --> 00:15:30.133]  And you've helped forge this sword that I know that if we take the proper actions, it can be the weapon.
[00:15:31.258 --> 00:15:37.323]  That begins to open up the veins of the globalists of the information war and we will bring them down.
[00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:38.424]  We're here.
[00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:40.605]  We're real.
[00:15:40.605 --> 00:15:41.986]  110% on the battlefield.
[00:15:41.986 --> 00:15:43.668]  Committed to human liberty.
[00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:45.409]  Committed to fair play.
[00:15:45.409 --> 00:15:47.330]  Committed to a level playing field.
[00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.952]  Committed to empowering families.
[00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:51.974]  Committed to self-defense.
[00:15:51.974 --> 00:15:55.136]  Committed to space travel and victory and innovation.
[00:15:55.136 --> 00:15:57.258]  When we come back, we'll tell you what the enemy's into.
[00:15:59.767 --> 00:16:01.748]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:16:01.748 --> 00:16:05.550]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.492]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:16:08.492 --> 00:16:12.134]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:16:12.134 --> 00:16:21.159]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:32.592]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.

[00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:19.275]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:17:19.275 --> 00:17:19.976]  We're good to go.
[00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:39.441]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder.
[00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:50.250]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.

[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:08.542]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[00:18:08.542 --> 00:18:19.065]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[00:18:19.065 --> 00:18:25.147]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:18:25.487 --> 00:18:31.893]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:40.502]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[00:18:40.502 --> 00:18:43.585]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:44.726]  No needles, no injections.
[00:18:45.106 --> 00:18:46.488]  Don't take my word for it.
[00:18:46.488 --> 00:18:47.709]  Try it for yourself.
[00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:50.132]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.
[00:18:50.132 --> 00:18:52.455]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.042]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:19:33.042 --> 00:19:37.325]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:19:37.325 --> 00:19:39.106]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:19:39.106 --> 00:19:44.430]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.971]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:19:46.971 --> 00:19:48.112]  But for how long?
[00:19:48.112 --> 00:19:50.313]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[00:19:50.313 --> 00:19:54.736]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:57.558]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:20:02.364 --> 00:20:21.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.577 --> 00:20:29.302]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:42.398 --> 00:20:46.179]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're 20 minutes into the broadcast and I'm not even hit the news yet.
[00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:48.280]  I know that's why you tune in.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:58.565]  But the reason I spent a segment talking about this broadcast and the effect it's had was a testament to the power of human liberty and what individuals can do when they take action.
[00:21:00.239 --> 00:21:13.665]  And the major news organization with more than 50 crew members, with the nightly news, the documentary films, everything we do that reaches more than 20 million people a week, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:21:13.665 --> 00:21:18.587]  And the films that have been seen, it's ridiculous amounts.
[00:21:18.587 --> 00:21:23.549]  We have one YouTube channel with 500 million views total.
[00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:28.471]  It's like three times that.
[00:21:28.471 --> 00:21:29.211]  It's just amazing.
[00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:37.944]  And we can change the course of history if we just realize that we have power.
[00:21:37.944 --> 00:21:40.566]  That's what it takes.
[00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:43.267]  And we're not dead, that we're not in a coma.
[00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:47.249]  The whole social engineering program is about keeping us in a coma.
[00:21:47.249 --> 00:21:49.290]  Now just look at the stacks of news I have here.
[00:21:50.043 --> 00:21:54.325]  Because I didn't start pontificating about this radio show because I had lack of news.
[00:21:54.325 --> 00:22:06.070]  I mean, it just all ties together and it's all so epic, so incredible that I can't even give credence to breaking it down.
[00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.091]  Look at this story from Friday.
[00:22:08.091 --> 00:22:09.811]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:22:09.811 --> 00:22:12.893]  It's by Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars.com.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:32.570]  And you can go right to the Davos, Switzerland website and watch the video where they announce global government's here and that government mosquito drones will extract your DNA, forcibly inoculate you, and they said, quote, privacy is dead, they announced.
[00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.351]  Eric Schmidt announced the same thing from Google.
[00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:39.814]  This was from a professor, Seltzer, in computer science at Harvard University.
[00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:45.313]  That's one article out of 200 plus I've got here.
[00:22:45.313 --> 00:22:47.516]  They're all just as insane.
[00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:50.739]  It's not me saying all this.
[00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:54.824]  It's what they're building.
[00:22:54.824 --> 00:22:56.205]  And the paradigm shift is...
[00:22:57.418 --> 00:23:11.491]  For the first 10, 15 years or so, I was covering stuff that was in white papers, government documents, legislation, stuff listeners were mailing me that, you know, worked at universities, trade publications, and people hear this stuff and think, you're crazy.
[00:23:11.491 --> 00:23:21.279]  Now, it's just out in the open, so we've kind of crossed that event horizon Rubicon now, where some people go, okay, global government's being formed, what's the big deal?
[00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:22.320]  You know, on Star Trek,
[00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.381]  It's a global government.
[00:23:24.381 --> 00:23:32.924]  It's all going to be kumbaya, happy, lovey, and the planet's like some giant Whole Foods with trendies walking around.
[00:23:32.924 --> 00:23:37.986]  That's only the first level of the takeover to make you think it's going to bring you success.
[00:23:37.986 --> 00:23:39.947]  In the establishment's own words.
[00:23:39.947 --> 00:23:41.687]  In the endgame, it's hell on earth.
[00:23:41.687 --> 00:23:42.928]  And I want to break that down right now.
[00:23:45.336 --> 00:23:50.349]  But first off, Edward Snowden, Apple iPhone with secret eye feature allows government to spy on you.
[00:23:50.349 --> 00:23:53.316]  That's old news, but there he said it.
[00:23:53.316 --> 00:23:54.559]  Grease is anti-bailout.
[00:23:56.496 --> 00:24:03.122]  Party wins election, death of prosecutor shakes faith in president in Argentina, government institutions.
[00:24:03.122 --> 00:24:05.924]  I mean, he said they're going to kill me and they killed him.
[00:24:05.924 --> 00:24:08.967]  And now they're calling it a conspiracy theory if you question it.
[00:24:08.967 --> 00:24:11.789]  It just doesn't work anymore to say that.
[00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:14.171]  Major blizzard.
[00:24:14.171 --> 00:24:18.435]  De Blasio says it could be the biggest snowstorm ever to hit the city.
[00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:20.997]  Al Gore says, well, that the cold weather is caused by global warming.
[00:24:22.672 --> 00:24:26.753]  Iran lawmakers drafting law on nuclear enrichment hike.
[00:24:26.753 --> 00:24:34.155]  So the West is suddenly allied with Iran and they're suddenly saying they're going to blow up Israel and create nuclear weapons and all the rest of it.
[00:24:34.155 --> 00:24:36.396]  It's just crazy.
[00:24:36.396 --> 00:24:43.537]  And meanwhile our government's also backing Saudi Arabia and Al-Qaeda running around under the name ISIS.
[00:24:43.537 --> 00:24:45.638]  China admittedly is going into a depression.
[00:24:45.638 --> 00:24:46.578]  That's the one in Guardian.
[00:24:46.578 --> 00:24:48.939]  We predicted that years ago.
[00:24:48.939 --> 00:24:49.759]  Harry Dent and other
[00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:57.507]  Harvey Dent and others, not the comic book character, but Harry Dent, not Harvey Dent.
[00:24:57.507 --> 00:24:58.447]  We should get him back on.
[00:24:58.447 --> 00:25:00.207]  I tell you, that guy's amazing.
[00:25:00.207 --> 00:25:02.828]  We'll also get into hating whitey.
[00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:07.329]  Arizona State stirs pot, teaching the problem of whites class.
[00:25:07.329 --> 00:25:09.250]  See, the problem is white people.
[00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.930]  Yeah, that's 7% of the world population.
[00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.331]  Let's just get rid of them.
[00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:16.112]  We'll get rid of Beethoven and rocket ships as well.
[00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:20.530]  We're going to get to that.
[00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.430]  Hey, I'll say it.
[00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.031]  Palin's a lot better than Jeb Bush or Chris Christie.
[00:25:27.031 --> 00:25:28.892]  She's the real deal.
[00:25:28.892 --> 00:25:33.073]  And that's why the system attacks her and says she's dumb because she's a woman.
[00:25:33.073 --> 00:25:39.894]  With these fake feminist dirtbags that are really just social controllers that want to dominate women and lecture to them and not let them make their own decisions.
[00:25:39.894 --> 00:25:42.495]  Every fake leftist feminist doesn't want a woman to be armed.
[00:25:42.495 --> 00:25:44.995]  That right there shows you don't care about women.
[00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:47.516]  I mean, Sarah Palin is so much better.
[00:25:48.655 --> 00:25:52.036]  than the current so-called neocon leadership of the Republican Party.
[00:25:52.036 --> 00:25:55.496]  Now, is she as good as a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz?
[00:25:55.496 --> 00:25:55.756]  No.
[00:25:55.756 --> 00:25:58.217]  But she'd make a hell of a VP.
[00:25:58.217 --> 00:25:59.997]  That's a winning ticket right there.
[00:25:59.997 --> 00:26:00.877]  Let's cont- oh yeah.
[00:26:00.877 --> 00:26:04.758]  Can you imagine Cruz, Palin?
[00:26:04.758 --> 00:26:13.599]  Or... And I'm sorry, if she was as smart or as constitutional as a Ted Cruz, I'd say her.
[00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:17.100]  But I mean, I've just, I've listened to them both, read their writings, they're both really smart.
[00:26:18.456 --> 00:26:24.098]  I don't think in the law, and giving slick speeches, I'm as good as Ted Cruz.
[00:26:24.098 --> 00:26:25.878]  I'm sorry, he's just more presidential.
[00:26:25.878 --> 00:26:31.219]  The winning ticket is Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, or Rand Paul, Sarah Palin.
[00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:33.620]  It cannot be beaten!
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.240]  Look at every Democrat.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.741]  I'm sorry, I'm salivating.
[00:26:37.741 --> 00:26:40.422]  Oh, if we could just turn our power plants back on.
[00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:46.813]  Just not sell the country out to derivatives and repeal Obamacare.
[00:26:46.813 --> 00:26:48.534]  I'd save the country right there.
[00:26:48.534 --> 00:26:54.118]  I'm sorry, I'm having, well they call them precipitation dreams.
[00:26:54.118 --> 00:26:57.761]  I better stop right now.
[00:26:57.761 --> 00:26:59.542]  So we've got that in the stack.
[00:26:59.542 --> 00:27:08.289]  We've got this whole Seahawks, ballgate, inflatagate, deflatagate.
[00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:11.788]  And the Patriots have said they've done nothing wrong.
[00:27:11.788 --> 00:27:19.119]  The reason this story is important is that it shows how the public loves a conspiracy theory that doesn't affect anything real.
[00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:21.242]  Other than your fantasy football, I guess, and your gambling.
[00:27:22.403 --> 00:27:24.785]  Who cares if the New England Patriots cheated?
[00:27:24.785 --> 00:27:25.626]  It's a game.
[00:27:25.626 --> 00:27:26.867]  It's entertainment.
[00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:27.968]  All these teams are cheating.
[00:27:27.968 --> 00:27:28.989]  They're all on ROIDS.
[00:27:28.989 --> 00:27:30.510]  They're all on growth hormone.
[00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.451]  I mean, most of them are.
[00:27:31.451 --> 00:27:33.552]  It's a constant corruption.
[00:27:33.552 --> 00:27:34.393]  They're on drugs.
[00:27:34.393 --> 00:27:36.695]  They're injecting them with painkillers on their knees.
[00:27:36.695 --> 00:27:37.736]  Everyone knows this.
[00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:39.978]  Of course they're being brain damaged.
[00:27:39.978 --> 00:27:42.240]  Of course it's a scam.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:48.665]  But they're not taxing us, other than their fake football stadiums that we have to pay for.
[00:27:48.665 --> 00:27:49.205]  They're not.
[00:27:50.256 --> 00:27:51.396]  Taking my guns.
[00:27:51.396 --> 00:27:53.937]  They're not putting fluoride in my water.
[00:27:53.937 --> 00:27:56.938]  But people love... Oh yeah!
[00:27:56.938 --> 00:28:08.441]  The Patriots, they're involved in a conspiracy and everybody wants to email me and talk about it and go over every level of it and why the teams bring their own balls and everything else.
[00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:10.622]  There's all the ball jokes that go along with it.
[00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:20.199]  How is there a conspiracy here, but there's not with LIBOR and World Interest Rates, or the Private Federal Reserve, or derivatives?
[00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:21.999]  I mean, that's what really affects you.
[00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:23.800]  That's where you're really being screwed over.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.500]  But it's boring suits and ties.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.121]  I mean, who cares?
[00:28:27.121 --> 00:28:28.341]  So let's cover this right now.
[00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:34.162]  Patriots say they followed the rules and accept no blame.
[00:28:34.162 --> 00:28:38.383]  Belichick says 100% Patriots did nothing wrong.
[00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:40.644]  Well, there's referees that you see handling those balls.
[00:28:42.358 --> 00:28:45.580]  I mean, they love to squeeze on them and see if they're inflated or not.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:55.165]  And, you know, by the end of the game, I guess they... Do they drain them before they pass them on to, like, sell them on the eBay or whatever?
[00:28:55.165 --> 00:28:57.066]  Or is that Obama?
[00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:04.548]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super male.
[00:29:04.548 --> 00:29:06.529]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:09.491]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again.

[00:31:59.241 --> 00:32:00.242]  Alex Jones here.
[00:32:00.242 --> 00:32:09.393]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:32:09.393 --> 00:32:14.579]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[00:32:14.959 --> 00:32:18.680]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:28.242]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:32:28.242 --> 00:32:39.644]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:32:39.644 --> 00:32:44.405]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts
[00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:46.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:16.095 --> 00:33:18.436]  Listen to this baloney.
[00:33:18.436 --> 00:33:24.117]  It's always a tough vote because the average person thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt.
[00:33:24.117 --> 00:33:30.379]  Raising the debt ceiling, which has been done over a hundred times, does not increase our debt.
[00:33:30.379 --> 00:33:33.720]  It does not somehow promote profitability.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.121]  All it does is it says, you gotta pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress.
[00:33:39.838 --> 00:33:48.403]  So, uh, the national debt's doubled under Obama from... You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:48.403 --> 00:33:52.906]  From what?
[00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:56.488]  9 trillion to 18 trillion.
[00:33:56.488 --> 00:33:58.029]  And it hadn't gone up.
[00:33:58.029 --> 00:34:01.071]  Because he said so.
[00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:03.272]  And if you disagree with that, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:07.623]  Well, then brand me a conspiracy theorist.
[00:34:07.623 --> 00:34:11.106]  That means someone that questions known liars.
[00:34:11.106 --> 00:34:17.891]  The media can point at a bunch of schizophrenics online, you know, that think all sorts of crazy stuff and say, oh, that's a conspiracy terrorist.
[00:34:17.891 --> 00:34:27.419]  No, a conspiracy terrorist is someone demonized by the known lying mainstream media who doesn't buy into lies anymore.
[00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:30.141]  Now, I mentioned a lot of this news, but let me drill into it right now.
[00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:35.187]  Why are we in so much trouble?
[00:34:35.187 --> 00:34:48.486]  A. B. Why do we need to wake up now to avert this large global corporate plan that is being carried out?
[00:34:50.765 --> 00:35:00.028]  I don't have to sit up here and convince you global government's being formed, that large corporate industries are running it, that large mega banks created thousands of trillions in fake derivatives they used to buy out the world.
[00:35:00.028 --> 00:35:01.628]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:35:01.628 --> 00:35:06.229]  I don't have to convince you that international bankers rule the world and call the shots.
[00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:07.169]  That's on CNBC.
[00:35:07.169 --> 00:35:10.930]  In fact, when we come back in the next intro, let's play that intro that has that.
[00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.411]  Just for new listeners that haven't heard it over and over again.
[00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:16.192]  All the newscasts announcing we're slaves to private bankers.
[00:35:16.192 --> 00:35:18.533]  Aren't we all just slaves, international bankers?
[00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:19.753]  Don't they control the governments?
[00:35:20.353 --> 00:35:23.554]  Every guest, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:30.638]  So, Ron Paul, 30 years ago, myself 20 years ago, we don't have to now convince people this is going on.
[00:35:30.638 --> 00:35:33.119]  It's admitted, because they're in the endgame.
[00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:35.720]  The question is, where do they take us in the endgame?
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.942]  And so you might want to listen to us now, because we were right before.
[00:35:39.942 --> 00:35:45.304]  Just kind of a rule that you like to go to people for financial advice that have been right over and over again.
[00:35:45.304 --> 00:35:46.285]  You like to go to folks that
[00:35:47.285 --> 00:35:54.912]  That are guides that know how to take you to the best fishing holes, who are right over and over again have the highest ratings, or restaurants that have the highest ratings.
[00:35:54.912 --> 00:35:57.915]  You know, you go to who tends to deliver.
[00:35:57.915 --> 00:36:03.441]  Now, does mainstream media deliver?
[00:36:03.441 --> 00:36:05.743]  Well, for the last 30, 40 years, they've denied all this.
[00:36:05.743 --> 00:36:08.525]  Now that it's coming out, they just throw it in your face.
[00:36:08.525 --> 00:36:12.109]  So more and more, we can use mainstream media because they're just reporting on what's already happened.
[00:36:13.547 --> 00:36:22.595]  There is a collection of private families and mega central banks that control government's issuance of currency and credit who have taken much of the world over.
[00:36:22.595 --> 00:36:28.020]  They're mopping up a few sectors, Russia, China, the Middle East, and parts of Africa right now.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:35.347]  They're taking those over by the sword and by economic conquest and economic depression, economic warfare.
[00:36:35.347 --> 00:36:36.548]  And their stated plan
[00:36:37.535 --> 00:36:45.499]  is to end the renaissance that started roughly 500 years ago with the Gutenberg Press.
[00:36:45.499 --> 00:36:51.541]  That's the printing press, ladies and gentlemen, that first printed the Gutenberg Bible.
[00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:52.962]  This is their own stated goal.
[00:36:52.962 --> 00:36:55.283]  I'm going to get into Davos openly announcing this in a moment.
[00:36:55.283 --> 00:36:56.484]  You understand?
[00:36:56.484 --> 00:36:58.044]  They're announcing this.
[00:36:58.044 --> 00:37:00.125]  So, you're not allowed to say it's not happening, okay?
[00:37:02.259 --> 00:37:03.800]  They don't like the Renaissance.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:10.182]  Now, why did the oligarchs of 500 years ago, the royal families and the church, not like it then?
[00:37:10.182 --> 00:37:14.563]  Because there were scientists that said the Earth wasn't the center of the universe, and they didn't like that.
[00:37:14.563 --> 00:37:19.965]  Nowadays, we like to think America's the center of the universe or something, you know, but the point is, it's not.
[00:37:19.965 --> 00:37:30.548]  So you had a bunch of oligarchs and special interests that wanted to be in total control, like North Korea, where people think that Kim Jong-un makes the sun come up in the morning, while he's hanging out with Dennis Rodman and other bizarre behaviors.
[00:37:32.242 --> 00:37:37.768]  It doesn't matter though, because there was a free market of ideas that began to develop.
[00:37:37.768 --> 00:37:46.639]  In Europe, the Dark Age from Japan to Germany began to end, 500 years ago roughly.
[00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:49.021]  Can you guys give me the date of the Gutenberg?
[00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:49.362]  I think it's...
[00:37:51.937 --> 00:37:55.179]  14, late 14's if I'm right, maybe 15 early's, I forget.
[00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:56.680]  Let's just see.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.581]  I wouldn't win Jeopardy!
[00:37:57.581 --> 00:37:59.482]  is the point, but let's just pull it up.
[00:37:59.482 --> 00:38:07.967]  But that's established by most historians that the Gutenberg Press, the printing press, is the mark of the beginning of the Renaissance.
[00:38:07.967 --> 00:38:11.369]  So the elites, the royalty, the church, they're all worried about it.
[00:38:11.369 --> 00:38:11.850]  What do they do?
[00:38:12.847 --> 00:38:17.009]  They begin to try to use licenses and other things to control the new renaissance.
[00:38:17.009 --> 00:38:18.710]  They try to take control of society.
[00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:25.473]  They fund Malthus and they fund Galton and they fund eugenics the last two hundred years.
[00:38:25.473 --> 00:38:34.657]  So there's competing oligarch systems and oligarch formulas of control and monopolies versus free market open systems.
[00:38:34.657 --> 00:38:39.759]  Now they've just used the last hundred years, the incredible largesse, the glut of goods and services
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.162]  and media to create a decadent slob class.
[00:38:43.162 --> 00:38:44.342]  I'm part of it.
[00:38:44.342 --> 00:38:54.089]  Though I'm on the upper end of being awake and involved and caring and dynamic, I'm still a giant walrus-like slob compared to my forebears.
[00:38:54.089 --> 00:39:05.637]  So you've got a world of walrus-like slobs in the West, too lazy to have children, too lazy to have a destiny, too lazy to even want anything in the future, versus the starving, murdered third-world population.
[00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:08.459]  And you've got the tiny technocrats above that in their own words,
[00:39:10.006 --> 00:39:21.995]  Who decided that when they go to Whole Foods, or they go to the shopping mall, or they go to the airport, they don't like crowds of people, and they don't like how stupid and ignorant and self-centered you are.
[00:39:21.995 --> 00:39:23.816]  They're self-centered, but they know the game plan.
[00:39:23.816 --> 00:39:25.978]  They were smart enough to run, you know,
[00:39:27.423 --> 00:39:35.167]  Credit default swap scams and other derivatives frauds, and they were happy to have subprime bubble scams.
[00:39:35.167 --> 00:39:36.808]  I've got some of their quotes here today.
[00:39:36.808 --> 00:39:48.494]  Those very billionaires are in the news at Davos saying you don't need air conditioning or a car, not in Africa like Obama said last year, but in America.
[00:39:48.494 --> 00:39:55.618]  And they're going to take everything you've got and transfer that money to themselves to live
[00:39:57.054 --> 00:40:01.177]  Like no kings ever lived before on steroids.
[00:40:01.177 --> 00:40:01.898]  And you know what?
[00:40:01.898 --> 00:40:04.460]  They've learned through social engineering, you're going to enjoy it.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.941]  And it has nothing to do with saving the earth.
[00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:12.646]  But they do look at seven and a half billion people and all the resources that are being used, and they see those as their resources.
[00:40:13.573 --> 00:40:16.436]  And so, billionaire lectures surfs in Davos.
[00:40:16.436 --> 00:40:20.881]  America's lifestyle expectations are far too high, close quote.
[00:40:20.881 --> 00:40:35.996]  If you listen closely this morning, you could hear humanity vomit as JP Morgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, began to speak at Davos, who flew there in a $100 million jet with a huge entourage of four other aircraft.
[00:40:35.996 --> 00:40:36.757]  Which, hey, great!
[00:40:38.168 --> 00:40:43.831]  You know, and he gets chumps to go out and get balloon mortgages, and then he goes out and gets the government to bail it out.
[00:40:43.831 --> 00:40:46.932]  And then he sits there, when the government bails out J.P.
[00:40:46.932 --> 00:40:50.954]  Morgan, he then lectures the government, who's now a debtor to J.P.
[00:40:50.954 --> 00:40:53.695]  Morgan for bailing them out.
[00:40:53.695 --> 00:40:58.017]  See how that works?
[00:40:58.017 --> 00:40:58.978]  Here's another one.
[00:40:58.978 --> 00:41:06.241]  Al Gore spends $90 trillion to ban cars from every major city in the world, Daily Caller, and it's got his quotes.
[00:41:08.206 --> 00:41:21.804]  And the GCEC study that says just ban cars entirely, because the elite fly helicopters anyways, and then just charge you so much for a 200 square foot apartment that it's the equivalent of a 10,000 square foot house.
[00:41:21.804 --> 00:41:22.364]  I'm not joking.
[00:41:22.364 --> 00:41:24.066]  These are real actuaries.
[00:41:24.066 --> 00:41:24.627]  Why not?
[00:41:24.627 --> 00:41:25.749]  The public will put up with it.
[00:41:27.031 --> 00:41:42.222]  If you have some simpering person with an NPR voice, you know, with cornrows or, you know, with their pants hanging down over their butt or some kind of trendy outfit, you know, with a John Lennon shirt on, people do whatever they're told.
[00:41:43.063 --> 00:41:44.064]  They're told it's trendy.
[00:41:44.064 --> 00:41:46.446]  It's not a fascist world government takeover.
[00:41:46.446 --> 00:41:52.412]  It's not a plan to cut off resources to the third world that'll kill a billion people conservatively in the next ten years, according to many metrics.
[00:41:52.412 --> 00:41:58.077]  It is the most trendy, cool thing ever heard of in the world to be poor.
[00:41:58.077 --> 00:42:03.342]  And to pay for a tiny car which you would previously pay, you know, for the finest Mercedes.
[00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:08.955]  You want a motorcycle on four wheels and a tin can that's incredibly dangerous and everything else?
[00:42:08.955 --> 00:42:10.296]  Oh, it's for the earth, blah, blah, blah.
[00:42:10.296 --> 00:42:15.598]  While they block real innovation and all the other clean technologies that are out there.
[00:42:15.598 --> 00:42:26.981]  Here it is, Obama seeks to put Alaska Refuge, that's 90% of the state, off limits to drilling, while he gives a State of the Union speech last week claiming that he wants us to be energy independent.
[00:42:26.981 --> 00:42:32.103]  So there you go, Al Gore's got something like 10 houses, one of them's 40,000 square feet or something.
[00:42:33.726 --> 00:42:35.808]  But you shouldn't be able to have a house.
[00:42:35.808 --> 00:42:38.510]  Just remember that.
[00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:53.761]  So this is the plan, and when we come back, before I get to other news and open the phones up to your calls, I want to talk about the difference between a free market system, a renaissance system, and a crony-capitalist-collectivist system on the other side.
[00:42:53.761 --> 00:42:55.362]  Because this is the whole ballgame.
[00:42:55.362 --> 00:42:57.283]  This is how the world really works, folks.
[00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:57.964]  Don't you want to know?
[00:43:00.117 --> 00:43:03.778]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:43:03.778 --> 00:43:08.059]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:43:08.059 --> 00:43:09.839]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:43:09.839 --> 00:43:17.681]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:43:17.681 --> 00:43:18.821]  But for how long?
[00:43:18.821 --> 00:43:25.462]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:43:25.462 --> 00:43:28.283]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:43:29.656 --> 00:43:33.159]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:43:33.159 --> 00:43:41.425]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:43:41.425 --> 00:43:46.829]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:49.371]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:43:49.371 --> 00:43:51.472]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:44:02.035 --> 00:44:05.696]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[00:44:05.696 --> 00:44:06.536]  Security alert.
[00:44:06.536 --> 00:44:07.756]  Security alert.
[00:44:07.756 --> 00:44:09.777]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:44:09.777 --> 00:44:10.657]  Analysis.
[00:44:10.657 --> 00:44:13.337]  InfoWars building independent media operations.
[00:44:13.337 --> 00:44:18.358]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[00:44:18.358 --> 00:44:19.378]  Prime Directive.
[00:44:19.378 --> 00:44:20.939]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[00:44:20.939 --> 00:44:23.699]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:27.020]  It's a popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.200]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.840]  People are assaulting us.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.701]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:44:33.701 --> 00:44:35.641]  They're never going to stop.
[00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:39.662]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[00:44:39.662 --> 00:44:43.262]  Block free iPhone ads at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:43.262 --> 00:44:46.623]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[00:44:46.623 --> 00:44:47.603]  Imperative.
[00:44:47.603 --> 00:44:49.544]  Destroy criminalized TV.
[00:44:49.544 --> 00:44:54.324]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:55.705]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:44:55.705 --> 00:44:56.465]  You can feel it.
[00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:01.101]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:45:01.101 --> 00:45:04.904]  Tried and true, trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:45:04.904 --> 00:45:07.846]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:45:07.846 --> 00:45:11.489]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:45:11.489 --> 00:45:20.516]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge and prepare your body for what experts admit is the most dangerous season of the year.
[00:45:20.916 --> 00:45:31.942]  We have rejected hundreds of other formulations in our quest to bring you what is simply the most powerful and comprehensive proprietary formula that we have ever created in the realm of herbal immunity.
[00:45:31.942 --> 00:45:39.686]  For the last two years, our team has been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to develop the ultimate nutraceutical formulation.
[00:45:39.686 --> 00:45:47.770]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.010]  For a limited time, get 25% off
[00:45:50.231 --> 00:45:50.952]  We're good to go.
[00:46:18.454 --> 00:46:24.897]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed by the body.
[00:46:24.897 --> 00:46:31.279]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:46:31.279 --> 00:46:36.561]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin, the most bioavailable
[00:46:36.561 --> 00:46:37.641]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:15.794 --> 00:47:26.657]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[00:47:26.657 --> 00:47:32.578]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:47:32.578 --> 00:47:38.640]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.080]  It is a big idea.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.441]  A new world order.
[00:47:45.754 --> 00:47:48.395]  It was almost as if it were planned in post.
[00:47:48.395 --> 00:47:52.757]  It's just pancakes.
[00:47:52.757 --> 00:47:56.559]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:48:10.146 --> 00:48:15.128]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:48:15.128 --> 00:48:19.210]  Criminals like you?
[00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.211]  Guns will be taken.
[00:48:20.211 --> 00:48:21.411]  No one will be able to be honest.
[00:48:21.411 --> 00:48:23.553]  We're gonna take all of them.
[00:48:23.553 --> 00:48:28.395]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:48:28.395 --> 00:48:29.956]  Global governance at last.
[00:48:29.956 --> 00:48:30.936]  Is it one world?
[00:48:30.936 --> 00:48:32.397]  The central bankers in charge.
[00:48:32.397 --> 00:48:36.279]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:48:36.279 --> 00:48:36.579]  As for me!
[00:48:38.863 --> 00:48:55.939]  Yeah, there was that short clip of CNBC, the central bankers are in charge, we're all just their slaves.
[00:48:55.939 --> 00:48:59.362]  And again, people have been taught you're either a communist or you're a right-winger.
[00:49:01.032 --> 00:49:12.535]  Because that's what the left says, oh, we're socialists, but you study what they do, lean forward, and all those MSNBC slogans are like Marxist-Leninist famous slogans.
[00:49:12.535 --> 00:49:20.878]  If you're informed, you look at it, you go, oh my God, it's Engels, it's Marx, it's Lenin.
[00:49:20.878 --> 00:49:23.198]  But it's not.
[00:49:23.198 --> 00:49:27.400]  It's just big megabanks that control governments and issue the money.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.500]  They can buy everything up.
[00:49:29.699 --> 00:49:34.961]  So they don't like free market because you end up owning your own property, you end up owning your own factory.
[00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:38.542]  They want you on government welfare or they want you with a government loan.
[00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.723]  They want to run your life.
[00:49:39.723 --> 00:49:44.145]  They're the opposite of a renaissance economy 500 years old.
[00:49:44.145 --> 00:49:47.766]  They're the old system of serfdom, of feudalism, of control.
[00:49:49.008 --> 00:50:08.114]  And they dress it up in nice little black ladies, like MSNBC, in little pink dresses going, oh, communism's good, oh, we love the children, or nice little white guys in little suits to appeal to everybody.
[00:50:08.114 --> 00:50:15.116]  And they come on there and say, your kids belong to the state, and other just over-the-top statements to get us all fighting with each other.
[00:50:18.596 --> 00:50:25.702]  While the decision has been made, and I just read a couple mainstream headlines, that you can't have anything.
[00:50:25.702 --> 00:50:27.643]  You've got to be totally poor.
[00:50:27.643 --> 00:50:29.064]  Humans are bad.
[00:50:29.064 --> 00:50:32.127]  And they're not even saying that because humans might be hurting the earth.
[00:50:32.127 --> 00:50:39.773]  They're just saying it so they can swindle more of your money and jack up your taxes and exempt themselves.
[00:50:39.773 --> 00:50:43.356]  You see, they've set up a global government where they leave the nation states.
[00:50:43.356 --> 00:50:47.219]  There's a global corporate government with all these secret treaties on record.
[00:50:48.052 --> 00:50:52.298]  And then you get the treaties decades later, they're all exempt from taxes.
[00:50:52.298 --> 00:51:00.549]  See, if they weren't exempt from the taxes being this high, you would have lower taxes because they'd be under the same ones.
[00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:02.491]  It's the ultimate form of discrimination.
[00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:22.591]  That's why they scream racism, racism, sexism, sexism all day, and so we're all looking for signs of a black person being racist, or a white person being racist, or a Hispanic being racist, or a man not treating a woman right, or vice versa, or, oh my gosh, men are urinating standing up, let's arrest them in Germany.
[00:51:22.591 --> 00:51:24.051]  I'm not joking, I've got that in the stack.
[00:51:29.878 --> 00:51:31.202]  We're being engineered.
[00:51:31.202 --> 00:51:32.385]  We're being enslaved.
[00:51:32.385 --> 00:51:34.531]  We're having our basic freedoms annihilated.
[00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:43.075]  In every club of Rome, Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Davos Switzerland speech.
[00:51:43.075 --> 00:51:46.478]  I was watching Davos on C-SPAN yesterday and I just randomly turned it on.
[00:51:46.478 --> 00:51:53.743]  They had some global EU banker saying we've got to lower standards of living and we've got to get rid of families.
[00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:55.184]  Oh yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:51:55.184 --> 00:51:57.526]  To fund government you need families.
[00:51:57.526 --> 00:51:59.608]  You need 2.1 children being born.
[00:51:59.608 --> 00:51:59.768]  We're 1.5.
[00:52:01.994 --> 00:52:05.316]  And is all this Greek or Martian to people?
[00:52:05.316 --> 00:52:07.056]  The West is already gone.
[00:52:07.056 --> 00:52:13.159]  Japan has 1.2 kids for every two adults.
[00:52:13.159 --> 00:52:17.742]  And idiots always send me emails and say, I can't believe you can even send emails.
[00:52:17.742 --> 00:52:19.943]  What do you mean 1.3 kids?
[00:52:19.943 --> 00:52:21.223]  You don't have 1.3.
[00:52:21.223 --> 00:52:23.844]  You either have one kid or you don't.
[00:52:23.844 --> 00:52:25.885]  We're talking about aggregate millions here.
[00:52:25.885 --> 00:52:30.668]  I mean, is the public so far gone it's just all over?
[00:52:31.588 --> 00:52:33.710]  I mean, is that what it's come down to?
[00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:40.518]  That you really want to just be engineered and learn how football works, or how to act cool, but not how the world works?
[00:52:40.518 --> 00:52:48.486]  You know, all the sports scores going back 50 years, and the baseball scores, and what type of underwear, Mickey Mantle wore, or Babe Ruth.
[00:52:48.486 --> 00:52:51.850]  Who cares whether the footballs were inflated or not?
[00:52:56.246 --> 00:52:58.269]  Does Obamacare increase your prices?
[00:52:58.269 --> 00:52:59.790]  Does it create death panels?
[00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:07.560]  You should take that personal because it does and now you're experiencing it.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:14.629]  So they want a world government not based on free market but by government regulations that are selectively enforced to shut down all the competition.
[00:53:16.912 --> 00:53:25.640]  And to put in tax incentives where Germany last year outlawed single parent, single, excuse me, single families, the word, homes.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:32.166]  You must live in big dormitories with a watchman that controls your life and social workers on every floor.
[00:53:32.166 --> 00:53:39.632]  I mean, this is hell that's being created.
[00:53:39.632 --> 00:53:41.014]  This is totalitarianism.
[00:53:42.295 --> 00:53:50.562]  But it's only allowed because there is a one-tenth of 1% that wants people to attack the 1%.
[00:53:50.562 --> 00:53:55.886]  No, if you look at it, about half the wealth's owned by a tiny fraction of the 1%.
[00:53:55.886 --> 00:54:03.853]  And they're waging war against the 20% that's the middle class that 30 years ago in the US, the numbers came out last week, was about 35-40%.
[00:54:03.853 --> 00:54:06.415]  The middle class is gone.
[00:54:06.415 --> 00:54:09.077]  And Obama gives all these speeches about middle class all day.
[00:54:10.774 --> 00:54:15.698]  Oh, KUT in Austin, look, tiny apartments could be answer to Austin's housing crunch.
[00:54:15.698 --> 00:54:18.720]  Oh, but they charge you more per square foot for them.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.841]  See, it's artificial scarcity.
[00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:23.223]  You don't get a little apartment and get it cheap.
[00:54:23.223 --> 00:54:30.208]  No, they just teach you to have less so the governing class can have a bigger piece of tax pie.
[00:54:30.208 --> 00:54:38.534]  And so more people can work for government or corporations that have government contracts so that the globalists can socially control you through that paycheck.
[00:54:40.376 --> 00:54:53.459]  The end of the Renaissance, the return of the Dark Age with a high-tech surveillance grid overlay that is a technotronic Armageddon.
[00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:56.020]  Look at these headlines.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.501]  Harvard professor, government mosquito drone will extract your DNA.
[00:55:01.547 --> 00:55:05.631]  You know, I see all these wild things on air that I've read from Davos over the last decade.
[00:55:05.631 --> 00:55:06.712]  It's just all from them.
[00:55:06.712 --> 00:55:15.100]  Harvard professor Margo Seltzer warned that miniature mosquito drones will one day forcibly extract your DNA on behalf of government insurance companies.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.784]  As she told scientists at the World Economic Forum in Davos that privacy was dead.
[00:55:20.094 --> 00:55:27.578]  Well, yeah, they're already putting in all the cars, tracker boxes that tax you by the mile in the last 15 years, and now they announced this year they're going to go live with them and start taxing.
[00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:30.239]  It's already begun in like eight cities.
[00:55:30.239 --> 00:55:38.063]  Seltzer, professor in computer science at Harvard University, told attendees, privacy as we knew it, in part, is no longer feasible.
[00:55:38.063 --> 00:55:40.424]  How we continually think of privacy is dead.
[00:55:40.424 --> 00:55:41.665]  See, oh, it's like a warning?
[00:55:41.665 --> 00:55:42.165]  No, it's not.
[00:55:42.165 --> 00:55:45.126]  It's, we will assimilate you, resistance is futile.
[00:55:45.126 --> 00:55:46.207]  That's what this announcement is.
[00:55:49.588 --> 00:55:55.871]  I remember like 12 years ago, Bill Gates came out and was already creating mosquitoes that have vaccines in them that are biological mosquitoes.
[00:55:55.871 --> 00:55:58.832]  And people didn't believe me when I was reading from his own Think Tank's website.
[00:55:58.832 --> 00:56:01.954]  Now let's continue down this line.
[00:56:01.954 --> 00:56:04.315]  This is a BizPac Review article.
[00:56:04.315 --> 00:56:11.178]  It links through the Arizona State University and local TV.
[00:56:12.622 --> 00:56:13.602]  This is a real headline.
[00:56:13.602 --> 00:56:15.623]  I didn't make this up.
[00:56:15.623 --> 00:56:21.945]  Well, don't worry.
[00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:27.347]  Just the last two weeks, over 100 white people were killed, confirmed, because they were white in the U.S.
[00:56:27.347 --> 00:56:28.967]  But it's only in local news, though.
[00:56:28.967 --> 00:56:29.367]  Who cares?
[00:56:29.367 --> 00:56:30.087]  They deserve to die.
[00:56:30.087 --> 00:56:30.488]  They're white.
[00:56:36.331 --> 00:56:39.213]  And to learn the, quote, problem of whiteness.
[00:56:39.213 --> 00:56:42.754]  And it goes through that whites are inherently an evil on the earth.
[00:56:42.754 --> 00:56:45.656]  This funded by the mega elite that control everything.
[00:56:45.656 --> 00:56:47.677]  Just to get us all fighting with each other.
[00:56:47.677 --> 00:56:50.959]  Here's another one from Infowars.com, Kurt Nimmo.
[00:56:50.959 --> 00:56:53.160]  He links through to the German newspapers.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.940]  You can't make this up.
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.581]  I remember covering this last year.
[00:56:55.581 --> 00:56:59.143]  German court rules man can urinate while standing up.
[00:56:59.143 --> 00:57:05.246]  Feminist groups had claimed that men urinating standing up was a privilege over women and was an act of male dominance.
[00:57:05.686 --> 00:57:19.940]  But a court has ruled that they will not pay a 2,855 pound damage for a feminist landowner, apartment owner that said that her male renters might splatter on the seat.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:21.601]  But remember last year Michelle Obama said,
[00:57:22.222 --> 00:57:25.545]  Don't say the word bossy because we're feminists aren't bossy.
[00:57:25.545 --> 00:57:38.776]  No, what you are is a bunch of hardcore totalitarian scumbags that want to control reality and lecture us how to live and operate while telling women that they shouldn't have a man in the house so they're alone and the state's their husband and a woman shouldn't have a gun.
[00:57:38.776 --> 00:57:39.477]  Well, you know what?
[00:57:39.477 --> 00:57:43.300]  Everybody's done with you and we know who you are, filth, and it's declassified.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.641]  You're CIA-funded.
[00:57:44.641 --> 00:57:46.102]  Second hour coming up.
[00:57:46.102 --> 00:57:47.303]  Will P. standing up.
[00:57:47.303 --> 00:57:47.964]  You can go to hell.
[00:57:49.929 --> 00:57:54.531]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges.
[00:57:54.531 --> 00:58:00.895]  Unlock the energy it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality.
[00:58:00.895 --> 00:58:10.320]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males and females.

[00:58:19.824 --> 00:58:23.486]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:58:23.486 --> 00:58:27.767]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:58:27.767 --> 00:58:29.548]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:58:29.548 --> 00:58:37.411]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:58:37.411 --> 00:58:38.552]  But for how long?

[00:58:45.175 --> 00:58:47.996]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:58:49.386 --> 00:58:56.590]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:44.380]  Silver Bullet.
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.421]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.457 --> 01:00:08.078]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.078 --> 01:00:12.759]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:12.759 --> 01:00:18.881]  I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 stacks I've gotten to on Sunday.
[01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:21.021]  It's usually about half the stacks.
[01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:28.342]  So, I didn't spend an hour on the global mindset and the technocracy and the plan to rob everybody's rights because I didn't have news to cover.
[01:00:28.342 --> 01:00:30.843]  We will intersperse the news, but I want to take your phone calls.
[01:00:32.213 --> 01:00:37.717]  But if you don't understand the globalist mindset, you have no hope.
[01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.798]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[01:00:39.798 --> 01:00:50.065]  And I sit here, living in this live science fiction dystopia movie, being a successful member of society,
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:01:07.144]  And I realize how they actuary the tyranny on the poor people first, but I see the water rising on the island I'm living on, and I have empathy for those being enslaved by this, and I realize this is a planned program.
[01:01:07.144 --> 01:01:11.725]  In their own words!
[01:01:11.725 --> 01:01:18.086]  And are we just gonna roll over to a bunch of scum like Al Gore?
[01:01:18.086 --> 01:01:20.067]  Are we really gonna play ball with these people?
[01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:27.254]  I've heard about feminists in public schools years ago and I didn't believe this when I first heard about it like 20 years ago.
[01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:42.104]  I would hear about it on conservative talk radio because they cover this and I think the feminists aren't trying to make boys in elementary school and then in high school pee sitting because it makes girls feel bad.
[01:01:42.104 --> 01:01:44.006]  I went and looked it up and they actually do that.
[01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:50.110]  I mean, these people want to tell you how to urinate.
[01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:52.072]  That is the definition of a control freak.
[01:01:52.072 --> 01:01:54.654]  I mean, I can't make this up.
[01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:59.399]  And these people are in control and relish telling us what to do?
[01:01:59.399 --> 01:01:59.919]  No!
[01:01:59.919 --> 01:02:00.300]  No!
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:00.360]  No!
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:00.840]  No!
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.280]  No!
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:01.320]  No!
[01:02:09.022 --> 01:02:18.984]  And you're gonna give us Prozac, you're gonna put Flora in the water, you're gonna shoot the babies up with all the vaccines, and watch them have a convulsion and never talk again, and be in diapers for the rest of their life?
[01:02:18.984 --> 01:02:22.845]  Because you're a bunch of murdering, sick control freaks.
[01:02:22.845 --> 01:02:25.046]  God, you people are trash.
[01:02:25.046 --> 01:02:33.908]  And you've got all these blind sheeple that are better people than you, they're just naive about who you are, because they think the rest of the world is like them, who are like lambs of the slaughter.
[01:02:33.908 --> 01:02:35.288]  Well, let me give you a little newsflash.
[01:02:36.246 --> 01:02:40.688]  And I've given this analogy hundreds of times before it was in the movie American Sniper.
[01:02:40.688 --> 01:02:42.849]  I am not a wolf, and I'm not a sheep.
[01:02:42.849 --> 01:02:47.050]  I am a vicious, giant, mean sheepdog.
[01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:55.533]  And I hate you, and I politically am gonna get my jaws around your neck, and I don't care what the other wolves with you do.
[01:02:55.533 --> 01:02:59.315]  I'm gonna crunch down with a look of extreme pleasure in my eyeballs.
[01:02:59.315 --> 01:03:01.716]  In fact, I've already done that.
[01:03:02.827 --> 01:03:04.829]  And I look to chomp down even harder.
[01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:06.750]  I don't care how you attack me.
[01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.972]  I don't care what you do.
[01:03:08.972 --> 01:03:15.578]  The feeling of freedom committing against you is, my soul lines up with it and just says, bingo.
[01:03:15.578 --> 01:03:16.099]  Bingo.
[01:03:16.099 --> 01:03:17.880]  This is what you're supposed to be doing.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:21.183]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away from this fight.
[01:03:21.183 --> 01:03:27.569]  And that's why I want to encourage everybody out there that's so afraid of tyranny, so afraid of getting on a list, so afraid of being demonized.
[01:03:28.632 --> 01:03:40.875]  To get attacked on CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the LA Times, and a thousand other publications, it is a red badge of honor.
[01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:44.937]  It is good to be attacked by this scum.
[01:03:44.937 --> 01:03:48.278]  I want to open the phones up, first time callers, the first round of calls.
[01:03:48.278 --> 01:03:49.578]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:03:49.578 --> 01:03:49.618]  877-789-2539.
[01:03:57.574 --> 01:03:59.055]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:03:59.055 --> 01:04:00.576]  Again, first time callers 877-789-ALEX.
[01:04:00.576 --> 01:04:10.041]  Paul, we're lining those calls up.
[01:04:10.041 --> 01:04:12.222]  We got a bunch of epic videos and things to play.
[01:04:12.222 --> 01:04:16.905]  We'll get to all of them when we come back after this quick break.
[01:04:16.905 --> 01:04:24.509]  Reality is so much more incredible than what Madison Avenue and Wall Street and Hollywood and
[01:04:26.055 --> 01:04:29.838]  The Times Square mentality can even imagine.
[01:04:29.838 --> 01:04:37.665]  The world is so much bigger than just dominating fellow humans and treating them like chattel, like bricks to build a wall of enslavement.
[01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:50.777]  Humanity are burning souls ready to be empowered, ready to be turned loose, ready to be empowered, ready to be given the universe.
[01:04:51.946 --> 01:04:55.232]  And that's what these tyrants seek to shudder, and they will fail.
[01:04:55.232 --> 01:04:56.915]  Humanity will rise.
[01:04:59.073 --> 01:05:02.574]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:02.574 --> 01:05:10.817]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:05:10.817 --> 01:05:16.238]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:05:16.238 --> 01:05:18.759]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:05:18.759 --> 01:05:20.880]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[01:06:04.406 --> 01:06:07.447]  Big Brother!
[01:06:07.447 --> 01:06:11.968]  Help me, Big Brother!
[01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.068]  Big Brother!
[01:06:13.068 --> 01:06:14.209]  Big Brother!
[01:06:14.209 --> 01:06:21.430]  It is only fitting that a free scream should sound the alarm against those who would destroy freedom.
[01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:29.032]  For in its power to deceive and inflame, or enlighten and inspire, the motion picture has no equal.
[01:06:29.032 --> 01:06:30.173]  Big Brother!
[01:06:30.173 --> 01:06:31.453]  Big Brother!
[01:06:34.138 --> 01:06:35.719]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.719 --> 01:06:38.461]  This is the Sunday broadcast.
[01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:42.784]  We're here every Sunday.
[01:06:42.784 --> 01:06:47.508]  Every single Sunday from 2 to 4 p.m.
[01:06:47.508 --> 01:06:50.070]  in some time zones in Europe.
[01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:54.193]  I guess that would be 3 to 5 in the East.
[01:06:54.193 --> 01:06:58.096]  4 to 6 in the Central.
[01:06:58.096 --> 01:07:00.718]  That'd be 3 to 5 in the Mountain.
[01:07:02.315 --> 01:07:08.559]  And that'd be, I guess, two to four in the Pacific.
[01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:29.031]  We are going to be taking your phone calls on all the different issues I threw out in the first hour and going over a lot of other news, but there is a global group of private corporations that are insiders, that work through private central banks, who have unlimited currency and credit by fraud, who are waging war against real free market economies, and have decided to phase out
[01:07:29.591 --> 01:07:48.816]  The free market economy, first the industrial economy, then the service economy, and make us basically chattel welfare slaves either through corporate government or classical welfare systems to make us dependent so that we can go under true social engineering for population reduction and final extermination.
[01:07:48.816 --> 01:07:53.077]  And that's a huge statement there and it's totally true.
[01:07:53.894 --> 01:08:00.579]  And I'm just here warning you, and there's enough freedom and free speech left in the West that I'm able to even get this out.
[01:08:00.579 --> 01:08:01.981]  The system thinks you're done.
[01:08:01.981 --> 01:08:04.343]  They think you've rolled over to anything.
[01:08:04.343 --> 01:08:08.046]  In Germany, like I mentioned, they're trying to ban men standing up and urinating.
[01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:09.687]  That's Inder Spiegel.
[01:08:09.687 --> 01:08:13.130]  With a straight face, they say it hurts women, they can't stand and urinate.
[01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:16.873]  And if a woman can't do it, you shouldn't be able to do it.
[01:08:16.873 --> 01:08:17.813]  That's equality.
[01:08:17.813 --> 01:08:20.496]  That's tolerance.
[01:08:21.969 --> 01:08:27.797]  And state-run universities in Arizona are teaching all the problems are because of white people.
[01:08:27.797 --> 01:08:29.800]  And I mentioned that last hour.
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.602]  And you hear this stuff and it sounds crazy.
[01:08:31.602 --> 01:08:32.644]  It's meant to be crazy.
[01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:39.749]  Like Obama saying 2 plus 2 equals 5, and if you raise the debt limit it doesn't raise the debt.
[01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:46.872]  This is all meant just to get you ready to put up with anything they say, or MSNBC saying your kids don't belong to you, they belong to the state.
[01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:47.833]  Should I play that clip again?
[01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:52.175]  Or CBS News saying fluoride's good for your kids, or mercury's good for your kids.
[01:08:52.175 --> 01:08:53.456]  I mean, I could play all these clips again.
[01:08:54.136 --> 01:08:55.997]  We all know fluoride will kill you.
[01:08:55.997 --> 01:08:58.099]  We all know mercury will kill you.
[01:08:58.099 --> 01:09:05.143]  But it's part of them just, hey, pay us carbon taxes, even though plants live off carbon dioxide, or the earth will die.
[01:09:05.143 --> 01:09:08.605]  And why the earth's the coldest it's ever been, NASA said last week.
[01:09:08.605 --> 01:09:12.748]  Even though we've got record cold temperatures across the planet, AccuWeather.
[01:09:12.748 --> 01:09:16.650]  Tuesday, blizzard to bring New York City, Boston to stand still.
[01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:18.932]  The mayor of New York says maybe the worst to ever hit.
[01:09:21.377 --> 01:09:24.299]  Meanwhile, more homeless camps are appearing beyond downtown L.A.
[01:09:24.299 --> 01:09:26.621]  Skid Row.
[01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:26.841]  L.A.
[01:09:26.841 --> 01:09:29.683]  Times reports, but they claim California has the best economy ever.
[01:09:29.683 --> 01:09:36.388]  Oh man, they're opening the borders wide open.
[01:09:36.388 --> 01:09:39.571]  Let me go further here before I go to your phone calls.
[01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:44.975]  When the president, without even an executive order, but just by fiat, opens the borders up,
[01:09:45.856 --> 01:09:55.369]  and legalizes all the illegals, or turns off our power plants, or puts our military under UN control, or persecutes the Tea Party, or the Christian groups of the IRS.
[01:09:55.369 --> 01:09:59.474]  Do you understand if they get away with that, they can do anything?
[01:09:59.474 --> 01:10:02.498]  And Congress
[01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:07.514]  Passed in the House last year a ban on partial birth abortion.
[01:10:07.514 --> 01:10:11.115]  They couldn't even do it now that the Republicans have a bigger majority.
[01:10:11.115 --> 01:10:12.376]  You know why?
[01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:18.737]  Because before the Republican House could pass the bill and blame it on the Democrats voting it down in the Senate.
[01:10:18.737 --> 01:10:28.260]  But now that it came down to actually banning partial birth abortion of 8 and 9 month old babies that could be just delivered and adopted on the spot.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.401]  Now that true unequivocal murder could have been banned.
[01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:34.171]  The House couldn't pass it.
[01:10:34.171 --> 01:10:42.094]  Because, see, that would have exposed the Senate that now has a Republican majority as traitors.
[01:10:42.094 --> 01:10:47.296]  So, see, electing more Republicans means we can't pass abortion bans.
[01:10:47.296 --> 01:10:52.199]  Because it shows you who the wolves in sheep's clothing are.
[01:10:52.199 --> 01:10:52.879]  That's good, though!
[01:10:53.848 --> 01:10:56.429]  You had a major political realignment.
[01:10:56.429 --> 01:10:58.530]  Democrats voting for Republicans.
[01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:00.650]  Because they wanted to get the economy going.
[01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:01.951]  They were against abortion.
[01:11:01.951 --> 01:11:04.052]  They were against open borders.
[01:11:04.052 --> 01:11:08.873]  When you give the illegals all this free stuff, but you can't get that if you go to third world countries.
[01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:10.714]  They can come here, but we can't go there.
[01:11:10.714 --> 01:11:13.795]  Everybody gets it!
[01:11:13.795 --> 01:11:18.577]  And so because we are winning hearts and minds, because people are waking up to what's happening,
[01:11:23.579 --> 01:11:28.723]  Now, Boehner, who attacks Obama in speeches, I predicted that, it wasn't hard to do.
[01:11:28.723 --> 01:11:34.707]  He won't, though, even start or allow the bills, there's dozens of them, to repeal parts or all of Obamacare.
[01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:42.532]  It's totally unpopular, totally criminal, has death panels, increases prices, has all these taxes on poor people.
[01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.814]  Can't happen.
[01:11:44.814 --> 01:11:48.877]  Can't have an IRS investigation of them persecuting people, that's all admitted.
[01:11:48.877 --> 01:11:50.538]  Can't have a Benghazi investigation.
[01:11:51.499 --> 01:11:57.161]  Can't have a Fast and Furious investigation?
[01:11:57.161 --> 01:12:04.744]  Because people like John Boehner are set to make tens of millions a year just on their insurance company investments they voted on.
[01:12:04.744 --> 01:12:09.146]  And just in 2014, insurance company profits.
[01:12:09.146 --> 01:12:09.786]  Worldwide.
[01:12:11.752 --> 01:12:14.834]  We're up 47% just off U.S.
[01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:15.894]  profits.
[01:12:15.894 --> 01:12:17.075]  And if you look at just U.S.
[01:12:17.075 --> 01:12:20.717]  subsidiaries, they're up 200 plus percent.
[01:12:20.717 --> 01:12:21.138]  Look it up!
[01:12:21.138 --> 01:12:23.459]  In fact, guys, people won't believe me if they're a TV viewer.
[01:12:23.459 --> 01:12:28.922]  Infowars.com forward slash show, just to obnoxiously show everything that we talk about on screen.
[01:12:28.922 --> 01:12:32.824]  Type in insurance company profits up 47% under Obamacare.
[01:12:32.824 --> 01:12:35.406]  Let's give them a New York Times or Wall Street Journal on that one.
[01:12:37.503 --> 01:12:43.839]  But it's 200 plus percent just here, cause gang rapin' you is fun for them.
[01:12:43.839 --> 01:12:46.946]  The dumbasses that were out there and supported it, excuse my French.
[01:12:48.268 --> 01:12:58.555]  Really thought that the government insurance companies that were lobbying for it wanted to give you increased, at a 40% slip, lowered prices.
[01:12:58.555 --> 01:13:00.737]  Or wanted to give you something free.
[01:13:00.737 --> 01:13:07.262]  And you got all these poor people out there that never knew they could get charity care or free health care under federal law at these hospitals, these charity hospitals.
[01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:09.724]  They're all lined up around the block bankrupting things right now.
[01:13:10.504 --> 01:13:21.712]  Like it's some kind of new fancy rich guy thing to go in and get surgery or whatever in these flesh-eating bacteria factories they call hospitals.
[01:13:21.712 --> 01:13:30.357]  And our country's media is so controlled that even Forbes admitted there are Ebola cases around the country that have been covered up.
[01:13:30.357 --> 01:13:32.779]  That's what it is to be a slave though.
[01:13:32.779 --> 01:13:34.220]  A slave to the complexity.
[01:13:35.984 --> 01:13:44.547]  Because most men that are intelligent decide to go game the system somewhere where they can make money gaming the system.
[01:13:44.547 --> 01:13:45.607]  There's the New York Times.
[01:13:45.607 --> 01:13:51.809]  Cost of coverage under Affordable Care Act increases in 2015.
[01:13:51.809 --> 01:13:58.331]  Yeah, that's an article about just Google, just search engine, insurance companies get record profits under Obamacare.
[01:13:58.331 --> 01:13:59.271]  That'll give you the 47% 2014 number.
[01:14:02.642 --> 01:14:03.703]  That's globally, though.
[01:14:03.703 --> 01:14:10.349]  Insurance companies, globally, 47% increase.
[01:14:10.349 --> 01:14:11.470]  They wrote the bill.
[01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:17.475]  They had bipartisan Republican support, and the Republicans won't repeal it right now.
[01:14:17.475 --> 01:14:20.958]  But the Democrats will get up and say, Republicans don't want it because they're racist.
[01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:23.020]  They wrote the stinking thing.
[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:28.745]  The rhino, neocon, John Boehner, pieces of trash wrote it.
[01:14:30.359 --> 01:14:39.845]  With the Democrats, like Ezekiel Emanuel, who went on Fox News and said, yeah, this is meant to bankrupt healthcare and bring in total control on a single payer.
[01:14:39.845 --> 01:14:43.087]  It'll still be administered, though, by private interest.
[01:14:43.087 --> 01:14:54.213]  When they're done, you'll pay five times what you did, and then they'll deny you care, and you're gonna love it, because you don't even have a memory, if you're a new listener out there, of how your prices went up.
[01:14:54.213 --> 01:14:56.615]  Yeah, there's Forbes headline.
[01:14:56.615 --> 01:14:58.656]  Profits in health insurance under Obama.
[01:15:00.356 --> 01:15:04.940]  And then it goes into, so that's a 2013 showing massive increase.
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.281]  I'll find it during the break and show, folks.
[01:15:06.281 --> 01:15:08.783]  You guys are doing great, but I'll find it.
[01:15:08.783 --> 01:15:10.924]  So I covered it out of an AP article.
[01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:19.150]  There was a Japan Times article, too, last week that said the 40, I think they said 49% actually in that article.
[01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:20.331]  It's gotta be fun, though.
[01:15:20.331 --> 01:15:27.257]  You just go lobby, and people like my folks or myself see a doubling the last two years in their prices.
[01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:29.872]  But we're all just individuals.
[01:15:29.872 --> 01:15:31.153]  We're all conspiracy theorists.
[01:15:31.153 --> 01:15:34.573]  You know, that's all just a Republican talking point, even though they wrote the bill.
[01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:37.154]  The Republicans did.
[01:15:37.154 --> 01:15:42.455]  We're going to come back and take your phone calls, and then we're going to look at what's happening in Greece, what's happening in China.
[01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:44.716]  Big economic implosions there.
[01:15:44.716 --> 01:15:48.737]  Oh, ex-spies infiltrate Hollywood as espionage TV shows and movies multiply.
[01:15:48.737 --> 01:15:51.918]  That was the law changed last year to allow the CIA to run the media.
[01:15:51.918 --> 01:15:54.818]  They were already doing it, but now the gloves are off.
[01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:56.739]  That's all coming up out of the Washington Post.
[01:15:56.739 --> 01:15:57.259]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.898 --> 01:16:08.883]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation, the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock.
[01:16:08.883 --> 01:16:18.869]  This ultra-clean vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[01:16:19.429 --> 01:16:25.853]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:16:25.853 --> 01:16:32.257]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:16:32.257 --> 01:16:36.800]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.841]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process.
[01:16:40.841 --> 01:16:43.922]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:16:43.922 --> 01:16:45.462]  No needles, no injections.
[01:16:45.462 --> 01:16:46.842]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:16:46.842 --> 01:16:48.042]  Try it for yourself.
[01:16:48.042 --> 01:16:49.363]  Discover the secret.
[01:16:49.363 --> 01:16:50.463]  Secret 12.
[01:16:50.463 --> 01:16:52.804]  Supplies of Secret 12 are very limited.

[01:16:59.645 --> 01:17:00.666]  Alex Jones here.
[01:17:00.666 --> 01:17:09.836]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:17:09.836 --> 01:17:15.062]  So many other formulations out there contain toxic ingredients, synthetic additives, and even GMOs.
[01:17:15.382 --> 01:17:19.123]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[01:18:12.157 --> 01:18:19.241]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:19.942]  We're good to go.
[01:18:35.583 --> 01:18:39.404]  Lung Cleanse, Fluoride Shields, Oxy Powder.
[01:18:39.404 --> 01:18:50.206]  I believe that all of these products will blow you away like they've done the thousands of other customers that have visited Infowarslife.com and believed in us and tried the products.
[01:18:50.206 --> 01:18:57.828]  Folks, check out Infowarslife.com today and the entire line of groundbreaking, cutting-edge, hardcore products.
[01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:03.331]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:19:03.331 --> 01:19:07.612]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:19:07.612 --> 01:19:09.392]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:19:09.392 --> 01:19:17.254]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:18.395]  But for how long?
[01:19:18.395 --> 01:19:25.036]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:19:25.036 --> 01:19:27.857]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:19:29.224 --> 01:19:32.746]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:19:32.746 --> 01:19:40.990]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:46.392]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:19:46.392 --> 01:19:48.934]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:11.613]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.613 --> 01:20:20.136]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:20.136 --> 01:20:29.719]  Alright, let me boil it down again this way as an emergency alert transmission, then I'll go to your phone calls in the next segment.
[01:20:29.719 --> 01:20:30.900]  More news that I haven't hit yet.
[01:20:32.091 --> 01:20:34.934]  And it's this.
[01:20:34.934 --> 01:20:40.138]  You can't blame the technocratic, eugenicist, globalist elite for everything that's happening.
[01:20:40.138 --> 01:20:56.113]  The West and freedom, freedom compared to other countries and other cultures, nothing was perfect, created such fabulous wealth and power that we became decadent and slovenly.
[01:20:56.113 --> 01:20:58.175]  And now I look at the totalitarian left
[01:20:59.005 --> 01:21:03.629]  That thinks men wearing pants is evil and men standing to urinate is evil.
[01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:04.930]  This is in the news.
[01:21:04.930 --> 01:21:11.436]  And that have anti-white studies being taught by white professors everywhere to create racial division and hatred.
[01:21:11.436 --> 01:21:14.719]  Who cover up black-on-white crime happening all over the country.
[01:21:14.719 --> 01:21:21.004]  It's the George Soros model to spend $33 million funding anti-police riots all over the country.
[01:21:21.004 --> 01:21:22.406]  Does that endorse the police state?
[01:21:22.406 --> 01:21:25.949]  No, it legitimizes it by attacking the police wrongly.
[01:21:29.366 --> 01:21:34.830]  The plan is to get us all at each other's throats while we're swindled.
[01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:46.419]  And under the New World Order, you will lose your pension funds, you will lose your 401ks, you will lose your basic dignity, you will become a prisoner.
[01:21:46.419 --> 01:21:50.782]  That's the model that the TSA is training us to convert to.
[01:21:50.782 --> 01:21:52.243]  This is happening all over the world.
[01:21:52.243 --> 01:21:53.504]  This is stated.
[01:21:53.504 --> 01:21:57.647]  We're going into bondage, but high-tech, creeping incremental.
[01:21:59.175 --> 01:22:00.977]  But now it's accelerating.
[01:22:00.977 --> 01:22:07.222]  And I, for one, don't want to be part of this.
[01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:17.210]  Most of the people that work for the system are destroying their own futures going along with it, but they're compartmentalized and they need that paycheck.
[01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:19.833]  The answer is don't go along with this.
[01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:20.893]  Say no.
[01:22:20.893 --> 01:22:23.676]  There's major resistance already organically to it.
[01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:40.282]  I'm going to go to Aaron and Rick and Gerald and Gerald, two Geralds, Gerald in Arkansas and Texas, side by side, David and Todd and Cereo, Chase, Ash, Robert, Bob, and others.
[01:22:40.282 --> 01:22:46.547]  Briefly, we have a new introduction to the InfoWarsLife.com family of high-quality nutraceuticals.
[01:22:46.547 --> 01:22:52.973]  And just as we have 25% off the introductory offer for Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Boost,
[01:22:54.042 --> 01:22:58.145]  We have that going right now until supplies sell out, which is very, very soon.
[01:22:58.145 --> 01:23:02.948]  We have a limited supply of a test of oil of oregano, truly organic.
[01:23:02.948 --> 01:23:06.330]  And I don't like taking it in my mouth, because it burns my mouth.
[01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:09.772]  Since Roman times, they've known what it's done for people's health.
[01:23:09.772 --> 01:23:15.296]  Well, here's a basic introduction to the New Info Wars Life oil of oregano formulation.
[01:23:16.345 --> 01:23:17.506]  Introductory price of $19.95.
[01:23:17.506 --> 01:23:20.187]  That's $10 off.
[01:23:20.187 --> 01:23:27.952]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of the key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:23:27.952 --> 01:23:32.915]  Used as far back as the Roman Empire to support the body's natural digestive systems and enhance health.
[01:23:32.915 --> 01:23:40.840]  The new era of super high-powered oregano oil has arrived, wild-crafted from the true Mediterranean oregano species.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.782]  That's a big difference than a lot of the fake stuff out there.
[01:23:43.782 --> 01:23:45.083]  Oreganum vulgare.
[01:23:45.683 --> 01:23:49.864]  Which is considered to be one of the most active oregano plants.
[01:23:49.864 --> 01:24:04.228]  Standardized 70% Infowars Life Oil of Oregano contains 45 milligram capsules that can be taken one or three times a day, 60 capsules per bottle.
[01:24:04.228 --> 01:24:06.828]  I just said, hey, I like to take high quality oregano.
[01:24:06.828 --> 01:24:09.209]  It burns my throat, it's terrible.
[01:24:09.209 --> 01:24:12.210]  I looked into caplets, it gets deeper into the stomach so you don't have
[01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:13.557]  Thank you.
[01:24:30.885 --> 01:24:33.006]  I've basically laid out what's going on.
[01:24:33.006 --> 01:24:42.653]  There is a takeover of society by special interests at every level, where it's about running the system, not getting there because you have the best idea or products.
[01:24:42.653 --> 01:24:55.841]  We're going into a totalitarian system, out of a free market system, that wishes to use poverty and ignorance as the new system, where regression, not progression, is the way.
[01:24:55.841 --> 01:24:57.622]  The Patriot Act is called patriotic.
[01:24:57.622 --> 01:24:58.523]  It's the opposite of that.
[01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:02.791]  All these other bills have the opposite use.
[01:25:02.791 --> 01:25:06.754]  Well, the progressives call themselves progressives?
[01:25:06.754 --> 01:25:08.295]  We think of the word progressive as good.
[01:25:08.295 --> 01:25:11.778]  Well, if cancer is progressing, is it good?
[01:25:11.778 --> 01:25:14.160]  If diabetes is progressing, is it good?
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.504]  If Parkinson's is progressing, is it good?
[01:25:18.504 --> 01:25:19.805]  We always hear about reform.
[01:25:21.394 --> 01:25:23.055]  Is reform always good?
[01:25:23.055 --> 01:25:23.955]  Well, yeah.
[01:25:23.955 --> 01:25:24.696]  I've said this many times.
[01:25:24.696 --> 01:25:30.458]  If I stick my hand in a blender and hit it on high, it's going to reform my fingers into a bloody paste.
[01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:32.899]  Is that reform good?
[01:25:32.899 --> 01:25:36.141]  Well, maybe if I'm going to use it as fish food.
[01:25:36.141 --> 01:25:38.022]  These are the games they play.
[01:25:38.022 --> 01:25:42.764]  And they've got these hordes of just empty trendies infesting everything that have no ideas.
[01:25:42.764 --> 01:25:44.324]  They're not intellectuals.
[01:25:44.324 --> 01:25:46.465]  They're fascists, really.
[01:25:46.465 --> 01:25:50.007]  But they believe they're liberal in their vicious ignorance.
[01:25:52.159 --> 01:25:52.479]  Dittos, Alex.
[01:25:52.479 --> 01:25:53.380]  I wanted to say that the college
[01:26:11.442 --> 01:26:15.265]  The community college deal is already a scam.
[01:26:15.265 --> 01:26:23.270]  If they get their hands on it, they're just going to twist it into a mindless extension of what a high school already is.
[01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:31.135]  I went there, took a course, a multicultural studies course, to learn about the beauty of other cultures, and no, you are spot on.
[01:26:31.135 --> 01:26:36.579]  It was a course all about how white people are bad, we've destroyed civilization and the world.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:55.923]  Well, I mean, let's just face it, a lot of cultures in Asia contributed to science, and everybody contributed, but my God, I mean, the West made civilization what it is today, and every other culture adopted it because it was the most efficient and dominant, and absolutely, it's a threat.
[01:26:55.923 --> 01:26:58.924]  It's Renaissance, so it's under attack.
[01:26:58.924 --> 01:27:05.605]  The elite want the fruits of the Renaissance, but while denying us all, and by the way, this is in major news.
[01:27:06.485 --> 01:27:08.671]  Hating Whitey, that's the name of the course.
[01:27:08.671 --> 01:27:12.020]  Arizona has a course on how whites are bad.
[01:27:14.838 --> 01:27:16.819]  Oh, one last quick suggestion.
[01:27:16.819 --> 01:27:35.292]  I know you're working hard, sir, but instead of pressuring to release the Obama Deception 2 as a full movie, I was thinking maybe it would be perhaps less of a strain on you and more of a promotion for your new satellite uplinks coming up if you kind of released it episodically and just kind of broke it in a part.
[01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:36.052]  That's a great idea.
[01:27:36.052 --> 01:27:39.835]  We could have the first month we go on a bunch of satellite uplinks that are ready right now.
[01:27:39.835 --> 01:27:43.578]  I'm just going to pull the trigger and then have it maybe in a 10-part series.
[01:27:44.318 --> 01:27:47.979]  Maybe I could release the two or three Obama deception twos I made, but never finished.
[01:27:47.979 --> 01:27:49.380]  Because they're not always updated.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:51.761]  Probably ten hours long right now.
[01:27:51.761 --> 01:27:55.482]  You just hit on something really smart.
[01:27:55.482 --> 01:27:56.723]  I gotta hand it to you, brother.
[01:27:56.723 --> 01:27:57.103]  Good job.
[01:27:57.103 --> 01:27:58.183]  That's why I love taking calls.
[01:27:58.183 --> 01:27:59.004]  Thank you for bringing that up.
[01:27:59.004 --> 01:27:59.424]  Anything else?
[01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:06.896]  No, you're doing a great job, and for all the listeners who are on the fence about your products, make the move.
[01:28:06.896 --> 01:28:11.622]  I was pleasantly pleased with everything I've gotten from you, and I'm trying the Ancient Defense.
[01:28:11.622 --> 01:28:12.703]  It's coming in the mail now.
[01:28:12.703 --> 01:28:13.744]  Thank you very much, guys.
[01:28:13.744 --> 01:28:16.307]  Let me ask you briefly, what was your favorite product?
[01:28:16.307 --> 01:28:19.330]  Did you try the Nutraceuticals, or was it a ProGun t-shirt?
[01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:19.751]  What was it?
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:23.701]  I started with the Iodine, moved on to the X2.
[01:28:23.701 --> 01:28:25.422]  It was even better.
[01:28:25.422 --> 01:28:28.403]  The Supermail Vitality has probably been my favorite.
[01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:28.683]  Oh yeah.
[01:28:28.683 --> 01:28:32.424]  The Lung Cleanse was excellent, and the Oxy Powder, you're spot on.
[01:28:32.424 --> 01:28:33.744]  You're a game changer.
[01:28:33.744 --> 01:28:35.425]  That has helped clean my digestion.
[01:28:35.425 --> 01:28:36.205]  Thank you.

[01:28:39.666 --> 01:28:48.449]  And yeah, to quote Mike Judge, Supermail Vitality is all about energy stamina, but it's all about boing, boing, boing.
[01:28:48.449 --> 01:28:49.970]  I mean, it is boing, boing, boing.
[01:28:50.370 --> 01:28:55.260]  I don't know if people know what that means, but let's just say that, uh, let's just say it's dramatic.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.062]  It is dramatic.
[01:28:56.062 --> 01:28:57.064]  It's the real deal.
[01:28:57.064 --> 01:28:57.424]  Stay with us.

[01:31:33.144 --> 01:31:37.427]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.

[01:33:14.934 --> 01:33:20.975]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:20.975 --> 01:33:24.296]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.296 --> 01:33:26.236]  Right now, the big top millionaires
[01:33:28.536 --> 01:33:31.857]  Rockefeller, the Rothschilds, Bill Gates, all of them.
[01:33:31.857 --> 01:33:39.660]  Ted Turner announcing global government and global taxation and global regulation and Al Gore wants 90 trillion.
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.462]  The other group wants 100 trillion to fund the world government, but it doesn't exist!
[01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:51.397]  I want to go to Rick and Gerald and Gerald and David and Todd and Skiro and Chase and Ash and Robert, Bob, Jerry.
[01:33:51.397 --> 01:33:53.259]  In fact, I'm going to give each person a minute.
[01:33:53.259 --> 01:33:54.140]  Just move to the next person.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:57.822]  I want to take a lot of calls here on the time we have left today.
[01:33:57.822 --> 01:34:01.325]  China's going into depression, The Guardian reports.
[01:34:01.325 --> 01:34:06.389]  They just voted in a coalition government in Greece not to pay the banker bailouts.
[01:34:06.389 --> 01:34:07.250]  They're spending that.
[01:34:08.484 --> 01:34:10.386]  As if the left has come to power.
[01:34:10.386 --> 01:34:25.120]  And it is a leftist coalition with some other groups, but the left, along with the so-called right, is always pushing the welfare state that gets people tied into this system that's unsustainable by design.
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.001]  Let's go to Rick in Wisconsin.
[01:34:27.001 --> 01:34:28.162]  You're on the air.
[01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:28.463]  Go ahead.
[01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:35.158]  I have two points for you real quick.
[01:34:35.158 --> 01:34:39.444]  Everybody should call their congressman and get the 28 pages of the secret 9-11.
[01:34:41.318 --> 01:34:43.300]  A case that's been released to Congress?
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:57.710]  Sure, I agree, but listen, we've already had Bob Graham, the head of the Commission, Senator Graham and others, and Congressman Jones on his Reddit, say that it shows a NORAD stand down, and that Saudi Arabia ran the attacks, which we already knew.
[01:34:57.710 --> 01:35:00.012]  The media hasn't covered Bob Graham saying that.
[01:35:00.012 --> 01:35:04.575]  I mean, a couple news stories, so it could come out our government ran the whole attack.
[01:35:04.575 --> 01:35:07.598]  The media wouldn't cover it, so what do you do about that?
[01:35:07.598 --> 01:35:10.460]  I'm going to put it in our local paper if I can get it from my Congressman.
[01:35:10.968 --> 01:35:12.309]  Absolutely, that's a good idea.
[01:35:12.309 --> 01:35:16.910]  What do you make of that 28 pages?
[01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:19.271]  I think it'll set the world on fire.
[01:35:19.271 --> 01:35:25.994]  No, I agree, but we're gonna have to push it over the top and that's why they don't want a real grassroots media to take things like that and get it out.
[01:35:25.994 --> 01:35:32.777]  But isn't it already bombshell that people have gone public about what's in the 28 pages?
[01:35:32.777 --> 01:35:35.538]  Right, and also I wanted you to
[01:35:37.236 --> 01:35:43.782]  Let everybody know about David Crowley's execution, the creator of the Great Escape.
[01:35:43.782 --> 01:35:48.726]  Well, we did cover that last week, and it looks like another assassination of somebody in the media.
[01:35:48.726 --> 01:36:00.796]  Just like this prosecutor in Argentina who said, they're trying to kill me, I'm about to give a speech in two hours, proving that the president carried out staged bombings, and he was now, they admit, murdered.
[01:36:00.796 --> 01:36:01.697]  He was executed.
[01:36:01.697 --> 01:36:04.760]  He was shot in the head, all three of them, him and his wife and his daughter.
[01:36:05.650 --> 01:36:08.631]  I know, and so was the prosecutor.
[01:36:08.631 --> 01:36:14.414]  And the president said it was a conspiracy theory, but now they admit he was murdered, the prosecutor.
[01:36:14.414 --> 01:36:16.375]  A lot of people are getting killed right now.
[01:36:16.375 --> 01:36:20.756]  Death of prosecutor shakes faith in president and government institutions in Argentina.
[01:36:20.756 --> 01:36:22.037]  Fox News.
[01:36:22.037 --> 01:36:22.737]  Here's another one.
[01:36:22.737 --> 01:36:23.418]  AFP.
[01:36:23.418 --> 01:36:25.799]  Argentine prosecutor shot point blank in forehead.
[01:36:25.799 --> 01:36:28.440]  So, there you go.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.541]  They're just murdering people.
[01:36:30.541 --> 01:36:32.341]  Let's go to Gerald in Arkansas.
[01:36:32.341 --> 01:36:33.362]  Gerald, you're on the air.
[01:36:33.362 --> 01:36:33.662]  Welcome.
[01:36:34.793 --> 01:36:37.617]  Hey, Alex, yeah, you're the man.
[01:36:37.617 --> 01:36:39.479]  I am a retired former Marine.
[01:36:39.479 --> 01:36:41.983]  I've served under JFK.
[01:36:41.983 --> 01:36:44.106]  I've done my homework, Alex, like you have.
[01:36:44.106 --> 01:36:46.369]  I follow the real truth.
[01:36:46.369 --> 01:36:50.394]  You're the only one I know, and I've listened to all these other blowhards.
[01:36:50.394 --> 01:36:52.256]  They got a little bit of truth and a whole lot of BS.
[01:36:53.408 --> 01:37:09.834]  And so the real corporate we know is Satan the Devil, but as far as what really runs this whole system is the central banking systems beginning with 1913 Federal Reserve Act because without this phony fiat money they couldn't do any of this.
[01:37:10.672 --> 01:37:12.293]  Exactly.
[01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:14.195]  And again, it's called the Federal Reserve.
[01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:15.496]  It's private on record.
[01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:17.557]  It controls the money.
[01:37:17.557 --> 01:37:19.399]  No wonder these guys have taken over.
[01:37:19.399 --> 01:37:20.840]  So what are they at war with?
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:23.922]  Any business, company they don't control.
[01:37:23.922 --> 01:37:26.864]  Because it's not enough to have all the money in the world.
[01:37:26.864 --> 01:37:32.668]  They want to get rid of their competition.
[01:37:32.668 --> 01:37:33.289]  Anything else, sir?
[01:37:34.265 --> 01:37:38.109]  No, I would agree with you on that, but I will say this.
[01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:45.637]  The one thing that I don't hear hardly anybody talk about is the fact that we're still under common law.
[01:37:45.637 --> 01:37:46.198]  I agree.
[01:37:46.198 --> 01:37:49.702]  You can actually bring common law action against these people.
[01:37:49.702 --> 01:37:51.604]  There's ways to do it.
[01:37:51.604 --> 01:37:54.186]  It's still in effect under the Uniform Commercial Code.
[01:37:54.186 --> 01:37:55.708]  That's what's really running everything.
[01:37:56.008 --> 01:37:56.388]  I agree.
[01:37:56.388 --> 01:37:58.770]  Let me just add, common law, you see it every day.
[01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:01.791]  Magna Carta, Bill of Rights, Constitution's based on it.
[01:38:01.791 --> 01:38:03.232]  That's what a jury or grand jury is.
[01:38:03.232 --> 01:38:05.073]  That's what voting is.
[01:38:05.073 --> 01:38:07.914]  And a jury judges the facts as well as the law.
[01:38:07.914 --> 01:38:14.378]  So if you think somebody's being railroaded, you just no-bill them.
[01:38:14.378 --> 01:38:14.938]  God bless you.
[01:38:14.938 --> 01:38:15.798]  Good to hear from you.
[01:38:15.798 --> 01:38:16.519]  Another Gerald.
[01:38:16.519 --> 01:38:17.879]  That was Gerald in Arkansas.
[01:38:17.879 --> 01:38:19.140]  This is Gerald in Texas.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:20.081]  You're up next.
[01:38:20.081 --> 01:38:23.482]  Go ahead.
[01:38:23.482 --> 01:38:23.942]  Hello?
[01:38:23.942 --> 01:38:24.323]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:24.323 --> 01:38:24.623]  Go ahead.
[01:38:25.677 --> 01:38:29.340]  Hey, I wanted to tell you about a book that I've seen on the internet.
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:30.921]  It's called The Secret School of Wisdom.
[01:38:30.921 --> 01:38:32.142]  Are you familiar with this book?
[01:38:32.142 --> 01:38:33.564]  I am not.
[01:38:33.564 --> 01:38:41.570]  Okay, so it's supposed to be a translation of the Bavarian Illuminati ritual into English, like the whole thing?
[01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:48.356]  I know part of that was translated into a real book in 1798.
[01:38:48.356 --> 01:38:50.638]  Proves of this conspiracy.
[01:38:50.638 --> 01:38:52.039]  So I've read the Illuminati
[01:38:53.757 --> 01:38:55.518]  document that the Germans did get.
[01:38:55.518 --> 01:38:57.058]  That may be a republishing.
[01:38:57.058 --> 01:38:57.718]  What does it say?
[01:38:57.718 --> 01:38:59.899]  I can tell you if it's accurate or not.
[01:38:59.899 --> 01:39:01.880]  Well, get your guys to pull it up on Google.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:10.463]  It's put in the secret school of wisdom and it's being put out by this company called Lewis Masonic.
[01:39:10.463 --> 01:39:21.987]  It is a somewhat Masonic document because the Illuminati, George Washington wrote a bunch of letters against it, did try to take over both branches of Masonry, but
[01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:25.886]  Yeah, there it is, the Secret School of Wisdom.
[01:39:25.886 --> 01:39:29.168]  Yeah, I haven't read it, so I couldn't comment on it.
[01:39:29.168 --> 01:39:34.132]  Yeah, it's supposed to be coming out is what it says somewhere down on that page, and I think there's... Well, it's already come out.
[01:39:34.132 --> 01:39:35.453]  They had a German trial.
[01:39:35.453 --> 01:39:37.275]  It's all public, sir.
[01:39:37.275 --> 01:39:41.198]  You can read free online proves of this conspiracy.
[01:39:41.198 --> 01:39:43.820]  You don't have to pay for it.
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:44.100]  Oh, okay.
[01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:52.749]  Yeah, there was a Masonic, anti-Masonic party that was as big as the Democrats for a while, because they caught Masons killing a bunch of people.
[01:39:52.749 --> 01:39:55.371]  I'm not anti-Mason, but it was a group within the Masons.
[01:39:55.371 --> 01:40:05.676]  Criminal groups can use any secret society or organization to carry out operations, and they pretty much, Masonry has been taken over by the Bavarian Illuminati.
[01:40:06.676 --> 01:40:09.458]  They promised to empower humanity.
[01:40:09.458 --> 01:40:11.619]  They got good people to join them, believing that.
[01:40:11.619 --> 01:40:21.644]  But at the heart of it, it's a wicked takeover, not to get rid of existing systems of control, but to overthrow those and create total control.
[01:40:21.644 --> 01:40:22.685]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:22.685 --> 01:40:23.685]  Very interesting.
[01:40:23.685 --> 01:40:25.006]  David in California.
[01:40:25.006 --> 01:40:25.967]  David, you're on the air.
[01:40:25.967 --> 01:40:26.287]  Welcome.
[01:40:27.802 --> 01:40:28.743]  Yeah, welcome to you.
[01:40:28.743 --> 01:40:33.568]  You know, I'll never forget April 19th, 1995 with Oklahoma City.
[01:40:33.568 --> 01:40:46.921]  And I don't know if it was you or Michael Savage or one of the good talk show hosts, somebody said that Terry Nichols signed a sworn affidavit that said Larry Potts, who was second in command in the FBI, was over the whole
[01:40:47.341 --> 01:41:08.881]  That's right, and then Potts denied it, and then WorldNetDaily got the tax receipts of him there the day before at the Marriott, and I've interviewed the people in the building, police officers that showed up five minutes after, Don Browning, can't talk to Terrence Yakey, they murdered him, tortured him to death, and yeah, we actually know the names of all those involved, yeah.
[01:41:10.234 --> 01:41:13.077]  Larry, the Lamb of God is watching you.
[01:41:13.077 --> 01:41:14.498]  He's going to get you.
[01:41:14.498 --> 01:41:16.540]  Okay, well I don't want to mess with these gangsters.
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:20.984]  I mean, it's enough to even sit there and talk about this stuff.
[01:41:20.984 --> 01:41:23.707]  But yeah, we know the names of the FBI and BATF people.
[01:41:23.707 --> 01:41:26.369]  That's why they don't want us on the air across the country.
[01:41:26.369 --> 01:41:28.672]  The average FBI is not bad people.
[01:41:28.672 --> 01:41:31.594]  The ATF blew the whistle on Fast and Furious.
[01:41:31.594 --> 01:41:34.217]  It's evil people using organizations to do this.
[01:41:35.676 --> 01:41:39.238]  It's not going to get us anywhere just hating an organization.
[01:41:39.238 --> 01:41:44.262]  It's just, my God, I mean, this world government comes in, nobody's got a future.
[01:41:44.262 --> 01:41:50.285]  I mean, that's the big joke here, is that black, white, cop, not cop, it doesn't matter.
[01:41:50.285 --> 01:41:51.706]  Tyranny is taking over.
[01:41:51.706 --> 01:41:55.228]  It's using high-tech systems to divert the public.
[01:41:55.228 --> 01:41:57.430]  Todd in Florida, you got one minute, we're going to break, go ahead.
[01:41:58.954 --> 01:41:59.835]  I bet, though.
[01:41:59.835 --> 01:42:03.558]  Juan Gonzalez, how you doing, brother?
[01:42:03.558 --> 01:42:12.645]  I joined the Army back in 79 with the Fort Knox in the fall of 79, and those vaccines almost killed me.
[01:42:12.645 --> 01:42:15.968]  They did kill one of my platoon members.
[01:42:15.968 --> 01:42:19.671]  Oh yeah, they generally kill people in the shot lineup, and it's all lovingly covered up, yep.
[01:42:20.782 --> 01:42:24.584]  I had Guillain-Barré for 25 years and didn't know what it was.
[01:42:24.584 --> 01:42:30.268]  Anyway, dude, I wanted to do what you're doing before you started doing it.
[01:42:30.268 --> 01:42:31.448]  Hold on, I'm not going to cut you off.
[01:42:31.448 --> 01:42:33.930]  I want to hear about the Guillain-Barré and have you finish your story, Todd.
[01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:37.332]  Then we'll go to Scrio, I believe.
[01:42:37.332 --> 01:42:41.214]  Ciro, Chase, Ash, Robert, Bob, Jerry, and that should be it.
[01:42:41.214 --> 01:42:42.655]  But Todd, stay there.
[01:42:42.655 --> 01:42:44.196]  Yeah, I know two local talk show hosts.
[01:42:45.216 --> 01:42:49.483]  They had their hands and feet go numb after the flu shot six years ago, the H1N1.
[01:42:49.483 --> 01:42:52.709]  And one of them got in my face about it and said, I don't care if I went numb.
[01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:55.935]  They were just like, so what?
[01:42:55.935 --> 01:42:57.718]  Well, some people go numb and quit breathing.
[01:42:59.727 --> 01:43:03.230]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:11.476]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:43:11.476 --> 01:43:16.900]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:44:19.031 --> 01:44:25.096]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.

[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.902]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.

[01:45:30.581 --> 01:45:33.402]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:45:33.402 --> 01:45:35.362]  They are never going to stop.

[01:47:25.468 --> 01:47:28.110]  By the way, the video's up on Infowars.com.
[01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:29.011]  I'm not going to play it.
[01:47:29.011 --> 01:47:31.312]  If you're ready and want to go see it, you can.

[01:47:32.774 --> 01:47:35.196]  A supposed terrorist attacked a bunch of stuff.
[01:47:35.196 --> 01:47:37.538]  And we're fighting Russians over there.
[01:47:37.538 --> 01:47:41.761]  It's so immoral why our government funds radical Islamists.
[01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:43.562]  The Russians are not offensively doing anything.
[01:47:44.522 --> 01:47:45.763]  Don't want to move there?
[01:47:45.763 --> 01:47:46.983]  Are the Russian government corrupt?
[01:47:46.983 --> 01:47:48.804]  Yeah, but not compared to our government.
[01:47:48.804 --> 01:47:51.506]  It's a fact.
[01:47:51.506 --> 01:47:54.428]  German court rules men can urinate while standing.
[01:47:54.428 --> 01:47:55.488]  You gotta go read this.
[01:47:55.488 --> 01:47:58.290]  I mean, this is political correctness.
[01:47:58.290 --> 01:47:59.591]  You can commit any crime you want.
[01:47:59.591 --> 01:48:02.712]  You can be an illegal alien and drive with no driver's license, because that's politically correct.
[01:48:02.712 --> 01:48:05.394]  But if you stand while urinating, you're in big trouble.
[01:48:05.394 --> 01:48:08.496]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:48:08.496 --> 01:48:10.277]  ISIS murders Japanese hostages.
[01:48:11.698 --> 01:48:16.962]  We just proved last week, even Saturday Night Live retweeted our video, that it was a fake video.
[01:48:16.962 --> 01:48:18.043]  You see the blue screen.
[01:48:18.043 --> 01:48:19.744]  I mean, who knows what's real anymore?
[01:48:19.744 --> 01:48:21.065]  It's really getting crazy.
[01:48:21.065 --> 01:48:22.386]  Todd, finishing up your point.
[01:48:22.386 --> 01:48:26.409]  You say you were in the military, took vaccines, had Guillain-Barré for 20 plus years.
[01:48:26.409 --> 01:48:26.750]  Go ahead.
[01:48:28.132 --> 01:48:35.298]  That's funny, I've taught more than one woman how to pee standing up.
[01:48:35.298 --> 01:48:38.741]  I couldn't feel my feet for almost 25 years.
[01:48:38.741 --> 01:48:45.206]  My hands, I would wake up at night and just scream and they hurt so bad.
[01:48:45.206 --> 01:48:49.970]  And there were other even more horrible side effects from that stuff.
[01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:57.256]  My son has a two-year-old beautiful baby boy and I told him, buddy, if you let them stick a needle in him, I'm gonna stomp you down.
[01:48:59.305 --> 01:49:02.048]  Hey, let me get to your products.
[01:49:02.048 --> 01:49:05.751]  The Beyond Pain Tangerine just saved and changed my life.
[01:49:05.751 --> 01:49:07.953]  My hair color is coming back.
[01:49:07.953 --> 01:49:11.496]  I'm no longer a type 2 diabetic.
[01:49:11.496 --> 01:49:13.418]  The stuff is just incredible.
[01:49:13.418 --> 01:49:19.384]  The silver, I've got skin cancer from I don't know what, probably crap that I ate most of my life.
[01:49:20.425 --> 01:49:21.927]  I don't think so.
[01:49:38.823 --> 01:49:44.828]  Your phone's fading out, brother, but just, I mean, I didn't even start pulling the products, but I appreciate that, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:47.570]  The Biontang and Tangerine is at InfoWarsHealth.com.
[01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:49.031]  That's a longevity product.
[01:49:49.031 --> 01:49:53.354]  There's really 90 essential elements and minerals you need, not 60-something.
[01:49:53.354 --> 01:50:03.362]  And yeah, that's the thing Dr. Wallach talks about, is a lot of hair turning gray is either your body can't absorb a mineral or you have a deficiency of it, like copper, for one example.
[01:50:03.362 --> 01:50:04.863]  And yes, it's changed my life.
[01:50:04.863 --> 01:50:06.204]  I've lost 40-plus pounds.
[01:50:06.844 --> 01:50:08.344]  All of it together is amazing.
[01:50:08.344 --> 01:50:10.145]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:10.145 --> 01:50:10.865]  Thank you so much.
[01:50:10.865 --> 01:50:18.747]  And it varies person by person, but mainline medical science wants to cut on something and fix a problem.
[01:50:18.747 --> 01:50:25.649]  You're always hearing, we want to find the cure for breast cancer, not find why it's up 3,000 plus percent the last 50 years.
[01:50:25.649 --> 01:50:26.769]  Look it up.
[01:50:26.769 --> 01:50:28.370]  Why is it increasing?
[01:50:28.370 --> 01:50:31.991]  Well, glyphosates and things like that, they admit grow the tumors.
[01:50:31.991 --> 01:50:32.411]  Roundup.
[01:50:34.336 --> 01:50:37.378]  Women missing trace elements, women missing iodine.
[01:50:37.378 --> 01:50:43.442]  That's what the government back in the 20s ordered iodine put in the food, and then by the 60s ordered it taken out.
[01:50:43.442 --> 01:50:46.825]  They said, no, let's just put fluoride in instead, that's the bad halogen.
[01:50:46.825 --> 01:50:49.606]  Iodine's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[01:50:49.606 --> 01:50:51.027]  Just look into it, folks.
[01:50:51.027 --> 01:50:53.109]  They know what they're doing.
[01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:54.009]  It's very sick.
[01:50:54.009 --> 01:50:57.151]  We had good folks in the federal government up until the 60s, overall.
[01:50:57.151 --> 01:51:02.215]  I mean, they weren't perfect, but they were like, we have an iodine deficiency, it's causing cancer, you know, put it in there.
[01:51:04.121 --> 01:51:04.942]  Hey Alex, it's actually a Spiro.
[01:51:04.942 --> 01:51:05.482]  Like Spiro Agnew.
[01:51:05.482 --> 01:51:05.783]  That's fine.
[01:51:05.783 --> 01:51:08.265]  So I have a couple points I'd like to bring up.
[01:51:26.823 --> 01:51:37.751]  You know, we're hearing a lot about cyber security and cyber attacks and this and that, how vulnerable our... Right as they introduce all the new CISPA acts to take over the internet, yeah.
[01:51:37.751 --> 01:51:48.819]  Right, and we all know how corporate America has merged with the government in a lot of areas, you know, Google and Facebook and all this censorship that's going on.
[01:51:49.637 --> 01:51:55.660]  I want to let everybody know there's a platform out there called Zeekly TV that is independent.
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:00.623]  It's by the people, it's for the people, and they're not going to be bringing down your content.
[01:52:00.623 --> 01:52:04.285]  Sparrow, what's the name of that again?
[01:52:04.285 --> 01:52:05.866]  Zeekly TV.
[01:52:05.866 --> 01:52:06.326]  Z-E-E-K-L-Y.
[01:52:08.547 --> 01:52:09.528]  Yeah, that's what's beautiful.
[01:52:09.528 --> 01:52:18.960]  There are thousands of independent platforms that even carry our stuff, and I'll see some of them and they'll have hundreds of thousands of views on our videos, tens of millions on their overall platform.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:26.370]  Very exciting, because the more people putting out activist material, it makes it impossible for the system to censor it, basically.
[01:52:27.625 --> 01:52:33.208]  Yeah, it's a platform designed to go head-to-head with Google and with YouTube.
[01:52:33.208 --> 01:52:35.289]  And it's only going to get bigger and better.
[01:52:35.289 --> 01:52:40.892]  And speaking of YouTube, I wanted to ask you about a well-known YouTuber out there, Dabu7.
[01:52:40.892 --> 01:52:43.493]  Give your personal take on him.
[01:52:43.493 --> 01:52:44.673]  I just don't know what that is.
[01:52:44.673 --> 01:52:46.314]  I appreciate your call.
[01:52:46.314 --> 01:52:49.356]  There's so much stuff out there, I can't even keep track of it.
[01:52:49.356 --> 01:52:50.756]  Let's go to Chase in Texas.
[01:52:50.756 --> 01:52:51.537]  Chase, you're on the air.
[01:52:52.731 --> 01:52:59.414]  Well hey Alex, Spiro Agnew, that reminds me of a quote that he called the establishment on his way out during the Nixon administration.
[01:52:59.414 --> 01:53:02.476]  He called them a feat snobs and noddering nabobs.
[01:53:02.476 --> 01:53:03.496]  And that's really what they are.
[01:53:03.496 --> 01:53:07.598]  I remember that, a feat snobs and noddering nabobs.
[01:53:07.598 --> 01:53:14.101]  I think we need to kind of maybe just keep tagging them and put that jacket back on all these people that think they're better than everybody.
[01:53:14.101 --> 01:53:20.204]  But, you know, I'm kind of a C-Span junkie and I spent time watching that Freedom Summit this Saturday.
[01:53:20.706 --> 01:53:23.192]  And I kind of like what Ben Carson talks about.
[01:53:23.192 --> 01:53:24.996]  You know, I know he's red.
[01:53:26.312 --> 01:53:28.173]  How would you like Palin running as one of the VP candidates?
[01:53:28.173 --> 01:53:32.434]  That'd be pretty powerful to trump the whole fake woman vote, you know, for Hillary.
[01:53:32.434 --> 01:53:34.175]  Oh, we gotta vote, or you're not for a woman.
[01:53:34.175 --> 01:53:38.036]  I mean, Palin's not perfect, but she's a lot better than Jeb Bush.
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:58.602]  Brother, I'm off for it.
[01:53:58.602 --> 01:54:01.864]  I'm off for trying to actually win an election this time.
[01:54:01.864 --> 01:54:06.869]  But as we know... Yeah, I mean, you know Palin at least won't come after our guns and won't open our borders.
[01:54:06.869 --> 01:54:11.813]  I mean, look at how they demonize her and say she's dumb when she's super smart because, quote, she's a woman.
[01:54:11.813 --> 01:54:14.515]  See how the left attacks women when they don't play along their game?
[01:54:15.461 --> 01:54:16.141]  Oh, I know.
[01:54:16.141 --> 01:54:16.462]  I know.
[01:54:16.462 --> 01:54:17.402]  It's pitiful.
[01:54:17.402 --> 01:54:21.885]  And they turn it around on us just like they say, oh, y'all are racist.
[01:54:21.885 --> 01:54:22.686]  No, it's a joke.
[01:54:22.686 --> 01:54:23.887]  I don't buy it no more.
[01:54:23.887 --> 01:54:24.787]  I've been awake now.
[01:54:24.787 --> 01:54:29.830]  It's almost been like, at first when I started waking up, I was like, Johnny Five, more input, more input.
[01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:31.872]  And then it was like, man, I got to check out.
[01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:33.593]  I agree.
[01:54:33.593 --> 01:54:36.154]  At first you want more, then you freak out and want to check out.
[01:54:36.154 --> 01:54:39.155]  Then you start getting it and you realize, no, it's about humanity.
[01:54:39.155 --> 01:54:40.315]  You can't give up.
[01:54:40.315 --> 01:54:40.755]  God bless you.
[01:54:40.755 --> 01:54:41.936]  You've got to move quick.
[01:54:41.936 --> 01:54:43.476]  Ashton, Ontario, Canada.
[01:54:43.476 --> 01:54:44.137]  Thanks for calling.
[01:54:44.137 --> 01:54:46.257]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:54:46.257 --> 01:54:46.818]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:46.818 --> 01:54:49.339]  I'm a huge fan of your show.
[01:54:49.339 --> 01:54:50.339]  At first I didn't call her.
[01:54:50.339 --> 01:54:57.202]  I just had a question slash comment about Obama talking about like nuclear bombs going on in U.S.
[01:54:57.202 --> 01:54:57.562]  cities.
[01:54:58.354 --> 01:55:07.036]  And earlier I talked to you about how socialism and communism, they can destroy nations, and I think people are very well aware of it now.
[01:55:07.036 --> 01:55:18.799]  Yeah, Obama, about a month after we exposed that nukes were missing from Daesh, that same night they had Lindsey Graham, the Senator, come out and say, missing nukes, we're going to have the West, East Coast blown up.
[01:55:18.799 --> 01:55:20.879]  I mean, we really had this intel.
[01:55:20.879 --> 01:55:22.500]  You notice the base never denied it.
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:28.385]  Then Obama comes out a month later and says, I'm worried New York will be blown up by a rogue nuke.
[01:55:28.385 --> 01:55:33.470]  That's just the establishment threatening other groups that, hey, we're still in control.
[01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:35.513]  We'll do anything to stay in control.
[01:55:37.293 --> 01:55:38.754]  Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[01:55:38.754 --> 01:55:44.377]  And I think, like, if that happens, like, it's... 9-11 was a joke compared to that.
[01:55:44.377 --> 01:55:48.779]  And I think they're gonna, like, take away all our freedoms and censor all the information.
[01:55:48.779 --> 01:55:49.400]  Absolutely.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:57.464]  If you were these collectivist globalists, you'd set off a nuke, blame it on military personnel, to have a war against the military, and a Night of the Long Knives internal coup.
[01:55:57.464 --> 01:55:58.485]  And that's the larger plan.
[01:56:00.017 --> 01:56:01.579]  Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[01:56:01.579 --> 01:56:08.285]  And I just wanted to ask, like, what do you think, like, what are the signs to look out for to see, like, it's going to happen?
[01:56:08.285 --> 01:56:13.870]  Because when they're going to start losing their war on information, I think they're just going to go all nuts.
[01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:15.572]  And, you know, they would want a while.
[01:56:15.572 --> 01:56:16.813]  That's right.
[01:56:16.813 --> 01:56:22.638]  But their own aggregate breakdown analysis of media shows that they've already lost the info war.
[01:56:23.519 --> 01:56:29.740]  So it's not safe for them to stage more false flags because that could backfire even if they implement the internet kill switch.
[01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:33.221]  Robert has questions about vaccinations for his infant daughter.
[01:56:33.221 --> 01:56:37.922]  Bob saw Papa John's with license plate reading camera attack.
[01:56:37.922 --> 01:56:38.842]  Don't know what that means.
[01:56:38.842 --> 01:56:41.143]  Jerry lived in Saudi Arabia.
[01:56:41.143 --> 01:56:45.364]  Get all three of these people's numbers tomorrow on the weekday show 11 a.m.
[01:56:45.364 --> 01:56:46.284]  to 2 p.m.
[01:56:46.284 --> 01:56:49.365]  I will go to them first because I said I get to all the calls.
[01:56:49.365 --> 01:56:50.325]  I only got to about 12 calls.
[01:56:51.345 --> 01:56:52.986]  You can take 15 calls on the board.
[01:56:52.986 --> 01:56:53.927]  I didn't get to everybody.
[01:56:53.927 --> 01:56:58.151]  Actually, a few more called in after I hung up, so I got to most people.
[01:56:58.151 --> 01:57:01.854]  I'll call you tomorrow if you give us your number and want us to.
[01:57:01.854 --> 01:57:02.634]  I apologize.
[01:57:02.634 --> 01:57:04.596]  I want to answer those questions.
[01:57:04.596 --> 01:57:06.237]  Folks, I don't have all the answers.
[01:57:06.237 --> 01:57:07.778]  I don't claim to be the best guy around.
[01:57:07.778 --> 01:57:08.939]  I just want freedom.
[01:57:08.939 --> 01:57:13.503]  I don't want to manage crony capitalist insider mafia system to run things.
[01:57:13.503 --> 01:57:14.564]  Global government's here.
[01:57:14.564 --> 01:57:15.184]  It's taken over.
[01:57:16.065 --> 01:57:19.767]  Don't ever take for granted hearing this radio show in your area.

[01:57:38.877 --> 01:57:40.338]  That's the same way life works.
[01:57:41.539 --> 01:57:47.634]  You gotta make hay while the sun shines, and there's a battle going on worldwide for what will control the future destiny of the planet.
[01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:51.752]  The knowledge of the ancients.
