[00:00.000 --> 00:11.920]  This is Jakari Jackson for infowars.com.
[00:11.920 --> 00:16.200]  Last month, the Washington State Senate said open carriers are no longer welcome in their
[00:16.200 --> 00:17.720]  viewing galleries.
[00:17.720 --> 00:21.800]  Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen announced that the public will no longer be able to openly
[00:21.800 --> 00:25.600]  carry firearms in the state Senate's chamber's public viewing area.
[00:25.600 --> 00:29.840]  We're not going to treat them any differently than everyone else, he said, to open carry
[00:29.840 --> 00:30.840]  advocates.
[00:30.840 --> 00:35.360]  Owen said that it didn't make sense to allow people to openly carry firearms while banning
[00:35.360 --> 00:37.360]  backpacks, signs and umbrellas.
[00:37.360 --> 00:42.600]  The last eye-checked backpacks and umbrellas were not covered under the United States Constitution.
[00:42.600 --> 00:46.680]  But in response to this, open carry advocates are having a rally tomorrow, the 7th, and
[00:46.680 --> 00:50.920]  we have gun owners prepared for arrest at Washington State Capitol.
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.120]  The Washington State Patrol is expected to arrest anyone entering the viewing chambers
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.720]  openly carrying a firearm, although individuals with a concealed pistol license will be allowed
[01:00.720 --> 01:03.720]  to conceal carry weapons into the chambers.
[01:03.720 --> 01:08.120]  And of course, we know in Washington State, Bloomberg and Bill Gates, if they're pushing
[01:08.120 --> 01:12.360]  our anti-gun agenda, so we'll just have to wait and see how this turns out.
[01:12.360 --> 01:16.720]  And last year, you guys may also recall how Arkansas gun range, declaring itself to be
[01:16.720 --> 01:18.720]  a Muslim-free zone.
[01:18.720 --> 01:22.880]  But now, after the massacre that happened in Pakistan, Pakistani teachers are now being
[01:22.880 --> 01:25.480]  able to carry in the classroom.
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.280]  After 150 children and educators were killed by Taliban terrorists in a brutal massacre
[01:30.280 --> 01:35.040]  in December, the Pakistani government gave permission to teachers to be armed while at
[01:35.040 --> 01:36.040]  work.
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.040]  I'm very happy to see this.
[01:37.040 --> 01:40.080]  Whether it's in Pakistan or here in the States, I think it's much better to arm the
[01:40.080 --> 01:44.080]  teachers than to give the kids Campbell's soup cans and tell them to throw them at their
[01:44.080 --> 01:45.080]  attackers.
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.200]  And we'll end with this, murder victim's sister on gun control group.
[01:49.200 --> 02:19.160]  Don't use her to push your agenda.
[02:19.160 --> 02:20.160]  That's it for now.
[02:20.160 --> 02:34.320]  You can find more reports at infowars.com.
[02:34.320 --> 02:39.280]  There's just one more thing you've got to worry about as the world moves toward RFID
[02:39.280 --> 02:42.440]  everything, digital pickpockets.
[02:42.440 --> 02:47.560]  Here hackers show just how easily your credit card information can be stolen from thin air
[02:47.560 --> 02:48.560]  in seconds.
[02:48.560 --> 02:54.920]  It's a practice known as data skimming that allows criminals to use RFID readers to harvest
[02:54.920 --> 03:00.240]  bank details from cards that use wave and pay radio technology.
[03:00.240 --> 03:06.760]  RFID cards transmit bank details via their own radio signal, so criminals standing just
[03:06.760 --> 03:14.120]  six inches away are able to harvest bank details using RFID readers or even apps that are downloaded
[03:14.120 --> 03:15.720]  to their phones.
[03:15.720 --> 03:22.200]  If a reader or RFID app enabled smartphone is within range, hackers can pick up on that
[03:22.200 --> 03:27.800]  wireless signal as it's transmitted when the card is being used to buy a product.
[03:27.800 --> 03:31.440]  That information can then be used to replicate the card.
[03:31.440 --> 03:35.400]  Now the fact that the readers aren't able to get the three digit security code off the
[03:35.400 --> 03:39.600]  back of your credit card, that can sort of help, but you'll notice that that security
[03:39.600 --> 03:43.000]  code isn't really necessary for most purchases.
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.400]  And the danger here is that it's estimated that nearly 70% of cards will soon be vulnerable
[03:48.400 --> 03:50.360]  to digital pickpocketing.
[03:50.360 --> 03:53.600]  Now there are ways to protect your information right now.
[03:53.600 --> 03:59.760]  You can wrap the card in tin foil or you can also pick up a specially lined wallet like
[03:59.760 --> 04:02.880]  those that we sell at the InfoWars store.
[04:02.880 --> 04:09.520]  Not only are they going to stop RFID identity theft, but also cell phone tracking and eavesdropping.
[04:09.520 --> 04:13.900]  But what's the contingency plan when these RFID chips are going to be embedded under
[04:13.900 --> 04:15.400]  our skin?
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.800]  Google CEO Eric Schmidt is basically foaming at the mouth just talking about this technology
[04:20.800 --> 04:22.440]  becoming intrinsic.
[04:22.440 --> 04:27.480]  We've already reported about a company in Sweden who's requiring its employees to get
[04:27.480 --> 04:34.040]  RFID chips just so they can make photocopies or enter and exit the building.
[04:34.040 --> 04:38.760]  But these embedded RFID implants will contain a lot more information than just your banking
[04:38.760 --> 04:39.760]  data.
[04:39.760 --> 04:44.000]  Of course they'll have your social security number, as well as your private health and
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  criminal history.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.480]  They'll be used to track and monitor all of your movements.
[04:48.480 --> 04:53.320]  So of course this is information that's very vital to not only hackers, but also government
[04:53.320 --> 04:54.320]  agencies.
[04:54.320 --> 04:59.240]  Isn't it kind of ironic to think that in the future we're all probably going to be wearing
[04:59.240 --> 05:00.760]  tin foil hats.
[05:00.760 --> 05:09.200]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges, unlocked the energy
[05:09.200 --> 05:12.640]  it takes to defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality, specifically
[05:12.640 --> 05:18.360]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior
[05:18.360 --> 05:21.680]  vitality in males and females.

[05:31.040 --> 05:34.720]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.080]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:39.080 --> 05:41.080]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:41.080 --> 05:46.680]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[05:46.680 --> 05:48.680]  priced and fully legal.
[05:48.680 --> 05:56.760]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.
[05:56.760 --> 06:00.920]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[06:00.920 --> 06:02.920]  What disaster is so powerful?
[06:02.920 --> 06:08.600]  It unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns and violent food riots, all at the
[06:08.600 --> 06:09.600]  same time.
[06:09.600 --> 06:14.560]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse
[06:14.560 --> 06:17.000]  is less than 13 months away.
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.920]  Our CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S. population could perish.
[06:21.920 --> 06:25.400]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[06:25.400 --> 06:27.800]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[06:27.800 --> 06:29.520]  Mass riots will follow.
[06:29.520 --> 06:31.520]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[06:31.520 --> 06:35.560]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?

[06:41.080 --> 06:46.120]  ones, and even your entire community when this worst-case scenario unravels.

[07:00.920 --> 07:07.040]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits

[07:19.200 --> 07:24.160]  The fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes
[07:24.160 --> 07:26.320]  to you and your family's health.

[08:00.920 --> 08:10.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday the 13th on this live worldwide edition of the transmission.
[08:10.640 --> 08:15.960]  February, Friday the 13th, 2015, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[08:15.960 --> 08:22.240]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and it is time for the people of the world to stand up and
[08:22.240 --> 08:28.040]  let the globalist social engineers know that we are aware of their manipulation and that
[08:28.040 --> 08:30.600]  they are not in control of our minds anymore.
[08:30.600 --> 08:35.920]  That is the beginning of their collapse, the minute we realize that we are free.
[08:35.920 --> 08:52.320]  Prepare yourself for a perfectly outrageous motion picture.
[08:52.320 --> 08:55.640]  I would be a one-up there last night and said what every American feels that he's tired of
[08:55.640 --> 08:56.640]  all the bull.
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.640]  Thanks, Diana.
[08:57.640 --> 09:01.600]  We're talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on national television.
[09:01.600 --> 09:05.520]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[09:05.520 --> 09:09.400]  There is no America.
[09:09.400 --> 09:11.920]  There is no democracy.
[09:11.920 --> 09:23.400]  There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon.
[09:23.400 --> 09:26.520]  Those are the nations of the world today.
[09:26.520 --> 09:39.480]  And you have meddled with the primal forces of nature, and you will atone.
[09:39.480 --> 09:41.840]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Biel?
[09:41.840 --> 09:42.840]  Who am I?
[09:42.840 --> 09:44.840]  Was your own television dummy?
[09:44.840 --> 10:01.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, the network news hour with Power and Biel.
[10:01.120 --> 10:03.360]  I can't do it.
[10:03.360 --> 10:04.360]  We'll do it live.
[10:04.360 --> 10:05.360]  Okay.
[10:05.360 --> 10:06.360]  We'll do it live.
[10:06.360 --> 10:07.360]  Do it live.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.360]  I can do it.
[10:08.360 --> 10:12.960]  I'll write it and we'll do it live.
[10:12.960 --> 10:21.760]  That's tomorrow and that is it for us today.
[10:21.760 --> 10:22.760]  I'm Bill O'Reilly.
[10:22.760 --> 10:23.760]  Thanks again for watching.
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.800]  We'll leave you with Sting and a cut off his new album.
[10:26.800 --> 10:27.800]  Take it away.
[10:27.800 --> 10:29.300]  Congressman, let me interrupt you just for a moment.
[10:29.300 --> 10:31.400]  We've got some breaking news out of Miami.
[10:31.400 --> 10:37.200]  Stand by a female right now in Miami, Justin Bieber has been arrested on a number of charges.
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.920]  The judge is reading the charges, including resisting arrest and driving under the influence
[10:42.920 --> 10:47.240]  he's appearing now before the judge for his bond hearing.
[10:47.240 --> 10:52.440]  I want a show developed based on the activities of a terrorist group.
[10:52.440 --> 10:57.160]  Well, I made that one make a TV star out of you.
[10:57.160 --> 10:58.920]  You're going to be a household word.
[10:58.920 --> 11:01.720]  Osama bin Laden is just one person.
[11:01.720 --> 11:09.720]  He is representative of networks of people who absolutely have made their cause to defeat
[11:09.720 --> 11:12.680]  the freedoms that we understand.
[11:12.680 --> 11:14.560]  And we will not allow him to do so.
[11:14.560 --> 11:18.840]  Beth of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort
[11:18.840 --> 11:20.080]  to defeat Al Qaeda.
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.520]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a U.S. helicopter.
[11:24.520 --> 11:28.000]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.960]  are U.S. Navy SEALs.
[11:29.960 --> 11:36.240]  It is the international system of currency which determines the totality of life on this
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.240]  planet.
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.680]  NATO is in command of the entire U.S. military publicly.
[11:41.680 --> 11:45.240]  Some land security now says their mission has nothing to do with Al Qaeda or Muslim
[11:45.240 --> 11:50.560]  extremists and has to do with the Tea Party who will launch police killing terror attacks
[11:50.560 --> 11:51.920]  any minute.
[11:51.920 --> 11:55.000]  With no evidence of that, now it's beginning.
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.040]  The borders are completely wide open, tens of millions of people are flooding here as
[12:00.040 --> 12:05.080]  we speak, hundreds of thousands a month, pouring over the borders, being given driver's license
[12:05.080 --> 12:08.040]  in California to pull the lever to ban guns.
[12:08.040 --> 12:12.880]  We are in the middle of a globalist revolution against this country right now.
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.720]  I don't have to tell you things are bad, everybody knows things are bad.
[12:16.720 --> 12:22.880]  It's a depression, everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
[12:22.880 --> 12:27.440]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun out of
[12:27.440 --> 12:31.200]  the counter, punks are running wild in the street, there's nobody anywhere who seems
[12:31.200 --> 12:33.040]  to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.720]  We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, we sit watching our
[12:38.720 --> 12:44.080]  TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent
[12:44.080 --> 12:46.640]  crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be.
[12:46.640 --> 12:51.240]  We know things are bad, worse than bad, they're crazy, it's like everything everywhere is
[12:51.240 --> 12:53.640]  going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
[12:53.640 --> 12:57.360]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say
[12:57.360 --> 13:02.640]  is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms, let me have my toaster and my TV and
[13:02.640 --> 13:05.920]  my steel built in radios and I won't say anything, just leave us alone.
[13:05.920 --> 13:12.000]  Well I'm not going to leave you alone, I want you to get mad.
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.280]  Network, television will never be the same.
[13:15.280 --> 13:26.640]  Good, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
[13:26.640 --> 13:27.640]  go, go, go, go.
[13:27.640 --> 13:36.000]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.280]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition, who are they going to fight a
[13:42.280 --> 13:43.280]  war against?
[13:43.280 --> 13:47.720]  And just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[13:47.720 --> 13:53.200]  Multiple sources tell CNN as many as 40 veterans died while they were waiting for medical care
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.200]  at this VA facility.
[13:54.200 --> 14:00.600]  Alex Jones may sound crazy, but still has 300 million YouTube, well yes, 3 million people
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.400]  that have watched him on YouTube, and then sort of fringe, arch-conservative, deeply
[14:05.400 --> 14:08.320]  I think racist, strange.
[14:08.320 --> 14:12.520]  Challenge Alex Jones through a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got
[14:12.520 --> 14:14.840]  legally and pop on the court just in case.
[14:14.840 --> 14:15.840]  I'd love to see that.
[14:15.840 --> 14:16.840]  In uniform.
[14:16.840 --> 14:22.840]  Hey listen, I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up, this isn't a game.
[14:22.840 --> 14:30.340]  I want you to get up now, I want all of you to get up out of your chairs, I want you to
[14:30.340 --> 14:37.080]  get up right now, and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I am
[14:37.080 --> 14:43.160]  as mad as hell, and I am not going to take this anymore, I want you to get up right now.
[14:43.160 --> 14:46.600]  Stick your head out of the window opening and stick your head out and keep yelling and
[14:46.600 --> 14:52.700]  yell, I'm as mad as hell, I'm not going to take this anymore, just get up out of your
[14:52.700 --> 14:54.260]  Right now. What are you doing?
[14:54.340 --> 14:56.100]  I want to see if anybody's yelling.
[14:56.180 --> 15:00.540]  Open it and stick your head out and yell and keep yelling, hey!
[15:00.620 --> 15:05.660]  I'm mad as hell! How am I gonna take this anyway?
[15:05.740 --> 15:10.420]  I'm mad as hell! I'm not gonna take it anymore!
[15:10.500 --> 15:13.300]  I'm mad as hell! I'm not going to take it anymore!
[15:13.380 --> 15:15.980]  I'm mad as hell! I'm not going to take it anymore!
[15:16.060 --> 15:19.580]  I'm mad as hell! I'm not gonna take it anymore!
[15:19.580 --> 15:32.300]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[15:32.300 --> 15:42.820]  the Info War.
[15:42.820 --> 15:48.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, the 13th transmission, Dr.
[15:48.580 --> 15:53.580]  Andrew Wakefield will be joining us.
[15:53.580 --> 16:00.540]  He is the medical doctor from England who now lives in Austin, Texas, who is suing the
[16:00.540 --> 16:05.460]  journalist author of the so-called medical report debunking his study.
[16:05.460 --> 16:12.260]  They used that hoax report to then put out another larger hoax that the only piece of
[16:12.260 --> 16:18.100]  evidence showing vaccines was dangerous had been overturned and fraudulently created.
[16:18.100 --> 16:27.620]  Just last week, the court in England returned the medical degree and good standing to his
[16:27.620 --> 16:35.660]  co-author and he is set very soon to have hearings and is set to be exonerated as well.
[16:35.660 --> 16:38.020]  So just remember that.
[16:38.020 --> 16:41.420]  British Court throws out conviction of autism vaccine MD.
[16:41.420 --> 16:46.140]  Andrew Wakefield's co-author completely exonerated.
[16:46.140 --> 16:51.540]  That's from the autism action network it links through to the British reports.
[16:51.540 --> 16:55.420]  They do not want you knowing this because there are a bunch of liars just like Brian
[16:55.420 --> 16:56.420]  Williams.
[16:56.420 --> 17:03.700]  By the way, Brian Williams is in more trouble now for saying that he was most honored to
[17:03.700 --> 17:07.660]  report on the fall of the Berlin Wall and to see it fall.
[17:07.660 --> 17:10.940]  And it turns out he didn't get there until a day after.
[17:10.940 --> 17:13.380]  The Berlin Wall was falling for weeks.
[17:13.380 --> 17:14.740]  I'm not defending Brian Williams.
[17:14.740 --> 17:19.660]  He's a horrible anti-gun globalist teleprompter reading liar.
[17:19.660 --> 17:27.860]  But saying I was there when the Berlin Wall fell, I mean he was there when the Berlin Wall
[17:27.860 --> 17:28.860]  fell.
[17:28.860 --> 17:34.740]  If you're there when it's falling down the next day being taken down, that was ongoing
[17:34.740 --> 17:35.740]  for weeks.
[17:35.740 --> 17:40.300]  Then yes, maybe a fish story, maybe you caught a 10 pound fish, you said it was a 15 pound
[17:40.300 --> 17:41.300]  fish.
[17:41.300 --> 17:42.300]  Whatever.
[17:42.300 --> 17:46.940]  Lying and saying there are no death panels in Obamacare.
[17:46.940 --> 17:48.580]  Lying and saying you can keep your doctor.
[17:48.580 --> 17:50.620]  Lying and saying they wouldn't come after our guns.
[17:50.620 --> 17:56.140]  Lying and saying there's no amnesty in the new amnesty legislation.
[17:56.140 --> 17:59.020]  That's the type of stuff that people should be really angry about.
[17:59.020 --> 18:02.540]  But hey, if it discredits dinosaur media that's always trying to attack any type of independent
[18:02.540 --> 18:04.820]  media, great, great.
[18:04.820 --> 18:08.460]  Of course the guy is a congenital liar.
[18:08.460 --> 18:11.860]  He wasn't there with dead bodies floating past at his hotel in Katrina.
[18:11.860 --> 18:16.540]  He wasn't in the helicopter shot down, he wasn't near it, on and on and on.
[18:16.540 --> 18:22.340]  And yes, he wasn't there at the Brandenburg Gate right when the first pieces fell.
[18:22.340 --> 18:24.660]  So I guess he's a liar on that count as well.
[18:24.660 --> 18:32.700]  But it doesn't matter in the aggregate compared to the big lies of the private run-for-profit
[18:32.700 --> 18:37.500]  Federal Reserve that tells Congress it's above the law.
[18:37.500 --> 18:41.180]  And all these Republican and Democratic senators coming out saying don't meddle in it, you
[18:41.180 --> 18:42.180]  know, stop Rand Paul.
[18:42.180 --> 18:45.020]  Let me tell you, Rand Paul is a hero.
[18:45.020 --> 18:49.060]  He's not perfect, but compared to the globalist, he is an angel.
[18:49.060 --> 18:55.940]  I mean he's barely defeated the gun grabbing bills with Ted Cruz, barely defeated a whole
[18:55.940 --> 19:00.900]  bunch of garbage and now he's in there trying to get the audit the Fed bill passed.
[19:00.900 --> 19:06.660]  I just see such vitriol by the trolls criticizing Rand Paul online and that's because it's paid
[19:06.660 --> 19:10.180]  for to get the ball rolling and then other people join in on it.
[19:10.180 --> 19:16.700]  Let's say snowball effect, they try to create a megaphone effect, an amplification effect
[19:16.700 --> 19:21.740]  and I just bring that up as a side issue because it's just, he's exposing our government
[19:21.740 --> 19:25.180]  funded al-Qaeda and ISIS right now that Hillary's involved.
[19:25.180 --> 19:26.180]  Nobody else is doing that.
[19:26.180 --> 19:28.900]  In fact, Rand Paul is even better than Ted Cruz.
[19:28.900 --> 19:30.860]  Ted Cruz's wife, I know, worked for Goldman Sachs.
[19:30.860 --> 19:35.060]  So does anybody else basically that is successful in banking and she resigned from the council
[19:35.060 --> 19:36.060]  on farm relations.
[19:36.060 --> 19:37.780]  I don't care what organization they were in.
[19:37.780 --> 19:40.260]  I care about their voting records.
[19:40.260 --> 19:43.620]  I mean, Saul of Tarsus was the biggest persecutor of Christians.
[19:43.620 --> 19:47.100]  He became the greatest leader of Christians after Christ.
[19:47.100 --> 19:48.100]  So I don't care.
[19:48.100 --> 19:53.220]  I mean as long as Darth Vader throws the emperor down the mine shaft as an allegory, I don't
[19:53.220 --> 19:57.020]  care if he was Darth Vader five minutes before because now he's going back to be an Anakin
[19:57.020 --> 19:58.020]  Skywalker.
[19:58.020 --> 20:00.740]  We've got to give everybody that chance, stay with us.

[21:00.140 --> 21:02.060]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[21:02.060 --> 21:07.020]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors.
[21:07.020 --> 21:11.740]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors then you're making
[21:11.740 --> 21:13.060]  it easy for them.
[21:13.060 --> 21:17.740]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness.
[21:17.740 --> 21:18.740]  The phone line.
[21:18.740 --> 21:24.140]  You shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long term contract and think you're safe.
[21:24.140 --> 21:28.900]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip and when a burglar cuts your
[21:28.900 --> 21:31.380]  phone line, you're defenseless.

[24:35.300 --> 24:41.660]  in the head and now the president of Argentina Fernandez has been charged in
[24:41.660 --> 24:47.020]  probe of alleged cover-up while a conspiracy that they might actually
[24:47.020 --> 24:51.860]  kill an investigator from the government who had proof that she was
[24:51.860 --> 24:59.780]  connected to communist bombings decades before and other activities like Obama
[24:59.780 --> 25:04.220]  and his connection to the weathermen who come on this show and say they're not
[25:04.220 --> 25:08.980]  communist and that they don't want violence I mean a load of horse crap
[25:08.980 --> 25:13.220]  and I'm sorry to talk like that but that is what it is a rose is still a rose by
[25:13.220 --> 25:18.780]  any other name and bologna is still Bravo Sierra by any other name stocks have

[25:58.820 --> 26:03.700]  training Iraqi troops after Obama submits war authorization that's a
[26:03.700 --> 26:10.620]  Kurt Nemo report our war correspondent Joe Biggs has contacts in the army and
[26:10.620 --> 26:16.380]  the Marines and he is on the phone right now with them confirming what AP and
[26:16.380 --> 26:22.260]  Reuters and others are reporting that 300 Marines may be trapped right as
[26:22.260 --> 26:28.260]  Obama tries to get his war authorization notice how ISIS hits perfectly right
[26:28.260 --> 26:33.940]  when Obama needs them to to get this blanket war authorization which will
[26:33.940 --> 26:38.780]  be used on Syria al Qaeda's enemy they've already said we want to carve an
[26:38.780 --> 26:43.020]  area remove these groups and put good Syrian rebels in to take over Syria and
[26:43.020 --> 26:48.060]  that's all this is is a U.S. force sent there to mop up some of the disparate
[26:48.060 --> 26:52.100]  ISIS groups because there's always in fighting that aren't following orders
[26:52.100 --> 26:58.700]  exactly correctly of NATO and others and then they'll mop up some of those guys
[26:58.700 --> 27:01.940]  for television you have some images of them being flown around on C-130s a
[27:01.940 --> 27:06.740]  torture basis they'll be trained on how to be better operatives and released in
[27:06.740 --> 27:11.100]  5-10 years to start the next war that's what camp x-ray is I said it a decade
[27:11.100 --> 27:17.780]  ago camp x-ray at Gitmo is an al Qaeda training command base we knew I mean it

[27:28.500 --> 27:34.580]  them test new mind control drugs test new mind control chips I mean this this
[27:34.580 --> 27:39.180]  came out in the news that it was super buck Rogers high-tech stuff right down
[27:39.180 --> 27:48.780]  to PCP LSD and flying in top hookers to it was really cuz I just wanted to have

[28:28.460 --> 28:31.500]  that will then serve you and follow orders and that's why almost every
[28:31.500 --> 28:37.460]  commander in ISIS right now is a Gitmo graduate you know some people go to
[28:37.460 --> 28:40.940]  Harvard or go to University of Texas you go to Cambridge no no they go to Gitmo

[33:48.500 --> 33:53.940]  well my goodness traces let me tell you the news my head's been wet with the
[33:53.940 --> 34:01.140]  midnight duty I've been down on bended knee talking to the man from Cali he
[34:01.140 --> 34:06.540]  spoke to me as a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels where
[34:06.540 --> 34:12.780]  to begin all my name and my heart stood still when he said John go do my will go
[34:12.780 --> 34:16.380]  tell that we're start I mean the news is all just over the top and all of it
[34:16.380 --> 34:21.420]  illustrates really important things let's just begin where we just ended the
[34:21.420 --> 34:25.940]  last segment ISIS on the doorstep fighters reportedly sees Iraqi town
[34:25.940 --> 34:31.900]  near base holding US Marines Fox News Gateway Pundit ISIS seizes Iraq City
[34:31.900 --> 34:37.220]  attacks Al Assad base with 300 Marines inside eight suicide bombers killed
[34:37.220 --> 34:43.420]  inside base I mean this is just all al-Qaeda attack I look at the photos
[34:43.420 --> 34:47.060]  here they're all waving al-Qaeda flags and our media keeps acting like ISIS is
[34:47.060 --> 34:52.260]  different than the Syrian free army in al-Qaeda I mean it's just a total job if
[34:52.260 --> 34:56.060]  it wasn't so serious and again it's a real war they'll kill Marines they'll kill
[34:56.060 --> 35:05.420]  army soldiers they'll kill sailors so it's a real war that people like Chris
[35:05.420 --> 35:08.620]  call over there fighting but at the end of the day the globalist are behind the
[35:08.620 --> 35:16.540]  whole thing orchestrating it we're gonna continue to investigate this curtain
[35:16.540 --> 35:20.740]  has a boil down of it with video at info wars calm ISIS captured city where
[35:20.740 --> 35:26.700]  Marines are training Iraqi troops after Obama submits war authorization Al
[35:26.700 --> 35:34.220]  Baghdadi is the town what is that like the Baghdad the little Baghdad taken by
[35:34.220 --> 35:40.860]  ISIS and then look at this article this is so incredible I'm watching this at
[35:40.860 --> 35:44.900]  the time just as a neutral person knowing George Soros was behind and
[35:44.900 --> 35:48.220]  bragged about it the five billion dollars state Department to overthrow
[35:48.220 --> 35:52.260]  Ukraine put in a unelected government they call that a dictatorship
[35:52.260 --> 35:59.900]  and I remember seeing clearly in the videos that were even being put out on
[35:59.900 --> 36:08.460]  their state-run TV that it was snipers from the west and in pro-western
[36:08.460 --> 36:13.700]  Ukraine shooting at the elected government police and killing them so the
[36:13.700 --> 36:16.620]  police would then shoot back and they could say that was a police massacre
[36:16.620 --> 36:21.500]  well now RT reports and I don't just believe RT they have a link to BBC
[36:21.500 --> 36:25.580]  interviewing one of the leaders admitting that they were there sniping
[36:25.580 --> 36:32.300]  the police and started it so they're just so arrogant BBC airs fighter
[36:32.300 --> 36:36.940]  admitting he fired on police before Kiev massacre the BBC is there at footage
[36:36.940 --> 36:42.420]  of an opposition fighter who says he fired at police I'm watching the
[36:42.420 --> 36:45.740]  footage I mean the media was saying that they were protesters shooting at the
[36:45.740 --> 36:52.860]  police it wasn't wasn't denied okay that's just some of the news on that
[36:52.860 --> 36:57.980]  front let me get into the really serious news here that's coming up I'm gonna
[36:57.980 --> 37:02.260]  cover this in the third hour so it'll take some time North Carolina killer a
[37:02.260 --> 37:06.820]  fan of the Southern Poverty Law Center I noticed the Tea Party and people that
[37:06.820 --> 37:15.180]  don't want totally open borders the last few days were being blamed for these
[37:15.180 --> 37:21.900]  three Muslims that were shot in Florida and then I noticed it went off the news
[37:21.900 --> 37:25.420]  and I thought what's going on well the crew pointed out to me and the weekly
[37:25.420 --> 37:31.260]  standard has it and a bunch of other publications world that daily has it and
[37:31.260 --> 37:35.060]  Joseph Harris is why aren't you hearing about
[37:38.780 --> 37:41.940]  why aren't you hearing about this it was in Chapel Hill North Carolina well
[37:41.940 --> 37:45.380]  we're not hearing about it was another event in Florida because Craig Hicks the
[37:45.380 --> 37:48.900]  suspect charged the murders as an atheist in a family Southern Poverty Law
[37:48.900 --> 37:54.860]  Center and likes MSNBC host Rachel Maddow the science guy Bill Nye same-sex
[37:54.860 --> 37:59.380]  marriage groups and the Freedom from Religion Foundation so he's immune
[37:59.380 --> 38:04.340]  because he's liberal three Muslim students murdered near University of
[38:04.340 --> 38:08.660]  North Carolina corporate media accused of glossing over story that's a Don's
[38:08.660 --> 38:13.780]  report about the World Med Daily report and they had another case that we'll
[38:13.780 --> 38:16.420]  talk about remember the guy that went in and shot up the family research
[38:16.420 --> 38:22.060]  council and he said he did it for the Southern Poverty Law Center this is a
[38:22.060 --> 38:30.220]  group that within an hour or less of Richard Poplowski in Pittsburgh
[38:30.220 --> 38:38.300]  Pennsylvania six years ago shooting and killing three police officers they were
[38:38.300 --> 38:41.780]  blaming me saying he did it for me
[38:45.140 --> 38:49.820]  we're gonna play the Corkins video when he's you know talking to the FBI
[38:49.820 --> 38:53.140]  agents admitting that he did it because of what he learned from the Southern
[38:53.140 --> 38:57.500]  Poverty Law Center when he shot up the family research council but the reason
[38:57.500 --> 39:06.740]  I'm getting back into this is within an hour they had it on the Pittsburgh front
[39:06.740 --> 39:12.020]  page newspaper they were announcing it on national news and imagine he's
[39:12.020 --> 39:15.780]  barely at the police station and I'm being blamed they're running into his
[39:15.780 --> 39:20.940]  computer claiming oh he visited info wars.com well we just went to his social
[39:20.940 --> 39:24.820]  media websites and found him saying that I work for Israel and then I need to be
[39:24.820 --> 39:28.620]  taken out and then he's gonna dedicate his life to stopping me he was on the
[39:28.620 --> 39:32.900]  storm front website everywhere else but the Southern Poverty Law Center and the
[39:32.900 --> 39:38.620]  ADL within an hour had their people inside the police department leaking it
[39:38.620 --> 39:43.140]  trying to connect it to me again folks they're after us is what I'm saying and
[39:43.140 --> 39:46.780]  they're after anybody that doesn't want to just sell the country completely down
[39:46.780 --> 39:50.580]  the river to corruption and that's happened a bunch where they get on the
[39:50.580 --> 39:55.340]  news they say Alex Jones once cops did this is a meme they put out because they
[39:55.340 --> 39:59.500]  know I'm saying we don't want civil war we don't want to protest here any
[39:59.500 --> 40:03.460]  violently when we don't want to go out if it ever goes to violence and randomly
[40:03.460 --> 40:08.900]  shoot cops or military that will drive the police and military into the arms
[40:08.900 --> 40:12.940]  of the globalist plus it doesn't hurt the globalist they hate the police in
[40:12.940 --> 40:16.420]  the military look at their internal training they're totally worried about
[40:16.420 --> 40:19.780]  the military and police they're worried about anybody that's got force and that
[40:19.780 --> 40:24.820]  is in the inside tyranny's always keep police and military on a very short
[40:24.820 --> 40:31.180]  abusive tyrannical leash so natural allies of the police and military it's
[40:31.180 --> 40:34.180]  like if you go to a party and you act like you don't like anybody you sit in
[40:34.180 --> 40:42.460]  the corner mad and you think everybody hates you what's the doors line about
[40:42.460 --> 40:51.820]  women seem wicked when you're unwanted it's all how we reach out to people and
[40:51.820 --> 40:56.580]  and and they want us all isolated and they want to divide and conquer scenario
[40:56.580 --> 41:03.780]  in this country and I know I said all the time because it's so simple but you go
[41:03.780 --> 41:07.260]  to a party and you're out going telling jokes having a great time everybody's
[41:07.260 --> 41:11.980]  gonna be over there talking to you people are strange when you're a stranger
[41:11.980 --> 41:16.260]  faces look ugly when you're alone women seem wicked when you're unwanted streets
[41:16.260 --> 41:22.220]  are uneven when you're down when you're strange faces come out of the rain when
[41:22.220 --> 41:26.060]  you're strange no one remembers your name when you're strange when you're
[41:26.060 --> 41:30.420]  strange when you're strange and see that's why they 30 years ago infiltrated
[41:30.420 --> 41:37.940]  the proto modern militia movement that's totally constitutional absolutely part
[41:37.940 --> 41:42.180]  of our system and wonderful with feds and globalists to make everybody hide in
[41:42.180 --> 41:46.900]  the woods think the cops are coming to kill them freaking out so they could
[41:46.900 --> 41:50.260]  project an image of a bunch of crazies hiding out in the bushes to then put
[41:50.260 --> 41:54.740]  that in movies and TV shows to then create the perception that anyone owning
[41:54.740 --> 41:59.220]  guns wants to kill all the police so the police would then start alerting on
[41:59.220 --> 42:04.140]  them like a hunting dog that's been trained to go after rabbits well if you
[42:04.140 --> 42:07.260]  look like a rabbit the dogs trying to take down rabbits come after you it's
[42:07.260 --> 42:10.820]  like MTV in the whole culture teaches the kids how to wear their pants hanging
[42:10.820 --> 42:15.900]  down around their legs prison style prison punk style and wear certain
[42:15.900 --> 42:20.580]  outfits and things on record while they train the police to alert on it that
[42:20.580 --> 42:27.900]  that's guns drugs illegal activity you're putting on a uniform an enemy
[42:27.900 --> 42:31.860]  uniform and then squaring off against people that have been trained to attack
[42:31.860 --> 42:37.100]  you and everyone just follows the roles through the hype like idiots the police
[42:37.100 --> 42:40.340]  go along with it the gangbangers go along with we're all being played like
[42:40.340 --> 42:46.300]  little chump morons so we're gonna be getting to that and playing some of
[42:46.300 --> 42:50.340]  those clips coming up yeah just a few minutes in 30 hour but I want to get
[42:50.340 --> 42:54.220]  all that lined up and document that for folks that the real promoters of hate
[42:54.220 --> 42:59.020]  are people like the Southern Primary Law Center and ADL and they continue to get
[42:59.020 --> 43:03.460]  caught with their parents down and that's a good thing but since I mentioned
[43:03.460 --> 43:12.820]  media manipulation and media control I thought that I would play this piece and
[43:12.820 --> 43:19.060]  and this isn't a auxiliary info wars dot com reporter that put this report out
[43:19.060 --> 43:22.340]  and then Paul Watson wrote a story around it and I've said many times don't
[43:22.340 --> 43:26.500]  ask me permission to be an info wars reporter don't ask me permission to
[43:26.500 --> 43:29.380]  paint info wars dot com on the side of your barn you have absolute right to do
[43:29.380 --> 43:34.820]  that you're a fan of Coca-Cola you can paint on the side of your barn but we
[43:34.820 --> 43:37.300]  get these emails and calls almost every day you know can I put your stuff on
[43:37.300 --> 43:42.620]  access television can I write about you you know in an article for the school
[43:42.620 --> 43:46.660]  paper can we can we write about info wars in a play I'm writing for drama
[43:46.660 --> 43:52.940]  you can write about Moby Dick if you want or or Elvis Presley or Jesus Christ
[43:52.940 --> 43:58.140]  I mean whatever you want freedom is your freedom to create culture and art
[43:58.140 --> 44:02.100]  without getting permission and that's what political correctness is is I
[44:02.100 --> 44:07.380]  better not say or do anything that's why they keep widening it to brown bags and
[44:07.380 --> 44:11.460]  dodgeball and everything's politically incorrect show that you're just scared to
[44:11.460 --> 44:16.380]  death and just go in a ball and only repeat what you saw in Family Guy and
[44:16.380 --> 44:20.740]  as the mainstream media is discredited they're gonna segue to comedy central
[44:20.740 --> 44:25.140]  and movies and drama that's where the real propaganda is and I almost don't
[44:25.140 --> 44:28.260]  even want to go to this piece because I'd like to get a piece Darren McBrain
[44:28.260 --> 44:34.020]  did maybe we can do this on the nightly news and then air it on the Sunday show
[44:34.020 --> 44:38.100]  and post some info wars for people he did a whole report on admitted
[44:38.100 --> 44:43.980]  subliminals in TV ads in the modern age and it's like a sharpie ad where they
[44:43.980 --> 44:47.380]  just flash it for two seconds and it shows protesters and it says don't
[44:47.380 --> 44:54.540]  protest submit and that is subliminal and then we've got cases where in breaking
[44:54.540 --> 44:58.260]  bad over and over again they would attack Ron Paul in just flashes where
[44:58.260 --> 45:03.900]  drug dealers and child molesters liked Ron Paul and they only do it for a few
[45:03.900 --> 45:08.940]  seconds because your subconscious brain reads it sees it makes the connection
[45:08.940 --> 45:13.260]  your subconscious mind could be some estimates are a hundred times some are
[45:13.260 --> 45:18.260]  only ten times more powerful than your cerebral cortex the frontal lobes the
[45:18.260 --> 45:24.060]  left and right hemispheres the brain are tiny compared to the rest of your
[45:24.060 --> 45:29.420]  brain and they have to focus all this incredible knowledge down to what you're
[45:29.420 --> 45:37.260]  currently thinking about what you're currently dealing with and so folks are
[45:37.260 --> 45:40.740]  pointing this out we're seeing this more and more where they create a mock
[45:40.740 --> 45:45.220]  info wars comm website and then have it with a ridiculous conspiracy theory and
[45:45.220 --> 45:49.660]  this is done at a subliminal level because you cannot read it when they
[45:49.660 --> 45:56.500]  flash it up there for one second but your subconscious mind did and we're
[45:56.500 --> 46:01.100]  seeing this all over the place so I hate to just show one example because I
[46:01.100 --> 46:08.180]  mean let me tell you what's subliminal quasi-subliminal Bill O'Reilly did the
[46:08.180 --> 46:11.660]  report a few years ago and he's done this several times about cyber stalking
[46:11.660 --> 46:16.460]  and men trying to rape women over the internet via Craigslist and then he
[46:16.460 --> 46:20.700]  cuts to me screaming in that case about police or something nothing about women
[46:20.700 --> 46:24.140]  and my face turning red and he says these haters must be stopped I mean I
[46:24.140 --> 46:28.860]  showed my lawyer he said yeah you can soon who's core and when do you want to
[46:28.860 --> 46:31.260]  spend a million dollars and take a couple years to get to his or million
[46:31.260 --> 46:36.220]  dollars and they were racial mad at all I mean my lawyers rated probably the top
[46:36.220 --> 46:39.660]  lawyer in Texas and I'm not bragging he and he said but I mean do you want to
[46:39.660 --> 46:45.700]  waste your time and I said no they're just so discredited but there's a
[46:45.700 --> 46:49.660]  headline Bill O'Reilly smears Alex Jones in hate speech rant this is quasi
[46:49.660 --> 46:56.940]  subliminal because it's like they're trying to make me a meme of you know
[46:56.940 --> 47:03.060]  rapist racist because they know I've got their number now let's go to this
[47:03.060 --> 47:07.780]  report comedy central show chides info wars with clone websites segment
[47:07.780 --> 47:12.620]  features main character browsing conspiracy wars which is the same logo as
[47:12.620 --> 47:17.100]  ours with crazy headline you can see the video up on info wars.com of your
[47:17.100 --> 47:21.340]  radio listener here's the audio the mainstream media's propaganda campaign
[47:21.340 --> 47:26.060]  to marginalize Alex Jones and info wars continues to be deployed in full force
[47:26.060 --> 47:30.460]  and on all fronts but the latest attack did not come from the usual suspects
[47:30.460 --> 47:35.660]  MSNBC media matters salon.com or Fox News apparently the mainstream media
[47:35.660 --> 47:39.100]  believes it's just not enough to demonize and lie about info wars in the
[47:39.100 --> 47:43.420]  news alone the attacks must also cross over into entertainment where the
[47:43.420 --> 47:46.900]  audience lets their guard down and are more susceptible to the conditioning a
[47:46.900 --> 47:52.620]  recent episode of comedy central show broad city aired February 11th 2015
[47:52.620 --> 47:57.900]  featured an unfavorable cameo of the info wars website the episode begins with
[47:57.900 --> 48:10.420]  a quick shot of the main characters computer here it is it's only two
[48:10.420 --> 48:19.460]  seconds and it goes by very fast here it is again it was quick but it says
[48:19.460 --> 48:23.380]  Michael Jackson lives in Richard Branson space condo the header on the
[48:23.380 --> 48:28.180]  fictitious website says conspiracy wars which is clearly an exact replica of
[48:28.180 --> 48:32.700]  info wars' website this is more than just a harmless meaningless joke it is a
[48:32.700 --> 48:37.180]  carefully placed subconscious mind conditioning technique the producers of
[48:37.180 --> 48:40.460]  the show went out of their way to create a fake website to condition their
[48:40.460 --> 48:44.620]  audience they associate an outrageous headline with the image of info wars is
[48:44.620 --> 48:48.580]  trademark website header which then gives their viewers a subliminal input
[48:48.580 --> 48:53.260]  that info wars is an unbelievable and untrustworthy news source this quick
[48:53.260 --> 48:57.260]  subliminal message may be enough to dissuade someone from reading an info
[48:57.260 --> 49:01.540]  wars article they may come across without them even knowing why this isn't
[49:01.540 --> 49:04.820]  the first time Alex Jones has been demonized through subliminals in
[49:04.820 --> 49:09.300]  entertainment in 2013 a movie called prisoners came out starring Hugh
[49:09.300 --> 49:12.940]  Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal the antagonist in the movie was a child
[49:12.940 --> 49:18.300]  abductor rapist conveniently named Alex Jones some people may object and say
[49:18.300 --> 49:22.100]  these are no big deal or they're just coincidences but when you consider the
[49:22.100 --> 49:26.500]  mainstream media's repeated dishonest attacks on info wars the war on Alex
[49:26.500 --> 49:31.820]  Jones becomes overtly clear I'm Adam Green reporting unofficially for info
[49:31.820 --> 49:37.060]  wars.com make sure to subscribe below to no more news and catch the sneak
[49:37.060 --> 49:42.740]  preview to my upcoming documentary film the conspiracy theory conspiracy people

[49:48.580 --> 49:52.420]  this is how we end up getting reporters David Knight all these jacarys
[49:52.420 --> 49:56.020]  action they won contest well David Knight didn't win the contest jacarys did
[49:56.020 --> 49:59.660]  but he got in the running even though he lost the contest he ended up moved
[49:59.660 --> 50:02.620]  under from North Carolina was family doing a great job we're just looking for
[50:02.620 --> 50:07.980]  a few good men and women that want to fight tyranny and there are so many
[50:07.980 --> 50:13.780]  examples of this and I made some phone calls to Hollywood and did indeed find
[50:13.780 --> 50:18.260]  out that the Alex Jones name with the writers was kind of a hat tip and they
[50:18.260 --> 50:21.300]  said look the guy ends up being innocent in the movie and it's actually like a
[50:21.300 --> 50:27.060]  good guy so you know it's not all just attacks people like wow the the the
[50:27.060 --> 50:31.780]  child molesters named Alex Jones well it turns out he's not so some of it I
[50:31.780 --> 50:36.100]  mean I mean quite frankly he goes to something like Captain America I mean
[50:36.100 --> 50:39.940]  it's almost like I co-wrote the thing if you listen to this show when we talked
[50:39.940 --> 50:43.340]  about the master plan with the extermination lasers on the blimps and
[50:43.340 --> 50:47.060]  the facecans and that's basically in the movie and everything else and how
[50:47.060 --> 50:51.500]  there's a how Hydra see it's not that they're even copying me it's that I
[50:51.500 --> 50:55.940]  understand how the system works because the globalists have written books about
[50:55.940 --> 51:01.500]  how it works that only they seem to read but are hidden in plain view you hear
[51:01.500 --> 51:05.380]  about it every day another shooting where innocent people lose their lives

[54:22.620 --> 54:27.420]  studies found the same thing just were not widely circulated and the inserts

[54:32.180 --> 54:38.660]  list goes on and on so this is how they done the public down they'll say it's
[54:38.660 --> 54:44.700]  been discredited the wheel does not exist this guy's a fraud it is hoax hoax hoax
[54:44.700 --> 54:50.340]  from the same folks that bring you the fraud that is Brian Williams and I don't
[54:50.340 --> 54:53.640]  like sitting up here talking about myself all day but when I try to destroy
[54:53.640 --> 54:58.100]  Dr. Wakefield they try to destroy Ron Paul or other really good people who we
[54:58.100 --> 55:01.140]  know are legitimate and who they're going after we have to stand up for them
[55:01.140 --> 55:05.860]  and when they're demonizing info wars calm and yours truly we're gonna talk
[55:05.860 --> 55:10.940]  about it because we're getting attacked because we're on target that's it's the

[55:14.220 --> 55:18.420]  much we've got to cover it to further discredit the system and to show people
[55:18.420 --> 55:23.300]  why they're attacking us because we know what these dirty rats are up to and
[55:23.300 --> 55:27.540]  they could all go the way of Brian Williams this system is trying to bring
[55:27.540 --> 55:31.860]  in tyranny because it's tottering well I don't want tyranny to collapse into
[55:31.860 --> 55:36.220]  greater tyranny I wanted to just be phased out into liberty nothing's gonna

[55:46.260 --> 55:50.580]  are almost never successful that's why they try to brand revolution in media

[55:56.500 --> 56:01.340]  organic foods a revolution peaceful things and they're demonizing right now

[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:33.060]  who said truth is stranger than fiction let's look up that quote I think it's
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:38.260]  so old I don't think it's attributed last time I tried to check McDonald's
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:45.060]  gives free vaccines with happy meals info wars dot com and Anthony Guciardi
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:52.540]  lynched directly into the McDonald's promotion page at the Amarillo newspaper
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:01:02.980]  I mean this is just completely insane that they're offering free vaccines and
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.820]  of course they don't give you the insert though that oh this might give you
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:08.500]  pancreatitis oh this might give you Guillain-Barre all this might give you
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.100]  epilepsy this might kill you they just go safe and effective conspiracy
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:23.620]  theorists are lying scum anybody could get the insert and read it for yourself
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:29.420]  like we did last week obnoxiously for an hour I sat there and read a page and a
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:37.420]  half in fine print of the adverse reactions hey want to get
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.900]  type 1 diabetes they'll they'll tell you it's genetic I'm no medical doctor but
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.260]  I've talked to medical doctors at major hospitals here in Austin they go Alex
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:51.620]  you're absolutely right what you say you've you read the literature on and
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:57.100]  my dad told me this years ago and he's an oral surgeon but he's done research
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:01.740]  into it that vaccines can attack your pancreas your brain you name it and then
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.340]  when your pancreas goes out they go oh it's genetic and I was talking to a
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:09.260]  medical doctor that works in a major children's hospital in central Texas and
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:12.860]  he was talking about the fact that yeah they're now connecting at two kids
[01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.700]  getting shots but they don't know what to do because they just come in all these
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:20.700]  little kids and they're now type 1 diabetics and then they have pancreatitis
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.140]  they get pancreatitis and then suddenly and I'll ask Dr. Wakeful about this
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.340]  because he's a medical doctor and then suddenly they can't process sugar
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:36.060]  anymore suddenly they don't have enough I guess it's the insulin being
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.740]  released and then now they're in the medical system for the rest of their
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:43.580]  lives and I've talked to medical doctors they're the ones telling me about this
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:47.980]  and then Rob do goes yeah did you notice in the Merck MMR shot the measles
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:52.180]  vaccine that that's one of the three things in here that it says it can give
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:56.500]  you the measles in two different spots and then it can give you pancreatitis and
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:05.740]  then diabetes it says diabetes it says diabetes it says it says diabetes and
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.980]  then I'm talking to medical doctors and they're like don't tell anybody but we
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:14.500]  think it's giving people diabetes type 1 and then it's hiding in plain view a
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.180]  lot of this is common sense I'm out there flying a drone with my cousin and my
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:23.460]  son at Joker Park the other day and I go you know I bet they're gonna put in the
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:28.020]  firmware of these because they're all GPS now even $300 one that's what
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.860]  stabilizes it to where you can't find a certain government areas and Buckley goes
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.500]  on oh David Knight did a report on that you must have missed it yeah actually
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.060]  read the owner's manual it says that there's all these areas being updated
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.860]  where you can't go and they just updated it for the White House when the same
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:45.980]  model crashed in the White House and see I was just thinking oh I bet they do
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:50.620]  this and then it was already being done I mean usually I'm not even ahead of the
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:57.580]  curve I'm on the curve or behind it I'm just willing to talk about it so I'm
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.300]  thinking oh you know for years I've heard it might be connected to pancreatitis
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:06.980]  and diabetes bleh bleh bleh bleh and it's you know it's in the insert like I'm
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:11.300]  here revealing something to you that's what's so frustrating about all this is
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:19.220]  that so much of it is cut and dry so much of it is cut and dry and we just get
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.500]  lost in all the complexity that's out there and we decided that well the
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.260]  people in charge they know what to do I'll just let them run things because
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:31.180]  people think that they're getting away with something not being involved or
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:35.300]  informed what you're getting away with is not living a good life and not being

[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:28.620]  talk about terrorism I see the headlines in the Wall Street Journal the New
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:32.860]  York Times the LA Times every day it's a full-port press and not just here but
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:38.620]  all over the Western world not just the Western world in India bullying saying
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.340]  we need to arrest people that don't vaccinate we need to take their driver's
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:44.700]  license away we need to have the IRS find them now that it's over
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:50.100]  Obamacare and here's the latest article out Time Magazine
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:56.580]  unvaccinated families addresses should be made public like you're a child
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:01.940]  molester just like they try to do concealed carry gun owners who
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:06.180]  statistically have the lowest crime rate in the country lower than off-duty
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:12.260]  police officers the second safest group not bashing the police there it is the
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:22.260]  concealed carry look it up unbelievable here's Newsweek Andrew Wakefield father
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.940]  of the anti-vaccine movement responds to the current measles outbreak for the
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:31.300]  first time and what they'll do is they'll take a prominent intelligent
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.580]  doctors scientist or the food babe who's talented and smart and a good
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:41.500]  spokesperson they'll pick them try to destroy them claim that they're a hoaxer
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:47.900]  claim they're a liar a lot of people like Brian Williams do it saying it's
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:52.140]  been proven that Obamacare doesn't you know have a death panel when it does and
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:55.580]  then they'll say this person's been discredited when they haven't been they
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.700]  engage in hoaxes saying that we're engaged in hoaxes saying safe and
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.740]  effective there are no problems when there's a secret vaccine court and they've
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:09.820]  paid out billions of dollars in the last 30 years to keep people quiet and it's
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:15.100]  happening all over the world and the inserts say it can make you sick say
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.740]  can give you Guillain beret say give you neurological disorder I'm looking at the
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:23.260]  MMR shot right here that's got the measles in it diabetes this is what it
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:28.860]  says on the back page in the reactions and side effects endocrine system
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:37.620]  diabetes digestive system pancreatitis and it goes on right down here measles
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:42.820]  like rash and then it goes on to say that if you take it for 60 days you
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:47.060]  shouldn't be around anyone because you can give it to people it says 60 days
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:59.020]  this is from Merck MMR right here so incredibly frustrating and now we have
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:05.180]  top scientists in the CDC in Merck in these big companies coming out saying
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:10.900]  yeah we covered up the link to autism see they're the ones that covered it up
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:16.620]  not Andrew Wakefield now you think about that folks they took his medical
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:22.060]  license in England his associate that was a co-author just got it back and was
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:27.380]  just exonerated last week but it's in the back of a few British newspapers
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.820]  British court throws out conviction of autism vaccine MD Andrew Wakefield's
[01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:35.820]  co-author that put the exonerated Andrew Wakefield's lawsuit against the
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:41.220]  author of what I think is a quack study by a journalist saying vaccines are
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:45.860]  totally wonderful and Wakefield engaged in deception with no proof that's what
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:52.340]  they do or they build a straw man they build a strong man like MSNBC saying
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:57.500]  Alex Jones says kill police and they show no clip because it's a you know what
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:02.540]  lie starts with a D but I'm not gonna say on there it's a lie these people you
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:08.460]  think Ryan Williams is bad you think he's bad that's nothing claiming he got
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:12.100]  shot down in a helicopter he was an hour and a half away that's nothing
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:16.860]  compared to getting up there on television like Rachel Maddow's done and
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:21.540]  like Megan Kelly has done and said listen Wakefield's totally discredited
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:25.420]  there's nothing wrong with vaccines it totally protects you get the shot it's
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:31.540]  wonderful that's a lie and they demonized Jenny McCarthy anybody that
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.740]  tries to stand up and then if we don't stand behind the leaders when we
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.420]  investigate them and find out that they were heroes not villains then they can
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.100]  take us down see that's that's what's all about if they can take down the
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:49.020]  icons they can take everybody down and so we're going to go for the rest of
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.940]  the hour a little bit of the next hour to Dr. Andrew Wakefield I just want to
[01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:59.260]  exhibit here briefly for TV viewers that I mean I'm showing you the MMR vaccine
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:03.860]  insert that came with it we got at Walgreens a month ago and it just says
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:08.580]  measles don't be around somebody for 60 days if you have it I can give you
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.140]  diabetes because you'll have pancreatitis then your pancreas doesn't turn back on
[01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:16.580]  you got you got diabetes you got type 1 diabetes I mean just says it I'm not a
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.620]  medical doctor I'm reading it this is so shocking we've gotten emails and
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:27.460]  calls saying oh it can't say that people cannot believe this now let me just show
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:31.180]  you a few other articles and we're going to go to our guest this is out of time
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:36.860]  magazine in Germany a better vaccine for politicians turns out they get a
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:40.740]  secret vaccines that don't have all the additives and that are higher standards
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:46.340]  of quality no one in the right minds debating that the science of this
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:51.340]  artificially learned immunity that he doesn't work but it has side effects and
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:55.380]  that these companies are exempt and then you're gonna cover up and imagine an
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.620]  industry that was exempted it'd be a nightmare and it is and they don't want
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:03.820]  to fix their industry they want to destroy people that stand up for public
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:09.420]  health and do their job and follow the Hippocratic oath and I'm not kissing his
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:13.460]  butt but instead of people carrying him on his shoulders he said to put his life
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.540]  back together again and they can do that to anybody continuing government to get
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:23.540]  special swine flu vaccine another headline flashback UN halts Syrian
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:28.180]  vaccination program at where dozens of children die German Chancellor ministers
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:34.020]  get special vaccine eat it up CBC Greenpeace others Monsanto
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:39.460]  cafeterias do not serve GMO do not serve it I mean I can just keep going now I
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.500]  just want to say we've got major whistleblowers going public everything's
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.500]  imploding on them right now they're about to have congressional hearings in
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:52.860]  Congress that's why they're doubling down again on Fox News demonizing this
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:58.900]  man and then they could demonize all the millions of parents that have brain
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.020]  damaged children and they can demonize all the adults and veterans that have
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:05.620]  got serious medical problems from their vaccines and tumors growing out from the
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:12.980]  injection sites I mean it's a nightmare because these people are divorced from
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.820]  reality just like bear got caught and convicted 12 years ago in French and
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:21.300]  Australian court of knowingly shipping out factor 8 filled with hepatitis and
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:25.540]  HIV to millions of hemophiliacs and and there were corporate minutes where they
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:31.740]  said so what we're shipping it just didn't care it was a death sentence a
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:40.620]  long horrible death and Bayer didn't care now are you mad at them or you mad at
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.980]  Brian Williams no let's not get mad at Brian Williams let's just say Dr. Wakefield
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:48.060]  is the bad guy so he joins us here his colleague exonerated I want to give you
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.260]  the floor how to shut up I'm just so excited walk through your colleague by
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:54.900]  the British court where your lawsuits going these huge whistleblowers coming
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.260]  out the British studies that they suppressed years before you did yours
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:01.020]  you weren't even aware of them recap for everybody we're gonna skip this
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.260]  network break this is a public service announcement call your friends and
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.740]  family tell them to tune in right now because this is probably killing more
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:12.380]  people in my view than cigarettes and it's it's it's it's and we need clean
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:17.820]  vaccines we need good drugs but we don't have them Dr. Wakefield again we
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:23.020]  salute you for your groundbreaking work and you know Galileo said that the
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.460]  earth wasn't the center of the world and they locked him up for the rest of his
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:29.060]  life so we haven't gotten to that level though they've been trying and so so we
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:33.060]  appreciate you Alex thank you very much it's great to be back I think you're
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.740]  absolutely right what we're looking at is a system that is in meltdown right
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:40.940]  now and they're in meltdown for a number of reasons you can only sustain a lie
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:45.460]  a falsehood for so long and now that Dr. William Thompson senior CDC
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:50.660]  scientist has come forward and said that they have known for 13 years that MMR
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:54.460]  vaccine is causally associated with autism and they have hidden it from the
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:17:00.140]  public from doctors from public health officials from everybody they've kept it
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:04.300]  to an inner circle of people who knew the truth all along and have allowed
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.660]  millions of children to be put in harm's way in the interim and he could no
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:12.820]  longer live with that and he's come forward with that now and one has to
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:16.980]  hope that that goes before a congressional committee sooner rather than
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:21.220]  later and if I have one message for your listeners and your viewers it is that
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:26.580]  you must implore that your congressman take this very very seriously and
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:31.020]  support Congressman Bill Posey's efforts to get this before a committee just as
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:37.700]  soon as possible looking at this now they're doubling down it's like we're
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:42.060]  Jews in Nazi Germany that we don't want to get vaccinated arrest us publish our
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:46.940]  names where we live come after us take our children I mean they're really
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:50.900]  doubling down it's desperate isn't it and it's rather like Salem or more
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.700]  recently as you point out it's rather like banning the Nazis banning Jews
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:59.580]  from using public transportation in order to avoid being contaminated by
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:03.020]  suspected infection I mean it's absolutely just oh that's what they said
[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:08.860]  yeah you're right so we're seeing that kind of reaction now to what's happening
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:13.860]  and it's very well orchestrated it's heavily funded with billions of dollars
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:18.180]  of public relations fund and it's failing it's failing it is fail as it's a lie
[01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:23.460]  and if you have a vaccination policy in this country which mandates which takes
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:27.300]  your children away which puts you at gunpoint which puts parents in prison
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:31.540]  for not vaccinating that is not built upon public trust or confidence that is
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:38.180]  a disaster and public health policy vaccination policy requires the
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.860]  confidence of the public and they have lost it wow this is epic think about it
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.460]  in America and Europe they're trying to make vaccines forced and they're coming
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:50.020]  out with hundreds of new ones where companies lobby and then government says
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.380]  it's the law to take it they tried to have Rick Perry a few years ago run the
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:57.620]  hoax of saying it was the law with the Gardasil I mean there's no there's no
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:01.340]  end to the depths and as you said I'm here following and I'm here talking to
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:05.900]  the public they're doubling tripling down it is backfiring but it shows this
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:12.260]  totalitarian instinct that now permeates government yeah let's the notion of
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.180]  treating or protecting children against serious infectious disease with safe
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:21.580]  and effective vaccines is a laudable one we know we both reckon I want them
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:26.260]  absolutely but the current schedule and certainly MMR meets none of those
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:33.020]  criteria none at all and we have a major major problem let me characterize this
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:38.380]  there are measles outbreaks apparently now in California and elsewhere MMR
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:42.820]  vaccine measles mumps rebella vaccine does not protect against measles measles
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:47.140]  vaccine protects against measles and the only recommendation that I have ever
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:52.900]  made in respect of MMR is to give them separately and delay them so that you
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.840]  have a an interval between each fact that's what the Japanese have done for
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.140]  20 years well the Japanese are an extremely good example because the
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:04.500]  Japanese had MMR they don't want a bunch of brain damage children when MMR came
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:09.420]  in in Japan there was a dramatic rise in the incidence of autism what they found
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.380]  is that the vaccine caused meningitis the mumps strain of the vaccine caused
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.560]  meningitis public confidence was lost and the vaccine was stopped and the
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.460]  backs the uptake of of the vaccine and the decline in the use of the vaccine
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:28.220]  exactly mirrors the rising and falling incidence of autism now what happened
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.380]  next was that there was a rebound a dramatic rebound in the incidence of
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:37.300]  autism it went up skyrocketed why they never used MMR again but what the
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.020]  vaccine policy recommendation was in Japan was to use to give children at
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:48.140]  12 months the measles and rubella vaccine on the same day and to give
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:52.780]  voluntary months vaccination not less than four weeks later now that in many
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:58.540]  ways is still giving combination viral vaccines so you're recapitulating the
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:04.900]  same problem that you have with MMR now the kicker is Alex that the single
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.300]  mumps vaccine the one that caused meningitis when it was given on its own
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:14.300]  cause little or no meningitis at all it was when it was put into the MMR that
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:17.180]  there was an unacceptable level of meningitis what does that tell us it
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:22.580]  tells us that you get a novel unexpected adverse event associated with the
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.540]  combination vaccine that you did not get with a single and you studied this
[01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.460]  but the dr. Blalock who's coined a lot of terms that are now in mainline
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:34.580]  medical journals says that there's a basically an adjuvant effect of mixing
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:39.620]  them together it just makes them many times more powerful mixing them or what
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:43.940]  is it it certainly alters their behavior and this was recognized as soon as they
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:48.300]  were put together it's called viral interference and they were concerned that
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:52.540]  it influences the protective immune response there was no concern what
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:58.020]  so ever except amongst the Japanese about safety no concern you cannot take
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:03.820]  three live viral agents and put them into combination and just expect that one
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.020]  and one and one equal three they don't be and I saw they're now coming out with
[01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:10.740]  some vaccines they're floating and have as many as 10 yes now there were they
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:14.300]  for example with the live viral vaccines they put in the chicken pox vaccine
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.780]  when they did that it doubled the rate of febrile convulsions there again is a
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.700]  classic example of more is not better but these inserts say they can give you
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:27.420]  convulsions so so so why are we being attacked when the insert says all this
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:32.420]  I wonder how many patients or parents actually get to see that insert Alex I
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:36.180]  wonder how many people ask for it and I wonder how many doctors spontaneously
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:41.340]  show it in as part of the informed consent process very very few well we
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:45.060]  told folks that there were some tips on to win the lottery in here maybe fantasy
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.020]  football they might read it but I mean if I was gonna put any drug I'm gonna put
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:52.100]  my body I don't care what it is antibiotics anything I go read the
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:56.500]  insert you want to know what's in there this is just crazy and for those that
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:00.660]  don't know each vial of the MMR or any other vaccine or drug in the box with it
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:07.060]  by law comes this so they have this at Walgreens at CVS I think parents need the
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.220]  choice they need the choice in the presence of the current concerns about
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:14.180]  the safety of MMR vaccine they must have a choice of how to protect their
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:18.140]  children against infectious disease well I know you're here warning people you
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:22.660]  know as a doctor and you're trying to save folks but but tell us about your
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:26.420]  story recapping it briefly where it is where your lawsuit is your co-author
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:30.220]  being exonerated I know you're moving towards that you've been exonerated with
[01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:33.620]  the whistleblowers the previous studies but this has got to really hurt the
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:38.140]  people that tried to destroy you as just fate would have it all this evidence
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:42.100]  pours out well Alex I've been in this 20 years now and that's a feel of like
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:46.860]  many many lifetimes but we listen to parents who said that my child was
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:50.780]  perfectly normal I'm not anti-vaccine I took my child to get vaccinated when I
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:54.900]  did that they got the MMR and they regressed into autism and they also
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:59.660]  developed gastrointestinal symptoms and as a physician interested in gastrointestinal
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:03.660]  disease I recommended those children should get investigated for that they
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:07.260]  were investigated by the world's leading pediatric gastroenterologist at the time
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.460]  professor Walker Smith who you've just mentioned my co-author on the paper and
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:15.860]  he found that they had an inflammatory bowel disease we treated that disease not
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:20.860]  only did the bowel disease symptoms improve but the behavioral and autistic
[01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:25.460]  symptoms improved it was the beginning of a fascinating journey but we had to
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.620]  investigate whether the parents were also right about whether the vaccine had
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:34.300]  precipitated in this word that's when the problem started and so Murdoch's bought
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.980]  his team of journalists along Brian dear they came up with this extraordinary
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:43.860]  story that we had involved ourselves in fraud and deception that we had made it
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.920]  up there was no ethical approval all of this kind of thing while at the same
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:51.420]  time holding back from the general medical counseling inquiry vital
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:56.300]  documents that showed there was indeed ethical approval for this study he knew
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:00.140]  throughout the investigation and the proceedings that he had in his
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:04.460]  possession key documents that was an obstruction of justice have you ever
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:09.380]  physically been around this guy I was you I bet you get angry I get angry but
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:14.660]  you know it's it's not about me it's not about me Alex no I know but I mean
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:17.480]  this guy's trying to cover up what's going on with children these are
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.620]  despicable character in my opinion yeah one thing I cannot forgive him for is the
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.780]  damage done to the children because now we are many many years on and because the
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:28.780]  bowel disease in the minds of many was synonymous with vaccine injury that had
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:34.020]  to be declared a fraud as well because people were getting such good results
[01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:39.180]  in slowing or reversing it God forbid we get a treatment for this that's right
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:42.860]  and the trouble is that all of those children did not even get investigated
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:46.900]  because doctors were terrified of doing the right thing terrified of looking
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.500]  after their patients properly of treating these that's right trying to
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:53.060]  destroy you was meant to scare everybody off before this got further
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.140]  investigated but go back into turns out there've been some other studies that
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:01.220]  you didn't know about that had found similar things yeah now there have been
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:06.540]  studies from Canada from the Far East from here in America confirming that
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:10.140]  beyond the doubt these children have a novel inflammatory bowel disease in
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:14.300]  many cases that is amenable to treatment and the key is not to walk away from the
[01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.300]  fight because if you walk away from the fight other doctors are just going to
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:21.460]  have a lot no yardstick by which to judge what they should I know you had
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:26.380]  be very careful in science even going off other studies and things because
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.340]  they'll take what you're saying out of context and claim oh he's saying this
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.620]  always saying that but when I have doctor a play lock on is a famous brain
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:37.540]  surgeon and you know wrote major papers on endricans and on so many other things
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:42.020]  and excitotoxins I mean in the inserts I'm no doctor but I can sit here and
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.060]  read all the things that this does I know I work for a large animal vet for a
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.860]  year a small animal vet for three years in high school and they would say tell
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:53.980]  people don't vaccinate your pet every year it's causing them to have convulsions
[01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.700]  it's causing them to have allergies it's causing them to have diarrhea it's
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:00.060]  causing them to die and so they've kind of got the loss change now where they
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:03.100]  vaccinate every three to four years and animals are a lot better though the
[01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:06.540]  lobby's coming back trying to say every year now so it's the same thing so I
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:12.260]  was 15 16 years old listening to Jess Adkins large animal that needs Texas you
[01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.620]  know saying you know these vaccines we've got some problems so I mean I
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:19.260]  remember hearing about that but if I read this insert for the MMR shot
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:25.300]  Merkin Co. Inc. White House Station New Jersey when I sit here and I read this
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:31.180]  it says diabetes pancreatitis guion beret I mean I mean it says all these
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:35.180]  neurological disorders it says it can kill you I mean it's it's just page
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:40.620]  after page in Bible paper it's super thin saying all the stuff it can do
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:47.300]  measles like rashes so as best we can tell what is it doing it's causing an
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:52.180]  autoimmune thing an inflammation in the pancreas in the intestines in the
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:54.940]  brain what's happening doctor just come back to the point you made the vets
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:58.660]  were way ahead of the curve the vets recognize these problems and dealt with
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:03.100]  them far far sooner than than medical professionals have and they took the
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:07.580]  thimerosol the mercury preservative out of vaccines many years before it was
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:11.700]  even considered to be taken out of human vaccines because they recognize that it
[01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:15.460]  was doing harm and as you say they spaced the vaccines out because they
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:19.060]  recognize they would give me the pets were being even given too many vaccines
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:23.140]  too frequently so if only we took a lead from the vets we wouldn't
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:26.660]  necessarily be in the same position we are now now how's it working well I
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:30.740]  think there are many many ways and the trouble is Alex by the time we see these
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:34.820]  children they are so sick and their systems are so deranged that it's very
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:39.300]  difficult to say what happened first tracing it back to the first thing that
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:44.380]  went wrong is very very difficult but certainly the immune system is very much
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:49.300]  disturbed there is an autoimmune component the body turns upon itself and
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:53.940]  so I think it's in large part an immune mediated disease that affects not just
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:59.380]  the brain but the rest of the body systems as well in many cases so poison
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:06.260]  ivy is an autoimmune issue AIDS is when your team lymphocytes are gone and you
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:12.300]  lose the programmer cells I guess I mean as best from all my years of
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:16.380]  researching the medical literature it just seems like it's causing a serious
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:21.180]  autoimmune disorder I've also seen a lot of reports linking Crohn's disease
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:25.380]  that's really expanding and growing and spreading to people that have been
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:29.300]  vaccinated yeah we well that's where how we got into this initially looking at
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:33.700]  measles vaccine and Crohn's disease and we still don't know the answer on that
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:38.300]  because these diseases are so complex causation is not simple but we know
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:42.020]  they're exploding right now we absolutely know that there are epidemics of
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:46.860]  these immune diseases which are seen in the most highly vaccinated populations
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:51.100]  of the world and are far less common in those children that's right in the lower

[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:26.660]  normal response to get excited to get upset to get motivated when you sit here
[01:33:26.660 --> 01:33:30.260]  and you know about the history of secret experimentation you know about all the
[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:34.500]  problems of vaccines you know about major pharmaceutical companies knowing
[01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:38.220]  that their products are killing people and then I was talking to one of the top
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.300]  people in the state who happened to run into and I looked them up later and it
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:47.660]  was who they said they were basically right near the top of the state vaccine
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:53.980]  program and he said Alex we do know that it's hurting people but there's a
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:58.900]  greater good in the vaccination overall so we're you know we're kind of but but
[01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:03.020]  we are aware and and we know it's it's true and we know it's causing the
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:06.620]  neurological disorders and I talked to the guy on the high come back trial for
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:11.060]  like 20 minutes and he said just you know you I tell you I am but just don't
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:15.060]  say my name and I went and Google name and there he was but he seemed like he
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.580]  was struggling with himself but he had the rationalization but the injustice
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:24.900]  the means no it doesn't because most these vaccines don't even protect you
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:27.380]  look at diarrhea vaccine they have was killing a bunch of kids they had to pull
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:31.700]  off the market you know sometimes it's a blessing that it's so bad it kills so
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:36.180]  many like Gardasilic it's banned in Japan and restricted in other countries not
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:42.420]  here of course America is a dumping ground so is the UK where people just
[01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:47.180]  line up and worship the the gods in the white lab coats well the gods in the
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:53.380]  white lab coats aren't doctors more and more they're just delivery boys delivery
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:57.500]  girls for big pharma and their robots and now under Obamacare the National
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:02.580]  Health Service in England pretty much you you medically do what the standard
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:07.460]  computerized order tells you is what you do when you enter in this criteria and
[01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:11.500]  that's the move towards phasing humans out you'll just have technicians over
[01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:15.860]  computers and over systems decide what to do we have a government that has
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.420]  secret death lists for the veterans that's come out in the news and they
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:24.340]  have the IBM Watson computer decides who to give treatment who not to so the
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:27.780]  bioethics board doesn't feel bad they don't have to you know not treat the
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:30.940]  55 year old vet who's had a heart attack and they go well he might only live
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.740]  10 years the actuary shows and so it's not worth it in the money just let him
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:37.260]  die of a heart attack or the computer says you'll probably die within six
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:43.260]  months I mean that comes out in the news and we're like well you know and let's
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:50.740]  just trust the system no there is social engineering going on above this
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.820]  Dr. Wakefield doesn't go there and I don't even ask him when he thinks he's
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:59.940]  going on at the bottom of the rabbit hole I know when Bayer said you know what
[01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:04.380]  to the world of fair there's too many hemophilia acts it's like Dr. Sox
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:07.860]  associate on that PBS report said yeah it turns out hundreds of millions of
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:11.460]  people were given a polio vaccine that had cancer viruses in it we estimate a
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.860]  lot of people got cancer and died from it he goes but we'll joke there are too
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:20.580]  many people I could play that clip right now if you'd like me to so that's the
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:24.020]  larger issue I'm gonna give our guests the floor as best I can to really get
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:27.300]  into all the things that have happened what's unfolded let him roll for a while
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:32.140]  because he's so polite he'll pause and I'll take over but this is epic stuff and
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:35.380]  we're on the verge of bringing these people down on so many fronts Brian
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:39.860]  Williams is just one window into that Hillary Clinton all of these people
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:43.700]  they're the hoaxers they're the fraudsters and we got to get our human

[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:04.860]  as strong when we discovered the crystal source and we went around to all the
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:08.540]  other manufacturers and big companies and just could not put our name on it and
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:14.300]  so it took us years to finally come up with this and it's groundbreaking

[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:37.300]  questions I can rant and rave brief the people out there where we are now in
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:41.340]  this totalitarian push to force an oculation now it's do or die we're
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:44.500]  close to breaking their back that's why we're seeing their battle the bulge
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:49.220]  moment when let's just compare them to Hitler that we've driven them back we're
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:53.060]  winning and they hit us with everything they've got but you can see that Jeb
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:57.260]  Dietrich out there leading this attack doesn't have the moral high ground he's
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:01.360]  gonna fail I don't care how big and black his army tanks are the ground troops
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:05.860]  are out there with their bazookas we're taking these tanks out right now let's
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.220]  talk about what's happening you've got the floor. Well I think you've
[01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:12.900]  characterized it very well this is a do or die moment it's absolutely crucial in
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.900]  the history of this country and indeed the world of who prevails who do your
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:22.460]  children actually belong to and if we do not get William Thompson before a
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:27.380]  congressional series of committees that unearthed precise nature and extent of
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:31.020]  the fraud at the CDC and how they that's the big whistleblower that is the big
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:36.500]  whistleblower then if we do not do that and if we lose this battle your children
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:40.700]  you will be owned by the pharmaceutical industry and your children and your
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:45.260]  children's children's slavery and they are simply a marketplace for those
[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:50.260]  companies they are quantified in terms of vaccination for every birth in how
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:54.380]  much revenue they will generate for the pharmaceutical industry in a mandated
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:59.900]  program for which there is no real recourse to any kind of compensational
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:03.500]  litigation if your children are harmed so they want to take away your rights as
[01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.740]  to whether your children should be vaccinated or not according to your
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:11.260]  decision but if your child is harmed and vaccines are according to the Supreme
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:16.620]  Court unavoidably unsafe then you are left to pick up the pieces and that is
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:20.300]  the system that we face and at the end of it is a massive profit for the
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.780]  pharmaceutical industry now the way to do this Alex is to get your congressman
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:28.620]  to support Bill Posey and you must do this it's no good sitting there so we
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:32.540]  made it easy for you go to the autismmedia channel.com and on there
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:38.940]  are 30 pages of complaint that I have written with Dr. Brian Hooker which
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:43.380]  characterized precisely the fraud committed by the CDC based upon the
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:48.580]  documents provided to us by William Thompson the whistleblower and those
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:52.260]  documents must be put in the hands of your congressman so that they know
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:55.980]  exactly what happened and then they can give Bill Posey his support in getting
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:59.020]  this to committee. That's right highlight them go to their offices or when
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:02.420]  they're back in your state and give it to them hold them by the hand and say
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:06.620]  listen kids are getting hurt you read this fraud and get up off your butt and
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:10.300]  here's the thing those those congressional that they're in the
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:13.980]  recess next week so they are coming back many of them to their district you
[01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:18.300]  can go and meet them in your district you don't have to travel to DC but you
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:23.300]  make sure that every congressman in this country is aware of exactly what's
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:28.220]  going on because at the moment farmer lobbyists are scaling Capitol Hill like
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:33.260]  orcs storming Helms deep it's a hideous site and even though you can see they're
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:36.740]  huge offensive I mean this is this is this is battle the bulge I mean this
[01:43:36.740 --> 01:43:40.700]  they're throwing everything they've got and this is a matter between Congress and
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:45.900]  a congressional agents or a federal agency the CDC it shouldn't involve the
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:51.500]  farmer lobbyists at all but the congressman should have the chutzpatter say
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:56.020]  to them this is none of your business you may be indirectly affected by the
[01:43:56.020 --> 01:44:00.340]  outcome of this but this is between us and a federal agency that has a
[01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:05.420]  committed an alleged fraud so get out of my office and wait for the result well
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:08.620]  think about with government-run health care that's run by special interest and
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:13.340]  written by it they can just make us buy whatever quote health products they want
[01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:18.260]  including tainted vaccines this is super high-tech slavery I mean this is over
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:24.380]  the top yeah so please go to autism media channel.com download those PDF
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:29.780]  documents and get them in front of your representative do not hesitate next week
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:33.540]  they will be back in district and they will be available to you so make it
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:39.860]  happen because if we lose this battle we lose it for a very very long time.
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:45.620]  Elaborate on how where's the lawsuit going how your colleague the co-author
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:49.620]  super prestigious I mean I looked him up like you said one of the top you know
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:54.500]  gastro experts in the UK or Europe that's why they were so scared of you
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:58.500]  guys and had to shut you down as your smart will spoken prestigious getting
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:02.620]  results helping people had to be destroyed but they failed you came back
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:07.140]  like the phoenix and that's so exciting so so break down where that fight's
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:10.700]  going right now as well. Certainly let me start with John Walker Smith when the
[01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:14.780]  GMC rendered their opinion and had a their decision and had us struck off the
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:19.060]  medical register in the UK both Dr. Professor Walker Smith and I filed an
[01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:24.220]  appeal and I did not get funded for my appeal it would have cost me about five
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:27.940]  hundred thousand pounds which I didn't have to fight that appeal so I had to
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:31.180]  withdraw my because they destroyed your livelihood right his was funded and he
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:35.100]  took it to the High Court this was the first time it had ever been in front of
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:40.340]  a proper judiciary the judge justice-mitting destroyed the GMC destroyed
[01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:45.340]  them he essentially accused them of being incompetent unable to incompetent
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:49.020]  unable to handle evidence they did not know how to they were he accused them of
[01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:53.580]  being biased they rejected evidence that was valid they had no idea what they
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:56.860]  were doing yes they did actually because they were doing it deliberately well
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:59.820]  they were setting you up they had been given their marching orders and they
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.540]  were going to get a guilty verdict whatever and at the end of it
[01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:07.380]  the council on behalf of the GMC admitted said we're sorry we know
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:12.380]  this mistakes were made and we didn't handle this properly and the judge
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.780]  said it would be a shame if this were ever to happen again you go away and you
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:21.140]  change your whole process of conducting these fitness to practice inquiries so
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:26.220]  it was demolished however they got what they wanted and that was taking my
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:29.860]  license away and now autism rates have gone I mean I mean they vary the
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:33.220]  highest or in South Korea correct me if I'm wrong it's like one in 30 something
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:39.100]  it's 150 something here now was a one in 68 it was one in 25,000 30 years ago I
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:45.300]  mean I can see the children when I'm at the grocery store or I'm out in public
[01:46:45.300 --> 01:46:49.860]  kids aren't looking too good and the babies aren't and I mean they go to a
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:55.020]  movie theater sometimes the thing is just full of autistic children God bless
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:47:01.580]  her little hearts you know babbling and just going through hell and I go to
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:05.300]  doctors offices sometimes you know take my children to the pediatrician and I'll
[01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:09.100]  be in there and there's like 15 kids and like five of them are autistic I mean
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:14.020]  this is an epidemic well is it gonna be one in 10 one in five one in two I mean
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:18.900]  how long will this go how many I mean good does half the population have to
[01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:22.140]  be sitting in the corner and diapers cussing when they're 15 years old
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:25.380]  screaming at their parents before we do something I think the way to look at this
[01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:29.580]  Alex is look at the CDC's own numbers on this and look at the trend over time
[01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:35.700]  the it's now what as they say around one in 50 if you extrapolate from that and
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:39.980]  you look at the risk for autism for a child born today it's one in 25 and
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:45.100]  it's estimated that by what 2025 we one in two children will have autism if
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:49.500]  nothing is done about it and that is completely the situation now is
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:54.500]  completely unacceptable but that will be a disaster no economy in the world can
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:48:00.140]  sustain that kind of attrition of its population so something has got to be
[01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:04.180]  done immediately well yeah something was done have you read eco science written
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:09.860]  by the current White House science are I have not it's pretty interesting they
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:14.700]  talk about social engineering through through medical systems water and
[01:48:14.700 --> 01:48:19.900]  vaccines to get people in line pretty pretty interesting it was written by
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:24.260]  they think there's too many people Paul R. Erlich Annie H. Erlich and John P.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:29.540]  Holdren and this book is digitally online for free they try to pull it down
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:34.140]  when people find it because it's pretty shocking this was basically adopted by
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:39.940]  UNESCO as a global shadow policy to carry out social engineering through
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:44.540]  medicine right we'll keep an eye on your copy Alex I might have to steal it
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:47.300]  before I go well you can borrow it you're certainly welcome to thank you
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:51.780]  but you know the other issue is what happens okay there are two elements to
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.300]  this there's the epidemic that's occurring now and then there are the
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.540]  children who are already damaged what do we do about those children as they age
[01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:02.620]  out and they become adults as you say sitting in diapers at the age of 15
[01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:07.940]  2025 unable to cope unable to deal with themselves and we had its tragic case
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:11.980]  here in Austin the other day of a young man who was in a group home in the
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:16.140]  district in the community and a simple thing happened I think someone stood on
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:20.260]  a DVD of his he had a meltdown he went running around the district knocking on
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:25.860]  doors and he was shot four times shot to death that these people cannot cope in
[01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:30.180]  the community they have no scary one a 25 year old autistic man's at your door
[01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:33.980]  and we're sad he got shot but I mean it and cops are shooting them all the time
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:37.460]  to because you get some guy running at your screaming I mean it's nobody
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:39.820]  understands the problem this is the problem people out there in the
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:43.820]  community do not understand what autism is or that these individuals have no
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:48.340]  sense of danger whatsoever so what are we gonna do with all of these autistic
[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:53.380]  adults and that's a tragedy and someone here in Austin polytomy is creating the
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:57.460]  autism trust to provide a long-term home for these individuals where they
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:50:01.860]  won't be drugged they won't be simply put on psychotropic medications which have
[01:50:01.860 --> 01:50:06.420]  no indication in autism whatsoever but make life easier for the carers I think
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:11.620]  I met him out in Lakeway it poly is you probably met her husband husband and
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.380]  wife team and he was showing me all the stuff they're gonna build the campus
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:19.180]  pretty absolutely that's right so it's an exciting time for people here in
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:22.420]  Austin but one of these places is not gonna be anywhere near enough you could
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:26.700]  deal with you can have 10 or 15 Austin alone let alone the rest of Texas or the

[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:50.740]  Vietnam was they found that would debilitate the Vietnamese if they had
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.820]  to have five people take care of somebody was just wounded instead of dead

[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:39.580]  AutismMediaChannel.com I was about to say if I knew that a car was
[01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:44.100]  pumped over outside on a child I would jump up with energy I would run out
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:48.500]  there and I would try to get the child out front of the car because I've done
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:51.660]  that before you know been on the highway in a car flips people are stuck we help
[01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:55.380]  get people out not a hero I saved a lady one time with a
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:58.940]  homic maneuver came out of the bathroom no one was helping the lady she was
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:02.900]  turning blue falling over on the table they just kept saying call 911 call 911
[01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:08.660]  call 911 and then I went over there and she coughed up all this bread and people
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:13.020]  thought I was a hero then that's why we're in so much trouble is that it's
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:18.660]  not heroic to do the right thing to help people and the instinct to stand up
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:21.940]  against tyranny has been lost to a great extent everybody needs to go to
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:27.820]  AutismMediaChannel.com get the data send it to Congress get involved today
[01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:33.020]  because there is a war going on we need to mobilize against big pharma and the
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:39.020]  social engineers that are engaged in this we need to take action and I got to
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:42.540]  tell you Dr. Wakefield your partner's been exonerated you don't have the money
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:45.340]  to go through the process you were saying during the break they should just
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:48.820]  you know exonerate you but they don't want to step down that far and admit
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:53.460]  that they're that wrong but what are they going to do as the vaccines just keep
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:58.180]  ravaging everyone they're going to lose this fight in the end well one thing I
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:02.620]  would talk about the one of the most insidious problems with this is that I
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:08.500]  was sent a seventh graders test the other day standardized test for seventh
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:15.820]  graders across the country and it said ten years ago a doctor wrote a paper he
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:21.380]  made it all up and since then we've all been much sicker and then there were a
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:26.500]  series of questions that these seventh graders had to answer which went along
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:30.580]  with that notion that there was fraud it was all made up the children weren't
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:34.860]  being damaged that vaccines weren't causing problems and here's the problem
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:42.380]  that you had to give them the answer they wanted so to pass the test you had
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:47.700]  to comply and to comply you had to lie and that is the poisoning of young
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:53.860]  minds that is what the Nazis did in schools to alienate school children
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:57:00.380]  from foreigners from the Jews they call them foreigners how many aliens they say
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:05.380]  lived in this country houselanders absolutely extraordinary and that same
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:11.340]  thing is happening now in schools and if you do not give them the answer you
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:15.060]  what they want you will fail the test well that's common core that's exactly
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:19.860]  what they do the questions like guns are killing more people now how do we
[01:57:19.860 --> 01:57:24.740]  stop it we ban them and they're just putting brainwashing directly in to the
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:29.100]  test themselves it's outrageous it's incredible because you know what that
[01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:33.340]  will do is self-select those people who are compliant not the people who think
[01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:39.100]  critically and ask questions and say no actually I've read differently or my
[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:44.020]  child my sorry my my sibling my brother or sister experienced this and I know
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:49.060]  that vaccine damage the real problem fail out look at this article McDonald's

[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:22.700]  viral agents or extracts of viral agents that have a known downside and yet
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:26.300]  they're being given in McDonald's in what exchange for a happy meal absolutely

[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:13.540]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:21.060]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[02:00:21.060 --> 02:00:27.860]  Texas alex jones. Dr. Andrew Wakefield has been exonerated by CDC whistleblowers
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:33.300]  Merck whistleblowers his colleague one of the top gut experts in the UK just
[02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:39.300]  exonerated after years of battle and the court absolutely eviscerated the
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:45.260]  government agency that engaged in this quackery it's just amazing what's
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:49.380]  going on so the fight is joint he is exonerated but the word isn't out on
[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:52.460]  that yet you're making a new documentary of another documentary that
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:56.300]  has been very successful winning at film festivals it's now available tell
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:00.500]  folks about the film well one I decided some years ago Alex that to beat the
[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:03.740]  media you have to become the media and you've made that decision yourself I'm
[02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:07.380]  sure many years ago and get the message out there and we have so many
[02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:10.700]  extraordinary stories that I've learned over the last 20 years from these
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:14.380]  parents that it was time to tell those stories and the one that we produced is
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:19.940]  a film called who kill alex border markets it's a tragic tale of a child in
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:25.100]  Chicago was a 14 year old with severe autism who was ultimately killed by his
[02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:30.420]  mother and his godmother is yes his godmother now we started filming them
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:34.660]  as a way of showing how these children could be helped but he fell foul of a
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:39.580]  medical system which was totally and utterly inadequate this is a system that
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:44.300]  put this child on over 25 so but psychotropic drugs only two of which are
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:51.020]  licensed by the FDA for the treatment of children with autism only two so this
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:55.180]  is quackery this is true quackery and it's where the way that this system is
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:59.020]  going and that's got to change so the story highlights one of the most
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:04.500]  poignant and distressing aspects of of the way in which this country now
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:07.380]  handles children with autism and we made it in order that this should never
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:11.060]  happen again these parents should never have been put through that well what
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:15.260]  about with all the bioethics talking about just getting rid of people that
[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:20.580]  have any type of mental disability or whatever warehouse and death panels I
[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:25.380]  mean I think when you once you get to one in ten people with autism I'm not
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:29.380]  saying do this but it'll be we're going to collapse we won't be able to take
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:32.740]  care of all these people and the state's gonna say kill them yeah the moment that
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:37.180]  you consider any individual member of a society expendable then you have lost
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:41.060]  your moral compass and that is exactly what is happening at the moment and it's
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:44.980]  being done because market forces are dictating that what do you think of the
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:48.700]  secret death panels that came out with the VA and they just swept that under the
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:51.660]  rug to now I just heard about that for the first time from you see they hardly
[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:56.020]  even got coverage can you believe on IBM computer decides who shall live and who
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:02:59.860]  shall that happen in Nazi Germany when people say quit using the Nazi analogy
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:05.660]  it's it's dead on though yeah no it's a very very good historical yardstick for
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:09.620]  so many of the things that can go wrong in society if bad people get in
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:14.580]  control and good people do not act to restore the integrity of that society so
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:19.340]  it is a very good yardstick and it it's entirely appropriate to use it well I
[02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:22.340]  got called aside by my children's pediatrician who runs one of the biggest
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:26.180]  clinics in Austin he's retired now this is like six seven years ago he said
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:29.500]  listen I get why you're not vaccinating your kids because you know he has one of
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.980]  those big clinics where he won't push you to but most his kids go in there do
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:36.300]  get him he goes I volunteered for a clinic you know doctors are supposed to
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:40.180]  do that for folks that don't know and he's awesome we were giving him live
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:44.020]  polio vaccine that's supposed to be illegal for 20 years he goes it's got
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:49.780]  sv-40 he got they grabbed my arm he goes but you don't tell anybody my name but
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:54.260]  I mean what that's how scared doctors are yeah they're terrified and what
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:58.740]  happened to me was has now become Wakefield it they call it Wakefield it
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:04.700]  may even get into Wikipedia you know of this phenomenon of isolating doctors
[02:04:04.700 --> 02:04:09.100]  destroying their credibility and saying to everybody else if you get involved if
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:12.580]  you question vaccine safety if you criticize our drug this is what will
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:15.500]  happen to you do you remember that mark vioxx trial in Australia where they
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:21.420]  produced the the inter the internal emails for executives talking about how
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:25.500]  they would deal with doctors who criticize they said isolate them destroy
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:30.460]  them kill them I think you may have to seek them out and destroy them where
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:34.260]  they live and when Matt Lauer asked me about this in interview he said well
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:36.820]  what you're talking about is really conspiracy theory isn't it nice of
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:39.740]  it's interesting you should say that Matt because this is what came out in
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:43.660]  Australia in the vioxx trials there and it sounds a little more like corporate
[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:48.860]  policy than conspiracy theory sounds like mafia to me we salute you autism

[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:26.260]  tracker boxes that can remote control your vehicle in them the Justice

[02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:37.540]  records about motorists it's like the elite or space aliens or something with
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:41.820]  a master plan it's so evil it's so sadistic no it's the devil I mean
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:47.900]  that's it this galactic force of destruction that's animating people to
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:10:00.220]  do this the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show and
[02:10:00.220 --> 02:10:08.500]  if you're listening to this transmission you are our hope the globalist hide in
[02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:14.500]  plain view and they hide behind the complexity of our world I can't keep
[02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:20.660]  track of my personal checking account sometime and bills and you know children
[02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:31.140]  and events and family and illnesses and I get it and so we're all just atomized
[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:35.620]  on our own the systems divided us all against each other in hundreds of
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:44.380]  different ways and it hit me this morning I stayed up late last night I
[02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:51.380]  still woke up like six in the morning when I was laying there in bed I just
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:57.700]  thought wow the president really is bringing in all the illegals outside of
[02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:04.060]  the law and giving them tax refunds and letting them vote and it's all over the
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:11.380]  news and they really are putting our military under NATO command and
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:15.060]  Obamacare really is designed to get rid of doctors and patients having any
[02:11:15.060 --> 02:11:18.860]  decision-making and it really is a monumental screwjob and I just think
[02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:25.420]  about all the bad things they're doing and realizing that the worst I've
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:32.260]  projected onto the New World Order is a whitewash I mean I mean everything I
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:37.180]  say I believe what I say but then I hear how extreme it is but it's true and
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:40.420]  then it's worse
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:52.420]  and then I had one of those rare moments in my life where I felt not fear but
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:12:03.620]  beyond sadness it's it's like a feeling of regret I've psychoanalyzed it that's
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:08.740]  why I can't stand people thanking me because you're such good people you're
[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:14.740]  so wonderful I can see your soul in your eyes and you're believing in me I'm a
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:20.460]  failed person part of this system so I'm not what needs to be thanked it's the
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:24.740]  freedom that needs to be protected and the liberty and the truth that is what
[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:33.900]  is important not the messenger because I feel completely angry with myself that
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:38.700]  I want to go to a concert I want to go to a movie I want to sit around my buddies
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:44.740]  and you know I want to go play pool and make jokes you know I'm just like a
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:51.460]  regular guy I want to go sit around a deer camp and and you know eat deer
[02:12:51.460 --> 02:13:02.980]  chili and I do do some of that and then it's just a paradox because I've got to
[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:05.860]  have some rest and relaxation at the same time I mean we're living in a
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:09.900]  science fiction movie just like I said in that promo earlier I mean this stuff's
[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:15.900]  real I mean it's it just hit me and I I got up when I went in the bathroom came
[02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:21.940]  out and I just kneel down on the ground and I wasn't even really praying to God
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:27.620]  I just it was a normal response to just want to get in a kneeled position my
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:34.740]  whole body my soul going my God what do we do to stop these people and I just
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:38.900]  constantly now today few weeks ago I had just went off air you know I said
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:43.340]  Dave and I just come in here and take over because this same feeling hit me of
[02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:50.460]  like waiting for something it's like a computer waiting for the answer and the
[02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:53.220]  machines are spinning it's like in that movie the imitation game and they're
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:56.380]  waiting for the computer to give the answer and to see if it works for weeks
[02:13:56.380 --> 02:14:00.020]  and that's what I feel like all this news all this data all the things the
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:04.020]  enemy's doing all the globalist operations how they how they set up like
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:08.620]  perpetual motion machines these programs these wars of evil these drug wars
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:14.580]  war on illiteracy war on mental illness it all just makes it worse how they
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:18.380]  set up these centralized systems and I could see the systems I know how their
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:22.780]  systems operate I can go read books written by globalist 20 years ago and
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:27.340]  they're writing things that I'd already totally understood just seeing their
[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:34.140]  operation but then I'm reading them laying it out and then they actually did
[02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:41.060]  it I could see the code basically of their operations everywhere it's not
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:47.900]  hard it's it's it's once you know their program it's almost like matrix code you
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:51.700]  can see their philosophies how they operate it's like if you study
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:55.620]  criminology and you learn how different criminal groups operate they'll have a
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:15:00.060]  modus operandi they'll they'll they'll have a system they'll have a philosophy
[02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:08.060]  they'll have a culture and for 20 plus years I've been immersed in the globalist
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:13.300]  culture really watching them really learning who they are and man I'm
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:24.860]  telling you folks the actress that came out and played the queen you know the
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:28.420]  queen movie that came out a few years ago she's in the news saying that is that
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:32.580]  the Royals are aliens that's in the news I don't think they're aliens folks but
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:37.420]  they might as well be and I just have come to that hard realization that these
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:42.900]  people it's not like we're a pig in the back yard they're gonna slaughter for
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:45.900]  Christmas and you're kind of sorry for the pig and give it a nice meal the day
[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:56.140]  before he slows throat it's that they enjoy hauling us up by our trotters and
[02:15:56.140 --> 02:16:05.580]  split North Road I mean they really want to hurt us I mean they are too boy
[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:10.380]  actresses Royals are aliens the world they live in is so beyond our
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:18.460]  understanding London independent Helen Mirren everybody that gets around these
[02:16:18.460 --> 02:16:21.340]  people that's what they say
[02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:27.300]  by the way you know this top reporter that just died at 50 something years of
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:33.620]  age yeah he talked to Snowden and then he dropped dead and by the way it was
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:36.100]  obvious they killed that guy he was about to give testimony that would bring
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:43.460]  down the Argentinian president so now she's been charged in a cover-up
[02:16:44.220 --> 02:16:50.140]  former first lady turned president people say oh no nobody killed the
[02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:55.820]  investigator of course they killed him David Carr times critic and champion of
[02:16:55.820 --> 02:17:02.420]  media dies at 58 and they're talking to Snowden that articles up on info wars
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:04.940]  calm
[02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:11.860]  what I'm saying is I get lost in all this minutiae but then I get to the point
[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:14.740]  where I could do a really interesting radio show right now if each of these
[02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:19.260]  articles and tied into things and you know it'd be informative but that's not
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:24.620]  going to win the war we've got to somehow get people out of their comfort
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:29.300]  zones to pull back and realize your life's being programmed for you you're
[02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:33.100]  having your free will taken and a lot of people that have already had their free
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:37.980]  will partially taken they are slaves they are zombies they're not people and
[02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:42.420]  the globalist have these weird metaphysical rules they've got to get
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:52.500]  you to turn your soul over and turn your free will over and then then they can
[02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:54.860]  kill you
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:06.460]  I was trying to think of the word epic life is epic the mystery of this planet
[02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:10.740]  and where we came from and everything around us it's epic the fact that men and
[02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:15.980]  women can come together and make a new creature and that humans can experience
[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:21.500]  life and love art and literature and all the passions and everything and then
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:25.580]  you see the metrics out there of people unhappy and thinking the world's empty
[02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:33.580]  and they don't care and fantasy football and dramas is is is what we think is the
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:49.020]  ultimate goal of the world watching other people pretend the engineering is
[02:18:49.020 --> 02:19:02.100]  so pervasive and it's not failed it's not it's it's it's by design and the
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:10.900]  failures of the system are designed because 98% of people who work in the
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:15.940]  system corporate government doesn't matter follow their own template that
[02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:18.660]  they've been basically programmed with and are compartmentalized and they
[02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:25.820]  don't even know how things are working so they have no hope and even if you try
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:36.620]  to convince them of what's going on it's so complex that's just unbelievable
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:43.020]  that's why I couldn't even continue the radio show was a week or two ago I mean
[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:50.340]  it's just if people really want this lie I mean from one in 25,000 having
[02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:53.940]  autism to 150 something I mean if you really wanted to kill you and you really

[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:10.860]  here's an example of why I'm not even frustrated I'm just waiting for the
[02:24:10.860 --> 02:24:16.700]  answer the key and I know there's not a silver bullet in this world but I know
[02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:20.580]  one key is being excited being passionate and letting people know that
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:27.060]  you're really concerned because I don't get excited on air as an act but we've
[02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:31.020]  got to imitate success and the fact that I from a grassroots position have been
[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:37.860]  the most successful in this planet's history of exposing the hidden global
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:42.940]  elites and combines right at the point when they are emerging because when they
[02:24:42.940 --> 02:24:47.100]  finally fully take over they have to emerge and so they're now announcing
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:52.960]  the secret torture the forced drugging the social engineering the illegal
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:58.340]  spying the funding of al-qaeda the government trafficking and narcotics
[02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:02.740]  major banks laundering hundreds of billions of dollars I mean all this
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:10.020]  stuff that I would get threats over I would have Terry Reid on who wrote
[02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:14.620]  compromised Clinton Bush in the CIA I mean he was there he saw the famous
[02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:18.300]  people at the airfield flying in the cocaine he was a trainer for pilots
[02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:21.700]  they were already pilots but training on how it was done I mean he was there and
[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:24.380]  he said this is cocaine
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:30.860]  that Google that compromised Clinton Bush in the CIA I want to show people that
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:33.500]  book I want to get him on I keep saying get him on and we're trying to find his
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:37.780]  number and then contacting people and I would get him on the show or other
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:41.260]  people and I mean I had famous whistleblowers on have him on all the time
[02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:48.540]  and I'd come walking out at my apartment and there'd be a car sitting there
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:54.500]  and a good guy walk over you know in a suit it'd be an FBI agent they'd say
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:59.500]  how you doing Alex better watch yourself and I'd be like who are you you look
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:04.980]  a fed and it's like have a nice day or I'd be in a target parking lot and there'd
[02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:08.900]  be you can tell like special forces guys you you're getting your car they walk
[02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:12.980]  over and go make you really tough buddy better watch your bleep and I'm like

[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:08.620]  or some of them you do and when you go look at who these geneticists are
[02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:16.060]  they're all eugenicists folks Dr. Pionk at UT the FBI actually did something
[02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:19.780]  good in that case I was reading his quotes and showed his UT website where
[02:40:19.780 --> 02:40:26.260]  he's talks about Lucifer and he's in a white robe and says he's a druid and
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:34.980]  he heads up a department at the time in biology who can make that up and he's
[02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:39.180]  saying soon the airborne Ebola will be released and we'll all be dead and he
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:42.780]  goes to England and everyone gets these awards and standing ovations so I said
[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:46.220]  this guy needs to be investigated that's the investigate and then the FBI did go
[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:53.260]  talk to him I don't know why I went off on that story oh yeah and then we started
[02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:57.700]  getting threatened and this woman was sending his threats and saying don't
[02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:02.220]  talk about about him and you know all this it was several of his graduate
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:06.300]  students two more women it was a little campaign and I went and looked up one
[02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:12.380]  of these women and it was her now as a microbiology doctor working at a facility
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:16.220]  and I looked up the grant and what work they were doing and it was all this
[02:41:16.220 --> 02:41:23.020]  recombinant RNA DNA splicing connected into weapons development and there she
[02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:31.180]  was in that white lab coat a doctor now and she sent us this letter going Dr.
[02:41:31.180 --> 02:41:37.460]  Pianca is actually not hardcore enough he believes only 90% should die who could
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:44.020]  disagree we're a disease that we're a cancer and that all humans must be killed
[02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:52.580]  I mean these are flaming cult members folks I'm not crazy they are they're

[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:35.980]  pit and they they the psychopaths I've had the top psychologist psychiatrist
[02:42:35.980 --> 02:42:40.260]  they say they're in these dark horrible worlds it's always associated with the
[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:44.180]  occult and they don't feel like they're alive until they're torturing someone
[02:42:44.180 --> 02:42:49.300]  and then they they torture the children until they quote use them up and they
[02:42:49.300 --> 02:42:54.300]  can't terrify them or or torture them anymore and then they finally chop them
[02:42:54.300 --> 02:43:02.180]  up and they love the smell of rotting meat I mean who are these people they're
[02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:08.300]  like an interdimensional plague of psychic parasites I don't know what it
[02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:13.100]  is but I'm telling you this these people have to be dealt with and in my
[02:43:13.100 --> 02:43:20.140]  spirit I absolutely not in a hateful way but in the way you a lance a boil want
[02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:25.140]  to go after them and they want us to do it violently because they think they
[02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:28.180]  can dumb that down and control that paradigm they don't want it to be a
[02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:33.780]  spiritual cultural change of awareness and just see these people and go whoa
[02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:39.860]  because we've been so long slowly indoctrinated into all this slowly put
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:48.180]  into all this and marinated in it so long that we've become super accepting
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:55.260]  of just over-the-top garbage I mean I didn't believe people when they told me
[02:43:55.260 --> 02:43:58.620]  that like half the BBC were pedophiles and they were taking kids the royal
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:01.900]  family and they were naming names and this Prime Minister would slit little
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:05.540]  girls' throats in his office and they put plastic down the floor and they'd go
[02:44:05.540 --> 02:44:09.660]  have sex with the dead kids here and they do this and then and then and I
[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:13.540]  would be like delay delay delay delay when people like David Ike was on like
[02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:16.980]  15 years ago naming names I was because you know I can't someone that's just
[02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:20.980]  outrageous to say you know that somebody's a pedophile bringing with the
[02:44:20.980 --> 02:44:26.340]  royals and then it all comes out they are I'd get on the break and tell David
[02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:30.300]  David I'm sorry do not name names you're saying this and then I think my god
[02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:36.420]  what else is he right about I mean it's just it's just so over-the-top man
[02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:42.820]  weirdo disc jockeys bringing little kids the royal family who can come up with
[02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:49.220]  stuff like this who are these people and why do we put up with them and then
[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:58.780]  there's the epic thought why me why am I on air fighting with these people where
[02:44:58.780 --> 02:45:05.700]  are the other men they're smarter better looking men than me who are more
[02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:12.580]  eloquent what's your problem oh well this is too much you see she says the
[02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:15.540]  argument of hey scale it down people might wake up if you give them little
[02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:19.180]  baby steps maybe that works with some people I found all that works is just
[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:25.900]  slapping somebody upside the head with the full title wave of evil or as much
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:30.220]  as you can war and just go hey you know this is going on in your gut and that's
[02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:32.940]  what people will buck up say I don't want to hear it that's crazy because deep
[02:45:32.940 --> 02:45:36.460]  down they know they've all got a spider sense they've all got a sixth sense
[02:45:36.460 --> 02:45:41.580]  they've all got a subconscious mind that knows all this stuff they've been
[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:44.780]  preparing people with subliminals I showed Comedy Central doing it to us
[02:45:44.780 --> 02:45:51.380]  today admitted subliminal they've been doing this to get people ready and I'm
[02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:55.780]  picking up on the overt subliminal the sub subliminal these are just terms I'm
[02:45:55.780 --> 02:46:01.340]  coming up with the different types of them and man I just don't want to wake
[02:46:01.340 --> 02:46:04.540]  up and they've nuked a bunch of cities I mean there's just no telling what these
[02:46:04.540 --> 02:46:10.060]  people do I mean I they're they're just so evil is what I'm telling you we're
[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:20.340]  all in grave danger and I've gone past getting chills and my hair standing up
[02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:26.740]  on top of these people now and it's gone past that now it's just it's not even I
[02:46:26.740 --> 02:46:32.100]  can't describe the emotion it's beyond being stunned it's just what it's like
[02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:35.900]  if they live where he rowdy Piper puts the glasses on and he goes it figures it
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:42.420]  be something like this he starts laughing because it's just so over the top
[02:46:42.420 --> 02:46:49.700]  it's just like what and and I've got it convinced and then all these people on
[02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:55.100]  Comedy Central seeing in all these things I mean they listen to the show they
[02:46:55.100 --> 02:46:59.220]  watch the show I don't think I've run into and I'm not bragging I'm seeing the
[02:46:59.220 --> 02:47:02.940]  effect we've had like sonar the penguin I don't think I've run into her met a
[02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:06.340]  major celebrity that it doesn't listen to the show almost all of them are
[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:10.220]  listeners think they like being left or right and on little controlled
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:14.220]  reservations and not being able to politically speak out
[02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:25.860]  so they're all intimidated won't speak out so it's this paradox where there's
[02:47:25.860 --> 02:47:34.100]  a huge amount of people that are awake and then there's people that aren't awake
[02:47:34.100 --> 02:47:39.060]  but other people that are awake most of them were scared to speak out and I
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:41.300]  think it's because they're all doing what I'm doing they're looking for the
[02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:44.260]  silver bullet they're looking for the lever they're looking for the way well
[02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:49.300]  it's already there it's inside us we have to make the fundamental decision to
[02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:55.380]  break with the establishment of the spiritual level and to break with these
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:59.700]  phony churches and to break with the Pharisees who've got giant lumber
[02:47:59.700 --> 02:48:04.380]  yards in their eyes while they tell us what to do from a holier than now
[02:48:04.380 --> 02:48:16.780]  lecturing Jezebelian spirit and we have to start really focusing on what are we
[02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:21.900]  doing every day to change our lives to do the right thing to stand up against
[02:48:21.900 --> 02:48:27.060]  corruption to reach out to people that are doing good to support each other
[02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:39.300]  because we're in a 21st century war and the nasty technocrats and the PR firms
[02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:49.220]  and the media horse the deceivers the decepticons that that are in these
[02:48:49.220 --> 02:48:53.420]  positions I mean you people all know you're helping bring in the fall of
[02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:58.460]  civilization you all know that you are destroying your family's future and most
[02:48:58.460 --> 02:49:03.020]  of us say yeah I do know that but I got to make as much money as I can now as
[02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:08.660]  we're maneuvered towards global collapse with two quadrillion derivatives
[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:13.180]  many times all the wealth of the world designed to bring us into a global
[02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:17.220]  collapse global depression and the answer will be a global standardized
[02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:23.780]  computerized world government with world IDs and world chips to buy and sell so
[02:49:23.780 --> 02:49:31.780]  that everything can be integrated into safe and fun and wonderful and then it's
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:35.980]  really about social compliance to medically make everybody take the so
[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:40.380]  called vaccines that are really just behavioral modifying nanotech now I
[02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:43.220]  mean that's what these design viruses are that they're not viruses they're
[02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:48.420]  they're completely artificial I mean it's so science fiction that like 15 years
[02:49:48.420 --> 02:49:51.500]  ago they had anti-stress vaccines they were testing and then now they give them
[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:55.620]  to the troops and they used to go commit suicide a month later and they give them
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:59.740]  a vaccine that viruses go and attack and eat areas of your brain associated
[02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:04.740]  with spiritual experiences and joy anguish the real center of humanity the
[02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:13.340]  real high points what it's all about the state I live in constantly and now Bill
[02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:15.580]  Gates says we're gonna put it the food we're gonna put it in the air we're gonna
[02:50:15.580 --> 02:50:18.900]  have nanobots just where you're gonna give you as that you can read the
[02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:24.980]  literature that's their end game folks the end of free will where you get one
[02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:28.500]  of these vaccines or it's in one of these GMO bananas with where pharmacological
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:34.100]  crops where it grows it in the banana you eat it you get sick for two days you
[02:50:34.100 --> 02:50:38.660]  get out of bed and you're just not a person anymore you just don't have it's
[02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:43.980]  like a lobotomy you just don't have that connection to your spirit anymore but
[02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:47.780]  let me tell you you can't get our spirit Bill Gates so even if you do that even
[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:52.580]  if you lobotomize me or anybody else as long as our spirits were lined up with
[02:50:52.580 --> 02:50:57.580]  God go straight there and out of your hands and that's the true salvation and
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:00.700]  that's the ultimate victory and you'll be with all your damn demons

[02:54:31.620 --> 02:54:40.860]  also the bad news always a paradox to a mouse we go ahead and read that quote
[02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:47.900]  Jonathan John Steinbeck of mice and men the best laid plans of mice and men
[02:54:47.900 --> 02:54:57.340]  often go awry you look at all these elitists throughout history that think
[02:54:57.340 --> 02:55:04.300]  they're invincible and then what do they do 20 plus million Russians died 20
[02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:08.340]  plus million Germans died in World War two only four hundred something thousand
[02:55:08.340 --> 02:55:19.820]  Americans that's still a huge loss think about that all because our government
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:24.540]  help put linen in power our government with the British help put Hitler in
[02:55:24.540 --> 02:55:27.380]  power that's that's all in mainline history books you don't really see it
[02:55:27.380 --> 02:55:33.020]  on discovery channel or history channel but it's it's there IBM completely
[02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:36.300]  backed even now they run killing our trips it just can't make this stuff up
[02:55:36.300 --> 02:55:42.900]  just just you just can't make this stuff up and there's just thousands of things
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:49.620]  it's just over the top and at a primitive level I don't like it I don't
[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:52.300]  like seeing humanity getting screwed over I don't like seeing bad people
[02:55:52.300 --> 02:55:56.700]  winning I don't like seeing this and then I realize it is animated by evil I
[02:55:56.700 --> 02:56:04.700]  mean there's there's something above it I don't care you're an agnostic Christian
[02:56:04.700 --> 02:56:12.620]  you better recognize that it's bad it's lowdown and all you people laughing and
[02:56:12.620 --> 02:56:18.460]  giggling like Gruber and and and and the stupid anchor Brian Williams all the
[02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:24.260]  rest of them don't you get there's a special place reserved in a tyranny
[02:56:24.260 --> 02:56:31.220]  not in hell oh that too there's a special place reserved now for people like
[02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:48.460]  you you think it's funny you think it's funny you're gonna find out the problem
[02:56:48.460 --> 02:56:57.420]  is I take no pleasure in knowing how you'll be judged I mean I think about
[02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:04.300]  how bad a person I am just for my thoughts and then and the way I am and
[02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:08.780]  everything and then I think about you people that don't even care and you
[02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:16.900]  think it's all cute you have been turned over completely to the God of this
[02:57:16.900 --> 02:57:26.580]  world and that's no God at all God is a builder and we were made in God's image
[02:57:26.580 --> 02:57:30.300]  to be builders and creators and we've done incredible things and I'm not gonna
[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:37.740]  sit here and hear a bunch of parasites telling us that we're crap not gonna do
[02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:44.340]  it and it is the belief that human life is precious and the human life is
[02:57:44.340 --> 02:57:49.660]  amazing and the human life is made in the image of a master creator even if you
[02:57:49.660 --> 02:57:52.940]  idiot atheists don't believe that have you seen the spaceships and all this
[02:57:52.940 --> 02:57:58.900]  stuff we're on a planet I mean we're pretty darn cool if we try to be
[02:57:58.900 --> 02:58:05.660]  honorable if we honor innovation and and and and and a fair shake what I'm
