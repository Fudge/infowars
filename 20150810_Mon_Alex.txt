[00:00.000 --> 00:14.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.720 --> 00:28.080]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones
[00:28.080 --> 00:35.440]  here back in the saddle Austin Texas now won't be leaving till about a week and a half from now
[00:35.440 --> 00:41.200]  I'll only miss one show then I'm going to Canada to speak with George Norrie up there in Toronto
[00:41.840 --> 00:47.200]  two Saturdays from now but I'm gonna be hanging around the command base pretty much exclusively
[00:47.200 --> 00:53.120]  here and hosting six days a week Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and then of course
[00:53.120 --> 01:01.280]  back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. all times central there's a lot of big news happening in this world a lot
[01:01.280 --> 01:06.560]  of incredible things happening we're going to cover it all after this quick break but at the
[01:06.560 --> 01:11.840]  center of it not just here in the United States but in other countries I witnessed this in Europe
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.720]  all you hear about is Donald Trump is this planet Donald Trump I think he's a paradox
[01:18.720 --> 01:25.760]  I haven't made my mind about Donald Trump but here's John Bounds take on it right now
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.640]  America remember when a young upstart Illinois senator Barack Obama promised everything under
[01:32.640 --> 01:39.680]  the sun Obama promised to cut the deficit in half well it was 10 trillion then it's over 18 trillion
[01:39.680 --> 01:46.000]  now Obama promised shovel ready American jobs but as Obama's golf games increased and he spent
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.000]  millions of taxpayer dollars on his vacations he ignored his jobs council eventually disbanding it
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.520]  and now we have an economy with more than one third of the country on welfare not to mention an
[01:57.520 --> 02:03.280]  emboldened surveillance state militarized constitution despising police a middle class
[02:03.280 --> 02:09.600]  destroying health care program wide open borders huge foreign policy failures in the Middle East
[02:09.600 --> 02:15.920]  Europe and South America an impending corporate world government courtesy of the TPP and a nation
[02:15.920 --> 02:24.240]  increasingly divided on race basically everything Obama promised was a big fat lie his biggest
[02:24.240 --> 02:30.320]  achievement appears to be the ability to lead the American people along like lemmings nature and her
[02:30.320 --> 02:43.120]  infinite wisdom has spared a few back on the acting plane there remains the small handful that did not make this fatal journey so who's the globalest strawman this time around could it be
[02:43.120 --> 02:48.640]  Donald Trump the Washington Post reported that former president bill clinton had a private telephone
[02:48.640 --> 02:54.240]  conversation in late spring with Donald Trump at the same time that the billionaire investor in reality
[02:54.240 --> 03:00.400]  television star was nearing a decision to run for the white house according to associates of both men
[03:00.400 --> 03:05.840]  four trump allies and one clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that clinton encouraged
[03:05.840 --> 03:12.560]  trumps efforts to play a larger role in the republican party and offered his own views of the political landscape
[03:12.560 --> 03:18.640]  donald trump is a longtime friend of the clinton's so what would the strategy look like in order for
[03:18.640 --> 03:24.320]  trump to buttress hillary's presidential campaign as she struggles with the shackles of her latest
[03:24.320 --> 03:30.160]  debacle of an fbi email investigation where at least four of the emails on her private server were
[03:30.160 --> 03:37.280]  found to be classified first delay the democratic presidential debate done we won't see a democratic
[03:37.280 --> 03:42.560]  presidential debate for over two months and the handful of democratic candidates are already
[03:42.560 --> 03:48.720]  complaining that the schedule of six primary debates are designed to allow hillary to shine
[03:48.720 --> 03:55.280]  second send in the donald to stir up the republican campaign test the waters by using promises and
[03:55.280 --> 04:01.200]  observations about america that hillary can utilize later in her campaign if it weren't for me
[04:02.080 --> 04:07.280]  you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration chris you wouldn't even be talking
[04:07.280 --> 04:15.600]  about this was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until i brought it up at my announcement
[04:15.600 --> 04:21.760]  and i said mexico is sending and once trump is dominated and weakened the republican field with
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.200]  his faux populism trump can jump right off the republican bandwagon and run as a third party
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.520]  candidate further watering down republican votes which is something trump has already hinted at
[04:33.520 --> 04:38.880]  here we are again debate when the candidates actually talk about the criminal conspiracy
[04:38.880 --> 04:44.880]  that has devoured our government and transformed it into a corporation masquerading as a democracy
[04:44.880 --> 04:51.200]  not to be mentioned again once they're in office as this brief season of populism and reflection
[04:51.200 --> 04:58.560]  of american values morphs into a reign of tyranny john bound for enforce dot com we'll be back stay
[04:58.560 --> 05:06.320]  with us did you know that only six corporations control 90 percent of what millions of americans
[05:06.320 --> 05:13.440]  see here and read every single day it's the illusion of choice think about it the mainstream media is
[05:13.440 --> 05:20.320]  owned by only a handful of mega corporations with vested interests but on the other hand the internet
[05:20.320 --> 05:27.040]  is an interconnected network of billions of sources so you can research information for yourself
[05:27.040 --> 05:33.520]  from multiple sources or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media
[05:33.520 --> 05:39.680]  never questioning what you're being told this gives you a false sense of reality i mean do you
[05:39.680 --> 05:45.760]  actually know what you think you know or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version

[08:59.360 --> 09:05.840]  at day but night while i've been out of the country for two weeks that i have returned
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.800]  we of course were reporting live from the road great job rob do who accompanied me for the full
[09:10.800 --> 09:16.640]  two weeks buckley hammon flew in because there was so much news to cover for the last week and took
[09:16.640 --> 09:24.320]  his wife along with him so it was a great trip got a lot done and we shot basically enough material
[09:24.320 --> 09:30.320]  for three micro documentaries that i think are going to have a big effect talked to a vatican
[09:30.320 --> 09:39.040]  insider who predicted three years ago on tv radio and in print that they would put basically pop
[09:39.040 --> 09:45.760]  francis in as a jesuit which is unprecedented we got the rest of the inside scoop we've got
[09:46.320 --> 09:51.920]  just a lot of amazing interviews all hd that'll be highly produced and powerful
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.240]  that we're going to be airing over the next month on the nightly news and on this radio
[09:56.240 --> 10:03.280]  slash tv transmission but we are back thank you so much for joining us i will get into donald trump
[10:04.480 --> 10:11.680]  all things donald this is planet donald and i don't normally go with whatever the big
[10:11.680 --> 10:18.000]  distraction du jour is i didn't cover the malaysian airline situation now of course they think they
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.320]  found it i had a few guests on i mentioned it when new developments came out but compared to
[10:24.320 --> 10:30.560]  other media mainstream media alternative media we covered it probably one one hundredth of what
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.240]  they did because that was a pure distraction what does it matter at the end of the day it's a sad
[10:36.240 --> 10:40.560]  tragedy but compared to what's happening the rest of the world it is a diversion that's why the
[10:40.560 --> 10:46.480]  media was running with it at nauseam but with something like donald trump it's different
[10:46.480 --> 10:53.440]  because it's about the 2016 election the future of this country and the rest of the world and
[10:53.440 --> 11:01.040]  whether he's a shill whether he is for real uh regardless of who donald trump really is
[11:02.160 --> 11:08.800]  the study example of how the media is handling this how they're spinning it how people are
[11:08.800 --> 11:18.560]  responding tells you a lot and and i'll say this if donald trump flip-flops or if he obviously falls
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.560]  on his sword or drops the ball on purpose or lowers his fist during the twelfth round
[11:25.760 --> 11:31.120]  he will be anathema and hated in this country and there will be no
[11:31.120 --> 11:40.880]  no resuscitation for him with the body politic that said though if he's a shill
[11:43.360 --> 11:48.720]  he may not have a choice and is being blackmailed because i'll tell you when you own casinos and
[11:48.720 --> 11:53.120]  you're involved financing both political parties and you're tied in with the folks that the donald's
[11:53.120 --> 11:59.040]  tied into uh they couldn't die to him sandwich in this country you've seen him go after
[11:59.040 --> 12:06.080]  her mark cuban and others for simply you know criticizing tyranny and indicting him for
[12:06.080 --> 12:10.720]  stock market stuff that was clearly not illegal you see him indicting the texas attorney general
[12:10.720 --> 12:16.720]  for a crooked toenail basically while hillary again gets money from third world dictators
[12:18.160 --> 12:22.160]  at her foundation when she's the head of the state department to then sell them arms
[12:22.160 --> 12:28.400]  unprecedented stuff they get away with so there's a lot going on here and we're going to be covering
[12:28.400 --> 12:32.800]  donald trump quite a bit today we don't have any guests because i want to be able to cover news
[12:32.800 --> 12:38.240]  get to a lot of special reports and clips and analysis and of course take your phone calls
[12:38.240 --> 12:43.680]  but i do want to open the phones up in the first hour into the second hour on really what do you
[12:43.680 --> 12:51.600]  think about donald trump i mean with pope frances we know he's a leftist socialist who wants carbon
[12:51.600 --> 12:58.560]  taxes and global government and is coming to congress to lecture the the vatican says here's a p
[12:58.560 --> 13:06.960]  boop and boop the pope and congress frances is certain to challenge lawmakers so we're going to
[13:06.960 --> 13:15.200]  have a international religious leader here meddling domestically in our politics telling us what to
[13:15.200 --> 13:22.320]  do it is unprecedented you've got the irs harassing hundreds of thousands of christians
[13:22.320 --> 13:28.160]  thousands of churches libertarian conservative groups pro-gun groups auditing them taking away
[13:28.160 --> 13:34.400]  their 501c3 saying don't be politically involved when the first amendment expressly says government
[13:34.400 --> 13:41.120]  has no jurisdiction over religion and then the pope's going to come here and lecture us on carbon
[13:41.120 --> 13:48.160]  taxes and the rest of it it is simply outrageous i'll tell you one thing after being gone two weeks
[13:50.240 --> 13:55.040]  and not being under bright lights it is torturous
[13:59.280 --> 14:02.320]  you know we may have to get a lighting expert in here where we can turn
[14:02.960 --> 14:06.960]  up the irises and turn down the lights because i realized that it just kills
[14:06.960 --> 14:12.160]  my thinking process to be in here underneath these lights this bright i mean i'll have to
[14:12.160 --> 14:16.240]  get used to it but don't wonder i get such a bad mood every day by the third hour uh because it's
[14:16.240 --> 14:21.360]  like being interrogated but but i'm i digress ladies and gentlemen it is teleprompter free slash
[14:21.360 --> 14:29.120]  radio slash tv so we will be going over donald trump the good the bad the ugly what is he
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.400]  planning with the election john bound's report that we aired at the start of the transmission
[14:34.400 --> 14:39.920]  it's up on info wars dot com is donald trump a wolf of sheep's clothing shows the washington post
[14:39.920 --> 14:46.720]  and others admitting a year ago that donald trump was in conversations and consultations with his
[14:46.720 --> 14:52.560]  quote good friends the clintons about should he run as a republican something bill clinton encouraged
[14:52.560 --> 15:01.200]  him to do zero hedges asked the same question is trump the democrat wolf in g.o.p clothing
[15:01.200 --> 15:08.480]  well i know the clinton's loving but see they know that we're so desperate to hear somebody tell
[15:08.480 --> 15:15.520]  the truth about political correctness or anchor babies or open borders or nafta or gat or scores
[15:15.520 --> 15:22.240]  of other issues that we want straight talk we're starving for it we're like a man or woman in the
[15:22.240 --> 15:29.280]  sahara dying of thirst and so we hear the truth and we want to support it we want to defend it i do as
[15:29.280 --> 15:40.240]  well but the only way to defeat a moral strong popular opposition to oppression to despotism
[15:40.960 --> 15:47.520]  to social engineering to tyranny is to lead the opposition but one thing's for sure we're going
[15:47.520 --> 15:54.800]  to find out about donald trump and as i said earlier if donald trump betrays the american people
[15:54.800 --> 16:02.720]  and drops out of the race when he's in the lead like ross perot did or something else this country
[16:02.720 --> 16:09.440]  is a lot different than it was in 1992 1993 and he's going to face serious repercussions
[16:09.440 --> 16:13.920]  the only question is are those repercussions going to be greater than the possible black male
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.080]  that he's under that if he doesn't play ball they're going to indict him
[16:18.080 --> 16:27.840]  and believe me donald trump is certainly in a position where they can dig something up on him
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.560]  because as i've said i'm not even saying he's corrupt the way the laws are written in this
[16:32.560 --> 16:37.360]  country they can indict anybody they want whenever they want so that's all coming up but but while
[16:37.360 --> 16:42.080]  we're busy focused on donald trump here's just a smattering of the headlines here
[16:42.080 --> 16:49.600]  Lois Lerner emails released she exclaimed in emails lincoln should have let the south go
[16:49.600 --> 16:56.720]  and talks about how texas is her enemy and i've told you there's this weird fantasy land that
[16:56.720 --> 17:01.920]  they're lincoln and they're going to destroy the south and texas is the main enemy and
[17:01.920 --> 17:08.080]  we all ride horses to work and hate big government and her bitter clingers and the average texan i've
[17:08.080 --> 17:13.920]  been all over the country many times is just as sophisticated as anybody in san francisco or new
[17:13.920 --> 17:20.800]  york city in fact in my experience are more sophisticated when you get into management level
[17:20.800 --> 17:26.560]  stuff that's why so many multinational corporations are based here uh but there's just some weird
[17:27.120 --> 17:33.920]  fiction stereotype that we've all got outhouses and again i mean i mean when i'm in europe people
[17:33.920 --> 17:43.040]  ask me do you ride a horse to work uh no we just have uh out of the top ten cities what is it six
[17:43.040 --> 17:50.480]  of the top ten i mean nasa's based here i don't know what you what you're talking about but but
[17:50.480 --> 17:57.680]  it's all this bizarre obsession with destroying texas defeating texas bringing down texas because
[17:57.680 --> 18:03.040]  they hate anybody they think is macho and tough they want to break your will they want to make
[18:03.040 --> 18:10.080]  you submit and go i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm racist i'm sorry for saying all lives matter i'm bad
[18:11.040 --> 18:16.160]  and and and so there's this archetypal image in the globalist who want to conquer america
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.880]  that if they can just bring down texas why they've got the whole thing going
[18:22.960 --> 18:26.480]  when i've gotten around leftist in other countries other cities they hear texas
[18:26.480 --> 18:33.760]  and they recoil like they have encountered the devil or something uh it's just just distorted
[18:33.760 --> 18:38.960]  ignorant weirdos and you gotta remember their supporters want to put gun owners in forced
[18:38.960 --> 18:44.240]  labor camps and want to ban the first amendment and and every other bizarre thing you can imagine
[18:44.240 --> 18:51.040]  because they're a cult of dumb control freaks and so they've got these strawmen enemies
[18:51.040 --> 18:58.480]  i mean they go watch movies like machete where don johnson's a sheriff and is shooting
[18:58.480 --> 19:04.800]  pregnant hispanic women in the belly there's not one documented case of anything like that
[19:06.720 --> 19:11.280]  there's a fiction that everybody's down there shooting illegals no it's the coyotes and the
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.640]  and the mexican police that are burying those mass graves there's a documentary out on it that just
[19:16.640 --> 19:25.600]  won sundance that goes overall of it shot in mexico it's just it's just the war on reality
[19:25.600 --> 19:31.120]  okay i just read one headline here's some of the others republican led senate refuses to defund
[19:31.120 --> 19:40.960]  plant parenthood us defense intelligence agency had it was a willful decision by america to support
[19:40.960 --> 19:46.560]  an insurgency that had salafist al qaeda and the muslim brotherhood in it oregon state police

[24:51.680 --> 24:58.240]  that into the situation that we've been seeing more more research on that fungus is causing a lot
[24:58.240 --> 25:08.080]  of forms of cancer we know it's killing a lot of the bats so i'll cover that some in the second hour
[25:09.280 --> 25:15.200]  we're going to get into tensions flaring and fergusson on police shooting anniversary
[25:16.400 --> 25:23.760]  i'm tempted to send our reporters back up there but one of mr brown's friends who was one of the
[25:23.760 --> 25:31.360]  witnesses testifying to everybody else said wasn't true got shot reportedly after shooting at police
[25:32.560 --> 25:38.480]  and things are degenerating fast and everyone but hillary is having black lives matter come
[25:39.200 --> 25:45.680]  and shut down their campaign events so the soros group is doing a good job
[25:46.240 --> 25:52.640]  turning americans against each other and then making legitimate protest against police brutality
[25:52.640 --> 25:59.840]  looks stupid so i'll be getting into that as well but i want to take your calls on the trump
[25:59.840 --> 26:04.880]  situation starting in the next segment i've got some clips from the debates also have
[26:06.080 --> 26:08.880]  senator paul saying he's a fake conservative
[26:12.560 --> 26:18.560]  which if you judge donald trump by most of his past activities that's true he's been pro abortion
[26:18.560 --> 26:25.920]  he's been pro immigration but he says of workers which i agree with of their skilled workers we need
[26:25.920 --> 26:32.960]  them uh and he's been a huge democrat supporter more than a republican supporter that said he
[26:32.960 --> 26:39.040]  has been a critic of vaccines for more than a decade and linked it to autism and said he
[26:39.040 --> 26:47.760]  doesn't take vaccines something i like about trump and i think trump has to be given the
[26:47.760 --> 26:55.280]  benefit of the doubt if senator paul who i'm a big supporter of was as aggressive and hardcore as trump
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.440]  and wasn't listening to his advisors from the republican party that have successfully
[27:03.440 --> 27:08.000]  gelded castrated the republican party he would be way out front
[27:10.800 --> 27:15.360]  now there's no doubt we showed the article earlier that trump has had multiple phone
[27:15.360 --> 27:20.240]  conversations with the clinton's about whether he should run for officer or not in the clinton's
[27:20.240 --> 27:23.680]  bill clinton specifically said please do it as a republican
[27:26.640 --> 27:29.200]  we're talking about running the most important country in the world that
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.920]  is the lynch pin of the global empire would they engage in this type of operation to take
[27:35.920 --> 27:43.200]  control the republican field and scuttle it absolutely but trump could really want to be
[27:43.200 --> 27:47.760]  president and want the power for himself there's such a thing as divide and conquer but there's
[27:47.760 --> 27:55.280]  also a thing called separation of powers where because the elite themselves are divided and
[27:55.280 --> 28:02.000]  fighting over power a lot of times historically they end up not being able to finish their plans
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.920]  that's why we have a divide and conquer over government the founders use that against government
[28:07.920 --> 28:14.320]  itself we want gridlock so we don't get a man on a white horse that they just found one of the
[28:14.320 --> 28:20.480]  headlines from the washington post about the clinton's and trump uh basically war gaming things
[28:22.880 --> 28:24.960]  so i'm going to give trump
[28:28.960 --> 28:33.200]  i'm going to give trump the benefit of the doubt
[28:33.200 --> 28:40.560]  because what he's saying against political correctness against open borders is common sense
[28:40.560 --> 28:45.440]  it's not racist and if they can demonize that idea then they can demonize
[28:47.600 --> 28:54.880]  the truth and he talks about having enthusiasm cutting taxes by 40 percent things like that
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.080]  would create one of the biggest booms this country's ever seen
[28:58.080 --> 29:02.160]  and i hope people like donald trump are real
[29:07.760 --> 29:11.520]  but i want to get your take on the situation here's the toll free number 800
[29:11.520 --> 29:22.000]  259 92 31 800 259 92 31 but i just want to say this right now i said it twice i'll say it again
[29:22.000 --> 29:30.640]  today for the third time if donald trump engages in any hanky panky or any double dealing i don't
[29:30.640 --> 29:39.280]  care how slick he is and how many fancy east coast degrees he's got and how many casinos he owns
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.520]  at this key juncture he does this he is he's going to be dirt in this country he's going to
[29:45.520 --> 29:51.840]  emulate himself politically burn himself the ground we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:52.720 --> 29:55.600]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[32:58.720 --> 33:15.760]  live from the infowars.com studios it's alex jones
[33:15.760 --> 33:36.640]  this morning i was in another county working on a very important story that i'm not at liberty to
[33:36.640 --> 33:49.680]  report on yet and was approached by a gentleman who's actually well known in intelligence agencies
[33:51.840 --> 33:56.640]  and who also had working under him
[33:56.640 --> 34:07.200]  a famous intelligence operative just wanted to give me his card and get in contact with me
[34:07.200 --> 34:13.120]  while i was working on a separate story my life is like a james bond movie i'm not bragging i was
[34:13.120 --> 34:18.320]  just remembering i had this card and that that strange happening took place in a parking lot
[34:18.320 --> 34:27.280]  and then separately we were contacted by one of the most famous astronauts ever
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.960]  and it's not buzz aldrin has been on the show it's not some of the other people it's it's um
[34:33.840 --> 34:40.720]  a very famous astronaut from the old space program and the newer space program i'll leave it at that
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.760]  and let's just say this i've entered the twilight so
[34:53.600 --> 35:00.800]  there i was flying back from rome yesterday on a dreamliner
[35:04.960 --> 35:09.040]  and the windows have chemicals at them where you can lighten them or darken them and i
[35:09.040 --> 35:14.000]  want to have this beautiful blue when they're dark and then you can hit the button and
[35:14.640 --> 35:20.800]  lighten it and i was up at 33 000 feet looking at the curvature of the earth up in the edge of
[35:20.800 --> 35:29.920]  the earth's atmosphere and just thinking about how fantastical reality is by the way that
[35:29.920 --> 35:34.400]  astronaut's coming on tomorrow did i mention that they want to come on
[35:34.400 --> 35:42.720]  and i was just thinking as i've said many times i want to say it again we will break free from the
[35:42.720 --> 35:51.760]  globalist tyranny the minute we get outside their control box and just realize that we're in a world
[35:51.760 --> 36:08.000]  of wonder that we are residents of wonder world and i was down in san marcus this morning
[36:12.160 --> 36:14.880]  and after i pulled out of this parking lot from doing an investigation
[36:15.840 --> 36:20.560]  and i was driving down the road and i looked up on the name of the street i'm not kidding
[36:20.560 --> 36:30.320]  and it was wonder world street and i'd just been thinking last night on the plane that i was going
[36:30.320 --> 36:41.040]  to shoot a special report called wonder world and then i'm down there on another story and a guy
[36:41.040 --> 36:51.600]  from iran contra pops out the parking lot and then i get here and they're like yeah this astronaut
[36:51.600 --> 36:59.040]  contacted us he wants to come on and talk about something big but i'd want to talk about it till
[36:59.040 --> 37:07.120]  he's on the show and it just gets weirder and weirder and weirder by the moment but i guess when
[37:07.120 --> 37:18.320]  you open up to the universe and open up like the mind of a child the universe opens up to you
[37:20.720 --> 37:26.080]  and the globalist the social engineers the controllers of the public mind they know this
[37:26.080 --> 37:33.440]  and everything they do is to shudder the mind so that you don't realize how truly amazing things are
[37:33.440 --> 37:38.880]  i want to go to mike john john rick ben and many others the toll free number to join us
[37:38.880 --> 37:46.720]  is 800 259 92 31 we're going to be talking about donald trump in the 2016 election
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.640]  and what do you do when somebody is saying things that are true saying things nobody else will say
[37:55.360 --> 37:59.440]  you got to defend him because you got to defend those ideas but then he's hanging out with the
[37:59.440 --> 38:09.040]  clintons he's giving them money we've seen this before and you know you got good candidates like
[38:09.040 --> 38:19.680]  rand paul and ted cruise so i got to say at a gut level rand paul i trust 99 percent
[38:19.680 --> 38:30.960]  10 cruise 95 percent donald trump about 49 but in my gut i feel like i've just got to give him
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.080]  the benefit of the doubt because i believe if he gets enough support he will force the other
[38:36.080 --> 38:41.360]  republicans to become more populist and more nationalist i mean that is the good news that
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.240]  he is bringing up the topics they don't want discussed he's bringing up the vaccines the open
[38:46.240 --> 38:54.720]  borders the devalued dollar he says he doesn't want war with putin and maybe just maybe donald
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.680]  trump really wants to be somebody not just some casino owner and some real estate owner
[39:01.280 --> 39:04.160]  because at the end of the day folks if you got a bunch of money and a bunch of power
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.600]  so i talked to a lot of people forbs is way down the list trump is way down the list on the forbs
[39:11.600 --> 39:17.200]  list i've talked to folks with more money than donald trump and they say it's completely empty
[39:19.680 --> 39:26.000]  you'd think it's completely fulfilling that's why they all try to get into politics or influence
[39:26.000 --> 39:33.680]  things whether it's for good or bad and and maybe just maybe donald trump's figure that out now
[39:33.680 --> 39:40.960]  and not when he's 85 years old and get ready to die like a lot of them do because i'll tell you
[39:40.960 --> 39:46.800]  right now at 41 years about to be 42 at 41 years old i'm the same as i was when i was 18
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.960]  i've always cared about what's honorable and it's not because i'm some great good wonderful
[39:52.960 --> 40:02.880]  perfect person on a proverbial platform high horse i instinctively know people come and go
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.000]  i've got a connection everybody before me and everybody coming up in the future i want humanity
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.800]  to be successful i want us to survive i want us to thrive i'm a fan of humanity i believe in innovation
[40:18.560 --> 40:22.880]  and i don't want to devalue human life because if we devalue human life we'll devalue everything
[40:22.880 --> 40:30.560]  else as well so what do you think about donald trump and then of course i'm just going to say
[40:30.560 --> 40:36.560]  this every day because now is the season that folks actually care i've made films about it i've
[40:36.560 --> 40:43.360]  written books about it i've covered it for 20 years this is something i was informed of when i
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.440]  first got on air all the times you'll hear me say i've covered it for 15 or i've covered it for 18
[40:47.440 --> 40:51.760]  or i've covered it for 10 i've learned a lot in the process of everyday focusing on what's
[40:51.760 --> 40:57.360]  happening in the world and talking to all these experts and all these guests and reading your
[40:57.360 --> 41:03.760]  letters and books and the information you send in and your phone calls i've been focused on this
[41:03.760 --> 41:10.640]  but on the subject of them harvesting babies and implanting their brains and mice and pigs and
[41:10.640 --> 41:16.720]  cows and splicing them with spiders and jellyfish and you name it
[41:20.000 --> 41:26.000]  i've known about that since day one because it's in scientific publications that they were cloning
[41:26.000 --> 41:33.040]  human embryos 50 years ago probably earlier they've been splicing humans with everything under the
[41:33.040 --> 41:41.920]  sun so they don't have rights then they grow these humanoids up in these laboratories inside
[41:41.920 --> 41:50.080]  not artificial wombs but inside cows and inside pigs and now they've reportedly got artificial
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.440]  wombs where they are growing them in and there's stocks trading on this stuff and i should hear
[41:55.440 --> 41:59.680]  talking to the public like a bunch of kids and i'm telling them the Atlantic Ocean exists
[41:59.680 --> 42:06.480]  you're like really show me the Atlantic Ocean and just because you deny the Atlantic Ocean
[42:06.480 --> 42:11.040]  exists doesn't mean it's not there and it's it's key and i keep saying this every day i'll say it
[42:11.040 --> 42:18.240]  again and then go to your calls if the public understands that they're selling baby parts and
[42:18.240 --> 42:24.480]  keeping babies alive to harvest their organs and in planting their brains in mice yes they're giving
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.840]  mice human brains that was out 20 years ago they're putting human brains in roaches too
[42:31.680 --> 42:37.520]  they use rats they use mice they use roaches they're hooking brains up to computer chips i mean
[42:37.520 --> 42:40.720]  it is you name it they're doing it and that's what we know about
[42:43.680 --> 42:48.160]  how do you get the public to understand that's only the tip of the iceberg
[42:48.160 --> 42:54.000]  it's admitted the geoengineering
[42:56.400 --> 43:00.720]  i turned my phone off i was sleeping part of the way on the way back i woke up
[43:03.040 --> 43:09.520]  we're flying it over canada over the pole from europe and i see a jet flying about
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.400]  you rarely see this at 33,000 35,000 feet maybe flying
[43:14.400 --> 43:21.280]  two thousand yards away i mean it's close big flying the other direction
[43:24.880 --> 43:30.000]  and it had ice crystals forming behind it and by the time i fumbled and turned my phone on
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.600]  because we're flying on the same path just the other direction they were gone i was watching
[43:35.600 --> 43:43.760]  the ice crystals disappear in front of me as we flew by the jet a they were forming at high
[43:43.760 --> 43:51.280]  altitudes like they're supposed to be it was dissipating within 30 seconds that's the condensation
[43:51.280 --> 43:57.680]  trail we all grew up with and see there's an example when you're awake
[44:00.640 --> 44:04.320]  everything is incredible because you see the propaganda you see the manipulation
[44:04.320 --> 44:07.600]  you see the mysteries you wonder what else is going on and what am i getting it
[44:07.600 --> 44:14.400]  it's manhattan projects in top of manhattan projects it's a manhattan project with the human
[44:14.400 --> 44:22.640]  cloning they've kept quasi-secret it's a manhattan project squared with the chem trailing the geoengineering
[44:23.520 --> 44:28.240]  which is admittedly going on but again all the specifics are classified and it's like
[44:28.240 --> 44:33.120]  what are they doing underground bases clones spraying stuff in the atmosphere
[44:33.120 --> 44:40.640]  uh uh boarding half the black people uh and i can't get white people black people nobody
[44:40.640 --> 44:45.920]  i'm like they're killing half of you i'm sorry some cop shot one of you and you're making it a
[44:45.920 --> 44:50.160]  big deal george soros is telling you to focus on this
[44:53.120 --> 44:58.480]  because it's divide and conquer the mainstream media is pushing it can't we come together and say
[44:58.480 --> 45:04.640]  what are you spraying what are you doing to the crops what are you feeding us there's over a thousand
[45:04.640 --> 45:12.800]  crops in the us of corn that are pharmacological crops over a thousand approved i'll give you one
[45:12.800 --> 45:17.040]  example they got them that grow hepatitis they got them that grow hiv
[45:19.920 --> 45:23.440]  i'll never forget i was on a coast to coast am show one of their weekend hosts
[45:23.440 --> 45:32.960]  i don't get the name wrong ian punnett i think that was his name pretty nice guy
[45:32.960 --> 45:37.920]  it's like 10 years ago mort and he goes give me an example of pharmacological crops so i pulled
[45:37.920 --> 45:44.320]  up in front of me ap a couple years old in protogen live hiv corn planted in texas that grows
[45:44.880 --> 45:52.560]  hiv for us experimental hiv uh vaccine and he said there's no way they have corn that grows hiv
[45:52.560 --> 45:58.560]  and then he looked it up and he goes oh my god it's true and see i said i'd go to your calls and
[45:58.560 --> 46:07.200]  i will but but but that's an example of just we're not in kansas anymore it's worse than we know
[46:07.200 --> 46:13.600]  it's always always always always people excuse me of exaggerating man i wish that was true it's
[46:13.600 --> 46:25.040]  almost always worse than i thought and all i know is
[46:28.960 --> 46:33.600]  i get contacted by a lot of high-level government people over the years generals astronauts
[46:35.520 --> 46:41.200]  kernels famous people you hear some of them on the air cia whistleblowers foreign government
[46:41.200 --> 46:46.080]  leaders of head of the german intelligence agency andres funbulo uh the number three in
[46:46.080 --> 46:54.800]  the japanese government's been on i'm not bragging i'm telling you why is this show so special
[46:54.800 --> 47:00.400]  this is not rocket science this is all admitted and it's just the fact that i and our audience and
[47:00.400 --> 47:09.280]  our guests care and other people don't they really think the movies and sex and beer is everything
[47:09.280 --> 47:14.240]  or football games and look i'm not saying movies sex and beer or something bad it's just at the end
[47:14.240 --> 47:26.000]  of the day there's bigger things on this planet our species just started flying with airplanes
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.320]  a hundred years ago with hot air balloons 500 years ago the helicopter was invented 80 something
[47:34.320 --> 47:42.400]  years ago we've now got spaces spaces we've now got the dna cracked of humans and we're not being
[47:42.400 --> 47:48.400]  given access to it we're told sit down and shut up while they're cloning humans crossed with animals
[47:51.760 --> 47:55.040]  and they got the nerve to come out and say first planned parenthood does not
[47:55.520 --> 48:02.080]  sell body parts okay we do but uh we don't make money okay those are edited videos so they release
[48:02.080 --> 48:06.880]  five hour ten hour three hour videos they're all out there five hour almost put out today it's on
[48:06.880 --> 48:15.600]  info wars with what they're doing and so as interesting as donald trump is it's all a facade
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.440]  and by facade donald trump's playing along with it most these people are compartmentalized
[48:23.360 --> 48:28.480]  it's the scientific technological elite that eisenhower talked about that's in control
[48:28.480 --> 48:34.400]  of the military industrial complex that's running this whole operation and as far as i'm concerned
[48:34.400 --> 48:41.200]  they're space aliens and again i want to be clear i'm not saying they are literal green men from mars
[48:41.200 --> 48:49.440]  or from pluto or from the moon or from you know arctic bases or whatever the globalist are a guild
[48:49.440 --> 48:54.720]  of psychopaths super genius control freaks who say in their own literature they believe they're
[48:54.720 --> 49:01.280]  another species and envision discovering dna 160 something years ago and guess what they've done it
[49:02.560 --> 49:08.480]  so i give it to them they have built a breakaway civilization what we know is so fantastic i can't
[49:08.480 --> 49:15.520]  even imagine what they're really up to and they're already creating aliens on this planet that's a
[49:15.520 --> 49:21.120]  hundred percent fact when you cross a human with a pig or a human with a spider or a goat with a
[49:21.120 --> 49:29.200]  spider or a human with a cow you have created something alien that did not exist and was not
[49:29.200 --> 49:39.920]  of this world you're now playing god and when you start harvesting organs and doing all that you've
[49:39.920 --> 49:43.520]  now dehumanize yourself i'm gonna go to break come right back with your calls we'll do donald trump
[49:43.520 --> 49:47.280]  right through the next hour and i'll get to all this other news the mystery fungus is killing
[49:47.280 --> 49:52.400]  things and the rest of it that's what i'm really worried about is what you see in the movie interstellar
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.160]  which is what the globalists actually talk about is the type of bioweapon you'd release would be
[49:56.160 --> 50:01.040]  like a super fungus that eats all the nitrogen out of the atmosphere or stuff like that it's only
[50:01.040 --> 50:07.440]  a matter of time i mean they're setting up a world-ending event as best i can tell i'm gonna
[50:07.440 --> 50:13.600]  skip this network break to game more time i'm gonna stop after that super mill vitality is back
[50:13.600 --> 50:19.760]  you help funder operation with these high quality plant extract concentrates and the reason super

[51:40.560 --> 51:45.040]  the way they're supposed to all these chemicals in the food and water are on record what else

[53:10.240 --> 53:18.000]  cart site and this is a revolution in funding we're not selling you know a dvd for 100 bucks
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.200]  like pbs does to get you to donate or a $50 donation for a coffee cup that cost them a dollar
[53:23.200 --> 53:28.000]  and then they get tax payer money on top of it i'm not bashing local pbs i think they do some good
[53:28.000 --> 53:34.000]  sometimes compared to npr that's the devil in my view but this is a hardcore operation that tells
[53:34.000 --> 53:39.120]  it like it is and we're about 70 self-funded now still have some sponsorship we could have
[53:39.120 --> 53:44.480]  all the sponsorship we want but this way i can have total control over quality in house the
[53:44.480 --> 53:48.560]  network has their sponsors and that's their issue but we have ours they have a lot of great
[53:48.560 --> 53:52.960]  sponsors as well but when you hear a certify something that means i've checked into it i
[53:52.960 --> 53:59.280]  believe in it and it's the very best product for the lowest price possible because i don't believe
[53:59.280 --> 54:05.200]  in reap what you show i know it's real there's difference between believing and absolutely
[54:05.200 --> 54:12.080]  at a cellular level living that way you can call it superstition but it's it's beyond superstition
[54:12.080 --> 54:18.400]  my cells want to help people my gut wants to help people my gut wants to help myself
[54:18.960 --> 54:21.200]  when i hurt somebody it's like i'm doing it to myself
[54:23.200 --> 54:28.080]  that's why people that are vandalizing the genetic code of this planet people playing god
[54:28.080 --> 54:34.560]  the devilish miscreants make me at a cellular level hate their guts okay donald trump
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.680]  trump the political hurricane still rages on but he's up in poll numbers in a new scientific poll
[54:41.680 --> 54:47.440]  drugreport.com is linked to the nbc news survey showing trump went up after more
[54:47.440 --> 54:51.840]  incendiary comments yeah people are sick of political correctness and being bullied
[54:52.880 --> 54:56.880]  and the system knows that's what they always say be nice don't be incendiary don't be aggressive
[54:56.880 --> 55:02.240]  in politics you'll get ahead and then they can select the most milk toast wimp they want that
[55:02.240 --> 55:08.320]  they can destroy whenever they want i mean i'm not saying i like what tiger woods did i'm not
[55:08.320 --> 55:12.800]  defending it but if he to come out and said it's my private life and my wife wants to leave me
[55:12.800 --> 55:19.200]  that's her issue um you know it's probably not the best what i've done i apologize to my family
[55:19.200 --> 55:24.640]  but it's none of your business this is nothing compared to robin manks or or or politicians
[55:24.640 --> 55:31.600]  screwing us over stay out of your you know business that isn't yours tiger woods would have
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.560]  been just fine instead he bought into all the hype and what the media was saying about him and
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.200]  everybody turned on him for hundreds of apologies oh they said you better apologize and then when he
[55:41.200 --> 55:47.680]  did they destroyed him well now they want donald trump to apologize talking about
[55:47.680 --> 55:51.920]  meghan kelly bleeding out of you know her her eyes or whatever well that's what he said about other
[55:51.920 --> 55:57.600]  people and again i'm not even defending trump when they build a straw man whether he's good or
[55:57.600 --> 56:05.600]  bad and then destroy him they're destroying us and they're destroying free speech but rand paul
[56:05.600 --> 56:14.400]  says trump is a fake conservative and i want to play that clip right now this is him on the news
[56:14.400 --> 56:18.960]  talking about the donald and saying he's a fake conservative and i think his track record shows
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.680]  he's not really fake it's that he wasn't a conservative previously here it is well i don't
[56:25.680 --> 56:32.240]  think we should reward vulgarity and i don't think vulgarity equates with insight and so because
[56:32.240 --> 56:37.600]  you can shout and call people names and call someone stupid or call someone fat is that really
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.000]  what we're gonna make the decision on for who's going to be our nominee you know i came out of
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.200]  the tea party movement and part of the tea party movement was that we were upset with fake conservatives
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.480]  and republicans who truly weren't conservative republicans who were for obama care and republicans
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.280]  who were for the bank bailouts well that's that's donald trump he's been for all of these liberal
[56:57.280 --> 57:03.600]  policies and now because he can stand up and say vulgar things and he's a truth teller well the truth
[57:03.600 --> 57:08.720]  is what is he for i have no idea whether he's conservative he really could be a liberal for
[57:08.720 --> 57:13.440]  all i'm concerned i have no idea what his real philosophy is other than that he is for promoting
[57:13.440 --> 57:20.880]  himself overall i think that's true i think it's fair for rand paul to get tough and say that if
[57:20.880 --> 57:28.160]  he wants to win but rand is listening to the republican wing uh that's telling him to not
[57:28.160 --> 57:34.800]  go after the open borders and he's kind of been down the middle on this issue he's voted against
[57:34.800 --> 57:40.640]  amnesty but only because it wasn't transparent it's not libertarian to bring any legals and
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.880]  then give them everything free yes we could have open borders if we didn't have any welfare
[57:44.880 --> 57:51.360]  so rand stop listing your advisors at more like donald trump i don't think it's vulgar
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.600]  to say oh i defeated him in a debate they were bleeding all over the place i use that analogy
[57:57.600 --> 58:04.800]  all the time in a debate i was beating the snot out of him he was bleeding he was melting down
[58:07.200 --> 58:13.520]  i mean i swattered pierce Morgan absolutely mop the floor with him that's why they that's why
[58:13.520 --> 58:17.840]  they declared it such a defeat for me because it was such a devastating victory that's why
[58:17.840 --> 58:22.320]  they wouldn't dare invite me on anything got top ratings number one new story in the country for a

[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:09.280]  national populism metaphysically he's now in that office and he better not screw people over
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.480]  he better not back down he better not now flip-flop and throw it to hillary who he'd always been
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.840]  meeting with what's your take on this whole situation what do you see coming what do you
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:26.320]  see unfolding mike in arizona thanks for holding you're on the air worldwide okay i was glad to
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:33.600]  have you back welcome um just wanted to say i'm glad to hear you say that you want to give uh
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.720]  trump the benefit of the doubt i feel the same i want to give him the benefit of the doubt i was
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:45.120]  at the rally he had here a few weeks ago and you know there were 15 000 people there lots of patriots
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:52.560]  lots of info wars fans and uh you know like on the on the issues of him you know used to be for
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.600]  abortion whatnot you know just like yourself like you said you've been involved in him in the past
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.320]  like myself i used to believe in it but thought it was about women's rights but you know you come
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.200]  along on those issues once you start learning more and more about it well sure and it'd be specific
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.520]  i wasn't paying for him i wasn't involved in that sense other than the fact that i knew it was going
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:20.080]  on and didn't do enough to stop it uh and in a way that's a coward's way it's almost more cowardly
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:27.440]  what i did kind of blind dying it than in their pushing for it so let me be clear uh it was very
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:35.840]  cowardly and and and and and and bad and not good for my family name uh and low uh the way i was when
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:41.120]  i was say 18 20 years old and i repent of that so when i criticize folks out there that have had
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.280]  abortions i'm not doing it because i hate them individually i'm doing it to warn them now the
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.880]  people that know what it's really about and are pushing it and covering up and and uh covering
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.240]  up what it's really all about they are the scum of the earth go ahead sorry no i'm
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.640]  feeling the same way i mean when we were younger for myself personally i i thought it was really
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.960]  about women's rights you know women were being held down but you learn you know what's going
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.320]  about margaret sanger and and eugenics that these this isn't it and that feminism was actually hijacked
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:15.120]  by the rockefellers because only half people were being taxed you know to break up the family
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.840]  they all admit it they all written the books on it in fact it was women's suffrage was hijacked
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:26.080]  but yes they turned into modern feminism well i think he might have come along on those issues
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.200]  and like myself in the 90s i used to be a democrat when but you know you learn more
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.560]  and you come along on issues and what what big businessman doesn't want to buy power and influence
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:42.400]  so you know well it's our political system and it's legal right now so i think saying that he's
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:50.720]  given campaign contributions to both sides isn't overall a completely honest uh attack
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.360]  because they're playing on the ignorance of the public not knowing that major corporations
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.560]  always have to give to both sides whether it's the Koch brothers or you name it my problem is
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:08.240]  he's hooked in with casinos very seedy he is also hangs out with the clinton's previously plays golf
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:16.160]  with him uh and uh ran it by bill clinton should he run for president as a republican and bill clinton
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.640]  said i think that's a great idea donald so you add that together i'm just saying let's watch him
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.160]  let's see what he's doing he's meant to be put in there by the clinton's i'm not saying he's
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.920]  consciously doing this to tear the republican party apart not that the republican party is
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.920]  perfect it's certainly bad but it's meant to obscure the good movement within the republican party
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:46.160]  good to hear from you mike let's talk to john rick ben and many others straight ahead on the other

[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.960]  group that secretly experimented on people by making them breathe diesel exhaust and the group
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.880]  that is finding people all over the country for the amount of smoke that leaves their chimneys
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.760]  spilt an estimated one million gallons of hazardous wastewater into the animus river
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.680]  according to the epa the spill occurred when one of its teams was using heavy equipment to enter
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.160]  the gold king mine the suspended mine near dorango instead of entering the mine and beginning the
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.880]  process of pumping and treating the contaminated water inside his plan the team accidentally
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.800]  caused it to flow into the nearby animus river officials said they believe the spill carried
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:37.200]  heavy metals mainly iron zinc and copper from the mine into the creek that feeds into the animus
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.840]  river you can see pictures all over the internet of orange water throughout the river and local
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.200]  residents are concerned that fish and plants near the river are going to be dying en masse the epa
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.760]  also wants to cut out coal power burning plants which provide cheap power for the united states

[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:06.960]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:18.400]  war on for your mind
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.720]  all right i've been pontificating for an hour on donald trump and other issues
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:37.760]  and yes he's a distraction but he's a distraction that's become real he is dominating in the polls
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:43.040]  a new nbc poll that's up on drudge report dot com is out and it shows what other polls show
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:49.440]  since the debates he went up even higher the more the mainstream media attacks him the more the people
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:55.680]  supporting including a lot of democrats and that's what i told politico about four years ago when
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.800]  ran paul got into the senate they called up and they said yeah well you know why can't we bring
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:07.200]  down ran paul and i said because you're discredited and i said if you start endorsing him that will
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:14.960]  bring him down but you're so arrogant you won't do that and so that's how discredited congress is
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:22.240]  with an eight percent approval rating that's how discredited establishment dinosaur media is
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:29.120]  and now we have this cult of personality that hangs out with the clinton's who gets bill clinton's
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:35.760]  blessing the washington post reports last year to get ready to run for the republican nomination
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.280]  and i don't know if ross perot was a show or not i know he dropped out when he was
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.080]  five points ahead of george h.w. bush and bill clinton he was about five points ahead of each one
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:55.600]  of them some showed 10 points ahead and then he said my family has been threatened i am stepping down
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.800]  now warns you about naft and get i told you everything was going to happen and i'm done
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:11.760]  i'm retiring goodbye so what is going to happen if that unfolds that is a big question what are you
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:19.760]  going to do when donald trump flip-flops and see the media will be attacking him on legitimate
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:26.560]  issues on things he said that are truthful like we shouldn't pay for anchor babies we shouldn't
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.520]  have open borders uh we should make america strong again we should cut taxes so you'll
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.720]  want to defend him because what he's saying is legitimate now i'm giving him the benefit of
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:44.000]  the doubt and i'm not just doing that because mainline libertarians and conservatives overwhelmingly
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:53.600]  like him i'm doing it because he's not really run for office before he's done some good things 10
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:11:00.240]  years ago speaking out against vaccines speaking out against uh so-called free trade speaking out
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:09.200]  against a lot of things and tell them the truth so i'm not sure i'm thinking maybe he really does
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.640]  want to save this country maybe he wants to really be the big man and not just a real estate casino
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:24.320]  owner i don't know but regardless he's the front runner and people out there that love him aren't
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.880]  going to listen to us if we just say oh he's horrible oh he's a shell oh he's a government agent
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.360]  they're only going to listen to us if we're legitimate say okay we'll give them another
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.200]  the doubt but let's all watch out and let's all appreciate ran paul who's talked about the nsa
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.360]  spying and funding al-qaeda and isis and talked about all these other issues who's being attacked
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:55.600]  and demonized because they know he's the real deal notice he didn't support the tpp ted cruise did
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.040]  people like rick perrier for forced garter cell inoculations can't support him
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:11.600]  800-259-9231 then we're going to go into the control room studio and talk to joe jennings
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.640]  anthony guttiarty uh and others and get their take on the situation but now let's go through
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.640]  your calls here pretty quick john and wyoming you're on the air go ahead welcome back alex thank
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:29.440]  you brother i want to do uh give you a suggestion if you get a chance to interview donald trump
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:38.240]  or ted cruise or ran paul asking this one question which will determine whose side they're on ask them
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:46.000]  if you are elected president do you promise now you will never appoint any past or present
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.480]  member of the cfr to any cabinet level position or any judgeship anywhere in the country and if
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:13:01.280]  they won't answer yes to that then they're on the other side it's really that clear cut and simple
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.320]  well sure i've never criticized the catholic church because a lot of catholics i know are great
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.880]  people and i saw the catholic church being against abortion what do you do when the pope
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:18.000]  is endorsing socialism and endorsing communism endorsing open borders involved in our internal
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.880]  politics pushing carbon taxes calling for planetary regimes what do you do how do you respond to that
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:30.880]  well it's hard to do because i believe and there are a few other people who believe this too that
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:38.240]  this is the anti pope this is the man who was sent by the devil to destroy the catholic church i was
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:44.320]  in the catholic church for over 20 years and i got out when all of this stuff long before this
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:51.680]  pope frances came about i got out whenever we had a priest down in dickinson texas trying to
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:59.520]  tell us he was talking about the schism which occurred in 1054 ad and then he said well and
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:05.360]  since that time many a greek orthodox priest has led millions of their parishioners into hell
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.360]  so he was implying basically that if you're not a member of his church you're going to hell which
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:21.040]  is an obvious lie because jesus decides where we go not some idiot priest but what i think here we
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.600]  need to ask these people whether it's donald trump or rand paul or ted cruise if you are elected
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:34.800]  president will you promise right now you will never appoint any past or present members of the cfr
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.840]  to any cabinet post or to any judgeship you know that's a great idea we should get a coalition
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:49.360]  or group together and just ask trump to sign a pledge to try to repeal nafta and gat to not
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.320]  have members of the council on farm relations or trilateral commission basically we should ask
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:04.080]  trump to sign on to the texas republican campaign platform because if you look at the republican
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:09.760]  platform of texas voted by the republican party it sounds like something the john birch society
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.360]  wrote and i think that's the answer is to get him to pledge on a new contract on america that he
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:22.640]  will actually stand on and sign his name to and then if that happens he'll be in a lot of trouble
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:27.520]  what do you think's going to happen to trump though if he scuttles the this republican opposition
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.640]  to the clinton's what do you think's going to happen to trump's name i mean i think he realizes
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:41.440]  that uh the his name is going to be anathema well what i'm worried about is if he is the nominee
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.600]  that they're going to arrange for a convenient little accident for him as they did for jfk back
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:55.520]  on november 22nd 1963 that's the way they work remember when e howard hunt was about to be paid
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:03.200]  all kinds of hush money over the jfk assassination his wife went to pick up the money it was over
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:09.360]  what two million dollars worth and as she was flying back home while the plane was flying over
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:16.080]  it was a commercial airliner flying over southern illinois it mysteriously blew up in the sky scattering
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:22.000]  a couple of million dollars worth of currency all over the landscape people forget about that god
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.840]  bless you great call from john i'm going to go to rick in a moment but we forget the globalist
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:35.920]  to keep power didn't just kill jfk or didn't just kill other people they blew up a whole bunch of
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:41.360]  aircraft they killed a lot of house members a lot of senators a lot of governors now they just indict
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:47.920]  you and so we're entering a very very serious time right now let's go to rick in missouri
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:55.680]  listening on kcxl 11 40 a.m you're on the air rick thanks for calling in hey welcome back alex
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.520]  how you doing today buddy good brother thanks for calling what's your take on trumpy well listen uh
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.640]  i'm i'm just i just wanted to make a quick comment regarding uh trump and uh ron paul
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.760]  and stuff and then i'll hang up so other people can uh you know have more air time uh on your
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:18.400]  great skill but listen now what do you think of the uh uh tag team between like trump and ron paul's
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:24.640]  first president vice president or then vice versa i think it'd be a one two punch that this united
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.280]  states have never seen that would be a great ticket and and we've had presidential candidates
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:35.360]  attack each other before uh and then end up being on the same ticket but i tell you uh i don't see
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:40.400]  that happening because trump's the type that would want a weak second to him kind of like george
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.440]  herbert walker bush had dan quail that would be a great ticket because i think people would trust
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.880]  that ticket and ran paul has a lot of appeal to more sensible liberals that are anti-war
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.000]  anti-foreign aid but uh that would be a great ticket what do you think's going to happen to
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.880]  trump though if he scuttles this election uh it's it's good all right it's going to run the name
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.080]  i'll tell you it's that's not a good deal he needs to stand his ground and be truthful to the american
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:15.040]  people i hear you and with all the dishonesty we've seen from politicians and all the corruption
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:22.640]  and all the dirty tricks and all the hanky panky and shenanigans i i hear criticism from folks
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.600]  against people that don't trust trump and i i don't think that's legitimate i'm not saying people are
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:34.080]  bad who think trump is the second coming and and just are staking everything on him
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:42.160]  but i don't think you're bad either if you don't trust it i'm sitting back i'm watching
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:46.800]  we're going to go to break here in a moment uh but first i want to go to anthony gusciardi
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.560]  for a moment come back with him and then to joe jennings and then back to your calls but i wanted
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:58.320]  to as we go to break anthony what's your gut level feel on trump you know i watch the republican
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.760]  debates i usually don't there's a reason this one got 24 million viewers it's because people
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:11.280]  are tired of the i will be a strong leader they want no pc no bs and that's what trump brings
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.160]  regardless of what he ultimately does people think it's a brush of fresh fresh air when
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:20.160]  meghan kelly asked him that question about some things he said about rosy o donald and
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.360]  tried to corner him in with his liberal perspective of you said something bad about a woman he said
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.600]  yeah who cares you know i'll say the same thing about a man if they're coming up against me
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.000]  and people love that stay there i want to come back and have you elaborate on that but that's it i
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.040]  mean look a woman's on tv she's a political anchor she's in a man's world she's a politically

[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.160]  i'm talking to my crew and political uh and of course health writer anthony gucciardi we got
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:45.920]  joe jennings uh who again helps uh run the show and joe's got his political view on the situation
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:50.160]  as well i mean i'm really just trying to hear from people out there about what they think about
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:55.440]  donald trump and if he just joined us he doesn't be hiding in the caves and i know he's leading
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:01.280]  the republicans the more insinuary he gets the higher he goes in polls that just validates everything
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.960]  i've been telling people stop being apologetic stop being cowardly i'm not saying our listeners
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:13.360]  have been but to the general public stop apologizing for everything i've got a video coming up the next
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:23.360]  hour of black racist demonstrators in southeast texas where this black lady i think killed herself
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.800]  in the cell she talked about suicide said she was going to commit suicide flips out when the cop
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:37.440]  pulls her over they might have killed her say 10 chance cops do that sometimes they're bad cops
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.320]  and then these black racists show up that sound as bad or worse than any white racist i've ever heard
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.120]  and there's these white people going i'm sorry i'm white i have black friends i'm sorry that shut
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:55.040]  up white you're need to die period all whites are bad i mean this is the craziness being put up
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:01.440]  that the mainstream media helps exacerbate there it is sandra bland protest all white people
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:09.440]  should be killed bright bark texas and this woman is so emboldened and arrogant because
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.160]  of political correctness in fact i want to get that lady on the show if we can do it she does
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:20.400]  cuss a lot because i'm going to sell her okay can we not abort the black babies or can we
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:27.840]  shut up racist because see that's not the script being fed by al sharpton in the media
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:37.840]  it's just totally totally crazy but i digress to the dumbing down of society before we go back to
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.720]  your calls uh anthony finishing up your points uh on trump uh look this guy's a playboy he's a
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:51.520]  party animal my big concern is i think he's black maleable big time uh he's involved the casino
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.840]  business that's as dirty a business as they come um i don't have a good gut feeling about trump
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.960]  overall him specifically i don't have a bad gut feeling but the whole process just feels like a
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:11.360]  setup but at the same time you gotta defend him because what he's saying is true so so how do
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:17.360]  you separate that dichotomy from what he's saying is true so they're attacking what he's saying you
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:24.480]  gotta defend it because what he's saying is true but at the same time i've got some concerns what's
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.600]  your take on that i think it's interesting to know that all of these pundits and everything say oh
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.800]  well he's breaking the rules of politics he's unprofessional he's not a true politician well
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.800]  those are rules that they set at some point in time and those are rules that people actually
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.680]  hate and as i mentioned you know 24 million viewers on the debate the most viewed non-sports
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.720]  event on cable ever fox news should be worshiping trump for doing so at the same time it's like
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.240]  yes he is black maleable yes also it's a cost-benefit analysis is the hillary campaign can actually
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.560]  pay him off more money to uh side with them but he's going and being real and that's what people
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.680]  like people like so that's the messages people want genuine even if he's not really genuine
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:12.000]  the appearance of genuine is king yeah exactly and he's going on air and megan kelly obviously
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.400]  the uh host who was from fox news hosting the debate was throwing these super super
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:22.240]  challenging questions that i'm trying to hit him with pc crap like oh you hate women you know
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.640]  how could you say this about these immigrants and everything like that and he's not cowering
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.440]  and playing by the political ballgame and saying i'm so sorry i'd never meant to say that then
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.840]  he would lose ratings would drop instantly so they could try and blackmail him with some stuff
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:41.520]  but if he's smart which it appears he is he plays it off as hey i don't care i'm real we all say
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:47.200]  things you know what's mattering the real issue is that this country is in the toilet that's
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:53.840]  right and they've done the debate down so much that again i saw an article in info or a few days
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:29:01.680]  ago where at major universities they're having slap a straight white mail day and it actually
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.840]  says go out and slap straight white males i mean it's total discrimination it's total
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:15.120]  bizarro cult like heavens gate weirdo behavior and then we just sit here with these totalitarians
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.960]  going slap a straight white male today well go ahead and slap me i'm going to break your
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.680]  nose go ahead then it would be a hate crime though all i did was come up and slap him
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.520]  because he's a white male and he knocked my teeth out i mean it's it's just and it's all these
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:37.120]  chicken neck little white wimps that are leading the whole thing funded by george soros going to
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.720]  ferguson chaining deck the halls with dead cops and now reportedly one of these loons just shot
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:48.720]  at some cops so they got shot and that's called racism march the empires are in the middle of
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:55.360]  racism march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.680]  to pull it out of the rut that's just not what america's about well i mean napoleon helped
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.640]  oh yeah napoleon helpligore got him it was another guy that was pretty confident in germany
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:49.840]  yeah he did a good job pretty good on population control too well you talk about killing germans
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:59.360]  he got 20 million germans killed oh yeah i just i i can't believe what trump is saying i just can't
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:06.160]  believe that that would be a good choice for the country yeah okay screw everybody you know i'm
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:11.440]  donald trump and we're in the u.s and who cares i just don't think that's the way we should be going
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.520]  but we're being dominated by the bullies of political correctness don't you see though that
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.440]  i'm not disagreeing with you joe overall people's response is they want somebody
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:29.360]  to throw it back in the face of the establishment the problem is he comes out of that very establishment
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:37.200]  is a very slick salesman with a lot of charisma and so we have to debate his providence and if he's
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:43.600]  for real i think he could be for real i'm not saying he is i think he could actually want to
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.200]  be president actually want to save the country there have been a lot of leaders who were macho
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:55.520]  and arrogant who were not evil who were able to pull countries out of a rut by having confidence
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:00.720]  and giving people the perception of confidence uh the problem is a lot of times they turn into men
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:06.000]  on white horses like napoleon bonaparte that's where we get the saying he wrote a white horse
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.800]  so in comes in in rides the man on a white horse who do you think would be a worst president then
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:19.440]  since you don't like trump hillary clinton or donald trump it's just the the best of both evils
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:26.880]  there i mean i they're both corporate shills uh you know neither of them can be trusted that a
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.600]  lot of people say well you know hillary's got a track record she's been in government for 20 years
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:36.240]  yeah that's what we need yeah committing crimes more like 35 all right joe great points let's go
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:41.120]  finally to matt uh there in the control room studio he made a really good point during the
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:45.280]  break and wanted to come on air repeat the point you made because this is something i basically
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:52.000]  said but not as simply as you've said it because the way you crystallize it is absolutely on target
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.440]  and that's why the clintons are on record encouraging trump to run for the republican
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:04.800]  nomination uh go ahead and make your point on that hey there so name recognition in politics let's
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.080]  pretend here for a second say that when i'm voting i don't know anything about the policies or the
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:17.600]  legislature that um some of the politicians have gone for created voted for whatever so in that instance
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:23.520]  i would vote for the person who i'm most familiar with on the ballot it's name recognition that's
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.920]  a concept in politics and it does really dictate um a lot of polls and things like that um when
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.560]  people are polling this is a great example donald trump he's he's very popular now um
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:41.920]  um that could be uh the the correlation you're seeing there could be that he's just so recognizable
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:47.440]  everybody who's known who donald trump was uh for quite a long time before he announced that he was
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:52.000]  running for the election anything like that so he doesn't have to cover any ground there he's
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.520]  already well known and then let's say he just drops out of the race well then who's the next
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.960]  most well known person that's right he hogs all of the debate time to make sure it's all about
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:08.240]  trump all the time while destroying any name recognition for the other republicans who don't
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.120]  have anywhere near any of them what hillary clinton's got and then with the dumb down public
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:18.800]  you now ensure hillary clinton that's right that's why people don't trust trump is because if he
[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:24.720]  betrays and if he drops out or if he can be destroyed then it ensures hillary clinton is the
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.960]  next president of the united states which i'll be honest with people it's going to give us a lot
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.360]  more ratings i'm going to become a lot more successful if hillary clinton gets in than a
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:38.400]  republican gets in and people go halfway asleep but i don't want her to get in because she's so
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:44.160]  dangerous they'll complete the work of obama and then it's game over will never repeal obama care
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:49.520]  will never control the borders will never get out of any of this globalism and so i don't sit here
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:55.440]  engage my show off of what'll be better for ratings news corps is going to make hundreds of millions
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:02.480]  of dollars more a year under a hillary system and that's why rupert murdoch has given two to one
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:10.720]  to hillary's campaign i mean i mean news corps is behind hillary for a reason and so here i am
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.840]  convincing myself that trump's bad news people are desperate they want to see a man on a white
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.160]  horse they want to believe everything's okay what he's saying is true let me ask you this matt
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.720]  matt and then finish up any other points to cut you off what does your gut tell you about trump
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.120]  and what do you think's going to happen to trump if he drops out
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.480]  what does my gut tell me about donald trump no i mean what's your gut i mean you think he's a
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.800]  shell you think he's great i mean separate from the name recognition point that he is hogging all
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:46.080]  of that and the media even though they're attacking him knows that they don't have any credibility
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.720]  so the only way they can do it now is lend credibility to him by attacking him knowing
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:57.840]  he's their shell and now we're talking truly machiavelli yeah i'd have to say uh donald trump
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:03.200]  is awesome not necessarily a good way not necessarily in a bad way he just is uh a big
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:10.960]  personality um he like we've seen on info wars he's got some views uh that are great like towards
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:17.600]  vaccines but he's also got some other ideas that are controversial and uh he's
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:25.840]  crashing through and you just never know if he's gonna make good on those promises
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:33.840]  so he he's a lot of talk we'll see if he's uh all bite is he all bark or is he all bite we'll
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:39.040]  find out soon and and that's certainly true thank you matt we will find out time will tell
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:44.000]  and look i've said this hundreds of times focusing only on a presidential race is part
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.880]  of the problem we get 60 turnouts on average for presidential campaigns 25 maybe for congressional
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:59.520]  type stuff local even lower and they can argue is voting even real the point is participation
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:06.160]  is good so that real ideas get injected into the process in my view and you see both political
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:12.400]  parties circling the wagons demonizing the true tea party because they know that movement is
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:20.800]  anti-new world order anti-globalist so you see the kind of tea party-esque nationalistic
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:35.440]  candidate show up to eclipse rand paul and others it's just what i would expect out of a new world
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:39.600]  order you know i like jessie ventura not that i even agree with some of his politics but i know
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:47.760]  he's a good guy he's for real and if he ran for third party it would probably take democrat and
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:56.400]  republican votes away would probably equal itself out a donald trump running for third party wouldn't
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:03.760]  inject ideas like a ventura would it would take away from conservatives from libertarians with a
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:09.200]  cult following that would then get behind him and ensure hillary would win as well so see i mean
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.880]  this works on so many fronts if he drops out he hogs all the name recognition hillary wins if he
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:24.880]  runs third party unless he wins it puts hillary in any way you look at this from any angle unless
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:35.440]  he's for real and he stays in this guy delivers it to the clintons let's go to john and florida
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:42.400]  thanks for holding john we'll go to ben and others that are patiently holding hello yes sir go ahead
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.280]  oh okay hey thanks for taking my call alex thank you uh hey you know i got a totally
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:52.400]  different outlook on this than probably most people do that's what i'm looking for please
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:57.120]  don't call and agree with me if you think something else okay i want to hear it okay at first i got to
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:02.720]  tell you something that mccain is for and then i'll tie that into trump okay okay mccain just
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:10.960]  mccain just came out and he's for reinstating glass steagle now this is a globalist par excellence
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:20.320]  okay um glass steagle will bankrupt major money center banks overnight okay so this is this man's
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:28.800]  way of running for cover he's running for cover now man okay that's the way i see it okay this
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:36.000]  monetary system is done it's coming down i do this for a living i do have some knowledge of this
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:43.440]  now how does this tie into trump if you notice the language that trump is using your leaders are
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:53.120]  stupid your leaders are bad negotiators he is conditioning the american public for what is
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:44:02.080]  to come and then oh it's just that they're stupid okay no they're criminals okay they are paid for
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:11.120]  and bought criminals the majority of them are treasonous okay and they don't want to get lynched
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:18.960]  this is this to me is is to me there is not going to be any election to me from what from what i've
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:29.280]  seen alex this country is over when when you let the president uh light up the white house in
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:35.680]  gay colors look i got nothing against what people want to do and it shows the focus is is is
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.520]  heavensgate cult level where he goes to foreign countries that are under al-qaeda terrorist attack
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:46.960]  like kenyan says you need to have gays everywhere i mean it's like since when did america become
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:55.360]  nothing but confetti shooting out the president's rear end exactly and now tie that in tie that in
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:02.240]  with with how he's how he's you know just look at the coincidences here he talks about the border
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:08.320]  oh yeah yeah and then everybody's making fun of it and then some woman gets killed now you know what
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:17.440]  the news media could have buried that but they didn't because they're going along with it this is all
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:22.000]  part to me no i agree in fact it's funny you raised that because i'll see something that makes me
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  think oh my god he's bad for sure that i'll see something that goes oh well he might be okay
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.400]  because i'm just trying to really be open minded here and not just have my mind set on something
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:37.680]  but when i mean there's illegals every day uh you know that are here committing crimes arson
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:43.920]  rape murder and then it's only on the local news and then yeah that woman gets shot randomly on the
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:49.680]  pier and then seeing in led with it and i was like that's a gift to trump even though they're demonizing
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:56.640]  him they then hand him things uh i don't know it's it's it's it's let's shift gears though into the
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:02.480]  collapse the elite are running to the bunkers there's major military escalations that always
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.040]  are a prelude to economic collapse uh the chinese stock market's been plunging
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:16.400]  greases and crisis you've got 30 40 unemployment in most EU states so much is happening right now
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.720]  and you see all these pieces lining up the federal reserve boom many economists are saying is coming
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:28.960]  to an end i shoot a video report about total emergency alert elites headed you know to the
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:35.920]  bunkers and it gets millions of views people are really really resonating that something big is
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:41.600]  about to happen jerold solente says he believes stock market crash will happen this winter i don't
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.760]  know if it's going to happen then because they've suspended the rules of economics to a certain
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:54.400]  extent but undoubtedly the cascade of bubbles is coming to an end uh and absolutely uh trump
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.760]  almost talks like he's some foreign leader he's like your leaders are this your leaders are that
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:05.520]  your leaders are idiots and you're right no our leaders are compromised sold out to globalist
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.600]  and part of a plan to bring down the world economy and on its back introduce the new
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:15.200]  planetary government that's been admitted with the pope now calling for it so we've reached this
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:21.520]  epic point and maybe they're going to give us trump as a strong man during the collapse
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:28.320]  to then bring in fascism i mean let me tell you the tea party and conservatism and libertarianism
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:36.080]  is hyper sexy hyper popular hyper growing but it can easily be twisted into a form of fascism
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:42.800]  and just like the democrats are a cult of communist wannabes led by fascist i mean they
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:51.200]  are a drooling knuckle dragging cult uh that that that don't look anything like their predecessors
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:56.160]  that were very good on many points but the republicans during this dumbing down can flip
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:02.480]  and metastasize into something just as nasty and all i know is something big is about to happen
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:07.440]  get into the economic collapse from i mean you say you're you you you you work in these
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.640]  financial areas we have a lot of the top experts the world on but it's not just our experts
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:18.800]  now sure we were saying at first it's a lot of other experts say the day of reckoning is coming
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:25.280]  what do you think's really happening john well what i think is happening is is that is that you've
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:32.880]  reached complete debt saturation the only way the only way to introduce more money into the system
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.960]  is to create more debt well you can't service that debt because there isn't enough taxes to go around
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:45.680]  to service it so the so the bottom line is they knew when they created this system of debt-based
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:52.480]  money that it would eventually self-destruct and we're now at that point faster and faster and faster
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:49:00.160]  eventually it's going to blow apart they know this was going to happen okay and this is all part of
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.160]  bringing in and consolidating it even further and further and further think about it alex
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:16.720]  who here can actually pay more in taxes you cannot i can't i can't pay anymore i'm done man i have no
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:22.800]  more money to give these people okay but yet in order to support a debt-based money system
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:31.520]  you must garner taxes and one guy one guy put it this way he said look we should just go ahead
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:37.520]  and print the money because what is the purpose of all of this loaning we're never going to pay it
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.920]  back it's an infinite loan they have no intentions of ever paying any of this back you're right we've
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:50.000]  now reached the point of critical mass and the only question is what are we as individuals going to do
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.760]  to get ourselves ready but also educate people around us so when it goes belly up they know
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:02.400]  that the free market didn't do this select mega banks who were exempt from the taxes exempt from
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:08.160]  the regulations they set this up and on the back of this meltdown they want to bring in even more
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:13.520]  control now is the key time to be spreading the word so people understand what is about to hit the
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.920]  fan great points appreciate your call john we're going to go to break and come back with ben and
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:26.240]  and then walt james christian and many many others that are patiently holding this is a great
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.640]  discussion a lot of great callers this is exactly what i wanted to happen today was to see you can
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.600]  hear some of our really smart listeners bring up different angles and other facets to this
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:41.520]  and not just hear me babble i've got literally a couple hundred articles that are all very important
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.400]  we're going to start covering those in the third hour but interspersed with your phone calls because
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:51.360]  through donald trump and the media's response and everything is happening in the landscape

[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:31.040]  it's going to be an awakening and a rediscovery of the principles that make great nations
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:38.240]  and if you look at everything being pushed by the establishment that's stolen power and it's
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:44.480]  created a monopoly based on fiat debt based on federal reserve fraud based on derivatives
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:52.560]  counterfeiting it all stands at odds with transparency with prosperity with everything
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:57.920]  that makes sense and that is good we're just talking about mike huckabee surging in the polls
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.760]  in the debates coming from nowhere very well spoken says a lot of good things
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:11.520]  but i think in the words of cj back there he's just good to make he's just there to make the
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.400]  old folks feel good and think everything's gonna be okay i've watched his show it's like an episode
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:25.120]  of the statler brothers i tell you it's social engineering writ large people want to believe
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:31.200]  what they want to believe let's go back to your phone calls let's talk to ben in missouri you're
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:37.120]  on the air ben go ahead hey elix thanks for taking my call and uh thanks for all your great products
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:43.200]  i use almost all of them and i'm really happy with all of them um my whole thing is is i just
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:49.440]  don't understand how anybody can support this guy trump uh i mean he's he's fake he's obviously fake
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:55.760]  he's as real as the color smitty the calls up your show i mean he stands up there as this beacon
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:01.120]  of crony capitalism and throws it all in our face and says oh let me tell you something i took
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.000]  advantage of all of these deals and let me tell you i'm very proud of this i'm very proud of this
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:13.040]  and it's it's disgusting this guy is appealing to the public's goldfish-like attention span
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:18.640]  by saying all the right things and by being politically incorrect meanwhile ran paul has
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:23.520]  dropped off the face of the earth he's the one that everybody should be supporting just because
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:30.000]  he's saying all the right things the exact same way as obama did in 2008 is it really a fun thing
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.280]  to watch of course it is for somebody who has a nihilistic view of things and wants to just be
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:40.320]  entertained while the whole country burns yeah go ahead and vote for trump but uh
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:45.680]  you know i wonder what everybody's opinion of him is going to be as far as electability is
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:51.200]  when he takes jeb bush as his bp because it sure did seem like he really enjoyed standing next to
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:57.040]  him at the debate uh it's pretty much all i've got and uh thanks again for your products there buddy

[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:37.520]  for your support james in colorado you're up next go ahead hey what's up alex um
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:41.120]  patient consider getting the natural light in your studio i have fluorescent lighting in
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:47.280]  every single room in my house it's like my control basically um but as far as trump i don't know if i
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:53.520]  coined the term but uh the wolf and sheepdog's clothing i think is the good one because a lot
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:57.760]  of these people like george bush to push small government but then of course you're putting
[01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:03.120]  through the patriot act global government so it's kind of just party politics and i think
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:08.640]  gran paul should attack them really on two issues which is eminent domain the fact that he's kicked
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:13.840]  so many people off of their private property using the bureaucracy unfair regulations that he
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:19.200]  supports so he has complex politics not using free market ingenuity not really being a free
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:24.480]  market capitalist i think he's the anti-establishment candidate like bernie sanders just like hope
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:31.280]  francis going up against tellerie clinton uh but the more attention they give them uh by
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:36.080]  tell us stay there you're making some really good points james we are really fleshing out

[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:21.520]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:30.640]  donald trump is the big issue eclipsing hundreds of others we'll cover some of those issues he's
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:36.960]  been eclipsing but we're taking your calls right now james in colorado was wargaming out what he
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:42.720]  sees is going on with trump james finish your points then and please answer my question on this what's
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:47.680]  your view on trump himself do you think he's smoking his own propaganda or do you think he's
[02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:55.120]  consciously met with the clinton's or do you think he's for real i don't think he's for real um
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:02.640]  he did give a million dollars to clinton sported rom manuals uh senate campaign but another thing
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:07.920]  is his stance on edward snowden where he made the claim that he's a traitor that you know
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:11.920]  what do we used to do with the traitors we used to either execute them or put them in prison our
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.840]  country's a weaker you know i forgot about that we should get all these clips together of trump
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:20.480]  saying execute snowden and you know supporting hillary and all the rest of it not that i want
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:27.200]  to go after trump i just want to focus in on what he really stands for i mean again we want to
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:33.360]  support him is what he's saying now is so true but don't people get what you say versus what you do
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:40.800]  it's what you do that's important the whole thing is that um if you're saying snowden's a traitor
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:45.040]  you're basically saying evil but he has difficulties saying the establishment of evil is so they're
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:50.160]  incompetent and they're the war criminals but again he's a politician even if he hasn't held
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:55.200]  office the same way you know that's kind of a drastic example but you know the cia they would
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:02:01.360]  film generals do i think the kids blackmail them i mean it's still small politics regardless
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:06.720]  so who do you think donald trump is deep down
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:14.960]  well i agree with him on vaccines and i agree with what what are we saying but i think the
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:20.000]  establishment is using him as a way to basically ignore rand paul you know the more they attack him
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.720]  the larger he grows and i think he's for global government and would we have an older position
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:33.760]  no larger global structure i agree with you well what an informed involved audience we have
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.040]  again what should happen to trump politically
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:46.560]  you know he's being promised a lot if he is a shell to to to play the part of judice
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:52.640]  scariot against america because he knows what's going on he's a smart guy in four to five six
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:58.240]  years if we don't turn this around the country as we know it is gone it's not like we're merging
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:04.000]  into some organic world government based on free market and prosperity we're going into
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:10.480]  a world government that is top down directed anti-human anti-prosperity he could not be
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:16.880]  signing us on to something worse james that's my final question how do you think trump will
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:22.320]  show out if he does do it or will he break off into a third party to make sure hillary wins
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:26.080]  how do you think he'll show out and then what do you think will end up happening to him politically
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:34.480]  uh yeah it's hard to say i think that he'll attempt to run keres's vp will be uh maybe he is
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:39.040]  partially for real but you know what happened to reagan he got shot and they considered i think
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:44.720]  he didn't put in his vp and he didn't play ball so he could be real on some levels but at the end
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:50.720]  of the day it's like with bush you might support some small government measures and it might even
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:57.040]  be important you know abortion is important to people gun rights and uh but at the end of the
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:03.680]  day i mean if you're looking at illegal wars um and the police state i think they're much larger
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:09.200]  than none of that really matters all right thank you so much we're going to go to break and come
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:17.680]  back with uh walt julia christian rich and others the toll-free number to join us is 800 259 92 31

[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.360]  to take one call after the other so just have your point ready i'm not going to ask any questions

[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:36.480]  it doesn't really matter now because what he's saying is true so they can tear that down they
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:40.880]  can tear down the basic ideas of liberty so we have to defend what he's saying and point out
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:45.600]  he's telling the truth and hope he's for real but also understand he's given two to one to the
[02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:51.360]  clintons consulted them before he ran for president as a republican uh and you know gave money to
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:57.840]  rome manuals campaign and has been pro abortion has been anti gun but then he comes out and says
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:03.840]  all this stuff the other republicans won't say when they've got good track records some of them
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:12.320]  what's wrong with them why won't they do it because they're getting advised by some really bad people
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.680]  the republican party is uh are the people that gave us nafta and gat with the democrats
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:24.960]  they're the ones that gave us obama care i was talking to a pretty prominent democrat in texas
[02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.720]  a few weeks ago before i left europe and they were like oh i know the insurance companies
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:35.680]  wrote it oh alex the public will never figure it out i mean it's just what it is it's just
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:42.560]  this acceptance of an engineered economy a giant screw job meanwhile ferguson's blowing up again
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:49.280]  brown's buddy got shot reportedly every shot at cops i don't know what's true the government's so
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:54.960]  corrupt i just know george soros is funding the black lives matter movement taking over everybody
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:10:00.640]  that's in opposition to hillary sanders and others can't have an event now without it being taken
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:05.200]  over by these people but they don't do that to hillary because george soros runs these groups
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:11.360]  and i'm not saying birdie sanders is good it just shows hillary is the one
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:18.080]  and if you think the persecution against patriots has been bad under obama get ready with hillary
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:24.320]  let's go back to your phone calls walton michigan you're on the air thanks for calling
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.160]  hello alex hey buddy go ahead all right go buddy you got back from your trip from rome huh
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:36.320]  uh very interesting investigation we've got some documentaries coming out on it yeah well
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:42.240]  donald trump went to fortum jesuit university so that bill clinton went to georgetown jesuit
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.720]  university and the jesuit pope is calling for a new world order just like clinton does just like
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:54.800]  donald trump has paid lots of money to new world order candidates and jim bush is a fourth degree
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:11:01.360]  knight of columbus bowing to the pope of rome in rome it's online you go a couple of photographs
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:07.600]  of him doing that rome controls the united states the jesuit controls the Vatican from
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:13.200]  behind the scenes with the doppel nicolas the jesuit general with the president jesuit pope
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:18.880]  well i mean i'll say this uh there's different camps people think the mason's run at all or
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:23.520]  they think the pope runs at all or they think the jews run at all and i don't think it's catholics
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:29.280]  or jews or masons i think it's corrupt groups and organizations that are basically globally
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:37.600]  hijacking control of all the major organizations but you cannot deny that the main driving force
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:43.280]  worldwide for global government now outside of the central banks is the catholic church
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:50.560]  and it is a fact and it is biblical um i just wish that the opposition
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:59.920]  in two problems in the catholic church itself wasn't so deceptive and lying and bad uh i mean
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:04.080]  that's part of the problem is we're just a fallen world but but i appreciate your call what do you
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:11.680]  think about donald trump well i i think he's a shell i think he's he's being sent in there to
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:18.320]  destroy any true opposition to the the pope's control of our country and what religion are most
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:25.440]  to the monarchy europe alex the catholics well i mean i know that after the fall of
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:33.600]  roam and then the fall of bizantine um it empires well that that was the government
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:38.320]  and i know that uh nevada can push for the creation of the e u but it's exempt from it itself
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:45.200]  so i hear you i appreciate your call i mean look we've never had a pope address the congress
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:54.480]  and again from what i've researched there's been a coup of the catholic church using sex crimes
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:59.040]  they're being blackmailed whether they were good before or bad before or a mix whatever
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:04.400]  it i mean it's even mainstream news that it's being blackmailed to do the betting of the globalist
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:10.720]  so regardless it's globalist run now and i mean here it is in ap pope and congress francis is
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:18.080]  certain to challenge lawmakers we're gonna have some religious leader in congress from a foreign
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:28.160]  sovereign city on the banks of the tiber lecturing us and calling for open borders and all this is
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:37.920]  just crazy and that shows how weak america is i mean we shouldn't have the head buddhist leader
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.920]  or the head jewish leader or the you know the or the head protestant leader billy graham address
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:50.480]  congress we have a separation of church and state and that doesn't mean you can't have your
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:55.760]  religious views in a public institution you can say a prayer at commencement you can have a bible
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:03.360]  at school the state has no jurisdiction in that we don't have state-run religion i mean this is
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:08.960]  unprecedented all of this is unprecedented all of it said i want to take a bunch of calls this
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:14.720]  is one caller is all i got to there uh christian and texas you're on the air than julia
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:25.040]  hello yes go ahead oh yeah i think we're taking my call um i'm 14 years old but i've been listening
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:31.600]  to your show for about two years but uh i told my parents and some friends that i said you know
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:37.920]  i'm not old enough to vote but you know you know people who are 18 older adults have this and they
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:43.680]  can vote and it affects them whatever you know what happened in this country affects them and
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:52.640]  affects you know us the youth but you know about donald trump i just uh you know he seems good
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:58.800]  what he's talking about and he seemed to you know he seems like he's would make a great president but
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:04.960]  i just have the feeling that if he does become president that he's going to be just like obama
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:08.320]  you know he went out there and said oh i'm not going to take your shot i'm not going to take
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:15.360]  your uh handguns and i could take your semiautos but look what he's trying to do i hear you and
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.640]  god bless you christian uh as a 14 year old listening for two years what perspective has
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:28.160]  this broadcast given you um it's it's really it's really opened up my eyes and just see what's going
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:34.160]  on i mean i used to you know i didn't care care for the news but i figured out that you know all
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:42.880]  this stuff it it affects us and that um you know and today's in school is me going to school i mean
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:48.480]  i realized that they're pretty much brainwashing us and the stuff that they say it's it's ridiculous
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:53.440]  well it's outrageous badmouthing the constitution badmouthing the institution of marriage now they're
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:58.480]  saying marriage is bad because it hurts people's feelings again it's cult-like good to hear from
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:05.280]  you appreciate your call julia in kentucky you're on the air hi alie oh yeah first of all before i
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:11.200]  say anything else before i talk about donald trump i wanted to tell you to check out stern c-e-r-n
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:18.480]  september 23rd 2015 because there may not be another election this might just be to cover up for a
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:23.440]  lot of stuff that's going on right now but anyway about donald trump i wanted to say that he might
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:29.600]  be in some type of prostitution reign i know it i'm not trying to you know bring him down or anything
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:35.680]  but uh that might be why the clintons are trying to bat back him up because my son worked for him
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:43.440]  in his casino uh in indiana and uh he uh he worked at the gambling table he was a dealer and he met
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:48.800]  this woman there and she was a filipino woman and she tried to fix him up and she actually did
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:55.280]  fix him up with her niece who was from the philippine and uh she does this with a lot of women uh
[02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:59.520]  from the philippines i don't i don't know what she's doing but sure but that's not prostitution
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:06.800]  ringing in mail order brides well well she's doing more than that my son believes that she's got some
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:11.600]  type of a prostitution ring thing going on with donald trump because they're really good friends
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:17.280]  and she's really rich she's got a lot of money she buys uh mercedes and stuff no wait a minute
[02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:23.680]  there are no prostitutes at casinos okay there are no fish in lakes and and there's no birds in the
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:30.480]  sky and i'm sure donald trump is perfect wonderful guy you can google donald trump and women and him
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:35.120]  you know at the miss americ whatever all hanging on him you know i'm a libertarian my view is on
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:39.840]  it decriminalize it all because making it criminal only allows it to be seedy and controlled by the
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:46.800]  mafia but yeah no i mean clearly donald trump has all the swagger and all the aplomb of a gangster
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:52.560]  uh and then all that he hangs out with gangsters like clinton's he says a lot of great stuff
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.080]  it's good to see him slap a bunch of politically correct scumbags around uh but that said
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.440]  it doesn't pass the smell test but i don't want to just get up here and you know speculate and
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:15.760]  claim that donald trump is in prostitution rings um i mean i mean i appreciate your call
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.800]  i'll tell you what dinecore and haliburton and others have been caught that doesn't mean if you
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:24.800]  weren't for haliburton you're involved let me be clear but it came out in mainstream news
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:32.000]  nbc news chicago tribune a decade ago that they were running operations where they were grabbing
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.800]  underage women boys you name it throwing them on c 130's and they were just disappearing
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.960]  and we knew this because you and people blew the whistle so the sky's the limit i mean that's the
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:50.480]  thing they'll bust some john you know picking up a hooker on south congress in austin texas
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:55.760]  and throw the book on them at least they did in the old days they don't really do that now
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:05.440]  no and then though if some big company is actually running you know sex trade with underage women
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:09.360]  brought into houston nothing's done about i mean there are whole areas of the country
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:13.280]  where it's just well known they're running basically sex slaves into the country out of the
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:19.680]  country nothing's done so if it's big official oppressive white slavery and every time i say
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:23.520]  that i get an email going oh you don't care about black slavery white slavery means sexual slavery
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:29.600]  ladies and gentlemen i know most of you know that but if it's if it's real slavery they leave it alone
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:35.840]  but if it's a woman on her own out there making some money then they'll call it prostitution or
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:40.800]  whatever and and so i guess if you take a woman out to dinner and buy her jewelry it's prostitution
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:46.560]  too by their benchmark they've had cases in this country where people hook up online and the woman
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:49.760]  wants to be taken to dinner and wants to be you know have something bought and they're calling
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:55.360]  that prostitution in new york city and taking people's cars then meanwhile it turns out the

[02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:21.600]  we're gonna go to rich and others here in just a moment that i'm gonna come back hit a bunch of
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:26.400]  news we haven't really hit yet place some important clips uh you know i don't want to say i have
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:33.600]  ferguson fatigue but just to see the public being played because there is some police brutality
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.320]  there is militarization of police there are a lot of real problems
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:42.880]  but the feds are globalist occupied they want to smash local police departments
[02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:48.000]  run them into the arms of the globalist and that's why george soros is spending
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:53.600]  over a hundred million dollars 30 plus million in ferguson alone to stir this up and has really
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:59.440]  hired a lot of nasty political operators to do it and in most the cases the justifiable shootings
[02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:05.600]  the police are engaged in uh there are other ones where they're absolutely uh executions and when
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:11.600]  there's evidence of it they're inditing the police officers there's video of just a cop pulls a gun
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:18.880]  and just shoots a white person for no reason or shoots a black person it's crazy and bigger than
[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:25.840]  population blacks being 13 percent black males being about six percent it is disproportionate
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:32.080]  black males being killed in cold blood you just can't deny it but but but compared to blacks dying
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:38.320]  from abortion or uh you know heart disease and all this other stuff it's just it just doesn't
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:45.840]  even show up on the scale less than a hundred if you look at the numbers questionable black
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:51.840]  males being shot by police a year that sounds like a big number 100 out of 300 plus million people
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:26:02.560]  i mean it is just a total diversion from all the serious things and then just creates racial
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:10.560]  animosity that i mean i grew up where you just knew racists were just idiots who just didn't
[02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:16.640]  like you because they were dumb whether they were white or black and now it's gets the point where
[02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:23.440]  even on king of the hill years ago uh mike judge made the point we'll play a clip of that in a second
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:31.280]  that i'll come on and only hate somebody of their if they're white and and it becomes this idea that
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:36.400]  whites commit more crime and and whites are inherently bad and it's just not historical
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:43.120]  it's not accurate in fact here's that uh Hank Hill clip what the hell kind of country is this where
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:51.040]  i can only hate a man if he's white we need to get mike judge live on the show he's a big
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:57.120]  listener listens all the time he even let me shoot video i'm shooting out of his house a
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:03.440]  couple times i never heard it for some reason uh i need to hear that video it's a pretty good video
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:08.240]  uh well i got a little excited during one shot it's probably why i haven't heard it
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:19.200]  we've got like 15 people shooting 308s ar-15s you name it at huge boxes of tannerite i say huge
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.720]  boxes you know maybe five ten pound boxes and while i'm talking a couple of them blow up and
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:34.560]  there's pieces of uh center block flying around and uh one of them hits me in the back of the head
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:42.640]  maybe that's why i never put that video out but uh it was good fun that wasn't one of the time i've
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:49.200]  had my kids out there shooting uh but uh definitely definitely a lot of fun uh let's talk to rich in
[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:56.560]  new york rich you're on the air go ahead hey what's up alex alex thomas trump is a game show host
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:01.200]  he's clown shoes the guy panned this to anyone who'll line his pockets he's a shill and a half
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:05.680]  and nothing more you know just like the way back once in a while i would say some things are truth
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:10.560]  because you have to mix lies with the truth in order to get people to even listen to what you
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:18.160]  say this is what this guy is clean and simple that's it well i've thought about going after
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:23.120]  trump and you could really do it showing him in the wwe showing him doing other stunts showing
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:28.960]  him flip-flopping i know well then let me ask you this why won't the other republicans
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:37.520]  like rand paul why won't they get hardcore and say the popular constitutional common sense why is it
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:44.880]  trump easy because probably because of fear you know for them their families or whatnot you're
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:50.000]  talking about gangsters here you know it's it may look at what you know it may look all nice on the
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.240]  outside but but what goes behind the scenes we have no idea i can guarantee you that these people
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:58.800]  are threatened and these people have their backs up against the wall and they're told if they say
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.040]  anything this might happen that might happen who knows what'll happen yeah i'm not allowed to say
[02:29:03.040 --> 02:29:08.880]  what i know about certain political candidates but you're absolutely right i've been told in
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:12.800]  confidence throughout the years we'll just leave it at that about some pretty wild stuff and the
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:18.160]  weird thing is when people get threatened or really weird stuff happens i mean we're talking
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:25.280]  in the category of horse heads in your bed they know it'll sound crazy if you come out in the
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:30.320]  news and talk about it so people just don't discuss it so you're absolutely right stay there rich i
[02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:34.000]  want you to have time to finish up you've held for 20 minutes and then we'll go to steve rich
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.160]  jeff mike i'm gonna blitz through these calls one minute a piece one back to rich and then i'm
[02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:41.920]  going to hit the news and then back in the calls i've done pretty good today i'm taking like 30
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:51.120]  something calls 800 2599231 we're focusing on planet trumpus we're on the march the empire's on the
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:30:02.400]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network well the epa has done it again over the weekend the
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:06.960]  group that secretly experimented on people by making them breathe diesel exhaust and the group
[02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:11.280]  that is finding people all over the country for the amount of smoke that leaves their chimneys spilt
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:16.240]  an estimated one million gallons of hazardous wastewater into the animus river according to
[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:20.480]  the epa the spill occurred when one of its teams was using heavy equipment to enter the gold king
[02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:24.720]  mine a suspended mine near durango instead of entering the mine and beginning the process of
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:29.680]  pumping and treating the contaminated water inside his plan the team accidentally caused it to flow
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:34.080]  into the nearby animus river officials said they believe the spill carried heavy metals mainly iron
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:38.560]  zinc and copper from the mine into the creek that feeds into the animus river you can see pictures
[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:43.280]  all over the internet of orange water throughout the river and local residents are concerned that
[02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:48.320]  fish and plants near the river are going to be dying en masse the epa also wants to cut out
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:52.800]  coal power burning plants which provide cheap power for the united states thanks epa for all

[02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:37.680]  i get high get high on speed top fuel funny car is the drug for me
[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:47.120]  by the way there's an article out today the golden age of muscle cars is now in us a today
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:57.280]  and i absolutely agree with us a today i um have some friends and folks that have things
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:03.440]  like the new corvettes and things like that and let me tell you i've driven 600 horsepower
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:09.440]  porches i've driven all sorts of cars that were just made you know 10 15 20 years ago
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:18.480]  they are nothing compared to american muscle now nothing and i might as well just make this
[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:25.040]  announcement only because i want to celebrate pure americana i was uh getting a jeep trading in an
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:35.040]  old jeep that i'd had for 15 years or so about two years ago and the fella at the jeep dealership
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:41.360]  i try to buy american when i can now it's owned by fiat of course but still made here
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.400]  i said hey this is a really cool dodge viper but i never get one of these plus i know it's not that
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:56.320]  fast compared to some other cars he goes wait till the dodge hellcat comes out you ought to get one
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:01.920]  he goes a comparable car would be about half a million a lower in ferrari and it'll beat those
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:08.080]  and i said you know what put me on the list well i got one of the first run i've had it
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:14.880]  like six eight months now and the car there's just nothing like it and i think i'm gonna do a video
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:20.080]  on it because it's pure americana and it wasn't that expensive i think i could sell it for more
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:26.880]  than double what i bought it for right now but i got it as a celebration of americana and i and
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:33.680]  the reason i never announced i got a hellcat was i wanted to do a whole piece on it and properly
[02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:46.960]  tie it in to just how amazing the john wane of cars is i mean it's just sick of course i've driven
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:52.160]  and i've driven like eight i've driven out in hollywood with friends before i'm not named
[02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:56.080]  robins when i was like hey everyone drive this ferrari you know 800 horsepower ferrari's that
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:03.920]  cost a million dollars just nothing compared to this and it drives like a family car it just
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:11.920]  drives normal nice and then you hit the accelerator and it there's nothing like it i mean i'm not
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:19.920]  going to tell you i've been speeding in it but because that's not safe but uh i've now digressed
[02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:25.600]  and i apologize but the golden age of the muscle car i was going to tie it into innovation and
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:32.320]  things like that but despite strict emission limits concerns about climate change and unpredictable
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:38.240]  gasoline prices that would make the 60s hot rod or pull over and wheat detroit's modern performance
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:44.160]  cars could run rings around the classics and they're surprisingly affordable yeah that's the thing
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:49.440]  when compared to the price tags of some exotic cars with similarly high performing engines because
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:56.560]  see here's the truth i like high horsepower cars i don't like standing out so when you're driving a
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:03.840]  black challenger or a gray challenger the colors they come in no one knows it's got 780 horsepower
[02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:08.880]  because everybody says it's 707 that was the original to get around the emissions testing and
[02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:14.560]  all the government harassment they've done drivetrain tests you can look this up it's got close to 800
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:21.440]  horsepower and here's the difference it delivers it all down the drivetrain all right i'm talking
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:27.360]  about this like i'm talking about maryland and roe back in the 60s and 70s we were looking at 300
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:34.320]  325 horsepower engines now you're at 500 600 and 700 said ken gross the automotive historian
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:39.600]  automotive historian a museum consultant and journalist never in my lifetime that i think
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:49.920]  i'd see the day when i could drive a 700 horsepower streetcar yeah even the least powerful of today's
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:57.440]  sports cars say a base 76 chevy camaro mustang or charger could probably out corner most of the 60
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:04.720]  muscle cars which were renowned to their ability to accelerate but not to turn or stop oh yeah i
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:12.800]  had some guy about a month ago run a red light just light turns green i'm going like 45 miles an hour
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:20.640]  going the speed limit turns green way up ahead no cars had me and this car just runs it this was
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:28.400]  like a Chevy Silverado and my car turned like it was on rails i turned and didn't hit him
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:34.880]  i mean i mean turn on a dime and that's human innovation and believe me folks they've got
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:40.800]  technology 10 times better than that i mean it's just so much more advanced than we even know
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.040]  and the globalists are all about suppressing innovation and sure it's wasteful sure we should
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:52.640]  try to conserve but it shouldn't be forced on us is my point and see i i never did the report
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:58.240]  because i didn't know how to address it how to properly give justice to it but i think i'm
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:02.800]  going to take folks out in the hellcat the audience maybe with a live stream or something
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:07.920]  under maybe we'll take that baby out of the racetrack i know buckley was out at the racetrack
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:16.240]  with some with a buddy's car had it going 172 weekends ago but you know then i think
[02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:20.480]  i don't need to be taking risks like that when i'm fighting the new world order
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:25.440]  that's why i'm on skydiving it's why i don't jump off railroad trestles 300 feet into water anymore
[02:39:25.440 --> 02:39:29.360]  stuff i used to do because i don't want to get hurt i got children and that's why i don't really
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:34.240]  speed that much in the hellcat it's almost a joke that i have it because i don't really use it that
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:41.920]  much it's just fun to be able to shoot around a couple cars real quick it has the twin super
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:47.200]  chargers and when you when you and then the second you put your foot on the gas you just hear them
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:52.880]  power up they go i mean it's it's it's amazing and then you got folks that put big pipes on their cars
[02:39:53.760 --> 02:40:00.160]  because they want to sound loud this has pipes to try to dampen it when i fire it up it rumbles
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:06.640]  the building in here but i just like human innovation i like muscle cars i like americana

[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:18.240]  would be the muscle car of patriots uh but i'm afraid he may be something else i apologize rich
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:24.880]  for going off on a six-minute diatribe about muscle cars go ahead no no that's cool and i like him
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:30.560]  too uh just just a quick note if i could alex alex you always talk about them uh about the globalist
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:35.760]  being like a uh like an alien race well this is an interesting read if you ever get a chance
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:41.920]  to read it it's an article that was changed into a book it's called transylvania to tumbridge wells
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:48.480]  by a guy named davir and it's really really interesting these are who these people think
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:54.000]  they are it's really interesting it's tied in a bit with that fiction stuff but it's really really
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:58.880]  interesting it goes into that it's connected with that whole uh holy blood holy grail that
[02:40:58.880 --> 02:41:02.880]  dan brown stuff all of it sure the merovingian the merovingian line well i mean here's the deal
[02:41:02.880 --> 02:41:08.400]  i've been to bohemian grove i've covered skull and bones the elite really believe they're channeling
[02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:13.200]  spirits they literally believe they're psychic vampires and they've got the power and they know
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:19.280]  a lot of secret stuff the public doesn't know uh i i think they're mentally ill uh but uh there's
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:25.680]  the article from transylvania to trunbridge wells uh and then what is it basically saying that they're
[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:30.400]  a devil cult or what's it break down no what it's basically saying it gets into the whole thing
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:35.280]  with the stitching stuff where you know in the room but they're saying that um they spliced their
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:41.040]  dna with uh with the hominids that were here and created was known as the uh as the first
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:46.960]  modern man this is where you get the vampires the idea of vampires from this is where you get the
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:53.120]  idea of of dwarves and uh and all the rest of that from and they were considered a you know
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:58.720]  a first race that uh was biologically wired different than we are you know this is where
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:03.760]  you get into the whole um the whole thing with the uh the drinking of blood and stuff like that
[02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:07.360]  i mean you have it in the catholic church and no one knows why it's there this is a lot of
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:12.000]  stuff in there there's a real lot of stuff in this these who these people think they are that's why
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:17.440]  you had um you had uh what's called you had intermarrying inside you know uh pharoah marriage
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:21.520]  now like you did in with the egyptians you had the same thing going on in in uh in england stuff
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:26.160]  because they wanted to maintain the blood lines why is the blood line so important because this
[02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:30.480]  is what they believed they believed i mean that's where you get you even get it in movies that you
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:35.920]  get uh no i know it's everywhere and the question is were they delusional because you know the egyptians
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:40.400]  also thought of they mummified their body they live forever or was there something real to it i
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:47.920]  know this i've been to pharoah exhibits in europe in uh new york in houston and they've got the
[02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:54.160]  skeletons of these pharaohs and they look like space aliens and the reason i say they think
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:59.600]  they're another species is you can google elite to split into new species you'll get mainstream
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:04.800]  news articles where they're saying they believe they're already a new species separate from us so
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:09.680]  they believe it and then they act like it and they act like we're here to be fed on i mean look
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:15.360]  in secret they've been harvesting babies for decades lying to us the other day's daily mail
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:20.160]  human race will split into two different species small goblin-like dwarfs of the general public
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:25.360]  and beautiful smart elites you know in the next hundred years or whatever all right i appreciate
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:29.520]  your call good to hear from you let's go to steven and florida you're on the air welcome
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:36.080]  yeah hey uh no quick just want to say the first three things i take every morning is x2

[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:48.000]  products as well so for that guy it says yourself naked well i must have been bitten because i'm
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:54.480]  hooked well god bless you thanks for the support brother yes sir appreciate it uh real quick as
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:44:00.640]  far as trump okay i'm just gonna go down to the line of the candidates marco rubio any guy that
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:06.240]  says the fourth amendment isn't worth upholding in the nsa's and spying uh that guy doesn't know
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:10.640]  he's talking about mike how could be i want to remind people this guy's a member of cfa richard
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:16.400]  half the head of the cfr which is presidential advisor in 2008 that shoots him down as far as
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:23.600]  i'm concerned rick perry 2007 bill deberg pakistan violation of the logan act and the hpv vaccine
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:31.040]  debacle back in 2008 in texas he's a liar chris christie he wants to be a republican nominee so
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:36.000]  despite of them concerned he's a fat sack of elephant dung because that's all that comes
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:41.200]  out of him when he speaks and he ought to be ashamed of himself the way he did with uh land paul
[02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:47.680]  speaking with ben karsten here's a man that says to be a christian he caved on the same sex issue
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:54.640]  but also on you you would show as david night showed yesterday he criticized ran paul as being
[02:44:54.640 --> 02:45:01.120]  uncivilized and yet ran paul hasn't really been that hard he should be harder on these guys now as
[02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:07.120]  far as donald trump here's an issue nobody's bringing up about this guy and this is why i have a
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:12.800]  problem with donald trump he brought up the casino issue and that's a biggie and you know in fact he's
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:18.640]  given to the clinton spot it's the one nobody's talking about this man's an adulterer he committed
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:26.480]  adultery on adana trump his wife couldn't trust him so how in the world can i it is a moral and
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:31.360]  a spiritual and a character issue a man like that as far as i'm concerned should never be in the
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:37.200]  white house even if he's saying a lot of the right things they're interesting point steve thank you
[02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:42.400]  for the call jeff in california i said i'd get to news but i'm all over the map here jeff here on
[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:47.840]  the air go ahead hey alec how's it going good brother you know everybody i talked everybody i
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:53.200]  talked to you ask me what do you think of donald trump you know here's a man he's he's clearly uh
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:58.160]  he has a lot of wealth and you know according to selente and all the other experts where you know
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:02.960]  we're heading for for a collapse so you know he donals always talking about being a part of the
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:09.120]  winning team well i think we have to ask donald um you know whose team is he is he playing on
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:14.000]  you know i think that he's you know he knows what's going on i think he's he's protecting his own
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:21.280]  interest and um but you know he's uh of course he's corrupt i mean he admitted during the
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:28.160]  debates that that he's bought up politicians and you know so you know he's not a squeaky clean guy
[02:46:28.160 --> 02:46:34.720]  so i you know he's also real smart he hides it in plain view and doesn't apologize right exactly
[02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:39.360]  you know and another thing is is that you know the globalist look how much time they spent grooming
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:44.880]  obama for for the presidency there's no doubt about it that they got their hands all over this
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:50.400]  election and um you know i think that if he was a real patriot that he would be uh supporting
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:56.560]  somebody like rand paul well instead you see the entire system attacking rand paul and now
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:01.840]  eclipsing him with trump and that's because they know rand paul's for real he's not perfect
[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:07.760]  but he's being demonized because they know he is the real deal and i'm just glad trump is raising
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:13.840]  these issues i'm glad he's making them issues that's positive and i think that's why i'm still
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:20.720]  reserving judgment we're exposing what he did we're saying we don't trust him but we're saying
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:28.320]  we hope he's for real we hope he doesn't scam us we hope he doesn't drop the ball uh but we're watching
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:33.360]  that's what it comes down to thank you so much jeff since the caller before last uh mentioned the

[02:54:54.640 --> 02:55:00.320]  nasa's secret so i'm not gonna say any more and it's like the time we got contacted by the head of
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:06.080]  harp who wanted to come on and then by the middle of the colonel came on and cut the interview off
[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:11.600]  but uh that was a civilian head of harp spent on they have a lot of cool listeners i'm very
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:15.920]  honored to have all these neat people listening and most folks i meet from government or major
[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:20.880]  corporations actually want to have a better world but they're high level but not at the
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:26.560]  very highest levels and it's the very highest levels that's some really nasty people and their
[02:55:26.560 --> 02:55:32.640]  argument is hey there are a lot of really bad people out there we got to be even nastier
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:38.160]  to protect the good people that's a mackey of ellie view that the unjustifies the means
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:43.840]  and historically leaves us some very bad things but uh we ought to try to fly this guy in
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:50.560]  said i'd love to have him in studio that's just just amazing that's the greatest part about this
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.600]  job is it's so humbling to have william benney in here former technical director of the nsa one
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:56:01.360]  of the most famous code breakers in the world who invented most of the stuff i mean i get to have
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:06.000]  ron paul on i get to have all these cool people i mean it's just humbling i get to talk to you the
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:15.360]  listeners you folks are just amazing you know there's no way to do justice to all this i had all
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:21.520]  this ferguson research all this stuff i was going to play i had i had all this media censorship news
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:27.280]  i wanted to get to fbi still hiding 58 year old documents about eisenhower roosevelt who's now
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:32.560]  the favorite to appear on the ten dollar bill who are they going to replace off the ten dollar bill
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:42.000]  who's on the 10 now i forget i think it's hamilton hamilton now he's on the 20 i don't know that's
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:51.040]  jackson jackson oh they're gonna start these the racists oh my gosh oh i can't elinor roosevelt
[02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:57.440]  or the elinor roosevelt who's an occultist and a lesbian but i mean if she is those things just
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:04.800]  be honest about it but janet reno on the ten dollar bill and they can have a little burning
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:11.040]  children all engraved on it and then you can have a more realized her when this police caught her in
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:15.280]  miami with a 12 year old girl in the back of her car with vomit all over because reno passed out on
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:19.840]  pain pills and whiskey then we just have like on the back of the ten dollar bill can be reno
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:24.880]  with a half naked girl vomiting on her and then if you're against that you're against diversity
[02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:30.720]  and then we can have clinton raping a woman on the front biting her on the lip while he rapes her
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:38.400]  i mean why not he did it and if he's god then it's okay right and then on the other side of
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:44.400]  the bill we can have like a dine core airplane with little kids getting loaded on it but but
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:48.800]  have a real micro engraved so you gotta have a magnifying glass to see all of it
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:50.800]  but
[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:57.600]  the one thing i like trump's done is that he has come out and called for cutting taxes and the
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:03.520]  second thing i like is you know saying that he believes autism spectrum disorders are linked to
[02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:08.640]  vaccines but i mean you've got most of the public believing that now and the evidence
[02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:13.600]  showing it so he's kind of going with the party there ap mysterious fungus killing snakes in at
[02:58:13.600 --> 02:58:19.920]  least nine states hidden on the hillside's remote part of western vermont a small number of
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:24.880]  venomous timber rattlesnake slithered among the rocks but their isolation can't protect
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:28.720]  with the mysterious fungus spreading across the eastern half of the country that threatens to
[02:58:28.720 --> 02:58:35.440]  wipe them out the evidence shows it's linked to gmo hey the honeybees are dying too what's the big
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:40.320]  deal i mean if you don't want to kill the honeybees you're racist against roundup drink the roundup

[03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:31.040]  okay hello welcome to you um uh first off uh you you're a hell of a research researcher and uh
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:37.440]  i would wish you would look at a book called um uh fossilized customs come out of her my people
[03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:45.680]  and uh the remnant ministry but anyway on thompson i think he's a major distractor of rand paul yep they
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:50.880]  did this they did this with ron paul because that's why ron paul never got in the white house
[03:00:50.880 --> 03:00:56.400]  and that's what hunkerbee was for then yeah exactly and this is exactly what they're doing with
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:01.200]  rand paul oh yes it's great that trump is bringing out all this information and all the
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:06.000]  truth but i can say he's mixing truth with lies you know and he's such a clinton supporter and
[03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:11.440]  everything and i'm afraid he's gonna flip flop at the end and hand the whole election over to
[03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:17.760]  hillary clinton you know well anyway you look at it that's what he does if he drops out or
[03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:24.800]  runs third party and i just can't imagine hillary clinton as president i don't want to say i'm gonna
[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:30.160]  leave the country but i'm gonna be honest i may be forced to leave the country if she gets elected
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:35.440]  i mean they're already after me it's already come out in the news and i'm on their enemy's list
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:42.800]  matt drudge is on it world net daly's on it and i'm not afraid of them but i'm also not in a suicide
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:50.240]  pact uh you know i just i just want to be left alone i'm not i'm not here in some battle with
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:56.000]  the clintons i just there are a bunch of crooks destroying my country and i would be remiss if
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:02.720]  i didn't stand up against them uh that said if this country elects hillary clinton i just can't
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:10.400]  handle it anymore i uh i mean hillary is so evil god bless you i appreciate your call mike
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:14.400]  i actually started having an anxiety attack just for a second i mean
[03:02:17.200 --> 03:02:23.280]  i can't handle it anymore all these people are evil buddy we're not doing anything about
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:30.000]  them aborting babies and selling their body parts i mean the sky's the limit we are just screwed
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:34.480]  i'm not trying to be negative there's a lot of waking up happening a lot of good things happening
[03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:41.360]  it's just i am so sick of the clintons i have been on air 20 years and i know all about them

[03:03:01.440 --> 03:03:08.400]  think trump is going to be the idiocracy of america i think he's going to be uh what was that
