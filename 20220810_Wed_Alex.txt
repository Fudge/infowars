[00:00.000 --> 00:18.480]  Info wars tomorrow's news today
[00:49.920 --> 00:51.920]  Go, go, go, go, hey, go
[00:54.080 --> 00:56.080]  Go, go, go, hey, go
[00:56.080 --> 00:58.080]  Get canceled
[00:59.200 --> 01:01.920]  Less than 48 hours after the deep state
[01:02.640 --> 01:04.640]  raid on the president's sclora
[01:06.080 --> 01:09.460]  Residence less than 48 hours after the ransacking
[01:09.460 --> 01:14.560]  We now learn where every piece of paper in the building including the resort was taken
[01:15.680 --> 01:18.320]  Cocktail napkins menus toilet paper
[01:18.880 --> 01:21.600]  The order was scoop up every piece of paper
[01:21.600 --> 01:26.240]  including tags that had come back from the cleaners that were on Melania
[01:26.240 --> 01:34.680]  Trump's clothing in her closet. Unbelievable. But the backlash and the
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.800]  awakening that this is triggered is absolutely insane. They've got national
[01:40.800 --> 01:44.840]  polls out where over 90% of Americans are against this. They have Democrat
[01:44.840 --> 01:49.960]  pundits suddenly on CNN saying it was a bad thing to do. They really know they
[01:49.960 --> 01:53.960]  stepped in it because everybody knows about Hillary destroying all her emails
[01:53.960 --> 01:59.360]  and computers and hard drives and chips, memory chips. Everybody knows about the
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.640]  incredible crimes they've committed. Everybody knows that they're completely
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.320]  above the law. Hunter Biden's laptop, the list goes on and on and then Hillary
[02:07.320 --> 02:13.040]  had the nerve to put out a clothing line bragging that she got away with all of
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.120]  her crimes. Wait till we cover that. These people are completely out of their
[02:18.120 --> 02:23.120]  minds. The population of this country and not just here but around the world is
[02:23.120 --> 02:27.120]  waking up to the globalist occupation. They're waking up to the permanent coup
[02:27.120 --> 02:31.320]  and we have quite the investigative journalist and author on today. We've
[02:31.320 --> 02:34.480]  had a lot of requests for him. We finally got him. We were setting this up weeks
[02:34.480 --> 02:37.960]  ago but it just happened to come through yesterday. We're right at the perfect
[02:37.960 --> 02:44.880]  time. Lord works mysterious ways. Lee Smith wrote the plot against the
[02:44.880 --> 02:50.360]  president and the permanent coup is uniquely poised to discuss what we're
[02:50.360 --> 02:55.240]  currently living in the permanent coup. Look, the New World Order already took
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.080]  over. I mean we're inside it now and that's why they've got to take us off
[03:01.080 --> 03:03.440]  the air. That's why they've got to demonize us to make us the Sandy Hook
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.480]  man for just questioning a mass shooting. It's because we have been
[03:07.480 --> 03:13.040]  completely vindicated in spades and our credibility has gone straight through
[03:13.040 --> 03:18.440]  the roof. So has yours speaking out and standing up against this evil. So has
[03:18.440 --> 03:23.840]  Tucker Carlson. So has Joe Rogan. So have countless other people and so
[03:23.840 --> 03:31.360]  everybody across the country, a wide spectrum of every cross-section from
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.120]  liberals to conservatives to even former rhinos are really waking up the fact
[03:36.120 --> 03:42.680]  this is dangerous. The Alec Show show trials, the Trump Marlago raid, the 86
[03:42.680 --> 03:48.720]  thousand IRS agents to target average Americans. Yes, folks, they're tyrants
[03:48.720 --> 03:51.920]  that are cutting off our energy. They're criminals that are dissolving our
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.640]  borders. They have destroyed the blue cities. Everyone is trying to leave or
[03:56.640 --> 04:02.440]  has already left. I love the New York mayor says he's gonna ship New Yorkers
[04:02.440 --> 04:06.600]  to Texas. The New Yorkers are already moving here. They're already shipping
[04:06.600 --> 04:11.560]  themselves, dumbass. But I love the deep state wanting to flood the country and
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.760]  collapse it to drive down wages and create an even bigger permanent
[04:15.760 --> 04:25.160]  underclass while they declare the underclass not essential. And while they
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.760]  say not in my backyard. With these people, it's all about the murder of
[04:30.760 --> 04:35.760]  logic. The establishment is launching wars. The establishment is devaluing
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.760]  currency. Establishment is openly preventing promoting pedophilia and we
[04:40.760 --> 04:45.880]  are the rebels. We are the black sheep. We are the resistors. We are the
[04:45.880 --> 04:50.800]  resistance and we are proud in America's darkest hour to be a leading light in
[04:50.800 --> 04:54.560]  the fight against these people as the Great Awakening explodes in the battle
[04:54.560 --> 04:56.320]  against the New World Order is great reset.
[05:01.720 --> 05:05.400]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government
[05:05.400 --> 05:09.800]  doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to
[05:09.800 --> 05:13.880]  control your life, the big tech companies, they don't want you to read this
[05:13.880 --> 05:18.480]  book. They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.360]  don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't want that. And this book shows you
[05:22.360 --> 05:26.640]  what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against
[05:26.640 --> 05:30.800]  it. And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't
[05:30.800 --> 05:35.720]  work, that freedom is alive in this country. This is essential reading. And,
[05:35.720 --> 05:40.240]  you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.800]  not going to be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in
[05:43.800 --> 05:47.640]  libraries. They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they
[05:47.640 --> 05:51.560]  can, but they're not going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't
[05:51.560 --> 05:55.320]  work by the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones. I really appreciate you having
[05:55.320 --> 05:59.360]  me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out
[05:59.360 --> 06:15.720]  there. Big brother mainstream media government cover. You want to stop
[06:15.720 --> 06:21.920]  tyranny? Well, so does he live from Austin, Texas broadcasting world
[06:21.920 --> 06:41.400]  live? It's Alex Jones. So I was in that show trial, hangar report last week
[06:41.440 --> 06:45.520]  where the corrupt, Soros funded Democrat judge already told the jury I was
[06:45.520 --> 06:51.520]  guilty. One of the pinhead ambulance chasers got up there and said, So you
[06:51.520 --> 06:56.120]  claim the governments involved the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton
[06:56.680 --> 07:01.960]  with child trafficking. And I'm like, What you mean like Jeffrey Epstein and
[07:01.960 --> 07:07.640]  the Clintons with the witnesses of the child rape and then go into that
[07:07.640 --> 07:12.360]  island dozens of times. The Democrats answer to that is go, Oh, look, here's
[07:12.360 --> 07:16.720]  a picture of Trump in New York and Marlago at parties with Epstein. Okay,
[07:16.720 --> 07:20.280]  there's any evidence Trump sent him to president, but there's not. As if I
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.760]  would support Trump. I mean, it's proven to actually be raping kids. There's a
[07:23.760 --> 07:29.200]  zero evidence. But there's total evidence with them. They try to defend it. And
[07:29.200 --> 07:36.040]  then it broke Monday night that the judge that did this that signed off on
[07:36.040 --> 07:40.400]  this ransacking with armored vehicles and over 100 agents, taking every piece
[07:40.400 --> 07:44.040]  of paper, including menus and cocktail napkins out of the resort, not just
[07:44.040 --> 07:49.200]  out of Trump's private apartment office, including clothing tags on
[07:49.200 --> 07:57.320]  Melania Trump's garments, every piece of paper, rider trucks full of
[07:57.320 --> 08:01.240]  everything, hoping they find something with all their fake prosecutions they've
[08:01.240 --> 08:07.120]  got going. And it turns out the judge decades ago, first, it was 2008. He was
[08:07.120 --> 08:11.800]  a direct advocate for Epstein and child trafficking directly on the cases,
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.320]  defending him and other pedophiles. But it turns out they go back at least 10
[08:16.320 --> 08:25.560]  years before that. It's a club of sick garbage. It's a club of people that
[08:25.560 --> 08:33.440]  hate our families and hate God and hate our children. Simply insane. But now
[08:33.440 --> 08:46.280]  it's all over the news that it's a special Jeffrey Epstein operative. Absolutely
[08:47.000 --> 08:55.920]  disgusting. And these people are very proud of who they are. And they think
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.040]  they've got us whipped. I think because they control the central banks and the
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.120]  media and the Justice Department that they are routing the American
[09:04.120 --> 09:06.960]  opposition, when all they're doing, according to all the evidence and
[09:06.960 --> 09:12.000]  numbers we have, is triggering a explosion and the already expanding,
[09:12.000 --> 09:19.840]  accelerating great awakening. So their attacks on us pointing out these
[09:20.120 --> 09:24.760]  pedophile enabler connections in the power structure with judges has backfired
[09:24.760 --> 09:34.840]  as spectacularly since last week. On your show is your allegation that
[09:34.840 --> 09:40.080]  government officials are aiding in pedophilia, child trafficking and
[09:40.080 --> 10:05.200]  the greed of children. Your allegation that government officials are aiding in
[10:05.200 --> 10:11.280]  pedophilia, child trafficking and the greed of children. What do you mean like
[10:11.280 --> 10:23.000]  what Jeffrey Epstein did with Clemens? So ladies and gentlemen, this is the cult
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.400]  we're up against. This is what we're battling. And boy, are they upset that
[10:28.400 --> 10:33.040]  all over Fox News it's being pointed out this is a Jeffrey Epstein advocate and
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.440]  enabler that launched this clearly illegal criminal raid citing a U.S.
[10:38.440 --> 10:43.160]  government statute that a government employee caught getting rid of
[10:43.160 --> 10:46.880]  government documents can be barred from running for office. That doesn't count
[10:46.880 --> 10:51.840]  the statute from the president of the United States. They control the National
[10:51.840 --> 10:57.280]  Archives. They decide what goes in the National Library. Everybody knows that.
[10:57.280 --> 11:04.960]  This was a giant dragnet trying to find something to indict Trump with these
[11:04.960 --> 11:09.560]  dozens of fake investigations they've got going. Just like it was falsely claimed
[11:09.560 --> 11:16.880]  in court last week that they had my whole phone and that I'd hidden it but my
[11:16.880 --> 11:24.920]  lawyer had given it to him and we went and looked and it was six month chunks
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.760]  when we turned over everything they ordered and they still defaulted us that
[11:29.760 --> 11:36.800]  the paralegal in Connecticut had been going through the 2030-40 depending on
[11:36.800 --> 11:43.720]  the search terms in my phone and then sent on the search results to them but
[11:43.720 --> 11:49.960]  then they left a raw search or a raw tranche of six months of text messages
[11:49.960 --> 11:54.040]  and we spent a few hours that night reading them all and said there's nothing
[11:54.040 --> 11:57.640]  there except they'll probably make something about my wife and a bikini as
[11:57.640 --> 12:02.360]  if that's wrong. Drag queen pedophiles good, pedophilia is good, new world
[12:02.360 --> 12:08.040]  waters good, child sex trafficking is good but a woman you know in in a leopard
[12:08.040 --> 12:13.480]  bikini that is evil and dirty especially if they have womanly curves and
[12:13.480 --> 12:17.680]  her athletic that is just not what I mean that's not what we're supposed to
[12:17.680 --> 12:24.600]  have and of course now yesterday CNN just let it out Oliver Darcy you covered
[12:24.600 --> 12:29.160]  the trial just kind of let it slip out that oh well actually it's not January
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.520]  6th stuff in there it comes right up to that no it doesn't so a few months at
[12:34.520 --> 12:40.400]  the end of 2019 some months into April about six months in total and there's
[12:40.400 --> 12:47.520]  nothing there because I say everything on the air I'm not hiding anything and I
[12:47.520 --> 12:53.760] 'm a good guy despite the fact to act like I'm Lex Luthor so now Raskin the head
[12:53.760 --> 12:57.880]  of the Jan 6th committee has gone on national TV we got that clip coming up
[12:57.880 --> 13:05.120]  hell we'll just play part of it right now and Raskin has said that well we're
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.160]  not going to comment on investigations but yes we have his phone we have no you
[13:09.160 --> 13:12.520]  don't have my phone you don't have two years that's been a lie since it was
[13:12.520 --> 13:17.560]  said in court and it's a lie now and they know that but they don't care the
[13:17.560 --> 13:20.280]  same committees falsified a bunch of text messages and emails from the
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.640]  president and others trial refused to testify and took the 5th not because I
[13:25.640 --> 13:28.840]  was incriminating myself but because they can't be trusted their criminals
[13:28.840 --> 13:35.760]  they'll twist everything so let's go ahead and play clip one this is a Fox news
[13:35.760 --> 13:39.320]  Phil Keating talking about the big elephant the room the big the big
[13:39.320 --> 13:42.640]  pedo in the room here it is and this morning the New York Post is now
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.720]  reporting that the federal magistrate here in Florida who approved this search
[13:47.720 --> 13:54.080]  warrant after he left working for the U.S. Attorney's Office back in 2008 he
[13:54.080 --> 13:59.120]  then went into private practice and represents seven several of associates
[13:59.120 --> 14:09.040]  of the disgraced financier and accused serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein is it

[20:51.680 --> 20:56.320]  articles the videos you support the broadcast you are the resistance you
[20:56.320 --> 21:01.640]  are the tip of the spear and I salute you for your will and your strength and I
[21:01.640 --> 21:08.720]  love you all right this ties into what's just happened to President Trump in
[21:08.720 --> 21:14.320]  Mar-a-Lago here's the head of the Jan 6 Kangaroo Committee that have been caught
[21:14.320 --> 21:16.920]  in so many lies and so many falsifications of documents that makes
[21:16.920 --> 21:22.640]  my head spin talking about how they've got my phone they do not have my phone
[21:22.640 --> 21:27.520]  that is a lie they have a group of texts that were searched by lawyers to turn
[21:27.520 --> 21:33.720]  over to them years ago that's what they have from the lawsuit just like when
[21:33.720 --> 21:37.240]  they said oh we got your phone yeah you got it for my lawyers it was all just a
[21:37.240 --> 21:41.880]  trick they didn't have the phone that was a lie then they accused me of lying
[21:41.880 --> 21:47.440]  and perjury when I told everybody they gave us the search terms we gave them
[21:47.440 --> 21:53.720]  almost 400,000 damn emails in Texas and Connecticut my fricking text messages I
[21:53.720 --> 21:57.640]  handed the phones to the lawyers the old phone the new phone you get phones over
[21:57.640 --> 22:03.960]  the years we keep the old phone they searched them and then these people get
[22:03.960 --> 22:09.080]  a group of texts that had been searched but were the raw text and try to pretend
[22:09.080 --> 22:16.720]  that it was me lying to the court it's just unspeakable but that's what they do
[22:16.720 --> 22:24.160]  and now here imagine of McCarthy was without warrants getting people that he
[22:24.160 --> 22:31.920]  had testified in the un-American House Committee and Senate committee the
[22:31.920 --> 22:34.960]  committee on un-American activities imagine if they have without warrants
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.280]  people's diaries even back then people wouldn't put up with that but today
[22:40.280 --> 22:43.800]  because it's happening to a populist and a Christian and someone that's trying to
[22:43.800 --> 22:47.520]  rally the people for their freedom and for my freedom and my children's freedom
[22:47.520 --> 22:52.320]  they just calmly sit up there and lie about what they have and talk about
[22:52.320 --> 23:00.840]  without a warrant having my personal information because it's open season on
[23:00.840 --> 23:05.160]  American patriots because we live in an occupied tyrannical system and so many
[23:05.160 --> 23:10.160]  collaborators want to suck up to it and go along with it they're a joke
[23:10.160 --> 23:17.760]  unbelievable the things that go on and the and there's more going on behind the
[23:17.760 --> 23:24.200]  scenes I'm not ready to release at this point but it's bad imagine what these
[23:24.200 --> 23:31.600]  people do and how they then farm out the people's phone numbers that are in your
[23:31.600 --> 23:39.880]  phone imagine imagine the harassment because they never have any consequences
[23:39.880 --> 23:43.920]  they never get in trouble like all tyrants they think they have a free
[23:43.920 --> 23:50.680]  hand chill they don't and boy are these people tyrants 86,000 more IRS agents
[23:50.680 --> 23:56.620]  to harass they admit blue collar workers let's go ahead and play some of
[23:56.620 --> 24:01.960]  Raskin this morning along with the fallout of the FBI search of former
[24:01.960 --> 24:06.320]  president Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate there's also new movement from the House
[24:06.320 --> 24:10.640]  Select Committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol today
[24:10.640 --> 24:14.640]  the committee is scheduled to meet with Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate and
[24:14.640 --> 24:21.200]  election denier Doug mustriano and they are reportedly now in possession of all
[24:21.200 --> 24:27.680]  of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones text messages as well joining us now to
[24:27.680 --> 24:31.040]  discuss that and a lot more member of the oversight committee and select
[24:31.040 --> 24:36.520]  committee investigating January 6th congressman Jamie Raskin let's start
[24:36.520 --> 24:42.360]  with a Alex Jones text messages to what of interest is in there
[24:42.360 --> 24:49.160]  well good morning you know what we're not commenting on specific evidence that
[24:49.160 --> 24:52.640]  we've received in what role it might play in our investigation but obviously
[24:52.640 --> 24:59.480]  we are interested in receiving all evidence that will shed light on the
[24:59.480 --> 25:06.480]  plan to destabilize and overthrow the 2020 presidential election and so that's
[25:06.480 --> 25:11.120]  why we're following all leads in order to put the evidence together and make a
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.080]  complete report to Congress into the country and that process continues and
[25:15.080 --> 25:22.320]  we're using our time in August to explore further leads that came up in the
[25:22.320 --> 25:26.600]  first part of our investigation you know given that you've been so closely
[25:26.600 --> 25:30.920]  looking at and monitoring not just the president's behavior but those around him
[25:30.920 --> 25:36.320]  leading up to and on January 6th I'm just curious your reaction I know you
[25:36.320 --> 25:43.400]  can't say much to the FBI search and the removal of documents from Mar-a-Lago
[25:43.400 --> 25:47.280]  over the past 20 that's enough of that and he's the head of the investigation
[25:47.280 --> 25:59.880]  itself it's Bernie Thompson is the lead lead moron so there you go now let me
[25:59.880 --> 26:03.680]  show you some of these headlines MSNBC admits Alex Jones Sandy Hook lawsuit
[26:03.680 --> 26:09.240]  sent to the president Fox News Tucker Carlson is next Paul reveals just how
[26:09.240 --> 26:17.880]  much the January 6th committee has failed upwards of 90% think it's
[26:17.880 --> 26:24.120]  worthless MSNBC admits Alex Jones said he had such a new president here's that
[26:24.120 --> 26:27.840]  article that I just mentioned oh and then here's Oliver Darcy I'm not gonna
[26:27.840 --> 26:30.960]  bore you with the possums talking I could have yesterday already play this
[26:30.960 --> 26:34.520]  clip yesterday but here's the clip on his Twitter and he covered the kangaroo
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.320]  trial I was in for two weeks and he says I'm told the Alex Jones text indicate
[26:38.320 --> 26:42.280]  he was talking to people in Trump's orbit ooh America's talking to people
[26:42.280 --> 26:47.920]  can't do that but the text apparently don't include messages from January 6th
[26:47.920 --> 26:55.680]  or the immediate lead-up oh oh oh oh they don't have the whole phone or even 5%
[26:55.680 --> 27:02.600]  of the phone they lied and I can't believe the possum is spinning it but
[27:02.600 --> 27:07.880]  still telling partly the truth I didn't know he could actually tell the truth
[27:07.880 --> 27:17.680]  then another article out of the Atlantic which is owned by Steve Jobs widow who
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.720]  is a frequenter of Epstein's Island and best friends with Gisling Maxwell really

[27:33.600 --> 27:39.920]  way to stopping is putting him in prison what nice people and Rhino Mitt Romney

[36:12.880 --> 36:19.440]  standing up for America and when we'll talk to you soon sir powerful interview
[36:19.440 --> 36:24.560]  yesterday full interview at band.video right up at the top please share it a
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.040]  blueprint for victory we have the plans of the new world order we're now living
[36:30.040 --> 36:34.480]  under it it's only to get worse from here on out until we say no and stop them
[36:34.480 --> 36:39.840]  in their tracks. So let's just go over the big stacks of news on the raid that
[36:39.840 --> 36:43.280]  is really blowing up in their face whole numbers the vast majority of
[36:43.280 --> 36:46.720]  Americans are totally against it a huge wake-up call they even have Democrat
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.920]  pundits on CNN saying this was bad news here it is ladies and gentlemen Bruce
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.800]  E. Reinhart Donald J. Trump plaintiff defendants Hillary Clinton and all those
[36:57.800 --> 37:01.880]  FBI agents that created the fake dossier and the whole fake Russiagate thing
[37:01.880 --> 37:08.320]  remember that lawsuit Trump filed earlier this year he was the judge that they
[37:08.320 --> 37:13.440]  put over the case he then recused himself but he should have been
[37:13.440 --> 37:21.400]  conflicted out to then sign this dragnet search warrant but again he was
[37:21.400 --> 37:27.280]  Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer for his pedophile scam our logo raid backfiring
[37:27.280 --> 37:32.400]  on establishment as Americans awaken to weaponization of the government Trump
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.520]  shatters all fundraising records that were Biden's FBI raid on Marlago
[37:36.520 --> 37:42.760]  details of what FBI sees at Marlago make FBI raid look downright scandalous says
[37:42.760 --> 37:46.840]  redstate and boy are they right they took every piece of paper including cocktail
[37:46.840 --> 37:51.960]  napkins and menus from the restaurant not just out of his private apartment and
[37:51.960 --> 37:57.760]  private office and safe that was empty by the way remember the flashback Schumer
[37:57.760 --> 38:02.360]  warned Trump about the intelligence community panic them scramble to
[38:02.360 --> 38:08.560]  redefine raid after FBI's raid against Trump backfires in full wars calm judge
[38:08.560 --> 38:12.440]  you signed off an FBI raid made anti-Trump post we're now learning of
[38:12.440 --> 38:17.040]  course coordinated attack Trump says Joe Biden knew all about the FBI raid on
[38:17.040 --> 38:23.120]  Marlago and it goes on and on Trump now saying the FBI could have planted
[38:23.120 --> 38:26.080]  evidence because they wouldn't let anybody have security cameras on they
[38:26.080 --> 38:29.440]  wouldn't let them watch them as they dug through everything gee you think these
[38:29.440 --> 38:38.320]  guys would actually set something up even Lindsey Graham on Fox News we're
[38:38.320 --> 38:42.560]  gonna play that in a moment when asked about could the FBI plant things on
[38:42.560 --> 38:49.400]  people play clip 5 in a moment he had to say yes think about that and it gets
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.080]  worse we have a compilation video of Judge Reinhart saying it's okay that
[38:53.080 --> 38:56.640]  Hillary and others and Loris Lerner of the IRS persecuting conservatives
[38:56.640 --> 39:02.160]  destroyed emails and computers but Trump oh he's a criminal Trump says Marlago
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.200]  staff and lawyers were blocked from watching the raid and it goes on and
[39:07.200 --> 39:11.520]  on and of course here's the crack one of the crack FBI agents that was there
[39:11.520 --> 39:17.400]  wearing their mask and all the rest of it auditioning to be the star of the new
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.400]  job of the Hut special that Disney is producing but Mitch McConnell is
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.240]  basically silence on it Trump ally Rick Perry says the FBI sees his cell phones
[39:27.240 --> 39:32.120]  one day Trump ally representative Scott Perry not Rick Perry says FBI sees his
[39:32.120 --> 39:37.640]  cell phone one day after Marlago raid the drag net the desperate drag net just
[39:37.640 --> 39:42.400]  continues the judge you okay Marlago raid is a big Obama donor well of course
[39:42.400 --> 39:48.440]  he is they're all part of the Epstein Club Trump raid sparked by boxes of
[39:48.440 --> 39:55.360]  materials including Kim Jong Unletters and cocktail napkins FBI scoured
[39:55.360 --> 40:02.280]  Melania's wardrobe at Marlago looking for I guess her shoes deeply disturbed by
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.520]  these three things happening in one week Helen Roy says Alex Jones show trial
[40:06.520 --> 40:11.840]  Marlago raid expansion to the IRS at the greatest level ever and Google reports
[40:11.840 --> 40:21.160]  record number searches after the raid for the term civil war what a time to be
[40:21.160 --> 40:25.880]  alive but it gets even more insane Hillary Clinton fundraises after Marlago
[40:25.880 --> 40:32.040]  raid rags about not getting the same treatment here's the sickening photo of
[40:32.040 --> 40:38.200]  her they photoshopped it on it says but her emails so they can all buy a black
[40:38.200 --> 40:43.800]  hat with pink lettering saying oh but her emails to make a big joke about it
[40:43.800 --> 40:49.520]  wow truly disgusting here's a close-up shot of it nothing you want to look at
[40:49.520 --> 40:56.360]  Hillary too closely but that is the rub it in your face garbage but meanwhile
[40:56.360 --> 41:02.800]  Trump back candidates sweep the board in the next group of primaries that just
[41:02.800 --> 41:07.000]  happened last night so that's why they're so panic that's why these raids are
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.840]  happening no amount of their propaganda is going to be able to reverse that here
[41:13.840 --> 41:17.840]  is Jesse Waters and Lindsey Graham talking about well everybody knows the
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.520]  FBI plant stuff and burns down churches and shoots women holding babies in the
[41:22.520 --> 41:26.280]  head at Ruby Ridge yeah they're really nice folks here it is having you on
[41:26.280 --> 41:28.920]  Lindsay you know you and I have a debated about things and I've seen you
[41:28.920 --> 41:34.960]  pretty spitting mad over Ukraine but you don't seem as mad as you were about
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.600]  this than you've been mad about Ukraine I don't understand why people aren't
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.240]  lighting their hair on fire I don't understand why people aren't out in the
[41:42.240 --> 41:45.760]  streets this isn't like oh well you know let's just see what's in the warrant I
[41:45.760 --> 41:50.200]  mean they've been doing this this is the third election this is a third election
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.400]  we know they doctor evidence we know they plant evidence we know they hide
[41:54.400 --> 41:58.760]  evidence we know they lie we know they leak I mean this is not anything new this
[41:58.760 --> 42:02.200]  has been this has been years they've been doing this we can't just say oh you
[42:02.200 --> 42:05.800]  know we're waiting for the guy to come out and and give a statement about what

[42:12.040 --> 42:17.640]  and of course don't forget in the Whitmer kidnapping plot led by four FBI
[42:17.640 --> 42:23.040]  agents and five informants that they bullied and basically threatened the
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.240]  young men that were involved looking for father figures into agreeing that they
[42:27.240 --> 42:30.840]  would be part of a kidnapping plot but saying I really don't want to but the
[42:30.840 --> 42:35.920]  FBI it turned out edited those audio clips to make it sound like they were
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.920]  gung-ho when they actually said they didn't want to that's why they got quote
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.600]  off because they didn't do anything wrong and now they're on national TV saying
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.600]  they had my phone when they don't and saying it's got January 6 evidence on

[47:02.480 --> 47:19.760]  lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[47:40.160 --> 47:52.000]  it is Babylon the people are rejecting it 86,000 look at this number 86,852 new
[47:52.000 --> 48:01.520]  IRS employees on top of the hundreds of thousands they've already got and look
[48:01.520 --> 48:08.280]  at this illustration of your TV viewer by Mike Salona here is a 87,000 person
[48:08.280 --> 48:15.720]  stadium the number of IRS agents Biden just forced you to hire and the media is
[48:15.720 --> 48:18.360]  trying to spin it that they will absolutely not target middle income
[48:18.360 --> 48:22.080]  Americans that's a load of crap they admit that almost all enforcement is
[48:22.080 --> 48:29.440]  against working class and middle class people and that's in the funding actually
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.440]  took out a bunch of taxes for billionaires in the legislation it's just
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.000]  amazing the screw job that's going on but oh they care about working people
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.040]  that's why they have cut the energy supply and killed the pipelines and
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.320]  drilling because they will they love you while they move all the jobs to China
[48:45.320 --> 48:49.280]  and Mexico and other places it's just incredible I want to play this judge
[48:49.280 --> 48:55.560]  Reinhardt when he's done TV interviews defending lowest learner of the IRS
[48:55.560 --> 48:58.840]  persecuting people and admitting she did it by the hundreds of thousands because
[48:58.840 --> 49:03.160]  they were conservatives under Obama and who does Reinhardt support he says he's
[49:03.160 --> 49:07.480]  an Obama follower he loves the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and he's a big
[49:07.480 --> 49:11.720]  Obama donor and of course all the lawsuits that Trump files basically get
[49:11.720 --> 49:16.120]  handed over to him to kill and that's why we're in so much trouble but here's a
[49:16.120 --> 49:19.720]  few minutes of him defending criminal activity and we're gonna play a little
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.800]  refresher on lowest learner and what she did under Obama because it's about to
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.840]  happen a hundred times worse here it is being oversaw overseen by Eric Holder
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.720]  cannot be you know we won't see due process yeah it's offensive not
[49:33.720 --> 49:36.560]  necessarily because I happen to know mr. Cole and the Attorney General Holder
[49:36.560 --> 49:40.480]  personally and like them personally it's offensive because I served in the
[49:40.480 --> 49:43.960]  Justice Department under Democratic administrations and Republican
[49:43.960 --> 49:47.320]  administrations and the same argument was made about both being prepared and
[49:47.320 --> 49:51.040]  finally someone in the administration admits that the destruction of two
[49:51.040 --> 49:55.720]  years of emails from lowest learner is fishy to you this is past the smell test
[49:55.720 --> 50:00.160]  unfortunately having been in government a long time the fact that well let me put
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.400]  it this way incompetence doesn't necessarily lead to criminality so which
[50:04.400 --> 50:08.120]  which out of those two scenarios right there seems more likely to you at this
[50:08.120 --> 50:12.400]  point within the IRS probably incompetence the IRS has one of the most
[50:12.400 --> 50:17.080]  antiquated computer systems in the world and the fact that emails could have
[50:17.080 --> 50:19.560]  disappeared without miss learner knowing about it or miss learner being
[50:19.560 --> 50:23.440]  involved is entirely credible to me and that I'm sure will be her explanation is
[50:23.440 --> 50:26.960]  that she was a very high-level person in the department when the subpoena came in
[50:26.960 --> 50:30.400]  from Congress it was delegated down to people who did this for a living they
[50:30.400 --> 50:34.240]  were instructed to find everything information came back up to her that
[50:34.240 --> 50:38.320]  said this is what we have she reported what she was told and it turns out not to
[50:38.320 --> 50:42.120]  be true but that's not a crime if she didn't know it wasn't true that's not a
[50:42.120 --> 50:45.080]  crime and that's going to probably be where her defense lies you know shut it
[50:45.080 --> 50:49.160]  off I can't listen to the rest of it it came out and they testified that they
[50:49.160 --> 50:54.560]  were ordered to target conservative nonprofits and conservative organizations
[50:54.560 --> 51:00.320]  okay so they got caught red-handed there he is back at the time trying to spin
[51:00.320 --> 51:06.160]  it let's look at a compilation of some of the criminal things that happened
[51:06.160 --> 51:11.720]  under Obama and the IRS and and it's been true that since they got their
[51:11.720 --> 51:18.480]  political bloody nose they have not been as bad as the worst period in US history
[51:18.480 --> 51:22.680]  of the IRS starting political dissidents it's still been going on we've been
[51:22.680 --> 51:26.760]  under audit here for a year didn't make a big deal about it but the point is is
[51:26.760 --> 51:35.200]  that now it's about to go into high gear here's a compilation
[51:42.640 --> 51:47.880]  last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open
[51:47.880 --> 51:51.800]  the floodgates for special interest
[51:52.200 --> 51:57.040]  then the IRS starts targeting conservative organization
[51:57.040 --> 52:18.600]  can you give us assurances that the IRS is not targeting particular groups based
[52:18.600 --> 52:22.960]  on political leanings first let me start by saying yes I can give you
[52:22.960 --> 52:36.280]  assurances
[52:36.280 --> 52:41.080]  after the targeting scandal broke the early political narrative was it was
[52:41.080 --> 52:46.080]  the fault of two rogue agents in Cincinnati line our IRS employees in
[52:46.080 --> 52:50.320]  Cincinnati improperly scrutinizing 501c4 organizations by using words like
[52:50.320 --> 52:55.280]  tea party and quotes and patriots it wasn't a couple of crazy people in
[52:55.280 --> 52:59.560]  Cincinnati that this information actually went up to the chief counsel of
[52:59.560 --> 53:03.680]  the IRS which was one of two political appointees by the president of the
[53:03.680 --> 53:13.000]  United States in the entire IRS I will not answer any questions or testify
[53:13.000 --> 53:20.120]  about the subject matter of this committee's meeting the eyes have it the
[53:20.120 --> 53:26.600]  eyes have it contempt report is ordered reported to the house he was held in
[53:26.600 --> 53:31.480]  contempt but the committee has asked for every single if I asked for it clear
[53:31.480 --> 53:34.480]  back in August from Danny were fall and he told me the same thing you did we're
[53:34.480 --> 53:40.080]  trying we're hoping we're gonna get there someday sometime we want them all
[53:40.080 --> 53:44.640]  there are as commissioner does the agency law since Lois Lerner first

[53:48.920 --> 53:54.360]  superiors for all her emails dating back to 2009 do you believe in Easter Bunny
[53:54.360 --> 53:58.800]  do you believe in Santa Claus do you believe that Lois Lerner's emails just
[53:58.800 --> 54:11.280]  suddenly went poof I don't believe you this is incredible and it continued on

[54:15.800 --> 54:20.480]  race in 2012 the ACLU would have been limited in its ability to even mention
[54:20.480 --> 54:25.640]  President Obama or Governor Romney during a period covering almost 300 days of
[54:25.640 --> 54:29.480]  that year the new definition of political activity could not be more
[54:29.480 --> 54:35.040]  targeted at Tea Party Patriots if the IRS had spent the last three years two
[54:35.040 --> 54:41.440]  months and ten days drafting rules specifically to silence us and now the

[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:17.600]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one from the
[1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:45.720]  front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:50.880]  for less than 20 minutes Alex Jones questioned the official narrative of
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:55.400]  the Sandy Hook school shooting because for the so-called truth or community
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:01:00.440]  that was the big story and so he did his job and covered the story just like he's
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:05.320]  done for the other 1.8 million minutes of his career Alex Jones has been
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:08.920]  questioning the official narrative of the corrupt mainstream media and
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:15.400]  exposing the authoritarian cabal hiding in the shadows for 28 years and over
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:22.560]  time this revival of truth has grown into millions worldwide Alex Jones expanded
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:27.520]  his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:32.920]  toxic world of a corrupt system which has allowed info wars to remain a free
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:39.440]  public broadcast to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media in 2018
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:45.240]  with zero evidence of their wild claims a George Soros funded lawsuit was
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:51.600]  filed against Alex Jones and info wars four months later big tech removes info
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:57.040]  wars from the Internet we were meant to be destroyed four years ago but thanks
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:01.680]  to an awakened audience that cares about the truth the info wars signal has
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:06.160]  only grown stronger and now they are no longer hiding the fact that they are
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:10.800]  standing on the graves of dead children and using their grieving parents as a
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:16.440]  political weapon to silence all of alternative news media I ask that with
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:24.280]  your verdict you not only take Alex Jones platform that he talks about away
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:32.280]  ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform that's what matters
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:39.440]  take him out of this discourse of this misinformation of this peddling of lies
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:48.600]  and make sure he can't do it again Alex Jones is patient zero for our
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:57.720]  society's inability to speak without lies he is patient zero for alternative
[1:02:57.720 --> 1:03:03.560]  facts and according to Judge Gamble acting like O'Brien straight out of George
[1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:12.840]  Orwell's 1984 the judge decides what is true you may not say to this jury that
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:20.000]  you provide the discovery that is not true you may not say it again you may
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:26.400]  not tell this jury that you are bankrupt that is also not true you're already
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:33.240]  under oath to tell the truth you've already violated that oath twice today
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:42.080]  in just those two examples it seems absurd to instruct you again that you
[1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:48.480]  must tell the truth while you testify yet here I am you must tell the truth while
[1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:55.480]  you testify this is not your show do you understand what I have said yes I
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:04:00.240]  believe I said was true so yes you believe everything you say is true but
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:05.560]  it isn't your beliefs do not make something true that is that is what
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:10.680]  we're doing here just because you claim to think something is true does not make
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:14.840]  it true there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:19.760]  dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy estate the decision to
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:26.200]  terminate the info wars broadcast is not in the hands of this crooked cabal it
[1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:32.000]  is and always has been the will of our audience that decide our fate the
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  info wars audience has mobilized and awakened to the world to the threat that
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:42.200]  is globalism and with your continued support we will keep going join us
[1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:54.840]  now and support the info war we come back in t-minus 60 seconds tell everybody
[1:04:54.840 --> 1:04:57.200]  you know tune in
[1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:04.320]  the great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government
[1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:08.760]  doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to
[1:05:08.760 --> 1:05:13.040]  control your life the big tech companies they don't want you to read this book
[1:05:13.040 --> 1:05:17.600]  they want to control what you think what you do what you read but you don't
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:21.560]  want that and Alex Jones doesn't want that and this book shows you what's
[1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:25.920]  happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it and
[1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:30.200]  so by buying this book you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work that
[1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:35.240]  freedom is alive in this country this is a central reading and you know I would
[1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:39.680]  go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in it's not going to
[1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:43.680]  be available in bookstores it's not going to be available in libraries they're
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:47.560]  going to try to take it down from every platform that they can but they're not
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:51.440]  going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't work by the great
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:55.040]  reset thank you Alex Jones I really appreciate you having me on and I
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:06:00.560]  appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there
[1:06:03.800 --> 1:06:10.920]  you are either with the Republic or against it resistance to Titans is
[1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:16.680]  obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:24.440]  you're now into our number two of this in battle pro-human populist pro-american
[1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:28.600]  transmission and I want to get him on for a while it's just perfect timing that
[1:06:28.600 --> 1:06:34.680]  he is joining us today with the deep state permanent bureaucracy trying to
[1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:39.320]  stay in power and trying to submit its permanent coup he spent as a veteran
[1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:45.400]  journalist whose works appeared in real clear investigations the Federalist and
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:50.000]  Tablet he has deconstructed the Russiagate hoax and the greatest coup
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:55.880]  against a president in the history of America in his last two books the plot
[1:06:55.880 --> 1:07:00.640]  against the president and the permanent coup he's uniquely poised to discuss the
[1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:05.400]  latest FBI raid on Trump's residents he's worked in media for 30 years writing
[1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:08.640]  about national politics foreign policy in the press Smith reported from the
[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:11.520]  Middle East for a decade of 9-11 attacks and wrote the critically
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:18.240]  acclaimed strong horse power politics and the clash of Arab civilizations a
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:22.400]  senior fellow at the Hudson Institute Smith is a frequent guest on you name
[1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:28.400]  it Fox CNN everything else truth social at Lee Smith on Twitter Lee Smith DC
[1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:32.200]  Lee I've got a lot of questions obviously but I think I should just let you
[1:07:32.200 --> 1:07:38.480]  roll here with as an American as a journalist as a leading expert on this
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:42.360]  permanent coup what we're witnessing and how you would describe this as a
[1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:46.960]  historian in the future looking back on what's currently happening well first
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:50.160]  Alex I just want to say it's a real honor to be on with you today thank you
[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:54.000]  so much for bringing me on I really appreciate it and yeah it's an
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:58.480]  especially meaningful time I saw you were speaking to Steve Bannon yesterday I
[1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:03.240]  really appreciate the two of you speaking about how important this fight is
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:07.560]  how important this struggle is and exactly what we're fighting for and our
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:11.920]  ancestors are are looking down upon us from beyond and our children our
[1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:15.960]  children's children will be speaking about this time for generations it's
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:20.960]  it's extremely important what we're seeing unfold here and you mentioned
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:24.600]  something before about my book the strong horse which was reporting from the
[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:29.520]  Middle East I think one of the clearest ways to understand what's happening here
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:38.040]  is we're seeing a joint combination combined efforts of the media and the
[1:08:38.040 --> 1:08:42.120]  intelligence services and this is typical of third world security regimes
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:45.840]  that we see throughout the Middle East whether we're talking about places like
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:52.680]  Egypt Lebanon Iran the press the media it's the propaganda operations this is
[1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:58.720]  the outward face the public face of the spy services and that's what we're
[1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:03.640]  seeing here and this is what I described in the plot against the president and
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:06.160]  it's also what I described in the permanent coup the plot against the
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:11.560]  president is a a story in particular about Russiagate and how Congressman
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:17.200]  Devin Nunes really uncovered that scandal and how he pushed back and how he
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:21.680]  fought back with very little help at first from the Republican Party they
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:24.520]  were all scared and I think that one of the things we're seeing right now of
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:31.960]  course is a lot of Republican officials even after the raid on Mar-a-Lago a lot
[1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:37.480]  of Republican officials are still scared of confronting both the FBI and other
[1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:44.160]  intelligence services and that's a real problem that our political instrument
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:49.360]  that the Party of Freedom that our political instrument inside of
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:55.360]  Washington is worried about confronting the enemies of the American people
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:00.880]  inside Washington coming up next segment I'll play a clip that's been making
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:05.600]  the rounds again of Congressman Ron Paul when he was first in Congress back in
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:09.840]  the 80s talking about the danger of the FBI becoming a Praetorian guard like a
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:14.160]  third-world country and overthrowing the Republic that's why when it was set up
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:17.440]  by Woodrow Wilson a lot of people in Congress said this would end up
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:21.120]  happening and the FBI has a long history of political operations but now it's
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:28.240]  become surely political and it's completely naked yeah I mean just to go
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:33.080]  back to that book I wrote on Arab civilizations look at that time this was
[1:10:33.080 --> 1:10:36.560]  right after 9-11 that's when I moved to the Middle East and we were under the
[1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:41.720]  we were under the impression then that or I was you were you were saying
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:45.520]  something different and you were correct you were right about different things
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:50.400]  like the Patriot Act different problems Glenn Greenwald Glenn Greenwald was
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:54.440]  right a number of different people were pointing this out whether they were on
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:57.160]  the right or whether they were on the left they were saying look here's what
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:02.280]  power does it will corrupt our system and this is precisely what happened with
[1:11:02.280 --> 1:11:08.240]  the FBI with the CIA and then they added security services like DHS so we've seen
[1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:12.840]  the problems with that and I think if you look at what happened in the immediate
[1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:18.480]  aftermath of 9-11 that's when things really started to spin out of control so
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:24.600]  that people as Rand Paul still fights against this as he still talks about the
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:31.040]  problems with with the intelligence bureaucracies this is a fundamental
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:37.400]  struggle right now for the country and when it came out last year that the
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:43.080]  National Association of school boards had and then the Democrats low-level had
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:48.480]  sent letters to Homeland Security asking them to treat protesting parents who
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:53.080]  might raise their voices as terrorists the Fed said oh they didn't know anything
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:56.960]  about it but it turned out the Justice Department asked them the letters now
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:02.320]  public to do that so they even want to target parents at PTA meetings I mean
[1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:07.240]  this is a real desire and then last year as you know Biden said the main threat is
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:11.640]  domestic extremists now and directed all the agencies internally on the people so
[1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:16.280]  this is really the classical signature isn't it of a country declining into an
[1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:22.160]  all-out police state absolutely look a lot of this stuff has been you know it's
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:27.480]  not only been test run in the Middle East by security regimes like that but but by
[1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:35.760]  China as well if you look at what happened right after 9-11 the Chinese the
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:40.680]  Chinese went to George W. Bush and they said you want our help on on the global
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:44.640]  war on terror you want us to stand aside when you go into Iraq here's what we
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:51.080]  want an exchange we want you to designate a Uighur group as a foreign
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:56.480]  terrorist organization the Bush administration because they prioritized
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:00.360]  Iraq because they prioritize the global war on terror they went ahead with the
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:05.040]  Chinese on this scandal when the Chinese basically wanted to designate an entire
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:10.160]  minority population the Uighurs as a foreign terrorist organization that's
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:15.720]  exactly what the Biden administration did after Joe Biden's election they
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:21.520]  decided to designate everyone who didn't vote for Joe Biden as a domestic
[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:24.760]  terrorist so a lot of the stuff that we're seeing here look I'm not blaming
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:29.360]  foreign countries what's being done to Americans right now is being done to
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:32.840]  Americans by our own government absolutely you're using your gravitas
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:36.320]  being a top reporter that witnessed this for a decade in the Middle East and
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:42.160]  study the relationships to see that the classical paradigm of a domestic
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:48.160]  hitlerian style takeover the same way Hitler got control from 33 to 40 before
[1:13:48.160 --> 1:13:51.440]  he launched the main war is what they're also doing here this is a tried and
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:56.760]  true checklist they're following it's just shocking for us though I mean I
[1:13:56.760 --> 1:14:01.200]  appreciate how difficult it is for so many Americans to look I mean I've been
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:04.840]  speaking since that book the plot against the president came out I've been
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:07.760]  trying to explain to people I've been saying look the issue is not that the
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:11.560]  press is lazy the issues not that the press is biased the issues not that the
[1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:16.040]  press missed the story right that's not the issue the issue is as strictly this
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:23.200]  as you said with third world security regimes the press is aligned right it's
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:29.200]  part of the operation and I think I think that this is one of the things that's
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:34.560]  become very clear to people right now after the raid of Mar-a-Lago I think
[1:14:34.560 --> 1:14:38.560]  that people understand that this is what's happening this is a third world
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:43.920]  style security regime and everything they're doing can be understood if you
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:49.120]  understand how these totalitarian regimes work and look this is a totalitarian
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:53.040]  regime what we mean by that is not only the methods but the way that it tries to
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:59.480]  insert itself in people's lives in every way right you must be vaccinated
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:04.320]  they're going to interfere with your own bodily integrity you must be
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:08.880]  vaccinated then they're gonna mess with your children right no we can say
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:12.600]  whatever we want about your kids and their gender identity none of it never
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:16.760]  you mind we can say anything we want about your kids and race it's this is a
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:23.120]  full spectrum takeover yeah of a totalitarian regime absolutely trying
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:28.600]  to invade every space in American society including the individual space
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:32.880]  and cutting off sovereignty absolutely you're on fire and cutting off the
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:36.160]  energy supplies shutting off not just the keystone pipeline but thousands of
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:41.040]  spurs stopping most the drilling I mean we are under siege how do we get out of
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:44.560]  it how do we unite peacefully and stop this Lee Smith is one of the leading
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:48.400]  intellectuals on understanding this we're very honored to have him dr. Beattie
[1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:52.480]  also does a great job but this guy is amazing Lee will be right back please
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:57.120]  stay with us we'll play that Ron Paul clip from the 80s as well
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:02.880]  people say Alex Jones crazy he's a conspiracy theory guys a nutcase you got
[1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:09.160]  these ramps and all that what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on
[1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:14.880]  so many different topics of signal not noise if you look at the signal and you
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:20.960]  compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:25.880]  versus what your collective body has put out there and if you're a set in a

[1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:21.680]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones you know most of our history we
[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:26.960]  didn't didn't have those institutions the FBI came in during the first world
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:32.480]  war and interestingly enough the one thing that woodrow wilson did he use the
[1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:37.840]  FBI to spy on American citizens and actually arrest them if they disagreed
[1:20:37.840 --> 1:20:41.640]  with his foreign policy about going to war in Europe and isn't it interesting
[1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:46.440]  how recent they used it in the vietnam era democrats used there republicans
[1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:51.080]  used the FBI to spy on a hundred different groups in this country including
[1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:55.680]  the churches who disagree with the policy in central america almost looks
[1:20:55.680 --> 1:21:01.000]  like the FBI was designed to spy on americans who might be disagreeing with
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.600]  policy especially the foreign policy so the FBI although i don't think i can
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:09.040]  condemn everything they've ever done because i'm sure some of the
[1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:13.920]  investigations and investigation of crime has been beneficial but that could
[1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:17.360]  be accomplished through justice department within our states we wouldn't
[1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:23.600]  reject that portion of it i think the FBI has kept and continues to keep a lot
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:28.840]  of records on a lot of individuals the CIA has only been here since 1947 their
[1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:32.920]  record is lousy and you just think of the CIA used by the democratic
[1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:39.920]  administration to as we were sitting here during the break it broke in court in
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:44.120]  michigan that the FBI didn't just falsify records and edit tapes to have the
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:47.960]  so-called militia say they were gonna kidnap her they were leaving it turns
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:52.360]  out they now have admitted they planted the explosives and the people they
[1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:55.880]  charged nothing to do with it so surveilling people planning evidence on
[1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:59.760]  them doctoring statistics claiming that we had the biggest year of domestic
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:03.160]  terrorism ever last year because they added basically all people that are
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:09.120]  white committing crimes as terror it is unbelievable if there's a checklist of
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:13.520]  tyranny author lee smith they are really going down the line and making sure
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:17.880]  they've checked off every box yeah that's exactly what's happening and look
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:22.680]  you hear a lot of a lot of talk people say well i don't know let's see the FBI
[1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:27.640]  definitely needs reform i think if you look at how the FBI started and the
[1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:32.040]  FBI's role the last several decades i think that we have to conclude that
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:35.960]  this is an institution that america is better off without right we hear about
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:39.920]  the different look and it's not just going after domestic terrorists right
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.120]  meaning people who didn't vote for joe biden in particular white people who
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:46.440]  didn't vote for joe biden we also look at the long history and this is stuff
[1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:49.960]  that glenn greenwald has been really great on talking about how they've
[1:22:49.960 --> 1:22:54.640]  targeted uh muslim americans right they've gotten that they've entrapped a
[1:22:54.640 --> 1:23:00.240]  lot of a lot of muslims here during the global war on terror so i think if we
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:04.560]  look at this record we have to recognize that this is a very destructive
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:09.880]  institutions destructive american peace prosperity and also friendship this is
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:15.080]  one of the institutions that's breaking that's breaking the friendship that the
[1:23:15.080 --> 1:23:19.160]  american people are supposed to enjoy with one another what have they done
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:24.520]  instead they've made the american public suspicious of each other i don't know
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:28.120]  the those look like domestic terrorists i don't know that guy's a muslim
[1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:33.880]  terrorist this is supposed to be a country that's supposed to thrive right on
[1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:39.360]  its affection for one another we are our own center of gravity the american
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:44.560]  people it's not washington it's not the fbi it's not the white house it's the
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:50.920]  american public we are our strategic depth well you're right to point out
[1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:56.480]  even the new york times back when it wasn't totally pro 1984 had headlines
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:01.320]  saying majority of terror plots hatched by the fbi and it was had the number
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:09.160]  97 out of like 103 cases over the decade previous to that they had gone and
[1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:15.480]  found usually autistic or borderline mentally retarded muslim young men and
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:20.400]  literally posed as imams and commanded them in some cases harangued them for
[1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:25.560]  years to agree to go bomb something well that's that's not catching somebody
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:31.040]  that's leading people into terror and so we now know persecuting muslims was the
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:38.920]  training wheels and now like in Indiana Jones and the temple where he's trying to
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:44.520]  get the statue and put the sand on the lever raiders the lost ark it's the
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:48.280]  same way they're moving muslims off the persecution point they were the training
[1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:52.600]  wheels and putting conservatives and patriots now as the new target the bait
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:55.800]  and switch just happened right after january 6th but they were already
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:59.680]  preparing it before they've been doing this they've been doing this for quite
[1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:03.760]  a while as you spoke you mentioned the michigan case the whitmer case you know
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:07.720]  some of the great reporters on that you mentioned darin beaty darin is darin is
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:10.920]  great julie kelly is another great reporter who's been on this and one of
[1:25:10.920 --> 1:25:14.520]  the things that they've written about is you know is this some of the so-called
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:17.680]  members of the so-called militia I mean there was a guy who was sleeping in a
[1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:22.440]  vacuum cleaner repair store I mean what the FBI does it appears and I know about
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:26.560]  this from russia gate what they do is they go after people who they feel are
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:31.160]  not connected they feel that these people are however they would describe it
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:35.200]  they feel that their loners their weaklings look at who they went after to
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:39.760]  get the spy warrant on the trump campaign carter page right this is not a
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:43.360]  well-connected washington guy this is someone they figured it figured that
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:47.560]  they could target this is what they do they go around picking on people they
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:51.120]  figure that they can go after they they think of these people as weak people
[1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:55.360]  when in fact carter pages is a great guy really smart guy they went after
[1:25:55.360 --> 1:25:59.040]  george poppetopoulos they went after michael flinn they feel that they can go
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:03.760]  after people who no one else is looking out for no one else is protecting it's
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:09.080]  a very very sick organization it certainly is a very very sick
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:13.040]  organization I remember back in the mid-1990s I was getting politically
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.960]  involved in things and I wasn't in militias I wasn't calling for violence
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:22.000]  and I had FBI informants repeatedly come to me and say you know let's carry out
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:26.040]  an attack let's do that I'd go out and get their license plate and I'd go have
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:29.600]  it run and find out they actually work for the feds or were agents and it was
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:36.360]  so naked or I'd be you know at a event or something just signing autographs and
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:39.800]  somebody walk over hey we ought to blow up a federal building and then I'd say
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:42.360]  really and then we just follow them outside and they'd be in an unmarked
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:47.360]  police car I mean it's very ham-fisted to how they do this oh no I mean we've
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:50.760]  all seen the videotape now of ray apps right and you have I mean it's great
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:54.120]  because the guy starts madding off about oh we have to rush into the Capitol
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:56.960]  tomorrow tomorrow rushing into the Capitol and everyone around him is
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:27:00.800]  looking around is this guy serious and they say they start chanting fed fed fed
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:04.920]  that's how obvious these characters are and thank God that the you know that the
[1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.840]  American people are starting to recognize what's going on right now and
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:11.440]  again one of the things that happened with the raid a lot of people is like
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:15.040]  well you know I actually did think even though I recognize there are problems
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:19.240]  with the FBI and DOJ that this whole thing just seems like a shipwreck it
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:24.960]  seems absolutely 100% unsalvageable look it's gonna be some time before the you
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:28.840]  know before the American people can do something about it but right now I think
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:33.040]  that all of our attention is focused on this stuff this is a very very important
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:40.000]  thing so what what the raid represented is something horrible and an evil and an
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.040]  awful turn in our country's history but but just the way that you and Steve
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:47.320]  Bannon were speaking about yesterday that there is a general awakening going
[1:27:47.320 --> 1:27:51.520]  on right now and this is very positive thing right it's a positive thing and
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:54.720]  so far as Americans see that we're in the middle of a real struggle for the
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:58.440]  future of our country for what's gonna happen and so the more and more that
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:02.000]  Americans can see unfortunately these heartbreaking things that happen to the
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  soul of a country the more Americans can understand what's happening the more
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:12.080]  that we can't embrace each other as fellow Americans and say we got to fix
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:15.360]  this this is really terrible this republic is not gonna make it if it
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:18.960]  keeps going like this you're absolutely right of course you pioneered
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:23.200]  exposing the Russia hoax which they now admit was a hoax in your book the plot
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:27.920]  against the president that became a movie a major hit documentary yeah it's a
[1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:32.080]  great Amanda Milius and our listeners know all this and then they actually are
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:35.080]  sick of hearing that we're not Russian agents but I want to walk through the
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:40.560]  attempted framing of Trump because that's the new version of what they're
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:45.360]  doing and then how do we stop this and looking forward into the future what do
[1:28:45.360 --> 1:28:49.520]  you expect in this escalation of deep state tactics permanent code tactics
[1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:53.640]  for them to do next that is so critical with 90 days of the midterm elections

[1:32:56.920 --> 1:33:02.320]  men I go and see him quite often now leading a frontal assault on the lies of

[1:33:16.200 --> 1:33:23.960]  alex joneshow I hear people talking about about the way we have to live
[1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:36.000]  here in this country I don't need to tell you that Jack Mesovic is completely
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:42.240]  dialed in to the American resistance he wasn't just in naval intelligence and I
[1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:46.440]  can tell you that he is a real patriot and when he tells you something you can
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:51.640]  bet it's true and it's not just Jack Mesovic it's a source it's a lot of key
[1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:55.400]  sources I have inside the deep state's desperate they have every intention of
[1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:59.080]  indicting Trump they have more than 20 fraudulent rigged investigations going
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:02.760]  on right now this raid is just the beginning here's the latest emergency
[1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:09.880]  report issued by Jack Mesovic Donald J. Trump his personal residence was rated
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:16.320]  yesterday by the American Stasi the FBI and so in this program we're going to
[1:34:16.320 --> 1:34:23.480]  go through the modern history of this organization but that being said we could
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:29.320]  go all the way back to the story days of the FBI's founder J. Edgar Hoover and
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:33.480]  I'll tell you something right now I'm sure that wherever he is right right now
[1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:39.120]  enjoying the heat down there he's smiling that they're keeping his legacy
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:46.560]  alive this is what the FBI has always been a weapon utilized against the
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:52.320]  political opponents of the regime and we're not even gonna go through all of
[1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:56.320]  their history from the 1960s in the 1970s you can go look it up we've covered
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:01.080]  on other programs but this is what they've been doing for a long long time
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:05.720]  okay maybe maybe I'll throw one out there in the last segment but you're gonna
[1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:10.360]  have to stay tuned for that they're gonna claim this is over classified
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:16.520]  material and I stayed up last night until three in the morning working my
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:21.840]  sources work in the chain did President Biden know about this you better
[1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:26.600]  believe he did President Biden and Chief of Staff Ron Klain found out about this
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:32.400]  while Biden was in quarantine for COVID he's still in quarantine for COVID Chris
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:37.120]  Ray signed off on it the FBI director but it's really being driven by Attorney
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:43.880]  General Merrick Garland Garland is seeking an indictment of former President
[1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:48.280]  Trump I'm gonna say that again and I'm going to footstomp it
[1:35:48.280 --> 1:35:54.480]  AG Merrick Garland Biden's Attorney General is seeking an indictment of
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:36:01.160]  President Trump why you'd have to ask him personally I think it's a revenge I
[1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:05.960]  think this he is working out some deep-seated revenge fantasies that he
[1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:12.360]  has because he views the right in general as being the ones that blocked him
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:17.040]  from getting what he always wanted like golems ring he wanted that seat on the
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:22.680]  Supreme Court and he doesn't care what he has to burn down to get revenge on the
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:38.000]  people that he believes took it from him or denied it to him
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.400]  getting back into the raid what it signifies clear moves to indict President
[1:36:43.400 --> 1:36:48.720]  Trump you've got a lot of history on this what what do you gut level see them
[1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:52.920]  pulling and what what do you expect the deep state to pull out of that bag of
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:57.840]  tricks they've got well I think Jack is right I just add one name to that and
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:37:03.000]  that's the number two at the Justice Department who is Lisa Monaco I believe
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:08.840]  that she you know she was also a participant in Russiagate as part of
[1:37:08.840 --> 1:37:13.560]  the outgoing Obama administration setting up you know the preposterous idea
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:17.720]  that Donald Trump was a Russian asset so that's another name I put out there
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:24.160]  something else to be looking at I I I thought from the very beginning that
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:27.960]  they went into this raid that it has nothing to do with classified material
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:32.640]  that they're using that as a pretext they're using that as a pretext it's a
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:37.040]  fishing expedition they're looking for whatever they can find to tie him to you
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:42.400]  know January 6th if you look at how the Mueller the Mueller investigation ended
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:46.200]  right they couldn't prove obviously they couldn't prove collusion what they tried
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:50.160]  to do was they tried to move it to an obstruction case there was no obstruction
[1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:54.840]  case bill bar for all of his faults came in and said you guys have to end this
[1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:58.600]  it's over enough they weren't able to make an obstruction case there are
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:02.240]  thousands of people throughout Washington DC most of them Democrats but not
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:06.320]  entirely who are furious they weren't able to get Mueller to lay those
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:09.840]  obstruction charges on Donald Trump and charge them right then and there and
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:13.880]  frog walk him out of the White House I believe that this is the same kind of
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:17.320]  case they're looking to make right here because this is the case they've been
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:22.520]  making against lots of January 6th defendants obstruction cases I believe
[1:38:22.520 --> 1:38:26.040]  that this is precisely the case they want to make against Donald Trump now
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:30.920]  regarding January 6th again I don't think it has to do with classified
[1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:36.040]  information I mean of course they could take basically anything they want and
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:40.960]  and get Trump get Trump convicted in the Washington DC court but I think this is
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:44.960]  about something else I think it's about January 6th because this strikes real
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:50.280]  regime core interest right because it's about it's about opposing Joe Biden
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:54.640]  it's about opposing the regime the men and women who went out on January 6th
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.640]  the exercise the First Amendment rights and protest looking at at the very least
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:05.240]  election of regularities in so far as they were opposing the regime this is a
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:09.480]  core interest to stop this I believe that this is what they need to go after
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:16.560]  Trump for and yeah I think that we are more than likely to see an indictment
[1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:23.280]  by October I think that for me the only question and it's not that big a question
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:28.200]  is whether they try to do to him what they did to Roger Stone what they did to
[1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:33.440]  Peter Navarro you know whether they whether they whether they handcuff him
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:40.240]  and whether they do this in front of CNN and of course the the the dangers that
[1:39:40.240 --> 1:39:46.720]  that would lead to the kind of you know the the the the the spiritual blow the
[1:39:46.720 --> 1:39:52.520]  country would absorb especially the America first faction it's it's hard
[1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:58.680]  to anticipate on the side of it I think they're trying to already claiming oh
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:02.120]  armed people are coming to our logo they're gonna attack the FBI I think they
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:06.200]  have a history of provocaturing they just got caught with ray epps on January
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:10.560]  6 they got caught red-handed in multiple ways with the Whitmer kidnapping plot
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:16.000]  that was completely synthetic and so clothing they're trying to elicit some
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:20.840]  type of right-wing response or at least claim it's a right-wing response when
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:24.520]  they stayed something I'm really worried about false flags I'm really concerned
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:28.000]  about that but before we get to that what is your view on Bernard Kirk the
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.880]  former New York Police Commissioner saying next move is they'll try to kill
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:34.480]  Trump I agree with that or they could kill Biden it claimed the right wing did
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:38.560]  it as a false flag I mean to me those are basic authoritarian moves they've done
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:43.400]  in other countries if I was them and I was a psychotic sociopath I would do
[1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:46.880]  that I'm not saying I would do that right I don't want Biden or Trump to get
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:50.120]  hurt but the point is is that I think we need to understand there's a major
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:53.080]  escalation everything they're doing what do you expect to do next or you
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:59.040]  concerned about an assassination of Trump I mean look I not really but I have
[1:40:59.040 --> 1:41:02.680]  to say we've seen different things happening here over the last five years
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:07.280]  that would have been a unimaginable to our grandparents right they would have
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:10.480]  that for all the different problems that this country's had for a very long
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:13.360]  time I don't think anyone would have anyone would have expected the
[1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:16.640]  different things that again that we've seen the last five years we're seeing
[1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:23.280]  a recklessness by the establishment oh look and it it's evidence of weakness
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:28.880]  right these are desperate sick and crazy people it's very reckless and even
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:33.720]  though we say well look that doesn't make sense this this White House is
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:37.720]  reckless right so it's certainly possible the Jan 6 committee knows they
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:41.480]  don't have my phone they just made that up seeing it admits they don't have my
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:46.000]  phone Oliver Darcy did because he talked to him but they it's all a lie I mean
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:54.560]  just everything they do is just insane lying right I it's the whole thing is
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:41:58.200]  very very worse because it is so reckless and this is this is part of it
[1:41:58.200 --> 1:42:03.160]  look I started to notice this during the COVID lockdowns when we started to see I
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:06.120]  was living in Washington DC at the time and I started to see the people who are
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:10.120]  on the street and I started to see interactions between human beings and
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:14.320]  in supermarkets and people were so anxious and so tense and so crazy then I
[1:42:14.320 --> 1:42:18.320]  started to realize where they forced us to live inside the heads of very
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:22.560]  desperate crazy people and that's what this regime is if you look at they go
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:28.280]  from operation to operation whether it's Russiagate to Kavanaugh to impeachment to
[1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:34.440]  George Floyd to COVID to January 6 these are mentally unstable people a monkey
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:38.440]  box as it might be box lit like that exactly month boxes it killed one
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:44.640]  person exactly it's the same thing and part of it is operational the other
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:49.440]  part of it is emotional and spiritual these people are all over the place
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:53.240]  they're destructive and chaotic and that's the world they're trying to make
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:57.080]  us live in that's right stay there let that happen I agree Lee Smith will be

[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:07.600]  World Order it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:19.560]  Not just America but the world is at a crossroads right now you can't hear from
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:24.600]  President Trump on Twitter because he was banned by big tech but his son is
[1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:28.680]  still there and put out this announcement with links to the National
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:33.000]  Archives and the New York Post reporting it. At the end of his presidency
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.520]  Barack Obama trucked 30 million pages of his administration's records to
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:41.640]  Chicago. More than five years after Obama's presidency ended the National
[1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:47.160]  Archives webpage reveals that zero pages have been digitized and disclosed and
[1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:51.960]  the truth is the president under executive privilege has that power and
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:57.800]  then they decide what to put in their libraries. The idea that Trump can't take
[1:47:57.800 --> 1:48:02.880]  documents out that are his is preposterous. Lee Smith I could ask a
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:05.560]  hundred questions in the eight nine minutes we have left in this segment
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:11.280]  but what facets of this incredible decline of our republic do you want to
[1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:15.480]  cover next and perhaps you've got some ideas for solutions on how to reverse
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:21.040]  this trend but the as you said the recklessness of these anti-American
[1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:24.160]  forces that are in control the intelligence agencies the media everything
[1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:27.920]  they do fails they overplay their hand but they just launched operation after
[1:48:27.920 --> 1:48:32.400]  operation after operation and all the aggregate news and polls show they've
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:36.400]  lost credibility they're destroying themselves but they're still in power so
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:40.240]  they can't help it they never give up but they were smart they'd mitigate they'd
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:44.840]  back off we go back to sleep but instead they are just craze and wild-eyed
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:49.160]  doing this what do you predict the different scenarios are? They're
[1:48:49.160 --> 1:48:55.280]  desperate and dangerous desperately dangerous likely to cause trouble not
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:48:58.760]  just here at home but likely to cause trouble abroad as well as they already
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:05.600]  have you know engaging in more pointless strategically pointless foreign
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:09.000]  conflicts I think one of the most important thing is before we start
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:12.760]  looking at solutions before we start figuring out how to fix it which of
[1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:21.240]  course for us the advocates the believers the faithful in the constitutional
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:26.040]  order it's it's through votes it's through organization that's that's what
[1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:31.680]  our that's what our struggle looks like the other thing is for everyone if they
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:35.600]  are reckless the more reckless and the more crazy they get that means the
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:40.120]  cooler the more detached the more responsible we should be as I said
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:46.480]  before history is looking at us history our children our children's children
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:50.960]  generations will talk about this about how we respond the demeanor and the
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:56.160]  discipline with which we respond there couldn't be more at stake right now I
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:01.160]  think that's the central thing that we need to do and get ready because I think
[1:50:01.160 --> 1:50:05.400]  that things are gonna get worse I think that they are gonna try to I believe
[1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:09.840]  they are going to charge Donald Trump and that will they are looking to cause
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:14.080]  mayhem they are looking to disorient people look if we look at what's been
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:18.600]  happening here right it's an intelligence operation insofar as they've
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:24.240]  wanted to destroy they've wanted to destroy Donald Trump they wanted to
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:28.160]  destroy the America first movement but running parallel there's been another
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:32.080]  operation too which is something of course you've been talking about from the
[1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:38.680]  beginning it's a large information operation it's a campaign of desecration
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:44.520]  demoralization destabilization they're looking to dispirate the American
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:49.680]  people they're looking to demoralize us that's what they want to do so the more
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:54.400]  and more that Americans can respond the Americans the Americans who believe in
[1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:59.440]  this country again the discipline the calm the demeanor with which we respond
[1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:04.600]  that will make us stronger it will make the country stronger as well I think
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:10.000]  that's the key fact don't be demoralized everything they're trying to do is to
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:14.280]  demoralize us whether it was COVID lockdowns whether it was burning
[1:51:14.280 --> 1:51:19.040]  burning down monuments during the George Floyd riots whether it's rewriting
[1:51:19.040 --> 1:51:24.280]  American history with the 1619 project they're trying to get their moralization
[1:51:24.280 --> 1:51:31.640]  they're trying to get us into a civil war absolutely absolutely and that's
[1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:38.000]  why I say the more calm we can show the more demeanor we can show we're not
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:42.360]  going to be lured into your garbage we don't believe in your idols the things
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:47.400]  that you believe in we don't believe in right it doesn't make us conservative or
[1:51:47.400 --> 1:51:51.640]  doesn't make us traditional or whatever it just makes us American these are
[1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:56.280]  American values right the more that we can show that I think the more that we
[1:51:56.280 --> 1:52:01.120]  can discipline ourselves to get through this right to get through it showing
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:05.040]  what American champions have shown from the very beginning from when the
[1:52:05.040 --> 1:52:10.840]  country was first settled these are what American champions look like but before
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:13.840]  I forget I just want to come back to some things it reminds me of what I'm
[1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:17.200]  saying reminds me of what you said in the very beginning at the top of the
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:21.240]  show when you were talking about the energy when you were talking about how
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:24.480]  they're trying to destroy energy infrastructure and this will hurt people
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:29.520]  from moving around you know it's not just about going to work in your car and
[1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:34.040]  it's not just visiting family and stuff like that but movement has been a part
[1:52:34.040 --> 1:52:38.600]  of has been a part of our has been a part of who we are as a movement is
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:43.920]  freedom movement is freedom exactly that's this is what teenagers understand
[1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:48.000]  you grow up and you get car keys and like you have freedom this is what we all
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:51.360]  understand look at look at all the look at all the great movies that are road
[1:52:51.360 --> 1:52:55.800]  pictures get on the road have to figure it out I have to fix myself I have to
[1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:59.840]  you know fix my family just get things in order and you go on the road you look
[1:52:59.840 --> 1:53:04.200]  at things Jack Kerouac wrote wrote one of the great American books about it on
[1:53:04.200 --> 1:53:08.520]  the road this is who we are so to try to take that to try to take that from us
[1:53:08.520 --> 1:53:12.920]  because this is part of it too again it's a campaign of demoralization you
[1:53:12.920 --> 1:53:16.520]  Americans think you're one thing you're not your garbage we're gonna take all
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:21.120]  these trying to break our will as a classic Tokyo Rose outside enemy would
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:25.120]  do and in the process Hollywood's destroyed itself the lefts destroyed
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  themselves they are committing suicide while trying to force the west to
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:34.000]  commit suicide all we have to do is not commit suicide and stay strong as the
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:40.280]  French say the best revenge is living well I agree absolutely and that's what
[1:53:40.280 --> 1:53:45.160]  I mean we have to it's a time for it's always a time for politics but it's
[1:53:45.160 --> 1:53:49.160]  especially a time for I think for people to go and build their families build
[1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.600]  their communities spend time that's the source of our strength that's the real
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:56.920]  source of our strength that's the source of our political organization totally
[1:53:56.920 --> 1:54:02.360]  agree and that's why that's why they said the churches can't be open but the
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:06.560]  liquor stores and Walmart can be yeah it's all a raw exercise of power to see
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:09.920]  what they can get away with because they know this big Ponzi scheme of the
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:12.720]  central banks is coming to an end and that's really why they're desperately
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:17.280]  testing everything they can to try to get a path to a permanent dictatorship
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:21.720]  so that we can't unseat them this is all a sign of weakness I totally agree with
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:25.760]  you only hit one final story here this is out of the Atlantic owned by the
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:30.680]  Jeffrey Epstein supporting widow of Steve Jobs and it says where does Alex
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:36.360]  Jones go from here and it says we can't stop him unless we arrest him we need to
[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:40.560]  put him in jail that's what the article goes into and that's really their
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:45.520]  answer is put their opposition in jail the ladies and gentlemen they fear
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.600]  info wars because we're a populist movement that tells the truth that's
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:52.560]  why they misrepresent what we've done and people need to see this as a real
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:56.440]  sign of how serious these people are because they have converted their
[1:54:56.440 --> 1:55:01.200]  average menu and they get some paycheck to actually believing we're Dr. Evil or
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:06.680]  we're the James Bond villain when Klaus Schwab of the New World Order these are
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:11.080]  the real James Bond villains and the average person is not buying them trying
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:16.280]  to cast us as the bad guys but again these reckless globalists don't know how
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:23.600]  to give up it's the default move of of mentally ill people all the time of
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:28.080]  dangerous mentally ill people I want to put my political opponents in jail lock
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:32.080]  them a lock them away throw them away that's the default move like you're
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:35.960]  we're watching you all the time here and your stuff on Klaus Schwab is great
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:40.400]  one of the things that gets me I can't believe this like we've been making
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:45.080]  movies about Nazi villains for how many decades now this guy dresses like a
[1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:50.000]  Nazi he talks like a Nazi he has ideas like ideas like a Nazi and no one else
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.480]  it's only a fraction of the population it turns around says this guy sounds like
[1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:57.440]  a Nazi it's ridiculous I can't believe the fact that this guy is getting away
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:02.960]  with acting like a cartoon figure of a Nazi and and and there are and hardly
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:08.240]  anyone else is pointing that out that's right alright Lee Smith people can find

[1:59:57.640 --> 2:00:03.880]  I don't know what will happen now we've got some difficult days ahead but I'm
[2:00:03.880 --> 2:00:12.840]  not concerned about that now I just want to do God's will and he's allowed me to
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:23.560]  go up to the mountain I've looked over and I've seen the promised land I may not
[2:00:23.560 --> 2:00:33.560]  get that with you but I want you to know tonight that we have a people who will get to the promised land
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:38.280]  gotta come together whether you believe it or not you got to decide whether you
[2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:42.360]  have to menu over yourself I believe that the majority of the plain people of the
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:46.800]  United States will day in and day out make sure the states in governing
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:51.440]  themselves than any smaller class or body of men no matter what they're creating
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:55.480]  will make in time together and you got to decide whether it's God that's gonna
[2:00:55.480 --> 2:00:59.840]  have to menu over you that you get orders from or whether some other human
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:03.840]  that's jacked into the evil force is gonna have to menu over you what we're
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:09.000]  talking about now is like a second industrial revolution but the product
[2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:14.680]  this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons the
[2:01:14.680 --> 2:01:18.760]  product this time will be humans themselves do we want to have a human
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:23.200]  plan or to post human plan Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:27.640]  humans are obsolete we're scum because they know we are their competition they
[2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:32.480]  know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have they can't compete
[2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:35.800]  with that transmission they can't compete with that blueprint they can't
[2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:40.680]  compete without architecture they can't compete with that master plan but I just
[2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:45.640]  see it now it'll be so clear soon are you pro-human or are you anti-human you
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:49.960]  are the human resistance to this alien takeover and again when I say alien
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:55.160]  takeover I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell
[2:01:55.160 --> 2:02:00.480]  from Alpha Centuries I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:06.600]  God's order and God's will or do you choose to serve the agents of death
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:10.160]  and like Martin Luther King said we're not gonna judge them off what color they
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:16.400]  are we're gonna judge them off of their character of their actions and deeds I'm
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:21.040]  gonna say it right now real clear I love everybody no matter what color your
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:25.280]  beautiful skin is what I care about your heart and your guts in your mind and
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:29.360]  you're under attack by these Satanists and they want to kill you and they want
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:34.760]  to kill your children and I say we set our differences aside and I say we come
[2:02:34.760 --> 2:02:39.240]  together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build
[2:02:39.240 --> 2:02:44.080]  the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity these
[2:02:44.080 --> 2:02:47.840]  enemies tell us all day about diversity they mean divided and conquered groups
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:53.080]  of people separate from each other this bill is supported by all of the
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:03:00.840]  Democrats House and Senate it's just a filibuster in a way so in a way if you
[2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:08.240]  really truly want to honor Dr. King don't dishonor him by using a
[2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:13.320]  congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy but I tell
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:17.200]  me if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for mayor Trump and you
[2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:25.440]  ain't black I want unity under a code of freedom and liberty and justice and
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:29.720]  coming together and working together and being strong and that's what info wars
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:36.160]  is and that's why the enemies of humanity hate us so much because we love
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:45.080]  God and God loves humanity and I am a human supremacist I am a human
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:53.360]  supremacist I am a human supremacist I am a human supremacist I am a human
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:03:59.200]  supremacist that term will be the future war with the robots and the AI what
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:03.120]  you're hearing now is the entire future and everything they tried to stop us
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:08.480]  from doing our supremacy will not end with this planet we will keep all the
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:14.160]  stars we will colonize we will green get worlds we will go interdimensional we
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:17.280]  will unlock the secrets of the universe God has laid them out like Christmas
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:21.840]  presents for his children and I am extremely honored to be in the fulcrum
[2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:28.960]  and the heart of the fight to bring our race the human race in a race for the
[2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:33.920]  future and we will break the enemy we'll break the pedophiles we will break the
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:40.240]  Satanist because God already sinned his own self down here to show us he could
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:44.560]  do it God would never ask us to go through an optional course he wouldn't go
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:48.080]  through and now we're gonna go through what Christ did and we're gonna go
[2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:53.760]  through it and we're gonna be destroyed but reborn on the other side
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:05:00.720]  Ladies and gentlemen if millions of people get this book our funding
[2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:04.240]  problems will be over and it's starting to happen that's why I said yeah go to

[2:06:02.320 --> 2:06:13.120]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:29.040]  alex jones
[2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:40.800]  the bible tells us over and over again that knowledge is power
[2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:44.240]  that the people perish for lack of knowledge
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:50.080]  and we see homeland security announcing that anybody that protests an election
[2:06:50.080 --> 2:06:53.520]  or forced injections is a terrorist anybody that doesn't want critical race
[2:06:53.520 --> 2:06:56.880]  theory talked to little children that they're bad because of what color they
[2:06:56.880 --> 2:07:00.560]  are is evil anybody that doesn't want five-year-olds taught to change their
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:03.520]  gender and have the state take over control their lives is bad
[2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:11.520]  and now 86,852 new irs agents on top of the massive build-up under the third
[2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:16.800]  administration of baroque saint obama through his puppet biden has been
[2:07:16.800 --> 2:07:24.960]  announced and it all ties together this image of a baseball stadium that holds
[2:07:24.960 --> 2:07:31.520]  87,000 people that's how many irs agents to harass you that they've set up
[2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:36.800]  for some of the other economic news egg prices in us jump 47 percent as food
[2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:44.720]  inflation hits highs not seen since 1979 facing russian gas cuts europe dims
[2:07:44.720 --> 2:07:49.360]  lights pools pools and shortened showers wall street journal it's a great reset
[2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:54.000]  you know nothing have nothing you like it robot arms are replacing shelf stockers
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:59.360]  how bad are your favorite foods for the environment scientists create impact
[2:07:59.360 --> 2:08:04.320]  scores for the carbon for 57,000 products they're going to put taxes on with beef
[2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:09.760]  topping the list is the worst and energy drinks as the best energy drinks is the
[2:08:09.760 --> 2:08:14.160]  best new york city secretly exports homeless to hawaii and other states
[2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:19.920]  without telling the receiving politicians look at this spin from cnbc
[2:08:19.920 --> 2:08:25.920]  consumer price rose 8.5 in july less than expected as inflation pressures ease a
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:32.480]  bit so record level inflation is easing a bit and i have a clip here in my list
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:38.080]  where biden says we've had zero inflation
[2:08:41.440 --> 2:08:44.880]  he means month to month he didn't go up this month which they're cooking the books
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:52.240]  anybody can tell you that so the reason i called our guest who's a lawyer and one
[2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:57.360]  of the top experts out there on the iris fraud the reason i got him on is not
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:00.480]  just because he's a sponsor i got him on obviously he's a respond to this
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:06.960]  this declaration of war but the people perish for lack of knowledge if you know
[2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:13.440]  how the code's written on average you can reduce your tax 50 60 70 80 legally but
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:17.760]  they don't want you to know that and they control the cpa's most of them they control
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:24.560]  the big tax preparing places by design to not even give you the deductions it's so simple
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:28.160]  but what's great about american tax solutions you go to jonestaxrelief.com
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:33.200]  follow the link that way we get the support sponsorship and they can literally
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:38.800]  whether you're a blue collar worker or whether you're a police officer or whether you're a
[2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:43.040]  person that owns a restaurant or a dental office or you're a professor or whether you're a millionaire
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:50.400]  the average person's paying 30 plus percent in federal tax and you don't have to jonestaxrelief.com
[2:09:51.200 --> 2:09:56.160]  but the reason i got him on today was to talk about this and just to see cutting off the energy
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:10:00.480]  cutting off the jobs shipping the jobs overseas they want to break us with universal basic income
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:04.320]  so they can control every aspect of our lives that's been announced that's here that ain't coming
[2:10:05.200 --> 2:10:11.840]  i've got dozens of reports i've even aired this week cbs nbc abc cnn msnbc german tv french tv
[2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:18.080]  british tv taiwanese tv microchips to buy and sell you get discounts on products we take a microchip
[2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:25.280]  they're rolling it all out in our faces because the average person that doesn't know the tax rules
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:29.520]  and it's similar in the uk and other places they write loopholes there as well they're totally legal
[2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:34.960]  if you don't know these you are going to be destroyed they're you're going to be bankrupt
[2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:39.200]  you're going to be shut down but if you do well you won't perish because you have the knowledge
[2:10:39.200 --> 2:10:46.400]  so my good friend tyler bennett joins us for the balance of the hour he's got a lot of key points
[2:10:47.120 --> 2:10:54.560]  he sent me three pages of notes he wants to go over these are all huge issues that must be discussed
[2:10:54.560 --> 2:11:03.200]  the irs is being weaponized democrats new army we're going to look at all of these points and
[2:11:03.200 --> 2:11:10.160]  the disarming of the american people and so much more and a steve bannon reported when i was on a
[2:11:10.160 --> 2:11:15.680]  show two days ago because he's a former big finance guy himself they got rid of attacks on
[2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:22.400]  billionaires in this bill this is targeting hardworking people this is to break your will
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:29.200]  just like the lockdowns were the toller bennett to talk about the 86 852 new agents this army
[2:11:29.200 --> 2:11:33.920]  you can't go to war without your armory can't go to war without your gun without your food without
[2:11:33.920 --> 2:11:37.520]  your leadership without your logistics we're not about physical war here it's a metaphor
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:44.880]  that's what jones tax relief com with american tax solutions can do and then it helps with the
[2:11:44.880 --> 2:11:49.680]  big sponsorship from the info war they save a ton of money and secure their family you guys
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:56.000]  can expand your operations to help more americans and we stay on air a 360 win-win solution so
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:00.960]  toller bennett great to have you on today where should we start well thanks for having me on
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:07.200]  again alex great to be on and i think the place we have to start is the obvious weaponization
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:12.800]  and politicalization of the irs right so it's interesting that biden is claiming there's no
[2:12:12.800 --> 2:12:18.080]  inflation when the act that the democrats just passed is called the inflation reduction act
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:26.480]  that is the act that provides for 87 000 new irs agents they like eight they're also gonna allocate
[2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:33.040]  80 billion dollars to the irs now here's the thing this is money that's not going to be used
[2:12:33.040 --> 2:12:38.400]  to go after the elitists the globalists the billionaires out there as you said in fact
[2:12:39.360 --> 2:12:46.560]  these laws provide more loopholes for the billionaires two ways one directly in the code
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:53.040]  but two whenever the government hires a massive amount of people we're increasing a bureaucracy
[2:12:53.040 --> 2:13:01.760]  correct and so by adding 80 000 people to the list now we're making it even easier for those with
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:09.040]  the fancy tax attorneys and lots of money at the top to escape and avoid paying income tax because
[2:13:09.040 --> 2:13:14.080]  the added levels of bureaucracy and complexity that's necessarily going to be added into the
[2:13:14.080 --> 2:13:21.120]  tax code by the creation of all these new jobs over at the irs so what's that mean well let's
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:27.680]  look at when this tax bill first got announced it was announced the same day that the fbi
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:34.400]  rated marlago right and why did that happen because that's much more of a sensationalist story
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.840]  and they're trying to go over under the radar about how they're coming after politically
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:44.240]  anybody who's you know supported the wrong regime that's who's going to get audited
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:52.000]  and they've specifically said anybody making over 28 dollars a day spending 28 dollars a day
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:59.040]  is subject potentially to these audits you know who's not going to get added is the upper class
[2:13:59.040 --> 2:14:06.720]  the elitist the globalist because simply adding people to the irs does not make that situation
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:12.240]  easier for them to rectify in fact it makes it more difficult but what it does make it easier
[2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:16.880]  for them to do is to come after the middle class to come after small business owners to come after
[2:14:16.880 --> 2:14:22.960]  people who made six hundred dollars on at sea or ebay right and try to close the tax gap that way
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:29.040]  instead of the way they should be doing it because the irs is their weapon and it's been politicized
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:35.200]  at this point and cutting off the pipelines and oil drilling all of it is admittedly to drive
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:39.680]  us into bankruptcy cloud and heaven so we'll accept all going basically on welfare we'll
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:43.920]  still have our jobs we'll still work but everything will be directed by them i mean this is just so
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:49.200]  damn criminal and and and so ballsy but it's being done all over the world by the un by the
[2:14:49.200 --> 2:14:55.440]  claus swab operation i mean this is a plan correct and and when you when you look at you know we
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:00.000]  see it out here in california a lot in other states as well and it's happening around the world
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:06.800]  but the idea of universal income the idea of handing out all these stimulus checks is obvious
[2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:12.400]  what the government's trying to do they're trying to make you me the people dependent on them and
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:16.960]  and it's works record numbers people won't work which then breaks down society more
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:23.920]  absolutely alex out here in california it's record of unemployment nobody wants to work
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.320]  because they just get get keep getting checks from the government
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:32.720]  etc but then the carrying capacity of the industrial base collapses society collapses
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:35.840]  and we have depopulation via starvation already happening in the third world
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:40.560]  howler Bennett stay there let's talk more about this legislation what it means and so much more

[2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:21.120]  world so you don't know what's going on call the experts they're ready to help you right now
[2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:28.640]  what are the services you offer alex so as you mentioned again the the same things that the
[2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:34.960]  elites use the globalists use to pay the least amount in taxes these options are available but
[2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:42.880]  what it comes down to is a lack of education the the those on the top do not want you educated
[2:22:42.880 --> 2:22:49.280]  and what you can do what you can form an entity a c corporation trusts other things so that you're
[2:22:49.280 --> 2:22:55.760]  make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes and providing for your family's future right and so
[2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:03.920]  the same exact things that the globalists use c corporations and trusts as well as llcs and
[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:11.200]  and the the idea here is you have you you have your your income and the more amount of separation
[2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:15.920]  we can put between that that's what protects you from the government and anyone else trying to
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:23.120]  take your money so the thing is is it's it's not your fault you went to school and nobody ever
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:31.200]  taught you how very it's you know arcane concepts in the tax law work that's why you need to hire
[2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:37.120]  somebody who knows what they're talking about and the tax laws change every regime and so it needs
[2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:42.560]  to be a constant someone who is up to date on the education we are here my attorneys are here
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:48.560]  and what we pride ourselves in doing is using the exact same loopholes in the exact same laws
[2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:54.480]  and entity structures and setups that the elitists use for the middle class so that you can be paying
[2:23:54.480 --> 2:23:59.680]  the least amount as possible and you've got every service people need to go through there's more
[2:23:59.680 --> 2:24:06.960]  than 20 services correct listen we we we operate in the past the present in the future and what
[2:24:06.960 --> 2:24:12.320]  I mean by that is if the IRS or the state is already coming after you they're claiming you
[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:16.720]  owe money maybe they're levying their bank out maybe they placed a lien on your property maybe
[2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:22.640]  they're garnishing your wages any of these things we can put a stop to it right away give me a call
[2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:30.480]  the present which is are you paying too much in income tax this year we can we can mitigate that
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:37.200]  and the future which is hey listen I plan on making more money next year than I did last year
[2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:42.880]  and I want to make sure that I'm in the proper entity setup whether that's a corporation
[2:24:42.880 --> 2:24:50.800]  an ass corporation an LLC a trust type setup so that we can form a tax plan for you so that you're
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:56.880]  paying the least amount going forward because remember you have to pay taxes that's the law
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:03.360]  but you the law is also in your right is as a taxpayer to not pay these this regime any more
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:08.640]  than you possibly legally owe them so that means pay them the least amount as legally possible
[2:25:08.640 --> 2:25:14.160]  because we know what they're doing with your money and it's not what you agree with again stop giving
[2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:19.200]  money away to people who hate you how does it work when they call for folks that don't know they call
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:25.360]  you talk to them it's attorney client privilege they give you their information you guys look at it
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:29.600]  you get a lot of calls so those takes a few days a week you look at it you say well this is the
[2:25:29.600 --> 2:25:33.520]  basic stuff you can do right now people are blown away but then they've got to implement
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:41.360]  correct so what we do is you call in and we'll give you a little consult just right on the phone
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:47.600]  for free about what we think you should be in entity wise and structure wise and and I should
[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:51.200]  say this is something that you're going to want to take care of you know sooner rather than later
[2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:57.120]  because the IRS attack is on its way and they are out to get you know you me and all the rest of
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:05.440]  the middle class taxpayers in this country and so give us a call we'll tell you what needs to happen
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:11.440]  and if you want to do it then we'll schedule another call and set it up for you implement it's very
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:16.080]  simple whether it's the open borders or turning off the energy or saying small businesses are
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:21.440]  non-essential are jacking up taxes on little people it is a war against the population and
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:25.760]  folks need to know this and not let them drive you into welfare when they have full control
[2:26:25.760 --> 2:26:30.000]  of your life with the force inoculations that is the end game that's their admitted plan
[2:26:31.040 --> 2:26:36.400]  100 alex so let me give you an actual example of one of your listeners called in last week
[2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:43.280]  cabbie from new york city guys making 30 000 a year the irs is auditing him because they're saying
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:51.440]  there's no way that he on 30 000 a year can pay for his wife and his infant child okay so does this
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:57.520]  person who's making less than 50 000 sound like the fat cats that's going to close the irs loop
[2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:02.400]  or is this the middle class that they're attacking because that's what they want to do
[2:27:02.400 --> 2:27:06.560]  and let me bring another point to the your attention i'm sure you've talked about is
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:14.000]  is as we all know the irs has just bought over 5000 guns and five million rounds of ammunition
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:21.440]  well think about this the military right buys lots of guns and ammunition because they use
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:28.560]  those guns and ammunition on the enemies of americans right the police who have guns and ammunition
[2:27:28.560 --> 2:27:35.600]  they use those guns and ammunition on criminals who are trying to kill or otherwise commit crimes
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:44.960]  against americans the irs is buying guns and ammunition to use against americans it's incredible
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:48.800]  you've got other issues we want to go over when we come back what are the other points you want to
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:58.320]  add well listen again as i as i like the stress is the big corporations at the top are floating by
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:03.680]  not gonna experience any of these audits because the irs has already said over 50 percent of the
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:10.400]  people they plan on auditing are making less than 75 000 a year and so what we want to do is make
[2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:16.400]  sure that if you're in that bracket you're set and you're ready for this oncoming irs attack
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:22.640]  before it happens because preparation is the name of the game here all right stay there we'll do one
[2:28:22.640 --> 2:28:27.600]  more segment with you because this is so important and then i meant to do this sunday i meant to do

[2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:31.440]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones so trump warned they were trying to
[2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:37.280]  set him up obama took 30 million documents and never gave one back to the next larkovs he can do
[2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:42.720]  that as president or his documents trump takes some documents they raid him with 100 swat team
[2:33:42.720 --> 2:33:47.200]  members and armored vehicles and a bunch of rider trucks haul it all away god knows what
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:51.520]  they'll add to it i've experienced them trying to frame us over and over again but because
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:57.600]  of god we've made it through it in your prayers but now newsweek reporting exclusive an informer
[2:33:57.600 --> 2:34:07.280]  told the fbi what dox trump was hiding and where oh isn't that just cute absolutely criminal
[2:34:07.280 --> 2:34:12.080]  desperation we're in the middle of a real coup
[2:34:13.760 --> 2:34:18.800]  color Bennett american tax solutions find the links we get the support there's their main site all
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:26.160]  their services just go to jonestaxrelief.com this is a patriot as an american patriot as a guy that
[2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:32.160]  fights this for you back at the irs and they're 87 88000 new people what do you make of what they're
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:39.840]  doing to trump and just all this craziness alex what this is is a direct attack on the american
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:47.120]  people and on conservatives in general obviously the regime had the final say on raiding trumps
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:52.720]  place or not right i mean that's no secret but here's what's happening is this bill which again
[2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:57.280]  they passed on the exact same day they raided trumps place hoping that people wouldn't pay
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:03.440]  attention to that but even this isn't a conspiracy even cnn is all up in arms over the fact that
[2:35:03.440 --> 2:35:10.560]  this bill is going to militarize the irs they are going to be now be fully armed and we talked about
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:16.560]  this before clerks not even lawyers who are going to make legal determinations about what you owe
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:21.200]  in taxes and let me tell you how this is played out already alex because as we know the great
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:28.320]  reset started with the covid-19 uh pandemic and what that did is that caused a lot of people
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:34.080]  that were uh employees right to either lose their jobs or end up working at home and they
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:42.480]  started becoming small business owners well in 2021 alex the irs collected more money than ever
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:49.760]  before ever and if we look at the last 30 years it's not from c corporations corporate corporations
[2:35:49.760 --> 2:35:53.760]  no matter what the corporate tax code they pay almost nothing in taxes all the time because
[2:35:53.760 --> 2:35:59.600]  they're able to write everything up where this is coming is from individuals that pay on 1040s
[2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:05.440]  and that is for one reason and one reason only the because these people that are now in small
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:10.560]  businesses that were used to being employees their whole lives are not taking the deductions
[2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:14.880]  that are legally available and let's just slow down and be let's be infinity clear here
[2:36:14.880 --> 2:36:21.200]  here the big mega banks and the big mega corporations the jeff bezos is the world
[2:36:21.200 --> 2:36:27.760]  they pay zero tax on average not just because they don't want to pay tax you pay tax they don't
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:33.040]  that is an unfair trade advantage this is how they're taking over that's why they doubled and
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:38.800]  tripled their wealth during the lockdowns on record is this is done literally to wage war
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:43.520]  on our communities on that little diner or the small car dealership or the small farm
[2:36:43.520 --> 2:36:48.720]  or the small private school or the small auto parts store which we all want to need
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:36:53.600]  and they know we want to go to the small people they know we don't like chains and so this is a
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:59.280]  way to eradicate that and that's why the small business person needs to do this is why i'm so
[2:36:59.280 --> 2:37:04.000]  frustrated it's like they're in a fight with a guy with a machine gun and i want them to at least
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:10.880]  pick up a sword they need to realize this is happening correct this is a situation where it's
[2:37:10.880 --> 2:37:16.080]  bringing a knife to a gunfight and as you said correct over the last three years corporate
[2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:23.680]  profits have skyrocketed they're higher than ever before but there is no more taxes
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:29.680]  coming from corporations to the irs the all the new surplus is from small business owners and they
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:34.320]  admit they don't investigate sorrows they don't investigate dark money they don't investigate
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:38.720]  political money unless it's conservative they want to bully little people they admit that
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:47.520]  that 100 percent because again to the elitists have such separation between their assets and
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:54.000]  income and themselves that it can be looked into if the irs wanted to expend a lot of resources
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:58.960]  and we can close the tap gap get tax gap that way but they don't want to do that what they've
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:04.320]  already said they're going to do is come after people making under seventy five thousand dollars
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:09.280]  a year because they believe they officially said we're going to get the tax money from below seventy
[2:38:09.280 --> 2:38:15.120]  five thousand i mean that is so dirty i mean that is insane it's almost as bad as shutting off
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:20.080]  the keystone pipeline i mean yeah they're out to get us and that's why i'm so frustrated folks
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:25.920]  learn the code get lawyers involved you think of lawyers as expensive tax lawyers are and cpa is
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:30.480]  not these guys these guys cut right to the chase and just deliver that that's why you've got to go
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:38.000]  to jonestaxrelief.com absolutely so another thing is when you hear about uh so biden has
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:42.560]  passed what's called the global tax rate for corporations right it's 15 percent now this
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:49.360]  is a giant red herring that again is designed to help you to facilitate you thinking that oh we're
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:55.120]  getting taxes out of the rich corporations we're not why the corporate tax rates 21 percent so they
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:59.760]  made a they made a global tax rate that is already less than what corporations pay you see how this
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:06.320]  is a red herring versus uh versus biden is actively out there trying to raise your personal tax
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:12.320]  from third highest income bracket from 37 to 39 percent and that goes all the way down that means
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:17.200]  if you're you know making a hundred thousand dollars right now paying 20 21 percent that's
[2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:22.720]  going to bump you up into 23 25 percent right and with inflation happening as i've explained
[2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:28.400]  multiple times yeah we all know as yeah as inflation happens you you may get pushed up and
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:33.840]  as you said the law and the code says this and they've got the nerve to say on cnn we're not raising
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:43.200]  taxes on blue color and white color workers when it says it absolutely it's um it's they say one
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:47.760]  thing look at my mouth speak so you don't see what my hands are doing it's a classic david
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:54.560]  blaine magician trick and here's the thing though so inflation is a two uh two-way sword and they
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:40:00.320]  have been using it to get more and more money out of us and make us weaker and weaker but here's
[2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:06.960]  something that we can also do and my firm can help you do this is those assets that you own that
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:12.560]  inflation is pumping up the value of not because they're worth more but because the dollar is worth
[2:40:12.560 --> 2:40:19.840]  less well guess what we can take a uh greater deductions against those types of things so give
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:24.720]  me a call because we can use inflation as a weapon now against the government because they've been
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:30.000]  using it as a weapon against us and it's time to fight back well you guys are the closest thing to
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:35.680]  a silver bullet and you guys can advise people and give them the very simple steps or people can be
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:40.640]  destroyed by the globalists everybody should go to jonestaxrelief.com they should call the toll
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:52.560]  free number 833-900-4285 and they should understand that this has been written to screw you this has
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:57.280]  been written that you don't know it and we're trying everything we do is about getting people to
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:01.840]  know the hidden knowledge getting people understand how it really works because that empowers the people
[2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:06.000]  and that derails the globalist agenda so even if you don't care about yourself and your family
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:10.960]  even if you don't want to save money you should do this so the globalists can't get away with this
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:15.280]  is why they keep changing the tax laws every two years because they know we figure it out and they
[2:41:15.280 --> 2:41:20.160]  jump but you've got to be every few years changing what you do or you're screwed it's that simple
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:26.240]  that's a hundred percent uh true alex and if we look at just the top fat cat corporations
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:31.200]  apple and amazon change their tax strategy every three to four years because they have to to make
[2:41:31.200 --> 2:41:36.560]  sure they're paying nothing in taxes now we're not super billionaire corporations so they have a
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:42.000]  little bit more power than they do but 99 percent of the tactics that these large corporations
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:49.680]  and globalists use to lower their tax liability you as an american taxpayer have access to
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:56.080]  and can use the thing is you just don't have the knowledge of how to do it we do we will teach you
[2:41:56.080 --> 2:42:01.760]  what to do and then if you'd like us to set it up for you we absolutely will because here's the thing
[2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:07.200]  is and i've said this before but i'm going to repeat it is the irs is they're coming after you
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:14.320]  they've weaponized they're basically turning into uh the the money military and the only way to protect
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:22.160]  yourself is to preemptively strike here and make sure you are in a situation where even if they come
[2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:27.920]  try to audit you or try to come take more money then they are legally entitled to well that's
[2:42:27.920 --> 2:42:32.160]  right that's right that's why i love you have the right people in your pocket that's why i love 360

[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:11.280]  yeah i feel ashamed of myself and i feel like a polycrap when i think about the fact not all
[2:48:11.280 --> 2:48:16.640]  the time but i feel like a polycrap right now that we've been diverted by their fake lawsuits
[2:48:16.640 --> 2:48:23.360]  against us and by marlago raids and by all this stuff that is important on the surface but not
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:34.320]  important in the aggregate because these shots don't work with their genetic therapies and they're
[2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:40.480]  causing mass death according to dozens of major insurance companies and news reports and so they're
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:50.000]  just normalizing mass death and so i pledge this to you yeah it's important they had a kangaroo
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.960]  trial for us yeah it's important the judge told the jury i was guilty yeah all that's unprecedented
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:59.600]  and dangerous but killing a bunch of little kids and and people with heart attacks and blood clots
[2:48:59.600 --> 2:49:08.000]  is even bigger and so they want to tie us down with all this garbage and distract us from our main
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:16.480]  mission exposing their biomedical attack on humanity so we're going to air these two reports
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:24.720]  back to back one is out of the local us news one is out of taiwan about what these shots are doing
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:30.720]  in live time and we reported this obviously the insurance numbers started coming out a year ago
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:38.320]  but it's all confirmed now let that sink in they know it doesn't work to protect from a virus
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:43.120]  they know it messes up your blood they know it causes strokes heart attacks heart swelling
[2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  cancer infertility everything else and they're doing it and it was in
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:55.920]  the october 2020 document from the cdc that they predicted this would happen
[2:49:58.640 --> 2:50:08.240]  let that sink in long and hard what type of maniacs are we dealing with here
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:14.320]  they just think they'll kill a bunch of us and cast and see if we wake up and now they want
[2:50:14.320 --> 2:50:18.400]  homeland security to make us take shots the us is the only country in the world that authorized
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:23.840]  six month olds and up to take the damn shot i mean this is crazy how will they kill americans
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:28.400]  have a virus released have a scare have forced inoculations and kill people
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:33.040]  and this is only the beta test can they kill three four percent of us
[2:50:33.040 --> 2:50:41.840]  and we put up with this the sky is the limit in taiwan the number of people dying after the
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:47.920]  jibby jab is exceeding the number of deaths from the virus itself expert insurance companies
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:54.640]  expect insurance companies to sue vaccine manufacturers to cover payouts for explosion
[2:50:54.640 --> 2:51:01.680]  of early unexpected mortality claims ohio medical student died suddenly due to heart
[2:51:01.680 --> 2:51:06.640]  issue during three-day bike ride for cancer research there's hundreds of these today this
[2:51:06.640 --> 2:51:11.840]  incredible clip listen to this this is why a pharmacist are not warning people about
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:21.280]  what the vaccines are doing some report getting monkeypox which is that scientists on about
[2:51:21.280 --> 2:51:29.040]  at receiving first dose of vaccine wcvb polio is spreading in britain for the first time in 40
[2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:39.440]  years health officials launch urgent jab rollout think about that so let's do this let's air the
[2:51:39.440 --> 2:51:44.400]  taiwan clip the us clip and then let's air the lady playing the clip of the pharmacist
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:49.920]  talking about what happened to this child that's in the hospital with a swollen heart
[2:51:49.920 --> 2:52:00.400]  heart i mean this is happening this is going on this is real and i just we have a bureaucracy
[2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:04.400]  not just cutting off our gas pipelines not just opening up our borders not just shipping and
[2:52:04.400 --> 2:52:09.840]  fentanyl not just teaching drag queen pedophile time not just devaluing the currency not just
[2:52:09.840 --> 2:52:14.160]  devaluing defunding the police not just george sorrell's taking over the district attorneys
[2:52:14.160 --> 2:52:20.080]  not just lawless crime and war but killing us with shots it's total war
[2:52:21.760 --> 2:52:29.200]  they are attacking us at every level every day and the longer we don't admit this
[2:52:29.200 --> 2:52:35.680]  the worse it's going to get let's play these reports back to back and we'll be back
[2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:40.800]  taiwan the number of people dying after their coveted vaccination is exceeding the number
[2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:46.320]  of deaths from the virus itself taiwan's health authorities say that as of monday deaths after
[2:52:46.320 --> 2:52:54.640]  vaccination reached 865 while deaths from the virus are at 845 vaccines currently offered in taiwan
[2:52:54.640 --> 2:53:02.320]  include astrazeneca moderna fizer biointech and taiwan's own vaccine menogen out of the 865 deaths
[2:53:02.320 --> 2:53:09.920]  after vaccination over 600 were from astrazeneca and nearly 200 deaths after moderna shot us life
[2:53:09.920 --> 2:53:15.040]  insurance companies have reported an overwhelming and unexplainable increase in all cause deaths
[2:53:15.040 --> 2:53:20.560]  among 18 to 49 year olds along with that there's also been an increase in certain medical diagnosis
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:26.080]  such as miscarriages and bell's palsy here to give us her take on the new data and what she
[2:53:26.080 --> 2:53:30.640]  believes could be causing the rise in numbers is emergency medicine and disaster specialist
[2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:36.480]  dr kelly victory doctor victory good morning great to talk to you as always good morning jason
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:40.960]  thanks for having me okay we want to make sure that anytime we talk we want to make sure the
[2:53:40.960 --> 2:53:45.920]  information that we have is accurate so let's start this interview by telling us i've i've
[2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:50.960]  seen your correspondence here what is the source of the information that you're about to present
[2:53:52.240 --> 2:53:58.720]  well this information became available to me or on my radar last week following a hearing
[2:53:58.720 --> 2:54:04.720]  with senator ron johnson uh who was looking at sort of what he calls a second opinion on the
[2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:13.440]  entire response to the covid pandemic the medical data was released by three career military physicians
[2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:21.280]  who got the information from the military database that collects what we call icd codes
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:27.600]  which are the diagnosis codes and these physicians had a feeling they believed based on their own
[2:54:27.600 --> 2:54:34.240]  observation that they were seeing a significant uptick in certain conditions so they actually
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:41.680]  went back and called the database from the military on certain conditions over a five year period
[2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:52.080]  from 2016 through 2020 notably you continue containing one year 2020 of the full blown
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:55:00.000]  pandemic so they looked at 2016 1718 19 and 20 at the prevalence of certain conditions including
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:06.400]  things like heart attack blood clots to the lung miscarriages those sorts of things and they compared
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:14.560]  it to the incidents of those same things in the calendar year 2021 and saw an alarming increase
[2:55:14.560 --> 2:55:24.000]  in certain things for example they saw a 270 increase in myocardial infarction in 2021 a 300
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:32.080]  percent increase in incidents of bell's palsy and a certain neurologic complaints a 470 percent
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:36.800]  increase in pulmonary embolisms this is a conversation of a dad
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:48.240]  yeah are you a pharmacist yeah i've got a question my waist up against my wishes brought my son
[2:55:48.240 --> 2:55:55.360]  seven-year-old son in various reports right a few days ago for a coded job and he's now in the
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:56:03.280]  hospital with myocarditis and i was obviously not very happy with you guys or with my wife
[2:56:04.640 --> 2:56:10.320]  she told me that she was not told that was a potential side effect why so why wouldn't you
[2:56:10.320 --> 2:56:25.040]  have told her that no it's not because i've been doing research it's common in the u.s there's tens
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:30.960]  of thousands of them reported to the cdc saying so why are you not telling parents this were you told
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:39.200]  you got the jab were you told and they don't want to get their child vaccinated yeah so so
[2:56:39.200 --> 2:56:42.960]  you don't want to scare the parents with something that is actually happening
[2:56:42.960 --> 2:56:48.640]  that's happened to my kid are you out of your mind you don't want to see them you need to give them
[2:56:48.640 --> 2:56:53.840]  the right information so they can make a proper decision what is wrong with you you don't want
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:59.760]  to scare them i'm recording this conversation as well and this is going to a lawyer next thank you
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:05.520]  for admitting that so why don't you tell them when someone comes in there and says hey what can go
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:10.880]  wrong what do you say sore arm have you seen the amount of dead people have you seen it
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:15.440]  has we all have asked before giving consent to give
[2:57:16.080 --> 2:57:21.120]  she has side effects are does she ask i'm not sure because i wasn't there
[2:57:22.160 --> 2:57:28.080]  you're supposed to tell people this can happen no i can't so you know what the prognosis is
[2:57:29.200 --> 2:57:35.280]  you know what it is possible death within five years 20 percent of people with myocarditis die
[2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:45.280]  it is a permanent damaged heart it is not temporary because of you because you didn't want to scare
[2:57:46.240 --> 2:57:51.600]  you don't know people say alex jones crazy he's a conspiracy theory guy's a nutcase he got these
[2:57:51.600 --> 2:57:58.960]  rants and all that uh what they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different

[3:01:43.200 --> 3:01:48.560]  point we're at right now everything i do isn't perfect but it's from a position of trying to
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:52.880]  empower you and empower others because if you're not empowered i'm not going to be empowered
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:02:00.480]  and we have a dumbed down deceived public controlled by evil none of us have a future
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:07.360]  but when we bet on humanity when we bet on the future and when we bet on god we win so please
[3:02:07.360 --> 3:02:12.320]  again realize we've been totally vindicated so have you supported this broadcast the new world
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:18.480]  order just like we said is there in spades crazier than ever making its move man it's wild
[3:02:18.480 --> 3:02:24.480]  and it's hard to believe and a lot of people are going to have mass Stockholm syndrome they're
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:28.480]  going to decide deep down they're scared or they're going to run to the system and grovel to it
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:35.360]  but they'll be destroyed the best position is fighting back the best position is trusting in
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:42.800]  god the only position is saying i'm going to do what's right and i'm going to stand against evil
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:49.200]  and that means being extremely aggressive in the information war that means taking the
[3:02:49.200 --> 3:02:53.680]  articles the videos the reports the live feeds and sharing them on your email and your text message
[3:02:53.680 --> 3:02:57.840]  one of the few areas they're not totally censoring and to go out on the mainline internet and say
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:02.640]  here's the forbidden show here's what you're not supposed to hear because we know we've got the
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:09.840]  answers because the enemy hates us more than anybody and the enemy can't believe we're taking
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:15.280]  the fight to them and they can't believe we know their plans they are completely polaxed
[3:03:16.400 --> 3:03:22.000]  they are dumbfounded they are cross-eyed because they're the losers that signed on with the devil
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:26.720]  we're the winners that signed on with god and so just remember that and god's going to test us but
[3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:32.800]  as long as we realize this life is so short there's only a test we're going to make it through this
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:40.080]  together so thank you all for your steadfast support of this imperfect operation but our
[3:03:40.080 --> 3:03:46.800]  will is real and our intention to do good is real and our plan to tell the truth is real and it has
[3:03:46.800 --> 3:03:54.800]  borne the most devastating truth against the enemy thank you all for your support don't wait

[3:05:00.800 --> 3:05:07.680]  collapse in the strange space between what we've known and what's to come and right now the most
[3:05:07.680 --> 3:05:14.560]  important thing to remember is don't panic stay calm because now is the time that we must get our

[3:06:02.240 --> 3:06:06.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show thanks alex i'm k dally from k dally radio
[3:06:06.800 --> 3:06:11.920]  and the k dally show and i can't wait to spend this hour with you i have a simple question
[3:06:11.920 --> 3:06:17.680]  let's just start let's just start out with a simple question why what is the reason for the gas prices
[3:06:17.680 --> 3:06:23.440]  today what is the reason that they're giving you right now as to why the gas prices are high
[3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:28.960]  you don't have a reason there's no explanation right i mean russia was in the spring they blamed
[3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:34.640]  russia okay got that um even though we only get five to seven percent of our our oil from there
[3:06:34.640 --> 3:06:40.720]  hmm and so we knew that didn't work out we also of course they used covid last year we know that
[3:06:40.720 --> 3:06:45.920]  sniffles you know sniffles is very crafty super crafty and uh it can do a lot it can
[3:06:45.920 --> 3:06:51.360]  perform a coin shortage it can perform high gas prices it can perform a you know shortage of oil
[3:06:51.360 --> 3:06:58.240]  shortage of food all kinds of things everything was blamed on covid so what's the reason
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:05.520]  there is no reason you're supposed to just go yes that's how it is yes that's what's happening
[3:07:05.520 --> 3:07:12.240]  why did trump get rated nothing to see here right of course not i actually have a great
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:16.880]  piece of info on that i'll share with you in just a second but i have a lot of questions today
[3:07:16.880 --> 3:07:21.200]  and i hope they make us all think a little bit more because isn't that what we're supposed to be
[3:07:21.200 --> 3:07:26.720]  doing last time i checked i always thought we were supposed to be um people that were critical
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:32.320]  thinkers right and so there are things that are abnormalities that we must discuss and so i'll
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:37.280]  bring some things up today i hope uh i hope it really kind kind of shines a light if you will
[3:07:37.280 --> 3:07:42.000]  on on certain things but i got an email and the email you might have had one of these instances
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:47.600]  happen to you i get these all the time same email uh where they say you know i agree with you but then
[3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:53.760]  when you said this well you're a conspiracy theorist that's a conspiracy theorist now it's
[3:07:53.760 --> 3:08:00.480]  meant to be a dig truly it's meant to be something that's an insult right it's also meant to be a
[3:08:00.480 --> 3:08:08.880]  conversation stopper why why so i wrote back of course i i can't always write back but it just
[3:08:08.880 --> 3:08:13.520]  so happened i had some time i could do it and so i wrote back and i said you know from from your email
[3:08:13.520 --> 3:08:21.920]  i'm guessing that that's a dig right i mean i can just point something out right i mean certainly
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:27.040]  you can just listen to that but i think what you're really trying to say is that i've said something
[3:08:27.040 --> 3:08:34.080]  that you don't agree with or makes you uncomfortable right maybe it isn't true maybe it is but there's
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:40.080]  certainly a reason i'm bringing it up and you called me a conspiracy theorist but oddly enough
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:47.440]  when you wrote me you didn't debate the theory why i think that's uh kind of intriguing honestly
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:53.920]  when i hear something that i'm not sure about i think about it i assess it i challenge it
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:58.560]  that but you didn't do any of that this is what i wrote this guy but you didn't do any of that you
[3:08:58.560 --> 3:09:03.200]  took the time to write me which i do appreciate because i do to basically just tell me that i'm
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:10.320]  not supposed to bring up theories that you don't agree with so whenever i see inconsistencies in
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:18.720]  logic i feel like it would not be honest if i didn't bring it up i am neck deep deep in research
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:25.280]  all the time and what's interesting about that is that i i'm i'm sifting through history and i'm
[3:09:25.280 --> 3:09:32.160]  sifting through documentation and i'm sifting through their own admission right and so why wouldn't
[3:09:32.160 --> 3:09:37.280]  you want to give it a listen why wouldn't you even want to know what i had to say and then assess it
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:45.760]  think about it at least entertain it i don't just grasp it straws usually when i bring something up
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:50.880]  there's usually a reason and it's because in my research i've come to all kinds of conclusions
[3:09:50.880 --> 3:09:56.240]  that it just doesn't make sense so there has to be another reason for for what we're talking about
[3:09:57.200 --> 3:10:03.760]  i know the presidencies are controlled they have been for 120 years started with kernel house behind
[3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:09.120]  wilson that's why they have the right left parties that's why they each have their tribute
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:13.200]  i'll call it a tribute they each have their hunger games they each have their candidate
[3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:19.440]  those are the only two that you get to have on the stage they're vetted and they pick which one
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:25.520]  they want to roll with but usually about every eight years they have to switch parties because
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:30.160]  well you have to appease the people people have to feel like they're kind of winning
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:35.040]  and that's just the deal which is what they do so every eight years team a team b you know
[3:10:35.040 --> 3:10:42.560]  whatever is going to placate the masses and so who is they right who are the people that control
[3:10:42.560 --> 3:10:47.760]  things there's a lot of people you have the think tanks you have a lot of people that were in office
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:52.320]  you have your dick chinese and your john carries and all these different people that sift in and
[3:10:52.320 --> 3:10:56.880]  out of government right and your unelected bureaucrats in think tanks and they make these
[3:10:56.880 --> 3:11:02.800]  very very big decisions on policies they write all the bills your congressman doesn't your senator
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:07.680]  doesn't that's why when those come you know uh they haven't even read them when they say it's
[3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:12.480]  three thousand pages they haven't even read the one they said they wrote so the think tanks are
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:18.160]  doing all of that and then on top of that you have the cia the pentagon the folks at the un the imf
[3:11:18.160 --> 3:11:23.600]  the folks that run the wef not all the folks in those organizations but i'm sure a pretty good
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:32.880]  smattering of them kissinger kissinger is three foot two he's still alive good gravy uh the rock
[3:11:32.880 --> 3:11:37.760]  of fellers the cfr you have many many people remember when hillary called them the mothership
[3:11:38.720 --> 3:11:44.160]  these people run the country so when we say they there's a lot of people involved in this
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:50.720]  why do they do it for profit there's a lot of profit globally where you might not get that
[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:55.920]  from just good ol america you might be able to siphon a lot of tax dollars off put them into
[3:11:55.920 --> 3:12:00.880]  ngo's and all kinds of organizations around the world and you might be able to siphon off money
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:06.720]  for you know that's why we have the emissions the emissions test that is because that money
[3:12:06.720 --> 3:12:13.920]  from 1995 on drove the money to the un to pay for the un so we have all of these people
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:18.160]  that really run the house and really control things it goes deeper than that that's a whole
[3:12:18.160 --> 3:12:23.600]  other show though i'm sure uh and the families that are not discussed the very very very rich
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:28.160]  families that are never discussed so there's a lot of people at the helm a lot of people i
[3:12:28.160 --> 3:12:35.520]  didn't mention um but it's controlled and there's a lot of evidence to support that
[3:12:36.720 --> 3:12:41.440]  and of course this is why even though we have a majority of conservatives in the country
[3:12:41.440 --> 3:12:47.600]  they're always going to make the races look really tight i mean really margin then how is that possible
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:53.680]  it's a numbers game if most of the country is conservative which they are you only have about
[3:12:53.680 --> 3:12:59.760]  30 total wackadoodle so you've got about the majority of the country right so why are the races
[3:12:59.760 --> 3:13:04.720]  airtight doesn't make sense how could that be and then people come back with well the cities you
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:12.480]  know the well i'm sorry but population still the population all over the uh states so there's no way
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:18.320]  could ever be razor thin all of the time hmm maybe that's where the fraud comes in you think
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:23.200]  so critical thinking doesn't mean you're a conspiracy theorist it means that you assess
[3:13:23.200 --> 3:13:31.920]  logic motive versus perception media sound bites versus outcomes and guess what there's
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:37.680]  a whole lot of false flags going on there just is and they've been going on for a long time
[3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:42.000]  and they've been getting away with them for a long time although they're getting kind of nervous
[3:13:42.800 --> 3:13:46.800]  because they might have overplayed their hand in some of these because they're too obvious
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:55.040]  yes so now they're sending clear messages right january 6 is uh don't protest and then you have
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:14:01.840]  then you have uh the raid so if it can happen to the president it can happen to anyone isn't
[3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:08.480]  that the messaging of course and you're not supposed to really look at right what's right
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:13.280]  in front of your eyes you're not supposed to see that you're supposed to hear what they're
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:16.080]  telling you and when you hear what they're telling you they're telling you a different
[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:22.800]  story than what your eyeballs are seeing but you're supposed to believe it so if you have one question
[3:14:22.800 --> 3:14:28.560]  in an event or an occurrence okay you could debate that what about a hundred abnormalities
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:35.440]  that make no sense and are not logical then it's probably a false flag but they're really
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:41.440]  worried about the people rising up in mass they really kind of want us to come out one at a time
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:46.400]  you know and they can play you know you know a ping ball you know ping ping ping you can ping
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:51.760]  them out of existence right but what they what they don't want is the masses so that's why
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:58.240]  they're sending these very clear messages it isn't about whether or not an incident or event anymore
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:05.760]  is a conspiracy now it's about how deep does the theater go you have critical thinkers and you have
[3:15:05.760 --> 3:15:11.680]  their brainwashed right and those people like somebody to do the thinking for them it's why
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:16.480]  they get all their thinking from the mass media they don't have to go on a limb out on a limb
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:21.040]  they're lazy right they can't assess information they can't compare logic to what's being presented
[3:15:22.560 --> 3:15:27.200]  so when i see someone call somebody a conspiracy theorist all i'm thinking is you the lazy brainless
[3:15:27.200 --> 3:15:34.000]  twit i'm trying to be nice it doesn't come out that way ever probably i just get bored i'm bored
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:39.520]  with people like that people need to be challenged and we need to help them be challenged in their
[3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:46.560]  thinking do not back down do not stop talking about false flags ever do not stop they need to be
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:53.040]  discussed they need to be debated and they need to be exposed i'll be right back i'm k deli your

[3:20:11.840 --> 3:20:15.920]  welcome back to the alex jones show and kate dally your guest host from the kate dally show
[3:20:15.920 --> 3:20:20.880]  i'm so glad to be with you today hope you're having a great summer i i know it's stressful
[3:20:21.920 --> 3:20:25.280]  i don't know how i mean i don't even know what to say about the headlines anymore
[3:20:25.840 --> 3:20:30.160]  but i do want to share an interesting piece of information with you and a hat tip to george
[3:20:30.160 --> 3:20:36.720]  web on this in october of 2021 he did a series of new shows on the little known us state department
[3:20:36.720 --> 3:20:42.560]  diplomat named matt pottinger um that had joined donald trump's national security team as a deputy
[3:20:42.560 --> 3:20:49.280]  advisor for peter navarro and he had profiled matt pottinger as the kissinger kid we were just
[3:20:49.280 --> 3:20:53.440]  talking about kissinger three foot two kissinger is any about three foot two now i'm pretty sure
[3:20:53.440 --> 3:20:59.520]  um so primarily uh because his father this guy matt pottinger his father stanley pottinger
[3:20:59.520 --> 3:21:07.120]  was the key man in coming up with deep throat in watergate and so uh to take out richard nixon
[3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:11.920]  one of the reasons they also took out richard nixon was because he uh imprisoned alger hiss
[3:21:11.920 --> 3:21:15.600]  too and they didn't like it that was like a little payback a little vengeance for you
[3:21:16.320 --> 3:21:23.200]  and so um uh as president with mark felt of the fbi so the mad at the metadata rule was in effect
[3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:26.960]  and so if your father takes out a president the son is likely to do the same thing
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:33.120]  hmm linden larouche had out the connection between kissinger and the hatchet man stanley pottinger
[3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:38.800]  in one of his executive intelligence briefings decades ago but kind of interesting that the
[3:21:38.800 --> 3:21:46.880]  son ended up there we also have uh questions about where was the sheriff i haven't heard heard good
[3:21:46.880 --> 3:21:54.640]  things about that particular sheriff rick bradshaw um over there uh in uh trump territory over at marlago
[3:21:54.640 --> 3:22:03.760]  was it to keep january 6 in the headlines for the election was it they're so desperate for
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:07.840]  information on january 6 because they have nothing that they're willing to maybe even
[3:22:07.840 --> 3:22:14.560]  go plant evidence just a question just a question and what about the secret service where were they
[3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:21.680]  hmm and the judge who provided cover for ebbstein and garland signing off and chris ray who hates
[3:22:21.680 --> 3:22:25.520]  trump i mean it's all very very interesting when you put all the pieces together right
[3:22:25.520 --> 3:22:29.920]  it doesn't take a whole lot of assessing to figure out what's going on here politically
[3:22:31.040 --> 3:22:39.840]  yeah so the fbi can be bought politically controlled politically perfect so we also
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:44.960]  have the dissident and farming reduction act that i wanted to bring up for just a moment
[3:22:44.960 --> 3:22:51.840]  and most of the 740 billion dollars went to global warming so basically what they want to do is cut
[3:22:51.840 --> 3:22:56.640]  out the uh cut out more emissions than they already have so the farmers up in canada were
[3:22:56.640 --> 3:23:02.240]  saying well wait a second wait a second uh we already cut emissions 30 for you even though
[3:23:02.240 --> 3:23:07.760]  it's absolutely asinine we already did that no they want more and the only re the only way to get
[3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:18.560]  more is to do what cut out farming all together this is such a demolition of our of of our country
[3:23:18.560 --> 3:23:26.560]  of our resources i can't even fathom how anyone could come up with a reason as to why this is
[3:23:26.560 --> 3:23:36.800]  happening other than a manufactured demolition so this is okay well let's just say this let me
[3:23:36.800 --> 3:23:43.920]  just ask this question if you're 60 years of age or younger you have been hearing about climate
[3:23:43.920 --> 3:23:50.960]  change your entire life how have you actually been affected by it in your life in your 30s in your
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:58.480]  40s in your 20s in your teens i mean when were you affected by it can you give an instance
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:06.400]  can you tell anyone how this has affected you or is it always ahead of us how convenient
[3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:11.200]  after 60 years it's still ahead of us and it's always at the end of the decade i love that part
[3:24:11.200 --> 3:24:15.520]  because you know you can't really die off at the beginning of a decade you got to have 10 years 10
[3:24:15.520 --> 3:24:20.160]  years gives you gives you enough time to pass bills where it's fresh on everybody's mind for
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:26.560]  taxation and regulation and to absolutely cut down the food supply but if you did 20 years see if
[3:24:26.560 --> 3:24:31.440]  they said 20 years you'll be an icicle you know you'll be an icicle or you will be uh a fried egg
[3:24:31.440 --> 3:24:38.640]  on the sidewalk well yeah people forget yeah it's not an emergency 10 years yeah 10 years works they
[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:43.840]  found that out so that's why you're going to die at the end of every decade due to climate change
[3:24:43.840 --> 3:24:49.680]  and like dan pina says it's not a fart in the wind this is simply whatever you're trying to do your
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:54.080]  little plastic bag your straw whatever it is whatever these people are doing i know it's not you
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:58.080]  but the people out there whatever they think they're doing to solve the earth crisis that they
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:04.960]  think is happening isn't a fart in the wind love dan pina so it's a lie told every decade it's
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:09.440]  cyclical whether it's cyclical 400 to 600 year cycles you can't change it just like you can't
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:13.440]  change the sun coming up in the morning you just simply can't there's nothing you can do
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:21.920]  and doubling the size of an of the irs go look at the largest football stadium right uh that you
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:28.640]  can fathom right now and imagine it filled with people to the brim for a really good game and
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:38.880]  that isn't even 87 000 new agents well they're not going after the wealthy they're basically going to
[3:25:38.880 --> 3:25:44.720]  be coming after the middle income earner and uh and this controlled demolition makes way for the
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:49.600]  great reset we all know that right you've been hearing this over and over again because it's
[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:55.680]  true the great reset is coming what we need is the great resistance we truly need the great
[3:25:55.680 --> 3:26:02.480]  resistance and so we know that businesses will only get loans if they abide by the crazy lies of
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:08.880]  the green agenda but they're going to move forward and it's complete lawlessness it's just complete
[3:26:08.880 --> 3:26:16.320]  lawlessness and excuses you know every single i don't know people realize this but almost all
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:21.040]  because i've done the research on this almost all of the three letter agencies that are that
[3:26:21.040 --> 3:26:28.240]  are constantly in the press right you have the fbi the cia the fda the cdc um nyh all of these
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:35.760]  were all built on a lie they had to be because americans thought we were in a free country that
[3:26:35.760 --> 3:26:41.040]  why would we need an agency over all the territory all the territories are covered
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:47.360]  by local police in america all of them there isn't a place where you can't find a local
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:52.640]  policeman who covers the area even a volunteer why do you need a federal police department
[3:26:54.160 --> 3:26:59.680]  so even them even they started on a lie and it was well you kind of need us well why why do we
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:09.120]  need you oh we're gonna we're gonna investigate immigrants for being dissidents or you know crazy
[3:27:09.120 --> 3:27:15.360]  really is that your job or we're going to you know they gave themselves a couple of innocuous
[3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:19.840]  jobs like these things that could have totally been covered in fact they said we're the new
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:25.440]  investigators for all of the deceit and crime that's going to go on in washington really i think
[3:27:25.440 --> 3:27:29.600]  you just were providing cover i don't really think that you were actually investigating anything
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:36.240]  and do we have so much of that going on in the turn of the ninth of the 20th century in the 1900s
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:40.960]  that you would need a full-time force for that of course you wouldn't of course you wouldn't
[3:27:40.960 --> 3:27:47.920]  have asked me to think that but that was the story and then they grew from there the epa
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:53.200]  started from an oil spill in 1966 in santa barba and all of a sudden that oil spill could have
[3:27:53.200 --> 3:27:58.000]  resolved itself and gone to gone to court no of course not you know what they had to do
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:02.400]  they had to bring in the epa and it was ready to go in six short months that's how quick that
[3:28:02.400 --> 3:28:09.120]  happened 10 000 employees so all of these different um all these different entities you know when the
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:14.480]  fbi started it was kind of amazing they really didn't have a lot to do they really didn't have a
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:20.080]  lot to do so what was the big thing that they they they hung their code on it was basically
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:24.640]  we helped with the mob with prohibition and you don't think local cops could have done that
[3:28:25.280 --> 3:28:30.800]  of course they could have these little lies were told all the time and then the lie sticks
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:36.080]  and it never goes anywhere and then what what do they do they build themselves up credibility
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:41.920]  because they own the media and the media does exposes and they even say the word celebration
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:49.600]  we celebrated the fbi we celebrated having the cia well when you're writing the script what else
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:55.280]  is it gonna say right oh dear i'll be right back k dally show i have some questions for you

[3:33:02.800 --> 3:33:15.680]  alex jones welcome back to the alex joke show and i hope you're having a good afternoon i'm kate
[3:33:15.680 --> 3:33:21.120]  dally your guest host i was talking about three letter agencies they sort of cropped up um at
[3:33:21.120 --> 3:33:26.400]  a time when you would think now wait a second why did why did we need them and before i get into
[3:33:26.400 --> 3:33:32.880]  some questions for you the nih when they came along uh that was i think the late 1800s and
[3:33:32.880 --> 3:33:41.440]  basically they wanted to be in charge of um looking at immigrants for diseases like yellow fever
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:49.040]  in cholera so we instituted the nih why couldn't doctors do that why couldn't your country doctor
[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:55.760]  go over there and do that oh no you can't have that so they needed an entire government arm right
[3:33:56.560 --> 3:34:02.240]  okay why was the secret service devised really i mean i know the the spy rings everything became
[3:34:02.240 --> 3:34:07.680]  the secret service but the secret service was actually created by way of department of treasury
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:13.680]  in 1865 to investigate counterfeiting so i have a question how much counterfeiting was actually
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:25.040]  going on in 1865 really okay was the fda put in for cover for pharma so that you wouldn't uh
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:29.680]  you wouldn't they wouldn't demonize the chemicals they started using in the mass production of food
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:35.520]  that was late 1800s early 1900s we started getting our food mass produced and then of course we
[3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:41.200]  needed an fda to control the narrative they had to control the narrative so that you wouldn't blame
[3:34:41.200 --> 3:34:48.000]  pharma oh no you would just blame the companies that were using some of these chemicals on the food
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  right but never a segue into really looking at pharma it was actually pretty crafty you got to
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:35:00.800]  give it to them and public health public health was started on a lie that said that down deep in
[3:35:00.800 --> 3:35:06.640]  the south they had to solve hookworm well it was already being solved there was no reason for these
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:14.720]  guys to do this but they they staked their claim on something that they did that wasn't necessary
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:21.680]  and that they said we needed and then we got public health isn't that interesting so here's
[3:35:21.680 --> 3:35:27.120]  some questions for you because i i think just kind of wrapping our brain around some of these
[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:33.760]  things that have happened in the past and currently really need to be investigated truly you really
[3:35:33.760 --> 3:35:41.760]  need to think about them right the cia did they continue their eugenics program i mean my gosh
[3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:48.720]  operation paperclip wasn't it when we brought all the nazis over why did we do that by the way
[3:35:49.600 --> 3:35:56.560]  why did we do that and then put them in the head of nasa like warner von braun and and and make them
[3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:02.320]  not only not only citizens but part of the creations of everything that was going on
[3:36:02.320 --> 3:36:10.080]  in america at the time was it just a continuation of eugenics probably like i said earlier why are the
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:16.240]  gas prices why are they high today there's no explanation why are people still thinking there's
[3:36:16.240 --> 3:36:22.560]  a coin shortage no explanation nothing they can't even give them with a straight face i was at a
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:27.600]  walmart and i was checking out and you know the doofy cashier you know not they're not all doofy
[3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:34.080]  but this one was and uh and i said why why why why do i have to use a card and they said coin
[3:36:34.080 --> 3:36:42.320]  shortage i said well what how why because covid well why why cuz covid i mean that is it the
[3:36:42.320 --> 3:36:46.640]  sniffles i mean we why do why do we have a coin shortage they couldn't answer it they got really
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:51.600]  flustered walked away because they repeat media sound bites people repeat media sound bites
[3:36:51.600 --> 3:36:56.480]  because they sound good but they don't make sense they just sound good right food shortages
[3:36:56.480 --> 3:37:02.160]  no explanation is it natural or created how do you go from what we were at two years ago
[3:37:02.800 --> 3:37:06.960]  to what we see coming right now to the farmers warning us that in about a year
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:16.320]  or or less six months we're not going to have much um that had to be done you can't just have
[3:37:16.320 --> 3:37:21.280]  that happen that there was nothing on the planet earth that would have made that happen right
[3:37:21.280 --> 3:37:29.520]  right so if you look at the anti-war movement the hippies right where the hippies are creation
[3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:36.560]  where the hippies uh an extreme version it reminds me today of the january 6 right uh
[3:37:36.560 --> 3:37:41.520]  because what are they doing they're demonizing they're demonizing patriots to make them look
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:47.360]  like they're violent thugs are crazy why is that did they do that with the hippies too
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:51.520]  did they take a section of hippies and and claim them to be the charles manson type
[3:37:52.160 --> 3:37:58.080]  you know the violent thug dirty i mean they were they went hippie but they went to the extreme
[3:37:59.440 --> 3:38:04.960]  very interesting i've done a lot of work on the 60s lately and a lot of things came out of the 60s
[3:38:04.960 --> 3:38:12.000]  i think we're not aware of west nile i got another notice uh in my town about west nile so i started
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:15.520]  doing some homework because the article was full of fear you're gonna have west nile you're gonna
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:21.520]  have west nile it's coming we just identified it did you know they played that exact headline
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:30.720]  for about the last 15 years every august every single august we've had the same headline
[3:38:32.160 --> 3:38:36.320]  it's amazing they can get away with it isn't it why are utility rates soaring
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:43.280]  no explanation think about it why are they soaring what's going on right there's no reason
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:50.160]  when they want to add government housing there's no scarcity of anything right when they want to
[3:38:50.160 --> 3:38:56.960]  do what they want to do there's no scarcities you guys remember in 2020 we had all the signage
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:04.000]  in shortages we had a shortage of toilet paper but we had all the signage in the world ready
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:11.760]  to go for social distancing and for covid awareness how was how did they do that with all those so
[3:39:11.760 --> 3:39:16.720]  called shortages how'd they have all the masks ready to go how were they able to manufacture
[3:39:16.720 --> 3:39:24.720]  vaccines with shortages that were affecting you and i no explanation you'll never get one
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:31.840]  biden's approval rating do you really believe it's in the 30s no explanation they got to keep it
[3:39:31.840 --> 3:39:43.440]  somewhat high right they have to the war in ukraine okay why what's it for is it still going on
[3:39:43.440 --> 3:39:48.240]  there's an awful lot of opportunities for stars like shan penne to go over there's a lot of
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:55.040]  opportunities for them to take a you know vogue photo shoot sounds like they're really really
[3:39:55.040 --> 3:40:00.720]  in the middle of a war right and so you know we've got a lot of money laundering going on over there
[3:40:00.720 --> 3:40:10.160]  i think allegedly hmm kind of interesting maybe we uh move locations because it's obviously going
[3:40:10.160 --> 3:40:17.920]  to go back to russia right but you have to keep a war in the headlines why because there has to
[3:40:17.920 --> 3:40:22.960]  be some sort of reason they can't just stand there and say nothing so what do they say russia
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:29.840]  china threatening to shoot down polosi all i kept saying was well do what you gotta do
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:35.440]  you know go ahead china i mean whatever um why would you send somebody that's completely hated
[3:40:35.440 --> 3:40:40.480]  in our country and then threaten to shoot the plane down nobody would care it'd be ridiculous
[3:40:41.440 --> 3:40:47.040]  everybody hates eyebrows to heaven she's she's bizarre i think even her own can't stand her
[3:40:47.040 --> 3:40:56.080]  she's like a little chihuahua she never stops ankle biting okay so china's in our pocket right
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:01.840]  we're besties having a fake fight our government is subservient to china and just asked joan hunter
[3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:10.720]  right just asked kissinger who started puckering up uh in 1971 and on to make sure that uh we were
[3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:15.600]  locked up with china and that anybody that entered office had to be okayed by kissinger because you
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:23.520]  know you gotta be subservient to china how is it that kissinger never had a stroke or a heart attack
[3:41:23.520 --> 3:41:31.280]  or gets fake coveted or hmm presidents had it like multiple times right king fraud a lot
[3:41:31.280 --> 3:41:37.760]  hmm interesting that kissinger never gets a thing so no explanation as to why russia's always the
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:47.840]  bad guy no explanation at all from those that uh that think that uh trump got in from russia if
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:54.400]  trump those that believed that trump got into office because of russia for four straight years
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:42:01.920]  right well then why didn't russia help him for a second term it makes no sense i remember on the
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:06.240]  air saying wait wait a second what would be the advantage what's the advantage you gotta show you
[3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:10.480]  gotta show the the motive and then you have to show the result it was never a result
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:17.040]  do they ever talk about that of course not that's yesterday's news don't be bothered by that
[3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:24.240]  right pence history pence came out and said don't look backward why just look forward at the elections
[3:42:24.240 --> 3:42:33.280]  work harder pence the sellout always the sellout and why did the fbi raid trump but let hillary go
[3:42:33.280 --> 3:42:40.800]  for the same charge mishandling paperwork right because it's politically charged and their own
[3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:48.320]  and all they're doing is really showing their hand at how corrupt they truly are so my grandmother
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:42:54.000]  always used to say when somebody shows you who they are believe them so believe them i'll be right
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:59.360]  back and k dally your guest host on the alex joke the great reset in the war for the world

[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:15.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show so glad you're listening so glad you're tuned in right now
[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:20.480]  i'm k dally your guest host from the k dally show so happy to be with you i have so many questions
[3:47:20.480 --> 3:47:26.320]  these are things i'm always thinking about always wondering about curiosity should be the one quality
[3:47:26.320 --> 3:47:34.080]  that we all endeavor to have more of curiosity because what has the last say uh i don't know 50
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:38.880]  50 years i'm going to get i'm going to say 50 60 years been about it's been about squashing
[3:47:38.880 --> 3:47:45.200]  curiosity this is why the news started telling you how to think about the news giving you your
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:49.680]  opinion in the news rather than just telling you the facts they had to because they had to
[3:47:50.320 --> 3:47:55.600]  they had to do it for you and we liked it that's the worst part we actually really liked it
[3:47:55.600 --> 3:48:02.320]  i like it when someone does my thinking for me so why did we need a un i mean at the close of
[3:48:02.320 --> 3:48:08.880]  world war two why did we need that if we were done and victory had been had i have a lot to
[3:48:08.880 --> 3:48:14.800]  say about world war two but not in the show today but why why is that why is that why why did we
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:21.040]  need it it's funny how we get all this superfluous stuff that we don't actually need why do we keep
[3:48:21.040 --> 3:48:26.160]  saying the word pandemic if the only people that die are at the hand of the icu in the icu
[3:48:26.800 --> 3:48:32.480]  and given experimental drugs why aren't they ever to blame hmm so why do we keep saying the word
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:39.440]  pandemic pandemic is when people fall dead around you it isn't when people die in the icu no explanation
[3:48:40.880 --> 3:48:46.880]  why are companies still eligible for ppp loans because of covid it's been two and a half years
[3:48:46.880 --> 3:48:51.600]  i don't know how much longer they can milk it but they certainly are what happens when you sign on
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:57.600]  these ppp loans though have you read the fine print i have the fine print means that the government
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:49:05.200]  now has a stake or a claim in your business they actually can control what you do and uh i think
[3:49:05.200 --> 3:49:10.240]  you should read the fine print if you're thinking about signing on for a loan for that why would we
[3:49:10.240 --> 3:49:15.360]  need to double the size of the irs like i mentioned before if you if you thought of the the biggest
[3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:22.400]  stadium for a football game uh ever then we still that still would not represent probably the 87 000
[3:49:22.400 --> 3:49:29.280]  agents right okay so if the wealthy they say they're going after the wealthy and to improve customer
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:35.280]  service do you need 87 000 agents for that this was the reason they gave improved customer service
[3:49:35.280 --> 3:49:42.880]  of course and of course you know going after the wealthy wink wink but the wealthy are less than five
[3:49:42.880 --> 3:49:50.160]  percent why would you need 87 000 new agents if you're really concerned about going after the
[3:49:50.160 --> 3:49:57.840]  wealthy you ought to think about that the wealthy supply the jobs but that's the kind of idiocy you
[3:49:57.840 --> 3:50:03.600]  get right when when they want to go after us but they can't tell us they can't give us a reason
[3:50:03.600 --> 3:50:09.200]  so now that's why it's just you know to improve customer relations i think uh the irs is going
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:16.240]  to look a lot more like the fbi rate on trump's home definitely so why is there never a media report
[3:50:16.240 --> 3:50:22.880]  that says that we need to abolish the cia why is the media never said this in the existence of of
[3:50:22.880 --> 3:50:29.440]  mankind our media has never said hey why do we have a cia and why don't we abolish them or hey i think
[3:50:29.440 --> 3:50:36.480]  the fbi is too much power now you know who controls them now you know who their baby daddy is it's
[3:50:36.480 --> 3:50:43.280]  because they're the ones that pay them that's why money filters down isn't that interesting you've
[3:50:43.280 --> 3:50:50.400]  never heard that ever those agencies don't have any oversight really and even when they do what
[3:50:50.400 --> 3:50:55.920]  do we get the joke kangaroo court trial stupid and they'll get they sit there and they say yeah
[3:50:55.920 --> 3:51:04.720]  they lied doesn't even matter nothing happens to them all right so why hasn't anyone ever done an
[3:51:04.720 --> 3:51:11.520]  in-depth report on exactly where the money goes when they do their ever famous omnibus bill the
[3:51:11.520 --> 3:51:15.600]  omnibus bills are large large bills they cram everything together and that's why they call them
[3:51:15.600 --> 3:51:20.560]  the pork filled bills because everything in their dog is in that bill and that's how they get it to
[3:51:20.560 --> 3:51:26.400]  sell through why hasn't anyone really ever said okay this is exactly down to the penny where this
[3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:33.120]  amount went and this amount went and this amount interesting you've never seen it and they have
[3:51:33.120 --> 3:51:38.240]  a black budget they can't discuss anyway right why do they have a black budget doesn't that just
[3:51:38.240 --> 3:51:47.280]  scream corruption okay and so you have 700 billion 700 billion do you know several years ago
[3:51:47.280 --> 3:51:52.400]  everybody was screaming because there was a bill that was 400 billion isn't it amazing how the numbers
[3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:58.240]  have doubled tripled quadrupled in the size and the amount of money that they're basically printing
[3:51:58.240 --> 3:52:04.320]  isn't it amazing that no one ever talks about it i remember the amount was the big headline the
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:10.640]  amount not anymore the amounts are never the headlines anymore it's just a given you're
[3:52:10.640 --> 3:52:17.920]  supposed to just accept it why hasn't any member of congress ever gone after the omnibus bill itself
[3:52:17.920 --> 3:52:22.640]  and said no more omnibus bills so they could be accountable for everything they spent because when
[3:52:22.640 --> 3:52:27.440]  they want to sail through an omnibus bill they just tell us it's for the military and what are
[3:52:27.440 --> 3:52:32.720]  most americans going to say oh well the military yeah we need that of course that's how they get it to
[3:52:32.720 --> 3:52:43.280]  go all right um okay so when everyone was in uh well lockdown i could talk about lockdown but
[3:52:43.840 --> 3:52:48.640]  you know it is interesting that when you go back to the vaccine it was already in production
[3:52:49.440 --> 3:52:56.240]  before they named covid how do you have a cure before you actually have the thing that you're
[3:52:56.240 --> 3:53:01.600]  trying to cure how does that work in backwards world i guess that makes sense in backwards world
[3:53:01.600 --> 3:53:07.760]  uh they admitted that the vaccine went into production in february they didn't even really
[3:53:07.760 --> 3:53:14.240]  name covid 19 it was still the mystery disease it was corona virus remember but they already wanted
[3:53:14.240 --> 3:53:19.520]  a vaccine why a vaccine is the answer why not let it play out a little bit and just see what's going
[3:53:19.520 --> 3:53:25.040]  on you know see it that's the sniffles which it's really flu cold and pneumonia but you know you're
[3:53:25.040 --> 3:53:32.080]  not allowed to say that it's fake it's covid's a name so why is that why did they do that and they
[3:53:32.080 --> 3:53:37.520]  didn't even care that they put it out there in the press they didn't even care they wanted you to know
[3:53:37.520 --> 3:53:42.400]  that they had already started manufacturing a vaccine because in order to get all of those
[3:53:42.400 --> 3:53:48.720]  vaccines they had to get it going and so of course they already started that and the patents for those
[3:53:48.720 --> 3:53:58.000]  vaccines were done what before 2017 by maderna that's a little creepy okay and when they said that uh
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:05.360]  they found the experimental drugs right that would cure it in the hospital we only had 15
[3:54:05.360 --> 3:54:09.600]  deaths attributed to covid at the time how did they have enough test subjects to even study
[3:54:09.600 --> 3:54:15.120]  anything to even put anything in trials the answer is they didn't they didn't do anything
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:19.280]  he came out he said remdesivir is going to be the thing no one questioned it he even said he
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:23.760]  didn't know if it would work just to give himself you know plausible deniability didn't matter
[3:54:25.200 --> 3:54:30.640]  yeah why do we need a huge vaccination program in the in the united states when we have amazing
[3:54:30.640 --> 3:54:37.440]  sanitation it doesn't really make sense does it why does a free nation have a federal public
[3:54:37.440 --> 3:54:45.280]  health department isn't that what occurs in in socialism of course why do we have a public
[3:54:45.280 --> 3:54:50.320]  health department the states the states can clearly the counties can clearly help themselves
[3:54:51.040 --> 3:54:57.120]  why do you need a top-down central agency to do it there's never been an answer for that ever
[3:54:58.640 --> 3:55:02.800]  why are they showing us that biden is such a joke and can't read from a teleprompter
[3:55:02.800 --> 3:55:08.240]  they obviously want us to see it every single day they want that to be the news they want to
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:13.360]  keep us divided they want us to be thinking the president is just incompetent it's not
[3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:20.720]  incompetent it's a coup it's fraud it's not just incompetence but they want you to just keep saying
[3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:28.000]  oh that moron which he is but that's truly what they want you to concentrate on right it softens
[3:55:28.000 --> 3:55:33.440]  it a little it's like oh he's just a moron no he's not just a moron it's a coup that's much
[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:41.120]  different that's treason and who did that cia courtesy of all of our intelligence agencies
[3:55:41.680 --> 3:55:43.920]  and the powers of b that run this country
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:52.160]  you know when we got the stimulus money too you know they gave us little sections of stimulus
[3:55:52.160 --> 3:55:58.400]  to keep us happy and complacent bread and circuses isn't that just fascinating that they can get away
[3:55:58.400 --> 3:56:03.600]  with doing that give you a little you know here's not quite your mortgage but here's some help
[3:56:03.600 --> 3:56:09.360]  and then turn around and take trillions trillions and that's why i go back to why isn't anyone
[3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:17.840]  talking about the amounts of money why it doesn't make any sense right there are so many questions
[3:56:17.840 --> 3:56:24.320]  there are so many things that cannot be answered at all and i think one of the things that we
[3:56:24.320 --> 3:56:29.760]  need to do as a populace is start really trying to figure out why are they pushing cannibalism
[3:56:31.120 --> 3:56:36.560]  why are they making it seem like it's super fun and inviting have you ever thought that
[3:56:36.560 --> 3:56:43.280]  in a million years of course not why are they pushing it what are they doing why did they never
[3:56:43.280 --> 3:56:50.880]  end the tsa why are they doing still the three ounces of liquid that wasn't even utilized
[3:56:51.440 --> 3:56:59.520]  in 9 11 why are they doing it i had to go for my feel up pat down uh the other day and uh when
[3:56:59.520 --> 3:57:04.800]  i was flying and i just stood there and thought i can't believe this is our country i seriously
[3:57:04.800 --> 3:57:11.360]  can't believe it but if we don't start really questioning everything as an entire nation it
[3:57:11.360 --> 3:57:16.960]  won't stop and we are the only answer because it's not going to happen in washington they're too
[3:57:16.960 --> 3:57:22.000]  bought off the intelligence agencies are bought off everybody's bought off so we're going to
[3:57:22.000 --> 3:57:29.040]  have to work together and be the very thing they fear which is the masses they really
[3:57:29.680 --> 3:57:36.000]  fear numbers of people i can't stress that enough and they keep showing you they fear it
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:40.720]  because they're sending these very loud messages to us don't talk about conspiracies right because
[3:57:40.720 --> 3:57:45.600]  they're not conspiracies they didn't happen of course they did i'm k dally your guest host for
