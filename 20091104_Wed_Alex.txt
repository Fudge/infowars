[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:36.820]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.820 --> 00:41.380]  ladies and gentlemen we're gonna have wide open phones with a full four hours
[00:41.380 --> 00:47.980]  today we have Dr. Rima Labo and Major General Stubblebine joining us in the
[00:47.980 --> 00:51.420]  third and fourth hour today but we'll have open phones when they're on with us
[00:51.420 --> 00:57.260]  for your questions about the flu about the eugenics mass extermination plan we
[00:57.260 --> 01:01.580]  can even ask us General Stubblebine about the book men who stare at goats made
[01:01.580 --> 01:05.660]  into a major movie with George Clooney and others that he has stated is a
[01:05.660 --> 01:10.620]  basically disinformation I'll bring that up just because that movie beliefs
[01:10.620 --> 01:13.460]  coming out this Friday but hasn't already come out I've just seen the ads
[01:13.460 --> 01:17.700]  everywhere the last the last month our good little buddy John Ronson wrote that
[01:17.700 --> 01:25.700]  book he also wrote them which is dark satire and I'm one of the main or the
[01:25.700 --> 01:31.020]  main character in the book and that was his first book on conspiracy theorist he
[01:31.020 --> 01:37.500]  made the five-part miniseries for international television airing in the
[01:37.500 --> 01:43.500]  US England Europe you name it called secret rulers of the world and in it he
[01:43.500 --> 01:47.460]  makes fun of us for believing in the world government he has since then
[01:47.460 --> 01:51.740]  recanted on this radio show and on coast-to-coast AM and others and said
[01:51.740 --> 01:54.700]  no he was wrong there is a world government and a lot of what the
[01:54.700 --> 01:58.260]  conspiracy theorists have to say is true in fact I've been forgetting let's get
[01:58.260 --> 02:05.700]  John Ronson back on let's get Ronson on I why not just get him on but side
[02:05.700 --> 02:12.620]  issue just thought I would think aloud here on air with everyone the his book
[02:12.620 --> 02:18.180]  was optioned not just Ministry of Goats but them was optioned by a major
[02:18.180 --> 02:26.620]  Hollywood outfit and they are yet to make a movie out of that I I wonder who
[02:26.620 --> 02:33.060]  they're gonna get to play good old Alex Jones Jack Black is set to play that
[02:33.060 --> 02:36.620]  part but you know they option a lot of books and and and don't turn them into
[02:36.620 --> 02:41.060]  movies but it certainly ups the chances that they are because they've turned
[02:41.060 --> 02:51.060]  Ministry of Goats into a major huge big budget film but maybe I should not be
[02:51.060 --> 02:55.460]  too pleased about that maybe I should hope that they don't make them because
[02:55.460 --> 02:58.620]  can you imagine what they're gonna make me look like a complete clown probably
[02:58.620 --> 03:06.860]  oh that's another issue I talked to Jesse Ventura last week and Time Warner
[03:06.860 --> 03:10.140]  that's putting out his TV show on true TV hasn't wanted to do any interviews
[03:10.140 --> 03:15.260]  until the third it's now the fourth so we're gonna be getting him on sometime
[03:15.260 --> 03:19.900]  next week he kicked it off with the promotion of his new TV show on Larry
[03:19.900 --> 03:26.740]  King live last night and Jesse believes this is gonna be more than just a fair
[03:26.740 --> 03:31.540]  presentation he believes this is gonna be the first national television program
[03:31.540 --> 03:37.420]  with his perspective where he believes the conspiracy theory and believes that
[03:37.420 --> 03:42.460]  he goes out and proves them he looks at both sides but he's telling me that it's
[03:42.460 --> 03:48.700]  going to be fair I don't know how that's gonna happen with Time Warner but we
[03:48.700 --> 03:59.020]  have the intro to the TV show I'm gonna be playing that later in the broadcast and
[03:59.020 --> 04:04.900]  he intros it by saying you don't think conspiracies are real they are and I go
[04:04.900 --> 04:11.060]  out and prove it and I was a consultant on the show and it looks more than fair
[04:11.060 --> 04:15.380]  it looks like it's slanted towards reality towards our side but I know Time
[04:15.380 --> 04:18.580]  Warner's got their hands in it and they're still editing some of it it's
[04:18.580 --> 04:25.700]  they starts premiering December 2nd starts premiering December 2nd and then

[08:36.100 --> 08:43.940]  things that'll blow your mind I've been on the inside and now I'm ready to talk
[08:43.940 --> 08:59.460]  and we're live later on prisonplanet.tv we're gonna go live at 12 30 central
[08:59.460 --> 09:03.780]  standard time an hour and a half into the show I will play some promo clips
[09:03.780 --> 09:12.820]  from the TV show and this television program is from Ventura's perspective
[09:12.820 --> 09:21.500]  that it is real and that the New World Order is real and eugenics is real and
[09:21.500 --> 09:29.460]  harp is a weapon that there is mind control that there are secret societies
[09:30.700 --> 09:36.260]  we will see what happens but again in the past the mainstream media wouldn't
[09:36.260 --> 09:40.340]  let anything like this on television and they still produce hit pieces every
[09:40.340 --> 09:43.460]  month that we see demonizing conspiracy theorists and people that question
[09:43.460 --> 09:49.180]  world government but now with thousands of publications a month I mean it's
[09:49.180 --> 09:53.060]  thousands sometimes it's thousands a week we've live on television here and on
[09:53.060 --> 09:56.900]  the radio typed in the term New World Order clicked news on the search engine
[09:56.900 --> 10:02.460]  and it's been 12,000 articles with New World Order in global government in it
[10:02.460 --> 10:07.580]  in one week a few months ago with the G20 it's over a thousand every week right
[10:07.580 --> 10:13.620]  now I've seen it over 12,000 articles in one week because the first Google
[10:13.620 --> 10:20.700]  News Block will be the last seven days over 12,000 admitting everything we've
[10:20.700 --> 10:25.700]  ever said but saying it's good see the only difference is we said it was real
[10:25.700 --> 10:31.020]  detailed the architecture of the system and said it was bad they now have
[10:31.020 --> 10:35.900]  reversed themselves and are admitting it's all real but are saying it's good
[10:35.900 --> 10:42.180]  Ventura comes out and says it's bad and I guess the television networks are
[10:42.180 --> 10:47.540]  desperate for ratings so they'll allow some of this on air I don't know we'll
[10:47.540 --> 10:52.420]  see what is going to happen with this I know Jesse's a good guy I know he has a
[10:52.420 --> 10:56.860]  good heart and I know he's learned a lot we've taught him a lot he's come a long
[10:56.860 --> 11:02.220]  way a couple weeks ago the last time I was in Los Angeles shooting a couple
[11:02.220 --> 11:12.220]  final clips for the television program we were talking at the hotel the night
[11:12.220 --> 11:16.900]  before a shoot and he said Alex I lay in bed every night now and for the first
[11:16.900 --> 11:21.620]  time in my life my mind just spins and everything's opening up and I'm learning
[11:21.620 --> 11:26.460]  so much so fast and you know I didn't think a lot of this stuff was real but
[11:26.460 --> 11:31.300]  now I'm wondering how deep the rabbit hole goes and that's the experience that
[11:31.300 --> 11:38.140]  we all go through so I'm very very excited about this television program on
[11:38.140 --> 11:43.860]  true TV it's a small series seven parts a big one would be 14 parts a regular
[11:43.860 --> 11:48.780]  series is about nine and I hope it's a good TV show I hope it gets picked up
[11:48.780 --> 11:54.780]  again for a second season obviously because I'm gonna be involved in it
[11:54.780 --> 12:06.460]  but very very exciting okay I'm gonna go into that a little bit more later in my
[12:06.460 --> 12:13.300]  stack of news GOP sweep big brother victories
[12:13.300 --> 12:28.540]  GOP sweep big brother has a big fat victory that's my Freudian slip because
[12:28.540 --> 12:37.780]  that's the truth am I saying it's a bad thing that Republicans won in Virginia
[12:37.780 --> 12:50.820]  and New Jersey no am I saying it's a good thing no it is a sign of desperation
[12:50.820 --> 12:57.020]  by the American people the Republicans have incredibly low approval ratings and
[12:57.020 --> 13:03.420]  so do the Democrats the media always spends it says oh Obama's not worried
[13:03.420 --> 13:08.140]  about the races in Virginia and New Jersey Democrats are going to win there
[13:08.140 --> 13:18.860]  this isn't going to be a sign that his star has fallen this isn't going to
[13:18.860 --> 13:25.620]  signify that he's in trouble even if they do lose but of course that's a lie
[13:25.620 --> 13:30.020]  that's spin it does signify that Obama's in deep trouble but that doesn't
[13:30.020 --> 13:33.820]  matter because he's a puppet of the private Federal Reserve Goldman Sachs
[13:33.820 --> 13:40.180]  JP Morgan Chase cartel the good news in all of this the silver lining is that
[13:40.180 --> 13:45.340]  it shows that the people are not happy with the system but again the system is
[13:45.340 --> 13:51.780]  broken and so it's only going to create more frustration and anger George Bush
[13:51.780 --> 13:57.260]  eight years of nightmare policies massively unpopular Obama is swept into
[13:57.260 --> 14:03.380]  office he breaks every promise he made brings in even bigger government than
[14:03.380 --> 14:07.380]  George Bush spending more money than Bush spent in eight years in the first
[14:07.380 --> 14:13.380]  ten months on almost impossible feet now the public's even more panicked
[14:13.380 --> 14:18.580]  their savior didn't pan out and they figured out in only a few months that
[14:18.580 --> 14:22.740]  this was a scam that's the good news previously it'd take three four five
[14:22.740 --> 14:27.140]  six years for folks to figure out it took people five years to figure out the
[14:27.140 --> 14:35.300]  George Bush was a complete criminal in a front man a puppet and a globalist and
[14:35.300 --> 14:41.220]  so now we have to ask ourselves what is going to happen when Republicans are
[14:41.220 --> 14:47.620]  swept into the house in mass in the 2010 congressional elections when they
[14:47.620 --> 14:52.540]  retake the Senate retake the house that's probably going to happen just like
[14:52.540 --> 14:59.620]  it did in 1994 as a backlash against Bill Clinton the problem is they will put
[14:59.620 --> 15:04.260]  somebody in there a CFR globalist like Newt Gainrich who will pose as a
[15:04.260 --> 15:10.980]  conservative and will lead the Republican takeover down the globalist
[15:10.980 --> 15:17.140]  rattle and then two years later the Republicans will be in trouble and
[15:17.140 --> 15:22.100]  Obama will be in trouble and so it will be a neck-and-neck race by two different
[15:22.100 --> 15:28.660]  groups of insiders that's why we need Ron Paul to be positioned to win the
[15:28.660 --> 15:33.700]  Republican nomination because he's going to be the only Republican who is
[15:33.700 --> 15:38.860]  truly populist truly constitutional and has any chance of beating Barack H.
[15:38.860 --> 15:44.700]  Obama if we get Mitt Romney he's a total globalist stooge total establishment
[15:44.700 --> 15:49.140]  person he will completely sell us out while giving us a bunch of constitutional
[15:49.140 --> 15:54.860]  rhetoric he will go 180 degrees the opposite direction from his rhetoric
[15:54.860 --> 16:03.980]  just like Obama does it is that simple and so big brother had a victory in
[16:03.980 --> 16:09.300]  Virginia and New Jersey but the actual headline of the Associated Press is
[16:09.300 --> 16:19.580]  GOP sweep big brother victories in Virginia and New Jersey GOP sweep big
[16:19.580 --> 16:25.340]  governor victories in Virginia and New Jersey but you can change that to big
[16:25.340 --> 16:28.900]  brother victories because when you look at both these candidates they are
[16:28.900 --> 16:38.300]  establishment types but it does show that it's not taking the people years to
[16:38.300 --> 16:42.660]  figure this out now and that's why the establishment is militarizing the police
[16:42.660 --> 16:46.300]  that's why all your local county and city police departments sheriff's
[16:46.300 --> 16:50.500]  departments are being federalized that's why the Mayak and Homeland Security
[16:50.500 --> 16:55.580]  reports confirm what we already knew that Homeland Security and Northcom have
[16:55.580 --> 17:00.340]  been set up for gun owners veterans conservatives in the Fed protesters in
[17:00.340 --> 17:07.700]  the Fed movement people because we are the real threat libertarians true
[17:07.700 --> 17:13.580]  conservatives veterans and gun owners people that don't like the Federal
[17:13.580 --> 17:18.740]  Reserve and know it's a corporate cartel that has illegally hijacked our
[17:18.740 --> 17:23.860]  nation and is bankrupting it by design that's even in a incredible article in
[17:23.860 --> 17:28.900]  the Clatchy newspapers I just can't get over how incredible this article is
[17:28.900 --> 17:33.100]  detailing how they imploded the economy by design how Goldman Sachs did it to
[17:33.100 --> 17:36.620]  plunge the housing market so they could repossess homes and so they could run
[17:36.620 --> 17:39.820]  their competition like Bear Stearns out of business I mean it's everything we
[17:39.820 --> 17:49.460]  cover and fall the Republic detailed in mainstream news from Goldman Sachs
[17:49.460 --> 17:54.820]  internal documents they got internal memorandum and prospectus that they were
[17:54.820 --> 18:00.860]  giving to high-level investors two years before the plunge last fall and
[18:00.860 --> 18:08.620]  winter this is three years ago these rats were setting this up and why not
[18:08.620 --> 18:12.660]  they have every major federal regulator they're the head of the Security
[18:12.660 --> 18:16.020]  Exchange Commission former Goldman Sachs the head of the New York Fed former
[18:16.020 --> 18:21.580]  Goldman Sachs the current head of the Fed former Goldman Sachs the boss of the
[18:21.580 --> 18:25.620]  White House economic team Larry Summers former Goldman Sachs Robert Rubin
[18:25.620 --> 18:31.060]  above him former Goldman Sachs Henry Paulson former head of Goldman Sachs
[18:31.060 --> 18:37.260]  every stinking one of them Mayor Bloomberg former Goldman Sachs one of
[18:37.260 --> 18:42.540]  their chief analysts and strategist and designer of the current computer
[18:42.540 --> 18:47.340]  systems they use to rig the market why do you think the Bloomberg so rich it
[18:47.340 --> 18:53.260]  could spend over a billion dollars on his last three campaigns because the guy
[18:53.260 --> 18:57.940]  invented the software they used to swindle the system I mean these people
[18:57.940 --> 19:03.260]  are incredible master criminals that make the Joker of DC Comics look like a
[19:03.260 --> 19:10.180]  choir boy and look at them they've got complete control of our society and
[19:10.180 --> 19:16.380]  they've got a military and paramilitary police force ready to take the American
[19:16.380 --> 19:22.260]  people on if we ever try to remove these criminals so I'm gonna get into GOP
[19:22.260 --> 19:27.980]  the sweet big governor victories in Virginia New Jersey but Gibbs said that

[24:13.580 --> 24:20.980]  shown their hand big time they've gotten behind schedule mounting resistance to
[24:20.980 --> 24:26.020]  globalization is intensifying on a planetary scale so they decided to
[24:26.020 --> 24:31.500]  bum rushes to move with all their assets at once to try to pass their takeover of
[24:31.500 --> 24:35.140]  health care their global carbon tax their banking takeover their
[24:35.140 --> 24:40.260]  federalization takeover their police state takeover their takeover of the
[24:40.260 --> 24:43.580]  schools everything is happening now their takeover of the internet
[24:43.580 --> 24:50.660]  mainstream news again today that Obama Northcom and the NSA are taking over the
[24:50.660 --> 24:57.660]  internet right now to shut it down unspeakably horrible things are
[24:57.660 --> 25:01.820]  happening but what do you expect living inside the new world order the good
[25:01.820 --> 25:08.860]  news is all the denial is over and patriots did their due diligence for
[25:08.860 --> 25:14.020]  decades reading the globalist documents exposing their architecture their
[25:14.020 --> 25:17.980]  blueprints people laughed at us they wouldn't look at the documents but they
[25:17.980 --> 25:24.260]  heard us in detail tell them the future and so now they're not saying oh great
[25:24.260 --> 25:28.660]  job you guys did the research know a lot of people are saying you're psychic how
[25:28.660 --> 25:33.420]  did you people know all this you're incredible it's like the general public
[25:33.420 --> 25:37.420]  or ignorant savages or something they think because we know how to make a fire
[25:37.420 --> 25:46.100]  or know how to you know have gunpowder that were magical no we read the club of
[25:46.100 --> 25:51.940]  Rome trilateral Commission CFR documents we read the UN documents we read books
[25:51.940 --> 25:56.100]  written by former British prime ministers and German chancellors and US
[25:56.100 --> 26:02.380]  presidents and David Rockefeller they write books bragging thousands of white
[26:02.380 --> 26:06.860]  papers out of universities and think tanks bragging how they would forcibly
[26:06.860 --> 26:10.740]  drug us how they would put cancer viruses in the vaccines to soft kill us
[26:10.740 --> 26:14.500]  how they would poison the water to sterilize us and dumb us down and all
[26:14.500 --> 26:24.300]  we've done is go gee Jiminy cricket we'd better research all of this and I
[26:24.300 --> 26:28.180]  tend to get really mad and really upset and not get depressed I don't get
[26:28.180 --> 26:32.780]  depressed I get angry when I see open-world government being announced
[26:32.780 --> 26:35.940]  and not enough people waking up fast enough but people are waking up at
[26:35.940 --> 26:41.820]  record levels and if the Congress can't get its global carbon tax bill through
[26:41.820 --> 26:47.980]  its global banking takeover through its healthcare takeover through in this
[26:47.980 --> 26:54.060]  Congress it is going to be many times harder next year probably impossible
[26:54.060 --> 26:58.860]  unless they stage a false flag terror attack and so I want to apologize to
[26:58.860 --> 27:06.140]  listeners for yelling and screaming sometimes and calling them so bees I'm
[27:06.140 --> 27:09.460]  not going to do that anymore I'm making the commitment I haven't done that in
[27:09.460 --> 27:12.900]  years and I've been getting out of control lately because the country is
[27:12.900 --> 27:20.980]  going down and I genuinely I don't get depressed I get this nasty feeling I I
[27:20.980 --> 27:25.300]  just get so angry and then I'm brooding when I'm at home and I'm brooding when
[27:25.300 --> 27:29.020]  I'm at work and so I apologize to everybody for having to be around it I
[27:29.020 --> 27:37.500]  need to be cheerful and happy and just trust in our heavenly father the maker
[27:37.500 --> 27:43.020]  to lead us and guide us through all of these perilous times it's just it's
[27:43.020 --> 27:48.140]  hard to deal with the death of the dollar it's hard to deal with that knowing
[27:48.140 --> 27:52.020]  what it's going to mean to my family in my country I mean I know who these
[27:52.020 --> 27:56.020]  people are and it's just outrageous to have to see them continue to stay in
[27:56.020 --> 28:00.180]  power to see their agenda to just to continue to expand and for all of their
[28:00.180 --> 28:05.180]  crimes to intensify but I have to understand I can't move the world by
[28:05.180 --> 28:09.100]  myself and we're not going to win in a day we're not going to win in a week
[28:09.100 --> 28:13.180]  we're not going to win in a month a year or even a decade but the battle is now
[28:13.180 --> 28:17.980]  joined the awakening is happening and the momentum is swinging against the
[28:17.980 --> 28:22.820]  enemy we've struck some serious blows against them so they're really firing
[28:22.820 --> 28:28.820]  up turning everything loose on us trying to knock us out trying to KO us
[28:28.820 --> 28:39.660]  right now there's no TKO there's no technical knockout here they've got to
[28:39.660 --> 28:44.300]  have a complete knockout and it's not going to happen and the fighting spirit
[28:44.300 --> 28:47.940]  has been awakened and the people not just in the United States but worldwide
[28:47.940 --> 28:54.340]  and all of our quote conspiracy theories have now been confirmed for
[28:54.340 --> 29:07.140]  everyone and so the system is panicking the system is in free fall that's why
[29:07.140 --> 29:12.260]  you see them trying to assert themselves boldly and in everyone's face right now
[29:12.260 --> 29:20.700]  and it's so it is great news that Republicans won in Virginia and New
[29:20.700 --> 29:26.340]  Jersey in these off-year elections great news showing the people want change
[29:26.340 --> 29:29.580]  don't expect anything out of these governors they're part of the same
[29:29.580 --> 29:36.180]  establishment but it signifies a rebuke against everything Obama's done and it
[29:36.180 --> 29:40.220]  lets members of the Democratic Congress engaging in all this treason no they're
[29:40.220 --> 29:46.980]  out of there in a year and a half but we've got to let Republicans know that

[33:23.580 --> 33:34.180]  at 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 all right let me just read to you some of the
[33:34.180 --> 33:40.700]  headlines I got stuck for 30 minutes on the fact that Republicans all across the
[33:40.700 --> 33:45.300]  country not just in these governor races but in local races swept everywhere
[33:45.300 --> 33:50.140]  just like Democrats swept the public isn't very sophisticated but they know
[33:50.140 --> 33:53.220]  they don't like the government they've got so get rid of all the Republicans
[33:53.220 --> 33:56.820]  Bush was bad oh my gosh Obama's even worse get rid of all the Democrats and
[33:56.820 --> 34:00.940]  then oh my gosh the Republicans are traders as well get rid of them but it's
[34:00.940 --> 34:05.060]  not taking three four five six years for people to go through these realignments
[34:05.060 --> 34:10.340]  now and these cycles it's taken a few months it's over for the establishment
[34:10.340 --> 34:13.540]  the media keeps going look at Republicans they're weak they've only got a
[34:13.540 --> 34:21.780]  25% approval rating for Congress yeah and the Democrats have an 11 or 12 but
[34:21.780 --> 34:25.540]  see that's a media spin well we don't think Republicans are gonna win these
[34:25.540 --> 34:30.420]  governor seats in New Jersey in Virginia because look at the Republicans
[34:30.420 --> 34:37.100]  congressional number it's 25 points man that's low yeah and it's 11 or 12
[34:37.100 --> 34:43.140]  depending on the poll for the Democrats exactly people are really starting to
[34:43.140 --> 34:48.340]  figure it out and so the media tries to create this massive fog of lies every
[34:48.340 --> 34:53.820]  national radio show every major editorial I see whether it's Republican or
[34:53.820 --> 34:57.780]  Democrats writing it every major television program on news I watch is
[34:57.780 --> 35:02.260]  Republicans better watch it they're getting too extreme they need to be main
[35:02.260 --> 35:06.580]  line middle of the road and work with Obama they're gonna lose even more seats
[35:06.580 --> 35:13.020]  if they don't know if the Republicans go along with open borders and tripling
[35:13.020 --> 35:17.700]  of government again and all these wars and all this corruption they're gonna
[35:17.700 --> 35:21.380]  lose just like the Democrats
[35:23.180 --> 35:27.860]  Republicans need to become constitutionalist if Democrats became
[35:27.860 --> 35:34.020]  constitutionalist they would win Grayson out of Florida has one of the highest
[35:34.020 --> 35:38.300]  approval ratings of any Democrat in Congress why because he is at least
[35:38.300 --> 35:42.020]  anti-establishment to the point that he calls the Federal Reserve criminal and
[35:42.020 --> 35:46.500]  calls the head and Ron lawyer for the Federal Reserve a whore people love it
[35:46.500 --> 35:52.340]  so the media demonizes him because they're scared of that mindset catching
[35:52.340 --> 35:58.220]  hold people love Ron Paul his approval ratings in most polls are above 70%
[35:58.220 --> 36:04.980]  it's even higher in Texas he won his last congressional race by a record
[36:04.980 --> 36:10.180]  landslide of right at 70% and who's running against him the mainline
[36:10.180 --> 36:15.540]  Republican neocons there's not even a Democratic challenger his challenge is
[36:15.540 --> 36:25.460]  from the Republican traders rhinos Republican in name only so you need to
[36:25.460 --> 36:31.140]  let the Democrats know you are going to vote against them Republicans like
[36:31.140 --> 36:34.980]  Lindsey Graham that traitor in the Senate pushing through the climate bill
[36:34.980 --> 36:39.540]  the the total takeover of our society that guy needs to have a recall done on
[36:39.540 --> 36:43.060]  him right now I'll guarantee you if senator Lindsey Graham's constituents
[36:43.060 --> 36:46.100]  if a thousand of you because every phone call signifies a thousand
[36:46.100 --> 36:53.860]  constituents every letter signifies 10,000 if you would call him and say
[36:53.860 --> 36:57.140]  we're launching a recall of Lindsey Graham and don't let him play that game
[36:57.140 --> 37:02.340]  of oh well if you get rid of me you'll get something worse we don't care the
[37:02.340 --> 37:06.780]  point is we're gonna punish you and then we'll recall the next guy we've got to
[37:06.780 --> 37:11.980]  get aggressive with these people they wouldn't have been able to pass this
[37:11.980 --> 37:16.060]  thing into committee and mark it up to go to the full Senate if it wasn't for
[37:16.060 --> 37:20.140]  Lindsey Graham and these disgusting globalist thank him and praise him all
[37:20.140 --> 37:23.940]  over the news van kind moon in that weekend a half ago editorial the New
[37:23.940 --> 37:29.660]  York Times called we can do it just as stupid as yes we can Bob the builder la
[37:29.660 --> 37:35.220]  la la in fact go to YouTube guys Craig will you go pull up Bob the builder I
[37:35.220 --> 37:38.980]  want to play that later and show people how a children's cartoon is where they
[37:38.980 --> 37:50.620]  got this yes we can mindless chant from and ban chi moon we can do it yay we can
[37:50.620 --> 37:59.460]  do it we can bring you to justice okay see I said I was in each other news and
[37:59.460 --> 38:02.940]  I went off into another rant about that it's these people are unpopular
[38:02.940 --> 38:09.820]  they're criminal what they're doing is illegal the military and police are
[38:09.820 --> 38:14.340]  waking up I cannot tell you how many military and police send us information
[38:14.340 --> 38:17.660]  how many police and military stopped me on the street and say that they support
[38:17.660 --> 38:20.860]  what we're doing I can't tell you how many other talk show host I talked to
[38:20.860 --> 38:24.980]  where they have police coming up to their radio stations thanking them for
[38:24.980 --> 38:29.060]  speaking out against the New World Order oh the police have bad commanders in
[38:29.060 --> 38:32.900]  almost every case because they're federalized they just didn't get the memo
[38:32.900 --> 38:40.140]  yet but the average cop is waking up now sure we get videos every day of cops
[38:40.140 --> 38:46.740]  tasering old people for no reason of bad police who are trigger happy beating
[38:46.740 --> 38:50.540]  up all women shooting people on the back and then the commanders support them and
[38:50.540 --> 38:54.500]  they don't get in trouble thus demonizing police more which is what the
[38:54.500 --> 38:58.060]  system wants so it's an us against them mentality and I only figured out this
[38:58.060 --> 39:02.100]  trick in the last few years I used to fall for it and I still speak out against
[39:02.100 --> 39:05.380]  bad cops and corruption but I'm beginning to understand the more
[39:05.380 --> 39:08.900]  sophisticated nuances of these people's tricks and the more I learn the more I
[39:08.900 --> 39:14.140]  understand it's just all opening up to me you know everybody the more wisdom you
[39:14.140 --> 39:19.060]  get the more you learn you don't understand and the more you realize how
[39:19.060 --> 39:27.260]  completely blind the public is but if they would just punish bad cops then the
[39:27.260 --> 39:30.980]  police wouldn't be thugs but they promote the thugs and by the way coming
[39:30.980 --> 39:37.980]  up the news minor newspaper reports 81 year old tasered by Ellison Air Force
[39:37.980 --> 39:44.300]  based police outside the base posse commentatus is truly dead and every
[39:44.300 --> 39:49.140]  few days I see reports of military arresting us citizens off base and
[39:49.140 --> 39:53.460]  there's this incredible taser video out of Minneapolis where the guy gets out of
[39:53.460 --> 39:57.140]  the car puts his hands on the squad car and the cop walks up like he's not going
[39:57.140 --> 40:00.980]  to do anything and then gets behind him premeditatedly and tasers him in the
[40:00.980 --> 40:04.780]  neck and then gets him on the ground at point blank range tasering him with
[40:04.780 --> 40:10.660]  pleasure and it's just like deer hunters there's a lot of people I've been
[40:10.660 --> 40:14.540]  deer hunting with over the years at different hunts I've been on back when
[40:14.540 --> 40:19.260]  I had time and there's always this guy that's got 20 fancy rifles in the back
[40:19.260 --> 40:24.460]  of their truck and they're got every gadget and everything in the world but
[40:24.460 --> 40:28.380]  they can't hit the side of a barn if they tried and every time a big buck or
[40:28.380 --> 40:33.540]  big elk or big muley comes out or they see it in the woods they can't wait
[40:33.540 --> 40:38.260]  till it comes out to the edge of the clearing they just start blasting buck
[40:38.260 --> 40:43.060]  fever and I've seen the videos of these cops they just want to shoot somebody
[40:43.060 --> 40:47.020]  they want to taser somebody they're dangerous they need to be off the force
[40:47.020 --> 40:54.300]  now they're nuts they're nuts and they shouldn't be deer hunting these are the
[40:54.300 --> 40:58.620]  types of people that go out to national parks and shoot little kids and people and
[40:58.620 --> 41:04.700]  shoot cows every county in Texas I read reports every year where people are
[41:04.700 --> 41:08.580]  hunting on somebody's land and shoot somebody's Brahma bull over the next
[41:08.580 --> 41:15.300]  fence they can't tell a giant gray bull from a buck because they want to shoot
[41:15.300 --> 41:21.300]  something alright alright I'm ranting I just watch these cops and these guys
[41:21.300 --> 41:27.180]  have no business in uniform no business with great power comes great
[41:27.180 --> 41:31.980]  responsibility you know they've covered up the video cams of the black guy they
[41:31.980 --> 41:36.300]  shot to death in Austin and we all know they have that videotapes that's a lie
[41:36.300 --> 41:40.500]  that they don't have them but that the both squad cars weren't rolling but the
[41:40.500 --> 41:44.060]  audio has been released so these guys screaming and yelling as they're as one
[41:44.060 --> 41:53.180]  guy's dying and every few months an Austin cops shoot somebody in the back
[41:53.180 --> 41:59.380]  and how many times have citizens videotape police shooting somebody in
[41:59.380 --> 42:03.020]  handcuffs on the ground and then the police lie and plant a gun on them and
[42:03.020 --> 42:07.900]  say oh they tried to shoot me they shot this libertarian 9-11 truther and now
[42:07.900 --> 42:11.180]  there's multiple witnesses that came forward and said no he got out of the car
[42:11.180 --> 42:15.980]  they tasered him he pulled the tasers out got on his knees and the cop shot him
[42:15.980 --> 42:19.820]  twice and of course the cops lied and said he pulled a gun and all this you
[42:19.820 --> 42:26.580]  know you guys are really discrediting yourselves your trigger happy morons who
[42:26.580 --> 42:32.380]  play call of duty and doom when you're home at night in your apartment and you
[42:32.380 --> 42:36.300]  think a zombie popped up in front of you when it was just some pathetic citizen
[42:36.300 --> 42:42.940]  you just double capped you need to be brought to justice for all the stuff
[42:42.940 --> 42:48.540]  you're doing to us you understand I'm tired of it and the people are tired of
[42:48.540 --> 42:54.420]  it are now gone into a police ramp 1-800-259-9231 this is the type of news
[42:54.420 --> 42:58.620]  I have in my stack Al Gore's inconvenient truth sequel stresses spiritual
[42:58.620 --> 43:03.540]  argument on climate they aren't shifting to a spiritual argument because the
[43:03.540 --> 43:07.460]  science is disproving them by the way Al Gore's now come out and admitted that
[43:07.460 --> 43:11.540]  most the co2 isn't man-made and that maybe that's not what's happening but he
[43:11.540 --> 43:18.540]  says spiritually we have to cut greenhouse gases well morey strong and
[43:18.540 --> 43:22.900]  all these people are complete occultists they want a one-world Gaia
[43:22.900 --> 43:27.340]  religion that's what we cover and fall the republic of course it's a new
[43:27.340 --> 43:32.460]  religion these people aren't anti-religion they're just against
[43:32.460 --> 43:36.860]  established religions they want their old-time religion to be in control they
[43:36.860 --> 43:41.220]  are deep occultist and they also understand as scientific technicians of
[43:41.220 --> 43:49.260]  society that people love religion and this is an anti-human anti-industrial
[43:49.260 --> 43:55.620]  religion so that's now admitted you and undersecretary general calls for
[43:55.620 --> 43:58.940]  increase in pledge funding for climate change for more than a hundred billion
[43:58.940 --> 44:03.020]  from each of the industrialized nations another big prison planet article Al
[44:03.020 --> 44:07.060]  Gore admits co2 does not cause majority of global warming well yeah the UN's
[44:07.060 --> 44:10.300]  own reports is three to six percent depending on which report you look at
[44:10.300 --> 44:17.140]  of co2 is man-made and of that three to six percent it's precious the plants
[44:17.140 --> 44:21.780]  just gobble it up all the ice core samples show conclusively that we're in
[44:21.780 --> 44:25.820]  a carbon dioxide and oxygen-starved environment the planet goes through these
[44:25.820 --> 44:31.380]  cycles we have low oxygen and low carbon dioxide and oxygen and carbon dioxide
[44:31.380 --> 44:37.180]  are not poisonous they are good it is not a conspiracy theory that plants
[44:37.180 --> 44:43.380]  breathe they absorb carbon dioxide it is their life-giving gas it's what they
[44:43.380 --> 44:52.340]  use in their bodies we use oxygen bound to red blood cells they use carbon to
[44:52.340 --> 45:00.420]  oxide bound to their cells it's their blood it is not a conspiracy theory like
[45:00.420 --> 45:03.740]  Al Gore they actually say that's a conspiracy theory they have a Wikipedia
[45:03.740 --> 45:11.900]  page called the the dihydrogen monoxide conspiracy theory and they say oh
[45:11.900 --> 45:17.460]  there's a conspiracy theory that people make the point that carbon dioxide isn't
[45:17.460 --> 45:20.980]  deadly but just like most people will call for banning the hydrogen monoxide
[45:20.980 --> 45:25.420]  and then the conspiracy theorist make the point that that shows the public's
[45:25.420 --> 45:33.940]  ignorance of these gases and of water what is the conspiracy theory that's
[45:33.940 --> 45:38.980]  like telling Galileo who says that the earth is not the center of the universe
[45:38.980 --> 45:43.300]  is a conspiracy theorist I mean it's just nonsensical you go hey Al Gore
[45:43.300 --> 45:47.820]  you're making money off of the climate bills that's a conspiracy theory do you
[45:47.820 --> 45:51.500]  believe in moon landings that's his canned answer he said it again on TV
[45:51.500 --> 45:56.420]  yesterday you're like no you're part of these companies making money off it oh
[45:56.420 --> 46:00.140]  you believe it in land on the moon your conspiracy theorist hey people say ban
[46:00.140 --> 46:03.820]  water because they don't understand the scientific term and it sounds scary to
[46:03.820 --> 46:08.980]  hydrogen monoxide oh your conspiracy theorist Wikipedia says it's a
[46:08.980 --> 46:12.620]  conspiracy theory that there's a global government forming calling itself the
[46:12.620 --> 46:16.700]  New World Order I guess they didn't know that in one week a month and a half ago
[46:16.700 --> 46:19.780]  there were 12,000 plus mainstream news articles calling for world
[46:19.780 --> 46:27.340]  government see this is the game they think you're so stupid they think you're
[46:27.340 --> 46:33.420]  so dumb that they can just sit there and tell you that carbon dioxide is a
[46:33.420 --> 46:40.860]  deadly poison they've now listed it as a toxin as a pollutant they think you're
[46:40.860 --> 46:44.140]  so stupid they tell you there's not a world government as it's openly been
[46:44.140 --> 46:48.580]  unveiled in the last year they think you're so stupid that you can't read
[46:48.580 --> 46:52.500]  the vaccine insert that says mercury's in there and it can cause neurological
[46:52.500 --> 46:57.580]  disorders and sterilization and infertility and autoimmune disorders
[46:57.580 --> 47:03.700]  they think you're dumb are you if you were smart we take this country back and
[47:03.700 --> 47:07.900]  arrest these people and this could all be over very quickly but we've been taught
[47:07.900 --> 47:11.900]  it's cutesy and fun to not stand up to government corruption because they've
[47:11.900 --> 47:15.540]  taught us that that doesn't exist anytime you criticize the government it's a
[47:15.540 --> 47:23.660]  conspiracy theory I went to the smart growth conference in 2000 no in 1999 in
[47:23.660 --> 47:28.020]  Austin and they openly admitted they were gonna steal all the property in
[47:28.020 --> 47:31.020]  Austin it was all a big business and we're laughing about it on stage then I
[47:31.020 --> 47:33.740]  came back and show people the video and they emailed me and called me saying it
[47:33.740 --> 47:40.020]  was a conspiracy theory I'm told it's a conspiracy theory that they're building
[47:40.020 --> 47:43.740]  four sewage treatment plants on Lake Travis doesn't matter it's admitted the
[47:43.740 --> 47:47.580]  public's trained to live in denial and they say not true I'm not gonna do
[47:47.580 --> 47:54.020]  anything about it I want to swim in sewage people are trained to shuffle off
[47:54.020 --> 48:03.620]  and throw off any type of responsibility okay in this segment the next and I'm
[48:03.620 --> 48:08.860]  going to calls and news for the entire next hour 1-800-259-9231 I wanted to
[48:08.860 --> 48:17.860]  bring Ted Anderson up today briefly because gold has gone over $1093 an ounce
[48:17.860 --> 48:24.860]  today and Ted is running out of the gold that he bought at the 920 level in
[48:24.860 --> 48:30.100]  fact he was telling me this morning as one coin group left at the 920 level the
[48:30.100 --> 48:33.300]  other is a little bit more that again then when he bought into the market
[48:33.300 --> 48:36.820]  that's what the market was and so you would be paying a lot more now if you
[48:36.820 --> 48:40.700]  bought these from him and he's about to run out Ted Anderson gold shortages
[48:40.700 --> 48:45.060]  everywhere being announced record demand for gold associated presses

[49:00.700 --> 49:06.220]  we've seen a high today of 1,096 and if you think about that for just a
[49:06.220 --> 49:10.060]  minute all we have to do is see a four dollar increase in gold and we've hit
[49:10.060 --> 49:15.820]  $1,100 an ounce that's gonna happen I have a I'm a hundred percent convinced
[49:15.820 --> 49:21.140]  of it and I'm not saying that it'll happen today we could happen tomorrow but
[49:21.140 --> 49:24.460]  it's gonna happen we're just you know we're gonna blow through that that we
[49:24.460 --> 49:28.180]  know what this is happening the third largest bank city bank declares bankruptcy

[52:37.740 --> 52:41.540]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who

[53:06.380 --> 53:10.420]  them to get worse the warning signs have been everywhere for a very long time
[53:10.420 --> 53:14.940]  therefore you have no excuse not to be prepared if another great depression
[53:14.940 --> 53:19.500]  strikes America how will you excuse your lack of preparation to your loved ones

[53:56.660 --> 53:59.140]  insurance
[53:59.140 --> 54:10.020]  it's all happening according to the globalist plan the destruction of every
[54:10.020 --> 54:15.020]  sovereign nation-state on earth they've sucked up the resources manpower the
[54:15.020 --> 54:19.060]  ingenuity the smarts of the American people to build their world government
[54:19.060 --> 54:25.220]  now they're tanking the Republic into the dustbin of history but they bargained
[54:25.220 --> 54:30.180]  for the people to rise against him but not at anywhere near this level the
[54:30.180 --> 54:34.860]  people are rising to the challenge to save the Republic the Bill of Rights the
[54:34.860 --> 54:40.900]  Constitution to identify the enemies of this country that have destroyed the
[54:40.900 --> 54:49.220]  dollar I salute all of you in your long tireless fight as you have battled
[54:49.220 --> 54:54.620]  tooth and nail against the globalist because of you we've got a fighting
[54:54.620 --> 55:01.740]  chance going back to Ted Anderson Ted tell folks about today's gold offer that
[55:01.740 --> 55:05.580]  well isn't gonna last long in fact one of the gold offers you had yesterday is
[55:05.580 --> 55:09.220]  now sold out what do you have left from the market when you bought in at the
[55:09.220 --> 55:15.380]  920 level yeah well gold gold set from 920 obviously has gone up a tremendous
[55:15.380 --> 55:19.420]  amount I mean just time I was the last time I was on the air with you or last
[55:19.420 --> 55:24.140]  week gold's gone up $40 an ounce I have the Frank's they went up just a little
[55:24.140 --> 55:33.100]  bit they went from the 236 dollars to 238 still that's just a steal the
[55:33.100 --> 55:37.860]  British sovereign currently right now is at 293 that coins up three bucks
[55:37.860 --> 55:41.980]  presently right now the walking Liberty halves are still at the older price low
[55:41.980 --> 55:48.540]  price of 869 a piece the Lakota coin $22.30 doesn't even reflect the fact
[55:48.540 --> 55:54.740]  that Silver's gone up the coin the $10 Liberty right now is at 818 50 that
[55:54.740 --> 56:00.500]  coin is priced based upon gold being back down at that $920 an ounce level
[56:00.500 --> 56:05.700]  just right now I can tell you I've got a wide variety of different items here and
[56:05.700 --> 56:10.980]  the the market is so hot and the quantities of what's being sold not
[56:10.980 --> 56:14.700]  only by Midas but all the rest of the gold and silver dealers in the United
[56:14.700 --> 56:19.420]  States there just isn't enough physical supply to meet the demand right now and
[56:19.420 --> 56:23.300]  premiums are going to start rising again and for people that want to get
[56:23.300 --> 56:27.340]  involved in gold and silver I would suggest that you do it now rather than
[56:27.340 --> 56:31.820]  wait till more crises comes along and these prices go up even further I mean
[56:31.820 --> 56:37.020]  we're just sitting right on the verge of going to $1100 an ounce and really the
[56:37.020 --> 56:41.980]  next level to see after that is that $1300 level that Bloomberg's talking
[56:41.980 --> 56:46.980]  about and then who knows 2600 from there I you know I just can't tell you
[56:46.980 --> 56:51.860]  enough our fee on paper system is in trouble we have a lot of people in
[56:51.860 --> 56:56.020]  other nations trying to get away from the US dollar because they know it's in
[56:56.020 --> 57:00.020]  trouble they can see the handwriting on the wall and for some reason there's
[57:00.020 --> 57:03.980]  still some yuppies here in the United States that thinks that we're going to
[57:03.980 --> 57:07.620]  have this recovery miraculously and everything's going to be great again
[57:07.620 --> 57:12.100]  it's just not going to happen oh well they're telling us the economy is great
[57:12.100 --> 57:16.660]  because private banks are making record profits and consolidating their
[57:16.660 --> 57:24.180]  industry but manufacturing joblessness inflation starting to tick up it's all
[57:24.180 --> 57:27.460]  there we wish this wasn't the case we wish the dollar wasn't at a record low
[57:27.460 --> 57:31.940]  today folks give minus resources a call Ted how long can you hold these prices
[57:31.940 --> 57:36.420]  well I'm gonna be holding these prices tell midnight tonight and I just it's
[57:36.420 --> 57:41.900]  too hard to tell I mean I could be looking at $1,130 gold tomorrow I mean
[57:41.900 --> 57:45.260]  that's what happens when you jump through the next resistance level you
[57:45.260 --> 57:50.820]  realize that right now $1,060 an ounce looks cheap right now for gold I mean I
[57:50.820 --> 57:56.860]  was talking about $1,060 becoming a peak here just about a week ago and now we're
[57:56.860 --> 58:00.300]  looking at that and that would be would be happy to be able to pay that again for
[58:00.300 --> 58:06.340]  it you know hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six two
[58:06.340 --> 58:09.780]  two three seven the brokers are there right now tell them it's the Ted
[58:09.780 --> 58:14.700]  Anderson I was shown special if you want to get the lower prices even the higher
[58:14.700 --> 58:18.780]  prices are a great deal but this is just an amazing deal eight hundred six eight
[58:18.780 --> 58:26.300]  six two two three seven I buy gold and silver as an emergency hedge because the
[58:26.300 --> 58:29.820]  other investments aren't trustworthy and are deteriorating I've had a lot of
[58:29.820 --> 58:34.740]  people are buying it for investment it's certainly pushing a four times increase
[58:34.740 --> 58:42.780]  from what it was eight hundred six eight six two two three seven thank you for

[58:51.860 --> 58:55.860]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new

[59:08.380 --> 59:12.860]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[59:12.860 --> 59:17.580]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.580 --> 59:21.380]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.380 --> 59:24.980]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:24.980 --> 59:29.340]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.340 --> 59:32.500]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[1:02:07.980 --> 1:02:13.300]  independently tested and they freaked out just absolutely freaked out oh you
[1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:16.420]  can't do that you can't do that you know because they know they know what
[1:02:16.420 --> 1:02:21.060]  they're doing what airport is this no this is not the airport they try to
[1:02:21.060 --> 1:02:25.380]  blame it on the airport this is a just fine I'm out in the middle of Indiana and
[1:02:25.380 --> 1:02:28.740]  then you know not even get a mile down the road I went to go talk to an old
[1:02:28.740 --> 1:02:33.780]  um the father of one of my friends growing up sir who were you who are you
[1:02:33.780 --> 1:02:38.140]  saying was spraying you oh who knows I know I know I know this farm is in
[1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:41.620]  charge of um they they bought up a whole bunch of land around here you know a
[1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:46.700]  lot of a lot of cropland a lot of corn and so they're cropped and so they're
[1:02:46.700 --> 1:02:50.020]  cropped dusting uh-huh and then and then it is I get pulled over and I
[1:02:50.020 --> 1:02:54.500]  mentioned this all the cop you know they they and they instantly get mad and I
[1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:58.020]  you know acting like I'm I don't know what I'm talking about I go they were
[1:02:58.020 --> 1:03:01.060]  doing one as we were talking of actually they weren't doing one they were
[1:03:01.060 --> 1:03:04.740]  doing four I said well what's that right there they said oh that's water but he
[1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:08.580]  never took he never took his eyes off me he never he never looked around and
[1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:12.100]  he said oh well maybe that is something he just he just kept his eyes on me the
[1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:14.900]  whole time oh yeah the same cop would tell you there's no mercury in the
[1:03:14.900 --> 1:03:20.500]  vaccines thanks Ryan Kerry in Mississippi you're on the air hey Alex I
[1:03:20.500 --> 1:03:25.940]  just wanted to talk a little about the CIT group uh bankruptcy um CIT group is
[1:03:25.940 --> 1:03:30.260]  not the same group institution or city group or city bank
[1:03:30.260 --> 1:03:34.740]  CIT group actually um is more significant with the bankruptcies in
[1:03:34.740 --> 1:03:38.340]  reference to what you and Bob Chapman have been talking about for the past
[1:03:38.340 --> 1:03:40.900]  year and a half which is the next shoe to fall
[1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:44.740]  commercial real estate but see I thought that on Monday when I saw it because it
[1:03:44.740 --> 1:03:49.460]  said CIT group but then I saw other reports that it's part of city group is
[1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:54.500]  that wrong because I get things wrong no yeah I know what the reports you saw
[1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:58.820]  because they've actually one of the big reports that came out they wrote CIT in
[1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:02.820]  small letters instead of big letters and then they wrote group after it so that
[1:04:02.820 --> 1:04:06.660]  people thought that it was city group but no it's actually CIT group
[1:04:06.660 --> 1:04:10.660]  it's not insignificant to go to that that they went bankrupt they've been
[1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:15.060]  walking zombies for like a year and the big thing with them is
[1:04:15.060 --> 1:04:18.260]  they were so heavily invested in commercial real estate I don't think
[1:04:18.260 --> 1:04:21.460]  they they'd allow like city bank to to get taken
[1:04:21.460 --> 1:04:24.580]  down um CIT group is not a member of the shutter
[1:04:24.580 --> 1:04:28.020]  no you're right you're right and I remember what was that associated
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:33.540]  press headline and it said city group fails and then I'm looking at it it
[1:04:33.540 --> 1:04:38.020]  says city group bankrupt in one headline then another says city group
[1:04:38.020 --> 1:04:41.140]  versus city group CIT group versus city group
[1:04:41.140 --> 1:04:44.500]  there you go so that's a mistake well that's good news but then I saw the
[1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:47.860]  other reports saying what happens if city group fails
[1:04:47.860 --> 1:04:52.340]  and so uh boy that is a big correction I need to make uh tell me more about CIT
[1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:56.020]  group on the other side see I told you folks we do make mistakes from time to
[1:04:56.020 --> 1:04:59.460]  time and we will fix it but why is the media then
[1:04:59.460 --> 1:05:03.220]  writing the headlines have you heard that millionaire entrepreneur businessman

[1:08:05.540 --> 1:08:09.380]  on the gcn radio network
[1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:19.220]  yeah i've googled the term and i'm not the only one that got confused by
[1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:25.140]  headlines saying cit group files for bankruptcy then
[1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:28.420]  sites all over the country in the world said city group
[1:08:28.420 --> 1:08:32.180]  filing for bankruptcy then there's other articles now today saying cit
[1:08:32.180 --> 1:08:36.180]  group versus city group cit files for bankruptcy what about city
[1:08:36.180 --> 1:08:40.500]  group so that that created all this confusion and i
[1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:44.660]  got that wrong that i'm not the only one because
[1:08:44.660 --> 1:08:48.900]  at the same time in the news they're talking about city group
[1:08:48.900 --> 1:08:53.540]  going down next or bank of america that's been discussed for the last year so
[1:08:53.540 --> 1:08:56.740]  that's how that's how that happened and that's why i love taking your phone
[1:08:56.740 --> 1:09:00.900]  calls because we make a mistake or so every week of that
[1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:04.180]  magnitude so thank you so much kary in mississippi
[1:09:04.180 --> 1:09:08.740]  but yeah cit group it's giant as well i'll tell us about that kary
[1:09:08.740 --> 1:09:11.940]  yeah well you know a lot of people are confused about that and like you said
[1:09:11.940 --> 1:09:15.220]  there was some really obvious mistakes that were made by the media reporting
[1:09:15.220 --> 1:09:19.460]  agencies that lifted my eyebrow but not to be confused with
[1:09:19.460 --> 1:09:24.340]  city group was invested heavily in cit group yeah well that's what i saw on
[1:09:24.340 --> 1:09:28.340]  headlines monday too it was cit group bankrupt
[1:09:28.340 --> 1:09:31.620]  what does this mean for city group in fact that was the exact headline and
[1:09:31.620 --> 1:09:35.380]  that's i think everybody got confused because it was all over the news saying
[1:09:35.380 --> 1:09:39.780]  cit connected to city group bankruptcy and so
[1:09:39.780 --> 1:09:44.580]  that's why this was being reported everywhere not just here you know
[1:09:44.580 --> 1:09:48.500]  yeah exactly uh... cit group was very heavily invested in commercial real
[1:09:48.500 --> 1:09:51.460]  estate and they really started getting hit
[1:09:51.460 --> 1:09:54.980]  with the default on commercial which is just starting it
[1:09:54.980 --> 1:09:57.700]  like i said you and bob chapman have been warning about
[1:09:57.700 --> 1:10:01.380]  for a year the commodity residential real estate is just a
[1:10:01.380 --> 1:10:04.820]  it's a drop in the bucket compared to the size of commercial
[1:10:04.820 --> 1:10:09.460]  and then the major banks like cit group the bank bank of america
[1:10:09.460 --> 1:10:13.380]  bear stern before they went down they were heavily invested in commercial and
[1:10:13.380 --> 1:10:17.380]  residential but the difference in the way that they handled those assets was
[1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:20.660]  that the residential they did stop in security
[1:10:20.660 --> 1:10:23.460]  a lot of the commercial they kept they kept the
[1:10:23.460 --> 1:10:27.380]  hold of those loans they're now starting to diss them because like with
[1:10:27.380 --> 1:10:32.900]  city group and cit group when cit group saw how much trouble cit group was in
[1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:36.740]  they pulled out which is one of the reasons cit group is now in bankruptcy
[1:10:36.740 --> 1:10:40.500]  because so many of them the banks the actual commercial banks
[1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:44.500]  they were invested in them or helping them or or extending a line of credit to
[1:10:44.500 --> 1:10:49.060]  them started to pull back this they've been walking dead like i said for
[1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:52.980]  probably six eight months at least just cit group
[1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:57.060]  so you know city city group itself the bank
[1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:00.660]  they are a member of the federal reserve system there is you know
[1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:04.260]  you know back in the days when they were national city bank of new york city
[1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:07.220]  they were one of the founding members one of the primary
[1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:10.660]  classy stockholders of the federal reserve bank of new york
[1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:14.580]  so yes i'm reading over it i'm reading over it right now
[1:11:14.580 --> 1:11:18.260]  and that's clearly what the media is saying is that the two are interconnected
[1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:22.020]  heavily and so that's what caused all the confusion not just the name similarity
[1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:25.940]  but the fact that the two are inter intertwined and yes i know city group
[1:11:25.940 --> 1:11:30.580]  itself is a federal reserve uh shareholder thank you so much kerry
[1:11:30.580 --> 1:11:34.820]  for setting this straight on that uh james in ohio james you're on the air
[1:11:34.820 --> 1:11:40.580]  go ahead hey alex uh nice to talk to you uh i just want to tell you a great
[1:11:40.580 --> 1:11:44.660]  job on paul the republic uh anybody listening if you ain't seen
[1:11:44.660 --> 1:11:48.260]  you really need to watch it in a copy somehow
[1:11:48.260 --> 1:11:51.300]  i've been well and it's not just for people that already know what's going
[1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:54.340]  on it's made for people that don't know
[1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:57.460]  and it's done in a very easy to understand but also
[1:11:57.460 --> 1:12:01.860]  uh very very not entertaining but but very very riveting
[1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:05.620]  and and and well done uh way with it so
[1:12:05.620 --> 1:12:09.540]  i think in my opinion it puts a little more names to the faces
[1:12:09.540 --> 1:12:13.860]  too and makes people you know understand that
[1:12:13.860 --> 1:12:18.580]  there are people and these people in particular have it out for you
[1:12:18.580 --> 1:12:23.540]  uh i owe well it shows obama and other world leaders calling for world
[1:12:23.540 --> 1:12:27.060]  government it shows them saying one thing
[1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:31.060]  previously and then saying another it really shows the lies of these people
[1:12:31.060 --> 1:12:34.020]  and it also is all about showing how republicans and
[1:12:34.020 --> 1:12:37.940]  democrats at the highest levels work for the same group
[1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:42.500]  well if you watch it also the uh you watch the movie and then yesterday the
[1:12:42.500 --> 1:12:45.700]  chancellor of germany played right into it perfectly too
[1:12:45.700 --> 1:12:49.940]  that was that was beautiful yeah she said we've got to have this global tax
[1:12:49.940 --> 1:12:54.820]  to save our earth meanwhile al gore has come out and admitted
[1:12:54.820 --> 1:12:58.340]  it's an amazing admission this prison planet article should go out
[1:12:58.340 --> 1:13:02.740]  everywhere al gore admits co2 does not cause majority of global warming
[1:13:02.740 --> 1:13:06.820]  because people are now looking at the actual science even the un's own report
[1:13:06.820 --> 1:13:10.580]  says a tiny amount of co2 is human generated
[1:13:10.580 --> 1:13:13.700]  i mean the oceans are the biggest driver they release
[1:13:13.700 --> 1:13:18.500]  just unbelievable amounts of co2 into the atmosphere it's it's it's just
[1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:23.780]  unbelievably huge wanted to ask you if you was able to uh
[1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:29.380]  get in contact with uh jimbo trafficking we've tried really hard and no we
[1:13:29.380 --> 1:13:32.740]  probably called traffic in 20 times talked to his life a whole bunch
[1:13:32.740 --> 1:13:36.180]  and she keeps saying she'll pass on the message so if anybody knows traffic
[1:13:36.180 --> 1:13:40.820]  and tell him to uh come on the show appreciate the call
[1:13:40.820 --> 1:13:44.500]  let's talk to scott in arizona scott you're on the air
[1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:48.980]  hey alex i ditto on the uh kudos on the movie
[1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:53.140]  uh question for you i tried to get through yesterday and i couldn't quite
[1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:56.660]  gather from the comments you were making uh originally when you're talking about
[1:13:56.660 --> 1:14:01.140]  camp fema which i also picked up from you the uh the word was
[1:14:01.140 --> 1:14:05.300]  that gary franching and groups said no we're not going to
[1:14:05.300 --> 1:14:08.020]  uh release this you need to go ahead and buy a couple comments you made
[1:14:08.020 --> 1:14:11.700]  yesterday gave me the impression that maybe that could possibly be compressed
[1:14:11.700 --> 1:14:14.900]  and bundled and given out with uh fall the republic
[1:14:14.900 --> 1:14:19.300]  i wanted a little clarification on that well here's the deal here's the deal
[1:14:19.300 --> 1:14:24.580]  i can only speak for alex jones i make my documentary films
[1:14:24.580 --> 1:14:28.980]  and i encourage people to make copies of them for not for sale purposes because
[1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:32.740]  if i let people sell them number one i won't be making another film because
[1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:38.420]  i'll be bankrupt number two uh i can lose control of my films they
[1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:41.780]  can then say that they're their films you have people even try that
[1:14:41.780 --> 1:14:45.780]  now separately i can't sit here and speak
[1:14:45.780 --> 1:14:50.340]  for other filmmakers but i think you should buy the original dvd
[1:14:50.340 --> 1:14:54.500]  of camp fema and have viewing parties and and show it to people and they said
[1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:58.420]  you can show it in theaters uh to folks but i can't sit here
[1:14:58.420 --> 1:15:02.180]  and speak for people camp fema is not my documentary
[1:15:02.180 --> 1:15:05.220]  i didn't make camp fema i consulted on it some
[1:15:05.220 --> 1:15:08.900]  i'm the main presenter there's a lot of other great presenters in it
[1:15:08.900 --> 1:15:13.140]  and it's just a very good film you can give people to explain the fema camps
[1:15:13.140 --> 1:15:17.380]  uh but but but yes follow the republic uh
[1:15:17.380 --> 1:15:22.580]  and my other documentaries on the back it says copy and share of this disc
[1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:26.740]  uh so again i'm not yerry franchi or william lewis i cannot speak for them
[1:15:26.740 --> 1:15:29.940]  sir yeah i just wanted to okay i i just but i'm not
[1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:32.580]  down things i heard it yeah absolutely and just want to let you
[1:15:32.580 --> 1:15:34.740]  know just to brighten your day a little bit
[1:15:34.740 --> 1:15:39.060]  uh we got uh 500 copies made and those are going out and we're fixing to do
[1:15:39.060 --> 1:15:44.660]  another 500 so we're we're math uh math viral
[1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:49.140]  virally uh getting this stuff you are you are
[1:15:49.140 --> 1:15:52.740]  awesome scott what response are you getting from the people you've given it
[1:15:52.740 --> 1:15:57.060]  to um you from the people all that i'm just i don't
[1:15:57.060 --> 1:16:00.100]  know half the people that are most of the people that it's going to
[1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:03.460]  the response typically how i approach people on this though is i just have
[1:16:03.460 --> 1:16:06.740]  to say hey you know do you love this country do you
[1:16:06.740 --> 1:16:09.860]  like this country yes i do i mean the obvious answer to that one
[1:16:09.860 --> 1:16:12.740]  and do you sense that there's something wrong going on
[1:16:12.740 --> 1:16:15.140]  yeah there's definitely something wrong going on you know they're i mean
[1:16:15.140 --> 1:16:17.700]  everybody just like you talked about everybody
[1:16:17.700 --> 1:16:20.660]  understands there's something not right going on and i say
[1:16:20.660 --> 1:16:25.220]  then you've got to watch this it's legally copied and you can make copies
[1:16:25.220 --> 1:16:29.220]  this will explain what's going on it will blow your mind because most of the
[1:16:29.220 --> 1:16:31.540]  people don't have a clue and of course you know i try to
[1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:34.420]  you bait it a little bit to get them excited about to say oh my god what's
[1:16:34.420 --> 1:16:38.980]  really on this thing and uh so you know people are very receptive
[1:16:38.980 --> 1:16:41.860]  to it and uh they you know they want to take it they
[1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:44.580]  want to watch it i was handing them out on halloween
[1:16:44.580 --> 1:16:47.540]  you know took the kids trick-or-treat in each house you know and go to the house
[1:16:47.540 --> 1:16:51.460]  and say hey i've got a treat for you as the adult and i ran into some people
[1:16:51.460 --> 1:16:54.500]  who said oh yeah you know we yeah we definitely are into this stuff and you
[1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:56.660]  know they didn't necessarily know of you but they've
[1:16:56.660 --> 1:16:59.860]  they've heard of the the michael moore stuff or glenn back you know and if
[1:16:59.860 --> 1:17:02.900]  somebody says oh i like glenn back you know i say well you got to take this
[1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:06.500]  and get the real truth and yeah i see michael moore is the
[1:17:06.500 --> 1:17:11.460]  anti-establishment person to soak up all the revolution on the left
[1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:14.660]  and glenn beck is the supposed right winger
[1:17:14.660 --> 1:17:19.220]  anti-establishment counterfeit and he's supposed to control
[1:17:19.220 --> 1:17:23.380]  the revolution from the right and to keep it in a left right
[1:17:23.380 --> 1:17:27.060]  uh paradigm and i'm not here to bash moore or bash beck
[1:17:27.060 --> 1:17:31.540]  the point is they don't take you all the way with the information
[1:17:31.540 --> 1:17:37.620]  uh and we do and we do it also that's not in a religious or racist manner
[1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:40.740]  of all this infighting because the establishment wants us to make this
[1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:44.900]  racial or religious that's a further divide and conquer system we just state
[1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:47.860]  what the big banks what the criminal leader doing
[1:17:47.860 --> 1:17:51.620]  and the fact that it's illegal and that needs to be stopped and the way you put
[1:17:51.620 --> 1:17:55.460]  that the way that that that you're breaking the ice with people
[1:17:55.460 --> 1:17:59.060]  is extremely effective great job good to hear from you scott keep it up
[1:17:59.060 --> 1:18:02.500]  let's talk to justin and ohio justin you're on the air
[1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:06.580]  hey alex uh just want to say ditto on the uh the new movie
[1:18:06.580 --> 1:18:11.460]  looks pretty good thank you also having a uh a large screening party at my home i
[1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:14.820]  have about uh 85 people or so signed up at my work
[1:18:14.820 --> 1:18:17.620]  to come to a private viewing of my home this weekend so that should be pretty
[1:18:17.620 --> 1:18:21.220]  interesting and you'll have fun and hang out and and everybody will wake up
[1:18:21.220 --> 1:18:24.180]  together and and become free people again
[1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:28.420]  and create communities instead of everybody going to a sports game in a
[1:18:28.420 --> 1:18:30.660]  false community around issues that don't matter
[1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:34.900]  or playing all these group video games where everybody gets so obsessed about
[1:18:34.900 --> 1:18:38.900]  a little game that doesn't matter instead you're forming real community
[1:18:38.900 --> 1:18:44.100]  against the globalist exactly um but i did have uh three minor points i want
[1:18:44.100 --> 1:18:48.580]  to bring up um i work for a larger financial institution
[1:18:48.580 --> 1:18:51.860]  that does uh private funding for retail credit cards
[1:18:51.860 --> 1:18:56.900]  um we have a lot of offices nationwide but we had a company email come out
[1:18:56.900 --> 1:19:02.100]  uh in regards to h1n1 and the seasonal flu shot now basically what this
[1:19:02.100 --> 1:19:06.100]  boils down to is that they're taking a registration who is willing to take it
[1:19:06.100 --> 1:19:10.900]  and who's not willing to take it so what i got my email box two weeks ago was a
[1:19:10.900 --> 1:19:15.780]  registration form where you either check yes i'll take it or no i won't
[1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:19.300]  so i'm and they're categorizing they admit through the census and other
[1:19:19.300 --> 1:19:24.500]  federal programs they're getting maps of what areas are vaccinated what areas
[1:19:24.500 --> 1:19:28.500]  aren't so they're creating this list which can be integrated into the no fly

[1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:21.780]  justin you were bringing up the waiver form was this a waiver
[1:24:21.780 --> 1:24:26.020]  saying oh you understand you're not protected now kind of a psychological
[1:24:26.020 --> 1:24:30.740]  manipulation or was it a waiver that you saw that you would have had to sign
[1:24:30.740 --> 1:24:35.060]  if you took the shot well basically what it breaks down to is is
[1:24:35.060 --> 1:24:38.740]  if you take the shot you waver your right or your rights to
[1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:42.900]  basically it comes down to this protected health information and it says
[1:24:42.900 --> 1:24:46.100]  they can disclose your information to anyone for any purpose and
[1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:50.340]  it gives a big breakdown of government institutions that can subpoena for that
[1:24:50.340 --> 1:24:54.420]  um for special interests and so on so forth and i'm just going to go ahead
[1:24:54.420 --> 1:24:58.020]  and scan it and send you guys a copy so were they trying to make you sign this
[1:24:58.020 --> 1:25:02.260]  if you didn't take it or make you sign it if you did take it if you did take it
[1:25:02.260 --> 1:25:06.580]  however but with that email they are registering who is not taking it as
[1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:09.620]  well and all throughout our building there's things promoting you know you
[1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:12.900]  better take your shot if you don't get your shot you know you're going to get
[1:25:12.900 --> 1:25:15.860]  sick if you're pregnant you better get a shot your kids going to get sick and
[1:25:15.860 --> 1:25:20.180]  all this is with the flu shot is a giant concerted effort
[1:25:20.180 --> 1:25:23.780]  of the united nations giving the united states orders and then the federal
[1:25:23.780 --> 1:25:27.700]  government giving orders to not just the states and counties and cities
[1:25:27.700 --> 1:25:32.900]  but private institutions hospitals banks everywhere
[1:25:32.900 --> 1:25:37.140]  testing what local managers what ceo's
[1:25:37.140 --> 1:25:41.460]  will follow the orders to aggressively push this on people in all over the
[1:25:41.460 --> 1:25:43.300]  country they're not just telling medical
[1:25:43.300 --> 1:25:45.220]  workers they'll be fired if they don't take it
[1:25:45.220 --> 1:25:48.900]  they're telling people working at factories and grocery stores and
[1:25:48.900 --> 1:25:52.340]  in shipyards that they'll be fired there's no law
[1:25:52.340 --> 1:25:55.940]  but it's it's a type of corporate tyranny of slavery
[1:25:55.940 --> 1:26:00.260]  where you're threatened with your job if you don't do it and this is racketeering
[1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:03.860]  by the private vaccine makers in an organized group
[1:26:03.860 --> 1:26:07.460]  criminally trying to force you to take their product
[1:26:07.460 --> 1:26:11.860]  and it's outrageous absolutely and you know i i do have to get in the works
[1:26:11.860 --> 1:26:15.300]  so i'll be short with this uh icing on the cake
[1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:19.700]  they are offering you a 20 discount on your health insurance
[1:26:19.700 --> 1:26:23.380]  through the company if you do sign up for the shot so they are offering a type
[1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:26.420]  of incentive if you want to volunteer excuse me
[1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:30.580]  health insurance on average is what five six seven thousand dollars a year
[1:26:30.580 --> 1:26:34.500]  so we're talking about a thousand dollar or more
[1:26:34.500 --> 1:26:38.020]  discount on your insurance if you take the shot
[1:26:38.020 --> 1:26:41.380]  ladies and gentlemen this is bigger than just the vaccine maker making a hundred
[1:26:41.380 --> 1:26:44.020]  bucks from the federal grant to give it to you
[1:26:44.020 --> 1:26:47.700]  why do they want that shot in you so bad more importantly
[1:26:47.700 --> 1:26:53.220]  they want to set the precedent to force you to take inoculations so in the
[1:26:53.220 --> 1:26:56.660]  future you're not just going to get a discount you're going to be
[1:26:56.660 --> 1:27:02.340]  penalized if you don't take it absolutely well again i'll uh i'll
[1:27:02.340 --> 1:27:06.900]  go ahead and mail you guys or uh shoot you a scan copy of this form
[1:27:06.900 --> 1:27:09.940]  but uh just want to say thank you very much and uh continue the fight
[1:27:09.940 --> 1:27:12.820]  yeah i know you're busy at work but give me a favor write a short blurb
[1:27:12.820 --> 1:27:17.860]  describing it send it to writers at infowars.com
[1:27:17.860 --> 1:27:21.220]  as an attachment and we will post it up on the site
[1:27:21.220 --> 1:27:24.660]  thank you so much great call from Justin
[1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:28.580]  and i had seen reports where they're giving you insurance incentives
[1:27:28.580 --> 1:27:32.580]  discounts i hadn't heard of a 20 percent discount
[1:27:32.580 --> 1:27:39.540]  i mean that is massive but this is to set the precedent to prime the pump
[1:27:39.540 --> 1:27:44.980]  to incentivize mass adoption of forced inoculations
[1:27:44.980 --> 1:27:47.780]  and we know that they're spending billions and billions of dollars of
[1:27:47.780 --> 1:27:50.900]  federal and state money paying off local businesses paying
[1:27:50.900 --> 1:27:54.660]  off churches paying off hospitals and public schools
[1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:59.140]  to try to push this that's why all over the country
[1:27:59.140 --> 1:28:02.740]  every day scores of reports come out we covered them here we post them
[1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:08.420]  on infowars.com and prismplanet.com we get reports confirmed where the
[1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:12.100]  schools are forcibly inoculating children and when they get caught
[1:28:12.100 --> 1:28:17.220]  they say oops we're sorry it's being done on purpose this is authoritarianism
[1:28:17.220 --> 1:28:21.940]  this is the open criminal expansion of government through private interest it's
[1:28:21.940 --> 1:28:25.060]  it's just amazing. Kyle in California thanks for holding
[1:28:25.060 --> 1:28:29.620]  you're on the air. How's it going today Alex? Good.
[1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:33.300]  Yeah i just had an issue i wanted to talk about here with tazering
[1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:36.900]  i saw that video the other day of the guy getting tazered with just his hands
[1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:39.700]  on the front hood of the car there in Minneapolis
[1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:43.380]  and it reminded me of an incident that happened here in my town a few weeks
[1:28:43.380 --> 1:28:47.300]  back i had a friend uh he's actually a marine corps veteran um
[1:28:47.300 --> 1:28:50.740]  a rack veteran and uh he got tazed by the police
[1:28:50.740 --> 1:28:54.660]  uh for absolutely no reason other than uh standing up for the one other guy who
[1:28:54.660 --> 1:28:57.620]  was being surrounded by the four police officers
[1:28:57.620 --> 1:29:00.660]  it's absolutely criminal what these people are doing and um it's totally
[1:29:00.660 --> 1:29:02.420]  despicable as well that they would do that to
[1:29:02.420 --> 1:29:06.020]  well the police have been told they and i'm gonna hold you over the police have
[1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:10.500]  been told this is being done for pain compliance
[1:29:10.500 --> 1:29:15.540]  and it's on record a judge in new york said they can tazer you
[1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:20.420]  to make you answer questions and they're tazering people who won't give urine
[1:29:20.420 --> 1:29:23.940]  samples they're tazering people that say i have rights
[1:29:23.940 --> 1:29:28.580]  to where if you don't submit verbally or you don't answer questions they're
[1:29:28.580 --> 1:29:31.780]  going to torture you so all of america's being turned into a
[1:29:31.780 --> 1:29:36.100]  giant camp x-ray or abu graib and you say hey he's a marine
[1:29:36.100 --> 1:29:39.220]  corps veteran they want to attack him even more
[1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:43.380]  the mayac and homeland security reports state that it's the veterans that are
[1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:47.060]  hated unless you're a veteran and become a police officer
[1:29:47.060 --> 1:29:51.220]  then you become a god we'll be right back

[1:33:34.420 --> 1:33:39.460]  how much all this one human life
[1:33:39.780 --> 1:33:47.220]  what happened to peace on earth the police have been given less lethal
[1:33:47.220 --> 1:33:50.900]  weapons so they can blur the lines and start
[1:33:50.900 --> 1:33:55.700]  attacking the people and so it will be accepted
[1:33:55.700 --> 1:34:01.700]  pregnant women you name it get tasered if they just say no i'm not
[1:34:01.700 --> 1:34:05.460]  going to sign the ticket the cop could then just arrest them but they don't
[1:34:05.460 --> 1:34:10.260]  they taser them to punish them
[1:34:11.540 --> 1:34:15.540]  i mean you didn't see police 20 years ago saying no demonstrations allowed or
[1:34:15.540 --> 1:34:19.620]  no one allowed on the streets of a major city like we saw in pittsburgh at g20
[1:34:19.620 --> 1:34:23.540]  and we witnessed old women coming out of stores
[1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:28.100]  with bags in their hands and saying i'm not allowed on the street officer i'm
[1:34:28.100 --> 1:34:31.620]  shopping the cops just turned the german shepherd loose on them and they
[1:34:31.620 --> 1:34:36.020]  bite them and the blood starts dripping
[1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:40.180]  and then everyone was submitting three days into it the g20 had ended on
[1:34:40.180 --> 1:34:42.900]  friday night the cops were all masked up by the
[1:34:42.900 --> 1:34:45.540]  thousands in their riot gear with national guard driving around with
[1:34:45.540 --> 1:34:49.140]  sound cannons blasting nine-year-olds playing football in their front yards in
[1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:53.140]  the afternoon they drove in to the university
[1:34:53.140 --> 1:34:56.340]  where the college students were out in the park
[1:34:56.340 --> 1:35:00.900]  and said leave and then attacked them this was all on local news local news
[1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:04.740]  admitted it and you'd have young women on bikes
[1:35:04.740 --> 1:35:08.820]  trying to run and the police would charge out block them and then slam
[1:35:08.820 --> 1:35:12.500]  their heads into the ground and bludgeon them with
[1:35:12.500 --> 1:35:19.540]  batons i mean it's crazy it's crazy that is tyranny that is soviet russia
[1:35:19.540 --> 1:35:22.580]  that's communist china
[1:35:23.140 --> 1:35:26.660]  the establishment knows there's going to be mass protests and demonstrations
[1:35:26.660 --> 1:35:29.620]  and calls to arrest the bankers and calls for justice
[1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:33.060]  so they've been slowly training the police and acclimating them
[1:35:33.060 --> 1:35:36.820]  that it's normal procedure and that they're in the right and that it's good
[1:35:36.820 --> 1:35:41.380]  through peer pressure to be macho with a bunch of old women and
[1:35:41.380 --> 1:35:45.780]  college kids and a lie
[1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:50.420]  and to engage in corruption going back to kyle in california kyle finish up
[1:35:50.420 --> 1:35:53.220]  your point uh... yeah that's what this was i mean the way
[1:35:53.220 --> 1:35:56.580]  i look at this is it's basically electrocution until compliance
[1:35:56.580 --> 1:36:01.140]  and which brings up an eerie resemblance to 1984 and what happens to winston in
[1:36:01.140 --> 1:36:04.740]  room 101 in the ministry of love where he's continually
[1:36:04.740 --> 1:36:09.220]  electrocuted through his spine until he believes that two plus two equals five
[1:36:09.220 --> 1:36:12.820]  and this is absolutely horrible the fact that they do it on unarmed people
[1:36:12.820 --> 1:36:17.140]  is cowardly i mean i can't believe how they would even do something like that
[1:36:17.140 --> 1:36:19.700]  uh... the other issue i want to bring up to you alex is that we are doing
[1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:22.420]  something about this there's going to be an agenda item here in our city
[1:36:22.420 --> 1:36:24.180]  council and we're going to be bringing this up
[1:36:24.180 --> 1:36:27.940]  because this whole idea that they can taser people who don't have any weapons
[1:36:27.940 --> 1:36:31.940]  on them uh... is completely against what they all told us what tasers were
[1:36:31.940 --> 1:36:33.460]  going to be for which was a
[1:36:33.460 --> 1:36:37.380]  a supposed non-lethal way to stop people that had a lethal weapon
[1:36:37.380 --> 1:36:40.420]  i also want to let you know we've been putting your films out in public access
[1:36:40.420 --> 1:36:43.540]  here and getting a really good reception from all the people in the
[1:36:43.540 --> 1:36:46.180]  they keep calling us to ask for more videos
[1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:50.420]  um so far in games up there fall the republic camp fema
[1:36:50.420 --> 1:36:53.460]  people are really starting to wake up i think
[1:36:53.460 --> 1:36:56.660]  good job my friend god bless you and keep it up kyle
[1:36:56.660 --> 1:36:59.460]  you know i talked in the last few days about watching
[1:36:59.460 --> 1:37:05.620]  transformers revenge of the fallen and all of the messages that were in it
[1:37:05.620 --> 1:37:10.020]  and one of the messages was torture is good
[1:37:10.020 --> 1:37:14.740]  and over and over again the good guys taser people
[1:37:14.740 --> 1:37:18.980]  and taser their friends and it's funny and happy and cute
[1:37:18.980 --> 1:37:22.100]  and that's why they taser police in their training to teach them that it's no
[1:37:22.100 --> 1:37:25.620]  big deal but the police only take a tiny
[1:37:25.620 --> 1:37:27.620]  jolt when they actually get you on the ground
[1:37:27.620 --> 1:37:31.060]  they taser you over and over and over again
[1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:34.580]  and i don't watch a lot of movies i don't watch a ton of television though i do
[1:37:34.580 --> 1:37:37.940]  monitor it and i can't tell you how many movies
[1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:40.340]  i've seen that have come out in the last few years
[1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:45.300]  where tasering is cute and funny and everybody laughs
[1:37:45.300 --> 1:37:48.660]  just like i see all these movies where torture is funny and everybody laughs
[1:37:48.660 --> 1:37:52.900]  that happens in transformers revenge of the fallen
[1:37:52.900 --> 1:37:56.260]  there's this robot that's very childlike and cute and funny and they torture it
[1:37:56.260 --> 1:37:58.820]  and burn his eyes out and he giggles and likes it and
[1:37:58.820 --> 1:38:02.580]  it's cute and the beautiful girl does it and he turns out being their friend and
[1:38:02.580 --> 1:38:06.420]  likes him and thanks him for burning his eyes out
[1:38:07.620 --> 1:38:11.460]  i mean there the federal government is paying
[1:38:11.460 --> 1:38:16.180]  to acclimate you that death and murder and torture and tasering is good
[1:38:16.180 --> 1:38:19.940]  and police all over the country say answer my question if you don't answer
[1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:23.700]  they taser you that is torture
[1:38:23.780 --> 1:38:28.740]  let's take another call wide open phones billman in florida you're on the air
[1:38:28.740 --> 1:38:33.540]  how's it going alex good sir good settle down a little you've been fired up this
[1:38:33.540 --> 1:38:36.980]  week man you had me fired up the other day i came home
[1:38:36.980 --> 1:38:41.220]  uh industry i work in both my roommates uh they recently got married
[1:38:41.220 --> 1:38:46.740]  worked in the same industry but they're they directly supplement the military
[1:38:46.740 --> 1:38:52.900]  in non-combat services so came home and started talking with them about uh
[1:38:52.900 --> 1:38:56.340]  everything nine eleven in the war in the military and
[1:38:56.340 --> 1:39:00.660]  they pretty much follow suit as far as they go they have the same brainwashing
[1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:04.660]  they they pretty much think that we shouldn't even protest the war that
[1:39:04.660 --> 1:39:08.820]  you know that we're we're making the soldiers insecure and unsure of
[1:39:08.820 --> 1:39:12.740]  themselves sending them over there and i don't know it's it's just pathetic
[1:39:12.740 --> 1:39:16.660]  that the lines that they think along but talking about a
[1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:20.420]  talking about the flu shot up in swine flu my company actually
[1:39:20.420 --> 1:39:24.740]  offers them for free uh the regular flu shot at my work
[1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:28.340]  and if you can't get it at our work they give you vouchers to go to
[1:39:28.340 --> 1:39:31.860]  wherever wherever else you want to get it and also you can get the uh
[1:39:31.860 --> 1:39:36.820]  the h1n one not there directly so i just wanted to sign up for the regular swine
[1:39:36.820 --> 1:39:40.580]  flu to go there maybe like because i see the nurses there every time i go there
[1:39:40.580 --> 1:39:42.820]  to the doctor i wanted to maybe let them know
[1:39:42.820 --> 1:39:46.740]  you know what they're subjecting themselves in us too and and maybe open
[1:39:46.740 --> 1:39:49.300]  the eyes of some of the other people that i work with but it seems like they're
[1:39:49.300 --> 1:39:52.660]  they're pushing it back they push my date back until
[1:39:52.660 --> 1:39:55.860]  november but i canceled it i'm wondering if they're if they're pushing these back
[1:39:55.860 --> 1:39:59.060]  versus for some reason because people aren't taking the regular swine flu and
[1:39:59.060 --> 1:40:02.100]  they want yes were you listening yesterday we played a council in
[1:40:02.100 --> 1:40:05.620]  foreign relations yeah and actually yesterday they
[1:40:05.620 --> 1:40:09.220]  were talking about you know how it how it's directly pushed through the works
[1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:13.060]  in schools and it's not being um the clinics aren't pushing a lot but i
[1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:17.620]  went to cvs the other day and on my cvs bag is printed up on the swine flu and
[1:40:17.620 --> 1:40:22.260]  uh you know come take it here and uh even the local dentist have their signs up
[1:40:22.260 --> 1:40:25.540]  about you know you don't want the swine flu go get your oink
[1:40:25.540 --> 1:40:28.340]  man you know they're even supporting you know the
[1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:31.940]  it's a total it's a total push i appreciate your call that's an
[1:40:31.940 --> 1:40:35.060]  important information
[1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:40.980]  the council on foreign relations released a audio blog of one of their
[1:40:40.980 --> 1:40:43.860]  meetings where these government officials heads of
[1:40:43.860 --> 1:40:47.300]  universities top health care
[1:40:47.300 --> 1:40:53.300]  executives are talking about oh my gosh the conspiracy theorists the crazies are
[1:40:53.300 --> 1:40:56.100]  telling people don't take the flu shot and it's dangerous
[1:40:56.100 --> 1:40:59.700]  what are we going to do and one of them says well we can say that there's not
[1:40:59.700 --> 1:41:04.260]  enough of it create a shortage at first so people panic and want it that's
[1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:09.380]  artificial scarcity they create the perception that there's a lack of it
[1:41:09.380 --> 1:41:14.580]  that it's something precious they announce that there's free shots
[1:41:14.580 --> 1:41:19.300]  everybody shows up they have none of the shots on hand by design
[1:41:19.300 --> 1:41:22.900]  to create the panic and and we had already announced that they were clearly
[1:41:22.900 --> 1:41:27.060]  doing that and then now they admit that that's their plan
[1:41:27.060 --> 1:41:30.580]  everything is about manipulating the population
[1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:36.100]  and the manipulation is sophisticated but if you're aware of the manipulation
[1:41:36.100 --> 1:41:41.380]  it's powerless it can do nothing to you it loses all of its power
[1:41:41.380 --> 1:41:45.860]  and we are no longer powerless and so it's an awakening process is taking
[1:41:45.860 --> 1:41:48.100]  place
[1:41:48.740 --> 1:41:53.060]  the establishment also will go out and interview 10 20 30 40 people
[1:41:53.060 --> 1:41:56.340]  on the street till they find the one person that thinks the swine flu shot is
[1:41:56.340 --> 1:42:00.020]  great and boy they think everybody should be forced to take it
[1:42:00.020 --> 1:42:02.980]  but then meanwhile you can go out to talk to people on the street the majority
[1:42:02.980 --> 1:42:06.500]  are against it as the polls show so that's another way they do this i mean i've
[1:42:06.500 --> 1:42:10.980]  talked to airport security people one i'm i'm friends with
[1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:16.020]  here in austin and he talked years ago about how he sat there one day
[1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:19.540]  watching news aid austin
[1:42:19.540 --> 1:42:25.220]  talked to more than 30 people and it was his job to stand there while they
[1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:28.820]  interviewed him and he watched every person
[1:42:28.820 --> 1:42:32.020]  say no i think saying we can't have liquids on the plane is stupid i don't
[1:42:32.020 --> 1:42:34.820]  like taking my shoes off this is wrong this is
[1:42:34.820 --> 1:42:38.420]  dumb this is violating my rights i don't like it
[1:42:38.420 --> 1:42:41.940]  and then finally one old lady said she loved it and he knew they were going to
[1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:45.220]  close the tripod turn the camera off and leave and they did
[1:42:45.220 --> 1:42:50.100]  and i saw him up at a local tv station i was at one night
[1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:54.740]  that his brother worked at and he and they were in there watching news eight
[1:42:54.740 --> 1:42:57.220]  and he said i'm waiting for it to come on i'm waiting for it to come on they
[1:42:57.220 --> 1:43:00.980]  said it was coming on at six and i said what's coming on he told me the
[1:43:00.980 --> 1:43:03.700]  story he said watch it's going to be this gray-haired old lady
[1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:07.700]  and they're sitting there watching it and it comes on and it's her
[1:43:07.700 --> 1:43:11.140]  everyone loves it in austin they think the security is great they cut to the one
[1:43:11.140 --> 1:43:14.740]  old lady saying she loves it and he and his brother start laughing and
[1:43:14.740 --> 1:43:18.740]  almost rolling around the ground at the manipulation
[1:43:18.740 --> 1:43:25.140]  so that's the type of tricks they're playing to make you feel like you're
[1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:28.260]  the minority because you don't want a world government or you don't want a
[1:43:28.260 --> 1:43:31.220]  carbon tax or you don't want to force an oculation or you don't want open
[1:43:31.220 --> 1:43:35.300]  borders or you don't want another banker bailout
[1:43:35.300 --> 1:43:38.740]  you're the minority you don't like the jobless recovery
[1:43:38.740 --> 1:43:43.380]  you know you're the majority you're the common sense
[1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:48.180]  and then i even buy into the propaganda and say everybody's stupid everybody's
[1:43:48.180 --> 1:43:51.940]  dumb no everybody isn't stupid and dumb what they are is apathetic and they
[1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:55.700]  need to have their voices heard and get involved
[1:43:55.700 --> 1:43:58.980]  when you heard the caller earlier in california in a town putting my
[1:43:58.980 --> 1:44:02.820]  films on access television beautiful everybody should do that
[1:44:02.820 --> 1:44:06.420]  the feds are shutting access tv down all over the country
[1:44:06.420 --> 1:44:09.380]  the austin access will be shut down within two years
[1:44:09.380 --> 1:44:15.620]  that's official barring a miracle should we pressure city council to keep it
[1:44:15.620 --> 1:44:20.340]  should we use it while it's there my stuff in austin isn't even on the air
[1:44:20.340 --> 1:44:22.820]  anymore some of my old shows that i have are still there
[1:44:22.820 --> 1:44:26.820]  but no one even turns new material in i don't have time or energy
[1:44:26.820 --> 1:44:30.340]  or staff to go do it it's easy but we aren't doing that
[1:44:30.340 --> 1:44:34.420]  that reaches tens of thousands every night listeners in austin should take
[1:44:34.420 --> 1:44:38.100]  my films go down air them
[1:44:38.500 --> 1:44:47.140]  you're authorized to obama deception all the republic they have not aired
[1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:53.700]  there are so many ways to reach people but we had better use them now

[1:48:01.620 --> 1:48:06.580]  swine flu or if they sprayed something in the air
[1:48:06.580 --> 1:48:10.820]  but uh it's supposed to be really really bad over there
[1:48:10.820 --> 1:48:15.780]  yes it's killing me i'm thinking they sprayed something in the air
[1:48:15.780 --> 1:48:20.740]  well well nancy it it it it's killing a large percentage of people as you know
[1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:24.740]  this is in mainstream european news it's killing a large percentage of people
[1:48:24.740 --> 1:48:29.460]  that get it it's a strange uh not seen before virus and uh i'm going to put
[1:48:29.460 --> 1:48:32.100]  you on hold and give you jaren's number okay
[1:48:32.100 --> 1:48:34.980]  you're the best and please give it to james trafficant in a note seeing we
[1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:37.540]  supporting our listeners are asking for him on
[1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:40.580]  we'd like to interview him thank you for doing that for us and that's how we get
[1:48:40.580 --> 1:48:45.700]  so much done as our great listeners um going back to the ukraine
[1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:49.540]  we know that in the check republic ukraine
[1:48:49.540 --> 1:48:55.220]  poland germany and several other countries it was 14
[1:48:55.220 --> 1:48:59.620]  eastern and western european nations london guardian reported on it
[1:48:59.620 --> 1:49:04.740]  so did the telegraph show did a bunch of check republic articles with medical
[1:49:04.740 --> 1:49:08.500]  doctors saying baxter pharmaceutical mixed
[1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:15.140]  weaponized bird flu in with vaccines but thank god a lab tested it
[1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:19.780]  found out and it got stopped but there appears doesn't appear we know there's
[1:49:19.780 --> 1:49:23.780]  a cover-up but but it appears it may be baxter we're not sure
[1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:28.740]  london telegraph and others reported that in trials of an experimental bird
[1:49:28.740 --> 1:49:31.940]  flu vaccine but no one will say what company it was
[1:49:31.940 --> 1:49:35.780]  that the vaccine maker came into poland
[1:49:35.780 --> 1:49:40.580]  and other this is last year and this year and would pay local health
[1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:45.540]  departments to pay homeless people
[1:49:46.260 --> 1:49:51.060]  to take the experimental shot but they told him it was a regular flu shot so
[1:49:51.060 --> 1:49:53.860]  we know that the local authorities the
[1:49:53.860 --> 1:49:59.780]  officials not the servants did this and some of them were arrested in poland
[1:49:59.780 --> 1:50:04.340]  for killing these people 21 of 100 homeless in one town died
[1:50:04.340 --> 1:50:09.380]  they did a 100 person study didn't tell them it was a study 21 died
[1:50:09.380 --> 1:50:12.500]  and we know there's all these other weird flu vaccine
[1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:19.780]  tests being done all over eastern and western europe and so
[1:50:19.780 --> 1:50:23.620]  the best way that that they like to deliver these
[1:50:23.620 --> 1:50:27.620]  live viruses to then mutate and spread is through shots
[1:50:27.620 --> 1:50:30.580]  what was the first vaccine they gave out a month and a half ago
[1:50:30.580 --> 1:50:36.260]  for h1n1 it was the nasal the insert for the vaccine admits it's live
[1:50:36.260 --> 1:50:41.380]  and it admits that it will then breathe in the nasal passages be sneezed out
[1:50:41.380 --> 1:50:46.820]  and spread now that's hidden in plain view so
[1:50:46.820 --> 1:50:49.940]  in fact you're in the break i want the article is one in telegraph just type
[1:50:49.940 --> 1:50:53.860]  homeless died bird flu vaccine and that'll be one in telegraph

[1:54:21.460 --> 1:54:28.980]  we are back live here is one of literally hundreds of articles but most of
[1:54:28.980 --> 1:54:34.340]  them are in german or in check or in polish but they've been
[1:54:34.340 --> 1:54:37.220]  translated into english but this is the London telegraph
[1:54:37.220 --> 1:54:42.180]  homeless people die after bird flu vaccine trial in Poland
[1:54:42.180 --> 1:54:45.780]  three Polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a
[1:54:45.780 --> 1:54:48.340]  number of homeless people died following medical trials
[1:54:48.340 --> 1:54:55.860]  for a vaccine for h5 n1 bird flu virus and then it says that
[1:54:55.860 --> 1:55:00.660]  of a hundred people that was given to um well that this article says 350
[1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:05.300]  homeless people were given it 21 died in just one test in one town
[1:55:05.300 --> 1:55:10.100]  that says 21 people from this center died so far so from one
[1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:14.580]  homeless center 21 died of the shot and it says that they've been died and
[1:55:14.580 --> 1:55:18.580]  arrested them but it says a unnamed pharmacological
[1:55:18.580 --> 1:55:24.740]  company paid them to do this so i just wanted to bring this
[1:55:24.740 --> 1:55:27.380]  article back to people we're not just up here saying
[1:55:27.380 --> 1:55:30.740]  this is happening so you see a bunch of people dying in Ukraine
[1:55:30.740 --> 1:55:33.700]  i bet my bottom dollar they were given a vaccine
[1:55:33.700 --> 1:55:36.820]  because in eastern europe the governments are so corrupt the media is so
[1:55:36.820 --> 1:55:42.740]  corrupt uh but a lot of their media is good
[1:55:42.740 --> 1:55:45.940]  it's just the system is accustomed to committing these crimes out in the open
[1:55:45.940 --> 1:55:48.580]  there and so this is going on so i would
[1:55:48.580 --> 1:55:50.820]  imagine that's what's happening with the Ukraine right now
[1:55:50.820 --> 1:55:55.940]  we'll ask medical doctor rima labo that and major general stubblebine
[1:55:55.940 --> 1:56:00.180]  on the other side of this break when we start simulcasting at prismplanet.tv
[1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:03.780]  i have a press release here gary franchi and william louis we're here in studio

[1:56:21.300 --> 1:56:24.340]  they still go out and sell them and then it really hurts you
[1:56:24.340 --> 1:56:28.020]  and it's hurt us but all i care about is getting the word out
[1:56:28.020 --> 1:56:32.820]  and uh there are a few people i've had to go after
[1:56:32.820 --> 1:56:36.180]  when it gets too egregious but i want you to get fall the republic and make
[1:56:36.180 --> 1:56:39.380]  copies i'm begging you to do it and gary franchi of

[1:57:43.300 --> 1:57:47.060]  we are the most successful of anybody out there
[1:57:47.060 --> 1:57:51.140]  at viral free films online over a hundred million conservatively
[1:57:51.140 --> 1:57:55.140]  of my last four films over a hundred million people have seen it
[1:57:55.140 --> 1:58:01.300]  mainstream media has even reported that but i'm not successful at selling them
[1:58:01.300 --> 1:58:04.900]  but i got some sponsors and other things and i kind of lean on the
[1:58:04.900 --> 1:58:07.140]  sponsorship and then people even complain about that
[1:58:07.140 --> 1:58:10.820]  but that's mainly co-intel pro folks that would just whine and vetch about
[1:58:10.820 --> 1:58:15.620]  being given you know the keys of the city on a silver platter

[2:02:12.740 --> 2:02:18.420]  um we've been attending the 31st session of the codex committee on
[2:02:18.420 --> 2:02:21.780]  nutrition and food for special dietary uses
[2:02:21.780 --> 2:02:25.540]  which is referred to for shorter cc n f s d u
[2:02:25.540 --> 2:02:28.740]  it's a genocidal tool if ever there was one
[2:02:28.740 --> 2:02:32.820]  and there's been a lot of um confirmation of that
[2:02:32.820 --> 2:02:36.820]  but right now and i hope we'll have a chance to talk about this
[2:02:36.820 --> 2:02:41.460]  we're looking at a two pronged attack a two prong genocidal attack
[2:02:41.460 --> 2:02:44.900]  by your friend in mind the world health organization
[2:02:44.900 --> 2:02:48.980]  it's quite um it's quite obvious and it's quite
[2:02:48.980 --> 2:02:53.620]  scary absolutely and then i of course want to get
[2:02:53.620 --> 2:02:57.780]  the latest breakdown the overview from the general
[2:02:57.780 --> 2:03:02.740]  about this eugenics program what the whole flu vaccine push is about
[2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:06.020]  uh the fact that people are in record numbers resisting it
[2:03:06.020 --> 2:03:09.460]  and what you think is next in their game plan but we're going to go to break in
[2:03:09.460 --> 2:03:13.540]  a moment but but go ahead and start defining the two pronged attack
[2:03:13.540 --> 2:03:17.220]  and what codex alimentarius is for those that don't know codex
[2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:23.620]  alimentarius is the united nations commission which was created in 1962
[2:03:23.620 --> 2:03:30.900]  at the request of convicted crimes against humanity war criminals
[2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:36.020]  uh fritz termir who was the head of bayer pharmaceutical before he became
[2:03:36.020 --> 2:03:40.340]  the head of ig carbon the german civilian war machine
[2:03:40.340 --> 2:03:45.860]  arm uh financed of course by the usual gang of suspects that we know
[2:03:45.860 --> 2:03:50.660]  uh so when he got out of jail and went back to work as the head of bayer
[2:03:50.660 --> 2:03:54.260]  pharmaceutical he called together the other pharmaceutical
[2:03:54.260 --> 2:03:58.980]  executives who used to work for him as uh underlings when he was the head of
[2:03:58.980 --> 2:04:04.420]  ig carbon and he said hey let's suggest that the united
[2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:08.020]  nations take over the world food supply let's write a letter
[2:04:08.020 --> 2:04:13.380]  and suggest that to him they wrote that letter he delivered it in 1952 and the
[2:04:13.380 --> 2:04:18.420]  united nation said what a cool idea and they created the codex
[2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:24.260]  alimentarius which means food code commission which is run jointly by the
[2:04:24.260 --> 2:04:29.860]  world health organization who of recent pandemic fame
[2:04:29.860 --> 2:04:33.380]  and by the food and agriculture organization
[2:04:33.380 --> 2:04:39.700]  their their thrust has been to destroy the integrity of the world food
[2:04:39.700 --> 2:04:43.460]  supply for the sake of pharmaceutical profits

[2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:24.260]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:08:24.260 --> 2:08:31.140]  i have shown this article before but i'm going to show it again
[2:08:31.140 --> 2:08:34.500]  because there were hundreds of these stories all over europe
[2:08:34.500 --> 2:08:37.860]  hundreds alone in the check republic where their top doctors came out and
[2:08:37.860 --> 2:08:42.740]  said baxter pharmaceutical knowingly put bird flu
[2:08:42.740 --> 2:08:46.820]  and tried to put it in the vaccine supply there's no way this was an accident
[2:08:46.820 --> 2:08:50.980]  and then nothing happened then we learned that bird flu by an unnamed
[2:08:50.980 --> 2:08:54.500]  company was mixed in with vaccines all over
[2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:57.540]  and given in secret trials to homeless people
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:00.500]  in one homeless shelter they killed 21 people
[2:09:00.500 --> 2:09:04.900]  this is the london telegraph now the reason i raised this is that we have
[2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:08.740]  cfr meetings we played clips of where they make fun of us and say there's no
[2:09:08.740 --> 2:09:12.340]  mercury no adverse reactions no gillian beret's disorder
[2:09:12.340 --> 2:09:19.060]  no sickness no autoimmune no deaths when every major vaccine always causes this
[2:09:19.060 --> 2:09:22.340]  stuff and when they do have these reactions they say well that's part of
[2:09:22.340 --> 2:09:25.940]  the bad reaction and we expect that to happen and that's an acceptable
[2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:31.860]  loss collateral damage we have dr rimo lebo who is a top medical
[2:09:31.860 --> 2:09:35.300]  doctor joining us and her husband is major general albert n
[2:09:35.300 --> 2:09:40.980]  stubble by and the third u.s army retired and to go over his bio is just
[2:09:40.980 --> 2:09:44.100]  amazing uh he was known as an out-of-the-box
[2:09:44.100 --> 2:09:52.500]  thinker uh who was the head of special forces the head of
[2:09:52.500 --> 2:09:55.700]  different intelligence groups let me just read the bios i don't get it wrong
[2:09:55.700 --> 2:09:58.820]  and then for an hour and 50 minutes we've got both of them
[2:09:58.820 --> 2:10:02.820]  live from germany joining us today with their fighting codex alimentarius and
[2:10:02.820 --> 2:10:07.780]  we'll recap what that is get into the flu the swine flu the bird flu
[2:10:07.780 --> 2:10:11.060]  how school children everywhere being forcibly inoculated
[2:10:11.060 --> 2:10:14.740]  and the talking point when parents get mad or the kids go to the hospital
[2:10:14.740 --> 2:10:19.860]  that's new york daily news is oops burt is a graduate of the u.s military
[2:10:19.860 --> 2:10:22.500]  academy west point class of 52 he enjoyed a
[2:10:22.500 --> 2:10:25.860]  distinguished 32 career in the u.s army he retired as the commanding general
[2:10:25.860 --> 2:10:28.740]  that the united states army intelligence and security command
[2:10:28.740 --> 2:10:31.940]  prior to his assignment he commanded the u.s army electronics research and
[2:10:31.940 --> 2:10:34.980]  development command during his active duty career he commanded
[2:10:34.980 --> 2:10:38.580]  soldiers at every level after his retirement he served as a vp for
[2:10:38.580 --> 2:10:43.060]  intelligence systems b d m a major defense contractor
[2:10:43.060 --> 2:10:47.620]  he brought these experiences to leading edge medical research and development
[2:10:47.620 --> 2:10:51.620]  in collaboration with his wife rima labo and then the bio just goes on and on
[2:10:51.620 --> 2:10:54.820]  and on but all these decades of work and
[2:10:54.820 --> 2:10:57.380]  research even being the head of intelligence
[2:10:57.380 --> 2:11:01.060]  it finally all came into view for him in the last six seven years
[2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:06.500]  and he agrees and past interviews it is the end game mass extermination a total
[2:11:06.500 --> 2:11:11.940]  police state grid to carry the sound and dr labo has treated heads of state
[2:11:11.940 --> 2:11:15.460]  who she's talked to who are aware of the extermination plan and they say they're
[2:11:15.460 --> 2:11:18.340]  sad about it but they have to carry it out but
[2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:23.060]  doctor patient privilege she can't discuss it it's like a reporter can't tell
[2:11:23.060 --> 2:11:26.020]  you their source that's why they tell doctors and pastors and
[2:11:26.020 --> 2:11:29.780]  lawyers and psychologists things like this so they're both with us and i don't
[2:11:29.780 --> 2:11:31.700]  know where to start with everything that's happening
[2:11:31.700 --> 2:11:34.740]  again your ecodex alimentary has hit that first
[2:11:34.740 --> 2:11:39.300]  what we're facing then the flu the forced inoculations that are going on
[2:11:39.300 --> 2:11:42.980]  covertly and an ambient level being turned up slowly
[2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:46.820]  is this all a command and control beta test for future pandemics
[2:11:46.820 --> 2:11:51.060]  dr rima labo and of course major general albert instable behind the third
[2:11:51.060 --> 2:11:56.100]  welcome well thank you so much alex um let's
[2:11:56.100 --> 2:11:59.460]  let's finish talking about codex which i think is
[2:11:59.460 --> 2:12:04.100]  um a long-term genocidal weapon of the globalist
[2:12:04.100 --> 2:12:09.540]  and then link it to the vaccine which is a shorter term
[2:12:09.540 --> 2:12:15.700]  immediate assault but it's against that's against the backdrop
[2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:19.300]  of the long-term poisoning of the immune system
[2:12:19.300 --> 2:12:24.500]  of the people of the planet now those are very very strong words happily
[2:12:24.500 --> 2:12:28.820]  the people who listen to your show are used to those strong words often when
[2:12:28.820 --> 2:12:32.660]  we talk about this people glaze over and go dumb
[2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:37.300]  but um i think your listeners are prepared for this information and that's
[2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:42.180]  that's terrific um we are at the codex meeting
[2:12:42.180 --> 2:12:46.500]  where the infamous dr ralph growth clout
[2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:53.940]  is presiding over a an international body that is looking at and making
[2:12:53.940 --> 2:12:58.340]  standards and guidelines and setting limits
[2:12:58.340 --> 2:13:03.140]  for nutrients and foods for special dietary uses
[2:13:03.140 --> 2:13:06.180]  what does that mean that means food for babies
[2:13:06.180 --> 2:13:13.220]  weaning infants um sick people and they are also bringing to
[2:13:13.220 --> 2:13:19.860]  fruition a program to limit nutrients which we in the
[2:13:19.860 --> 2:13:23.220]  united states are used to having at any
[2:13:23.220 --> 2:13:26.580]  dosage that we want high potency nutrients
[2:13:26.580 --> 2:13:30.340]  are for instance part of how i practice medicine
[2:13:30.340 --> 2:13:35.860]  and how i live as a matter of fact and they are for about 131 million people
[2:13:35.860 --> 2:13:40.740]  in the united states as well today and yesterday
[2:13:40.740 --> 2:13:44.900]  the united states delegate barbara schneiman
[2:13:44.900 --> 2:13:51.380]  at this meeting made it clear once again that the fda and she is the head of the
[2:13:51.380 --> 2:13:55.620]  dietary supplements office at the fda the fda is
[2:13:55.620 --> 2:13:59.860]  perfectly comfortable working with an international body of
[2:13:59.860 --> 2:14:04.660]  unelected bureaucrats to eliminate high potency
[2:14:04.660 --> 2:14:09.940]  nutrients that means to bring down your maximum permissible
[2:14:09.940 --> 2:14:16.260]  upper limit of for instance vitamin c to 45
[2:14:16.260 --> 2:14:22.820]  milligrams a day vitamin d to five international units
[2:14:22.820 --> 2:14:29.700]  per day i personally take 10 000 units the limit the legal limit will be five
[2:14:29.700 --> 2:14:34.020]  with or without a prescription um vitamin b
[2:14:34.020 --> 2:14:42.100]  six 1.3 milligrams biotin i take 8 000
[2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:46.100]  milligrams of biotin micrograms i'm sorry biotin per day
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:50.420]  the upper limit will be 30 um and so it goes
[2:14:50.420 --> 2:14:56.180]  item after item however the one item that will be permitted in a high
[2:14:56.180 --> 2:15:06.020]  level is ta-da fluoride at either 3.5 milligrams per day which is an
[2:15:06.020 --> 2:15:11.060]  astounding amount of the neurotoxic endocrine toxic
[2:15:11.060 --> 2:15:16.420]  bone toxic poison which makes people sheep-like
[2:15:16.420 --> 2:15:23.300]  or four milligrams per day these are astounding amounts and
[2:15:23.300 --> 2:15:27.620]  dr schneiman in a little piece of theater
[2:15:27.620 --> 2:15:32.340]  that uh i did a video about and that uh you can read about it our website
[2:15:32.340 --> 2:15:37.300]  healthfreedomusa.org and our
[2:15:37.300 --> 2:15:41.380]  blogs i'm sorry blogs and blasts uh that we
[2:15:41.380 --> 2:15:45.060]  put out during the codex meeting on a daily basis
[2:15:45.060 --> 2:15:51.220]  dr schneiman said you know i think that since nutrients are food and they are
[2:15:51.220 --> 2:15:57.540]  under u.s law then the nutrition nutrient
[2:15:57.540 --> 2:16:02.900]  upper limits should apply to them as well on a global basis that's in
[2:16:02.900 --> 2:16:08.580]  violation of u.s law so the game is to make sure
[2:16:08.580 --> 2:16:13.540]  that nutrients are available in such low doses
[2:16:13.540 --> 2:16:19.780]  that they can do no good why well think about this for a moment
[2:16:19.780 --> 2:16:24.340]  the world health organization says that the non-communicable
[2:16:24.340 --> 2:16:30.980]  preventable diseases of under nutrition under nutrition are cancer
[2:16:30.980 --> 2:16:35.940]  cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and obesity
[2:16:35.940 --> 2:16:39.220]  those five diseases are the principal killers
[2:16:39.220 --> 2:16:43.620]  of the developed world and increasingly the developing world
[2:16:43.620 --> 2:16:46.980]  and they're also the principal money makers so
[2:16:46.980 --> 2:16:54.100]  if you mandate global malnutrition which this does the nutrient reference value
[2:16:54.100 --> 2:16:58.180]  upper limits mandates global malnutrition
[2:16:58.180 --> 2:17:05.300]  under nutrition and then you have the pharmaceutical company
[2:17:05.300 --> 2:17:09.940]  making lots and lots of money from the chronic degenerative diseases of under
[2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:13.380]  nutrition while people die from their deadly
[2:17:13.380 --> 2:17:18.900]  treatments what you have is depopulation for a profit
[2:17:18.900 --> 2:17:22.660]  and it is in essence codex but then
[2:17:22.660 --> 2:17:30.340]  you segue right over to the next WHO program which is vaccine
[2:17:30.340 --> 2:17:37.460]  go ahead before she segues let me just add a little
[2:17:37.460 --> 2:17:44.180]  tidbit to all of this because everything you know if if it were presented
[2:17:44.180 --> 2:17:48.740]  to you as a genocidal program you would say
[2:17:48.740 --> 2:17:52.500]  what you'd get on your hind leg then you'd scream
[2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:56.660]  and you wouldn't wouldn't stand for it however
[2:17:56.660 --> 2:18:00.820]  all of this was done by saying oh don't worry
[2:18:00.820 --> 2:18:05.780]  don't worry don't worry all we're doing is putting these
[2:18:05.780 --> 2:18:12.260]  uh values on the labels so that you will know
[2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:17.700]  what you're getting and it will it it will have no impact at all you'll just
[2:18:17.700 --> 2:18:20.820]  have uh have the knowledge so that you can
[2:18:20.820 --> 2:18:25.300]  select what you want as a consumer yeah as a consumer
[2:18:25.300 --> 2:18:32.340]  and what they don't tell you is that uh the plan eventually will be
[2:18:32.340 --> 2:18:36.580]  that the only way that you can do international trade with all of this
[2:18:36.580 --> 2:18:42.100]  is to be under these limits and they they do tell each other they just don't
[2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:44.420]  tell the public they don't tell the public
[2:18:44.420 --> 2:18:48.740]  that eventually in order to do international trade
[2:18:48.740 --> 2:18:52.660]  you will have to live by these limits
[2:18:52.660 --> 2:18:56.980]  and therefore there will be no international trade
[2:18:56.980 --> 2:19:02.740]  of anything bigger than what these uh are uh these limits that they've said
[2:19:02.740 --> 2:19:07.060]  at this meeting but what happens but what happens
[2:19:07.060 --> 2:19:13.620]  is that the united states government on october 11th 1994 the FDA
[2:19:13.620 --> 2:19:17.300]  announced in the federal register that it is committed to
[2:19:17.300 --> 2:19:22.980]  harmonizing with and that needs to have the first four letters capitalized
[2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:27.060]  h-a-r-m it is committed to harmonizing
[2:19:27.060 --> 2:19:33.700]  with the codex standards whether or not they violate us
[2:19:33.700 --> 2:19:38.100]  we're going to have these limits set for us
[2:19:38.100 --> 2:19:42.100]  by the FDA in spite of the fact that us law
[2:19:42.100 --> 2:19:45.620]  prohibits that now doctor we've got a break
[2:19:45.620 --> 2:19:48.980]  general we've got a break we're going to come back and continue and then get
[2:19:48.980 --> 2:19:53.300]  into the other side of the pincer the vaccines
[2:19:53.300 --> 2:19:57.140]  i hope people realize the magnitude of what they're hearing
[2:19:57.140 --> 2:20:00.340]  we'll be right back stay with us

[2:24:13.380 --> 2:24:18.100]  i remember four years ago nationally
[2:24:18.100 --> 2:24:22.340]  the news reported in local news reported that the federal government had done two
[2:24:22.340 --> 2:24:25.860]  studies finding that mercury was actually good for
[2:24:25.860 --> 2:24:30.020]  children's brains and we played those video clips
[2:24:30.020 --> 2:24:35.780]  off the news many times here then i was at the store and i heard
[2:24:35.780 --> 2:24:41.780]  that since they had said mercury was now a a a supplement
[2:24:41.780 --> 2:24:47.620]  that they were putting it in products and i found a whole bunch of products
[2:24:47.620 --> 2:24:55.300]  where on the back it says mercury and right there on this product it says
[2:24:55.300 --> 2:24:57.860]  mercury
[2:24:58.980 --> 2:25:03.540]  listed as one of the minerals when it's a heavy metal
[2:25:05.060 --> 2:25:08.980]  and i found a lot of products doing this and they have said and i've heard
[2:25:08.980 --> 2:25:12.420]  dr. dinell who's their spokesman on radio he says we've
[2:25:12.420 --> 2:25:15.300]  interviewed him that vitamins are bad for you you can hear him any
[2:25:15.300 --> 2:25:20.900]  weekday saying it uh saying that we all need to not take them and that people
[2:25:20.900 --> 2:25:24.500]  are crazy so this is the the universe inverted
[2:25:24.500 --> 2:25:28.660]  into pure insanity and codex alimentarius it's just another power grab
[2:25:28.660 --> 2:25:31.620]  like private groups wanting to pass a carbon tax saying carbon
[2:25:31.620 --> 2:25:36.420]  dioxide's bad when that's what plants breathe
[2:25:36.420 --> 2:25:40.660]  we use oxygen they use carbon dioxide they put off oxygen we breathe it we put
[2:25:40.660 --> 2:25:44.340]  off carbon dioxide they then absorb that that's the carbon cycle
[2:25:44.340 --> 2:25:48.180]  the life cycle and it's the boldness and they're taking
[2:25:48.180 --> 2:25:51.620]  over the banking right now they're taking over the local police right now
[2:25:51.620 --> 2:25:54.900]  they're taking over the health care right now to carry out eugenics
[2:25:54.900 --> 2:25:58.180]  they're taking over the vitamins and the food they're openly announcing they
[2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:01.540]  may shut down the web during emergencies that's associated
[2:26:01.540 --> 2:26:05.300]  press today they really are moving and they're
[2:26:05.300 --> 2:26:09.620]  forcibly inoculating school children nationwide and when kids drop
[2:26:09.620 --> 2:26:13.060]  on the ground have convulsions they say that's the only time it makes it in the
[2:26:13.060 --> 2:26:16.740]  news and they say oh we made a mistake this is a short segment going back to
[2:26:16.740 --> 2:26:20.020]  general stubblebite and then back to dr lebo who's there to
[2:26:20.020 --> 2:26:24.180]  continue with the vaccines but to go over all of this
[2:26:24.180 --> 2:26:30.020]  general the the the overarching program we're witnessing here the takeover by
[2:26:30.020 --> 2:26:34.500]  the globalist at every front they're planned to depopulate
[2:26:34.500 --> 2:26:39.060]  can you give us your wide spectrum analysis of what we're facing because
[2:26:39.060 --> 2:26:43.220]  the evidence is and the and the on the ground intelligence is
[2:26:43.220 --> 2:26:48.100]  and the dots are popping out clearly to where it's a crystal clear 3d image now
[2:26:48.100 --> 2:26:51.380]  that they're making their big move they've launched their world government
[2:26:51.380 --> 2:26:54.660]  they're announcing it they're announcing one-child policies they're
[2:26:54.660 --> 2:26:58.660]  announcing extermination uh what would you call this in military
[2:26:58.660 --> 2:27:03.860]  terms as a major general when they just start bombarding us on every front a
[2:27:03.860 --> 2:27:07.780]  bomb rush is this an attempt to overwhelm what's happening
[2:27:07.780 --> 2:27:13.220]  well certainly if you if you think about it in terms of uh the principles of war
[2:27:13.220 --> 2:27:20.580]  one of those principles is called surprise and so suddenly here they are
[2:27:20.580 --> 2:27:26.340]  hitting you from all sides and you're not sure which way you need to duck in
[2:27:26.340 --> 2:27:30.660]  order to not get hit the second thing that uh
[2:27:30.660 --> 2:27:34.660]  or another one of the principles of war is called mass
[2:27:34.660 --> 2:27:39.860]  and so it and what that means is you put all of your force
[2:27:39.860 --> 2:27:44.820]  on the weakest part of the of the enemy's force
[2:27:44.820 --> 2:27:48.420]  and so what are they doing they're hitting you from
[2:27:48.420 --> 2:27:52.500]  every single solitary direction with a mass
[2:27:52.500 --> 2:27:58.100]  of different kinds of things and how do you then expect to fight back
[2:27:58.100 --> 2:28:02.420]  you have trouble because you're ducking from every different direction
[2:28:02.420 --> 2:28:05.620]  and you're trying to uh uh cover yourself
[2:28:05.620 --> 2:28:08.580]  and one and you're getting hit from another direction
[2:28:08.580 --> 2:28:12.420]  and general as you just said they're targeting the weakest
[2:28:12.420 --> 2:28:16.020]  the doctors the nurses the people being threatened with their jobs the school
[2:28:16.020 --> 2:28:19.540]  children they in all 50 states were getting reports
[2:28:19.540 --> 2:28:24.580]  are forcibly inoculating in plain view the first vaccine is the live
[2:28:24.580 --> 2:28:27.620]  nasal the insert admits that will then breed it
[2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:32.260]  incubate it to spread the real influenza outbreak
[2:28:32.260 --> 2:28:36.580]  uh in in military terminology what is it when they just operate
[2:28:36.580 --> 2:28:44.020]  flagrantly in plain view as well well as the uh about tyranny tyranny
[2:28:44.020 --> 2:28:49.060]  uh but you know when you're when you have all of the cards or you think you
[2:28:49.060 --> 2:28:54.340]  have all of the cards you can do that you can do a frontal assault
[2:28:54.340 --> 2:28:59.860]  uh the soviet used to try it and uh are used to practice it uh in great
[2:28:59.860 --> 2:29:03.860]  length uh all of the time i can remember as a
[2:29:03.860 --> 2:29:08.980]  as a young lieutenant in uh in germany where the soviets would put their
[2:29:08.980 --> 2:29:15.140]  entire army on the line and or in a in a huge mass
[2:29:15.140 --> 2:29:19.540]  and uh move right up to the uh to the border
[2:29:19.540 --> 2:29:25.140]  and expect the uh us to react and then at the last
[2:29:25.140 --> 2:29:27.940]  minute they would do a right blank or a left blank
[2:29:27.940 --> 2:29:33.140]  and go away well these people are doing exactly the same thing except they're
[2:29:33.140 --> 2:29:36.980]  not going away by the way alex name of the company

[2:36:25.700 --> 2:36:30.740]  operations and this this is an enemy an adversary the globalists admit
[2:36:30.740 --> 2:36:34.500]  that they're using fake environmentalism and the global system
[2:36:34.500 --> 2:36:38.980]  to enslave the world population going back to Dr.
[2:36:38.980 --> 2:36:44.900]  Ramilebo and Major General Stubblebine uh Dr. you were mentioning that you had
[2:36:44.900 --> 2:36:48.980]  the answer of the company i have over a hundred articles
[2:36:48.980 --> 2:36:53.220]  but only 20 or so maybe more in in british news
[2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:57.300]  and Bloomberg reported on here but that was it in the u.s that i know of
[2:36:57.300 --> 2:37:02.340]  where they arrested the polish doctors and nurses they've charged them with
[2:37:02.340 --> 2:37:06.340]  taking money from a unnamed pharmacological company
[2:37:06.340 --> 2:37:11.220]  to tell the homeless people that it was a regular flu shot and then it killed
[2:37:11.220 --> 2:37:13.940]  them and it turned out this happened in other
[2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:18.340]  countries but only poland prosecuted how can
[2:37:18.340 --> 2:37:22.340]  the doctors be prosecuted for giving the shot being paid to do it and lying
[2:37:22.340 --> 2:37:25.940]  but how is the company and and i haven't seen that in the news
[2:37:25.940 --> 2:37:30.260]  how do you know it's norvidus i mean i'm not i'm not doubting you but
[2:37:30.260 --> 2:37:33.780]  enlighten us well we know very well
[2:37:33.780 --> 2:37:38.100]  that information disappears after it's put out
[2:37:38.100 --> 2:37:43.940]  and people begin accessing it um in the very early days of this story
[2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:47.060]  quite some number of months ago and by the way
[2:37:47.060 --> 2:37:50.980]  11 people died immediately and then when the
[2:37:50.980 --> 2:37:55.780]  the rest of the people who became very ill suddenly were taken to the hospital
[2:37:55.780 --> 2:38:01.380]  um at least 21 of them died and this was in a very small population of people
[2:38:01.380 --> 2:38:04.580]  about 300 people so we're talking about a
[2:38:04.580 --> 2:38:08.260]  humongous death rate no you're right it says it one center
[2:38:08.260 --> 2:38:12.740]  350 were given at 21 died at the hospital and 11 others before that
[2:38:12.740 --> 2:38:17.540]  so that's 32 that's right that's that's a huge death
[2:38:17.540 --> 2:38:20.180]  rate and we don't know how many other people died
[2:38:20.180 --> 2:38:23.780]  longer term well in the very early days of this
[2:38:23.780 --> 2:38:26.900]  story uh it was made clear that it was the
[2:38:26.900 --> 2:38:31.700]  Novartis vaccine the very same Novartis vaccine by the way that the United
[2:38:31.700 --> 2:38:36.420]  States was stockpiling um and so once that
[2:38:36.420 --> 2:38:40.580]  information began to be circulated widely
[2:38:40.580 --> 2:38:45.140]  the name of the company disappeared let me ask you this then
[2:38:45.140 --> 2:38:48.900]  if Bayer pharmaceutical with over a million ampoules of factor eight
[2:38:48.900 --> 2:38:51.620]  convicted in court france indicted the officials
[2:38:51.620 --> 2:38:54.340]  nobody else did in australia the u.s and other countries
[2:38:54.340 --> 2:38:58.340]  it came out in court msnbc's even reported as you know of the audience
[2:38:58.340 --> 2:39:02.420]  that they knowingly put aids hiv and hepatitis senate
[2:39:02.420 --> 2:39:07.140]  they didn't just let it go out over a decade if you or i got caught
[2:39:07.140 --> 2:39:10.900]  giving a million people hiv or hepatitis we go to the electric chair
[2:39:10.900 --> 2:39:14.580]  or lethal injection when they do it they get
[2:39:14.580 --> 2:39:17.780]  government contracts and are called our saviors
[2:39:17.780 --> 2:39:20.980]  doctor i want your comment on how they get away with this and then i want
[2:39:20.980 --> 2:39:25.060]  general stubblebind's breakdown on the overall master plan what we're facing
[2:39:25.060 --> 2:39:29.780]  here the my comment is that the way they do it
[2:39:29.780 --> 2:39:34.020]  is by the deepest most extraordinarily level
[2:39:34.020 --> 2:39:37.540]  enormous level of corruption we like to think of
[2:39:37.540 --> 2:39:41.860]  other countries around the world is corrupt we like to point our fingers at
[2:39:41.860 --> 2:39:46.100]  countries like thailand and indonesia and say
[2:39:46.100 --> 2:39:50.020]  and african countries and say look how corrupt they are
[2:39:50.020 --> 2:39:53.620]  not realizing that the most profound corruption
[2:39:53.620 --> 2:39:57.140]  is around the pharmaceutical and food industries
[2:39:57.140 --> 2:40:01.620]  which are being used in these
[2:40:01.620 --> 2:40:08.100]  incredibly um inhuman ways coldly and calculatingly
[2:40:08.100 --> 2:40:13.060]  to make a sale and to kill us we know by the way tomorrow
[2:40:13.060 --> 2:40:17.300]  thursday the natural solutions foundation
[2:40:17.300 --> 2:40:24.180]  stop the shot lawsuit will be heard in washington dc we are suing
[2:40:24.180 --> 2:40:31.060]  the fda to prevent them from releasing anymore of their untested unsafe
[2:40:31.060 --> 2:40:38.260]  uninsurable unnecessary h1n1 vaccine and what we have is a world
[2:40:38.260 --> 2:40:44.660]  wide uh amassment of data about how dangerous these vaccines are
[2:40:44.660 --> 2:40:50.660]  from uh from the uh uh people who are dropping dead the people in
[2:40:50.660 --> 2:40:55.460]  germany who are um uh collapsing and dying from the
[2:40:55.460 --> 2:41:00.260]  pandemics uh uh shots and pandemics is one of the uh
[2:41:00.260 --> 2:41:03.860]  the vaccines that the fda has illegally approved
[2:41:03.860 --> 2:41:07.140]  i thought i would take a moment alex to read you
[2:41:07.140 --> 2:41:12.260]  what glauco smith climb admits to the side effects
[2:41:12.260 --> 2:41:16.020]  being and the numbers of the side effects that they anticipate
[2:41:16.020 --> 2:41:22.420]  in their wailing adjuvanted h1n1 vaccine which was just approved
[2:41:22.420 --> 2:41:27.700]  illegally by the united states absolutely i want to do that and i
[2:41:27.700 --> 2:41:32.500]  also want to point out that the mainstream media in public
[2:41:32.500 --> 2:41:36.020]  schools and colleges and in government facilities
[2:41:36.020 --> 2:41:41.300]  is handing out a federally written fact sheet that says there is no mercury
[2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:43.780]  poll watch has written an article about this linking to it
[2:41:43.780 --> 2:41:47.140]  at prisonplanet.com there is no mercury it cannot cause neurological
[2:41:47.140 --> 2:41:50.340]  disorders it cannot cause gillian beret it cannot
[2:41:50.340 --> 2:41:54.580]  cause autoimmune disorders it cannot cause infertility
[2:41:54.580 --> 2:41:59.700]  when the inserts admit this because i want to go over the inserts with both
[2:41:59.700 --> 2:42:02.660]  of you and then get into their master operation
[2:42:02.660 --> 2:42:06.420]  why they're doing this why they believe this and then how to stop them
[2:42:06.420 --> 2:42:12.580]  but how do they just lie and say there's no mercury when it's on all the inserts
[2:42:12.580 --> 2:42:15.700]  i mean it's like they're trying to discredit themselves or do they have
[2:42:15.700 --> 2:42:18.740]  just complete disdain for the public i guess
[2:42:18.740 --> 2:42:22.980]  if they're going to try to ban people getting even medium levels of vitamin
[2:42:22.980 --> 2:42:27.540]  c and vitamin d i guess you know they say vitamins are bad but mercury is good
[2:42:27.540 --> 2:42:31.060]  i mean it's like i've woken up in alice in wonderland
[2:42:31.060 --> 2:42:36.900]  exactly alex there was a story in uh... in all the media a couple of days ago
[2:42:36.900 --> 2:42:40.500]  saying the women who got mercury in their vaccines
[2:42:40.500 --> 2:42:44.180]  while they were pregnant had healthier babies
[2:42:44.180 --> 2:42:50.580]  had larger babies and i thought my god alice in wonderland has nothing on this
[2:42:50.580 --> 2:42:55.060]  this is callous uh... surely uh...
[2:42:55.060 --> 2:42:58.820]  a wicked uh... wickedly laughing
[2:42:58.820 --> 2:43:02.660]  liars i mean i can't think of anything else because these people know
[2:43:02.660 --> 2:43:05.620]  they know perfectly well that mercury
[2:43:05.620 --> 2:43:09.300]  is extraordinarily dangerous for the fetus
[2:43:09.300 --> 2:43:13.060]  and crosses the placenta doctor they're now
[2:43:13.060 --> 2:43:17.620]  i can go to whole foods or i can go to other vitamin shops in austin
[2:43:17.620 --> 2:43:21.380]  and many of the products have mercury in them now i mean we're now entering a
[2:43:21.380 --> 2:43:26.580]  vortex of insanity i want to ask you a good way to put it
[2:43:26.580 --> 2:43:30.740]  let me let me read to you what black so smith client
[2:43:30.740 --> 2:43:36.180]  says on its package insert about the uh... our pan rick
[2:43:36.180 --> 2:43:42.020]  which is the same as the uh... pandemics which has now been banned in
[2:43:42.020 --> 2:43:46.820]  switzerland by the way or children pregnant women
[2:43:46.820 --> 2:43:51.940]  and the chronically ill the very same people that it is approved for without
[2:43:51.940 --> 2:43:54.180]  any testing of course in the united states
[2:43:54.180 --> 2:43:59.940]  let me stop you again that is key they are targeting and pushing the vaccine
[2:43:59.940 --> 2:44:03.300]  on the very people that their own inserts admit
[2:44:03.300 --> 2:44:07.460]  shouldn't take it now i mean that is crime go ahead
[2:44:07.460 --> 2:44:12.180]  and understand that the high levels of swelling even the vaccines that do not
[2:44:12.180 --> 2:44:16.020]  have swelling will be administered unless our suit
[2:44:16.020 --> 2:44:19.780]  succeeds tomorrow will be administered
[2:44:19.780 --> 2:44:25.300]  with admixt swelling they're going to drop swelling that they bought a half
[2:44:25.300 --> 2:44:28.660]  a billion dollars worth of and of course it's
[2:44:28.660 --> 2:44:33.300]  an unapproved very very wait a minute wait a minute that's the bait and switch
[2:44:33.300 --> 2:44:36.740]  it so you're saying they draw up the vaccine and then go to a bottle of
[2:44:36.740 --> 2:44:41.940]  squalene with it yes sir oh my that happens to violate the
[2:44:41.940 --> 2:44:46.980]  uh... the fda's own good manufacturing practices that in itself just that
[2:44:46.980 --> 2:44:50.340]  little uh... trick that we're talking about right now
[2:44:50.340 --> 2:44:55.380]  is illegal in the end unbelievable unbelievable okay go over
[2:44:55.380 --> 2:44:59.780]  go over what their own insert says their own insert say
[2:44:59.780 --> 2:45:04.500]  that in one person in a thousand you will have
[2:45:04.500 --> 2:45:08.820]  allergic reactions leading i'm reading from their own insert
[2:45:08.820 --> 2:45:12.660]  allergic reactions leading to a dangerous decrease of blood pressure
[2:45:12.660 --> 2:45:16.740]  which if untreated may lead to shock that's one in a thousand
[2:45:16.740 --> 2:45:21.300]  doctors are aware of this possibility and have emergency treatment available
[2:45:21.300 --> 2:45:24.420]  for use in such cases except for the fact
[2:45:24.420 --> 2:45:30.500]  that the people who can now administer it under emergency regulations are
[2:45:30.500 --> 2:45:34.980]  pharmacists and cab drivers and just about anybody
[2:45:34.980 --> 2:45:39.300]  who don't have these things available they say that you can have convulsions
[2:45:39.300 --> 2:45:42.980]  severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves
[2:45:42.980 --> 2:45:47.140]  low bloodlet platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising in a
[2:45:47.140 --> 2:45:52.100]  population of three hundred million people according to their
[2:45:52.100 --> 2:45:56.100]  own calculations and we know of course that they're under
[2:45:56.100 --> 2:45:59.140]  estimating the the dangers we're talking about
[2:45:59.140 --> 2:46:02.900]  thirty thousand people to whom this is likely to happen
[2:46:02.900 --> 2:46:07.620]  now very rare they say one in ten thousand but it's not rare we're learning
[2:46:07.620 --> 2:46:10.660]  about in every case the kids being forcibly
[2:46:10.660 --> 2:46:14.900]  inoculated because they're collapsing and having convulsions and having the
[2:46:14.900 --> 2:46:19.380]  blood pressure problem this is devastating there is
[2:46:19.380 --> 2:46:25.460]  in epidemiology if something happens in one in a thousand people it's not
[2:46:25.460 --> 2:46:29.700]  called rare it's called common it's called an epidemic
[2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:32.900]  they have changed the meaning of the word rare
[2:46:32.900 --> 2:46:36.260]  just as one of the casualties along the way
[2:46:36.260 --> 2:46:40.900]  very rare which they say is in one in ten thousand people and again that's not
[2:46:40.900 --> 2:46:45.700]  very rare in a large population vasculitis which means inflammation
[2:46:45.700 --> 2:46:49.380]  of the blood vessels which can cause skin rashes joint pains
[2:46:49.380 --> 2:46:53.940]  and kidney problems and lead to death neurological disorders such as
[2:46:53.940 --> 2:46:59.540]  encephalomyelitis which is essentially meningitis
[2:46:59.540 --> 2:47:04.100]  neuritis and inflammation of the nerve and a type of paralysis known as
[2:47:04.100 --> 2:47:08.660]  eon baray right now this they say is in one in ten
[2:47:08.660 --> 2:47:11.940]  thousand people in fact it will be much more common
[2:47:11.940 --> 2:47:19.060]  so we have nurses and EMTs and teachers pulling up
[2:47:19.060 --> 2:47:26.580]  squailing and injecting it along with the other vaccines at 90 000
[2:47:26.580 --> 2:47:30.820]  injection sites around the united let me stop you again
[2:47:30.820 --> 2:47:34.340]  you're a medical doctor and an expert on this but i've had all these other
[2:47:34.340 --> 2:47:37.780]  medical doctors on playlock top brain scientists
[2:47:37.780 --> 2:47:43.860]  many others they say clearly that in the army studies in the 90s and in 2002
[2:47:43.860 --> 2:47:46.820]  they had to suspend the anthrax shots and others
[2:47:46.820 --> 2:47:50.900]  they proved that the squalene was causing the brain swelling
[2:47:50.900 --> 2:47:55.300]  the heart attacks the inflammation so they know
[2:47:55.300 --> 2:47:58.740]  that by illegally putting squalene into this this is
[2:47:58.740 --> 2:48:01.780]  why why shouldn't the nurses just inject the little kids with
[2:48:01.780 --> 2:48:06.180]  cyanide well they said it was called the fore syndrome
[2:48:06.180 --> 2:48:10.340]  now it should be called the baleia syndrome but it's a little bit worse
[2:48:10.340 --> 2:48:14.180]  the the dose first of all the injection of even
[2:48:14.180 --> 2:48:18.180]  one or two molecules of squalene can cause these problems
[2:48:18.180 --> 2:48:22.100]  so let's be very clear that there is no safe dose of injected
[2:48:22.100 --> 2:48:25.460]  squalene now the dose that they are putting in
[2:48:25.460 --> 2:48:31.780]  and remember the the cdc purchased a half a billion
[2:48:31.780 --> 2:48:36.260]  dollars worth of injectable squalene and they've got uneducated people
[2:48:36.260 --> 2:48:39.780]  injecting people and it's illegal it's an illegal
[2:48:39.780 --> 2:48:43.860]  unapproved drug so that's why obama declared the emergency
[2:48:43.860 --> 2:48:47.460]  so he could give the illegal drug well actually
[2:48:47.460 --> 2:48:51.540]  when he declared the emergency they already had
[2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:55.620]  the emergency youth authorization to give the illegal drug that they'd given
[2:48:55.620 --> 2:48:59.860]  themselves permission for the emergency is even worse than that
[2:48:59.860 --> 2:49:05.540]  the emergency hands control of essentially the country over to
[2:49:05.540 --> 2:49:10.500]  Kathleen Sibelius who can then at her discretion
[2:49:10.500 --> 2:49:15.140]  declare martial law she can call a lockdown
[2:49:15.140 --> 2:49:20.100]  and she doesn't need anybody else involved so he handed to a
[2:49:20.100 --> 2:49:26.020]  non-elected appointed official he handed the control of this country's
[2:49:26.020 --> 2:49:31.060]  future with that devastatingly insane
[2:49:31.060 --> 2:49:35.540]  health emergency of october 23rd but back to the squalene
[2:49:35.540 --> 2:49:39.220]  which they already have given themselves the right to inject under
[2:49:39.220 --> 2:49:42.900]  emergency youth authorization and by the way that's part of what we're
[2:49:42.900 --> 2:49:48.100]  suing to stop tomorrow if you care about this
[2:49:48.100 --> 2:49:53.540]  i would suggest strongly that you go to healthfreedomusa.org
[2:49:53.540 --> 2:49:58.500]  and make as big a donation as you can a recurring donation would be nice
[2:49:58.500 --> 2:50:02.340]  and let it end in the number six so that we know that it's
[2:50:02.340 --> 2:50:06.020]  earmarked for the legal funds because if we prevail
[2:50:06.020 --> 2:50:09.780]  the FDA is going to appeal if we don't prevail
[2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:13.700]  we're going to appeal and federal appeals are very
[2:50:13.700 --> 2:50:18.100]  expensive so amazing now now we've got a break but but i want to get general
[2:50:18.100 --> 2:50:22.500]  stubblebind's response and i know you're going over
[2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:26.740]  the government's own paperwork that comes with the vaccine what they're
[2:50:26.740 --> 2:50:31.940]  admitting it does to people but it looks to me like this program
[2:50:31.940 --> 2:50:36.420]  isn't going well for them and we know that it's clearly
[2:50:36.420 --> 2:50:39.940]  martial law that's been declared through the civil
[2:50:39.940 --> 2:50:43.620]  emergency the problem is can they implement it's one thing to declare
[2:50:43.620 --> 2:50:46.660]  something it's another thing to implement it
[2:50:46.660 --> 2:50:50.580]  and we'll get general stubblebind's break down on that with dr rima lebo as
[2:50:50.580 --> 2:50:54.660]  well i'm alex jones this is the gcn radio network we're also

[2:52:13.700 --> 2:52:16.900]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[2:52:16.900 --> 2:52:21.300]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[2:52:21.300 --> 2:52:25.540]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay
[2:52:25.540 --> 2:52:28.180]  attention for the republic identifies the
[2:52:28.180 --> 2:52:31.620]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:48.260]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[2:53:11.380 --> 2:53:14.180]  too much you should only store what you usually eat

[2:53:50.660 --> 2:53:53.060]  now are equally great visit the website at

[2:54:06.660 --> 2:54:10.820]  according to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny Dr. Blalock and countless other medical
[2:54:10.820 --> 2:54:16.020]  doctors who we've had on and the medical research
[2:54:16.020 --> 2:54:20.580]  the army knows the government knows that more dangerous than the mercury which
[2:54:20.580 --> 2:54:24.580]  acts as an adjuvant is squalene it is the worst
[2:54:24.580 --> 2:54:28.820]  and it killed a lot of us troops it maimed hundreds of thousands and this is
[2:54:28.820 --> 2:54:33.300]  now even come out in congress so when the cdc and the world health
[2:54:33.300 --> 2:54:38.340]  organization is in control of this orders that the european vaccines have
[2:54:38.340 --> 2:54:41.860]  high levels of squalene and that squalene be mixed here because they
[2:54:41.860 --> 2:54:45.140]  couldn't legally have it put in here so they add it later
[2:54:45.140 --> 2:54:48.340]  because they know they're dealing with a stupid not stupid but uninformed nurse
[2:54:48.340 --> 2:54:51.780]  or doctor this is so diabolical i want to go
[2:54:51.780 --> 2:54:54.900]  back to general stubblebond and then back to dr labo there's so much i want to
[2:54:54.900 --> 2:54:59.060]  cover here today general bottom line we talk
[2:54:59.060 --> 2:55:02.100]  about eugenics we talk about population reduction we have the un
[2:55:02.100 --> 2:55:06.020]  documents we have their own statements is there any doubt in
[2:55:06.020 --> 2:55:09.300]  your mind that this is part of a depopulation program that they're just
[2:55:09.300 --> 2:55:13.380]  setting the precedent now for fort's inoculation testing
[2:55:13.380 --> 2:55:17.220]  how serious the soft kill weapons they put in the vaccines food and water
[2:55:17.220 --> 2:55:21.460]  can be and putting binary weapons into us is some documents show
[2:55:21.460 --> 2:55:25.300]  so later they can introduce a new pathogen and
[2:55:25.300 --> 2:55:29.060]  wipe control groups out because everything we see the architecture being
[2:55:29.060 --> 2:55:32.420]  built is a kill system and then of course
[2:55:32.420 --> 2:55:35.620]  six months ago we received a key piece of the puzzle
[2:55:35.620 --> 2:55:39.700]  eco science written by john p holger and the white house science are that says
[2:55:39.700 --> 2:55:42.820]  we're going to put poison in your water sterilize you we're going to put stuff in
[2:55:42.820 --> 2:55:46.180]  your vaccines to sterilize you and we have all these other un documents
[2:55:46.180 --> 2:55:50.420]  saying the same thing i mean we have them doing it but it's so diabolical the
[2:55:50.420 --> 2:55:55.380]  average person just can't believe it's actually happening general stubble bind
[2:55:55.380 --> 2:55:59.780]  well just think about it for a few minutes i keep going back to the
[2:55:59.780 --> 2:56:03.940]  principles of war because it lays it all out very simply
[2:56:03.940 --> 2:56:08.100]  one of the principles is called surprise one of the another one is called
[2:56:08.100 --> 2:56:12.180]  simplicity so think about this i announced that
[2:56:12.180 --> 2:56:17.380]  there's going to be swine flu so i surprised everybody
[2:56:17.380 --> 2:56:20.740]  with the fact that they've got swine swine flu coming
[2:56:20.740 --> 2:56:24.900]  so everybody very simply walks in and says
[2:56:24.900 --> 2:56:28.180]  vaccinate me now because i don't want swine flu
[2:56:28.180 --> 2:56:31.460]  so now what do they put into the swine flu vaccine
[2:56:31.460 --> 2:56:36.660]  stuff that will make you very very infertile if not dead
[2:56:36.660 --> 2:56:40.100]  now think about this who are they giving it to
[2:56:40.100 --> 2:56:44.580]  children pregnant women and the chronically ill
[2:56:44.580 --> 2:56:47.620]  what happens to a child if he's now infertile
[2:56:47.620 --> 2:56:51.620]  he never has a family what happens to a pregnant woman now
[2:56:51.620 --> 2:56:55.700]  she doesn't have any more children so where do you go
[2:56:55.700 --> 2:56:59.780]  suddenly the population stops and what have you got
[2:56:59.780 --> 2:57:05.860]  you have got genocide period i want to go back to the to the squalene
[2:57:05.860 --> 2:57:10.420]  the a few molecules of squalene will make you very very sick
[2:57:10.420 --> 2:57:14.500]  the amount of squalene that they're putting into
[2:57:14.500 --> 2:57:19.940]  human beings and two of the the vaccines that the united states has
[2:57:19.940 --> 2:57:24.340]  illegally approved and that we hope to stop tomorrow in our law
[2:57:24.340 --> 2:57:29.380]  suit in our hearing in washington two of those vaccines are already
[2:57:29.380 --> 2:57:32.740]  squalene adjuvanted one by novartis and one by
[2:57:32.740 --> 2:57:36.420]  glaxosmith client but then they will add the
[2:57:36.420 --> 2:57:41.060]  squalene at the ninety thousand uh... injection location
[2:57:41.060 --> 2:57:45.220]  for the rest of the vaccine and it's at the level
[2:57:45.220 --> 2:57:50.820]  one million times more than that which was put into the vaccine a
[2:57:50.820 --> 2:57:57.060]  which in the presence of pig derived proteins with sugar on them glycoproteins
[2:57:57.060 --> 2:58:02.340]  and human derived glycoproteins will cause immune mediated
[2:58:02.340 --> 2:58:08.260]  sterility according to two patents filed in 1998 so
[2:58:08.260 --> 2:58:12.500]  if you're not already dead if it doesn't kill you right off the bat
[2:58:12.500 --> 2:58:17.220]  it will make you sterile which is why these vaccines are being aimed at
[2:58:17.220 --> 2:58:20.980]  children so the next generation will never be born
[2:58:20.980 --> 2:58:25.220]  and that's fertile women who are already proof oh my god
[2:58:25.220 --> 2:58:29.860]  oh my god i i i want the magnitude of this to sink in because on the inserts
[2:58:29.860 --> 2:58:33.220]  it admits these vaccines are associated with
[2:58:33.220 --> 2:58:36.980]  infertility and sterility and as you said they're
[2:58:36.980 --> 2:58:43.220]  aiming them right at the children and women unbelievable
[2:58:43.220 --> 2:58:52.180]  thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com today
[2:58:52.180 --> 2:58:56.180]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[2:58:56.180 --> 2:59:00.420]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[2:59:00.420 --> 2:59:03.380]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:59:03.380 --> 2:59:06.580]  americans at home have turned a tremendous influence
[2:59:06.580 --> 2:59:10.980]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[2:59:10.980 --> 2:59:15.220]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay
[2:59:15.220 --> 2:59:17.860]  attention for the republic identifies the
[2:59:17.860 --> 2:59:21.300]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[2:59:21.300 --> 2:59:25.460]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[2:59:25.460 --> 2:59:28.260]  government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists
[2:59:28.260 --> 2:59:31.620]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[2:59:31.620 --> 2:59:34.420]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[2:59:34.420 --> 2:59:37.940]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[2:59:37.940 --> 2:59:41.700]  a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic
[2:59:41.700 --> 2:59:47.140]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high
[2:59:47.140 --> 2:59:51.460]  quality at prisonplanet.tv
[2:59:51.460 --> 3:00:01.060]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:08.020 --> 3:00:11.460]  we're gonna talk about a host of issues in this final hour with major general
[3:00:11.460 --> 3:00:15.220]  albert stubblevine and his wife medical doctor rama labo
[3:00:15.220 --> 3:00:19.140]  your phone calls are coming up at the 20 after we'll go ahead and line up but
[3:00:19.140 --> 3:00:22.820]  call i'm going to clear the call board calls only
[3:00:22.820 --> 3:00:27.300]  for general stubblevine and dr labo period but it's a wide area to discuss
[3:00:27.300 --> 3:00:30.340]  but we're going to spend our time the valuable time we have with them
[3:00:30.340 --> 3:00:34.100]  on this subject we're going to talk about solutions in the next segment
[3:00:34.100 --> 3:00:38.020]  we're going to talk about uh coantel pro attacking myself
[3:00:38.020 --> 3:00:42.180]  dr labo general stubblevine and anybody else that's effective
[3:00:42.180 --> 3:00:45.460]  so we're going to discuss that that's the badge of honor and you're over the
[3:00:45.460 --> 3:00:50.180]  target you're getting the flag and the establishment admits the people are
[3:00:50.180 --> 3:00:52.340]  hurting them i think they've overreached with this
[3:00:52.340 --> 3:00:57.620]  operation but dr labo and general stubblevine
[3:00:57.620 --> 3:01:02.420]  they are aiming these at women and children and and people that are fertile
[3:01:02.420 --> 3:01:05.940]  just as the un as you know you can give people the name of the hormone
[3:01:05.940 --> 3:01:09.220]  we're caught adding a synthetic hormone to tetanus shots
[3:01:09.220 --> 3:01:13.620]  to sterilize women and that's the stated un goal i mean they admit
[3:01:13.620 --> 3:01:17.220]  they're doing it to us in their own government policy books
[3:01:17.220 --> 3:01:20.900]  we better listen to them so speak to that and the numbers on cancer
[3:01:20.900 --> 3:01:24.980]  the numbers on diabetes the numbers on autism i mean they are
[3:01:24.980 --> 3:01:30.260]  killing us and they're incrementally turning up the ambient background on
[3:01:30.260 --> 3:01:33.220]  the soft kill and then institutionalizing all
[3:01:33.220 --> 3:01:37.060]  of our deaths and disease and just standardizing it where
[3:01:37.060 --> 3:01:40.420]  everybody gets cancer every year everybody has diabetes
[3:01:40.420 --> 3:01:44.820]  everybody's infertile you know 87 percent men's sperm count down
[3:01:44.820 --> 3:01:49.140]  infertility and women's skyrocketing real fast buzz through the numbers for
[3:01:49.140 --> 3:01:55.220]  folks dr labo the world health organization says in their public
[3:01:55.220 --> 3:01:59.540]  writings that they want to reduce the population by 90
[3:01:59.540 --> 3:02:06.420]  90 percent and they have been using infertility
[3:02:06.420 --> 3:02:14.580]  vaccines since 1974 in 1985 they said in a public document
[3:02:14.580 --> 3:02:17.780]  that they were using these infertility vaccines
[3:02:17.780 --> 3:02:22.020]  disguised as smallpox vaccines and by the way the hormone is not a
[3:02:22.020 --> 3:02:25.060]  synthetic hormone it's a natural hormone called human
[3:02:25.060 --> 3:02:29.620]  chorionic gonadotrophin hdg which they introduced into the vaccine
[3:02:29.620 --> 3:02:32.980]  and then women make antibodies to their own hormones
[3:02:32.980 --> 3:02:36.820]  so they can never again carry a baby okay doctor my
[3:02:36.820 --> 3:02:39.700]  my point was in the medical articles i read and you can correct me this was
[3:02:39.700 --> 3:02:43.700]  years ago they pointed out that it had to be done by design because it had been
[3:02:43.700 --> 3:02:46.820]  simulated a natural hormone i under i understand it's a natural
[3:02:46.820 --> 3:02:50.740]  hormone but is that incorrect that they artificially made it
[3:02:50.740 --> 3:02:54.500]  well they artificially introduced it at the time that they began this they
[3:02:54.500 --> 3:02:56.740]  didn't have the technology to clone it
[3:02:56.740 --> 3:02:59.460]  maybe they do now but the point is that it that it's
[3:02:59.460 --> 3:03:04.660]  molecularly identical to the natural hormone and then women make
[3:03:04.660 --> 3:03:10.180]  antibodies to it so their body attacks their own pregnancies forever
[3:03:10.180 --> 3:03:13.460]  uh... that's one way of creating an immune
[3:03:13.460 --> 3:03:16.420]  uh... reaction another way is by putting in
[3:03:16.420 --> 3:03:20.900]  swelling which in the presence of proteins with sugar on them and
[3:03:20.900 --> 3:03:26.820]  and bio receptors and many many many hormones and so on are glycoproteins
[3:03:26.820 --> 3:03:29.940]  in the presence of the glycoproteins the immune system
[3:03:29.940 --> 3:03:36.020]  turns on the fertility uh... system and attacks it and they will never again
[3:03:36.020 --> 3:03:39.380]  be a pregnancy or there will never be
[3:03:39.380 --> 3:03:43.860]  through a fertility if the person who received this high
[3:03:43.860 --> 3:03:48.420]  swelling dose is a child we're talking about
[3:03:48.420 --> 3:03:53.940]  ending but the next generation uh... i will also want to remind
[3:03:53.940 --> 3:03:58.580]  listeners that we now know as of today
[3:03:58.580 --> 3:04:03.300]  that two scientists one of them named robert webster and the other richard
[3:04:03.300 --> 3:04:07.700]  weddie are listed as patent holders for u.s patent application
[3:04:07.700 --> 3:04:12.340]  two zero zero nine zero zero one oh nine
[3:04:12.340 --> 3:04:16.500]  six two were genetically engineered swine flu
[3:04:16.500 --> 3:04:20.260]  in influenza virus and uses their own
[3:04:20.260 --> 3:04:24.340]  richard web robert webster and richard weddie
[3:04:24.340 --> 3:04:27.700]  are employed by the world health organization
[3:04:27.700 --> 3:04:32.660]  at their influenza laboratory now if that doesn't say the whole thing
[3:04:32.660 --> 3:04:36.900]  then i don't know what does so we have squalling for infertility
[3:04:36.900 --> 3:04:42.580]  we have squalling for profound uh... autoimmune disorders
[3:04:42.580 --> 3:04:46.820]  we have the swine flu that will kill large numbers of people
[3:04:46.820 --> 3:04:52.500]  through the vaccination and we have the pandemic
[3:04:52.500 --> 3:04:57.300]  um international health regulations which allow them
[3:04:57.300 --> 3:05:00.900]  uh... stay there we got to come back we'll continue along that line with our
[3:05:00.900 --> 3:05:04.180]  guest folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about oxy silver the
[3:05:04.180 --> 3:05:08.420]  world's most advanced silver hydrosol that dr horowitz says can make risky
[3:05:08.420 --> 3:05:10.900]  vaccines and antibiotics avoidable you've heard dr lennard
[3:05:10.900 --> 3:05:13.460]  horowitz and others urds vaccination avoidance
[3:05:13.460 --> 3:05:18.260]  instead use vitamin cd and oxy silver along with zeolife for broad spectrum
[3:05:18.260 --> 3:05:21.380]  detoxification using nasa science oxy silver as
[3:05:21.380 --> 3:05:25.940]  nano silver covalently bonded to water oxy silver safely electrocutes
[3:05:25.940 --> 3:05:30.100]  pathogens oxygenates for faster healing then delivers a 528
[3:05:30.100 --> 3:05:34.020]  hertz frequency homeopathic like energy that dr horowitz proves is
[3:05:34.020 --> 3:05:37.780]  fundamental to life in recovering health he also recommends zeolife for blood
[3:05:37.780 --> 3:05:40.980]  cleansing and gi flora pro as a probiotic for intestinal

[3:08:20.180 --> 3:08:23.700]  ninety two thirty one doctor i want you to be able to finish what you were just
[3:08:23.700 --> 3:08:28.420]  getting into the squalene alone and of course a lot of other top scientists
[3:08:28.420 --> 3:08:32.580]  are saying this this virus was clearly manufactured
[3:08:32.580 --> 3:08:36.020]  but addressing general stubble bind for a moment
[3:08:36.020 --> 3:08:41.220]  sir obviously it takes high moral character and strength
[3:08:41.220 --> 3:08:44.340]  to be able to read these government documents where they admit they're
[3:08:44.340 --> 3:08:47.380]  putting poison in our water in the vaccines when they admit they've designed
[3:08:47.380 --> 3:08:51.140]  gmo foods to hurt fertility or sterilize us
[3:08:51.140 --> 3:08:55.060]  to admit that we have this group of eugenicists running things
[3:08:55.060 --> 3:08:57.700]  then a lot of foolish yuppies and people that think they're members of the
[3:08:57.700 --> 3:09:00.980]  establishment will say so what there are too many people
[3:09:00.980 --> 3:09:04.900]  not realizing it's aimed at them as well
[3:09:05.380 --> 3:09:10.580]  i would like you to speak to the nature of the type of mindset that we're
[3:09:10.580 --> 3:09:13.380]  facing with our enemy the character of our enemy
[3:09:13.380 --> 3:09:16.420]  and i'd like you to speak to our military and police who are really starting
[3:09:16.420 --> 3:09:20.180]  to wake up right now about their duty and and if you'd like to
[3:09:20.180 --> 3:09:23.540]  challenge them to look at the evidence to do the research
[3:09:23.540 --> 3:09:26.820]  because i understand this is hard to admit to that even when you have the
[3:09:26.820 --> 3:09:30.980]  documents it's hard to come to grips i mean imagine
[3:09:30.980 --> 3:09:34.180]  being general stubble binder dr lebo or or myself
[3:09:34.180 --> 3:09:37.700]  i mean we're in the spotlight against these people we get attacked by them i
[3:09:37.700 --> 3:09:40.660]  mean i've been attacked at major symposiums by the government they're
[3:09:40.660 --> 3:09:44.820]  writing hit pieces on me every day they have co until pro posing as
[3:09:44.820 --> 3:09:49.940]  patriots attacking us at every level uh but we're doing this because we have to
[3:09:49.940 --> 3:09:53.780]  but but sir can you speak to the nature of the mindset of who we're facing
[3:09:53.780 --> 3:09:57.940]  and then speak to people that are serving the system doctors nurses the
[3:09:57.940 --> 3:10:01.700]  police the military and challenge them to make a
[3:10:01.700 --> 3:10:05.300]  decision which side they're on because you can't be
[3:10:05.300 --> 3:10:09.140]  on the fence on this can you no way
[3:10:09.140 --> 3:10:12.900]  absolutely cannot be on the on the fence first of all
[3:10:12.900 --> 3:10:16.900]  what are the what are the kind of people that would
[3:10:16.900 --> 3:10:20.260]  do something like this the the people who are
[3:10:20.260 --> 3:10:24.180]  involved in in spreading all of this well
[3:10:24.180 --> 3:10:27.780]  first of all they got to be psychopaths i mean nobody
[3:10:27.780 --> 3:10:34.740]  who has any principles at all would do what they're what they're doing to us
[3:10:34.740 --> 3:10:38.340]  let me let me cut in for a minute my training is in psychiatry
[3:10:38.340 --> 3:10:42.820]  and i practice drug-free psychiatry and medicine for many many years alex
[3:10:42.820 --> 3:10:46.340]  a psychopath is the person who has no affiliation
[3:10:46.340 --> 3:10:51.700]  with any other human being no one else matters they appear to look like
[3:10:51.700 --> 3:10:55.700]  connected people but they are in fact totally devoid
[3:10:55.700 --> 3:11:00.260]  of any human sensibility in my view they have given up their humanity
[3:11:00.260 --> 3:11:04.980]  and their psychopathic and doctor i've interviewed other experts on psychopaths
[3:11:04.980 --> 3:11:07.780]  that they also say that they not only don't care
[3:11:07.780 --> 3:11:11.380]  you have a sadistic psychopath that enjoys hurting
[3:11:11.380 --> 3:11:16.580]  particularly innocence women and children they enjoy torturing
[3:11:16.580 --> 3:11:19.780]  absolutely and who are they attacking first
[3:11:19.780 --> 3:11:26.100]  women pregnant women and children the most vulnerable the most valuable
[3:11:26.100 --> 3:11:30.740]  are being attacked first not in twitterland where the same vaccine is
[3:11:30.740 --> 3:11:34.580]  being forbidden to women and pregnant women and
[3:11:34.580 --> 3:11:37.940]  children and the chronically ill because it's too dangerous okay in the
[3:11:37.940 --> 3:11:42.100]  united states the home of the the formally free
[3:11:42.100 --> 3:11:47.780]  and the psychopathic leaders yes and in germany by the way in germany
[3:11:47.780 --> 3:11:53.700]  uh the the uh members of the powerful political
[3:11:53.700 --> 3:11:58.180]  elite and the military have squarely free vaccines
[3:11:58.180 --> 3:12:02.260]  and everybody else gets squarely in vaccines we're by the way doctor i
[3:12:02.260 --> 3:12:05.780]  remember seeing you over a month ago and others
[3:12:05.780 --> 3:12:11.700]  in releases saying that the elites all over the world were getting a clean
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:15.060]  vaccine without squalene enderlucans mercury
[3:12:15.060 --> 3:12:18.820]  aluminum and then now it's even in time magazine that that's the truth
[3:12:18.820 --> 3:12:21.860]  so i want to just confirm that you were right there but going back to general
[3:12:21.860 --> 3:12:25.620]  stubblebine to finish my question so we know who we're dealing with these are
[3:12:25.620 --> 3:12:29.700]  control freaks who enjoy torturing innocence they hate innocence
[3:12:29.700 --> 3:12:33.300]  they hate goodness they revel in death and destruction
[3:12:33.300 --> 3:12:37.780]  but then speaking to people on the fence who've been mentally weak and have not
[3:12:37.780 --> 3:12:41.620]  looked at the research and the facts what do you say to people
[3:12:41.620 --> 3:12:45.140]  who aren't evil but are following orders general
[3:12:45.140 --> 3:12:48.580]  well first of all there are a lot of people who absolutely
[3:12:48.580 --> 3:12:56.740]  uh don't know uh what is the real um a message what is the real purpose
[3:12:56.740 --> 3:13:01.940]  and so these people are in many cases think they're doing a good job oh i'm
[3:13:01.940 --> 3:13:06.820]  sure a lot of the healthcare workers uh believe that they're doing what
[3:13:06.820 --> 3:13:14.100]  they should be should be doing and so now how do you begin to get this set
[3:13:14.100 --> 3:13:20.900]  out of the the grip of the psychopaths and get them working for you
[3:13:20.900 --> 3:13:24.900]  well one of the ways we do this is to make sure that they're
[3:13:24.900 --> 3:13:30.420]  getting the truth we're doing that uh by getting the message out
[3:13:30.420 --> 3:13:37.460]  uh and we're we're getting uh voices uh going that are saying stop
[3:13:37.460 --> 3:13:42.260]  don't do this anymore and i believe that a good part of the break that's been
[3:13:42.260 --> 3:13:48.420]  put on a lot of the uh the uh the genocide right at the moment
[3:13:48.420 --> 3:13:52.420]  has been a direct result of the voices of the people
[3:13:52.420 --> 3:13:59.540]  saying no no no no who are these people they're people who we have
[3:13:59.540 --> 3:14:04.980]  finally begun to wake up as you well know alex these folks operate in secrecy
[3:14:04.980 --> 3:14:08.980]  they're like poison mushrooms they grow in the dank dark shade
[3:14:08.980 --> 3:14:13.300]  and when you shine the light of both information
[3:14:13.300 --> 3:14:17.380]  and reason on them they wither now do they die no
[3:14:17.380 --> 3:14:21.140]  they go away and they come back again through another door
[3:14:21.140 --> 3:14:24.820]  but over and over and over what you're doing and what we're doing
[3:14:24.820 --> 3:14:29.700]  um people like william louis getting the information out there and suing them
[3:14:29.700 --> 3:14:34.740]  suing the bastard has the effect of pushing them back that's right that's
[3:14:34.740 --> 3:14:38.100]  right they are they are bold and run their soft kill
[3:14:38.100 --> 3:14:41.140]  operations on us we have to be bold and have courage and
[3:14:41.140 --> 3:14:44.660]  stand up to them and i want to get into solutions and then phone calls
[3:14:44.660 --> 3:14:48.580]  and some other key areas we haven't gotten into yet but but i wanted to go
[3:14:48.580 --> 3:14:52.900]  back to general stubblebine and dr lebo and and make this point
[3:14:52.900 --> 3:14:57.620]  and i need to do home for one more point uh that i need to make
[3:14:57.620 --> 3:15:01.780]  and that is again back to the principles of war one of the most
[3:15:01.780 --> 3:15:07.940]  important one is mass mass that means the more voices that you've got
[3:15:07.940 --> 3:15:11.940]  the better your chances are that you're going to turn this thing around
[3:15:11.940 --> 3:15:16.180]  that means everybody everybody needs to go to the website
[3:15:16.180 --> 3:15:20.500]  and take the actions that are uh that are stated there
[3:15:20.500 --> 3:15:26.340]  i want to gotta be heard i want to talk that the website is healthfreedomusa.org
[3:15:26.340 --> 3:15:30.820]  i want to talk about the health keepers oath many people know about the oath
[3:15:30.820 --> 3:15:35.860]  keepers the military and the the police and and uh
[3:15:35.860 --> 3:15:40.820]  peacekeepers who are whether retired or active duty saying i will not accept an
[3:15:40.820 --> 3:15:44.980]  illegal order well as of october 23rd when the
[3:15:44.980 --> 3:15:49.620]  health emergency was declared the second stage health emergency by obama
[3:15:49.620 --> 3:15:53.620]  was declared that means that the entire medical
[3:15:53.620 --> 3:15:58.420]  system has been pulled into the vortex and now it is the hospitals that are
[3:15:58.420 --> 3:16:03.540]  going to be used as the staging and the control
[3:16:03.540 --> 3:16:08.340]  system just as the medical system was pulled into the evil in germany
[3:16:08.340 --> 3:16:11.780]  and so i as a health care professional have created
[3:16:11.780 --> 3:16:16.580]  the health keepers oath and i am asking you if you are a health keeper
[3:16:16.580 --> 3:16:22.660]  to go to healthfreedomusa.org and take the health keepers oath and
[3:16:22.660 --> 3:16:25.860]  then share it with your colleagues if you're not a health
[3:16:25.860 --> 3:16:30.500]  keeper you know health keepers you know doctors and nurses and administrators
[3:16:30.500 --> 3:16:35.860]  and janitors and clerks and nurses aides that's right we're having
[3:16:35.860 --> 3:16:41.060]  major victories right now the cfr and others have put out press releases
[3:16:41.060 --> 3:16:44.740]  admitting that they're losing their fight to set up a medical
[3:16:44.740 --> 3:16:48.020]  dictatorship and they're very very angry about it and they've been caught
[3:16:48.020 --> 3:16:51.780]  talking about oh let's say there's a shortage they said this a month ago
[3:16:51.780 --> 3:16:55.780]  of the flu shot to create a panic to get it because nobody wants it
[3:16:55.780 --> 3:16:59.700]  they laugh and giggle they enjoy their psychopathic evil but before we go to
[3:16:59.700 --> 3:17:02.740]  break and come back and take calls and get into more solutions i wanted to
[3:17:02.740 --> 3:17:07.300]  bring this up and i need to do a whole show on this
[3:17:07.300 --> 3:17:12.660]  and present evidence of it and then educate the public but just take the
[3:17:12.660 --> 3:17:17.700]  comments on info wars dot com and take the comments on youtube
[3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:21.540]  and take the other sites the establishment knows they can't attack us
[3:17:21.540 --> 3:17:24.580]  from an establishment position because the
[3:17:24.580 --> 3:17:28.100]  establishment is credited so what they do is they try to get the
[3:17:28.100 --> 3:17:30.740]  alternative media to in fight with each other by having
[3:17:30.740 --> 3:17:34.980]  operatives in there that then try to start to then stir up other
[3:17:34.980 --> 3:17:40.420]  weak-minded people but what we found is we have people working on info wars
[3:17:40.420 --> 3:17:44.980]  that the minute a story goes live and the stories are going live every 20 30
[3:17:44.980 --> 3:17:48.660]  minutes they want to comment first to get the
[3:17:48.660 --> 3:17:52.820]  whole comment changing saying i'm a fed this person's a fed anybody who's
[3:17:52.820 --> 3:17:57.380]  good they say this about they'll tell lies that aren't backed up
[3:17:57.380 --> 3:18:03.380]  and then they will because we can see their ip addresses
[3:18:03.380 --> 3:18:07.220]  they will act like they're the other people agreeing with them to create a
[3:18:07.220 --> 3:18:12.980]  fake consensus and then they will say this site doesn't call for violence
[3:18:12.980 --> 3:18:18.020]  uh this site is bad and wants you to just waste your time
[3:18:18.020 --> 3:18:22.260]  nobody's winning nobody has any power we've lost
[3:18:22.260 --> 3:18:27.140]  we're going to lose and we can then track the ip address and it's being
[3:18:27.140 --> 3:18:30.260]  blocked and it goes to government servers the point at the government amidst
[3:18:30.260 --> 3:18:33.700]  they're doing this the point is they're like tokyo
[3:18:33.700 --> 3:18:38.260]  rose telling us you've lost you have no power you can't win speaking up does
[3:18:38.260 --> 3:18:40.980]  nothing you need to go out and shoot people
[3:18:40.980 --> 3:18:45.780]  and then they flip and the same ip address says we're calling for violence
[3:18:45.780 --> 3:18:50.180]  so so the point is we're not calling for violence we're actually having victories
[3:18:50.180 --> 3:18:54.100]  and building the the history that we have power
[3:18:54.100 --> 3:18:56.980]  showing the people they have power so i wanted to bring this up as general
[3:18:56.980 --> 3:19:01.940]  stubble bind as we go to break what is that tactic of black ops and propaganda
[3:19:01.940 --> 3:19:05.300]  where they keep telling us we're going to lose they keep telling us we have no
[3:19:05.300 --> 3:19:09.700]  hope they keep trying to get us to end fight uh
[3:19:09.700 --> 3:19:13.380]  i mean i mean this is they're clearly doing this
[3:19:13.380 --> 3:19:18.660]  absolutely they're doing it and and uh it's exactly what you call it black
[3:19:18.660 --> 3:19:21.940]  hop up black ops black operations and they're
[3:19:21.940 --> 3:19:27.140]  doing it so that we begin to turn on each other
[3:19:27.140 --> 3:19:32.020]  and get at each other's throat you know the health freedom
[3:19:32.020 --> 3:19:38.740]  movement is riddled with people who simply attack one another and tear
[3:19:38.740 --> 3:19:42.820]  each other's eyes out instead of accomplishing anything
[3:19:42.820 --> 3:19:46.660]  we in fact closed our practice of medicine
[3:19:46.660 --> 3:19:52.340]  drug-free medicine because we saw that we really had no chance to win if these
[3:19:52.340 --> 3:19:55.940]  people continued to dissipate all their energy and so
[3:19:55.940 --> 3:20:00.660]  we decided to take on the health freedom movement stay there stay there got a
[3:20:00.660 --> 3:20:03.700]  break keep say no to government vaccinations say
[3:20:03.700 --> 3:20:08.180]  no to toxic overload say no to chemicals say yes to liquid zeolite

[3:23:04.500 --> 3:23:08.500]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[3:23:08.500 --> 3:23:12.260]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:23:12.260 --> 3:23:15.860]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[3:23:15.860 --> 3:23:20.100]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:23:20.100 --> 3:23:23.300]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[3:23:23.300 --> 3:23:25.940]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:23:25.940 --> 3:23:29.860]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[3:23:29.860 --> 3:23:33.380]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[3:23:33.380 --> 3:23:36.500]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[3:23:36.500 --> 3:23:39.620]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:23:39.620 --> 3:23:43.060]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[3:23:43.060 --> 3:23:46.260]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old

[3:24:20.420 --> 3:24:23.620]  you know i tend to ignore it when i get death threats i tend to ignore it when
[3:24:23.620 --> 3:24:26.100]  national media attacks me and admits i'm a white house
[3:24:26.100 --> 3:24:31.060]  enemies list number 24 but we need to address that and
[3:24:31.060 --> 3:24:34.660]  point out in this opposite free country we're under attack
[3:24:34.660 --> 3:24:39.140]  for reading the vaccine drug inserts on air we're under attack pointing out
[3:24:39.140 --> 3:24:42.900]  local news where the marine corps and army are running checkpoints
[3:24:42.900 --> 3:24:47.780]  tasering citizens that's in the news today
[3:24:47.780 --> 3:24:52.740]  and then when you actually see it's the same IP addresses
[3:24:52.740 --> 3:24:56.740]  trying to get people to be violent or then saying there's no point none of us
[3:24:56.740 --> 3:25:00.260]  can win we have no power trying to sap our will
[3:25:00.260 --> 3:25:05.140]  when we're having victories over 70 percent of the public's refusing it
[3:25:05.140 --> 3:25:08.020]  most the doctors in england won't take it or give it most the doctors in
[3:25:08.020 --> 3:25:10.980]  germany won't take it major publications are admitting it has
[3:25:10.980 --> 3:25:16.420]  cancer viruses and rna in it and i almost think these are death
[3:25:16.420 --> 3:25:19.460]  throws i mean the establishment has the money has the power
[3:25:19.460 --> 3:25:23.300]  they may win but they're certainly not
[3:25:23.300 --> 3:25:26.580]  dominating and we're seeing them by attrition
[3:25:26.580 --> 3:25:32.420]  lose power we're seeing them stall out we're seeing them grinding the mud
[3:25:32.420 --> 3:25:36.660]  and we're having victories but meanwhile you see the government admitting
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:40.340]  they've got tens of thousands of paid bloggers and operatives out there
[3:25:40.340 --> 3:25:43.460]  putting out this info going back to general stubble bind
[3:25:43.460 --> 3:25:46.900]  are you seeing the same thing we're making major inroads and they're really
[3:25:46.900 --> 3:25:50.020]  screaming bloody murder and freaking out right now
[3:25:50.020 --> 3:25:54.020]  first of all we are about attack all of the time just like you
[3:25:54.020 --> 3:26:00.740]  we're attacked by crazies and what we have done so far is absolutely ignore
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:05.300]  them we we don't spend the time giving them
[3:26:05.300 --> 3:26:09.460]  any traction whatsoever they they talk they fuss they
[3:26:09.460 --> 3:26:12.900]  one of my favorite one of my favorite crazy
[3:26:12.900 --> 3:26:17.700]  and says and she's she's quite well known she says that
[3:26:17.700 --> 3:26:21.620]  people shouldn't buy our valley of the moon coffee which is part of our valley
[3:26:21.620 --> 3:26:26.020]  of the moon eco demonstration project they shouldn't buy our valley of the
[3:26:26.020 --> 3:26:29.780]  moon coffee because we've laced it with a mind control drug
[3:26:29.780 --> 3:26:35.780]  and uh... my response is well when bird brings me a cup of coffee in the morning
[3:26:35.780 --> 3:26:39.460]  i acquire a mind with the caffeine in the coffee
[3:26:39.460 --> 3:26:44.500]  but uh... that's how crazy it gets and yet people believe in this stuff
[3:26:44.500 --> 3:26:50.180]  it's like going to a bullfight people don't go to see the matador's costume
[3:26:50.180 --> 3:26:53.380]  they go for the blood and so playing to the lowest
[3:26:53.380 --> 3:26:58.740]  basis instinct the the crazies who are stimulated by
[3:26:58.740 --> 3:27:04.420]  and the uh... the uh... government employees who are directed by
[3:27:04.420 --> 3:27:08.180]  the forces that don't want our pushback
[3:27:08.180 --> 3:27:11.940]  attack you they attack us they attack but that's what i'm saying i mean i
[3:27:11.940 --> 3:27:15.380]  never addressed this but i think i am going to do some programs
[3:27:15.380 --> 3:27:19.700]  or actually show the proof and then show the government documents because that
[3:27:19.700 --> 3:27:24.180]  shows where we're the good guys that that this is happening that they're
[3:27:24.180 --> 3:27:28.740]  coming after us and that we are effective and just illustrating that
[3:27:28.740 --> 3:27:32.740]  they do wait on the articles to get everyone
[3:27:32.740 --> 3:27:37.460]  not discussing protesting or suing like the new york nurses did to stop force
[3:27:37.460 --> 3:27:40.900]  inoculation there i notice anything effective
[3:27:40.900 --> 3:27:44.180]  that will stop them they're there on the comments
[3:27:44.180 --> 3:27:48.340]  to try to turn everything around where the debate isn't about that and then we
[3:27:48.340 --> 3:27:50.340]  check their ip's and they're the government
[3:27:50.340 --> 3:27:55.380]  i mean that is pure evil i can't imagine being a government exactly what
[3:27:55.380 --> 3:27:59.220]  the what uh... uh... black ops is about
[3:27:59.220 --> 3:28:03.460]  you know what exactly what it is you know what we did on our blog
[3:28:03.460 --> 3:28:06.420]  we simply click the button that said no comment
[3:28:06.420 --> 3:28:10.820]  because we don't have time to deal with this nonsense
[3:28:10.820 --> 3:28:14.900]  and there's plenty of opportunity for people to read the negative stuff
[3:28:14.900 --> 3:28:19.140]  we put out the real stuff we put out the pushback that works
[3:28:19.140 --> 3:28:22.820]  and those no i know but i mean i allow the free for all
[3:28:22.820 --> 3:28:26.500]  because i think it's teaching people and folks are actually learning
[3:28:26.500 --> 3:28:29.780]  and i think it's great but we have
[3:28:29.780 --> 3:28:34.340]  um we don't have time to deal with it and it has to be dealt with and we don't
[3:28:34.340 --> 3:28:37.380]  have the manpower to deal with it i don't know man i mean listen the only
[3:28:37.380 --> 3:28:40.980]  reason i brought it up is the government is out there doing this
[3:28:40.980 --> 3:28:49.380]  it's really certainly who's behind the all of the genocide anyway
[3:28:49.380 --> 3:28:54.260]  you know it's not your friends so yes i agree with you of course the government
[3:28:54.260 --> 3:28:58.580]  is out there doing it and we've been viciously attacked just as you have and
[3:28:58.580 --> 3:29:01.220]  some people wander off but they come back
[3:29:01.220 --> 3:29:05.140]  because eventually truth does ring like but that's what i was going to say
[3:29:05.140 --> 3:29:08.820]  i mean the reason i brought this up with you is that people should have common
[3:29:08.820 --> 3:29:11.380]  sense anybody that says we don't have any hope
[3:29:11.380 --> 3:29:15.140]  anybody that says we don't have power anybody that says there's no point in
[3:29:15.140 --> 3:29:18.660]  talking and warning people they just want to divert you off into
[3:29:18.660 --> 3:29:22.340]  arguing with them instead of going and warning people that want to be
[3:29:22.340 --> 3:29:25.860]  awakened and so i i tell people don't defend me
[3:29:25.860 --> 3:29:29.700]  don't answer the distractions go out and warn young girls

[3:29:37.300 --> 3:29:40.820]  warn people don't get caught up in the end fighting
[3:29:40.820 --> 3:29:44.500]  know what it is and just do the good work of warning people
[3:29:44.500 --> 3:29:47.940]  let's come back and take phone calls get more into the vaccines

[3:37:30.020 --> 3:37:35.460]  to reclaim the production of food for farmers and non farmers alike so we'll
[3:37:35.460 --> 3:37:38.420]  be there and we would love to talk to you alec
[3:37:38.420 --> 3:37:42.500]  all right in closing on the co-intel program we're going to calls
[3:37:42.500 --> 3:37:47.700]  to simplify it we have the army field manual declassified in 2004
[3:37:47.700 --> 3:37:52.100]  written for latin america where they say go out and say the local leaders who
[3:37:52.100 --> 3:37:57.060]  were good are really feds where they teach the army
[3:37:57.060 --> 3:37:59.780]  in black ops how to get everybody fighting with each other
[3:37:59.780 --> 3:38:02.820]  and general stubblebine can certainly expose that
[3:38:02.820 --> 3:38:06.820]  we see that anybody who's saying we can stand together we can lead
[3:38:06.820 --> 3:38:11.540]  we can fight the globalist is demonized because the system knows they're
[3:38:11.540 --> 3:38:15.780]  discredited they have to pose as patriots to then in fight
[3:38:15.780 --> 3:38:18.980]  in fighting is the sign of being an operative or one of their mentally ill
[3:38:18.980 --> 3:38:24.260]  stuges and in closing i'll say this it isn't ron paul that's trying to
[3:38:24.260 --> 3:38:27.460]  pass the private federal reserve world government takeover it is an alec
[3:38:27.460 --> 3:38:30.420]  jones is trying to make you take force inoculations
[3:38:30.420 --> 3:38:33.860]  it isn't general stubblebine that's trying to put sodium fluoride in your
[3:38:33.860 --> 3:38:39.700]  water it isn't dr rima labo uh that is federalizing your local police
[3:38:39.700 --> 3:38:43.780]  it's the big corrupt offshore banks and so
[3:38:43.780 --> 3:38:46.900]  why do all these supposed patriot groups and sites
[3:38:46.900 --> 3:38:51.460]  spend all their time attacking whoever is effective
[3:38:51.460 --> 3:38:56.260]  they do that so you'll get sucked off into these end fights and never become
[3:38:56.260 --> 3:39:00.420]  the leaders you were meant to be so i'll say this today
[3:39:00.420 --> 3:39:04.980]  let's just say alex jones is bad i'm pure evil i'm not my fruits are excellent
[3:39:04.980 --> 3:39:08.020]  i'm pure of heart anyone with discernment knows that
[3:39:08.020 --> 3:39:12.980]  14 years of fighting 15 16 17 hours a day but let's just say i'm evil
[3:39:12.980 --> 3:39:16.740]  let's just say general stubblebines bad and he's not a great patriot who's come
[3:39:16.740 --> 3:39:20.260]  over to our side and he was always on our side but woke up and fully went
[3:39:20.260 --> 3:39:23.140]  against the evil let's just say he's bad let's
[3:39:23.140 --> 3:39:27.060]  just say ron paul's bad okay let's get past that excuse
[3:39:27.060 --> 3:39:31.140]  now you go fight the new world order you know it's coming down on you
[3:39:31.140 --> 3:39:36.180]  you know this is real you know you're good and so you go out and be a leader
[3:39:36.180 --> 3:39:39.780]  and when you get attacked then you'll understand
[3:39:39.780 --> 3:39:43.460]  we need to reach everybody now we need to reach out now
[3:39:43.460 --> 3:39:47.620]  we need to understand that whoever's being attacked is who is effective and who
[3:39:47.620 --> 3:39:50.100]  is good now i'm done talking about that
[3:39:50.100 --> 3:39:53.940]  but i i i just have seen particular attacks on our two guests
[3:39:53.940 --> 3:39:57.300]  and i know their work's good i've been watching them for years researching them
[3:39:57.300 --> 3:40:00.900]  for years everything they do is good the fruits
[3:40:00.900 --> 3:40:03.860]  are good that's how you judge a tree but there's
[3:40:03.860 --> 3:40:08.820]  these horrible sick trees with poison on them that always flap their branches and
[3:40:08.820 --> 3:40:13.780]  attack anybody who's good it's time to see through the mind control
[3:40:13.780 --> 3:40:16.500]  uh let's go to tiffany in connecticut you're on the air with our guests go
[3:40:16.500 --> 3:40:20.660]  ahead hi um i'm actually a nurse and i just
[3:40:20.660 --> 3:40:26.100]  wanted to say that i just can't even imagine how many flu shots that i've
[3:40:26.100 --> 3:40:30.340]  given it makes me stressed out when i'm listening to this to think about how
[3:40:30.340 --> 3:40:33.460]  many people because even in nursing school we were required to go out to
[3:40:33.460 --> 3:40:36.900]  grocery stores to nursing homes with places like that and just give flu
[3:40:36.900 --> 3:40:40.740]  shot after flu shot after flu shot after flu shot under the guise of
[3:40:40.740 --> 3:40:45.460]  you know practicing to give i am shot and then once i got a job out of school
[3:40:45.460 --> 3:40:49.540]  um the hospital's got huge huge fines for every patient that left the hospital
[3:40:49.540 --> 3:40:53.460]  without a flu shot so every single person we were required to ask and if they
[3:40:53.460 --> 3:40:56.900]  said they hadn't had the flu shot we were required to give it and see let me
[3:40:56.900 --> 3:41:00.740]  stop you that's a key it's admitted that schools get bonus money
[3:41:00.740 --> 3:41:03.780]  if they forcibly inoculate they get fined if they don't
[3:41:03.780 --> 3:41:06.980]  same thing with hospitals but the general public doesn't know this
[3:41:06.980 --> 3:41:10.660]  so now they're forcibly i mean it's now happened they are now forcibly
[3:41:10.660 --> 3:41:14.100]  injecting kids nationwide and it's a non-issue
[3:41:14.100 --> 3:41:17.060]  except when they collapse and go to the hospital go ahead then i want to get
[3:41:17.060 --> 3:41:21.220]  dr lebo to comment on this okay but um what i was
[3:41:21.220 --> 3:41:24.820]  i was talking to my friend last night i was telling him about everything he had
[3:41:24.820 --> 3:41:29.220]  no idea about anything that you've ever said anything that you've ever done
[3:41:29.220 --> 3:41:32.980]  so i'm talking to him about everything and come to find out he has a nine
[3:41:32.980 --> 3:41:37.060]  month old daughter and then i just kind of randomly spill over and start talking
[3:41:37.060 --> 3:41:41.300]  about the flu shot and you know all the negatives about it and he says
[3:41:41.300 --> 3:41:46.020]  oh my god i just got my daughter the flu shot you know she's nine months old and
[3:41:46.020 --> 3:41:50.740]  i'm like oops and you know and he's like what do i do and i'm like well
[3:41:50.740 --> 3:41:55.060]  oh well one you can stop putting you know tap water in her infamil
[3:41:55.060 --> 3:41:58.820]  but i mean i don't really that's why i was calling because i'm and not only
[3:41:58.820 --> 3:42:01.620]  that i also have a seven-year-old as well i mean
[3:42:01.620 --> 3:42:05.540]  obviously he's gotten most of his shots but it's kind of like especially if
[3:42:05.540 --> 3:42:08.660]  they're going to start doing what you were saying about the
[3:42:08.660 --> 3:42:12.340]  about the like forced malnourishment you know what can we do
[3:42:12.340 --> 3:42:16.340]  like what do i tell him to do and what what should i do when it comes to our
[3:42:16.340 --> 3:42:20.740]  not just politically if somebody's had the the squalene shots of the mercury
[3:42:20.740 --> 3:42:24.180]  and filled shots what can they do to detoxify
[3:42:24.180 --> 3:42:29.060]  dr lebo general stubble bun well unfortunately the shots are very
[3:42:29.060 --> 3:42:32.580]  complicated and if they've had the squalene filled
[3:42:32.580 --> 3:42:37.940]  shots they detoxifying the is very difficult
[3:42:37.940 --> 3:42:41.460]  however the immune system is weakened
[3:42:41.460 --> 3:42:44.740]  by these shots all of them with or without squalene
[3:42:44.740 --> 3:42:48.820]  and so what you need to do is get yourself some nano silver
[3:42:48.820 --> 3:42:54.660]  not colloidal silver nano silver and start taking it on a regular basis
[3:42:54.660 --> 3:42:59.220]  for a baby uh half a teaspoon once a day for a
[3:42:59.220 --> 3:43:06.100]  toddler or a grown-up of a teaspoon once or twice a day and start
[3:43:06.100 --> 3:43:10.260]  rebuilding your immune system it does not kill the beneficial bacteria that are
[3:43:10.260 --> 3:43:14.020]  part of your immune system the second and by the way there's a
[3:43:14.020 --> 3:43:18.340]  hearing going on uh that the epa is holding this week
[3:43:18.340 --> 3:43:22.420]  three-day hearing to take silver off the market one of the things that we're
[3:43:22.420 --> 3:43:27.540]  asking people to do is to take action items on our website
[3:43:27.540 --> 3:43:34.180]  healthfreedomusa.org and overwhelm the the folks who want
[3:43:34.180 --> 3:43:37.460]  to take away your right to make your own health decisions
[3:43:37.460 --> 3:43:41.220]  with the demand that they back off and they will
[3:43:41.220 --> 3:43:49.540]  so take silver take vitamin c take b vitamins and pray
[3:43:49.540 --> 3:43:53.140]  that your immune system doesn't get so assaulted
[3:43:53.140 --> 3:43:57.540]  yeah well it's the repeated injury too isn't it thank you for the call man
[3:43:57.540 --> 3:44:01.220]  any comments to tiffany general stubblebine the other thing is that you
[3:44:01.220 --> 3:44:06.900]  must then never again take any more vaccines ever
[3:44:06.900 --> 3:44:10.660]  or give them or give them
[3:44:11.780 --> 3:44:16.260]  absolutely we're going to take a few more calls i i i forgot one other side
[3:44:16.260 --> 3:44:18.340]  issue i wanted to bring up before we take a few final
[3:44:18.340 --> 3:44:22.820]  calls with general stubblebine and of course dr uh labor
[3:44:22.820 --> 3:44:26.980]  and that is i'm going to ask you about this during a break but i'll just ask
[3:44:26.980 --> 3:44:29.700]  you here live on air general and and if you don't want to get into it that's
[3:44:29.700 --> 3:44:33.700]  fine but i'm interested uh of two years ago
[3:44:33.700 --> 3:44:37.540]  on air i told you that john ronson's men who stare at goats was being made into a
[3:44:37.540 --> 3:44:40.260]  movie you knew about it and said that the book was
[3:44:40.260 --> 3:44:44.100]  absolute baloney now i've seen the trailer for it it's a big
[3:44:44.100 --> 3:44:47.940]  movie with george plunie and everybody else in it
[3:44:47.940 --> 3:44:52.660]  who's the guy that plays obi-wan kanobi in the new star wars
[3:44:52.660 --> 3:44:55.940]  i mean the point is it's got star studded cast in it
[3:44:55.940 --> 3:44:59.700]  and it just makes a big joke out of some of the stuff that was being done at the
[3:44:59.700 --> 3:45:02.260]  pentagon it and it didn't resemble in any way the
[3:45:02.260 --> 3:45:05.780]  trailers i've seen what you said actually went on
[3:45:05.780 --> 3:45:09.540]  uh any comments on that general stubblebine
[3:45:09.540 --> 3:45:15.380]  why would they tell the truth you know the the only thing it's going to sell
[3:45:15.380 --> 3:45:20.820]  is something that people can uh sort of affiliate with and
[3:45:20.820 --> 3:45:24.500]  and uh find that it it gets in there
[3:45:24.500 --> 3:45:28.420]  psychopathic uh belly it's the blood in the bullfight
[3:45:28.420 --> 3:45:32.420]  you got that right so as a matter of fact we
[3:45:32.420 --> 3:45:36.900]  have not even seen the movie we have no desire to haven't read the book because
[3:45:36.900 --> 3:45:40.500]  i have no desire to read it i know what you know i mean you know
[3:45:40.500 --> 3:45:44.580]  doc it's it i mean you're a major they have a major character based on you
[3:45:44.580 --> 3:45:48.580]  so i know i mean it's a big movie
[3:45:48.580 --> 3:45:51.940]  secondarily jesse ventura he he he's told me
[3:45:51.940 --> 3:45:55.060]  he thinks this is more than fair he thinks this new tv show
[3:45:55.060 --> 3:46:00.100]  leans towards our view uh i just can't see how time warner is going to let it on
[3:46:00.100 --> 3:46:02.740]  air but they're promoting it it's coming out in december
[3:46:02.740 --> 3:46:05.780]  you guys flew to the u.s to be interviewed i recommended you be
[3:46:05.780 --> 3:46:09.700]  interviewed for the show uh and uh you know i trust jesse but
[3:46:09.700 --> 3:46:13.460]  will i tell you uh this it's going to be interesting to see what's in this tv
[3:46:13.460 --> 3:46:16.500]  show you know we wouldn't go back to the united
[3:46:16.500 --> 3:46:20.660]  states to be interviewed by him until we had spoken to him personally
[3:46:20.660 --> 3:46:24.180]  and i was convinced that he was a decent man and
[3:46:24.180 --> 3:46:28.740]  was not going to do a hatchet job we flew back to the united states we had
[3:46:28.740 --> 3:46:33.220]  uh an extremely pleasant day with him he's a
[3:46:33.220 --> 3:46:37.780]  truly good person by the way he he's quite open about the fact that he has a
[3:46:37.780 --> 3:46:41.220]  vaccine injured child so he understands about vaccine
[3:46:41.220 --> 3:46:45.620]  and he promised he would not do a hatchet job now the question is what
[3:46:45.620 --> 3:46:49.380]  happens on the cutting room floor beyond his control
[3:46:49.380 --> 3:46:52.900]  and we'll see if a hatchet job does take place
[3:46:52.900 --> 3:46:59.540]  we'll know that time warner was basically used him in a setup
[3:46:59.540 --> 3:47:05.220]  we'll see absolutely and i i know a lot of the inside baseball so
[3:47:05.220 --> 3:47:08.020]  i'll be here to testify to whatever goes on but
[3:47:08.020 --> 3:47:12.020]  uh i think the establishment now though is just admitting so much it's almost
[3:47:12.020 --> 3:47:16.900]  like they're throwing it in our face uh so who knows but but it's called
[3:47:16.900 --> 3:47:20.500]  conspiracy theory and it is uh coming out
[3:47:20.500 --> 3:47:27.060]  december december second uh but uh i was very impressed by jesse
[3:47:27.060 --> 3:47:29.940]  yeah no i mean i've never talked about that on air but i do know that he has a
[3:47:29.940 --> 3:47:34.900]  vaccine damaged child and that's the wake-up call uh for people
[3:47:34.900 --> 3:47:39.860]  that uh this stuff's real and people better get up off their butts into the
[3:47:39.860 --> 3:47:44.020]  research let's talk to todd in georgia todd you're on the air
[3:47:44.020 --> 3:47:49.140]  hey what's up alex um i just i i um i feel like i'm the only person that's
[3:47:49.140 --> 3:47:52.180]  not under this massive noses this this incredibly
[3:47:52.180 --> 3:47:55.620]  strong spell that all the people in my class are in
[3:47:55.620 --> 3:47:58.100]  i'm in school and i'm forced to take american government i'm sitting there
[3:47:58.100 --> 3:48:02.500]  like wow this is all bs but i'm trying to get everybody i'm a
[3:48:02.500 --> 3:48:06.660]  pissed off and determined warrior um and i just want to know if they're going to
[3:48:06.660 --> 3:48:10.820]  do something that's i guess reminiscent of atop hitler times and all that
[3:48:10.820 --> 3:48:16.820]  which i totally believe um yeah but this is more of a scientific dictatorship
[3:48:16.820 --> 3:48:23.380]  um general stubble bind briefly sum up the type of scientific
[3:48:23.380 --> 3:48:27.860]  tyranny that we see unfolding i mean i mean if you had to in front of a group
[3:48:27.860 --> 3:48:32.340]  of generals that you were addressing describe the type of enemy we're facing
[3:48:32.340 --> 3:48:36.100]  in two minutes who are they
[3:48:36.100 --> 3:48:39.540]  well first of all they're obviously the the globalist
[3:48:39.540 --> 3:48:43.540]  there are people who uh believe in genocide
[3:48:43.540 --> 3:48:47.460]  that do not want uh 90 percent of the population
[3:48:47.460 --> 3:48:55.300]  living they want to uh control every all of the resources in the world
[3:48:55.300 --> 3:49:01.300]  and they are found and determined to use multiple
[3:49:01.300 --> 3:49:09.220]  problems multiple systems to eliminate all of the uh useless eaters which is
[3:49:09.220 --> 3:49:13.220]  what they call us uh i don't know whether todd whether you
[3:49:13.220 --> 3:49:17.060]  think you're a useless eater but i know damn well i'm not
[3:49:17.060 --> 3:49:22.980]  and neither is uh dr lebo and uh but they would like all of the useless
[3:49:22.980 --> 3:49:29.540]  eaters to just kind of disappear from the from the world
[3:49:29.540 --> 3:49:36.580]  and if you think that is not uh planned if you think that this is not uh uh
[3:49:36.580 --> 3:49:41.620]  very well thought out and if you think they don't have the resources to do it
[3:49:41.620 --> 3:49:46.100]  you're dreaming absolutely and i've studied their systems of
[3:49:46.100 --> 3:49:50.980]  incrementally beta testing things it's clear that the beta testing is over
[3:49:50.980 --> 3:49:54.420]  and they're go all the horrors before were just beta test
[3:49:54.420 --> 3:49:57.300]  that the 200 million killed by governments funded by this banking
[3:49:57.300 --> 3:50:00.340]  syndicate last century was only a test
[3:50:00.340 --> 3:50:04.980]  we are now seeing the launch of their real operation do you agree with that
[3:50:04.980 --> 3:50:08.740]  uh dr lebo and general stuff absolutely i don't believe
[3:50:08.740 --> 3:50:16.100]  that either the sars incident or the avian flu re-engineered and weaponized
[3:50:16.100 --> 3:50:24.100]  or the swine flu bioengineered uh or the ukrainian uh pneumonic plague uh
[3:50:24.100 --> 3:50:29.860]  episode are were intended to not kill large numbers of people i think they
[3:50:29.860 --> 3:50:33.940]  misfire and these people have had to backfill and correct
[3:50:33.940 --> 3:50:37.780]  and now i think they're getting better and better of what they're doing and in
[3:50:37.780 --> 3:50:44.900]  the absence of a good strong um genocidal viral plague
[3:50:44.900 --> 3:50:48.660]  they are proceeding with their plan as if they had
[3:50:48.660 --> 3:50:52.340]  the the viral kill that they wanted because
[3:50:52.340 --> 3:50:55.460]  the time has come in their demented mind

[3:54:41.300 --> 3:54:46.180]  you had said that uh something about kathleen sablez
[3:54:46.180 --> 3:54:49.780]  uh was going to call off the pandemic what happened
[3:54:49.780 --> 3:54:54.980]  with that i'm sorry i couldn't hear what your question was she said kathleen
[3:54:54.980 --> 3:54:57.620]  sablez was going to do something with the pandemic
[3:54:57.620 --> 3:55:03.940]  oh she did as a matter of fact uh kathleen sablez uh has been approving
[3:55:03.940 --> 3:55:07.460]  vaccines that are illegal that's why we're suing her
[3:55:07.460 --> 3:55:14.260]  uh tomorrow's our first hearing um and she's also been uh releasing
[3:55:14.260 --> 3:55:18.740]  uh squalene under an emergency authorization
[3:55:18.740 --> 3:55:24.500]  use which i'm sorry an emergency use authorization totally illegal and she
[3:55:24.500 --> 3:55:29.140]  has been given control of the country essentially by obama's
[3:55:29.140 --> 3:55:32.900]  uh national health emergency which again is a drill
[3:55:32.900 --> 3:55:36.100]  to train us in the future to go into the control we'll talk more about that
[3:55:36.100 --> 3:55:38.980]  next week thank you kathy thank you so much
[3:55:38.980 --> 3:55:42.180]  and in iowa you're on the air moving quick to get these final callers in go
[3:55:42.180 --> 3:55:45.540]  ahead yeah hey hi thanks for taking my call i'd
[3:55:45.540 --> 3:55:50.260]  like to express extreme gratitude to you all for the hard work you do
[3:55:50.260 --> 3:55:53.940]  um i know we're talking about all these problems and it's pure
[3:55:53.940 --> 3:55:58.820]  evil it makes me shake sometimes but there seems to be a solution to all
[3:55:58.820 --> 3:56:02.820]  the things we're talking about and it's in plain sight and it's funny
[3:56:02.820 --> 3:56:05.860]  that exactly but at least you can recognize evil
[3:56:05.860 --> 3:56:10.420]  what's wrong is people that aren't upset by it it's the same thing that pope
[3:56:10.420 --> 3:56:15.620]  innocent the eighth outlawed when he did his so-called
[3:56:15.620 --> 3:56:19.860]  health care reform too and it's and it's cannabis it seems that
[3:56:19.860 --> 3:56:26.260]  um the cannabinoids the endocannabinoids is nature's way of
[3:56:26.260 --> 3:56:30.100]  controlling the inflammation from let me jump fast then angus i want to go to
[3:56:30.100 --> 3:56:33.380]  paul in closing and say about a general stubble about a dr lebo
[3:56:33.380 --> 3:56:37.860]  but cannabis does it have a lot of good medical attributes
[3:56:37.860 --> 3:56:43.620]  uh it does it also has some uh neurological problems associated with it
[3:56:43.620 --> 3:56:48.580]  uh when it's smoked now one of the reasons it's being so viciously attacked
[3:56:48.580 --> 3:56:52.500]  is that the pharmaceutical industry is in the process of synthesizing and
[3:56:52.500 --> 3:56:57.540]  patenting it so it's bad when people access it on their own even if it's
[3:56:57.540 --> 3:57:00.580]  licensed but it's good when they can sell it to you
[3:57:00.580 --> 3:57:06.100]  all right let's talk to paul in oregon quickly paul we're almost out of time
[3:57:06.100 --> 3:57:09.860]  thanks for having me i just want to make a couple quick comments my

[3:57:24.420 --> 3:57:28.900]  uh he had leg tremors for a week and a half afterwards could not walk could not

[3:57:33.460 --> 3:57:37.300]  um he's in his 80s and i think this is probably going to be the beginning
[3:57:37.300 --> 3:57:41.140]  of a very bad last hey listen local talk show host
