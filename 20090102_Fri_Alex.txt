[01:17.560 --> 01:22.520]  I'm saying that over and over again to get myself mentally prepared for the new
[01:22.520 --> 01:29.860]  year that we have just entered into ladies and gentlemen we have Israel
[01:29.860 --> 01:36.360]  preparing for a massive ground assault into Gaza that area roughly twice the
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.960]  size of the district of criminals in DC masses of tens of thousands of troops
[01:41.960 --> 01:46.680]  and tanks and artillery attack helicopters and fighter bombers have been
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.360]  bombing they're now into day number what seven it'll be day number eight
[01:51.360 --> 01:57.320]  tomorrow we have India and Pakistan still continuing to mass trips along the
[01:57.320 --> 02:02.760]  cashmere border and other disputed regions between the two nuclear powers
[02:02.760 --> 02:09.000]  we have mainstream news world leaders bank chairman all coming out
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.600]  simultaneously saying we're in a depression so they can further destroy
[02:13.600 --> 02:18.040]  confidence and implode the economy so they can consolidate the wealth and then
[02:18.040 --> 02:24.440]  pose as saviors offering their world government and world taxation as the
[02:24.440 --> 02:29.640]  solution what a way to start the new year ladies and gentlemen with all of
[02:29.640 --> 02:36.400]  this unfolding and we have Barack Obama now only 20 days well excuse me 19 days
[02:36.400 --> 02:44.920]  and counting until he is El Presidente and with all of this military buildups
[02:44.920 --> 02:53.200]  and wars and rumors of wars going on and the economy in freefall flatlining with
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.080]  all of the incredibly serious issues taking place the police state unfolding
[02:57.080 --> 03:02.880]  what is the mainstream media focused on today oh my gosh Barack Obama isn't
[03:02.880 --> 03:09.800]  allowed to move in early to one of the executive auxiliary whitehouses and his
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.400]  children are being abused and may not be able to start school at their elite
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.800]  private school I thought you love socialism and government brainwashing
[03:18.800 --> 03:22.320]  camps Obama why don't you put your children in that I mean what a diversion
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.800]  because the media the control corporate press gives you the false left and false
[03:26.800 --> 03:30.160]  right flavors of Kool-Aid but they're all spiked with New World Order
[03:30.160 --> 03:35.600]  brainwashing cyanide to the soul in the psyche see they can't have Obama and
[03:35.600 --> 03:38.440]  Bush look like they're fighting with each other to keep the false left right
[03:38.440 --> 03:43.560]  paradigm propped up the the the false illusion that there's a choice because
[03:43.560 --> 03:49.040]  they're both pro war pro police state pro open borders pro gun control I mean on
[03:49.040 --> 03:55.520]  every issue NAFTA get expansion of the SPP North American Union integration so
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.000]  they have to have a public fight with the Republicans and Democrats on issues of
[04:00.000 --> 04:08.600]  no significance like oh the White House isn't letting Obama move in early when
[04:08.600 --> 04:14.240]  in reality they have passed off the baton perfectly to each other and Obama is
[04:14.240 --> 04:18.880]  continuing the entire New World Order agenda with just simply a few new
[04:18.880 --> 04:24.280]  talking points and they've adjusted their rhetoric slightly to again fool the
[04:24.280 --> 04:27.720]  public that was the same thing under Clinton they couldn't go after him in
[04:27.720 --> 04:31.640]  Congress for missile secrets of the communist Chinese or high treason or
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.320]  police state or any serious issue like Waco because Republicans were all
[04:35.320 --> 04:39.680]  involved as well so they went after him for Monica Lewinsky and isolated a
[04:39.680 --> 04:45.640]  little issue so another example of the mind control that is going on out there
[04:45.640 --> 04:53.360]  IDF steps up Gaza's strip airstrikes Israel moves forward and sends more
[04:53.360 --> 04:57.680]  troops to Gaza the Economist magazine says U.S. and a depression not a
[04:57.680 --> 05:02.040]  recession stay with us it's all coming up hello friends this is Alex Jones I've
[05:02.040 --> 05:05.560]  told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's
[05:05.560 --> 05:09.440]  more important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the key
[05:09.440 --> 05:12.840]  you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[05:12.840 --> 05:16.520]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.520]  any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good
[05:20.520 --> 05:24.280]  old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do
[05:24.280 --> 05:28.600]  it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion
[05:28.600 --> 05:32.160]  dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[05:32.160 --> 05:36.360]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:36.360 --> 05:40.320]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food
[05:40.320 --> 05:45.040]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[05:45.040 --> 05:49.080]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[05:49.080 --> 05:53.280]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[05:53.280 --> 05:57.120]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:57.120 --> 06:00.720]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:00.720 --> 06:04.880]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:04.880 --> 06:08.400]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[06:08.400 --> 06:12.200]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[06:12.200 --> 06:16.400]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[06:16.400 --> 06:19.320]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[06:19.320 --> 06:22.560]  having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot
[06:22.560 --> 06:26.120]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[06:26.120 --> 06:29.840]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[06:29.840 --> 06:33.240]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[06:33.240 --> 06:37.360]  storeable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese
[06:37.360 --> 06:41.040]  imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices

[07:52.080 --> 07:55.880]  one hour to take your phone calls and break down what's happening with the
[07:55.880 --> 08:01.560]  economy the Israeli Air Force steps up Gaza Strip airstrikes as the Israeli
[08:01.560 --> 08:08.080]  Defense Force prepares to invade Gaza and they are saying that that is now in
[08:08.080 --> 08:13.720]  the cards well I think clearly it is as they build up a massive infantry and
[08:13.720 --> 08:19.720]  armor force preparing to pour in and as the Israelis dance for the cameras in
[08:19.720 --> 08:24.480]  some type of ancient victory dance or war dance that's actually in the New York
[08:24.480 --> 08:30.400]  Times Israel sent more troops to the Gaza border rapidly moving forward with
[08:30.400 --> 08:34.720]  preparations for a possible ground offensive the next stage of its military
[08:34.720 --> 08:40.400]  assault on the coastal territories Hamas rulers Israel rebuff calls by world
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.600]  leaders for a truce and Hamas also was called to the cease fire so we'll get
[08:46.600 --> 08:50.640]  more into that coming up the Economist reports this is a top story up on
[08:50.640 --> 08:54.760]  prisonplanet.com Paul Watson has done an integrated analysis of the article and
[08:54.760 --> 09:02.440]  links to it the Economist US in depression not recession another report
[09:02.440 --> 09:08.920]  here out of Al Jazeera television Gulf States agree on monetary union now a
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.320]  monetary union is a political union that's how the European Union basically
[09:14.320 --> 09:22.520]  operates some can deny the European Union exist they can also deny that the
[09:22.520 --> 09:28.040]  planet exists but it does exist and the African Union exist the Asian Union
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.800]  exist the Mediterranean Union exist the European Union exist the Russian
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.880]  Federation exist and the North American Union publicly has been in
[09:39.880 --> 09:45.400]  existence since 1994 with Dafton Gatt that was a North American Union agreement
[09:45.400 --> 09:52.000]  and is in the document now they're just expanding the control Gulf States agree

[09:57.520 --> 10:02.360]  single currency the secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council has said
[10:02.360 --> 10:06.920]  get more into that but I know most of the listeners this show or in reality and
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.880]  read and research and are aware that there are 10 global unions now
[10:11.880 --> 10:15.800]  publicly being merged into the super world government and the head of the
[10:15.800 --> 10:18.080]  Kissinger Group wrote a book about it this year in the Washington Post
[10:18.080 --> 10:23.040]  trumpeted the book super class we had Roth Cop on you know shang or under
[10:23.040 --> 10:28.680]  world government with 6,000 bureaucrats 6,000 minions of the banks running it
[10:28.680 --> 10:32.680]  that's what he put the elite at you know high-level servants of the elite at
[10:32.680 --> 10:38.360]  6,000 less than 20 families own it doesn't matter again of the financial
[10:38.360 --> 10:40.640]  times of London the Wall Street Journal all announced we're under world
[10:40.640 --> 10:44.000]  government and that now the private central banks will control the 10 global
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.080]  regions they can put it in 100 newspapers a week when I told you three
[10:49.080 --> 10:52.320]  weeks ago when that financial times of London article came out you could
[10:52.320 --> 10:59.280]  Google New World Order and Google news not not web news and it was 5,400 plus
[10:59.280 --> 11:05.400]  news articles so when I say hundreds I mean I looked at more than 200 in a
[11:05.400 --> 11:08.120]  week period I mean I would just click on them click on them click on them and
[11:08.120 --> 11:11.120]  read world governments good world governments loving world governments the
[11:11.120 --> 11:14.640]  answer yes we kept it secret from you it's for your own good the bankers want
[11:14.640 --> 11:17.680]  to save you don't worry you'll pay your carbon tax to them they'll save the
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.800]  earth and then meanwhile I still get emails saying I'm a liar no this exists
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.840]  now most of those are operatives and I look at on our YouTube videos people
[11:25.840 --> 11:31.000]  post and on info wars dot com prison by dot com in the comments you'll see them
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.840]  they'll go in there to say Alex is a liar there's no New World Order he's a
[11:34.840 --> 11:38.800]  liar there's no government sponsored terrorism everything's fine now now
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.480]  those individuals there's no way those are people in denial there's no way
[11:44.480 --> 11:48.880]  they're on YouTube and info wars 24 hours a day posting this stuff I mean
[11:48.880 --> 11:53.480]  they've got to be operatives I mean the Pentagon admits they have tens of
[11:53.480 --> 11:57.880]  thousands the fed feds have hired hundreds of thousands off and on bloggers
[11:57.880 --> 12:01.880]  and disinfo people and fake newscast I mean that's all admitted there's been
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.800]  congressional reports on it we've had guests on that have covered it but still
[12:06.800 --> 12:11.600]  to really see them doing I mean to know that bureaucrats and troops and PR
[12:11.600 --> 12:16.640]  firms sit there and are proud of themselves to go out and try to
[12:16.640 --> 12:20.760]  suppress the American people and say none of this exists so the people won't
[12:20.760 --> 12:24.920]  wake up and fight back against having total control of our nation taken over
[12:24.920 --> 12:30.800]  losing our liberty or sovereignty or freedom it's just it's so mind-boggling
[12:30.800 --> 12:36.240]  and all the FBI training manuals and state police training manuals and
[12:36.240 --> 12:41.640]  the federal martial training manuals that we've gotten ahold of and posted
[12:41.640 --> 12:47.960]  at info wars dot com and prison planet cob over the years the FBI terror flyers
[12:47.960 --> 12:54.680]  they put out what 45,000 of in Phoenix alone and surrounding cities like Tucson
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.680]  saying gun owners are terrorist those that make frequent references the US
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.800]  Constitution or terrorist the public law enforcement magazines that constantly
[13:03.800 --> 13:08.600]  say it I mean I rarely will be in a 7-eleven and I'll just pick one up
[13:08.600 --> 13:12.800]  open it up and the first thing I read is if you see somebody with the get us out
[13:12.800 --> 13:16.000]  of the UN sticker on their car go ahead and arrest them and police chiefs
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.920]  support your officer think of something to keep them in jail this person's a
[13:19.920 --> 13:25.240]  terrorist and then we have the violent radicalization act they're very close to
[13:25.240 --> 13:30.080]  passing in Congress on C-span showing architects and engineers for 9-11 truth
[13:30.080 --> 13:34.440]  next to al-qaeda training videos and saying we have to shut these groups off
[13:34.440 --> 13:41.240]  the web I mean it's on record this is all really happening and then they
[13:41.240 --> 13:46.040]  openly announced world government all the FBI manuals say we're insane it
[13:46.040 --> 13:53.040]  doesn't exist and we're terrorist if we say it exists when it's on the news you
[13:53.040 --> 14:02.520]  know this weekend last weekend I was studying reeducation tactics that the
[14:02.520 --> 14:09.800]  Soviets use that the communists used in Cuba that they used in the Malice use
[14:09.800 --> 14:18.440]  in China I was looking at Pinochet's reeducation camps and I was studying
[14:18.440 --> 14:21.880]  the stuff that goes on at Camp X-ray where they torture you for five six
[14:21.880 --> 14:31.160]  seven years until you'll confess and I wrote some notes I wrote like three
[14:31.160 --> 14:38.200]  pages of notes last weekend on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day yesterday I
[14:38.200 --> 14:42.360]  just couldn't stop working I couldn't stop thinking about the New World Order
[14:42.360 --> 14:45.520]  and how desperate things are and how I want to warn people and that's a normal
[14:45.520 --> 14:50.360]  response when you know that this type of evil is going on that we don't have a
[14:50.360 --> 14:55.560]  choice we've got to fight it we've got to try to stop it and then so I'm thinking
[14:55.560 --> 15:03.120]  about reeducation camps I'm thinking about all of this and the way they
[15:03.120 --> 15:09.280]  reeducate people the way they brainwash them and yesterday at about 11 o'clock I
[15:09.280 --> 15:16.120]  go in to my garage get on the treadmill turn on showtime I didn't write a note
[15:16.120 --> 15:23.200]  on this I believe the name of the film was in the land of the blind and it was
[15:23.200 --> 15:26.560]  all about a fictitious country with brainwashing camps and it's kind of like
[15:26.560 --> 15:36.920]  a 1984 redo but but with new names to make it fresh and they're in there
[15:36.920 --> 15:47.240]  torturing this guy and it's all about mass psychosis mass mental illness you
[15:47.240 --> 15:49.760]  know they come in one day in torturing and say you're gonna confess to this
[15:49.760 --> 15:53.280]  this and that and they come in the next day and say you're not even who you know
[15:53.280 --> 15:56.040]  you think you are this is your real history and they give him some fake
[15:56.040 --> 16:01.320]  history and and he of course was a member of the secret police early on in
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.560]  the revolution and in a hero and then he doesn't want to go along with the mass
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.800]  executions and torture camps he won't sign the loyalty of so they grab him and
[16:09.800 --> 16:13.240]  take him to this torture facility and it ends up he's there for 20 something
[16:13.240 --> 16:21.520]  years and then new governments come in and you know the same thing continues
[16:21.520 --> 16:26.000]  and they keep him in the reeducation camp and I was watching the movie for like
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.760]  an hour on the treadmill and I and I thought to myself I don't think people
[16:30.760 --> 16:35.240]  watching this on showtime understand that it's even worse than what there's
[16:35.240 --> 16:41.680]  seeing in this fictitious movie that reality is far worse and there are so
[16:41.680 --> 16:46.400]  many facets to it I mean the fact that the jail guard types that love to torture
[16:46.400 --> 16:50.960]  people that relish having someone cornered that relish being able to get
[16:50.960 --> 16:56.560]  away with humiliating people and who relish them writhing around their own
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.120]  blood and pain or who relish them strapped down to operating tables being
[17:01.120 --> 17:06.880]  tortured and just how corrupt government and tyranny allows the worst most
[17:06.880 --> 17:13.000]  venomous most delusional most sickening people to get into control and then to
[17:13.000 --> 17:20.040]  have their way and form the world in the image of their dark souls so later I
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.520]  want to try to get into that separately in the news I've been going over here
[17:24.520 --> 17:28.640]  there's a new rumor out you know they had one three or four months ago that went
[17:28.640 --> 17:32.840]  on for six months and I was accused of being a government agent for not going
[17:32.840 --> 17:36.800]  along with it and not talking about it and saying it was all real that flying
[17:36.800 --> 17:43.520]  saucers were gonna giant flying saucers were gonna land in Alabama and then
[17:43.520 --> 17:48.200]  when the giant flying saucers didn't land in Alabama the media could point at
[17:48.200 --> 17:52.240]  the American people and then you know say oh look the flying saucer didn't land
[17:52.240 --> 18:00.160]  and the troops were not under martial law you'll mix that in together and every
[18:00.160 --> 18:04.800]  few months the same parties come out and say that nukes are going to be set off
[18:04.800 --> 18:11.080]  and they always give an exact date and what this does is is it gets everybody
[18:11.080 --> 18:16.320]  to basically just just be so confused by all the fog of propaganda that they
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.480]  never take all the real issues seriously and there's a new one out that
[18:20.480 --> 18:31.000]  January 21st or 22nd Israel or the US are going to be nuked now also a lot of
[18:31.000 --> 18:37.160]  these rumors come from the FBI the CIA Massad MI6 MI5 because they're
[18:37.160 --> 18:42.080]  always putting up you know they'll say very credible reports that terrorists
[18:42.080 --> 18:44.760]  are gonna attack next week you know they're gonna attack Times Square they're
[18:44.760 --> 18:49.440]  going to they're going to attack New Year's Eve so we got to have troops on
[18:49.440 --> 18:53.000]  the streets and then that's used as a way to condition the public everybody's
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.400]  tuned in to Times Square a cartoon into the Super Bowl or Kentucky Derby and
[18:57.400 --> 19:01.680]  there are the troops knowing around with machine guns searching citizens
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.200]  bags and then the terror attack doesn't come we'll we'll talk about the

[23:31.520 --> 23:38.640]  the world want world government well it's real simple these people have more
[23:38.640 --> 23:41.760]  money than they could ever quote spend they control the central banks that
[23:41.760 --> 23:51.520]  issue the currency the credit the control world comp commerce it's all
[23:51.520 --> 23:55.400]  about control they need to be the government they need to have control of
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.160]  government and then they can amass even more power and control themselves and
[24:00.160 --> 24:04.120]  play God and make everybody live according to the edicts that they put
[24:04.120 --> 24:11.000]  out and throughout history the worst people the most cunning the most vicious
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.320]  the most deceptive the most diabolical tend to get into power about about 99
[24:16.320 --> 24:20.800]  percent of the time and I know I talk about that a lot because that's just
[24:20.800 --> 24:26.880]  history and that's just facts and it is just a huge insult to anyone who knows
[24:26.880 --> 24:30.000]  history anyone who has common sense to have the media and the corporate
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.560]  controlled media who openly is owned by the establishment who shown themselves
[24:33.560 --> 24:37.320]  to be completely wicked telling you no there's no corruption we're good and
[24:37.320 --> 24:40.560]  sweet and you know we have your best-interested heart when they clearly
[24:40.560 --> 24:47.280]  don't and when we come face-to-face with something so monstrous so huge so
[24:47.280 --> 24:51.600]  diabolical the average person because we're not of that ill just has trouble
[24:51.600 --> 25:01.680]  dealing with it we're like an organism you know let's say we're like a kangaroo
[25:01.680 --> 25:09.000]  in Australia that's been isolated on that island for eons and then another
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.920]  marsupials introduced that has similar genetics and is carrying a disease and
[25:12.920 --> 25:22.440]  and it wipes out half of the kangaroos or in a real case the Australian rat has
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.440]  almost been completely wiped out by the European brown rat because of the
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.760]  diseases it brought that that particular European rat had immunity to but the
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.640]  indigenous rat in Australia didn't
[25:37.240 --> 25:42.240]  well it's the same thing to political ideas and political systems the United
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.320]  States has had corruption problems certain key minority groups being abused
[25:46.320 --> 25:52.440]  and used but in the general system the Anglo-Saxon system they would not allow
[25:52.440 --> 25:58.520]  tyranny against their own people and it was not as accepted as it has been in
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.160]  other parts of the world in all other cultures so for that limited space of
[26:02.160 --> 26:07.560]  time we had a modicum of liberty and freedom and incredible wealth and ideas
[26:07.560 --> 26:13.640]  and ingenuity was turned loose because you didn't have a tiny cloistered elite
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.760]  controlling information controlling technology being able to suppress
[26:17.760 --> 26:26.280]  populations that's why when the black plague hit in 1640s or whenever it was
[26:26.280 --> 26:31.600]  right around that time and wiped out about half of Europe and much of the
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.600]  elite the bureaucracy of the Dark Ages broke down and then local towns and
[26:37.600 --> 26:42.760]  cities were finally able to actually have a little bit of freedom I mean if
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.120]  you tried to build a new windmill they'd say you're a witch for having a new
[26:47.120 --> 26:50.840]  system and they'd kill you because there'd be one family in the town who was
[26:50.840 --> 26:55.040]  under the nobles control who had an old windmill system and they didn't want
[26:55.040 --> 26:58.400]  competition and so they just say you were a warlock because you invented
[26:58.400 --> 27:02.040]  something new and kill you or let's say you studied the moon you studied the
[27:02.040 --> 27:08.760]  stars you studied you know math math they would just say you were a warlock
[27:08.760 --> 27:11.760]  and kill you or put you on house arrest because they were threatened there was a
[27:11.760 --> 27:17.120]  monopoly of serfdom and that's the biggest issue of why we don't want to
[27:17.120 --> 27:22.000]  live under tyranny a system where you've got to be FCC approved to have a radio
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.480]  show and then they politically go after who they don't like you know that's a
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.080]  least a less extreme model of what you see in the old Soviet Union and China
[27:32.080 --> 27:35.960]  today and more and more they're setting that up here in the United States where
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.440]  they want to come in shut down regulate control the web you know first they say
[27:39.440 --> 27:43.560]  well you can't say that there was not a holocaust or you can't even question the
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.560]  holocaust now now again I'm not even waiting in on that debate I'm saying
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.240]  they take something that sounds reasonable to the public and then they
[27:52.240 --> 27:57.640]  set a precedent with that and now they're saying in Europe and the US we need
[27:57.640 --> 28:02.160]  to pass laws that if you deny global warming you get arrested that's being
[28:02.160 --> 28:08.800]  proposed in Congress they're passing laws like that in Europe and then pretty
[28:08.800 --> 28:13.480]  soon oh you can't criticize Israel's attack on Gaza that's anti-semitic and
[28:13.480 --> 28:20.600]  so YouTube France has been banning any videos that criticize it well they want
[28:20.600 --> 28:27.800]  to try to bring those same filtering systems here and there's so many examples
[28:27.800 --> 28:32.000]  of these attempts where we're in you know take in East Germany or in the Soviet
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.040]  Union you had to be approved to be a playwright and only limited little plays
[28:36.040 --> 28:40.040]  could be on and the fat cat nobodies you know the bureaucrats the secret police
[28:40.040 --> 28:44.240]  would sit in the front row and demand to have sex with the starlet and if she
[28:44.240 --> 28:48.160]  didn't have sex with them she would never be on the stage again you know
[28:48.160 --> 28:53.960]  that's how all of this works sick nobodies with no talent other than
[28:53.960 --> 28:57.280]  getting in control of government ruling over everyone and having their butts
[28:57.280 --> 29:03.240]  kissed it's disgusting we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[32:45.840 --> 33:02.120]  2 you know while I'm listening to this song I'm watching a video clip of
[33:02.120 --> 33:11.760]  the rock Obama on gun control i.e. victim disarmament enslavement of the
[33:11.760 --> 33:21.480]  people and the public is finally going back and reading his handwritten notes
[33:21.480 --> 33:28.280]  on bills that he wrote when he was a state senator from Illinois where he
[33:28.280 --> 33:35.200]  wants absolute complete total gun ban of quote civilians in this military
[33:35.200 --> 33:41.720]  dictatorship and now he's not really backpedaling he's saying well I mean I'm
[33:41.720 --> 33:46.560]  not saying we can you know laterally ban all guns right at once but we've got to
[33:46.560 --> 33:51.960]  have reasonable restrictions and he says reasonable is the DC gun ban you can
[33:51.960 --> 33:57.840]  own absolutely no firearm of any type in the district of criminals and last
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.000]  night I mean I knew he was anti-gun I'd read his votes in the u.s. Senate in the
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.400]  Illinois Senate I had studied Obama I knew it but last night for about two
[34:08.400 --> 34:14.000]  hours I mean I can't stop all I do is study this information I have a huge
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.640]  stack of notes I wrote that I want to go over the frustration is there's so much
[34:19.640 --> 34:24.800]  proof and I I've got six or seven YouTube clips that are all about 10 minutes
[34:24.800 --> 34:30.520]  long with all of his flip-flopping and deception and the actual bills he
[34:30.520 --> 34:38.360]  passed or lobbied for I've got a video clip of Biden saying that he was shown a
[34:38.360 --> 34:42.280]  YouTube clip during a debate a lot of you've probably seen it with the person
[34:42.280 --> 34:46.600]  holding up his semi-automatic m16 is air 15 saying you're not going to take my
[34:46.600 --> 34:51.240]  baby are you the governor Richardson says no I'm not going to take your baby
[34:51.240 --> 34:57.280]  and Biden looks totally shocked and says yes you shouldn't be able to own that
[34:57.280 --> 35:01.840]  gun you need to have it confiscated and please don't come after me with it and
[35:01.840 --> 35:07.800]  he's physically shaken by it because as a bully as a criminal as a murderer as a
[35:07.800 --> 35:14.880]  9-11 complicit operative with General Mammut Ahmed meeting with him on the
[35:14.880 --> 35:21.360]  day of 9-11 the money being wired from Muhammad out of all of it he starts
[35:21.360 --> 35:28.160]  bragging goes I authored the assault weapons ban and he's just I mean the
[35:28.160 --> 35:31.960]  video I'm gonna play it during the live prison planet TV transmission come up
[35:31.960 --> 35:37.160]  couple hours he is completely just taken aback and shocked and and and freaked
[35:37.160 --> 35:44.560]  out by a slave that would hold up his AR-15 on a YouTube clip he was one of the
[35:44.560 --> 35:50.720]  CNN YouTube reporters and said and his whole instinct is this is horrible we've
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.360]  got a slave that's armed because now we can't have our way with him and then
[35:55.360 --> 36:04.120]  Biden implies the guy's gonna come after him with the rifle but then Biden loves
[36:04.120 --> 36:08.840]  the SWAT teams and armored police and openly saying that they want to use
[36:08.840 --> 36:14.400]  troops against the American people and openly saying well we support reasonable
[36:14.400 --> 36:21.260]  gun control and then they go on to say reasonable is a total gun ban they
[36:21.260 --> 36:26.080]  support the Chicago gun ban and the District of Columbia gun ban and the
[36:26.080 --> 36:33.080]  New York City gun ban which of course then in one of these clips Obama goes
[36:33.080 --> 36:39.520]  on to say well I mean we've got to have sensible gun control look at Chicago
[36:39.520 --> 36:47.720]  look at my old state Senate district it you know they have dozens and dozens of
[36:47.720 --> 36:54.480]  murders every every week with guns as if the guns did it well absolutely
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.960]  Chicago has the highest crime rate in the country on average year to year
[36:59.960 --> 37:03.120]  sometimes at their second place sometimes third place but on average it is
[37:03.120 --> 37:07.720]  the most crime-ridden city in the country mafia run and of course a mafia run
[37:07.720 --> 37:11.760]  city not bashing Chicago they're great folks I like the people up there my
[37:11.760 --> 37:15.880]  cousin lives up there they love us on the radio up in Chicago we've over the
[37:15.880 --> 37:22.720]  years had quite a few affiliates up there but the people know that's why
[37:22.720 --> 37:26.480]  they identify with this radio show because they're not stupid they've
[37:26.480 --> 37:30.440]  lived under it you've got this mafia don run city for over a hundred years
[37:30.440 --> 37:35.160]  where they have disarmed the people and then every criminal in the nation
[37:35.160 --> 37:40.360]  basically moves up there to the point of it's just war in the streets because the
[37:40.360 --> 37:44.720]  citizens are quote law abiding and won't arm themselves you know there's been
[37:44.720 --> 37:49.880]  famous cases quite a few of them of people million mom marchers and others
[37:49.880 --> 37:54.560]  I always called the 100 bureaucrat march that's normally what it is every time
[37:54.560 --> 37:57.800]  they have an Austin it's like a hundred well-known bureaucrats trying to you know
[37:57.800 --> 38:03.240]  push disarming their quarry that there there would be prey the people parasites
[38:03.240 --> 38:06.680]  that know what they're doing is unpopular knowing that rebellions in the
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.760]  wind so they have the instinct to disarm their slaves their prey just like a
[38:11.760 --> 38:15.440]  bank robber comes into a bank and says hands up to the security guard and takes
[38:15.440 --> 38:19.080]  his gun away I mean oh they're robbing us they come in they say hands up give
[38:19.080 --> 38:29.600]  us the gun so they can have their way but there's a lot of famous cases where
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.000]  million mom marchers and others would stick a sign or in their yard on their
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.240]  house saying this is a gun-free zone and then they get robbed because criminals
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.960]  driving around who want to steal your jewelry steal your computers steal your
[38:44.960 --> 38:51.960]  silver you know whatever it is they they go around looking and that's why home
[38:51.960 --> 38:55.720]  invasions depending on which federal or state number you look on are more than
[38:55.720 --> 39:04.480]  30 times higher in New York City 30 times in Chicago everybody gets broken
[39:04.480 --> 39:11.600]  into there it's just ongoing being robbed because they know nine times out of
[39:11.600 --> 39:15.280]  ten when they go in your house you're not going to be armed and so they have
[39:15.280 --> 39:21.360]  home invasions while you're there here in Texas or Florida or Arizona or
[39:21.360 --> 39:27.440]  Vermont they will wait they will watch they will case they will wait till
[39:27.440 --> 39:30.880]  everybody goes to work they will watch they will and then they will go in and
[39:30.880 --> 39:36.560]  rob you but that's not how it is in places like Chicago places like New
[39:36.560 --> 39:41.920]  York City because they know they've got disarmed slaves in there that can't
[39:41.920 --> 39:45.120]  defend as just another class of criminal you've got the government class of
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.200]  criminal the more intelligent psychopaths sociopaths that know how they can
[39:49.200 --> 39:52.520]  get into positions of power and more safely carry out their operations
[39:52.520 --> 39:59.200]  against the public and then you've got the on the street criminal you know
[39:59.200 --> 40:06.640]  advertising that you're armed advertising it's like a porcupine saying
[40:06.640 --> 40:12.360]  don't tread on me and the wolves the coyotes leave them alone porcupines a
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.880]  little creature but a grizzly bear won't come over and attack it it may do it
[40:16.880 --> 40:22.040]  one time but it learns it's less and getting those quills in its snow
[40:25.400 --> 40:33.760]  I mean that's why I advertise the fact that right here I got a 45 Kimber to my
[40:33.760 --> 40:42.280]  left and to my right I got a 357 Magnum Taurus because I want it on record
[40:42.280 --> 40:48.400]  and other folks in my office have concealed carry I want it on record
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.360]  that you come here to do violence you come here to steal you die it's just
[40:54.360 --> 40:59.560]  that simple no if fans are but you come here to do harm to me you die or you
[40:59.560 --> 41:05.920]  better believe one of us is gonna die you pull a gun out you pull a knife out
[41:05.920 --> 41:10.600]  you pull a baseball bat out you come at me I'm not gonna talk to you I'm not
[41:10.600 --> 41:19.440]  gonna say hands up I'm not gonna say anything I'm gonna say talk to the 45
[41:19.440 --> 41:35.800]  round APC talk to the 357 Hall of Point it's just that simple I am not
[41:35.800 --> 41:40.280]  yielded I am not a slave I am a free man and the symbol of that the ultimate
[41:40.280 --> 41:47.200]  crown of freedom is the two things free speech that I will speak my mind and the
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.480]  second amendment I am armed I'm just like a porcupine why do you think the
[41:53.480 --> 42:00.560]  revolutionary flag out of South Carolina was a snake a rattlesnake and it says
[42:00.560 --> 42:07.520]  don't tread on me I got a rattle I'm not looking for trouble I'm telling you
[42:07.520 --> 42:14.840]  I'm telling you I'm rattling my tail do not mess with me do not play games with
[42:14.840 --> 42:21.680]  me you see that rattle I got up in the air I'm letting you know and everybody's
[42:21.680 --> 42:25.520]  letting the New World Order know and they can't stand it they are so outraged
[42:25.520 --> 42:29.120]  you know on the floor of the house back in the 90s this was picked up by
[42:29.120 --> 42:35.040]  national television Cerebrady got up on the floor gave her speech she was an
[42:35.040 --> 42:37.960]  invited speaker and then turned while the microphone was still on and said
[42:37.960 --> 42:41.360]  we're only gonna have a socialist America once the people are disarmed we can
[42:41.360 --> 42:47.000]  carry out our operation when they say socialist America they mean taking all
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.800]  your wealth and everything your ideas your labor and stealing it for
[42:50.800 --> 42:56.240]  themselves they know you know they got a bunch of gun control minions who were
[42:56.240 --> 43:00.760]  brought up in cities never around firearms scared of them superstitious of
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.320]  them in citizens hands not in the police hands they love that they just love
[43:04.320 --> 43:12.600]  bowing down to it they've got a bunch of useful idiots that don't know but the
[43:12.600 --> 43:18.760]  controllers the pushers of this they are predatory they know and the same banks
[43:18.760 --> 43:21.800]  that funded Hitler the same banks that funded linen and Stalin and funded
[43:21.800 --> 43:25.960]  Mao publicly it's all declassified that the US government and the British
[43:25.960 --> 43:31.920]  government financed it all to do their dirty work to kill Christians to kill
[43:31.920 --> 43:37.160]  conservatives to kill landowners to kill the middle class they want to do it here
[43:37.160 --> 43:41.080]  and make no mistake that's their instinct that's their drive that's their
[43:41.080 --> 43:45.840]  MO and absolutely ladies and gentlemen it warms my heart to know that the gun
[43:45.840 --> 43:49.600]  sales haven't slowed the all-time record when Obama got elected it's only
[43:49.600 --> 43:54.200]  intensified and he comes out and says don't worry I don't want to ban all your
[43:54.200 --> 44:05.000]  guns just sensible restrictions like Chicago and DC total ban I mean you can
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.040]  go if you know the sheriff or kiss the hind end of the bureaucrats and make
[44:09.040 --> 44:12.000]  twenty thirty thousand dollars in donations to him that's come out in New
[44:12.000 --> 44:15.200]  York City then maybe you get a concealed carry it turned out only rich
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.320]  mafia had concealed carry because they can make twenty thirty thousand dollar
[44:18.320 --> 44:21.680]  donations a year to campaigns sure enough their concealed carry comes through
[44:21.680 --> 44:25.760]  see first New York what thirty forty years ago turn to write into a privilege
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.160]  said you got to have a permit but you know it's only five dollars and then
[44:29.160 --> 44:34.160]  oh now it's a hundred and oh now we just don't issue those and then suddenly
[44:34.160 --> 44:43.040]  the cops became corrupt and arrogant and abusive and crime exploded and you
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.760]  noticed in the LA riots is the inner city population was burning down the
[44:48.760 --> 44:52.560]  city the only areas that didn't get burned with the Korean areas because they
[44:52.560 --> 44:56.200]  didn't care they didn't care what the establishment said they were going to go
[44:56.200 --> 44:59.080]  up on top their houses on top their businesses they were going to defend
[44:59.080 --> 45:03.400]  themselves you notice the cops stood back they stood down they're not going
[45:03.400 --> 45:07.320]  to really put themselves in harm's way when there's a real crisis in fact in
[45:07.320 --> 45:11.640]  take New Orleans the FEMA jam the police communications made them stand down
[45:11.640 --> 45:14.560]  came in and cut the police communication lines because they wanted to be able to
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.040]  bring troops in and set the precedent and then five days later they didn't bring
[45:18.040 --> 45:22.200]  food and water the troops commanded by the FBI and big flatbed trucks came in
[45:22.200 --> 45:25.720]  and went into the high and dry areas to loot the homes and steal people's guns
[45:25.720 --> 45:30.360]  and jewels in front of everyone and they'd go into those high and dry homes
[45:30.360 --> 45:33.720]  with generators and food and power and they'd sit there and line them up with
[45:33.720 --> 45:36.800]  their hands up and put handcuffs on them and ship them out to the sports dome
[45:36.800 --> 45:42.560]  and confiscate their guns and now cops have been caught the feds have been
[45:42.560 --> 45:49.560]  caught selling those weapons all over the country the government is criminal and
[45:49.560 --> 45:53.200]  bankrupt and reprobate and there's no denying that look I'm already getting
[45:53.200 --> 45:57.480]  into my rant about the economy I haven't gotten in my rant yet about the
[45:57.480 --> 46:00.240]  economy and I want to get into that later I'm getting into the second
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.960]  amendment and playing some of these amazing clips so Israeli air force
[46:04.960 --> 46:08.880]  steps up guns the strip air strikes Israel is moving more troops up to the
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.920]  border and basically well they're saying they may invade that's probable that
[46:13.920 --> 46:20.000]  they're going to invade with quote round incursions and then I have this
[46:20.000 --> 46:26.720]  dis info that's being put out that the US or Israel will be nuked on the 21st
[46:26.720 --> 46:32.240]  or 22nd you've got to watch these dates that are put out now I have noticed that
[46:32.240 --> 46:35.840]  the 10 richest billionaires in Israel sold their houses in the last year and
[46:35.840 --> 46:41.600]  left left Tel Aviv left Jerusalem so that does say something but you can't
[46:41.600 --> 46:48.320]  put a date on it and I meant to earlier comment on this it came out what five
[46:48.320 --> 46:52.040]  years ago Ari Fleischer had to admit when I was secretary at the time that the
[46:52.040 --> 46:55.120]  White House was putting out fake terror alerts every time they had a political
[46:55.120 --> 46:59.040]  scandal as a way to get people to rally around them and feel like that they were
[46:59.040 --> 47:06.160]  their saviors and basically coward and so the feds constantly put out they'll say
[47:06.160 --> 47:10.520]  very credible specific threat you know there's going to be a tax every holiday
[47:10.520 --> 47:16.400]  every Christmas every New Year's every every holiday when they know people are
[47:16.400 --> 47:20.960]  at home watching TV they want to dominate everybody senses when people
[47:20.960 --> 47:24.200]  aren't in the rat race when people aren't not really paying attention when
[47:24.200 --> 47:28.280]  people are reflective the globalist engineers want to come in and get in
[47:28.280 --> 47:32.240]  everybody's face and say credible threats on subways and buses and highways
[47:32.240 --> 47:36.960]  and schools al-Qaeda is gonna hit and Dick Cheney remember right before the
[47:36.960 --> 47:41.920]  2004 election came out and said you know we will be hit by nukes and US News and
[47:41.920 --> 47:45.920]  World Report it's going to happen and then a week later they go oh it actually
[47:45.920 --> 47:49.760]  wasn't a substantiated credible report that it turns out they were fake reports
[47:49.760 --> 47:52.840]  well the same thing they said the army will be out in Times Square and other
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.400]  major cities but in New York so again they hog all the attention everybody's
[47:56.400 --> 48:03.560]  watching the the ball come down I forgot to do it I was busy researching did
[48:03.560 --> 48:06.760]  somebody tape that because I was told I got I saw it in the news and the
[48:06.760 --> 48:10.960]  Associated Press I saw photos of somebody did somebody video that can
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.080]  somebody mail that to us quick as I want to put a clip of it in the new
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.680]  Obama film with the troops all grandstanding it's all about them it's
[48:18.680 --> 48:22.160]  all about we're in America we're your saviors get used us searching people's
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.560]  bags in Times Square everybody gets searched don't feel bad you're all slaves
[48:26.560 --> 48:31.960]  al-Qaeda is gonna strike just like Mumbai just like India you know they're
[48:31.960 --> 48:38.000]  gonna hit they're gonna hit turns out of course they didn't hit but it's all
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.080]  part of hogging the spotlight always encroaching on your psyche at every major
[48:42.080 --> 48:52.760]  event Christmas Thanksgiving New Year's the Super Bowl the Kentucky Derby top
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.760]  boxing matches anywhere they know tens of millions of people are tuned in

[49:05.280 --> 49:08.680]  all of this conditioning and I told you it was all conditioning for troops to go
[49:08.680 --> 49:11.560]  on the streets nationwide because the government admitted that now they're
[49:11.560 --> 49:14.400]  openly saying oh yeah we're gonna use the army against the American people
[49:14.400 --> 49:17.800]  during unrest there's nothing to do with al-Qaeda but see they told you was
[49:17.800 --> 49:21.580]  always about al-Qaeda but then they conditioned you at the college even
[49:21.580 --> 49:26.360]  college football games we have video and photos to marshal law that made back in
[49:26.360 --> 49:33.960]  2005 searching three-year-olds purses and then it wasn't just football games
[49:33.960 --> 49:37.520]  then it was Bay Fest in Alabama and they'll you know the whole city center
[49:37.520 --> 49:44.120]  all the armies here they're gonna search your bags so they're always

[53:54.040 --> 54:00.240]  phones on the economy on the police state on marshal law on what you think's
[54:00.240 --> 54:05.840]  coming up in the next year how are the feds gonna stage mass shootings well
[54:05.840 --> 54:13.760]  like the other cases it'll be the sons of former top Air Force psychiatrist in
[54:13.760 --> 54:18.520]  mind control programs they'll be you know it'll be children that grew up on
[54:18.520 --> 54:26.440]  military bases they would have been in psychiatric care and then you know the
[54:26.440 --> 54:31.080]  schools will stand down half the school won't be there that day because the
[54:31.080 --> 54:34.960]  insiders will warn all their children the police will stand down be ordered to
[54:34.960 --> 54:40.800]  stand down while the sigh up while the mass shooting goes on so they're gonna
[54:40.800 --> 54:46.680]  stage some of those and I think it's gonna be big I'm predicting that in the
[54:46.680 --> 54:52.960]  first year of Obama they're gonna stage some big mass shootings and it's gonna
[54:52.960 --> 54:55.600]  be really obvious because they're gonna want graphic video they're gonna
[54:55.600 --> 54:58.840]  release the surveillance video of you know children having their heads blown
[54:58.840 --> 55:02.160]  off you know you can be in a fast-food restaurant to that's one of their
[55:02.160 --> 55:07.040]  favorites or an amusement park but of course then there's not just the
[55:07.040 --> 55:10.400]  programming grabbing people drugging them shock therapy and that's all
[55:10.400 --> 55:13.960]  declassified for mine control oh yeah on record it's not just Hollywood
[55:13.960 --> 55:19.680]  movies just Google CA mine control dr. Ewing Cameron under any of those you'll
[55:19.680 --> 55:27.800]  find it the culture itself is under mind control just the violence that on on
[55:27.800 --> 55:32.040]  television the culture the video games the conditioning and all the studies show
[55:32.040 --> 55:36.360]  it destroys the inhibition to taking life to killing people to simulate
[55:36.360 --> 55:41.440]  murdering thousands of people every day playing we shoot them up games to to
[55:41.440 --> 55:48.160]  then watch all these slasher films I mean the television is a mind control
[55:48.160 --> 55:55.880]  instrument the flicker rate was is Pentagon designed and fine-tuned so
[55:55.880 --> 56:00.360]  the culture itself also the fed stage a few mass shootings then they advertise
[56:00.360 --> 56:03.560]  it and then copycats who were always hopped up on serotonin reuptake
[56:03.560 --> 56:07.120]  inhibitors they're always on Prozac class of drugs which they know causes
[56:07.120 --> 56:11.960]  psychopathic breaks that's was in its own trials in the 80s now now I'm on the
[56:11.960 --> 56:17.560]  inserts of all those drugs by law we push for that it's in their mind that
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.800]  that's what they do well you know my wife's divorcing me she's over there
[56:22.800 --> 56:27.320]  having a Christmas party I'm a defense contractor it's always defense
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.080]  contractors because they're in a culture of evil I'll just dress up like Santa
[56:31.080 --> 56:33.640]  Claus and go in and shoot nine people and burn the place down and kill
[56:33.640 --> 56:40.080]  myself so I think that's mind control direct mind control though they always
[56:40.080 --> 56:46.040]  seem to be defense related that is a copycat because it's advertised I mean
[56:46.040 --> 56:49.960]  they've done federal studies when they started the federal death education
[56:49.960 --> 56:54.080]  which actually teaches you about suicide and how to commit suicide very sick
[56:54.080 --> 56:58.040]  you know the schools are reeducation camps teachers don't even know this
[56:58.040 --> 57:01.160]  they've been more reeducated and they're continuing education anybody else
[57:01.160 --> 57:05.360]  they're given a false reason while they do it when there's a real reason and
[57:05.360 --> 57:09.800]  Columbine was the first school in the nation in 1990 according to 2020 because
[57:09.800 --> 57:14.800]  they had deaths and suicides there before the mass shootings record
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.440]  suicides at Columbine because it was a particular you know military base run
[57:18.440 --> 57:23.240]  brainwashing camp they would have the children get in coffins claustrophobic
[57:23.240 --> 57:26.880]  teach them how to commit suicide teach them how to hang themselves like little
[57:26.880 --> 57:30.080]  girls get depressed and this is how they hang themselves it's so easy don't
[57:30.080 --> 57:33.280]  ever put it around your neck and tie the rope to the bathroom stall and the
[57:33.280 --> 57:36.920]  little girls think oh I'm depressed I'm going into puberty I need to commit
[57:36.920 --> 57:40.800]  suicide and then suicide explodes and then there's even more suicide education
[57:40.800 --> 57:44.080]  and the suicide even increases we got to put more people on riddling and prozac
[57:44.080 --> 57:50.080]  that makes them commit suicide even more to stop the suicide thank you for
[57:50.080 --> 58:02.760]  listening to GCN on September 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[58:02.760 --> 58:07.600]  I went to ground here and we knew what to do at least we thought we did truth

[59:20.560 --> 59:28.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[59:28.280 --> 59:40.520]  all right into the second hour of this first live transmission since the new
[59:40.520 --> 59:47.000]  year began 2009 January 2 Bob Chapman with us for the next 60 minutes we're
[59:47.000 --> 59:51.840]  gonna go live at prison planet dot TV in the third and fourth hours today and I'm
[59:51.840 --> 59:58.120]  gonna break down the real gun control agenda starting in the next hour then
[59:58.120 --> 1:00:04.000]  I've got a bunch of other news I want to go over I remember seeing the Baltimore
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:11.720]  Sun about seven years ago with a headline of concerning DARPA testing
[1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:16.760]  towers for mine control and it said they were testing different frequencies
[1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:21.600]  different ultrasound to soothe the public during civil unrest and emergencies
[1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:26.960]  and I've seen patents from the 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s nothing's been declassified
[1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:31.280]  really since then about DARPA the folks that brought you the internet and most
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:34.040]  the technology you see because they control the major corporations then
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:39.440]  they decide what's made public what's not and you know so you've got real
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:42.520]  schizophrenics out there running around thinking you know the Sun's following
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:45.560]  them in the sky I've seen I had a couple schizophrenics come around going look
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:49.840]  it's it's following me and I'm like no that's the Sun or the moon so you do
[1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:53.760]  have nuts out there and the media focuses in on those poor folks who've got a
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:57.280]  chemical imbalance generally of heavy metals they found mercury and lead leads
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:06.640]  to a lot of later onset of schizophrenia but they have systems citywide and they
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:09.720]  admit that these are being tested in US cities Singapore was the first to test
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:16.560]  them that we know of decades ago to to to mine control the population and I
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:20.640]  have an article here this is not a spectrum magazine for tech insiders you
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:27.320]  know mainline publication sound waves for brain waves and it goes on to say
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:31.640]  that researchers at Arizona State University in Tempe have developed a
[1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:36.160]  new use to it to control brain activity from the outside the skull well I mean
[1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:43.640]  DARPA admits they're working with sound waves that again you don't hear they're
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:52.360]  they're they're subaudible or or or you know above the range of hearing and I
[1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:58.040]  remember how ten years ago I had the CEO on of a company that it was testing it
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:01.440]  in Tokyo at the time now it's around the country but people freak out when I
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:06.320]  hear it where from 50 yards away as you walk in there's a zone they've got a
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.760]  infrared scanner shooting out that recognizes a human and then it projects
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:16.240]  into your skull these tones and it tells you drink coca-cola were delicious
[1:02:16.240 --> 1:02:20.280]  refreshing but people thought they were going crazy so they've discontinued and
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:25.320]  then I'll cover that on air and people say that doesn't exist you're crazy I
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:31.040]  mean they won't go look it up that they have vending machines have you seen
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.640]  minority report everything in minority report is what they already had years
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:40.240]  before that film even came out I mean it's not even that accurate to the
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:44.160]  Philip K. Dick book they just kind of took some of his story about the psychic
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:48.040]  precogs and then kind of interlaced the retina scanners everywhere you know
[1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:51.200]  speaking to you individually the billboards as you walk through the
[1:02:51.200 --> 1:02:56.840]  subway system that's already in place it's just the Pentagon runs that they're
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:00.200]  not really announcing it to you at this time you're being tracked the cameras are
[1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:03.960]  hooked in Chicago is trying to pass a law so is New York London's already doing
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:07.360]  it we're by law all your internal surveillance cameras or business
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:10.920]  cameras that will be wired into the feds they've got digital photos of everybody
[1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:13.800]  that gets a license or ID they're tracking you in real time that's the
[1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:17.280]  secret weapon Bob Woodward's been talking about where they set up checkpoints
[1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:21.200]  around Baghdad around Fallujah and make everybody for their food stamps even if
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:24.560]  you don't want food stamps you have to do it do a face scan digital voice print
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:28.600]  all that's put on a card I videotape Marines in 99 in Oakland with the role
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:33.440]  players playing the part of enrolling Americans in the camp database then
[1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.800]  they're let out of the camp later some of them those that aren't killed and then
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:41.640]  they have their face scanner everywhere they go and now they've got satellites
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:46.720]  that do it but not a face scan it's a shadow scan and a gate scan you know
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:53.720]  your your walk your gate how you step a algorithmic system they claim it's a
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:57.120]  hundred percent no so I wanted you to know about that and they do have the
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:03.480]  towers up and they are practicing screwing with everybody and playing God
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:06.480]  so I hope you enjoy it and it's right here in the mainstream news we'll be
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:10.400]  right back with Bob Chapman hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a
[1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:13.520]  long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:16.960]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the
[1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:20.200]  key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:23.680]  you'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:27.640]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:31.120]  wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:35.000]  screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.840]  $850 billion at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:44.040]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:48.000]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.720]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:56.720]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks
[1:04:56.720 --> 1:05:00.960]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[1:05:00.960 --> 1:05:04.800]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:08.400]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:12.560]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:16.600]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:20.280]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:24.640]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:27.640]  there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a supply
[1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:31.360]  of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:35.680]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one
[1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:39.000]  is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you you know e
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.840]  foods direct comm is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E. coli
[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:46.640]  salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half

[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:19.360]  first step is getting storeable food he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones
[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:37.240]  on the GCN radio network before time gets away from me I wanted to briefly tell
[1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:43.040]  the listeners out there that if you really want to wake up your friends your
[1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:46.560]  family your neighbors if we're gonna have any chance of hearing this around
[1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:50.160]  information is key and folks didn't want to know about the private fellow
[1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:54.400]  reserve at least a large portion of them five ten twenty years ago when so many
[1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:57.800]  valiant people like Bob Chapman been doing this for almost 50 years we're
[1:06:57.800 --> 1:07:01.280]  trying to warn him and you know he helped put out the buck with Gary Allen that
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:06.160]  sold millions and millions of copies an undare call of conspiracy that really
[1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:12.080]  finally woke me up when I was a teenager you know to the wider world to the
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:16.960]  reality the bet but but now we're a visual society and I believe the film
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:22.800]  people need to see is the money masters how banks create the world's money and
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:26.440]  Thomas Jefferson said if the American people ever allow private banks to
[1:07:26.440 --> 1:07:30.360]  control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the
[1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:34.400]  banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up
[1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:39.280]  homeless on the continent their father's conquered the issuing and suing
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.040]  power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it
[1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:48.320]  properly belongs here's James Madison history records that the money
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:52.200]  changers have used every form of abuse intrigue deceit and violent means
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:55.600]  possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:00.120]  its issuance James Madison now you tell an FBI agent today hey the private
[1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:03.360]  federal service private they're setting up a world government here they are in
[1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:07.120]  hundreds of publications mainstream news saying it the FBI agent will say you
[1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:11.360]  were insane it doesn't exist you are a terrorist and you can say but the
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:15.960]  founding fathers fought the same people and they'll say hey my training manual
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:20.720]  says they were bad and by the way I'm not joking you didn't know the training
[1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.840]  manuals actually say the founding fathers were terrorist and bad see I
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:29.000]  mean we're that's what this giant reeducation camp is is they're teaching
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:34.040]  the public to be mentally ill and then those of us that are sane those of us
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:39.640]  that that research how society operates in what the elite is openly saying
[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:47.120]  they're doing and going to do they've been told we're insane doesn't matter if
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.520]  we tell you three years before they're gonna pop the subprime mortgage or
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:54.680]  bring in world government and then it happens doesn't matter if we're right
[1:08:54.680 --> 1:09:00.200]  about everything doesn't matter if we're spot on they will just say it isn't
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:05.000]  happening well to their own peril so I hope you'll go to info wars dot com and

[1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:41.480]  therefore and all of our activities are in the hands of a few men we have come
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:45.680]  to be one of the most worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:49.160]  dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government of free
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:53.440]  opinion no longer government by conviction and the vote of the majority
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:57.080]  but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:02.160]  men Woodrow Wilson and he was hired he wrote the book New World Order called
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:05.600]  for world government was fooled by the Federal Reserve bankers then he went
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:08.320]  public sort of giving speeches writing letters and they murdered him
[1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:15.120]  poisoned him and his wife later wrote about that and released a lot of his

[1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:10.200]  okay that said for the rest of the hour we've got Bob Chapman with us at a time
[1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:13.480]  before he retired the biggest golden silver private broker in the world he
[1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:16.960]  also the largest financial newsletter in the world and he retired he's come back
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:20.800]  in the last decade and has one of the biggest yet again the international
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:26.600]  forecaster dot com and I wanted to get him on today about the economist one of
[1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:29.920]  the most prestigious financial publications saying u.s. in depression
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:35.200]  not recession Bob Chapman great to have you here in the new year sir well thank
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:39.560]  you very much Alex it's great to be back again in the little hiatus this week
[1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:48.280]  and first of all that is a very important and unusual statement to be
[1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:53.280]  coming from the economist I can't quite figure out what they're after here
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:58.360]  they're telling the truth which is not normal for them because that publication
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:03.800]  is alumnus controlled and so there has to be another agenda here maybe they're
[1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:10.240]  preparing everybody for a depression maybe they want them to know that in
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:14.920]  fact that's where we're headed and and they want to maintain their moral
[1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:18.520]  they want to maintain their moral authority as if they told us as if they
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:23.520]  weren't working for the very system that engineered it yes that would give them
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:30.480]  validity in something that was very well known among people who listen to your
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:36.200]  program and programs like it and but the rest of the public doesn't know so
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:42.280]  they're going to tell them and of course that's justification to for the massive
[1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:50.040]  layoffs the cutbacks in state services which are being thrust upon them by
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:56.720]  inadequate preparation being led down the garden path investment wise of the
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:02.800]  freezing up of the municipal bond market the over hiring and overspending that's
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:08.680]  been going on in states for a long time and and in all of the things that come
[1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:15.880]  part and parcel with the downfall of the economy and and that leads us to you know
[1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:20.680]  where we headed and we have a new president if in fact he takes office
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:26.800]  which he probably will whether he's a citizen or not and the plan is for a
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:34.240]  trillion dollars for domestic stimulus in another number of different areas and
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:39.360]  that'll be select payoffs to certain members of the establishment of
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:44.360]  different divisions the economy so they play ball exactly and of course the
[1:13:44.360 --> 1:13:49.720]  drug and medical profession will be taken well care of with a hundred billion
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:55.440]  dollars extension into Medicaid of which is 50 million people on right now and
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:14:04.720]  with the layoffs come the losing of company benefits whether you're in your
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:10.000]  health insurance is paid for the buy the company by you and the company or just by
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:14.840]  you the fact that you've fallen out of the group means you don't have it any
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:21.240]  more and then you've got a visit Medicaid so it's a domino yes the figure
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:26.120]  could go to 60 or 70 million people pretty easily because you get children
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:33.120]  involved etc not just the employee and so that is part of the stimulus package
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:41.720]  and as you say the stimuli will use the Latin word for that the stimuli will in
[1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:50.680]  fact go to or the largest will go to the anointed people within the elitist
[1:14:50.680 --> 1:14:56.240]  system to further centralize the entire control grid why do we have the prime
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:59.960]  minister of Canada coming out and saying depression why don't we have seen a lot
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:06.120]  of elite spokesman and publications now saying depression and we go back to 10
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:10.960]  weeks ago when the tens of trillions of theft began I say tens of trillions the
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:14.600]  last numbers 8.5 trillion three weeks ago they've been keeping it secret since
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:18.360]  then but was a trillion 300 billion a week so it's I guess it's up to 1112
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:21.720]  trillion of the trends continuing well I guess we'll find out sometime in the
[1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:25.520]  future what the shadow banking government's doing the news is openly
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:29.360]  admitting it's a Wall Street coup mainline analysts are admitting that
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:34.560]  foreign offshore banks are taking over we have and I want your take on this
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:40.680]  Bob your analysis here we have all of this unfolding and we had them 11 ten
[1:15:40.680 --> 1:15:43.200]  and a half weeks ago saying if you don't do this bailout we're gonna have a
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:46.720]  depression and that was finally what really sent the economy down and
[1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:51.240]  destroyed confidence so it I mean right there they were engaging in financial
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:58.200]  terrorism which which it appears is is is accelerating the downfall well I
[1:15:58.200 --> 1:16:06.000]  think it would you you have here is a a haggling approach and that is the two
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:13.600]  steps forward one step back etc and the two steps forward of course is the on
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:20.440]  rushing depression and the one step back would be the stimulus which is not
[1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:26.440]  only coming soon from the new administration but also the stimulus
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:32.720]  that's been involved in the figures I put out three months ago of over ten
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:37.600]  trillion dollars when everybody was talking about 50 billion and I raised
[1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:44.320]  my figure 12 to 13 and now it's over 20 I mean we don't know where it's going
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:49.160]  and they're just going to throw money at anything and that money in the form of
[1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:53.440]  monetization which means it'll get into the system and be inflationary will start
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:59.840]  hitting probably in March April May and I expect there'll be some kind of a rally
[1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:04.400]  in the market because of the anticipation of the stimulus package
[1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:09.800]  which is really peanuts compared to what's being spent or created otherwise
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:16.600]  and I think this coming year will be a giant year for gold and silver
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:21.680]  commodities will recover inflation will be rampant and toward the end of the
[1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:26.400]  year perhaps as early as May or June we'll see a turn down on the market
[1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:35.880]  again and I think that the lows of just recent time which are on 7400 and back
[1:17:35.880 --> 1:17:44.000]  in two 003 was 72 68 I think that'll be broken I don't know anything they can
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:49.880]  hold a system down Bob on record you did say a month or so ago when it was down
[1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:54.920]  there at 7000 that it was gonna go back up to 9 and then you predicted going
[1:17:54.920 --> 1:17:59.960]  from memory that it's going to then go down to four correct it could and in
[1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:03.760]  stages but but I mean you have been saying for several months that you see
[1:18:03.760 --> 1:18:08.440]  it that's right in March of next year even rallying more but then we'll find
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:12.000]  out when you believe it's gonna implode and then how you're coming up with a
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:16.880]  $20 billion number stay with us or 20 trillion excuse me the headlines are

[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:38.640]  private Federal Reserve and they would not tell anyone where it went
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.880]  lawsuits were filed by Bloomberg and the feds said no one will be told not even
[1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:49.720]  Congress as if Congress isn't above the executive yeah it's not equal powers you
[1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:53.240]  really study the founding of this nation and even state laws and
[1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:58.440]  legislatures they create the courts they are above the courts the executive is
[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:07.920]  the weakest but side issue for three plus weeks we've got no new numbers that I
[1:23:07.920 --> 1:23:11.760]  know of Bob Chapman only focuses really on the financial and read scores of
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:15.640]  publications a day Bob you're always conservative where do you come up with
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:20.640]  the number that 20 trillion has been stolen or I'm I mean projecting from
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:25.440]  what it was 1 trillion 300 billion a week that would have us at about 11 and a
[1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:29.200]  half to 12 trillion right now are you saying you think it'll go to 20 trillion
[1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:34.840]  or are you saying you believe it's already at 20 trillion no I think you
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:44.760]  right now is projected presently at 12 to 13 and and it could go over 20 very
[1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:53.280]  easily they have to continue to create money and credit and I suspect what
[1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:57.880]  they're doing is if they're they're creating treasury bills they're not
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:24:03.840]  selling them in the marketplace I think that they're using them as collateral
[1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:07.760]  for companies and those are the words they give well they said that they will
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:15.000]  they said that they're leveraging it well yeah but in what way that I haven't
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:19.160]  seen an explanation as to how they're doing now they're secretive but I mean
[1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:22.640]  I mean you saw the New York Times two weeks ago where they said oh by the way
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:26.240]  the Fed's gonna issue its own secret bonds that have the same value as
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:32.080]  treasury yes and I suspect that they've gone ahead and done that before they
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:36.920]  even announced it and so the amount of money that it that is out there in the
[1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:43.960]  form of treasuries and loans and the acceptance of rotten collateralization
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:52.080]  and the creation of money is far beyond what we know the the estimates I've
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:57.080]  gave given you a conservative when I said 10 trillion everybody laughed and it
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:02.520]  was 50 or so billion and of course we're up there already and they're fighting
[1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:07.400]  an underlying deflation and they've been doing that for over five years and most
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:14.200]  of the impetus has been done for solving that problem suppressing the
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:19.200]  deflationary aspects of the economy by increasing money and credit now they've
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:24.000]  lowered the interest rates down to virtually zero to throw in a helping
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:31.480]  hand of course that situation is terminal because they can't go any lower
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:37.360]  and so now they really got to create a lot more paper and they're going to do
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:45.120]  that until the system says to the lender who supposedly is keeping the system
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:51.800]  floating if you may that we're not going to borrow anymore we're just not going
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:56.840]  to do it okay mom that happens it'll collapse now Bob I got two questions
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:00.720]  from all the evidence I've seen and then the inside Boulderburg info and they're
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:03.680]  even their public statements you know the Financial Times admitting two years
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:08.800]  ago that they were going to use this to consolidate power it is engineered and
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:13.240]  and and they've still shut down a liquidity and loans and credit to the
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:17.000]  public and Main Street and it appears they're only massing it into themselves
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:21.400]  while it still has some fiat value with people's perception buying up real
[1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:27.040]  assets and literally war chesting for war physically with classic tyranny and
[1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:32.440]  so they're just buying time to get their system in place so a do you agree that
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:38.880]  they've engineered it or you're saying that they lost control and then B you've
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:45.440]  been saying two to three years of the last year are you revising it saying it
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:52.000]  looks like it's accelerating no I don't think it's accelerating and they're
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:57.240]  still in the same mode trying to do the same thing they originally engineered it
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:03.200]  it did get out of their control because I don't think that they thought they
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:09.560]  would not be able to get rid of all of the CDOs and SIVs they have which are
[1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:16.880]  bonds containing mortgages that's really what they get stuck with and they had
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:22.680]  sold a lot of it most of it in Europe and they get stuck with it and at the
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:29.920]  same time the loans which are within that structure of those bonds have gone
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:35.880]  down in value because you know our average person has a value in his home
[1:27:35.880 --> 1:27:44.520]  250,000 and those 310 but a lot of people you know millions a month are
[1:27:44.520 --> 1:27:48.520]  losing their jobs are getting pay cuts I mean it's a depression for a lot of
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:54.720]  people out there let's come back and talk about how you see this unfolding then
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:58.360]  we're gonna go to phone calls from Gary Matt Barry Brian Kim and others we're

[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:25.960]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water that's because many
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:29.480]  chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the

[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:46.320]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:51.280]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the

[1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:43.480]  folks with their atmospheric water generators it just looks like a water
[1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:48.440]  cooler without the water bottle on top grabs it out of the air and the
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:52.200]  condensates seven and a half gallons a day even the driest climates it gives
[1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:56.160]  you over three gallons a day with their smaller units they have big ones and they
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:33:59.640]  have solar power systems you name it also on the site a colablue.com
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:06.360]  ECOLOblue.com and then after it grabs it out of the air it goes through an
[1:34:06.360 --> 1:34:09.360]  activated carbon filter a silver impregnated carbon filter reverse
[1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:13.080]  osmosis system the taste and color odor removal filter and it's stored in the

[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:24.600]  colablue.com okay let's go back to Bob Chapman Bob I got a lot of questions here
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:31.680]  and I know the listeners do as well how do you see I mean I ask you this every
[1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:34.960]  week when you're on but you know you always give us different nuanced answers
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:39.880]  how do you I mean I see it accelerating I mean this is I mean I know you didn't
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:42.600]  expect to see them all over TV saying we're going into a depression and now
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:49.640]  have the economist out saying that but I guess as bad as it is now you're saying
[1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:54.080]  in the next two years it's just going to intensify what will it physically look
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:34:59.120]  like on the streets and then that's a B and we're going to calls how will this
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:04.320]  equation work this isn't some Soviet revolution Bolshevik revolution where
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:07.920]  the people are disarmed in the in the dirtbag parasites can have their way
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:11.720]  this isn't some Nazi revolution where they're disarmed can have their way this
[1:35:11.720 --> 1:35:16.680]  isn't some malice revolution where the people are disarmed I mean you've got a
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:21.360]  hundred and forty million gun owners and higher than that just and millions of
[1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:25.000]  them want to start shooting I don't want that to happen folks but the globalists
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:31.080]  are going to push how is that going to work I mean I see this just and they've
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:33.800]  got the cops all hyped up and out of their minds you know thinking they're
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:37.320]  doing a good job bringing in tyranny revenue generating off the public that
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:41.760]  can't pay anymore so so a how's this going to unfold and be how do you see it
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:48.360]  starting and blowing up or or or not well the the major impetus will be
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:53.560]  unemployment and those figures are much higher than what we're being given and
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:36:00.040]  as we go into this year the stimulus package which they will get and as soon
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:06.960]  as put before Congress probably in late January that'll start to go into gear
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:13.320]  probably in March and April and that'll put things off for six months maybe as
[1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:20.440]  long as a year often the respect that those who have laid off will go to work
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:24.480]  for the federal government one former another either through one of the
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:30.440]  corporations it's dealing in the payoff to them from the federal government or
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:34.600]  the federal government itself but once that running money runs out the only
[1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:40.840]  alternative they have is to create another trillion dollars to do it again
[1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:47.240]  because it's not working and I think at that stage sometime later this year you're
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:54.880]  going to start to see demonstrations which I think could become violent
[1:36:55.240 --> 1:37:01.760]  please continue breaking that down what's the next step after that well the
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:07.640]  next step after that is the things that you talk about so well and that is the
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:13.240]  police acting in behalf of the federal government not your local police force
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.640]  not your state police force or your county the orders will come down this is
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:21.840]  what you're going to do and you're going to go out and pick up this list of
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:29.040]  people and I think that will be it be the beginning it'll start off with the
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:33.080]  threatening and if you don't keep your mouth shut and stop doing what you're
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:37.200]  doing we're going to come and and bring charges against you because you're a
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:43.200]  borderline terrorist and of course those who don't shut up will either have to
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:49.640]  hide and and do what they do under the cover of darkness or they'll go to an
[1:37:49.640 --> 1:37:54.160]  internment camp and that's how the thing will involve and once that starts to
[1:37:54.160 --> 1:37:58.960]  happen there'll be a certain segment of the population who will shut up
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:04.000]  and take orders and do as they're told what that segment will be it'll probably
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:09.440]  be half of them and the other half will become more aggressive perhaps in
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:13.760]  challenging government if there's not enough food to go around or places to
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:18.600]  live in I think people are going to start doing what is normally considered
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:23.760]  criminal activity and that would be going and taking food and and in other
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:31.440]  things from companies and government as well but that's the next issue again
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:36.600]  proving this was premeditated not just two and a half years ago getting the
[1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:39.720]  intel out of Bilderberg that they were going to implode the subprime mortgage
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:44.280]  by design to cause a global currency crisis that they would then come in and
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:48.600]  offer the world government as the solution that now is happening openly
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:52.160]  announcing world government will save you when the very same banking families
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:56.840]  have engineered this and building the FEMA camps the last seven years now
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:00.880]  announcing the army war college coming out and saying yes we are prepared to
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:04.840]  engage the American people they're not even saying it's for al-Qaeda anymore
[1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:08.000]  they're having to admit to the troops okay get ready to go up against the
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.680]  people though they still put out another brand of propaganda you know on time
[1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:15.600]  square and big events oh look the troops are here to protect you from al-Qaeda but
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:19.760]  but but to their own people and in the newspaper I mean I have an article here
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:25.400]  out of mainstream news where they're calling for troops on the streets and
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:31.840]  you know saying how great all this is out of the albuquerque newspaper so again
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:36.800]  my point is they they clearly have been preparing for this for decades is that
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:40.000]  they knew their Ponzi scheme would implode and they would offer the new
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:47.280]  solution of even greater power I mean any way you cut it they engineered this
[1:39:47.280 --> 1:39:53.200]  well that's true and you know all along the way you can never tell how things
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:59.840]  are gonna go that's why you know the answer is relatively nebulous as you
[1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:06.280]  go along you know three months from now we can have people doing the kind of
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:11.520]  things I just described or it may take a year and a quarter we just don't know I
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:16.760]  mean we know there's gonna be problems we know they could get violent we know
[1:40:16.760 --> 1:40:21.920]  they probably will get violent and and they may become a revolution well let's
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:28.960]  say they try to go pick up 10,000 people in a first wave you know under the
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:32.560]  cover of food riots and and write down a society people say do whatever you have
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:41.640]  to just give us give us our football games again if you have 1% of 10,000
[1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:46.160]  fight back you know that's hundreds of people fighting back if they try to I
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:49.560]  mean and no doubt hundreds of thousands are gonna conservatively fight back by
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:55.400]  the time this is over I mean the second amendment comes into the equation Bob I
[1:40:55.400 --> 1:41:01.560]  mean I don't see any way that the establishment can win this thing well I
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:06.720]  don't either and they will do it on to the cover of law and that means in in
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:10.680]  order to defend yourself and not be dragged off then you're going to have
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:14.320]  to break the law whatever that law is and the law will be what they whatever
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:21.360]  they say it is and so what it's going to come to is the people who have spoken
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:28.120]  out against things within government and business they will try to collect them
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:31.880]  and the shooting will start
[1:41:34.160 --> 1:41:39.320]  you know it's interesting too and we always talk about America but you know
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:44.360]  this is going to happen worldwide and I've lived in a lot of countries and I
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:48.720]  speak several languages and I got to tell you something in all of those
[1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:55.000]  countries particularly in Latin America the people are fairly well armed in
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:00.800]  those countries too and I think this time around if this sort of thing is
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:07.200]  trying to be enforced upon them they're going to shoot back too well that's why
[1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:11.520]  the United States is giving now over a hundred billion a year to Mexico to get
[1:42:11.520 --> 1:42:15.600]  rid of the old-fashioned potbelly corrupt cops and have the paramilitary black
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:19.520]  uniform guys everywhere but that's not going to work either when they go home
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:23.820]  and their own family shoots them that's true and you know that they're
[1:42:23.820 --> 1:42:28.480]  parading them through the streets on trucks daily in major cities throughout
[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:36.600]  Latin America because of this threat of NACO Traficante inspired the violence
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:42.600]  and they're wearing the balaclavas and in the whole works there they get M60s
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:52.120]  mounted on trucks and it's bizarre and also a good part of the deaths that you
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:57.760]  see in places like Mexico are caused by the military wantonly just shooting
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:03.640]  people because they think that they're bad people are suspected so and there's a
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:08.240]  lot of stories to that effect so these things are happening elsewhere as well
[1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:14.720]  and the people are not happy about it lawless criminals have taken control of
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:19.080]  the society worldwide and as the crisis deepens they act more like greedy
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:24.040]  roaches just grabbing everything that is nailed down they've already grabbed
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:27.960]  everything that wasn't nailed down and it's kind of an orgy of corruption right
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:32.240]  here at the end and you know I talked about it last week earlier this week I'm
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:36.760]  seeing Austin police now racing around without their lights on running up
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:40.320]  behind citizens when there's open lanes for them to go around and then just
[1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:43.280]  violently acting like they're going to run them off the road and police
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:47.560]  everywhere just just just radar gunning and and and and riding tickets and
[1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:51.920]  feeding and and acting all wild-eyed because their bosses are getting them
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:55.760]  ready to engage the people they're telling them you know have bad behavior
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:44:00.960]  go out be arrogant act however you want in preparation for what's coming in the
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:06.200]  future I don't think these guys realize they're entering a hell pit yeah they
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:13.160]  don't they just don't know and I I have an nephew who just resigned at 50 years
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:18.760]  old assistant chief of police in a fairly major city because he knows what's
[1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:29.760]  coming he resigned huh mm-hmm well he had 30 years in what was the last straw
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:35.000]  that that was hard to get from him but I think this was it the federalization of
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:43.440]  the police department and and also the person who was appointed above him was
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:47.280]  semi-competent and he was tired of putting up with it but how are they
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:54.440]  getting the police to to in front of other cop cars run up on people's hind
[1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:58.620]  ends almost hitting them and then violently they pull around you and
[1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:01.360]  then actually they're gonna run into your car shine spotlights in your eyes
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:04.400]  but I'm seeing them do it to other people not just me you know this happened
[1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:08.720]  to myself a few days ago going home and I'm seeing I mean it's like they've
[1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:14.480]  gone crazy well that's the power that comes you know from the federal government
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:20.320]  and that's what makes them act that way and of course you know you you have an
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:26.640]  ad here on how to make your license plate a list invisible so that they can't
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:31.760]  with their cameras give you a ticket well this is a massive massive money
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:38.880]  raising effort tickets have always been that way I know most large cities and
[1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:45.120]  states look to their highway patrol will call them to bring in 40 tickets a month
[1:45:45.120 --> 1:45:51.760]  now maybe the quote is 60 but that goes along with the aggressiveness and they
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:55.800]  just waiting for you to say something so you they can throw you in jail and give
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:46:04.120]  you a larger fine of several thousand dollars it's all about money don't they
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:08.160]  understand that the people that control the United States are anti-freedom
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:13.160]  anti-us and there's been a private corporate takeover of the society no
[1:46:13.160 --> 1:46:21.440]  15% of the police people know that the other 85% do not know do they care and
[1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:26.600]  in fact in many states they're hiring people who have had criminal records oh
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:35.040]  I know a policeman and in so you know where do you go you know you if there is
[1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:40.360]  bad as the average person the 50% of America who just doesn't get it and
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:45.200]  probably never will now you're right the public itself a large segment is just
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:49.880]  wicked degenerate but also delusional when they try to screw you or cheat you
[1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:53.760]  or do something bad they'll make up a lie why they did it and why you deserve it
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:59.360]  and they think because they made it up that I mean it's it's mass mental
[1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:03.440]  illness Bob do you get the point I'm making it it's like crazy I spent a
[1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:07.080]  lot of time with Lauren for some because my wife and I were professional
[1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:12.000]  shooters and we used to use their facilities very often so we got to know
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:16.800]  them very very well and we know all the police signals and things like that many
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:25.200]  years ago and the comment that always sticks with me is that well we're sure
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:31.440]  that they broke the law sometimes during their lifetime so it was justifiable
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:35.160]  that we picked them up for whatever we picked them up for whether it was a
[1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:40.520]  ticket or disorderly conduct or whatever it was there's always some kind of a
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:45.920]  justification in their mind for executing the law there's no even
[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:51.640]  handedness and it's the same thing in Washington today there are no laws there
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:56.600]  are they are whatever we say they are and then it grows at some same mentality
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:01.160]  and law enforcement unfortunately and then it grows into we've got to break
[1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:05.160]  the law to beat the bad guys and then one morning they wake up they are the
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:10.160]  bad guys well we were taught that when I went to work encounter intelligent I
[1:48:10.160 --> 1:48:15.880]  mean you know whatever goes whatever you got to do you do it well I have a a
[1:48:15.880 --> 1:48:23.880]  older family member I'll just say this who was a Army officer and he'd been in
[1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:28.040]  I don't like 15 years been in Europe in places and then the CIA came and
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:31.640]  recruited him and said you're gonna be a field operative and they said the first
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:35.440]  thing you're gonna go do and he won't tell much more of the story like he told
[1:48:35.440 --> 1:48:40.640]  to my dad he wouldn't even tell me the story and he sent him to Chicago to
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:45.640]  basically deal drugs and do other things and then he said it was so criminal
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:50.600]  you couldn't believe it and then he said no but I mean they're recruiting they've
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:57.200]  recruited millions of people I know they did I was there they didn't recruit me
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:01.320]  though all right let's hold you five after into the next hour because I want

[1:52:25.920 --> 1:52:38.720]  we are back live let's go ahead and take a call from Gary in Illinois Gary you're
[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:47.760]  on the air go ahead Gary you're on the air good sir go ahead
[1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:51.520]  yeah just had a question for Bob and then just I wanted to bring two things to
[1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:56.360]  your attention I could ask Bob I was just wondering what I wanted to get into
[1:52:56.360 --> 1:53:02.080]  gold obviously is not now's the time on the punch between I mean I know some of
[1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:06.960]  the claims like your your eagles and your sovereigns are point you know 917
[1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:10.560]  pure and then your your maples are 0.99 what's the difference I mean you're
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:16.440]  getting a better deal with a certain coin because it has more purity no they're
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:21.500]  all sold on the basis of what they have in them and that's all reflected in
[1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:28.120]  price so all things are equal more or less from coin to coin because a fifth
[1:53:28.120 --> 1:53:34.960]  ounce cost less than a quarter ounce and so you buy billion coins you get
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:40.320]  billion coins and the markets the markups are generally the same the markups
[1:53:40.320 --> 1:53:43.960]  nowadays have changed their larger because more and more people throughout
[1:53:43.960 --> 1:53:51.040]  the world are buying coins so you know you call might as at 877-479-8479
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:59.720]  8178 that's 877-479-8178 and they'll fill you in on the details of that
[1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:03.720]  thanks for the plug for the for the minister let me let me simplify it
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:11.800]  you'll have a Kruger in that that you'll say one ounce but there's an ounce of
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:17.000]  gold but it's actually above an ounce because they add some alloy in there so
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:22.200]  that it's not soft and and you know doesn't basically deform in circulation
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:28.360]  whereas some mints will put out take a Mexican coins my Mexican gold they tend
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:31.560]  to be way above an ounce say if it's a one ounce gold coin there's an ounce of
[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:37.240]  gold in there but they even put more alloy in and so so when you get into
[1:54:37.240 --> 1:54:42.600]  gold percentages if it says a fifth of an ounce it may be above a fifth of an
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:46.560]  ounce but there's a fifth of an ounce of gold in there and then whatever above
[1:54:46.560 --> 1:54:52.480]  it is in the alloy correct Bob that's correct and that's again all reflected
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:58.880]  in the prices they they do it by grams and so you know we they're all the same
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:05.520]  although some coins have a billion coins have larger premiums and others and you
[1:55:05.520 --> 1:55:09.480]  have to talk to might it's about that and they'll tell you the differences and
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:15.240]  what the best perspective buy is for that day absolutely you know that
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:21.320]  offer that Ted gave here on air Wednesday of gold price in at 770 when it
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:26.600]  was seven when it was 880 as it is today that deal is still holding by the way
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:34.520]  throughout the weekend Ted told me so again 800 686 2237 on that main deal
[1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:38.640]  that the number Bob gave you can also call and get a free hard copy of the

[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:41.640]  they are a paramilitary force and they're helping the bankers destroy their
[1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:45.680]  society they have incrementally warped and twisted the police of the dark side

[1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:24.160]  calls from Matt in the UK Barry in California Brian in Canada Kim in Texas
[1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:30.040]  and others then I'm gonna get into all the hubbub about does Barack Obama want
[1:59:30.040 --> 1:59:35.760]  your guns the answer is he's voted for an absolute complete gun ban when he was a
[1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:40.880]  state senator in Illinois and when he was a US senator he supported of course
[1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:46.200]  the absolute gun ban in DC and he calls that reasonable and so he is the most
[1:59:46.200 --> 1:59:50.680]  anti-gun member of the Senate and we're gonna play some clips of Joe Biden and
[1:59:50.680 --> 1:59:54.520]  others and their sickening statements coming up later in this hour but right
[1:59:54.520 --> 2:00:00.160]  now with Bob Chapman let's go ahead and go back to the calls Matt in the United
[2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:04.440]  Kingdom you're on the year welcome good afternoon good evening sir and happy
[2:00:04.440 --> 2:00:09.880]  year gloomy new year from the UK and hello Bob yeah my question is it's a
[2:00:09.880 --> 2:00:14.760]  Bob you mentioned obviously about high unemployment obviously in the US I don't
[2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:18.920]  know if you've obviously read the news on Alex's website basically we just lost
[2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:24.320]  like 25,000 people from the Woolies Woolworth's group I don't know if they've
[2:00:24.320 --> 2:00:29.240]  got any in the in the US and what what what do you reckon will happen in the
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:32.960]  UK do you reckon that they'll put out UK troops when the people start to
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:36.280]  realize and riot let me answer that and then have Bob answer it because I don't
[2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:39.840]  want to forget this point they have announced in your major newspapers that
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:44.400]  they do have the the British military ready for civil insurrection with the
[2:00:44.400 --> 2:00:47.560]  police and the police have been drilling with your military quietly for
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:52.000]  decades now publicly that's been on British TV and in the British newspaper
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:56.560]  yes Woolworth's is the international department store chain Bob Chapman your
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:01:03.440]  comment as you've said this has been going on for a long time the cordon is
[2:01:03.440 --> 2:01:10.120]  getting tighter and tighter in the UK unemployment is going up the pound is
[2:01:10.120 --> 2:01:17.200]  under tremendous stress from failures in the banking system I think it's going
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:23.160]  to get considerably worse we cover the England and other countries in the
[2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:28.240]  international forecaster very thoroughly and so we have a lot of up-to-date news
[2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:32.920]  and we get letters from people saying the G I live in England I didn't know that
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:39.640]  which makes me feel good but England is really in for trouble and they have no
[2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:47.720]  weapons they can't fight back some of these goofs even want to keep you from
[2:01:47.720 --> 2:01:52.320]  carrying a penknife in your pocket because they say the criminals are now
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:56.280]  you know every week I see a story where people break in they're raping they're
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:01.080]  killing and if somebody pushes a thief out a window or breaks a vase over their
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:05.120]  head the police viciously charge them and send them to prison I mean what a
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:08.560]  predatory government where you can't defend yourself the police can't and
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:13.600]  won't defend yourself and they get very upset of a slave even fist fights back
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:17.360]  they want the message you're not allowed to defend yourself and it's an island
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:22.920]  country look at the globalist what they just did to Iceland British banks owned
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:26.440]  their private central bank and just won't give the people their own deposits
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:29.880]  and the people been rioting successfully there against the private
[2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:35.120]  Federal Reserve system now that's true and if I was living in England I would
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:40.560]  emigrate yeah I think island nations that don't have a lot of good
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:47.040]  agriculture because of their northern clines it is one of the worst places to
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:52.480]  live is it not Bob absolutely you get too many things working against you and
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:56.960]  you have a giant immigrant population that's been filled with the by the
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:00.680]  establishment with hatred of England so they can use the immigrant population as
[2:03:00.680 --> 2:03:05.920]  a weapon against the indigenous people of Britannia all right does that answer
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:14.560]  your question Brian or yeah I'm happy to hear to you start giving that news stay
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:19.280]  with us hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:22.680]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:26.520]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:29.840]  a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[2:03:29.840 --> 2:03:33.680]  dough and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:37.200]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:40.840]  for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:45.160]  off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:49.200]  out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:52.960]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:57.000]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:04:01.200]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:05.440]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:09.200]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:12.920]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:04:12.920 --> 2:04:16.520]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:20.680]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[2:04:20.680 --> 2:04:24.200]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[2:04:24.200 --> 2:04:28.040]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:32.200]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:35.200]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:38.400]  having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:42.040]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:45.680]  and preparedness no one is gonna take care of your family in the final
[2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:49.080]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:51.600]  all right folks we're live at prison planet dot TV on the January 2nd 2009
[2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:56.280]  edition Bob Chapman with us for the rest of this segment I want to go to Barry
[2:05:56.280 --> 2:06:02.880]  Brian Kim Scott Ronnie James and others right now then I'm gonna get into a
[2:06:02.880 --> 2:06:07.040]  bunch of other news we haven't detailed yet and the situation we face with the
[2:06:07.040 --> 2:06:10.320]  disarmament of the American people that's what the military has been quietly
[2:06:10.320 --> 2:06:14.200]  trained for for decades and we're now hurtling towards that eventuality but
[2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:18.240]  thank God the people have now discovered this have now found out about it they
[2:06:18.240 --> 2:06:22.760]  know about Barack Obama's voting record and they are waking up and buying
[2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:27.240]  firearms and ammunition and drugs the gun culture is being revived like the
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:32.480]  phoenix out of the ashes and I think of you have courage out there and get the
[2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:37.040]  word out and the police and military at least portions of them stick with the
[2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:41.120]  people we may be able to avert this but regardless we're going into the future
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:48.320]  and it is going to be a rocky time let's go ahead and go back to the calls
[2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:54.180]  let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Canada Brian you were on the air hi
[2:06:54.180 --> 2:06:59.240]  Alex hello how are you happy new year happy new year doing a pretty good under
[2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:03.040]  dictator Harper here all things considered that's right for those that
[2:07:03.040 --> 2:07:08.000]  don't know not only are scores of towns in the United States under 24-hour
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:13.840]  curfew for the citizens from Arkansas to Oklahoma to areas in Kentucky we played
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:18.400]  a clip of that on Wednesday for people that didn't believe it from CNN up in
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:23.080]  Canada for now a month the Queen has declared basically political martial
[2:07:23.080 --> 2:07:27.760]  law Reuters reported that she basically secretly ran the country and that when
[2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:33.040]  Parliament was getting ready to kick Harper out she just she just came in
[2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:38.040]  and trump them all with her ace of spades go ahead well I know that me for
[2:07:38.040 --> 2:07:42.160]  myself I made the personal decision to parole all my bills and obligations
[2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:46.560]  until the end of January what the heck you know I'd like to make some
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:50.840]  predictions on the coming year I noticed going out and trying to procure myself
[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:55.600]  some DVDs and books that up here in Canada looks like there's some censorship
[2:07:55.600 --> 2:08:00.640]  going on I had at least two video stores specified to me that they had a phone
[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:05.600]  call where they were requested to have endgame your video Alex sent back so I
[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:08.920]  know that things are being taken off the shelf they're trying to put us back to
[2:08:08.920 --> 2:08:13.360]  sleep I know I can let all the info warriors making comments on the internet
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:18.280]  know that they'll continue to be harassed they'll continue to block you and
[2:08:18.280 --> 2:08:21.640]  they'll continue to actually try and copy us like somebody tried to do to me
[2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:26.400]  this year I caught him with my French so I enjoyed that one quite a bit but it's
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:30.840]  that kind of gave me a kind of inspiration to when they come on with
[2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:34.320]  their comments and say well and all of yous are goofy idiots and none of this
[2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:37.680]  matters well if it didn't matter you wouldn't have to go and find some
[2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:43.640]  Frenchman to try and imitate me well I appreciate I appreciate your call let me
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:49.440]  break that down the hardest place for us in the world not Japan not Australia not
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:55.000]  Germany not Russia not Mexico my videos ship out to all those places no
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:01.800]  problem UPS FedEx we've jumped through all these hoops we mail our stuff in
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:05.720]  bulk so they can so it can go through customs in Canada they'll break it they'll
[2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:09.960]  smash it they'll mail it back to us I've gone through Canadian customs they knew
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:14.280]  exactly who I was interrogated me for 15 hours screaming at me telling me I was
[2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:20.200]  evil and yes the Canadians have no idea how controlled their society is Bob
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:26.480]  Chapman the last time I was in Canada I was held for four hours and went through
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:35.240]  the same crap that you did and I will never return to that country they love
[2:09:35.240 --> 2:09:40.480]  it I mean I mean it's like being when you see some film of me about 1984 the way
[2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:44.400]  secret police act just laughing at you I've got you and I'm sending you to
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:49.120]  prison you piece of bleeping garbage and they're just like and they just
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:52.360]  revel in their black uniforms just laughing at you in your cornered in
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:57.800]  there I mean you just can't imagine it's gonna be like that here in the US it is
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:06.200]  so sad Bob it certainly is and you know there was no reason for it they just do
[2:10:06.200 --> 2:10:15.480]  what they want to do you're on the list and they take a particular relish and
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:21.240]  and and working on me because I used to work for the government and I had a
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:26.120]  very responsible position yours is different you're more outspoken and
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:31.240]  more circulated than I am but they don't forget anywhere I go in the world I
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:36.360]  put up with the same thing this is the global government absolutely amazing
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:40.240]  and again the Canadian people are great folks that's why this evil's been able
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:47.720]  to grow because they're naive they don't know what's happened hmm how does the
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:52.360]  government find this type of scum who just enjoys abusing people and treating
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:58.800]  good people like crap I don't know but obviously they have no trouble doing so
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:03.280]  I think a lot of them believe in what they're doing but they don't understand
[2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:07.640]  what the problem is and when you try to discuss it with them without which I'm
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:13.600]  sure you did they said you know we just do what we have to do what we're told
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:17.600]  to do they don't even say that they scream they scream and laugh and say
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:21.760]  shut up and then demand you answer a question when you do they scream and
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:25.440]  say I said shut up and then they say you're going to one of our prisons we
[2:11:25.440 --> 2:11:29.600]  can't wait you know do you know what we do to you in our prisons and they and
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:33.720]  they just love the evil they love hurting freedom they love and I know why
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:39.640]  in game we know that google.ca for most people it says unavailable now also in
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:44.160]  France most my videos are unavailable you still got to go to google.com to get
[2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:48.720]  to the US servers a lot of those are blocked worldwide in game covers the
[2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:52.760]  fact that they basically kidnap me for 15 hours until international media found
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:56.800]  out and so the film starts with them kidnapping me and so I guess that's why
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:02.640]  they don't want to end game up in Canada in all probability well the answer is
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:06.320]  folks get in game smuggle it into whatever you have to and then make
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:10.720]  thousands of copies and give it to your whole neighborhood don't let them stop
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:15.120]  you and let let folks know this is a suppressed video you know I mean use
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:18.640]  that against them the fact that it is suppressed that it is banned that they
[2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:23.040]  don't want you to have it you know we still ship to Canada but it but we lose
[2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:26.320]  money on it because most of the packages don't make it I want listeners in
[2:12:26.320 --> 2:12:31.640]  Canada to know that and we've done tests we we've mailed the films from other
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:35.520]  locations with another business name no problem they go straight through
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:40.840]  everything we do is flagged and so you know we even have a subsidiary company
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:45.360]  will change the name to that try to get through but but and then Canadians can't
[2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:48.360]  believe they're living in a country where it's so censored let's go ahead and
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:52.680]  talk to Kim in Texas Kim you're on the air with Bob Chapman
[2:12:53.600 --> 2:13:00.200]  Kim you must be listening to the radio oh no I'm here I'm here I'm sorry yes hi
[2:13:00.200 --> 2:13:06.640]  Alex hi Bob yes I'm calling you up Houston and I have a question my husband's
[2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:12.840]  a truck driver and we've been you know affected in a lot of ways you know we
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:17.600]  have our good months and then we have most of the time is bad months and I was
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:24.160]  just wondering where do you see that industry you know heading right down the
[2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:33.880]  toilet about yeah about set over 70% of what we use in America is goes by trucks
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:41.080]  on the road and as the economy slows down you know less the trucking will
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:48.760]  need to be used to transport goods and so I I see it in a recession and
[2:13:48.760 --> 2:13:54.360]  eventually like the remainder of the economy in depression simply because of
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:14:01.280]  the reduction in the shipment of goods yes and on top of that they sold and I
[2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:04.080]  appreciate your call Kim I'm getting the feedback so I'm gonna let you go they
[2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:10.280]  sold the truck driving industry first on putting transponders in the companies
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:13.880]  tracking their trucks now a lot of states are trying to pressure companies and the
[2:14:13.880 --> 2:14:18.120]  feds to put that in as part of trusted trader trusted traveler especially if
[2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:23.000]  you go to these international commerce points that they built these inland
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:27.960]  ports and others now what's happening is that the the state police are getting
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:32.800]  federal databases where they pick on the smaller firms and leave the big firms
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:37.040]  alone and the police aren't even told this it's just in the database and so
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:40.560]  they're gonna have subsidies for the big companies and they're gonna bankrupt
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:43.920]  most the small ones so again that's what this command and control economy is
[2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:49.080]  about destroying it by design and only allowing certain sectors of industries to
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:55.960]  survive Bob I agree with that and that's a part of what I call the corporate as
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:15:01.400]  fascist state the concentration of industry in the hands of the Illuminati
[2:15:01.400 --> 2:15:06.080]  in every sphere and this is what they're after and of course during that
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:10.800]  process they'll get rid of the small businesses as as quickly and as
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:15.640]  efficiently as they can this is the control you see Walmart is the share
[2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:20.680]  cropper company store and that's why as the economy goes down they become more
[2:15:20.680 --> 2:15:25.120]  wealthy because again they're not competing fairly they have slave labor
[2:15:25.120 --> 2:15:29.920]  and slave goods and Chinese currencies devalued so no one can compete they have
[2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:34.640]  strategic deals with the infrastructure there so no one can compete with it and
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:37.640]  so that's why their profits are way up and everything else is in the toilet
[2:15:37.640 --> 2:15:41.040]  then everything else goes bankrupt and all you have left is Walmart that's why
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:44.680]  they're part of the national security infrastructure that's why they're part
[2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:48.440]  of the infrastructure protection system and that's why Walmart does the drills
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:52.040]  of force inoculations the roundup drills which they we told you about a
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:57.600]  decade ago now it's mainstream news Walmart is gonna be and Walmart distribution
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:04.320]  centers are going to be used as FEMA camp distribution centers sounds fun
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:09.800]  doesn't it Bob it's terrible and it just goes on and on and we're here to
[2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:13.800]  report it and you people you've got to know about it and you've got to get

[2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:56.720]  miserably in accomplishing but they are continuing with their operation despite
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:06.720]  that you know I have seven different clips and we have these directly from
[2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:12.600]  the newscast I'm gonna play clips of them from YouTube so that you know where
[2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:18.840]  you can go find them according to their title the establishment counts on the
[2:24:18.840 --> 2:24:22.640]  public being ignorant they count on the public not knowing the fact so they can
[2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:29.880]  be deceived the media says it's a wild rumor that Obama wants your guns when
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:35.360]  he has the worst voting record in the Illinois state Senate and in the federal
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:41.960]  Senate and boy that is quite a record with Joe Biden and Diane Feinstein and
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:49.640]  Barbara Boxer he has lobbied for the DC gun ban total gun ban for the Chicago
[2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:56.840]  gun ban he didn't just lobby he helped write legislation to do it that is
[2:24:56.840 --> 2:24:59.760]  public even the handwritten legislation that was then put into
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:04.360]  legislation is public and it's in these clips that we have but the first clip I
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:09.840]  want to play is Joe Biden first it's governor Richards being asked and it's
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:14.240]  it's a YouTube reporter for CNN during the debates months ago the Democratic
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:21.480]  vice presidential debates and they are showing a citizen saying well here's my
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:27.160]  baby here's my AR 15 you're not gonna try to take it are you and when they cut
[2:25:27.160 --> 2:25:31.560]  to Biden he go you're crazy you're nuts you're mentally ill you don't deserve to
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:35.160]  have a gun see it's mentally ill for Biden for a citizen to have a semi
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:39.640]  automatic rifle with a scary stock but with the SWAT teams the police the
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:43.680]  military on the streets where we really should be afraid of guns in the hands of
[2:25:43.680 --> 2:25:47.800]  government historically that's a good thing so we'll play this clip come back
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:52.640]  and comment on it here it is
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:59.840]  good evening America my name is Jared Townsend from Clio, Michigan to all the
[2:25:59.840 --> 2:26:04.680]  candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other Americans
[2:26:04.680 --> 2:26:12.600]  really want to know if our babies are safe this is my baby purchase under the
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:20.160]  1994 gun ban please tell me your views thank you governor Richardson you have
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:27.520]  one of the highest NRA ratings the issue here I believe is instant background
[2:26:27.520 --> 2:26:32.720]  checks nobody who has a criminal background or as mentally ill should be
[2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:38.120]  able to get a weapon that is the key and that includes gun sales that includes
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:43.240]  gun stop right there stop right there we got a break we're gonna come back and
[2:26:43.240 --> 2:26:47.120]  go to Biden now see Richardson sounds more reasonable there but he's not it's
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:51.040]  that instant registration for confiscation they've done in every country
[2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:57.000]  now when we come back we're gonna go to Biden who just is shocked and amazed by
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:02.760]  a slave off the plantation he's like somebody in the 1860s who would see a
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:06.640]  Native American with a rifle that would have been scary a slave somebody I want
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:11.160]  to exterminate with a gun you know get that gun out of that engine's hand you
[2:27:11.160 --> 2:27:15.360]  know get that gun out of that black man's hand we'll be right back we're on

[2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:52.480]  myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain you know when you
[2:30:52.480 --> 2:30:59.040]  don't care about others you blind yourself but when you do care about the
[2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:04.520]  universe around you when you do realize you're connected in everything the
[2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:08.360]  old familiar the universe opens up to you and that's what this broadcast is all
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:16.600]  about try to kill it all it's about but I remember truly living and being
[2:31:16.600 --> 2:31:21.880]  informed you know they say it's good when the military has weapons and uses
[2:31:21.880 --> 2:31:26.360]  them against people unarmed civilians they say it's good when the police
[2:31:26.360 --> 2:31:30.200]  taser people and they die they say it's good when they wear black mask and
[2:31:30.200 --> 2:31:35.880]  beat their batons on their armor to intimidate the public they say it's
[2:31:35.880 --> 2:31:40.960]  good when the police have been caught in Canada in England in Greece in
[2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:47.000]  Australia in Denver this year Denver post headline the police attacked their
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:52.520]  own police officers so they could show the news cameras protesters attacking
[2:31:52.520 --> 2:31:58.320]  police so they could attack the crowds they just caught them in Greece dressed
[2:31:58.320 --> 2:32:01.920]  up bashing out windows attacking cars so they could show it on the news saying
[2:32:01.920 --> 2:32:04.920]  look the protesters are attacking people's cars when the protesters were
[2:32:04.920 --> 2:32:08.240]  really attacking government buildings to try to swing the rest of the public
[2:32:08.240 --> 2:32:12.040]  in behind the criminal government that's literally grabbing all the
[2:32:12.040 --> 2:32:16.000]  infrastructure handing it over to foreign banks why would the police all
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:19.840]  over the world want to stage terror attacks that's what these provocateur
[2:32:19.840 --> 2:32:23.280]  attacks are to demonize the public don't those officers know they're
[2:32:23.280 --> 2:32:27.280]  destroying their society well no their argument is with military tactics
[2:32:27.280 --> 2:32:30.720]  because the police are not militarized just like the army field manual states
[2:32:30.720 --> 2:32:34.440]  has been declassified we've got a stage terror attacks we've got a you know
[2:32:34.440 --> 2:32:39.680]  break trash cans break windows attack cars the next step is staging larger
[2:32:39.680 --> 2:32:43.920]  terror attacks so that's how the mindset begins you'll knock out a window
[2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:47.760]  why not blow up a building to blame it on their political enemies we got a fight
[2:32:47.760 --> 2:32:53.800]  dirty to win this fight now I say all that in the context of oh we're safe
[2:32:53.800 --> 2:32:58.600]  when the police have machine guns but we're not safe when the citizens have
[2:32:58.600 --> 2:33:02.720]  firearms and then they try to spend it and say well we don't want people with
[2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:07.160]  fully auto well number one is a somebody who's pretty good with a rifle and a
[2:33:07.160 --> 2:33:10.680]  handgun let me just tell you you don't want semi-auto I mean you don't want
[2:33:10.680 --> 2:33:14.680]  full auto unless you were in a machine gun nest with hundreds of troops
[2:33:14.680 --> 2:33:21.080]  charging you and you're you know have a larger you have a machine gun that's
[2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:28.680]  what that's for what troops use in real combat generally especially if they're
[2:33:28.680 --> 2:33:37.840]  trained properly is the single tap or three round burst and I found the three
[2:33:37.840 --> 2:33:46.680]  round burst that it's not even as accurate as single fire I mean you can
[2:33:46.680 --> 2:33:50.800]  drive tax with single fire the three round burst your first round is going to
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:55.440]  be good but there's going to be some pull on the rifle even if you're a
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:34:02.700]  master marksman with a three burst back in the day when I was a real gun
[2:34:02.700 --> 2:34:06.240]  aficionado you know I've talked about how we go to these big gun training
[2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:11.920]  seminars mainly police items so I had a chance to shoot quite a few fully
[2:34:11.920 --> 2:34:16.960]  automatics and I also shooting with others that have a special tax tag for
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:21.240]  fully auto and I just don't like fully auto but the point is the media knows
[2:34:21.240 --> 2:34:24.800]  the public's ignorance so they use that and then they claim oh look at all these
[2:34:24.800 --> 2:34:28.880]  thousands of different types of you know rifles worldwide made let's ban them
[2:34:28.880 --> 2:34:34.960]  because they look like a fully auto so this guy shows his semi-auto 223 it's
[2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:39.160]  got a scope on it how scary a slave and the first gun laws were against black
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:43.000]  Americans in this country you know we can have blacks being armed because they
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.640]  needed to be able to lynch them and abuse them and take their property and
[2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:51.240]  keep them in their place slaves in Rome couldn't be armed and it all boils down
[2:34:51.240 --> 2:34:56.040]  to it Nazi Germany you the citizenry couldn't be armed tyranny always
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:02.040]  disarms the population tyrants always disarm the population and they claim
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:06.080]  for the children your safety they know where they have gun restrictions they
[2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:10.520]  have higher crime rates they know more guns less crime they know people being
[2:35:10.520 --> 2:35:14.320]  armed is what this country was founded about the Revolutionary War started in
[2:35:14.320 --> 2:35:23.160]  1775 because of gun confiscation and now the public's on to them now you see
[2:35:23.160 --> 2:35:27.000]  major polls whereas about half the public was for gun control a decade ago
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:31.600]  now 70 plus percent are against it so they know they're losing the fight so
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:35.920]  they're trying to come in and brainwash the public now look at how scared Joseph
[2:35:35.920 --> 2:35:41.880]  Biden is and how he's taken back and freaked out by a slave with a rifle and
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:48.560]  he says the guy's mentally ill and he's a CNN correspondent for YouTube the
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:54.360]  guys mentally ill and that he needs to have his gun confiscated here it is
[2:35:54.360 --> 2:36:01.320]  attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the
[2:36:01.320 --> 2:36:06.120]  ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and their victims of gun
[2:36:06.120 --> 2:36:11.760]  violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:15.760]  having child care bringing parents together senator Biden are you going to
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:18.920]  be able to keep his babies safe I tell you what if that's his baby he needs
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:32.320]  help I think I think he just made an admission against self-interest I don't
[2:36:32.320 --> 2:36:37.440]  know that he's mentally qualified to own that gun I'm not being serious look
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:42.280]  this idea we go around talking about people who who own I'm the guy that
[2:36:42.280 --> 2:36:46.360]  originally wrote the assault weapons ban that that became law and then we got
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:51.480]  defeated then Barbara excuse me then Diane Feinstein went to town on it and
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:55.600]  did a great job look we should be working with law enforcement right now to
[2:36:55.600 --> 2:37:00.920]  make sure that we protect people against people who don't are not capable of
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:04.960]  knowing what to do with the gun because they're either mentally imbalanced and
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:10.200]  or because they have a criminal record time and anyway look at this guy look at
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:19.320]  this guy back it up I mean look at how threatened he is I mean he is so upset
[2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:23.160]  and the White House has these questionnaires now for anybody working
[2:37:23.160 --> 2:37:26.440]  anywhere in the executive branch even out to the White House do you own a
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:29.440]  firearm do you believe the Second Amendment and if they say yes they're
[2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:32.880]  not being hired it's okay to have the Secret Service guarding them with guns
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:37.000]  it's okay for Biden to want to use the US Army on the streets of America and the
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:40.840]  army openly admits that they're gonna be waging war on the American people they
[2:37:40.840 --> 2:37:45.280]  say we're preparing to engage the public see they they trained you to accept this
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:48.640]  police state and fighting al-qaeda and then now they're baiting and switching
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:52.440]  going there's blonde hair blue al-qaeda everywhere there's gun owners there's
[2:37:52.440 --> 2:37:58.440]  militias we've got to take their guns and then we have Barack Obama's real gun
[2:37:58.440 --> 2:38:02.840]  record and we're gonna go over some of that now let's analyze this a little
[2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:10.480]  clip of this ABC news piece dealing with the record gun sales and this is a
[2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:15.360]  month old the gun sales are only accelerating now and Obama's now coming
[2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:19.560]  out saying well I'm for the Second Amendment under Chicago and DC laws
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:23.960]  which means total ban he says we have a right to reasonably restrict them which
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:30.160]  means totally ban them because this is a criminal this is a thug that he works
[2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:34.640]  for the elite and his job is to disarm the slaves just like blacks couldn't
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:38.080]  own guns a hundred and fifty years ago in this nation first gun laws just like
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:43.640]  Native Americans I mean if senator Biden was some army general out in
[2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:47.440]  South Dakota riding down and killing Native Americans you know they they get
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:51.200]  freaked out we got engines with guns we got free people with guns they could
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:54.520]  defend themselves they don't want to go to the reservations they don't want to
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:56.680]  be disarmed they don't want to be domesticated they don't want to be
[2:38:56.680 --> 2:39:00.240]  given poison blankets they don't want their inoculations that's the modern
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:06.400]  system so oh my gosh you know a black with a gun a Native American with a
[2:39:06.400 --> 2:39:10.520]  gun it's the same thing but we're all slaves now so let's go ahead and go to
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:16.400]  this clip for the election Colorado had to deal with 1,500 applications from new
[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:23.160]  gun owners in a single day that's a record Glenn partial runs a gun store in
[2:39:23.160 --> 2:39:27.840]  Las Vegas he says his customers aren't willing to pause you see and that's what
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:32.320]  it is I've had these cowardly gun dealers for years when I walk in an Austin
[2:39:32.320 --> 2:39:36.840]  gun shop no matter what gun shop it is they'll say Alex I'm tired of you on the
[2:39:36.840 --> 2:39:40.920]  radio so I heard you number one saying that Bush was for the assault weapons
[2:39:40.920 --> 2:39:44.960]  band when he wasn't in the night and then there's always one clerk who goes
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:49.360]  no Bobby he was for it you know because they're they're in denial and the next
[2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:53.560]  will say well I hear you say it's gun registration to fill out the nicks that
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:58.400]  scares off customers then they go buy them from private sellers and I'm like
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:01.960]  well if you got together as gun owners instead of having the judo scope in our
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:05.880]  a pose like they're your savior but then always sell you out you can get
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:08.320]  together as gun dealers and repeal these uncut
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:13.160]  unconstitutional laws it is a registration they internally call the
[2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:18.160]  nicks system that now they want to put misdemeanors on it and they know long
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:21.200]  rifle shotgun or handgun they know what you've got where you live where you're
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:26.000]  at it is an application it's turning a right into a privilege and I have people
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:29.040]  in Texas come up to me live their all their lives and go Alex how do I get a
[2:40:29.040 --> 2:40:32.560]  gun how do I get a license to own one see they give you a concealed carry and
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:35.280]  then people think you have to have a license to have a gun period that's
[2:40:35.280 --> 2:40:39.000]  how it started in New York there's no license we need Vermont style where they
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:43.640]  say it's the second amendment but see under Anglo-Saxon common law under
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:47.640]  common law in Texas and everywhere else you can have a shotgun you can walk
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:50.760]  around with a handgun on your side but the police will violate common law and
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.320]  swarm you taser you attack you people try to take the rifle out put in their
[2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:58.640]  back seat of their car to go deer hunting cops show up because the neighbor
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:01.840]  sees a gun they're watching sitcoms they're watching the news they're being
[2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:05.600]  conditioned that guns are illegal when they're not and police will even ask you
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:11.000]  in Texas you got a permit for that there is no permit there a permit is is
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:19.160]  a license to do something that would be illegal it's a permission now under the
[2:41:19.160 --> 2:41:23.360]  common law in states that still follow it I can carry a rifle publicly or a
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:30.600]  handgun you understand this is all lawyer tricks but under common law you
[2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:36.600]  cannot carry concealed weapons so they come out with state laws to carry a
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:42.240]  concealed weapon under common law you do need a license because that's illegal
[2:41:42.240 --> 2:41:46.440]  you bear your arms openly as a freeman that way it's an arm culture everybody
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:49.480]  accepts it but see first they make us treat it like it's pornography or
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:53.680]  something we put in a black bag we hide it we're ashamed of it see now the moral
[2:41:53.680 --> 2:41:56.840]  authorities against it and they trick you into going and getting a concealed
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:01.480]  carry when it turns a right into a privilege instead of just demanding
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:10.720]  your right to carry a firearm see how they play these legalese tricks so but
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:15.200]  notice this guy also says yeah maybe it's Obama people coming in buying guns
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:18.520]  yeah I've talked a lot of gun dealers saying that's happening even here in
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:24.560]  Texas and this is happening because they all got on the hype bandwagon and now
[2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:28.800]  they found out he really is for gun bands and so they're even panicking see
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:32.440]  that's all part of the hype I didn't matter McCain's was anti-gun to don't
[2:42:32.440 --> 2:42:36.040]  think I'm for McCain here they're both controlled the point is we're in trouble
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:41.240]  let's go back to the clip and to gamble their guns on Obama even if they voted
[2:42:41.240 --> 2:42:45.880]  for him one of the strangest things that I've had happened the past few weeks
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:50.720]  was I've had a lot of people coming in here wearing Obama buttons and Obama
[2:42:50.720 --> 2:42:54.200]  t-shirts in here to buy guns they tell me they're in here to buy them before he
[2:42:54.200 --> 2:42:59.040]  bans them what's that telling you about it the run-on guns comes despite the
[2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:04.280]  president elects assurances he will protect the right to bear arms the NRA
[2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:10.480]  there's a different position I stop right there's a notice he says the NRA is
[2:43:10.480 --> 2:43:13.440]  never about the second amendment is never about the people you know every
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:16.920]  time they're having warrantless wiretaps they say the ACLU doesn't like it and
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:20.200]  that's a politicized organization that a lot of people don't like for other
[2:43:20.200 --> 2:43:25.160]  stances see they're minimizing you down to a subgroup the NRA the NRA was
[2:43:25.160 --> 2:43:30.680]  founded after the feds won the Civil War to arm paramilitary groups in the
[2:43:30.680 --> 2:43:35.320]  north to come in and carpet bag in the south that's a fact the NRA was founded
[2:43:35.320 --> 2:43:39.480]  as a as a gun control group I've had Larry Pratt on it read those documents
[2:43:39.480 --> 2:43:44.560]  they're the ones that got the gun control act passed in 33 they are the ones
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:48.640]  that lobbied for the 68 gun control act you walk in one of these ignorant gun
[2:43:48.640 --> 2:43:54.000]  shop places and you tell them that get out of here come me hey you think they
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:43:57.480]  could have got our guns and passed any gun control laws if the if the globalist
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:02.240]  didn't control our major group the NRA is controlled does that mean their whole
[2:44:02.240 --> 2:44:04.920]  boards control no they get a good board member occasionally and they'll always
[2:44:04.920 --> 2:44:15.880]  run them out you understand you understand now we've got clip after
[2:44:15.880 --> 2:44:21.640]  a clip of Obama saying well if it's reasonable but again he calls reasonable
[2:44:21.640 --> 2:44:27.440]  total gun ban let's go back to the just tyrant I mean he wants to disarm you
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:31.560]  100% of the time in history that means they want to abuse you and dominate you
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:34.920]  and slave you I mean it's if they know why they're doing nothing to do with a
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:39.120]  little kid he's in keeping him safe here it is if you is if we allow even the
[2:44:39.120 --> 2:44:44.400]  smallest concession that somehow guns are gonna be taken away from everybody
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:49.520]  you know if you subscribe to that view then you're you know then you're not
[2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:53.720]  gonna agree with me if on the other hand you're a gun owner here in South
[2:44:53.720 --> 2:45:02.840]  Dakota who uses your gun to hunt or to protect your family and and does so in a
[2:45:02.840 --> 2:45:08.280]  lawful way then you have nothing worried about for me but many gun owners
[2:45:08.280 --> 2:45:12.440]  remember something Obama said pause before over and over again yeah back up
[2:45:12.440 --> 2:45:16.160]  about 10 seconds over and over again he says nothing to worry about for me and
[2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:21.080]  when Obama is lying particularly bad he gets in this real trance like like
[2:45:21.080 --> 2:45:26.040]  mpr and that's a type of neuro linguistic programming they get in this
[2:45:26.040 --> 2:45:31.800]  real calm soothing I mean this guy's programming everything's all right but
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:35.760]  if you're a reasonable if you're a South Dakota and he's talking to that group of
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:39.280]  people like if you're part of this tribe if you know if you're a reasonable
[2:45:39.280 --> 2:45:42.840]  South Dakota and whatever group he's talking to like you because you're a
[2:45:42.840 --> 2:45:48.800]  South Dakota and you're you're you're special he's hitting neuro linguistic
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:53.920]  programming he's using tribal programs a local programming I mean it's it's
[2:45:53.920 --> 2:45:57.680]  it's it's all multifaceted very deceptive but then we have all these
[2:45:57.680 --> 2:46:00.880]  clips of him going well if you think we should just take all the guns at once
[2:46:00.880 --> 2:46:04.040]  you know laterally that may not be constitutional but we're gonna take a
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:08.800]  lot of them you know I've got that clip I mean this guy passed bills and tried to
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:13.720]  pass bills to take all your guns okay he did that when he was in Illinois he is
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:20.400]  a piece of filth here it is and does so in a lawful way then you have nothing
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:25.600]  worry about for me but many gun owners remember something Obama said before
[2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:44.640]  that the National Rifle Association has done its best to scare gun owners
[2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:49.640]  about Obama stop right there stop right there they've done their best to scare
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:53.760]  yeah so they can look like they're the group you can trust so they can get your
[2:46:53.760 --> 2:46:58.360]  millions of dollars a year of in contributions and then go Judas Goat and
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:05.120]  sell you out I mean this ABC news piece isn't showing you all the bills he
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:08.200]  actually authored word-for-word with bill numbers we're gonna show that to you
[2:47:08.200 --> 2:47:13.840]  coming up here it is what Barack Obama called America's 80 million gun owners
[2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:17.920]  don't tell me words don't matter gun owners have their own word for Barack
[2:47:17.920 --> 2:47:23.040]  Obama Obama voted four times to deny citizens the right of self-protection
[2:47:23.040 --> 2:47:28.440]  even in their home look at his voting record not his words all listen to his
[2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:32.960]  words look at his actions look at his voting record and if you have the
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:36.080]  ability to take everything away I guarantee it I promise you've been on a
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:38.760]  shot of a doubt if you had the ability only reason he doesn't it's because
[2:47:38.760 --> 2:47:42.280]  people stand up to him and stop them to some degree but he's gonna have with the
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:44.760]  Democratic you know Congress and everything he's gonna be able to push
[2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:48.040]  through whatever he wants to now he says he doesn't want to take them away
[2:47:48.040 --> 2:47:52.040]  lying through his teeth look at his voting record don't listen to his words
[2:47:52.040 --> 2:47:56.120]  look at his actions that's all I have to say on about that well Barack Obama
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:48:00.920]  doesn't believe that the citizens have the right to own a handgun period he
[2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:05.640]  wants them only for law enforcement and for the military that's right that just
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:10.320]  makes we're gonna come back folks with his real record now again but they're
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:14.400]  telling you oh we don't want your guns but we do want to ban them I mean he is
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:19.400]  for total gun ban he has supported and voted and pushed for that we're gonna
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:23.040]  come back with the facts stay with us
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:29.920]  did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people

[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:47.960]  Nations small armed disarmament summit in New York City and many times I read
[2:51:47.960 --> 2:51:52.600]  off the official UN website their agenda and they stated that civilian
[2:51:52.600 --> 2:51:59.120]  ownership of firearms threatens in their words the legitimate power monopoly of
[2:51:59.120 --> 2:52:05.120]  the state power monopoly of the state only the government which is illegitimate
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:07.800]  and doesn't do what the people want or what's constitutional that only exists
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:13.440]  for foreign banks to use it as a suction proboscis to suck our economy drive
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:17.920]  that's why tyrannical governments want your guns want your weapons for thousands
[2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:22.600]  of years it's always the same because it threatens their power monopoly their
[2:52:22.600 --> 2:52:27.520]  power monopoly they want a power monopoly they don't want you to have a
[2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:32.560]  check and balance against them and now openly I've had multiple congressmen on
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:37.280]  senator inhofe we've played the audio they were threatened with martial law
[2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:41.640]  they didn't pass the bailout the bailout was a total martial law for Wall
[2:52:41.640 --> 2:52:45.680]  Street Wall Street took over the government ladies and gentlemen Congress
[2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:50.240]  has no authority now over eight and a half trillion have been stolen and we
[2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:55.120]  have even gotten the new numbers in three weeks I'm sure it's far worse now so
[2:52:55.120 --> 2:52:59.760]  here is Obama's real record this is a TV ad that ran during the election and you
[2:52:59.760 --> 2:53:04.120]  can go pull up all these bill numbers all of it and this is a hundred and ten
[2:53:04.120 --> 2:53:08.760]  percent accurate in fact it's far worse than even this okay and Bush didn't
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:12.400]  triple the size of the BATF for nothing this has all been planned all staged
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:17.760]  let's go ahead and go to that next clip here it is the right to bear arms is one
[2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:22.760]  of the fundamental ideals on which our nation was founded hard-working law
[2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:26.840]  abiding Americans have for generations enjoyed this freedom in their
[2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:32.480]  communities and with their families but Barack Obama believes that many Americans
[2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:38.000]  simply claim to guns in times of economic distress speaking behind closed
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:43.760]  doors to an audience of San Francisco donors Barack Obama said they cling to

[2:53:49.480 --> 2:53:55.840]  record is long in 2004 he voted against legislation drafted to protect homeowners
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:54:02.000]  from prosecution in cases where they used a firearm to halt a home invasion in
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:07.640]  2003 he voted in support of legislation that would have effectively banned most
[2:54:07.640 --> 2:54:12.920]  of the privately held hunting shotguns target rifles and black powder rifles
[2:54:12.920 --> 2:54:19.160]  in Illinois and in 1996 Obama supported a ban on the manufacture sale and
[2:54:19.160 --> 2:54:24.880]  possession of handguns but now Obama's running for president and claims no
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:30.440]  knowledge of this even though his handwriting is all over it Barack Obama

[2:56:13.400 --> 2:56:16.760]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:20.480]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:23.960]  in a bread line you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:27.800]  dough and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:31.320]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[2:56:31.320 --> 2:56:34.960]  for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[2:56:34.960 --> 2:56:38.160]  off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty
[2:56:38.160 --> 2:56:42.120]  billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:46.280]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:50.240]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:54.960]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[2:56:54.960 --> 2:56:58.940]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[2:56:58.940 --> 2:57:03.200]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[2:57:03.200 --> 2:57:07.040]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:10.640]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:14.800]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:18.840]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:22.520]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:26.680]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[2:57:26.680 --> 2:57:29.560]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:33.120]  supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot less control
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:37.360]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:40.520]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[2:57:40.520 --> 2:57:44.520]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from

[2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:38.720]  I'm going over Barack Obama who supported the DC gun ban supports the
[2:58:38.720 --> 2:58:43.080]  Chicago total victim disarmament there in the crime capital of the United States
[2:58:43.080 --> 2:58:49.320]  absolutely outrageous and then they have the nerve to deny what they're doing
[2:58:49.320 --> 2:58:52.840]  they've been attacking importers using regulations to shut them down just as
[2:58:52.840 --> 2:58:57.600]  Bush did they're rating a record number of gun stores they're going after gun
[2:58:57.600 --> 2:59:01.560]  shows Obama I have more clips here is now saying he does want to shut down
[2:59:01.560 --> 2:59:05.280]  private sale of guns that means if you want to sell a rifle your cousin your
[2:59:05.280 --> 2:59:10.840]  neighbor your son you get swat team you go to prison you go to the gun show to
[2:59:10.840 --> 2:59:16.240]  sell somebody a rifle or handgun that shut down then everything has to be a
[2:59:16.240 --> 2:59:20.640]  registered transfer to even if you give your grandson a 22 rifle when he's 10
[2:59:20.640 --> 2:59:24.600]  years old they even want to start registering and making you do a
[2:59:24.600 --> 2:59:28.920]  background check for BB guns many cities are banning pellet guns and BB guns
[2:59:28.920 --> 2:59:34.240]  are restricting them England's trying to do the same thing and in England they
[2:59:34.240 --> 2:59:37.800]  prosecute you in Canada they prosecute you if you defend yourself now we're
[2:59:37.800 --> 2:59:43.200]  seeing some US cities prosecute people that try to defend themselves I mean
[2:59:43.200 --> 2:59:49.440]  this is just absolutely outrageous that all of this is going on earlier in the
[2:59:49.440 --> 2:59:54.440]  week we had Robert Wannick on he's the 14-year-old high school student who's
[2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:57.160]  been had police called on him for talking about the Bill of Rights and
[2:59:57.160 --> 3:00:00.720]  Constitution they told him he's not allowed to tell people 9-11's an inside
[3:00:00.720 --> 3:00:04.280]  job but there's no free speech they have cameras in the school classrooms in the
[3:00:04.280 --> 3:00:08.660]  halls many schools have cameras now in the bathrooms same thing in England this
[3:00:08.660 --> 3:00:14.600]  total grid where the schools literally are government reeducation camps where
[3:00:14.600 --> 3:00:18.560]  they literally brainwash you and teach you about the new world order he's also
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:22.200]  of course his textbook they have in his high school that they use all over the
[3:00:22.200 --> 3:00:25.440]  country one of the major publishers teaches them that world government's
[3:00:25.440 --> 3:00:28.560]  good new world order is good and if he raises his hand and says I don't want
[3:00:28.560 --> 3:00:32.760]  world government they come to him and say it doesn't say new world order it
[3:00:32.760 --> 3:00:38.080]  doesn't exist now people that sounds crazy if you study Soviet reeducation
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:44.440]  camps if you study Nazi reeducation camps if you study Pol Pot they would do
[3:00:44.440 --> 3:00:48.920]  the same thing they act crazy they say you're nuts they will say something we
[3:00:48.920 --> 3:00:53.200]  need world government and then say but it doesn't exist and this is part of just
[3:00:53.200 --> 3:00:58.960]  a mass mental illness of just confusing people it's part of reprogramming and it
[3:00:58.960 --> 3:01:02.640]  gets into sophisticated psychology and they just teach the teachers who are
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:06.120]  just taught to do this in the principles to just regurgitate it they're just
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:09.680]  programmed themselves and don't realize what they're part of also zero
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:15.400]  tolerance where over-the-counter cough drops that have no type of drug in them
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:18.600]  this girl that got in trouble and kicked out of school and the police are
[3:01:18.600 --> 3:01:22.920]  looking at arresting her in Florida last time I checked there wasn't even men
[3:01:22.920 --> 3:01:27.560]  fall in the halls it was a honey holes in the candy section she gave it to some
[3:01:27.560 --> 3:01:31.800]  friends they said you're a drug dealer again sounds crazy sounds ridiculous
[3:01:31.800 --> 3:01:36.920]  again and they always proudly say zero tolerance for our children's safety it's
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:41.600]  about unreasonableness being honored unreasonableness you know setting the
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:45.920]  precedent to do ridiculous things so they can do more and more wild things
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:49.560]  it's like the cases where they'll take somebody into the hospital after car
[3:01:49.560 --> 3:01:52.600]  wreck and say we're gonna take you know we want a urine sample to see if you're
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:56.760]  on drugs the person say I can't urinate they'll walk a cop in taserum over and
[3:01:56.760 --> 3:02:01.320]  over again until they answer the question or you'll have some robberies in
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:05.240]  Arkansas or Oklahoma or Kentucky they'll just say we have 24-hour-a-day curfews
[3:02:05.240 --> 3:02:09.360]  now checkpoints everyone you're only allowed to go to work we stop you and
[3:02:09.360 --> 3:02:13.800]  make sure you're only going to work I mean this is happening in America and the
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:17.080]  feds are the ones pushing it and we've warned you all these years that they were
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.800]  gonna put troops on the streets they were going to use them against the
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:25.880]  American people and now they are actually announcing it and doing it and
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:28.680]  they're baiting and switching they're still saying it's for al-qaeda but also
[3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:31.880]  for the American people but see it was really always for the American people
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:38.360]  al-qaeda was their creation and so this is what we face as a society today so in
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:43.920]  closing as I got cut off a bit there at the last hour we got cut off from the
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:47.680]  network in Minnesota but our backup kicked in so we lost about five seconds

[3:06:38.800 --> 3:06:43.080]  most of an hour today because he's got video the police coming to the school
[3:06:43.080 --> 3:06:47.560]  brainwashing him police threatening to arrest him for saying he has
[3:06:47.560 --> 3:06:52.800]  constitutional rights they're allowed to work t-shirts with messages in their
[3:06:52.800 --> 3:06:58.480]  yearbook but he said 9-11 was an inside job so they photo shopped it out the

[3:07:02.640 --> 3:07:06.440]  then when he says that he doesn't like that it's not a good idea they tell him
[3:07:06.440 --> 3:07:10.960]  that doesn't exist so folks I don't think you realize just how controlled the

[3:07:24.400 --> 3:07:28.600]  grant to be BATF officers auxiliary officers in the schools they have the
[3:07:28.600 --> 3:07:33.600]  children starting in sixth and seventh grade in most areas writing dossiers on
[3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:41.520]  their parents I show those documents in from Tennessee in South Carolina in my
[3:07:41.520 --> 3:07:45.560]  film police state to the takeover where it says that they write dossiers on
[3:07:45.560 --> 3:07:51.160]  their parents it's a six month or single semester course I guess three month four
[3:07:51.160 --> 3:07:56.840]  month course in the school all of this and this is classical tyranny having
[3:07:56.840 --> 3:08:00.600]  24 hour a day curfews is classical tyranny having the media announced they're
[3:08:00.600 --> 3:08:03.680]  going to use troops on the streets is classical tyranny having cameras going
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:07.000]  up everywhere as classical tyranny having face scanning systems going in
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:11.680]  everywhere as tyranny all these states and the UK but also in the US saying
[3:08:11.680 --> 3:08:14.760]  we're going to put satellite tracker boxes in your car and tax you down the
[3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:18.880]  road and track everywhere you go and by the way we're dialing in and listening
[3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:21.680]  to you over your cell phone even when it's turned off and by the way your
[3:08:21.680 --> 3:08:24.680]  digital cable boxes watch what you watch and track everything you do and
[3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:28.400]  that's reported back to the government your Tevo system and by the way Google
[3:08:28.400 --> 3:08:32.400]  is using the microphones built-in and computers and video cameras to watch you
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:37.280]  and listen to you with AI keyword software to keep dossiers on you Google
[3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:42.760]  announces this and the public just goes oh really or oh I don't believe that this
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:46.600]  is a mega Orwellville it's just all around us but we still have our second
[3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:49.280]  amendment we still have our first amendment but they're trying to attack
[3:08:49.280 --> 3:08:55.920]  those right now did you guys find that clip with Robert Wannick when he's a
[3:08:55.920 --> 3:09:02.480]  when where he's talking about how they blacked out his shirt this has been
[3:09:02.480 --> 3:09:05.920]  quite a saga let's play a few minutes of that then we'll go to him then we'll go
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:10.040]  back through everything else that's happened to him in this camp and that's
[3:09:10.040 --> 3:09:15.080]  what it's a reeducation camp and for those that doubt me in Texas in Michigan
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:18.320]  in all over the country we've seen these reports but I've been to these drills
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:23.520]  they will unannounced come into a school announce the terrorists are attacking
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:27.920]  they will lock the children in their rooms this isn't in the elementary
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:31.880]  sometimes for eight hours they make them urinate and defecate in trash cans
[3:09:31.880 --> 3:09:36.600]  don't believe me just Google police made children defecate or use
[3:09:36.600 --> 3:09:40.080]  bathroom and trash cans you'll see that all over the country and the cops always
[3:09:40.080 --> 3:09:43.000]  go well it was part of the federal grant it be secret was part and the
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:46.920]  children aren't fed to also freak them out and give them low blood sugar they'll
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:49.560]  also have the elementary students this has been going on for a decade we've got
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:55.080]  footage of it first place we saw it was Missouri around on the Kansas border they
[3:09:55.080 --> 3:09:59.720]  would in one town load the elementary students at gunpoint with their hands
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:03.240]  behind their heads on buses and take them to a local FEMA center without
[3:10:03.240 --> 3:10:07.200]  telling the parents this is part of learned helplessness training children
[3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:10.920]  that when men in black uniforms come you just you just lay down you just fall
[3:10:10.920 --> 3:10:18.360]  down I had one lady on it was in the Minneapolis St. Paul newspaper a few
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:23.200]  years ago her lawyer on they came unannounced to the school even only the
[3:10:23.200 --> 3:10:26.040]  administrators knew when to the portable buildings told the teachers we're
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:29.280]  gonna kill you took them out in the woods with the children people fell over
[3:10:29.280 --> 3:10:33.120]  they defecated on themselves this was in the news they had nervous breakdowns in
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:37.240]  the cops were like what's wrong in the case of Michigan all over the state
[3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:43.800]  there's been the Associated Press four years ago Google this school shooting
[3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:52.000]  drill Michigan school I'm trying to go back to the exact headline from the AP
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:59.920]  was all over the news police drill at school Michigan now the the main one
[3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:03.400]  that comes up is there's been three cases where the cops shoot themselves in
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:08.720]  the drills in Michigan but I don't want those I want for some reason those got
[3:11:08.720 --> 3:11:11.960]  more visits so this are those articles with the top last time I checked I want
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:15.520]  the one and we do this on air so folks can learn how to find us if we're
[3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:19.120]  talking about so this isn't just me up there saying it they show up in
[3:11:19.120 --> 3:11:23.640]  elementary schools they blow up a bus set it on fire and from everybody they've
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:26.960]  done this in Belton to I caught them up and had troops US Army walk over and say
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:32.640]  turn your cameras off with Marines that's in road to tyranny in 2000 that's
[3:11:32.640 --> 3:11:37.040]  when we shot the footage that's in road to tyranny and they get the children out
[3:11:37.040 --> 3:11:40.000]  they don't know what's going on they throw fake blood on them they tell them
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:44.640]  you're gonna die and the police scream I'm a militia I don't like public school
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:48.960]  I'm a militia I don't like you not liking my second amendment I'm going to
[3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:52.160]  kill you for life those children are gonna hate guns they're gonna hate the
[3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:55.600]  second amendment they're gonna hate militias and and the name of the terror
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:58.840]  group they have in Michigan they do is all of the country that attacks the
[3:11:58.840 --> 3:12:05.120]  children is home schoolers against public education now the police play the
[3:12:05.120 --> 3:12:09.920]  part to demonize home schoolers and they run around screaming throwing fake
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:13.320]  blood on children blowing things up in the parking lot they have little kids
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:17.000]  come out all the sudden vehicles jump up men in uniforms jump out screaming
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:21.160]  we're militias we're against public schools we're home schoolers we're
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:25.040]  going to kill you and the children just going to catatonic freakouts I mean
[3:12:25.040 --> 3:12:30.760]  this is in the news this is hardcore reeducation camp I mean this is what
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:34.240]  they do in reeducation camps but see now they're turning all of America into a
[3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:39.360]  reeducation camp it's a reeducation camp the thousands of times from
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:43.360]  California to New York to Florida to Texas where they say we're giving you
[3:12:43.360 --> 3:12:48.520]  hundred dollar gift certificates if you come turn in your guns and it's always
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:52.320]  an old grandpa whose daughter you know he's going to the nursing home you see
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:56.000]  it because they pulled the women there it's always 80% women out there and
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:59.880]  they're they're handing in $5,000 carved shot guns made in England they're
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:02.800]  handing in you know having no idea how much money they could have made just
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:06.400]  alone to the police and some people bring in old cheap guns and get the
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:10.160]  hundred dollar gift certificate and the images put on the news of illegal guns
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:13.920]  being turned in and it creates the image the acclimation of seeing everybody
[3:13:13.920 --> 3:13:18.640]  turning their guns in and the police always get caught is or not all I've
[3:13:18.640 --> 3:13:23.280]  seen thousands of cases in the news over the 15 years I've been studying 13
[3:13:23.280 --> 3:13:26.680]  years on air we always hear about cops selling I've seen this I mean there's
[3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:31.280]  thousands of cases of cops selling guns that were seized or guns that were
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:37.080]  turned in you can Google that were you able to find a clip well man I know
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:40.240]  that's the video clip but were you able to find the Google about the
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:43.360]  particular one where they were telling the children they were going to kill
[3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:46.760]  them and they were homeschoolers we're homeschoolers we're here to kill you
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:53.440]  again to demonize homeschooling this is hardcore mind control but let's go
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:58.520]  ahead and play a clip of Robert Wannick where he's talking about how they
[3:13:58.520 --> 3:14:04.320]  restricted him from being able to engage in the First Amendment here it is
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:09.600]  I'm going to talk about something that recently happened in school approximately
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:15.280]  3 p.m. dismissals at 3 18 3 p.m. I was assisting a student who had been
[3:14:15.280 --> 3:14:20.040]  assaulted by another student with an object thrown at him and I was talking
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:24.200]  to him and the teacher comes over and says shut up say one more thing you're
[3:14:24.200 --> 3:14:27.880]  out and did you just see what happened to them and I said this is America this
[3:14:27.880 --> 3:14:34.600]  is not a dictatorship she said leave so I left I sat down in the office 10
[3:14:34.600 --> 3:14:39.160]  minutes till school gets out said what am I being written up for disrespect I'm
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:43.320]  told to leave then you know what I'm gonna get rolled up so then they say
[3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:47.680]  Robert you're gonna have to be quiet why do I have to be quiet be quiet why do
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:54.400]  I have to be quiet shut up shut up shut up shut up and go in that room
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:15:01.680]  what a disgusting kid that kid that's enough that's another clip where they
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:04.840]  then call the police on him for mentioning the Constitution we'll get
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:08.440]  him to tell us that story himself that the clip I wanted to play was where the
[3:15:08.440 --> 3:15:12.520]  9-11 truth teacher one of the first clips he did but let's just go ahead and go
[3:15:12.520 --> 3:15:17.600]  to him and we'll play that clip a little bit longer later in the show
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:22.240]  Robert good to have you back with us yeah glad to be back on Alex you bet
[3:15:22.240 --> 3:15:27.240]  look recap everything that's happened to you at this re-education camp known as
[3:15:27.240 --> 3:15:31.160]  a public school a federalization brainwashing center social engineering
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:34.960]  center and I mean just basically all these things that have happened a brief
[3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:40.160]  synopsis of the saga then we'll go through them all here well last year when
[3:15:40.160 --> 3:15:45.400]  I was a freshman at my high school everything went fine and I wasn't a
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:51.040]  9-11 truth or and I wasn't into this new world order and then I went to science
[3:15:51.040 --> 3:15:56.160]  class I was told that we were gonna learn about the physics of 9-11 they
[3:15:56.160 --> 3:16:01.600]  then played a hit piece movie basically saying that you know the fire was hot
[3:16:01.600 --> 3:16:06.120]  enough to completely melt the steel and that it was structural failure which by
[3:16:06.120 --> 3:16:10.560]  the way they admit that it didn't melt the steel now now so yeah that was an
[3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:15.120]  older lie so so you were given an older version of the of the Ministry of
[3:16:15.120 --> 3:16:20.240]  Truth go ahead yeah and then that's how I became a 9-11 truth or so then when I
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:24.840]  became big and 9-11 truth in school and started passing all flyers and DVDs this
[3:16:24.840 --> 3:16:29.920]  is when I became public enemy number one the principal told my parents that he
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:33.760]  had a red flag up for me and that he was gonna be watching me very closely
[3:16:33.760 --> 3:16:41.040]  because just because I was standing up for 9-11 truth we got one that can see you
[3:16:41.040 --> 3:16:45.520]  know from they live with the sunglasses they're like got one that can see go
[3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:52.200]  ahead and so then later on in the school year we were just in geography class and
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:57.120]  had a substitute teacher when two students began arguing one student then
[3:16:57.120 --> 3:17:02.360]  flew or one student then through an agenda book which is a pretty kind of
[3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:06.600]  small item but it's still a book it's got binding on it through it and hit
[3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:11.160]  another kid in the crotch the kid then proceeded to fall down about five
[3:17:11.160 --> 3:17:14.760]  minutes later it happened again struck in the crotch again this happened a total
[3:17:14.760 --> 3:17:18.240]  of three times that's when I was sitting right next to the incident watching the
[3:17:18.240 --> 3:17:22.240]  movie when I just started holding a conversation with the injured kid I was
[3:17:22.240 --> 3:17:26.640]  told to shut up instead of retaliating against the teacher I just tried to tell
[3:17:26.640 --> 3:17:30.160]  her this kid has been assaulted I'm just talking she didn't want to hear it
[3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:34.120]  because you know we got that red flag up for the for the 9-11 truth or in the
[3:17:34.120 --> 3:17:38.520]  school that's right gotta pick on exact that's how reeducation camp works those
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:43.000]  that don't play ball and team up with the jail guards they get picked on you
[3:17:43.000 --> 3:17:46.760]  they get ostracized they don't get as much food they get tortured and then
[3:17:46.760 --> 3:17:51.240]  they're slowly ambiently turning up the heat till many schools are full bore
[3:17:51.240 --> 3:17:55.480]  prison reeducation camps exactly it was all right so you're in the

[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:08.280]  comply not being disrespectful I just comply and I'm told to go to the main
[3:24:08.280 --> 3:24:13.880]  office there's keep in mind that this is 3 p.m. and school gets out at 3 18 so
[3:24:13.880 --> 3:24:17.840]  there's only 18 minutes left to school they then go on and they're kind of
[3:24:17.840 --> 3:24:21.440]  taunting me saying oh you got his attention now and I said for what and
[3:24:21.440 --> 3:24:27.640]  they go well hobble for disrespect I said disrespect I was just talking and
[3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:30.840]  that I wasn't listened to and then they said you know what you're gonna have to
[3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:35.360]  be quiet and I said if you can please stay why I'm getting a detention then
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:39.880]  I'll be quiet then that really made them mad they sent me into a solitary
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:45.560]  confinement type of room a room with three or four chairs one middle table
[3:24:45.560 --> 3:24:48.920]  and this is what they do they give kids in school suspension if they speak out
[3:24:48.920 --> 3:24:54.000]  and if you go if you miss a detention for any reason even if it's legitimate if
[3:24:54.000 --> 3:24:58.480]  you can't go to an after-school detention you get set for the whole eight
[3:24:58.480 --> 3:25:01.920]  hours of school day in the solitary confinement well that's why in the
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:05.680]  Soviet Union they had 12-hour class days admittedly to break up the family and
[3:25:05.680 --> 3:25:09.400]  get full government control now we're moving to a 10-hour 12-hour workday they

[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:16.960]  care of them we have after-school programs again making that the center of
[3:25:16.960 --> 3:25:22.720]  the community now continue the police came yes as I was in the solitary
[3:25:22.720 --> 3:25:26.280]  confinement room they just kept going on saying that you know he's a bad kid
[3:25:26.280 --> 3:25:31.080]  he's disrespectful just talking to themselves and I said I'm trying to get
[3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:35.760]  you to speak up so they can go after you yes so then I said I'd like an
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:39.320]  opportunity to find myself you can't talk I mean why would you talk in an
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:42.840]  indoctrination camp and then I said you know what the first amendment is I have
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:47.400]  free speech to and there they go you're not how dare you have a kid that knows
[3:25:47.400 --> 3:25:51.640]  his rights California court a California court ruled three months ago that

[3:30:26.280 --> 3:30:31.040]  acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise ph balance is the
[3:30:31.040 --> 3:30:34.560]  foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of
[3:30:34.560 --> 3:30:38.640]  disease people who alkalized the water they drink experience normalized blood

[3:30:43.200 --> 3:30:47.600]  alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people are overly acidic the
[3:30:47.600 --> 3:30:51.480]  fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment that
[3:30:51.480 --> 3:30:55.200]  accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't
[3:30:55.200 --> 3:31:00.320]  neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body now alcovision

[3:32:25.960 --> 3:32:29.200]  giving a gift I know they told you how to hand stuff out before you've told us
[3:32:29.200 --> 3:32:33.600]  saying it's political speech well I mean of course it's political speech you
[3:32:33.600 --> 3:32:37.560]  know campaigning it's not campaigning but you know now they isolate with these
[3:32:37.560 --> 3:32:42.680]  campaign laws and spit that but they're miss a miss a pointing misusing that
[3:32:42.680 --> 3:32:46.320]  there's no specific law on you you know giving out any material you say no first
[3:32:46.320 --> 3:32:50.200]  amendment or if you want we're gonna go back to you in a minute I just want to
[3:32:50.200 --> 3:32:55.920]  make this point if you want what you do is you start a student organization and
[3:32:55.920 --> 3:32:59.800]  then they try to stop you there you got a major lawsuit and I'd call it students
[3:32:59.800 --> 3:33:03.240]  for free speech in the name of your school and then they can't stop you for
[3:33:03.240 --> 3:33:06.280]  meeting after school they can't stop you for meeting in the library meeting
[3:33:06.280 --> 3:33:09.760]  somewhere else they'll probably try to send provocateurs in and then you can
[3:33:09.760 --> 3:33:13.040]  hand out those films or you can get 10 of your friends to hand out 10 a piece
[3:33:13.040 --> 3:33:16.800]  and then even videotape you know handing those out or you can tell
[3:33:16.800 --> 3:33:21.360]  everybody meet me out on the corner off the school property because that's even
[3:33:21.360 --> 3:33:25.240]  better than they'll kind of come stop that and it'll and will illustrate who
[3:33:25.240 --> 3:33:30.200]  they are in America you know something out of the Soviet Union give them the
[3:33:30.200 --> 3:33:35.960]  100 copies but keep a few copies by a DVD burner and burn copies of truth
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:39.800]  rising and then that way it can be endless and then get together with 10
[3:33:39.800 --> 3:33:43.160]  20-year friends recruit more people to where it's not just you having to pay
[3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:47.280]  to make copies of them and then give everybody in the school a truth rising
[3:33:47.280 --> 3:33:52.120]  and explain to them that the government camp is going we're rebelling with the
[3:33:52.120 --> 3:33:56.120]  first amendment inside the camp that you're not gonna go along with that now
[3:33:56.120 --> 3:34:00.360]  before we go back to him I want to tell the listeners out there we can't give

[3:34:38.920 --> 3:34:42.320]  training camp known as a school the federalization center the brainwashing
[3:34:42.320 --> 3:34:46.680]  center so people can peacefully mail nice letter to the school with copies of my
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:53.160]  films or other films and material that way we can saturate the administration
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:34:56.200]  who probably aren't evil people they've been conditioned that this tyranny is
[3:34:56.200 --> 3:35:00.680]  okay they've been conditioned that citizens speaking out being involved is
[3:35:00.680 --> 3:35:04.840]  a bad thing and for those that are doubting this it's illegal under the
[3:35:04.840 --> 3:35:07.560]  federally written guidelines that schools have adopted and states have
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:11.920]  adopted that when you're late to class three times in Austin Texas they arrest
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:16.520]  you they tell you're under arrest they come pull you out of school they have
[3:35:16.520 --> 3:35:19.680]  your parents come down they bring you to a little courtroom in the schools is
[3:35:19.680 --> 3:35:23.200]  all over the country most most schools have it most school districts and they
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:27.000]  tell you okay you have got truancy you're a criminal you're gonna go to jail if
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:30.920]  you don't sign this and a free country they don't say you're going to jail if
[3:35:30.920 --> 3:35:33.520]  you don't sign this because the truth is they couldn't send you to jail for being
[3:35:33.520 --> 3:35:37.800]  late to class they're again twisting the truancy law which is 14 unaccused
[3:35:37.800 --> 3:35:44.520]  absences in a semester in Texas they call it the abstent absent student
[3:35:44.520 --> 3:35:49.920]  assistance program in Austin we sued them 10 years ago and they had to back
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:54.600]  off for a while this would be where the whole family has the flu this happened
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:36:00.920]  to Mike Hansen they're all sick on their backs in their beds Mike Hansen then
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:04.360]  knock knock knock within two hours of his children not being at school instead
[3:36:04.360 --> 3:36:07.520]  of just calling and saying where are your children or a note or asking for a
[3:36:07.520 --> 3:36:10.600]  note the next day now they're there banging and they come to the door with
[3:36:10.600 --> 3:36:15.480]  the flu and the cop goes let me in let me in you know your child's truan he's
[3:36:15.480 --> 3:36:20.560]  like what and then they call more police and then we went out and made a big
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:22.800]  deal out and thought they were stealing people's kids everywhere and they had to
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:26.840]  back off a bit the point is it's lawless just like schools remember the
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:31.800]  Maryland case last year it was on the news police dogs 2,000 children outside
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:34.920]  of courthouse being injected the judge out there saying it's the law you have
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:37.880]  to take vaccinations the people crying saying I don't want them I hear they're
[3:36:37.880 --> 3:36:45.480]  bad for me there was no law I had the state prosecutor on from from and he
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:48.800]  was based in Prince George County and he said I don't vaccinate my kids yeah
[3:36:48.800 --> 3:36:51.680]  you're right it was no law yeah you're right we're using truancy laws see they
[3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:56.120]  say oh you haven't vaccinated so you can't be in school and then when they
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:36:59.800]  kick you out of school for not being vaccinated they've made you truan then
[3:36:59.800 --> 3:37:03.120]  they charge you a truancy when there's no law you had to have the shot and they
[3:37:03.120 --> 3:37:06.880]  have to give you a waiver if you ask for it so see it's all color of law crime
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:12.720]  it's very very corrupt very very wicked and you can't make this type stuff up so
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:15.440]  we're gonna go back to Robert here in just one moment and I'm gonna take
[3:37:15.440 --> 3:37:19.040]  calls specifically for our guests so give me a new list please John up in
[3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:22.240]  Minnesota of callers that specifically want to talk to the guest I'm sorry to

[3:37:25.920 --> 3:37:30.080]  the point is I figure you want to hear a few you know comments directly or what's
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:34.280]  happening in your child's school or if you're a young person I kind of need to
[3:37:34.280 --> 3:37:37.040]  clear the phone lines so young people can call in with their own stories
[3:37:37.040 --> 3:37:42.320]  briefly we could do hours on this but before I go back to our guest I want to
[3:37:42.320 --> 3:37:46.600]  tell folks about my solar back up dot com the websites my solar back up dot

[3:37:51.440 --> 3:37:54.720]  electrical power hurricane snow ice storms listeners should move towards
[3:37:54.720 --> 3:37:56.840]  getting off the grid or being self-sufficient here's a good way to
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:01.000]  do that a solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:05.080]  solutions from science it's designed to provide 1800 watts of power on demand in
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:09.040]  the event of any disaster or outage you get an emergency power backup kits
[3:38:09.040 --> 3:38:12.880]  would consist of the power source 1800 power plant and high efficiency solar
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:17.520]  panel designed to provide endless electricity so folks I hope you check
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:25.200]  them out at my solar back up dot com or 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 my solar
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:31.920]  back up dot com a great unit and on top of that please go to info wars dot com
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:36.000]  please get in game get terror storm get truth rising fabled enemies the
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:39.840]  establishment doesn't want people to see these this is hurting them badly the
[3:38:39.840 --> 3:38:44.000]  power of giving people in this visual society visual learners these films
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:47.520]  these are hard-hitting compelling exciting well done these are the best
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:51.200]  films out there people need to see them and if you have my films and you've
[3:38:51.200 --> 3:38:54.400]  seen them but you haven't made copies make copies or give the copies you got
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:58.480]  the people spread this information people are ready to hear and listen like
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:03.520]  never before now robert wonick again it's your first amendment right we're
[3:39:03.520 --> 3:39:07.240]  standing behind you you need to do this in a professional manner what you've
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:13.240]  been doing but understand you are in danger I mean they will try to trump
[3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:16.640]  stuff up at least in past experience with our school so be I would be very
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:21.120]  professional very calm about all this I would officially start your own student
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:25.280]  group and then when they try to deny you that student group we call the first
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:29.640]  amendment you know organization or bill of rights defense league in the name of
[3:39:29.640 --> 3:39:34.720]  your school and then and then that's the way you educate people and then they'll
[3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:37.840]  try to deny you that and then you've got a bigger issue and that's how we force
[3:39:37.840 --> 3:39:41.760]  them to defend the republic and not the enemies of it but what are you gonna do
[3:39:41.760 --> 3:39:45.840]  with a hundred bumper stickers and DVDs I'm gonna send you see now that we have
[3:39:45.840 --> 3:39:51.040]  students on our side I can get other students to hand these out we can hand
[3:39:51.040 --> 3:39:55.480]  these out to all the students they will willingly take them and watch them all
[3:39:55.480 --> 3:39:59.080]  these students follow my YouTube channel I've gotten compliments from the
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:03.720]  principal son on some of my videos and these DVDs will be a hit in the school
[3:40:03.720 --> 3:40:08.120]  these bumper stickers will go all over they'll circulate like complete madness
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:12.440]  even these even people that aren't big in 9-11 truth will get involved just
[3:40:12.440 --> 3:40:15.880]  because they already dislike the school and they're already sick of the tyranny
[3:40:15.880 --> 3:40:20.600]  exactly that's the beauty of resistance it's exciting it's fun it's historical
[3:40:20.600 --> 3:40:24.800]  just you know I would call your group the sons of liberty and they already they
[3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:29.160]  already they already like they already dislike what's going on to them at school
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:34.280]  this gives them one more reason to you know kind of question the official story
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:38.320]  they question their beautiful they question the local police and now
[3:40:38.320 --> 3:40:41.720]  they question their government they see the big picture and they see that it's
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:45.400]  actually happening at local levels like the school but they know that it trickles
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:51.120]  on up to the federal government absolutely absolutely just beautiful
[3:40:51.120 --> 3:40:55.480]  what you're doing and again that like we're evil we're crazy because we want
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:40:58.840]  to speak out I wouldn't speak out in class I wouldn't erupt I'd speak out at
[3:40:58.840 --> 3:41:04.760]  lunch I'd speak out you know in between classes I would and see they
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:08.800]  understand counterculture so MTV says oh have purple hair I'm not saying purple
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:12.800]  hair is bad last week I said you know people are in their own niche cowboy hats
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:17.640]  you know golf outfits purple mohawks blue mohawks I'm not I don't care about
[3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:21.760]  cowboy hats or purple mohawks however your style is that's great but people make
[3:41:21.760 --> 3:41:26.640]  that style hip-hop outfits suits and ties whatever they make that who they are
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:31.640]  instead of what their psyches are and so I'm saying be liberty lovers be freedom
[3:41:31.640 --> 3:41:35.760]  fighters and realize that if we just take action we've got right on our side
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:40.040]  history on our side this new world order can't stand if more people do what
[3:41:40.040 --> 3:41:44.800]  Robert Wannick and others are doing so fantastic I also during the next break
[3:41:44.800 --> 3:41:48.000]  give us your address I'm in a million a hundred DVDs and a hundred bumper
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:51.480]  stickers maybe even more I just got to watch it we'll be out of business here
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:54.800]  pretty quick because our expenses are mounting and the economy's imploding but
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:59.200]  it doesn't matter now's the time to fight like never before because this is all
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:03.040]  imploding I want to take some phone calls for you but anything else Robert you
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:06.240]  want to add about what's happened to you I mean what's happened since you stood up
[3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:11.680]  you buck the system and now you the same thing happened eight years ago in
[3:42:11.680 --> 3:42:15.280]  Louisiana a world that daily broke the story was in local news as well and I
[3:42:15.280 --> 3:42:18.840]  remember having the students on they made them wear ID badges around their
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:21.920]  necks and the students learned that they could read the barcodes because barcode
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:25.960]  certain fatnesses you know are certain numbers so people learn that they could
[3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:29.240]  read their social security number and so the students said take the social
[3:42:29.240 --> 3:42:32.880]  security number off and they said no in school suspension for asking questions
[3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:37.320]  he refused then I think was 10 students refused then half the students
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:41.160]  refused they tried to kick the first students out of school the whole school
[3:42:41.160 --> 3:42:46.320]  had to pull the IDs out the slave badge numbers so so so we can do the same
[3:42:46.320 --> 3:42:52.400]  thing over and over again on other issues do they make you wear IDs no they
[3:42:52.400 --> 3:42:56.640]  don't make you wear IDs but they do have cameras right one thing yet cameras all
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:01.240]  of us go cameras on the ceiling cameras in the gym cameras right outside the
[3:43:01.240 --> 3:43:04.480]  bathroom you see when you're going to the bathroom when you're coming out every
[3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:08.960]  hallway all over the place even though we are a civil school and I'd like to
[3:43:08.960 --> 3:43:13.760]  mention something quick yesterday I made a trailer for a film idea I have called
[3:43:13.760 --> 3:43:19.360]  education indoctrination it's gotten 40,000 hits in one day and I'm asking
[3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:24.600]  students to mail or to send any activism videos at your school or on public 911
[3:43:24.600 --> 3:43:29.080]  truth or fighting the indoctrination whatever any pictures or videos you have
[3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:34.480]  handing out DVDs or flyers yes send them to 911 blogger at live.com and I'm
[3:43:34.480 --> 3:43:38.280]  going to compile them and I'm going to make a video of the youth fighting back
[3:43:38.280 --> 3:43:44.200]  beautiful absolutely and again folks it isn't just Robert Wannick it isn't just
[3:43:44.200 --> 3:43:48.760]  Alex Jones notice Robert Wannick isn't in fighting he isn't attacking certain
[3:43:48.760 --> 3:43:52.480]  groups he isn't obsessing on one point he is standing up for liberty and freedom
[3:43:52.480 --> 3:43:56.520]  which everybody agrees with and he's having huge success take enough respect
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:43:59.880]  and hundreds of other YouTube channels getting millions and millions of views
[3:43:59.880 --> 3:44:04.200]  and Robert is close to getting a million I know you've got some videos with 90,000
[3:44:04.200 --> 3:44:08.640]  people that have watched 100,000 have watched 50,000 have watched one day 40,000
[3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:12.200]  have watched that's why they're moving to shut down YouTube for free speech we've
[3:44:12.200 --> 3:44:16.520]  that's why Congress is having hearings about us and 911 truth I mean putting
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:20.720]  Richard Gage on the screen saying these are terrorists they might mean this is on
[3:44:20.720 --> 3:44:26.640]  C-Span because they know we're on to them they know we know they did the attacks
[3:44:26.640 --> 3:44:31.040]  they're criminals they've stolen 8.5 trillion they're openly threatened
[3:44:31.040 --> 3:44:35.120]  Congress with martial law Bloomberg financial reported the War Powers Act
[3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:38.200]  has been declared against Congress and they've been told the Federal Reserve
[3:44:38.200 --> 3:44:44.800]  now owns America this is a criminal fraud if we just say no to the fraud it
[3:44:44.800 --> 3:44:48.360]  will fall but if we let the establishment their suits and ties their little
[3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:52.800]  outfits act official and sell this on us they'll get away with it and be able to
[3:44:52.800 --> 3:44:55.680]  put troops on the streets and be able to keep killing people with it with the
[3:44:55.680 --> 3:44:59.000]  tasers and continue to put people in FEMA camps and get people in the system
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:04.480]  and ship their narcotics in to then break down our society we have to defeat
[3:45:04.480 --> 3:45:09.920]  this we have to fight it and I salute you Robert Wannick yes absolutely this is
[3:45:09.920 --> 3:45:13.720]  just fantastic you can also send those videos to the Alex Jones channel we're

[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:26.120]  story with you about 6th Street it was really happening and one little tiny
[3:46:26.120 --> 3:46:29.920]  thing with Jennifer Gale I know you say you don't pay attention to local news
[3:46:29.920 --> 3:46:35.400]  but here's a local hero who for years has been doing his political it more more
[3:46:35.400 --> 3:46:39.200]  than her share of political activity going to all the city council meetings I
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:42.200]  got to know her at the Travis County Commissioners Court meetings that I go
[3:46:42.200 --> 3:46:47.360]  to all the time now and she in spite of being she's born a man lived as a woman
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:51.240]  and was actually homeless she she fought all kinds of battles for you and me for
[3:46:51.240 --> 3:46:55.760]  all of us for the good of everybody have a better life here and she was
[3:46:55.760 --> 3:46:59.600]  constantly harassed and I think she was assassinated this was like a couple
[3:46:59.600 --> 3:47:04.520]  weeks ago wait a minute you mean that big guy yeah that's that same Jennifer
[3:47:04.520 --> 3:47:09.520]  Gale and she was assassinated she's younger than I am and she turned up
[3:47:09.520 --> 3:47:14.000]  dead suddenly and and I think it there needs to be an all right all right well
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:18.320]  look into that I appreciate your call I don't ignore the local stuff I've said
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:23.920]  I can't keep track of the international and national and so I'm criticized because
[3:47:23.920 --> 3:47:27.760]  people criticize anything who don't take action life for not being at more local
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:31.720]  stuff but then if I go to local stuff I get criticized like why is he here taking
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:35.800]  over the local stuff you know and so that's the that's not what I'm saying
[3:47:35.800 --> 3:47:39.520]  that's not what I'm doing you got a lot of folks that have moved into town who
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:44.200]  then their businesses to attack me and lie about me as a side issue I believe
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:48.760]  is an operation because they know Austin's a core and of resistance and so I
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:53.040]  just ignore all of that you know folks I'm under attack because I stand up for
[3:47:53.040 --> 3:47:56.520]  you when I lose freedom you lose freedom when you lose freedom I lose freedom
[3:47:56.520 --> 3:47:59.960]  when bad stuff happens to you I feel like it's happening to me because I know

[3:48:50.800 --> 3:48:54.760]  prison planet dot TV behind the scenes for viewers specifically what are you
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:48:57.080]  asking about gold international shipments I don't understand the
[3:48:57.080 --> 3:49:01.720]  question I'm on the coast right now there I hit that at least once a day
[3:49:01.720 --> 3:49:07.240]  does see what crew and everything is they have a cell cell price page and
[3:49:07.240 --> 3:49:14.440]  all their their small denomination coins are for shipment outside the US only if
[3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:17.760]  you want to buy gold you got to buy a large amount all right all right let me
[3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:21.640]  comment on that let me comment on that here we go you don't you know so we're
[3:49:21.640 --> 3:49:24.520]  congruent here I'm gonna answer his question when we come back to the full
[3:49:24.520 --> 3:49:28.800]  audience right now we're just on the internet streams at infowars.com and
[3:49:28.800 --> 3:49:32.840]  present planet dot TV I'll come back and answer that gold comment when we come
[3:49:32.840 --> 3:49:37.200]  back in the final full segment with the Aminoff of affiliates Michael in Idaho
[3:49:37.200 --> 3:49:40.240]  you're on the air go ahead
[3:49:41.400 --> 3:49:47.440]  again Michael we're on the air go ahead hey how you doing I want to thank that
[3:49:47.440 --> 3:49:53.720]  young man for all his hard work and I'll tell you right now we need more of them
[3:49:53.720 --> 3:49:59.120]  absolutely you know and I'm an armorer here in Idaho and stuff and you know and
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:03.480]  I remember way back when I was in high school and how they worked back then in
[3:50:03.480 --> 3:50:09.760]  Kansas and I'll tell you right now that things things do say stay the same but I
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:14.920]  might want to make a suggestion for him start a little study group outside of
[3:50:14.920 --> 3:50:20.520]  the school realm exactly start meeting at a local library and instead of taking
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:24.320]  drugs and partying what you're not doing do you know be the man you are they
[3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:26.840]  teach us to become men when we're 20 instead of being men when we're like
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:32.760]  12 well I meant toward a lot of young men in the service and our youth is our
[3:50:32.760 --> 3:50:37.560]  future and I'll tell you what right now that if we don't get ahold of our youth
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:41.840]  we lose our youth are falling apart because they don't have real missions
[3:50:41.840 --> 3:50:46.120]  they don't understand their destiny and how important they are they they aren't
[3:50:46.120 --> 3:50:49.760]  given the proper responsibilities early enough we're told to be a bunch of
[3:50:49.760 --> 3:50:53.360]  fools and so we never mature if somebody doesn't become a man by the time
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:57.480]  they're about 14 or 15 they probably never will the key is becoming a man
[3:50:57.480 --> 3:51:01.920]  early meant for the outside and for the outside study groups we do street
[3:51:01.920 --> 3:51:06.040]  actions we have youth here that do street actions I'm part of Minnesota change
[3:51:06.040 --> 3:51:10.640]  and if you're from Minnesota the cities or wherever you are go to mnchange.org
[3:51:10.640 --> 3:51:14.560]  send us an email and get involved we have kids here that no nine was an inside
[3:51:14.560 --> 3:51:18.160]  job they know that the establishment is scared they're running because we're not
[3:51:18.160 --> 3:51:22.240]  they're good little compliant slaves right and we know that the subjects that
[3:51:22.240 --> 3:51:26.280]  they're teaching us are completely saturated with propaganda all right
[3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:31.560]  when and that we won't watch TV and just be mesmerized exactly going back going
[3:51:31.560 --> 3:51:35.160]  back to the armorer what did you think of the breakdown of a Barack Obama I mean
[3:51:35.160 --> 3:51:39.440]  he is admittedly for gunbands we have his votes and then he and then he twisted
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:43.920]  says well I just want to be reasonable I'll tell you right now that within the
[3:51:43.920 --> 3:51:48.080]  body of of all the dealers that I know and within the military that in the
[3:51:48.080 --> 3:51:53.080]  men I know within the military they see his bull and the fat thing of it is one
[3:51:53.080 --> 3:51:56.680]  of the one of the biggest statements from the soldiers I know especially from the
[3:51:56.680 --> 3:52:02.360]  special forces is that they would never fire upon their own people and they
[3:52:02.360 --> 3:52:07.080]  support the Second Amendment and the Barack Obama is illegitimate in their
[3:52:07.080 --> 3:52:11.640]  eyes well that's why that's why they're trying to recruit foreigners in the
[3:52:11.640 --> 3:52:15.480]  biggest recruiting stations are in Manila and in eastern Europe and in
[3:52:15.480 --> 3:52:19.360]  Mexico City do you think that's going to get their game because here's the deal
[3:52:19.360 --> 3:52:22.720]  here let's go back to the full audience let's go back to the full audience here
[3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:29.080]  we go all right we're talking to Michael and Idaho I may have to go into
[3:52:29.080 --> 3:52:34.840]  overdrive here ladies and gentlemen I may have to continue the transmission let's
[3:52:34.840 --> 3:52:39.080]  just do five minutes in the next hour all right is that cool because I gotta go
[3:52:39.080 --> 3:52:46.280]  to a meeting in a minute Michael and Idaho is an armorer I've got some family
[3:52:46.280 --> 3:52:51.240]  one of them's an armorer but talking to folks and he's saying the special forces
[3:52:51.240 --> 3:52:54.720]  are saying they know it's New World Order they know it's illegitimate they're
[3:52:54.720 --> 3:52:58.160]  not going after the American people and I mentioned that's why the biggest army
[3:52:58.160 --> 3:53:02.560]  recruiting centers are in Mexico City Manila Philippines and in Eastern Europe
[3:53:02.560 --> 3:53:06.360]  places like Ukraine I mean they really are bringing in foreign troops but in
[3:53:06.360 --> 3:53:09.760]  the military itself and I saw a mainstream news article today I never
[3:53:09.760 --> 3:53:17.720]  got to this is out of the Army Times 2008 Army Times poll worry about Obama
[3:53:17.720 --> 3:53:22.840]  and it says the troops don't like Obama and don't trust him so that just
[3:53:22.840 --> 3:53:26.640]  seconds what you were just saying go ahead and finish up there is one thing
[3:53:26.640 --> 3:53:32.080]  I'd like to mention when Ron Paul was running and he on the when they had the
[3:53:32.080 --> 3:53:37.440]  massive donations and stuff around this time last year they cut off their
[3:53:37.440 --> 3:53:41.480]  communications so they could not use their credit cards and they were tech
[3:53:41.480 --> 3:53:45.000]  they were putting Ron Paul all over their tanks and everything else and in
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:49.720]  disrespect to their superiors good that was going on all over the place because
[3:53:49.720 --> 3:53:53.320]  they're superiors their superiors are bought and paid for by the New World
[3:53:53.320 --> 3:53:57.400]  Order this is not our government these are illegitimate foreign corporate
[3:53:57.400 --> 3:54:00.920]  raiders that have seized control of the executive are the special forces I know
[3:54:00.920 --> 3:54:05.480]  a lot of mar masking you aware that martial law has been declared over
[3:54:05.480 --> 3:54:10.040]  Congress and the War Powers Act has been implemented yes they are and one of the
[3:54:10.040 --> 3:54:13.920]  things that they have to keep their mouths kind of quiet and it's internal
[3:54:13.920 --> 3:54:18.680]  infiltration they're telling them what they want to want to hear they know a
[3:54:18.680 --> 3:54:22.760]  storm is coming and I can tell you right now that they're not going to get
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:28.680]  their game let one foreign troops or or any act of aggression to the citizen
[3:54:28.680 --> 3:54:32.720]  by the United States and there's going to be gear taken I can tell you well
[3:54:32.720 --> 3:54:36.280]  that's why they're going to fully implode the economy where the rioting and
[3:54:36.280 --> 3:54:42.040]  starving gets so bad that then you know I'll be at home with rioters wishing the
[3:54:42.040 --> 3:54:47.240]  army was there then the army comes in does a good job and sets the precedent
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:51.640]  that army can be on the streets then the real tyranny begins do they understand
[3:54:51.640 --> 3:54:55.640]  that well they do understand that but you know they also understand this game
[3:54:55.640 --> 3:54:59.520]  look when I'm a vet of the Cold War I was out in South America and I'll watch
[3:54:59.520 --> 3:55:05.640]  the same game go on okay and a lot of these other guys are older salts know
[3:55:05.640 --> 3:55:10.640]  what's going on and they're not going to get to that point I don't think they're
[3:55:10.640 --> 3:55:16.360]  going to do something stupid okay and it's just a waiting game as I as I see
[3:55:16.360 --> 3:55:21.720]  it the only thing that I hear is that a lot of the guys feel really cracking
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:26.440]  gears open and we're sitting around talking they feel little I don't know
[3:55:26.440 --> 3:55:30.280]  how to sit if they feel a little disappointed in the American people
[3:55:30.280 --> 3:55:33.920]  thinking that they would ever do these kind of things to the system bodies
[3:55:33.920 --> 3:55:37.560]  they're there well because the police are different the police have been
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:42.440]  trained and amongst us so long wait a minute on that I know a lot of police
[3:55:42.440 --> 3:55:46.880]  officers now you've got a lot of police officers playing the same game now

[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:56.560]  areas like here in Idaho and other places in Arizona and even in your area

[3:58:01.920 --> 3:58:05.360]  the troops in the military this isn't a drill or a game most countries get
[3:58:05.360 --> 3:58:08.960]  taken over by their militaries and police being controlled by a you know
[3:58:08.960 --> 3:58:12.240]  corrupt group generally offshore corporations offshore corporations come
[3:58:12.240 --> 3:58:17.000]  in they buy off governments they get control they loot the nations and that

[3:59:44.600 --> 3:59:48.560]  to add any other points you didn't have a chance to make well just like on the
[3:59:48.560 --> 3:59:52.280]  part where he's saying they're gonna make their their final stupid move and
[3:59:52.280 --> 3:59:56.480]  then people are gonna retaliate that might be a little too late for the last
[3:59:56.480 --> 4:00:01.280]  caller that's why we need to educate fellow man now with with Tara Storm and
[4:00:01.280 --> 4:00:06.280]  all these other DVDs that way when Barack Obama comes for our guns he's not
[4:00:06.280 --> 4:00:10.560]  taking them and we can't wait for them to make that final move everybody needs
[4:00:10.560 --> 4:00:14.440]  to be awake and we need to get them awake now well everybody knows it's an
[4:00:14.440 --> 4:00:18.880]  illegitimate foreign banker government they now admit it's world government we
[4:00:18.880 --> 4:00:22.040]  run the banks we're gonna create a new global currency where each of your
[4:00:22.040 --> 4:00:27.920]  currencies is controlled by us you'll pay carbon taxes to us and I mean I just

[4:03:24.600 --> 4:03:28.880]  make the money so we can keep people employed here but we're very effective
[4:03:28.880 --> 4:03:33.240]  don't bang for the buck what we're doing against the New World Order and the

[4:04:27.240 --> 4:04:31.240]  is ready because we it's been in some disarray so you're such a small
[4:04:31.240 --> 4:04:34.840]  operation and you're moving and doing all your regular work while you're at it
[4:04:34.840 --> 4:04:43.240]  and trying to hire more people it creates quite a cauldron of confusion but
[4:04:43.240 --> 4:04:48.040]  we will do that let's go ahead and talk to Bob in California you're on the air
[4:04:48.040 --> 4:04:54.040]  with our guests go ahead Bob hi Bob how you guys doing I'm from California I'm
[4:04:54.040 --> 4:05:02.800]  retired Air Force of that I also work at a base in California and I'm gonna try to
[4:05:02.800 --> 4:05:08.440]  start a group I live in the high desert California and I'm gonna try to start my
[4:05:08.440 --> 4:05:14.800]  own page regroup and doing some research and how to start it anyways I go to
[4:05:14.800 --> 4:05:22.400]  church and I know back in around 2000 they started they passed the pre-court
[4:05:22.400 --> 4:05:27.720]  pass whether you can have a religious group after school and they have what
[4:05:27.720 --> 4:05:32.000]  it's called the good news club and I church supports a couple of schools
[4:05:32.000 --> 4:05:36.320]  where they go to schools and they start the kids about the Bible about Jesus
[4:05:36.320 --> 4:05:43.520]  and all that so I don't know why he cannot start a group after school what
[4:05:43.520 --> 4:05:47.240]  you mentioned to him you know while people that are like minded like him
[4:05:47.240 --> 4:05:53.240]  that are against 9-11 what happened and and against the government for covering
[4:05:53.240 --> 4:06:00.400]  up all this stuff I know that he could start a group yeah and as you see
[4:06:00.400 --> 4:06:03.640]  there are more like-minded people we just had a student call in one of my
[4:06:03.640 --> 4:06:07.520]  better friends from my town I don't know if he had better reception but we had a
[4:06:07.520 --> 4:06:12.640]  student come in he's a junior at that school he's involved and when we get
[4:06:12.640 --> 4:06:15.960]  this new film about activism we're gonna hang in flyers up on the new class
[4:06:15.960 --> 4:06:20.400]  system that the students vigorously opposed and he'll be in that there'll
[4:06:20.400 --> 4:06:23.360]  be more students that you'll see in that and you'll just be introduced to a
[4:06:23.360 --> 4:06:27.000]  whole flurry of educated youth and you'll really be surprised at how
[4:06:27.000 --> 4:06:31.160]  educated people are at my school and how excited they are for change and they
[4:06:31.160 --> 4:06:34.120]  really want to affect it and we're not just gonna sit back it's good calling
[4:06:34.120 --> 4:06:37.120]  into shows and it's awesome what you're doing starting a paycheck group that's
[4:06:37.120 --> 4:06:40.040]  exactly what you do you need to take the next step and start that group and get
[4:06:40.040 --> 4:06:44.000]  out there so I really absolutely good to hear from you so as long as they don't
[4:06:44.000 --> 4:06:48.200]  as long as you don't have a teacher involved it has to be student involved
[4:06:48.200 --> 4:06:52.280]  only yeah all know these teachers don't want to get involved they don't want to
[4:06:52.280 --> 4:06:55.680]  they don't want to know I'm not of anybody that you have a clue you know
[4:06:55.680 --> 4:07:01.720]  the owner for you have a group it has to be led by the students period no no yeah
[4:07:01.720 --> 4:07:05.960]  because if you try to have school appropriation of school involved they
[4:07:05.960 --> 4:07:09.000]  will then try to say they have control over appreciate the call great points
[4:07:09.000 --> 4:07:14.160]  let's talk to Michael in mass you're on the air with our guest
[4:07:14.160 --> 4:07:20.080]  hey how's it going guys Robert let me just first of all I'll say you're an
[4:07:20.080 --> 4:07:24.040]  inspiration man I'm 24 years old and I think back when I was in high school I
[4:07:24.040 --> 4:07:28.440]  just wish that about some of the stuff that you are now our young people need
[4:07:28.440 --> 4:07:31.640]  real purpose and fighting the globalist who are destroying our country
[4:07:31.640 --> 4:07:34.760]  destroying our Bill of Rights I mean this is the calling be part of history
[4:07:34.760 --> 4:07:38.960]  now and young people take a camera to school be polite hand out 9-11 truth
[4:07:38.960 --> 4:07:42.760]  DVDs hand out bumper stickers hand out materials and when they try to stop you
[4:07:42.760 --> 4:07:47.520]  doing that put that on YouTube put that on live link put that on blip TV put
[4:07:47.520 --> 4:07:51.920]  that out on my space all of us imagine millions of young people taking action
[4:07:51.920 --> 4:07:55.480]  nothing will stop it that's why Obama wants the youth corps they want to
[4:07:55.480 --> 4:07:59.520]  control the youth with their communist socialist fascist command and control we
[4:07:59.520 --> 4:08:03.640]  have to have an organic true grassroots resistance to them and it's out there and
[4:08:03.640 --> 4:08:16.440]  it's going on and this is the key sure sure can we boost his audio because I'm
[4:08:16.440 --> 4:08:19.440]  having trouble here in the car go ahead sure I'm sorry let me let me get close to
[4:08:19.440 --> 4:08:25.360]  my phone when I was in high school I had a little altercation it was right after
[4:08:25.360 --> 4:08:29.280]  Columbine and to give you a little background I'm a pretty bombastic
[4:08:29.280 --> 4:08:32.760]  person I speak my mind you know what I mean and I used to always give the
[4:08:32.760 --> 4:08:36.480]  faculty a hard time I mean when I was in high school they had just implemented
[4:08:36.480 --> 4:08:40.040]  that ID program that you were just talking about and you know that was a
[4:08:40.040 --> 4:08:43.800]  big cause for contra nation I said you know go on and on about it you know
[4:08:43.800 --> 4:08:48.360]  deeply to go with the way he's crazy you know what not you know because it's
[4:08:48.360 --> 4:08:51.480]  right during that Columbine time that's what they do anybody who doesn't like
[4:08:51.480 --> 4:08:55.560]  the police state wants that's what Biden said in that clip I played where a guy
[4:08:55.560 --> 4:08:58.520]  said please don't take my guns and Biden said oh my god your guns need to be
[4:08:58.520 --> 4:09:03.680]  confiscated don't come shoot me yeah the faculty of the school he is on this as
[4:09:03.680 --> 4:09:09.600]  if it was like an opportunity to bring me into the office stage the event involved
[4:09:09.600 --> 4:09:14.840]  they said and it was totally it was totally ridiculous like cartoonish how
[4:09:14.840 --> 4:09:21.240]  completely sir every week I see about some high school student English writes a
[4:09:21.240 --> 4:09:25.800]  story about their dad is in the Marines or writes a story about zombies

[4:09:29.400 --> 4:09:37.440]  I got an A on you know that was 20 years ago and and they now come and arrest you
[4:09:37.440 --> 4:09:41.480]  for that and say it's a murder plot again for what you write the students are
[4:09:41.480 --> 4:09:44.680]  being taught there's no First Amendment even in the articles they write even
[4:09:44.680 --> 4:09:48.840]  articles that don't mention the school don't mention any students the last guy
[4:09:48.840 --> 4:09:52.800]  that got arrested that I read about in charge of attempted murder he wrote a
[4:09:52.800 --> 4:09:57.360]  story about a fictitious school with zombies he was a straight-A student and
[4:09:57.360 --> 4:10:01.040]  and and and you know they said write a fiction story so he wrote a story about

[4:10:30.920 --> 4:10:37.120]  situations that one word of advice I can give him is temper your reason do not
[4:10:37.120 --> 4:10:43.240]  flip out if you put forward a unified and coherent thesis opposing what they're
[4:10:43.240 --> 4:10:47.200]  trying to say to you they'll have nothing and also they'll be proud of it like
[4:10:47.200 --> 4:10:49.840]  Alex says you know these people are compartmentalized they don't even really
[4:10:49.840 --> 4:10:53.520]  realize what they're doing so if you show them that you're intelligent and you
[4:10:53.520 --> 4:10:58.440]  know what you're saying you'll be able to combat the propaganda that the
[4:10:58.440 --> 4:11:02.840]  yeah but we don't we won't definitely not give into their instigation with
[4:11:02.840 --> 4:11:07.280]  violence or anything because we see that these situations that they instigate
[4:11:07.280 --> 4:11:12.000]  they cause are fraudulent that's what we stay calm we say we haven't done
[4:11:12.000 --> 4:11:16.320]  anything wrong but they calm and that's how pages do we do it peacefully all
[4:11:16.320 --> 4:11:18.560]  right but you know when I was your age

[4:16:28.680 --> 4:16:33.000]  warfare on us and it's not babble as long as we're giving out this
[4:16:33.000 --> 4:16:38.000]  information you could talk all day and because it's just it's just such
[4:16:38.000 --> 4:16:41.800]  important stuff that needs to get out there and when people come out and say
[4:16:41.800 --> 4:16:46.600]  you guys are just info Alex don't just info he lied hold on hold on hold on
[4:16:46.600 --> 4:16:50.760]  just a second I agree with you stay there with they found it and pulled it up
[4:16:50.760 --> 4:16:55.120]  live on air go back go back to the YouTube main page let's take our lower
[4:16:55.120 --> 4:16:58.600]  third up or people will say it's fake they're preconditioned by enemy
[4:16:58.600 --> 4:17:01.240]  brainwashing everyone's been preconditioned we have to break break
[4:17:01.240 --> 4:17:03.960]  your conditioning right now you can do this this is real this is happening
[4:17:03.960 --> 4:17:07.400]  everywhere okay I can even find them throwing blood on kids they scream and
[4:17:07.400 --> 4:17:12.920]  cry okay fake blood now now now go back to the main page of YouTube and then all
[4:17:12.920 --> 4:17:17.400]  you type in is goose Creek drug raid South Carolina and then the first thing
[4:17:17.400 --> 4:17:23.160]  that comes up is this video shot by somebody in the school the footage I've
[4:17:23.160 --> 4:17:26.200]  seen from up from the cameras in the school themselves here it is punch it
[4:17:26.200 --> 4:17:55.320]  up on your screen now
[4:17:57.160 --> 4:18:03.600]  all right that's not the one the one I want is mounted up on the ceiling I guess
[4:18:03.600 --> 4:18:06.920]  that was some subpoenaed cop video that they shot themselves and they go to the
[4:18:06.920 --> 4:18:11.640]  whole school and they do this every week until the people complain and
[4:18:11.640 --> 4:18:15.280]  there's footage of them going you got drugs and the dog goes up and grabs the
[4:18:15.280 --> 4:18:19.240]  bag and starts ripping and the child's going oh my god oh my god no and of
[4:18:19.240 --> 4:18:22.760]  course no drugs were ever found so they did raid after raid for using the dogs
[4:18:22.760 --> 4:18:27.960]  as an Abu Ghraib torture tactic which the army trains people in this now in
[4:18:27.960 --> 4:18:31.400]  interrogation so that's why these aren't former army soldiers do this and
[4:18:31.400 --> 4:18:35.560]  remember Abu Ghraib with the dogs so this is Abu Ghraib in America and then
[4:18:35.560 --> 4:18:39.440]  when this surfaced four or five years ago all these other Abu Ghraib videos of
[4:18:39.440 --> 4:18:44.040]  the dogs attacking Robert Wannick go ahead and make your point and they're
[4:18:44.040 --> 4:18:48.120]  just trying to get us ready there's why are they doing this it's conditioning
[4:18:48.120 --> 4:18:52.280]  it's getting it drilled into your head that when these men in black coms they
[4:18:52.280 --> 4:18:57.840]  could stop will come they marched on the streets with their Robert I lost you
[4:18:57.840 --> 4:19:02.440]  please continue okay um what they're doing this for is just to condition us
[4:19:02.440 --> 4:19:05.840]  get us ready so that when these when this could stop will come down the street
[4:19:05.840 --> 4:19:09.040]  with their machine guns pointing their guns in your face getting their dogs
[4:19:09.040 --> 4:19:13.480]  out they you know just bow down give up your civil liberties we will keep you
[4:19:13.480 --> 4:19:18.680]  safe when in return they're gonna they're gonna reduce the population and
[4:19:18.680 --> 4:19:24.560]  this isn't about security it's about power control and everything the economy
[4:19:24.560 --> 4:19:28.400]  the indoctrination of schools you know you heard that Marine call a few days
[4:19:28.400 --> 4:19:31.720]  ago did you hear the Marine call and of course I don't believe I mean I believe
[4:19:31.720 --> 4:19:35.360]  him but only because I already know it they teach the Marines and psych warfare
[4:19:35.360 --> 4:19:39.320]  the higher-level officer corps learned helplessness where they torture a puppy
[4:19:39.320 --> 4:19:45.160]  in a in a in a a electrocution pit yeah and and and again they're teaching the
[4:19:45.160 --> 4:19:48.520]  Marines how to create learned helplessness and that's what this is for
[4:19:48.520 --> 4:19:52.520]  the students and we have government documents to train them to be helpless
[4:19:52.520 --> 4:19:56.600]  and to learn when they see a black uniform to just go and just submit so
[4:19:56.600 --> 4:20:00.200]  they drill the children getting on buses having handcuffs put on them have
[4:20:00.200 --> 4:20:04.120]  dogs growl at them they lock the kids up and make them defecate on themselves
[4:20:04.120 --> 4:20:08.840]  with no food or water locked up for eight hours this is done nationwide and the
[4:20:08.840 --> 4:20:12.600]  parents are so brainwashed they'll complain the school go what's wrong with
[4:20:12.600 --> 4:20:16.000]  you are you insane we have to do this to stop Columbine and al-Qaeda attacking
[4:20:16.000 --> 4:20:21.640]  schools yeah and they want to say don't listen to the Alex Jones don't listen to
[4:20:21.640 --> 4:20:25.680]  these other patriot groups we're not the terrorist police and government aren't
[4:20:25.680 --> 4:20:29.640]  terrorist it's the big bad terrorist that never show up to the al-Qaeda these
[4:20:29.640 --> 4:20:33.480]  boogeymen that they have by the way I just found a really I just found a
[4:20:33.480 --> 4:20:36.920]  really evil clip that I'd forgotten about click on the Miami police shot
[4:20:36.920 --> 4:20:40.520]  protester then laugh about it I've talked about this video just when they
[4:20:40.520 --> 4:20:44.000]  shoot her in the head through a fine and then laugh about it she's peace and
[4:20:44.000 --> 4:20:50.020]  say all that you got it you got a good rate mad here here here faded up we'll
[4:20:50.020 --> 4:20:53.520]  go ahead and punch Elizabeth Ritter received some media coverage three years
[4:20:53.520 --> 4:20:58.280]  ago in a free trade protest when she was shot with rubber bullets in the back and
[4:20:58.280 --> 4:21:00.680]  a leg
[4:21:00.680 --> 4:21:02.680]  Did you shoot me?
[4:21:02.680 --> 4:21:04.680]  Did you shoot me?
[4:21:04.680 --> 4:21:05.680]  Yes.
[4:21:05.680 --> 4:21:07.680]  Lady in a suit?
[4:21:07.680 --> 4:21:09.680]  If you walk in peace of law, turn to you.
[4:21:09.680 --> 4:21:11.680]  Perhaps I'll be shot from my back.
[4:21:11.680 --> 4:21:14.680]  Her beef wasn't with the trade summit,
[4:21:14.680 --> 4:21:16.680]  but with a strong police presence.
[4:21:16.680 --> 4:21:17.680]  Look at him.
[4:21:17.680 --> 4:21:19.680]  Minutes later, she took another rubber bullet
[4:21:19.680 --> 4:21:22.680]  on her forehead as she crouched behind her
[4:21:22.680 --> 4:21:24.680]  homemade sign that read,
[4:21:24.680 --> 4:21:26.680]  Fear Totalitarianism.
[4:21:26.680 --> 4:21:27.680]  You okay?
[4:21:27.680 --> 4:21:30.680]  Don't get around me. Let's go and see it.
[4:21:30.680 --> 4:21:32.680]  Get her in the face!
[4:21:32.680 --> 4:21:36.680]  Now her case is back in the news because of this.
[4:21:36.680 --> 4:21:39.680]  The good news about being able to watch you guys live on TV
[4:21:39.680 --> 4:21:42.680]  is that lady with the red dress.
[4:21:42.680 --> 4:21:46.680]  A police video shot after the shooting incident
[4:21:46.680 --> 4:21:50.680]  just released following a review of excessive force complaints
[4:21:50.680 --> 4:21:52.680]  at the protest.
[4:21:52.680 --> 4:21:55.680]  I don't know who got her, but let me know.
[4:21:55.680 --> 4:21:58.680]  When it went through the sign, it hit her smack dab,
[4:21:58.680 --> 4:22:00.680]  and it went out.
[4:22:00.680 --> 4:22:06.680]  Attorney Ritter says she was too scared to file a complaint before,
[4:22:06.680 --> 4:22:10.680]  but now she intends to sue for excessive force.
[4:22:10.680 --> 4:22:12.680]  I was cowering with a poster behind me,
[4:22:12.680 --> 4:22:14.680]  but my fingers were in front of the poster.
[4:22:14.680 --> 4:22:17.680]  I believe they thought that my face would have reasonably concluded
[4:22:17.680 --> 4:22:19.680]  that my face was behind that poster,
[4:22:19.680 --> 4:22:21.680]  and that's why they fired that shot.
[4:22:21.680 --> 4:22:25.680]  The Broward Sheriff's Office says Ritter's possible civil rights lawsuit
[4:22:25.680 --> 4:22:28.680]  prevents them from talking specifics.
[4:22:28.680 --> 4:22:32.680]  Officers at the Seantel CNN, they warned the crowd to move back.
[4:22:32.680 --> 4:22:34.680]  All right, let's stop right there.
[4:22:34.680 --> 4:22:36.680]  Let me explain something, cops.
[4:22:36.680 --> 4:22:39.680]  You've been dehumanized. You think you've dehumanized us.
[4:22:39.680 --> 4:22:42.680]  When you dehumanize us, you've dehumanized yourself, your children,
[4:22:42.680 --> 4:22:43.680]  your whole future line.
[4:22:43.680 --> 4:22:46.680]  And when they get in this gang mentality, the cop commanders,
[4:22:46.680 --> 4:22:52.680]  it's a good old boys' club, and the police unions will kick
[4:22:52.680 --> 4:22:55.680]  any good police chiefs out that try to get control over them.
[4:22:55.680 --> 4:22:57.680]  So I've watched a lot of police training videos.
[4:22:57.680 --> 4:23:00.680]  The commanders kiss the butt of all the little cops,
[4:23:00.680 --> 4:23:03.680]  and then they all feed on each other,
[4:23:03.680 --> 4:23:05.680]  and they're hatred and disdain for the public,
[4:23:05.680 --> 4:23:07.680]  especially in Miami.
[4:23:07.680 --> 4:23:10.680]  A federal judge was out there at a previous event in Miami
[4:23:10.680 --> 4:23:13.680]  going to their car, and the cops cornered them and beat them down,
[4:23:13.680 --> 4:23:15.680]  and they lost a big suit over that,
[4:23:15.680 --> 4:23:16.680]  because they didn't know.
[4:23:16.680 --> 4:23:18.680]  They thought they were going to have a little fun on a side street
[4:23:18.680 --> 4:23:21.680]  with a judge and went to, I mean, just beat the person almost to death,
[4:23:21.680 --> 4:23:23.680]  and they got a lot of trouble for that,
[4:23:23.680 --> 4:23:26.680]  but that was because that was a real citizen, a God-level person,
[4:23:26.680 --> 4:23:29.680]  you know, above them in the government, not a slave scum
[4:23:29.680 --> 4:23:31.680]  that's, you know, just here to be stomped on.
[4:23:31.680 --> 4:23:33.680]  And so that's why when I'm driving down the road,
[4:23:33.680 --> 4:23:35.680]  and there's lanes on both sides of me, Austin cop, no lights on,
[4:23:35.680 --> 4:23:37.680]  just run right up behind you with pleasure.
[4:23:37.680 --> 4:23:41.680]  Just, just, just, just, and then swing around and almost hit you,
[4:23:41.680 --> 4:23:44.680]  and then just sit there with the light in your face going,
[4:23:44.680 --> 4:23:49.680]  you son of a bitch citizen, you are slave, civilian, I rule you,
[4:23:49.680 --> 4:23:51.680]  and if I want to shoot you in the face with rubber bullets,
[4:23:51.680 --> 4:23:54.680]  you know, that girl at the Red Sox game came out of a bar,
[4:23:54.680 --> 4:23:57.680]  they shot her in the face 10 feet away, blew her eyeball back in her brain,
[4:23:57.680 --> 4:23:59.680]  she bled to death, the cops went on the news and said,
[4:23:59.680 --> 4:24:01.680]  she shouldn't have been out there.
[4:24:01.680 --> 4:24:03.680]  Death, death, death.
[4:24:03.680 --> 4:24:06.680]  Hey, don't worry, the bankers are going to take everything you got, cops.
[4:24:06.680 --> 4:24:09.680]  You think you can just deal death on us and deal pain on us?
[4:24:09.680 --> 4:24:12.680]  You don't think there aren't bigger devils above you in the New World Order
[4:24:12.680 --> 4:24:13.680]  that'll have their way with you?
[4:24:13.680 --> 4:24:15.680]  You think you're safe from evil?
[4:24:15.680 --> 4:24:19.680]  We have liberty and freedom and we're, look at that famous photo.
[4:24:19.680 --> 4:24:23.680]  That was in Oregon, that woman, they said no protest,
[4:24:23.680 --> 4:24:26.680]  she was peacefully with a sign and there's video of that on the web
[4:24:26.680 --> 4:24:29.680]  and they just start choking her till she passes out.
[4:24:29.680 --> 4:24:35.680]  Just men in black uniforms grabbing a 55-year-old woman just choking her.
[4:24:35.680 --> 4:24:40.680]  You're going to learn who we are, you're going to learn to submit
[4:24:40.680 --> 4:24:43.680]  the foreign bankers have given us unlimited power
[4:24:43.680 --> 4:24:45.680]  and we're going to rule you.
[4:24:45.680 --> 4:24:47.680]  This is our country.
[4:24:47.680 --> 4:24:50.680]  Ah, you're here, we're going to feed on your ass.
[4:24:50.680 --> 4:24:52.680]  And the cops just drink fluoride water.
[4:24:52.680 --> 4:24:54.680]  They take their kids and just shoot them up with mercury
[4:24:54.680 --> 4:24:57.680]  and the kids become autistic, the cops don't care.
[4:24:57.680 --> 4:25:00.680]  They're, I'm going to the tip bar, I don't care if my kids brain damaged
[4:25:00.680 --> 4:25:04.680]  and they drink whiskey and wreck and kill everybody in Austin
[4:25:04.680 --> 4:25:06.680]  and then when they wreck and kill themselves,
[4:25:06.680 --> 4:25:08.680]  the cops then go and swat team the bar owners
[4:25:08.680 --> 4:25:10.680]  that sold them too much whiskey.
[4:25:10.680 --> 4:25:13.680]  It's your fault you sold too much whiskey to a God.
[4:25:13.680 --> 4:25:16.680]  You don't sell too much whiskey to a God.
[4:25:16.680 --> 4:25:17.680]  We're God.
[4:25:17.680 --> 4:25:20.680]  You understand we rule America.
[4:25:20.680 --> 4:25:23.680]  We'll shoot you in the face, we'll bloody your face
[4:25:23.680 --> 4:25:27.680]  and we'll laugh about it because we're weak gang members.
[4:25:27.680 --> 4:25:30.680]  You look at those men, go back to the video where the cops laugh
[4:25:30.680 --> 4:25:32.680]  and look how soft they are.
[4:25:32.680 --> 4:25:35.680]  Look how their eyes don't have any electric liberty in them.
[4:25:35.680 --> 4:25:38.680]  Look at how soft they are. Look at how disgusting they are.
[4:25:38.680 --> 4:25:40.680]  And you can see a few of the cops in there
[4:25:40.680 --> 4:25:42.680]  are looking like they're not having fun.
[4:25:42.680 --> 4:25:44.680]  And if you look at their faces, they look human.
[4:25:44.680 --> 4:25:46.680]  They look like they still have a soul.
[4:25:46.680 --> 4:25:48.680]  Back it up to them laughing.
[4:25:54.680 --> 4:25:57.680]  Now her case is back in the news because of this.
[4:25:57.680 --> 4:26:00.680]  The good news about being, being able to watch you guys
[4:26:00.680 --> 4:26:05.680]  live on TV as that lady with the red dress.
[4:26:05.680 --> 4:26:08.680]  A police video shot after the shooting incident
[4:26:08.680 --> 4:26:12.680]  just released following a review of excessive force complaints
[4:26:12.680 --> 4:26:14.680]  at the protest.
[4:26:14.680 --> 4:26:17.680]  Hit pause. Hit pause. That one's soft right there.
[4:26:17.680 --> 4:26:20.680]  That guy joined the force because I guarantee you
[4:26:20.680 --> 4:26:23.680]  he's the type of guy that bullied kids that were smaller than him
[4:26:23.680 --> 4:26:26.680]  than those kids grew up and kicked his ass.
[4:26:26.680 --> 4:26:29.680]  I know those types. I've seen that face.
[4:26:29.680 --> 4:26:31.680]  And now they love it.
[4:26:31.680 --> 4:26:34.680]  They can abuse and beat up everybody and nobody can stop them.
[4:26:34.680 --> 4:26:37.680]  Nobody can stop them. They're having their way with America.
[4:26:37.680 --> 4:26:39.680]  They want our guns.
[4:26:39.680 --> 4:26:41.680]  And if you're not with them cops and military,
[4:26:41.680 --> 4:26:44.680]  then you will declare that you're with the Republic now.
[4:26:44.680 --> 4:26:47.680]  And don't tell me that I'm a weirdo because I'm upset about this
[4:26:47.680 --> 4:26:50.680]  and I should only go get upset about my favorite football team winning or losing.
[4:26:50.680 --> 4:26:52.680]  Listen, I know what tyranny means.
[4:26:52.680 --> 4:26:54.680]  I know the bankers are putting poison in our food and water.
[4:26:54.680 --> 4:26:57.680]  I know the bankers have stolen 8.5 trillion.
[4:26:57.680 --> 4:26:59.680]  I know we're under War Powers Act.
[4:26:59.680 --> 4:27:02.680]  I know they're hurting us. I know they're carrying out New World Order.
[4:27:02.680 --> 4:27:04.680]  I know they staged those terror attacks.
[4:27:04.680 --> 4:27:07.680]  You know what it's like to gut up to this and go out every day
[4:27:07.680 --> 4:27:11.680]  and go past the peer pressure and come out day one and say 9-11 was an inside job
[4:27:11.680 --> 4:27:13.680]  and lose most of the radio stations I was on.
[4:27:13.680 --> 4:27:15.680]  You know what it's like to go to sleep every night
[4:27:15.680 --> 4:27:17.680]  knowing you work for a bunch of psychotic killers
[4:27:17.680 --> 4:27:20.680]  and you bastards are probably going to end up killing me one day.
[4:27:20.680 --> 4:27:22.680]  You know what it's like knowing you've ruined my life.
[4:27:22.680 --> 4:27:24.680]  You know what it's like, you sons of bitches.
[4:27:24.680 --> 4:27:26.680]  I'm tired of your crap.
[4:27:26.680 --> 4:27:28.680]  You commit evil. You're part of an evil system.
[4:27:28.680 --> 4:27:30.680]  And we're standing up against you.
[4:27:30.680 --> 4:27:33.680]  And the Republic is going to defeat you in the end.
[4:27:33.680 --> 4:27:35.680]  Some of us won't make it personally through this.
[4:27:35.680 --> 4:27:37.680]  But a lot of us are.
[4:27:37.680 --> 4:27:39.680]  And in the end, you are going to be brought to justice
[4:27:39.680 --> 4:27:41.680]  for all the kids you've kidnapped for CPS.
[4:27:41.680 --> 4:27:43.680]  All you CPS workers.
[4:27:43.680 --> 4:27:44.680]  All you corrupt bureaucrats.
[4:27:44.680 --> 4:27:47.680]  All of you that have had your way with innocent children over and over again
[4:27:47.680 --> 4:27:49.680]  and who think your evil's invincible.
[4:27:49.680 --> 4:27:50.680]  You're not invincible.
[4:27:50.680 --> 4:27:52.680]  And God is going to deal with you.
[4:27:52.680 --> 4:27:56.680]  And you are cursed to hell.
[4:27:56.680 --> 4:27:58.680]  I'm done. I got to get out of here.
[4:27:58.680 --> 4:27:59.680]  I'm pissed off now.
[4:27:59.680 --> 4:28:01.680]  Robert Wannick, you can make some closing comments.
[4:28:01.680 --> 4:28:03.680]  I'll give you the last two minutes.
[4:28:03.680 --> 4:28:04.680]  We're going to end transmission.
[4:28:04.680 --> 4:28:06.680]  Make sure the guys got your address so I can send you those videos
[4:28:06.680 --> 4:28:08.680]  so you can resist tyranny.
[4:28:08.680 --> 4:28:10.680]  I salute you.
[4:28:10.680 --> 4:28:14.680]  You know, these police, they don't know that they're pawns in the New World Order.
[4:28:14.680 --> 4:28:16.680]  They think they are the highest up.
[4:28:16.680 --> 4:28:18.680]  And that's why they bully us.
[4:28:18.680 --> 4:28:19.680]  But they don't understand.
[4:28:19.680 --> 4:28:21.680]  They are no better than us.
[4:28:21.680 --> 4:28:24.680]  The government thinks they are slaves just like us.
[4:28:24.680 --> 4:28:26.680]  They are dirt to the government just like we are.
[4:28:26.680 --> 4:28:27.680]  And they understand.
[4:28:27.680 --> 4:28:31.680]  They either fight with us or we're going to have to fight them.
[4:28:31.680 --> 4:28:34.680]  So visit us over at nwoalert.com.
[4:28:34.680 --> 4:28:37.680]  That's nwoalert.com.

[4:28:46.680 --> 4:28:49.680]  And we're going to use information warfare with sites like info wars.
[4:28:49.680 --> 4:28:51.680]  And we're not going to let these police oppress us.
[4:28:51.680 --> 4:28:56.680]  And we're not going to let ourselves be abused psychologically and physically by the system.
[4:28:56.680 --> 4:28:58.680]  And we're going to keep them running scared.
[4:28:58.680 --> 4:29:00.680]  And we're going to bring sovereignty back.
[4:29:00.680 --> 4:29:07.680]  And the USA is going to be what it was and what the founding fathers envisioned.
[4:29:07.680 --> 4:29:15.680]  But if you're a student, I really strongly urge you to send any pics, videos, anything you can get.
[4:29:15.680 --> 4:29:19.680]  Even camera, audio, of you being oppressed at your school.
[4:29:19.680 --> 4:29:24.680]  You're going to need to send them to 9-ElevenBlobbyRatLive.com.

[4:29:33.680 --> 4:29:35.680]  Send us the full name of your school.
[4:29:35.680 --> 4:29:36.680]  High school, college, whatever.
[4:29:36.680 --> 4:29:38.680]  And send us your personal last name.
[4:29:38.680 --> 4:29:39.680]  We'll put you in the video.

[4:29:41.680 --> 4:29:43.680]  I don't care how much it costs to burn the DVDs.
[4:29:43.680 --> 4:29:45.680]  We're going to give you copies for free.
[4:30:13.680 --> 4:30:15.680]  We're going to get you on YouTube.
