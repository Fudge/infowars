[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  It was now two years ago. Time certainly flies by very quickly. But I began airing almost
[00:16.000 --> 00:23.720]  every broadcast with an air raid siren. In my 27 years on air, at that point 25 years
[00:23.720 --> 00:31.200]  on air, I might have started a dozen broadcasts with air raid sirens to note the particular
[00:31.200 --> 00:36.360]  historic nature of danger against America and humanity in general. Kind of like Matt
[00:36.360 --> 00:42.120]  Grudge would occasionally a couple of times a year have a red flashing siren. But as we
[00:42.120 --> 00:49.120]  entered into the globalist going from beta into operational, I began to play the air
[00:49.120 --> 00:54.240]  raid siren at the start of pretty much every broadcast. And that's where we are right now.
[00:54.240 --> 00:59.360]  Boy, are we in the thick of it. But humanity is striking back. There is not just evil in
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.320]  the universe. There is also good. There is evil. There is good. But there is also those
[01:04.320 --> 01:11.800]  that try to stay neutral and try to just hide. And God says you were neither hot nor cold.
[01:11.800 --> 01:18.560]  Luke warms so I spit you out of my mouth. It is not a good place in my view to be neutral
[01:18.560 --> 01:26.000]  when it comes to pretty much any subject or topic in the world. But it is hard to do when
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  it is other people's fights, when it is an ongoing trouble conflict that you have been
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.840]  drug into. Like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we had a very important two hour plus debate
[01:36.840 --> 01:41.880]  last night. Most people, the vast majority, were very positive, thought it was good. Some
[01:41.880 --> 01:45.760]  wanted to hear more of Barnes, some wanted to hear more of Foyntez. But you definitely
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.680]  got to hear the topic that people don't want on air and that is highly censored. You can't
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.200]  debate that and that's the criticism of Israel, which I think people have every right to engage
[01:55.200 --> 02:01.080]  in if that's their view. But you also have some of the anti-Israel folks that really
[02:01.080 --> 02:06.440]  hate anybody that doesn't agree with their view. So it's quite the mess. But it was a
[02:06.440 --> 02:11.480]  very good debate and we posted the archive of the debate to Band on Video. It's also
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.720]  now on the front page of infowars.com. We've cut out the two hour debate by itself and
[02:16.720 --> 02:22.600]  you have our intro to it and then the hour, so we did after it, posted in full the debate
[02:22.600 --> 02:28.640]  as well. So one version is three hours and 15 minutes long. One version is roughly two
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.760]  hours long. We had about a million people tuning into the different live streams and
[02:32.760 --> 02:37.480]  since we posted it last night, 81,000 people have watched the one clip, a couple hundred
[02:37.480 --> 02:42.480]  thousand have watched the other. So I hope that you will want to share those archives
[02:42.480 --> 02:49.880]  that are now posted at Band on Video. Okay, let's move past that now. We have several
[02:49.880 --> 02:56.360]  big guests today and I'll also be hosting the fourth hour where we will then play some
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.520]  clips from last night's debate and open the phones up on the subject of the Middle East
[03:01.520 --> 03:08.680]  crisis, which is important, but also really becomes a proxy war between different battling
[03:08.680 --> 03:13.280]  forces and you've got the globalist up there manipulating both sides in almost every case.
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.440]  That's my view. The history bears that out. We'll be talking about that coming up on the
[03:19.440 --> 03:25.120]  fourth hour of the transmission. Now that said, wow, if you look at the headline for
[03:25.120 --> 03:33.280]  today's live show, it's that the deep state is in very, very deep trouble. Fauci and Gates
[03:33.280 --> 03:40.360]  and others are going down. You saw that start about three weeks ago, even before Gates's
[03:40.360 --> 03:45.200]  political beard and not a sexual beard, but a beard for the fact that he isn't really
[03:45.200 --> 03:53.000]  married, his fake wife, I guess his concubine, you could say. Even before that happened,
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.960]  I said Gates is going down. I'd seen the signs and now you've seen the system turn
[03:56.960 --> 04:02.240]  on him. If you know why they turned on him, you understand everything. And I said, following
[04:02.240 --> 04:07.920]  that will be Fauci and either they get in big trouble and get politically destroyed and
[04:07.920 --> 04:12.720]  more importantly, go to prison or the globalists continue to launch bio attacks and hold the
[04:12.720 --> 04:18.760]  planet hostage for their particular brand of globalism. The reason this is coming out
[04:18.760 --> 04:23.200]  is there's different camps in the New World Order and Gates and China went ahead and tried
[04:23.200 --> 04:28.000]  to take over. Now, when the more powerful secret of camp of the New World Order wants
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.840]  a long, slow takeover and not a fast one. So there's some interactions battling. That's
[04:33.840 --> 04:38.640]  why this is all happening. You'll get tomorrow's news today when we come back. Such a huge
[04:38.640 --> 04:43.560]  broadcast today. First clip will play as Senator Rand Paul says Fauci absolutely committed
[04:43.560 --> 04:48.840]  surgery over on funding denial. We'll hit that first and then they're getting the indictments
[04:48.840 --> 04:54.720]  ready against Trump in New York. That's official. All right. So Leticia James Soros is a general
[04:54.720 --> 05:03.560]  is preparing to punish the former president. We're launching our 2021 Memorial week specials.
[05:03.560 --> 05:08.800]  And right now we've got store wet free shipping. We've got double Patriot points. We've got

[06:13.640 --> 06:37.240]  It for wars. Tomorrow's news today live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide is
[06:37.240 --> 06:56.040]  Alex Jones. I'm not someone that gets intimidated easily or that gets butterflies, but we are
[06:56.040 --> 07:05.520]  standing at the crossroads of human destiny. The crossroads of human history right now
[07:05.520 --> 07:11.480]  and fortune favors the bold. The fortune I seek is human liberty and freedom and a better
[07:11.480 --> 07:19.000]  relationship with God and more knowledge and more peace. The globalists seek to be God.
[07:19.000 --> 07:27.520]  They seek total control. Thank you for joining us on this Wednesday, May 26, 2021 transmission.
[07:27.520 --> 07:33.840]  I'm extremely thankful to all of you for keeping us on the air because it is my desire to go
[07:33.840 --> 07:44.920]  on fighting the globalist and all of the glory and all of the thanks goes to God for how
[07:44.920 --> 07:50.280]  successful this broadcast has been. But it has been said by the battle ones and it's
[07:50.280 --> 07:58.240]  a true saying that trust in God but tie up your camel. That's like saying trust in God
[07:58.240 --> 08:03.520]  but turn your car off. Trust in God but lock your doors at night. Trust in God but also
[08:03.520 --> 08:07.960]  make sure you tuck your children in at night and make sure they're not on drugs. God helps
[08:07.960 --> 08:13.480]  those who help themselves and then God carries you the rest of the way. And as we see this
[08:13.480 --> 08:19.240]  is a satanic enemy we fight. It's now out of the open. The mask is off. Certainly I have
[08:19.240 --> 08:26.600]  run even closer under the wings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ because this has all
[08:26.600 --> 08:35.240]  just been confirmation of what we're facing. Okay, let me try to put the big overarching
[08:35.240 --> 08:41.240]  spectrum of information on here. And where we are undoubtedly no one needs to hear me
[08:41.240 --> 08:47.640]  say this. You all know this yourself. But just to let it sink in, let it marinate a bit,
[08:47.640 --> 08:52.520]  let us concentrate on it, let us meditate on it, let us go to that quiet place the most
[08:52.520 --> 09:03.160]  high and just take a deep breath and assess where we are. Slow our hearts down, turn our
[09:03.160 --> 09:11.160]  minds up, focus on the evidence, focus on the facts and then let the spirit divine what's
[09:11.160 --> 09:18.760]  happening. There is not just evil in this universe, there is good. And the globalists
[09:18.760 --> 09:22.920]  try to flaunt their power and flaunt their corruption and flaunt the fact that they're
[09:22.920 --> 09:27.800]  above the law to try to break your will and make you give up because they're so disgusting,
[09:27.800 --> 09:33.840]  they're so ugly, they're so spiritually filthy, they smell at a spiritual level like
[09:33.840 --> 09:47.560]  death itself. And they know that they can just run you off from your own destiny into
[09:47.560 --> 09:57.560]  their own system by beating you over the head with their nonsensical corruption, their psychic
[09:57.560 --> 10:05.640]  spiritual virus of decay and failure and betrayal. But once you understand that God's there and
[10:05.640 --> 10:11.000]  good's there and just dwell on that, bring that into your own heart, into your own soul,
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.360]  it begins to protect you and protect others around you so that you can then move forward
[10:16.360 --> 10:24.280]  against the enemy and be victorious. Today's live show headline world exclusive the deep
[10:24.280 --> 10:31.240]  state is fighting for its life as patron insiders leaked the truth on Wuhan COVID-19.
[10:34.520 --> 10:40.600]  What do you think we were doing in January and February of last year when we laid out exactly
[10:40.600 --> 10:47.640]  what's now come out precisely? We were giving you the open source data that patriots in
[10:47.640 --> 10:53.800]  government, in institutions, in private corporations had come out with. You say where are the whistleblowers?
[10:53.800 --> 10:59.960]  People should stand up against this. They did. There was also insiders that gave information
[10:59.960 --> 11:05.240]  to others to put it out publicly and people didn't say, hey, this is super secret because
[11:05.240 --> 11:12.120]  they could be arrested for that. They just said, looks like that's what's happening here. To me,
[11:12.120 --> 11:17.240]  you might want to look at this. So it was all being laid out for you.
[11:20.440 --> 11:24.840]  And how they were going to steal the election. Now they were going to foment civil rest,
[11:24.840 --> 11:30.840]  unrest. Now they were going to come out to the patriots. But right now the entire globalist
[11:30.840 --> 11:36.520]  program is in deep trouble because Fauci and the communist Chinese along with the UN deep state,
[11:37.560 --> 11:47.640]  the globalist, had to all create the new virus so that when scientists looked at it,
[11:47.640 --> 11:52.520]  they would get scared and take it serious. And it is a new form of synthetic virus that
[11:52.520 --> 11:58.040]  they do plan to weaponize and make more deadly in the future. But the fact that they created it,
[11:58.040 --> 12:04.920]  Wuhan, was because it was illegal in the US and China and the globalist group did it as a group
[12:04.920 --> 12:11.720]  project so that none of them could report on the other when it all came out. Unless the entire
[12:11.720 --> 12:19.560]  globalist deep state project between the UN, between the Carnegie and Rockefeller and IBM
[12:19.560 --> 12:24.680]  and Bill and the Gates Foundation information came out. Unless all of them got burned and destroyed,
[12:24.680 --> 12:30.360]  they could release this, use it to bring down the West, use it to permanently lock us down
[12:32.360 --> 12:37.560]  and set themselves up as the saviors with their forced inoculation, global government,
[12:37.560 --> 12:43.320]  cashless society, worldwide medical ID, social credit score, and even implantable microchip
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.920]  agenda which is now out in the open. So they couldn't help themselves. It's their evil mission.
[12:48.920 --> 12:54.040]  It's their plan. They've been preparing for 100 years to do this. They set up communist China
[12:54.040 --> 13:00.200]  as the system to help economically and culturally enforce it and carry it out.
[13:04.200 --> 13:10.280]  Now you see Bloomberg and USA Today and British leaders saying forcibly inoculate
[13:10.280 --> 13:15.160]  vaccine passports when, of course, they told you they would never do that the last year and a half
[13:15.160 --> 13:20.200]  while they prepared it. And so the fact that this is coming out about Fauci,
[13:20.200 --> 13:26.680]  the fact that senators are laying it out and there's State Department reports and it's coming out
[13:26.680 --> 13:30.920]  and confirmed that Biden killed an investigation into the Wuhan lab
[13:33.400 --> 13:39.640]  shows that the system knows that there are enough medical professionals and insiders
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.840]  that have already been turning state's evidence and that have already gone to enough of the
[13:44.840 --> 13:51.160]  mainstream corporate media that they know that the proof of the cover-up has already been confirmed.
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.320]  We have the leaks from inside Facebook and others saying cover-up the truth, cover-up
[13:55.320 --> 14:01.960]  whistleblowers, true criminal collusion. And you have all this information coming out to the point
[14:01.960 --> 14:08.600]  of a large faction of the system has gotten so scared that they're deciding to prepare to burn
[14:08.600 --> 14:14.840]  gates and Fauci and the Chai comms and others because they are so scared of the fact that this
[14:14.840 --> 14:20.600]  is about to come out and it was supposed to only bring in world government, not permanently locked
[14:20.600 --> 14:26.120]  down Europe and the United States, but the Chai comms and other globalist element that run them
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.960]  were ready to go ahead and try to take over now instead of dividing up the world. So again,
[14:31.960 --> 14:38.760]  globalists are infighting like empires always do in the end game and stopping themselves from bringing
[14:38.760 --> 14:43.640]  in their total globalist system and even globalist papers admit that the infighting is going to bring
[14:43.640 --> 14:50.280]  down their system. A lot of people in the system don't want to go ahead with a world government
[14:50.280 --> 14:55.480]  project. Now they know it's about death and destruction and sterilization and war, not the
[14:55.480 --> 14:59.160]  kumbaya world government they were told they were building. A lot of these billionaires,
[14:59.160 --> 15:04.040]  especially the billionaire women, really believe they were creating a one-world system of peace.
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.360]  And so there's that awakening happening about how nightmarish this world government is. This
[15:10.360 --> 15:18.920]  isn't the loving liberal kissy-kissy one, rainbow flag garbage. Then you've got the Chai comms
[15:18.920 --> 15:23.640]  moving forward, breaking their agreements with the globalist and militarily expanding when they
[15:23.640 --> 15:28.840]  were only supposed to economically dominate. And you've got the fact that Biden's still a pure
[15:28.840 --> 15:34.120]  communist Chinese agent and is still going ahead to shut down our pipelines, all basic mining,
[15:34.120 --> 15:41.240]  all rare earth minerals, expanding gas taxes to shut us down. It's so outrageous that the
[15:41.240 --> 15:46.120]  system's bulking at going ahead with the plan because after all, China didn't keep up their
[15:46.120 --> 15:52.280]  end of the deal and the wheels are coming off because the best laid plans of mice and men
[15:52.280 --> 15:56.280]  often go astray. So I'm going to play all the clips, give you all the intel, tell you what's
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.760]  coming next. When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold
[16:00.760 --> 16:04.760]  out for three months, four months, six months, seven months, it's not a gimmick to make you
[16:04.760 --> 16:09.720]  buy the products. I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our
[16:09.720 --> 16:13.880]  great supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation because they're great
[16:13.880 --> 16:17.480]  products that were coming back and getting more and saying it for the sport. But whether it's
[16:17.480 --> 16:22.920]  DNA Force Plus or whether it's pollen block or whether it's Super Bowl Vitality or Vaso Beats,
[16:24.200 --> 16:28.920]  because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower the quality of our products
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.120]  and so we just can't offer them. But thank God it looks like some good things are starting to
[16:34.120 --> 16:37.880]  happen right now because suddenly a lot of products have been sold out for a long time
[16:37.880 --> 16:43.560]  are back in stock and one of them is pollen block. It takes a long time to get into pollen block
[16:43.560 --> 16:48.360]  but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like allergies. It's from France. It's a special
[16:48.360 --> 16:54.120]  proprietary system. This is the highest quality back in stock, infowarstore.com, store-wide free
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.480]  shipping and double patriot points. Check it out. I share with you the viewers and listeners
[17:00.200 --> 17:04.840]  the facts of where info wars is and it's always a complex picture but I do my best to explain it
[17:04.840 --> 17:10.120]  to you because you are the patrons that make all this possible. So in short, the world's
[17:10.120 --> 17:15.480]  awakening, the spiral censorship, info wars has never been more influential and has never had a
[17:15.480 --> 17:21.400]  bigger effect exposing the global's agenda and fighting it. But that said, the COVID lockdowns,
[17:21.400 --> 17:25.720]  the shutdown and supply chains has almost shut us down because most of the best-selling products
[17:25.720 --> 17:30.360]  which you want to buy like DNA Force Plus and others have been sold out for up to seven months.
[17:30.360 --> 17:36.040]  Well, guess what? DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months. It's 40% off,
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.920]  it's amazing, at infowarstore.com and for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have
[17:40.920 --> 17:45.880]  store-wide free shipping and double patriot points and alpha powers back in stock and super
[17:45.880 --> 17:51.080]  mill vitality back in stock and pollen block and vaso beast are all back in stock as much as 50%
[17:51.080 --> 17:56.440]  off store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, infowarstore.com. Thanks for keeping us on the air,
[17:56.440 --> 18:06.440]  infowarriors. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.320]  Welcome back to Alex Jones show. So here's the big announcement, you all know it, you can all see
[18:31.320 --> 18:35.160]  it. And we hope the phones up next day, a lot of the callers are calling in about it. They were
[18:35.160 --> 18:41.720]  saying, wow, why is the system going against Bill Gates suddenly all over the news? Why are they
[18:41.720 --> 18:51.000]  going after Fauci? Well, I mean, they're communist Chinese globalist agents that launched a bioattack
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.680]  on the world and use the media and big tech that they control to lie to us and not let us know
[18:56.680 --> 19:01.960]  about therapeutics and to send sick people to nursing homes to cause mass death and they need
[19:01.960 --> 19:08.600]  to be indicted for Nuremberg too. And the majority of medical doctors and scientists know this
[19:10.200 --> 19:15.720]  and big tech can't suppress this and big tech's own whistleblowers at Facebook, Twitter,
[19:15.720 --> 19:21.320]  YouTube, Google, they're all going public. Huge stories broke yesterday, 20 minute reports veritas
[19:21.320 --> 19:27.960]  saying we're ordered to cover up congressional hearings, legislature hearings, medical doctors,
[19:27.960 --> 19:36.760]  funerals of people that have died, scientific reports, chief medical officers at Pfizer.
[19:37.560 --> 19:41.640]  And imagine me in the Facebook people, they're looking at this and covering this up.
[19:41.640 --> 19:48.920]  Here's the deal. A certain click, a new world order globalist thought they were invincible
[19:48.920 --> 19:52.600]  and they were really pissed about Trump. They were pissed about Bolsonaro and Johnson and others.
[19:54.280 --> 19:59.960]  And so they admit they used the great reset to shut down populism. I mean, that's in the news.
[19:59.960 --> 20:05.240]  John Kerry, Klaus Schwab, they shoot their arrogant mouths off and you ask, why are they so public
[20:05.240 --> 20:09.960]  about we're going to put microchips in you and yeah, we're going to take all your oil-based jobs
[20:09.960 --> 20:14.920]  in America but not in China and not in the Middle East because they have to act confident while
[20:14.920 --> 20:21.960]  they commit these outrageous crimes. This is crazy. Biden signed an order that we can't dig
[20:21.960 --> 20:28.360]  rare earth minerals in America. You know, it's totally safe and good. We can only buy it from
[20:28.360 --> 20:35.080]  China who has 98% rare earth mineral monopoly. How'd they get that? Why can't the Germans or the
[20:35.080 --> 20:41.800]  Indians or the Mexicans or anybody dig up rare earth minerals because China was given an unofficial
[20:41.800 --> 20:49.480]  monopoly 20 years ago. China wasn't even into rare earth minerals 25 years ago. They have 98%
[20:49.480 --> 20:59.480]  control because we're run by a global cabal of banks. America under Obama shut down its last
[20:59.480 --> 21:11.480]  lead smelting plant. What was it? Seven or eight years ago. That's industrial espionage. That's
[21:11.480 --> 21:27.640]  total control and it goes on and on and on. So we're under economic attack. It's that simple
[21:27.640 --> 21:34.680]  and there's powerful forces that don't want to just run up a white flag and bankrupt everything
[21:34.680 --> 21:41.240]  and hand over all their wealth. So very tiny group at the top wants to do this and they're
[21:41.240 --> 21:48.040]  trying to make us walk the plank into a sea of poverty and death. They're all of the news saying,
[21:48.040 --> 21:53.480]  you will eat bugs, you will drink sewage, you will not have children, you will be poor. I've got the
[21:53.480 --> 21:58.600]  clips of Obama saying we can't have cars in air conditioning if we tell Africans they can't,
[21:58.600 --> 22:02.200]  well then tell the Africans they can and just make them cleaner, which they are.
[22:05.960 --> 22:11.720]  So people are waking up to the agenda that we're under assault. This is a war and the minute you
[22:11.720 --> 22:18.440]  wake up to the fact it's a war, it's over for the globalist. So here is Senator Rand Paul
[22:18.440 --> 22:24.120]  and I said this a month ago. I said if they just start confronting Fauci about the lab and how
[22:24.120 --> 22:28.520]  he ran it and how he funded it, it's all hiding in plain view. There is no speculation. They keep
[22:28.520 --> 22:33.640]  saying we need an investigation. That's just one faction of the system threatening the other with
[22:33.640 --> 22:39.720]  the blackmail of this. We already know what happened but the fact that this is out on the table is a
[22:39.720 --> 22:48.680]  huge seismic deal and I said then he perjured himself as a crime and said we've never funded
[22:48.680 --> 22:53.960]  gain of function. We don't. I know nothing about it when he funded himself conferences that gave
[22:53.960 --> 23:01.800]  him credit called gain of function conference and he funded the specific coronavirus and studies
[23:01.800 --> 23:08.920]  on the vaccines nine years ago and he knew it caused blood clots. He knew it caused infertility.
[23:08.920 --> 23:15.640]  The son of a bitch did all this on purpose. That's too kind of term. My God, a man growing up didn't
[23:15.640 --> 23:20.440]  have a daddy at home. That's not a bad thing if you can't help it. This guy is a criminal,
[23:20.440 --> 23:26.840]  a mastermind murderer and we've got him and it's all you got to do is call him on his confidence
[23:26.840 --> 23:33.400]  game and call Gates on it and then it's over. Ladies and gentlemen, you understand in December
[23:33.400 --> 23:38.440]  of 2019, they had an emergency U.N. meeting with the head of the vaccine program in
[23:41.640 --> 23:46.920]  Switzerland and they said the vaccines don't work or poison us. All the doctors are turning
[23:46.920 --> 23:51.480]  against us. We've got a wobbly front line. This was all a response to an even bigger
[23:51.480 --> 23:56.600]  crisis and disaster, a bigger fire, a bigger dumpster fire to cover up the last one.
[23:58.920 --> 24:02.760]  So I understand how they operate. We've got their number. We've got the sources. We've got
[24:02.760 --> 24:08.520]  the research. We've got the technology. We've exposed them. They're politically destroyed
[24:08.520 --> 24:11.800]  if we just keep pushing. Now, you know, though, what they're going to do.
[24:12.760 --> 24:16.440]  They're going to pull some even bigger crisis to cover this up. That's what I've been saying
[24:16.440 --> 24:20.760]  for 16 months. We'll talk about that next segment because we're tomorrow's news today.
[24:20.760 --> 24:25.000]  We don't need to dwell on what we already told you that now came true. But I'm going to tell you how
[24:26.120 --> 24:29.800]  Fauci and Gates can go down and I'm going to recommend this to those in the establishment
[24:29.800 --> 24:34.920]  that are smart. So I will advise not just the public, but those that aren't complete psychotics
[24:34.920 --> 24:41.400]  in the global system when we come back. But first, here's Senator Rand Paul on the final
[24:41.400 --> 24:46.520]  torpedo that'll sink the Chai-Com arm of the new old order. Here it is. Senator, you introduced an
[24:46.520 --> 24:51.960]  amendment that would ban the funding of gain of function research in China. You've also had that
[24:51.960 --> 24:57.880]  vibrant exchange with Dr. Fauci about this a couple of weeks ago where he told you that NIH
[24:57.880 --> 25:03.560]  has never, does not now, fund gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.960]  Excuse me. So did Dr. Fauci, do you believe he perjured himself in front of Congress on this
[25:07.960 --> 25:14.200]  issue? If so, why? Absolutely. He lied to the American people. There was a gain of function
[25:14.200 --> 25:20.920]  research going on with this Dr. Xi Zengali at the Wuhan Institute. In her paper, she actually
[25:20.920 --> 25:30.040]  thanks Dr. Fauci and the NIAID, which is a part of NIH that Dr. Fauci runs. It's listed at the
[25:30.040 --> 25:39.000]  end of the paper. This paper was funded by NIAID research, and it lists a 10-digit number that
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.360]  identifies the research money that she got from the United States. Was it gain of function?
[25:44.360 --> 25:51.000]  Well, it took a SARS virus, which is a coronavirus that's 15 times more deadly than COVID,
[25:51.560 --> 25:59.080]  and it added to it S-protein, which is something on the surface of it, to make it more easily
[25:59.080 --> 26:05.960]  infectious to human epithelial cells for the respiratory tract. That to me is gain of function.
[26:05.960 --> 26:11.160]  We have at least one scientist from Rutgers and another scientist from MIT who've looked at this
[26:11.160 --> 26:17.800]  paper and say it is gain of function, and she says she did it with an NIH fund. Dr. Fauci says no.
[26:18.520 --> 26:22.840]  I think he needs to be quizzed, but he goes on these shows and they all yuck it up and laugh,
[26:22.840 --> 26:28.200]  and laugh about how everybody's a conspiracy theory, but nobody asks him any tough questions,
[26:28.200 --> 26:33.240]  because the left is so enthralled with all his dictates, and he's become sort of this
[26:34.040 --> 26:38.680]  glorious purveyor of truth for the left that nobody asks him any tough questions.
[26:38.680 --> 26:45.000]  So, there you go. No doubt that he perjured himself. He's a lying sack of garbage, and it's
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.760]  like, wow, he's the guy that cooked it up, did it, launched it. Trump's biggest enemy.
[26:48.760 --> 26:52.680]  He bragged in 2017 that we're going to have an epidemic that challenges Trump.
[26:52.680 --> 26:55.960]  He guaranteed it. He was bragging. He needs to be hauled into prison.
[26:57.400 --> 27:04.040]  I'm giving you a status report on what your support of info wars has done. We are kicking
[27:04.040 --> 27:09.720]  globalists ass up and down the planet right now. Their entire agenda of depopulation,
[27:09.720 --> 27:14.520]  poison vaccines, it's all coming out. And yes, I'm risking my life, and yes, this is very dangerous,
[27:14.520 --> 27:18.600]  but it's worth it. I'm very honored to be in the fight, so thanks for keeping me in the fight,
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.880]  and our great crew here at info wars. And here's the other good news. This has been sold out

[28:05.960 --> 28:10.120]  telling you about how the globals are getting exposed and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.440]  weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in. I can even tell you about how the states
[28:14.440 --> 28:18.760]  are turning against the public president Biden and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try
[28:18.760 --> 28:23.640]  to make people wear masks. I could tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you
[28:23.640 --> 28:28.840]  about the super good news concerning the info war? That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running

[30:13.000 --> 30:23.000]  Don't know much about history. Don't know much biology. Don't know much about a science book.
[30:24.280 --> 30:33.240]  Don't know much about the French I've took. But I do know that I love you. And I know that if you
[30:33.240 --> 30:43.480]  love me too, world around the world, this would be. Don't know much about geography. Don't know
[30:43.480 --> 30:50.280]  much trigonometry. What is this song about a Democrat? They're always talking about how smart
[30:50.280 --> 30:55.000]  they are, how they know everything, how they know the science. Really, as the average Democrat read,
[30:55.000 --> 31:03.640]  scanned over 300 studies on COVID-19 vaccines. The ones they all tried to get developed before,
[31:03.640 --> 31:10.280]  COVID-19 is a literature from 2015, how it was banned at Chapel Hill, North Carolina with
[31:10.280 --> 31:17.640]  Obama and Fauci producing bio weapons level gain of function. No, they don't. They just think
[31:17.640 --> 31:22.360]  they're getting political power out of the virus when they're destroying their own future and
[31:22.360 --> 31:29.240]  deindustrializing their own nation. So I want to go through the incredible stack of COVID-19 news
[31:29.240 --> 31:35.480]  because undermining the lives of COVID-19, undermining Fauci and dates, is the central
[31:35.480 --> 31:45.080]  pillar to the entire EU, CHICOM, Hollywood, leftist, blue city, criminal cartel. The global
[31:45.080 --> 31:49.320]  has developed a psychological warfare algorithm. They even admit that on how to keep you locked down,
[31:49.320 --> 31:54.280]  how to make you take poison vaccines, how to make you wear masks, how to make you accept a tracker
[31:54.280 --> 32:01.400]  system, which is the world ID, how they use conformity, how they pay off millions of influencers
[32:01.400 --> 32:07.400]  online and usually just a few thousand dollars a piece. They go out and say how great the vaccine
[32:07.400 --> 32:14.520]  is when it's not even a vaccine. We expose them, we push back, they fall because they're going for
[32:14.520 --> 32:22.760]  everything. They're going for broke. I've got today and yesterday stacks of prominent people dying
[32:22.760 --> 32:32.680]  after they take the vaccine, movie stars, talk show hosts, models, famous sports figures.
[32:34.920 --> 32:41.240]  It just goes on and on. You know the first man in the world to take the COVID-19 Pfizer shots
[32:41.240 --> 32:47.720]  dead or to doornail, right? One of the top models in the UK and also in Europe, she's dead.
[32:48.920 --> 32:54.600]  She said the vaccine's killing me and she died a week after she took it.
[32:56.120 --> 33:01.240]  And I had one of the top grapplers in the world in here, Craig Jones yesterday.
[33:02.520 --> 33:07.560]  He took one shot and got deadly ill and I said, oh, let me guess, you already had COVID-19. He goes,
[33:07.560 --> 33:14.920]  yeah, exactly. Take the first shot and get really sick because you already had COVID.
[33:14.920 --> 33:21.880]  Oh, and a top John Hopkins virologist has come out and said, this is all a lie. Half the public has
[33:21.880 --> 33:27.400]  immunity already and it's deadly dangerous to give somebody a COVID vaccine if you've had the
[33:27.400 --> 33:34.600]  vaccine and he's gone public. Just like the Nobel Prize winner, top French virologist,
[33:34.600 --> 33:42.680]  the discoverer of HIV said, if you already have had COVID and you take this, it can kill you.
[33:44.360 --> 33:49.720]  He said, you're done for. There's no hope for you. I mean, this is, that's the thing, folks.
[33:50.280 --> 33:54.040]  It'd be one thing if it killed 1% of people. That would be the scandal of all scandals.
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.240]  This damn shot is super deadly. And that's why I've been freaking out for a year and a half going.
[33:59.880 --> 34:03.800]  Okay. So all the studies, they already secretly tested this on animals. They're just claiming
[34:03.800 --> 34:06.840]  they're going to skip animal trials because they know it's going to kill most of the animals.
[34:06.840 --> 34:11.720]  In some cases, all of them. In the case of ferrets, all of them. Just a virus vector shot.
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.560]  It's even worse with these Moderna delivery systems in Pfizer. And so how are they going
[34:17.560 --> 34:23.080]  to get away with this? How do you do something this big? Well, how they get away with the autism
[34:23.080 --> 34:27.800]  and the tainted vaccines and that whole program in the last 30 years with hundreds of millions of
[34:27.800 --> 34:34.120]  boys, brain damage worldwide, because boys have wheat, blood, brain, berries, compared to girls,
[34:34.120 --> 34:44.280]  but eight to one, nine to one boys. And it's obvious with a gigantic, gigantic, huge distraction.
[34:44.280 --> 34:47.240]  Well, the war is not enough because you'll still know the vaccine's killing people.
[34:47.240 --> 34:50.360]  A stock market crash isn't enough because people still know the vaccine's killing people.
[34:50.920 --> 34:57.160]  It's got to be a new bio release that you say is causing all the death
[34:57.160 --> 35:01.160]  that hits within six months to a year. Most of the medical scientists and experts agree,
[35:01.160 --> 35:06.920]  six months to a year, two to three years for others. Because again, in most of the animal
[35:06.920 --> 35:12.920]  studies, they started killing the mice and rats in a couple months. Other animals they tested on
[35:14.920 --> 35:20.920]  six months a year. Well, humans are stronger and you'll have longer lifespans. And so they've done
[35:20.920 --> 35:25.080]  a lot of studies and they know generally, well, if it's killing rats in a week, probably kill humans
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.360]  in a couple months. And it's all guesstimation, but that's why they do these studies and test.
[35:30.360 --> 35:36.200]  And what we're closest to is pigs and mice, not genetically, just drugs and things that kill mice
[35:36.200 --> 35:41.960]  and kill pigs kill us. Not even as much with chimpanzees. I mean, you'd think that that's not
[35:41.960 --> 35:47.080]  right. It's pigs and mice. That's an admitted fact. And pigs and mice, this stuff's killing them, folks.
[35:47.960 --> 35:54.040]  Killing them quick. So we're dead. I mean, there are going to be a lot of dead people all over the
[35:54.040 --> 36:00.280]  place. So how the hell are they going to get away with that? I started saying this in February
[36:00.280 --> 36:05.960]  last year. And I said, gates will come out in an ounce that a new, more deadly virus is about to
[36:05.960 --> 36:13.080]  be released by terrorists that will be similar to COVID-19. And he went on a bunch of shows two
[36:13.080 --> 36:19.880]  months later, Colbert and Faridzarkaria and said exactly that. And people all got chills. They said,
[36:19.880 --> 36:24.680]  how the hell did you know that, Jones? I mean, folks, when you study these monsters, you figure it out.
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.040]  They covered up the giant vaccine damage with a new giant vaccine with even more damage.
[36:32.920 --> 36:39.160]  And so the obvious thing is to, again, use the damage from that vaccine and say it's something
[36:39.160 --> 36:44.920]  else in the future. That's a no-brainer. That's mere deduction, my dear Watson.
[36:44.920 --> 36:53.160]  They got other curb balls too. And we'll talk about those in the next segment. But let me just
[36:53.160 --> 36:58.520]  stop here before I play more of these clips. We are very extremely excited in so many ways
[36:59.560 --> 37:05.080]  to have our flagship product, DNA Force Plus back in stock. It's got so many proprietary
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.360]  high-end ingredients that for almost seven months it wasn't in.
[37:08.360 --> 37:14.120]  Highest quality PQQ, CoQ tip, and the list just goes on from there. Cleans out your cells,
[37:14.120 --> 37:20.760]  makes your telomeres not grow, but shrink slower. Every time your cells replicate,
[37:20.760 --> 37:24.760]  it breaks off more of the telomere, like a candle burning down. It burns down to zero.
[37:24.760 --> 37:28.600]  You know what happens? You look like the walking dead. Most of your cells are basically dead.
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.960]  Your cells can't divide anymore, and you fail. You die. The average person at 74,
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.800]  the most long lived about 120. And the people that they've learned that
[37:40.920 --> 37:46.200]  lived 120 have the PQQ, the CoQ tip, that is just in tiny amounts of nature.
[37:47.000 --> 37:54.440]  Well, it's in this. It's super high quality. It's 40% off, infowarstore.com. It does so much.

[37:58.920 --> 38:03.400]  research. This is amazing. The Japanese are the ones that basically discovered all this
[38:03.400 --> 38:08.040]  the last 20 years. They're obsessed with it in Japan, and we basically have a Japanese-style
[38:08.040 --> 38:14.040]  formula that is sold in medical labs around the world for twice or three times the price.
[38:14.040 --> 38:18.520]  We sell it for the ingredients, and it's extremely costly for us when you see the price tag on it.
[38:18.520 --> 38:24.760]  Know that that is very, very low for what you are getting. Also, back in stock,
[38:25.480 --> 38:30.920]  pollen block, a very special natural proprietary system for seasonal discomfort allergies.
[38:30.920 --> 38:36.840]  And it deals with quail egg shells that are specially fed, a special diet in France. It's
[38:36.840 --> 38:41.320]  a secret. It's a food product. They're allowed to keep it secret. It's not like the mRNA vaccine.
[38:41.320 --> 38:45.160]  It's some GMO secret. It's just a secret. It's proprietary. And it works really,
[38:45.160 --> 38:48.280]  really good for a lot of people. So check it out. A lot of five-star reviews.

[39:09.560 --> 39:13.880]  prostagard. It's basically a multivitamin with the saw palmetto that's so good for your glands,
[39:13.880 --> 39:17.480]  not just men. It's great for women as well, but it's documented for the prostate. Even medical
[39:17.480 --> 39:23.240]  doctors prescribe it. Alpha power is the dry form of supermelt vitality. It's a lot stronger,
[39:23.240 --> 39:29.000]  technically, but not cold pressed. So different strokes for different folks. If you like supermelt
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.760]  vitality, you'll have alpha power, ultra 12, high-quality vitamin B, 12 taking out of the tongue,

[39:51.160 --> 39:55.080]  Store-wide free shipping on top of that and double pay-free appointments. I almost forgot. Stay with
[39:55.080 --> 40:01.000]  us. I'm not going to say this five times on the road of the obnoxious. I'm saying it because it's
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.680]  the key to victory over these criminals. Last week, the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half
[40:08.680 --> 40:14.920]  of the CDC's top morass and workers, medical doctors, scientists, nurses, you name it, have
[40:14.920 --> 40:21.880]  taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot. I'm going to say the second time. Around half of the doctors
[40:21.880 --> 40:30.360]  at the CDC and NIH refused to take the franken shots. They don't trust it. You shouldn't trust it.
[40:30.360 --> 40:34.280]  The vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world. This is an attack
[40:34.280 --> 40:40.120]  on the American people and the people of the world. This is an absolute red flag-smoking guy.
[40:40.120 --> 40:46.120]  Again, let me say it two more times. Around half of the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC,
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.920]  the medical staff refused to take the vaccines. That's right. The doctors, nurses, scientists do
[40:50.920 --> 40:55.640]  not trust a so-called vaccine. You shouldn't either. You should warn everyone you know about the truth.
[40:58.120 --> 41:02.680]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[41:02.680 --> 41:06.680]  2-8-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[41:32.680 --> 41:54.680]  2-8-5-3-3-3-1-3-9.
[41:54.680 --> 42:04.280]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials. Right now, we've got store-wide free shipping.
[42:04.840 --> 42:11.160]  We've got double-patria points. We've got 40% off on DNA Force Plus, sold out for seven months.
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.320]  We've got 50% off on Ultra-12, 50% off on Vaso Beads, 50% off on Alpha Power. These are all
[42:17.320 --> 42:21.320]  incredible products. I talk about each one for several minutes. A lot of you have already used
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.640]  them. Some of you haven't. You've got to go check these out. These are all top-of-the-line formulas.
[42:25.640 --> 42:30.040]  Some of them clones of best-sellers. Others, original formulations that we came up with,
[42:30.040 --> 42:34.280]  with top developers to blow people away. And it's all there. There's a bunch of other big
[42:34.280 --> 42:41.000]  specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales and specials to mention them all here
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.120]  today. But whatever you do, go to m4shore.com with a store-wide free shipping and double-patria
[42:46.120 --> 42:51.880]  points and sold out for seven months. DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 that's been sold
[42:51.880 --> 42:59.560]  out is now back in stock 40% off m4shore.com. When I get up here and tell you that most of our best
[42:59.560 --> 43:03.560]  selling products have been sold out for three months, four months, six months, seven months,
[43:03.560 --> 43:08.840]  it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products. I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners
[43:08.840 --> 43:13.160]  were buying enough of our great supplements and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation
[43:13.160 --> 43:16.760]  because they're great products. We're coming back and getting more and thank you for the support.
[43:16.760 --> 43:22.600]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's pollen block or whether it's supermobility or vaso
[43:22.600 --> 43:28.280]  beats, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower the quality of
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.640]  our products and so we just can't offer them. But thank God it looks like some good things are
[43:33.640 --> 43:37.880]  starting to happen right now because suddenly a lot of products have been sold out for a long time
[43:37.880 --> 43:43.560]  are back in stock and one of them is pollen block. It takes a long time to get into pollen block
[43:43.560 --> 43:48.360]  but it's for seasonal discomfort stuff like allergies. It's from France. It's a special
[43:48.360 --> 43:54.680]  proprietary system. This is the highest quality back in stock m4shore.com. Store-wide free shipping
[43:54.680 --> 43:56.280]  and double patriot points. Check it out.
[43:56.280 --> 44:06.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:27.240 --> 44:38.680]  All right.
[44:38.680 --> 44:56.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, history is unfolding before us right now.
[44:56.580 --> 45:04.440]  And bowing down to these tyrants, showing fear only encourages them, instead draw the
[45:04.440 --> 45:12.200]  white-hot sword of truth, and take them on, and never back down, because we will fight
[45:12.200 --> 45:17.200]  them politically and spiritually and culturally and physically if they attack us first, under
[45:17.200 --> 45:18.200]  blood-red skies.
[45:18.200 --> 45:24.120]  All right, let me just run through these headlines and I'll hit the real meat of what
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.800]  I believe is about to happen next.
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.840]  Rand Paul, Fauci, absolutely committed perjury over Wuhan funding denial.
[45:31.840 --> 45:35.320]  Get that article, spread it from infowars.com.
[45:35.320 --> 45:36.320]  Report.
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.720]  Biden admin shut down investigation into Wuhan lab leak.
[45:39.720 --> 45:42.600]  The administration is even admitting they did.
[45:42.600 --> 45:44.520]  Oh, Chinese agent.
[45:44.520 --> 45:47.640]  They're seeing in his article about Pompeo leading the effort.
[45:47.640 --> 45:49.680]  We already knew all this.
[45:49.680 --> 45:51.760]  Chinese state media is turning on Fauci.
[45:51.760 --> 45:53.840]  I'm at Wuhan lab controversy.
[45:53.840 --> 45:56.440]  Oh, getting ready to throw him under the bus.
[45:56.440 --> 45:59.360]  They realize what's happening.
[45:59.360 --> 46:06.800]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship, then the ship sinks.
[46:06.800 --> 46:12.640]  Model dies days after receiving AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, the one that's causing the
[46:12.640 --> 46:14.680]  blood clots in the brain, the stroke.
[46:14.680 --> 46:17.360]  She died of a violent stroke.
[46:17.360 --> 46:19.200]  She was in excellent health.
[46:19.200 --> 46:23.880]  She's as dead as a doornail.
[46:23.880 --> 46:29.520]  First man in the world to get approved COVID jab is dead, Britt William Shakespeare has
[46:29.520 --> 46:33.120]  died.
[46:33.120 --> 46:34.840]  And it goes on and on.
[46:34.840 --> 46:36.040]  Here's what I mentioned earlier.
[46:36.040 --> 46:38.600]  John Hopkins professor.
[46:38.600 --> 46:40.600]  Half of Americans have natural immunity.
[46:40.600 --> 46:44.760]  Dismissing it is biggest failure of medical leadership because it's like, it'd be like
[46:44.760 --> 46:51.400]  a math class teacher teaching first graders that two plus two equals nine.
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.000]  And other math teachers are like, no, it equals four, and they go, no, does it?
[46:55.000 --> 46:58.960]  You're like, no, but I mean, general public has immunity.
[46:58.960 --> 47:00.920]  Most people are ace at command when they get sick.
[47:00.920 --> 47:03.000]  No, everyone needs a shot.
[47:03.000 --> 47:05.760]  Well, especially if you've already had it, it can kill you to take you have an auto
[47:05.760 --> 47:06.760]  immune response.
[47:06.760 --> 47:07.760]  That's basic science.
[47:07.760 --> 47:08.760]  No, it's not.
[47:08.760 --> 47:09.760]  No, it's not.
[47:09.760 --> 47:10.760]  You're a Nazi.
[47:10.760 --> 47:11.760]  You're a Nazi.
[47:11.760 --> 47:12.760]  Nazi.
[47:12.760 --> 47:13.760]  Nazi.
[47:13.760 --> 47:14.760]  Nazi.
[47:14.760 --> 47:15.760]  Nazi.
[47:15.760 --> 47:16.760]  Nazi.
[47:16.760 --> 47:17.760]  I'm a liberal.
[47:17.760 --> 47:18.760]  I love Bill Gates.
[47:18.760 --> 47:19.760]  I'm anti-establishment.
[47:19.760 --> 47:20.760]  I love Bill Gates.
[47:20.760 --> 47:21.760]  I'm a Nazi populist.
[47:21.760 --> 47:22.760]  I'm liberal.
[47:22.760 --> 47:23.760]  I'm liberal.
[47:23.760 --> 47:24.760]  Look, I'm proud of myself.
[47:24.760 --> 47:25.760]  I'm good.
[47:25.760 --> 47:27.640]  I want to be part of the system.
[47:27.640 --> 47:32.560]  And then look at these trolls that take it.
[47:32.560 --> 47:37.000]  These idiots, they don't have any sense.
[47:37.000 --> 47:43.520]  And again, when you fall for a scam, you fall for bigger and bigger scams.
[47:43.520 --> 47:46.400]  These are photos they themselves are putting out.
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.920]  They think it's really bad ass that, you know, oh, you're dirty.
[47:50.920 --> 47:51.920]  We don't wear a mask.
[47:51.920 --> 47:53.480]  And now I still wear my mask.
[47:53.480 --> 47:54.480]  I've got my shot.
[47:54.480 --> 47:58.760]  And they're so weak minded when they die of cancer in five years or a heart attack
[47:58.760 --> 47:59.760]  in six months.
[47:59.760 --> 48:03.920]  No one will say, they'll be on their deathbed going, I don't blame my vaccine.
[48:03.920 --> 48:06.640]  I take again all these videos.
[48:06.640 --> 48:10.960]  I'm paralyzed now and I eat through a tube, but they say it was a vaccine, but I'm willing
[48:10.960 --> 48:12.560]  to do it for the greater good.
[48:12.560 --> 48:14.120]  There is no greater good.
[48:14.120 --> 48:15.120]  It's not a vaccine.
[48:15.120 --> 48:17.720]  It's a gene therapy weapon.
[48:17.720 --> 48:21.280]  Oh, I don't listen to Alex Jones.
[48:21.280 --> 48:23.040]  He talks too fast.
[48:23.040 --> 48:24.040]  He's dumb.
[48:24.040 --> 48:25.640]  I'm smart.
[48:25.640 --> 48:28.200]  I have green hair.
[48:28.200 --> 48:31.600]  Great.
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.640]  I have gray hair.
[48:36.640 --> 48:37.640]  So it continues.
[48:37.640 --> 48:40.520]  John Hopper's professor, half Americans have natural immunity.
[48:40.520 --> 48:46.280]  Just missing it is biggest failure of medical leadership, oh, but schools are on alert for
[48:46.280 --> 48:52.480]  new variants, oh, which people taking vaccines create.
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.440]  Wall Street Journal promotes article demanding vaccine passports to make airlines happy.
[48:56.440 --> 48:58.000]  Oh, that'll make them happy.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.680]  Let's make them happy.
[48:59.680 --> 49:04.040]  Frank Luntz held focus group that said Trump voters will accept vaccine passports to go
[49:04.040 --> 49:05.400]  on vacation.
[49:05.400 --> 49:08.200]  Frank Luntz just tells you that you'll accept it.
[49:08.200 --> 49:09.200]  Total con man.
[49:09.200 --> 49:15.520]  No blowers exposed Facebook's secret algorithm to suppress negative vaccine experiments
[49:15.520 --> 49:16.520]  and experiences.
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.760]  They say even true ones, especially credible ones from doctors can't let the public hear
[49:21.760 --> 49:26.400]  from doctors, much less the public as consumers even talk about what happened to them, much
[49:26.400 --> 49:28.400]  less as humans.
[49:28.400 --> 49:34.320]  And then they're covering up on the death certificate, how people are really dying because
[49:34.320 --> 49:39.680]  of G, the CDC's the company's private system basically with government power that is heavily
[49:39.680 --> 49:45.480]  invested in the vaccines, the CDC funds off of vaccines.
[49:45.480 --> 49:51.640]  The definition of a conflict of interest, but before we drill back down into more of
[49:51.640 --> 49:54.840]  this, let me just quantify it very simply.
[49:54.840 --> 49:58.200]  There is a major deep state battle going on.
[49:58.200 --> 50:02.360]  The deep state is not monolithic, global government is not monolithic.
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.160]  They're trying to make it monolithic with the world ID on the Chinese communist basis
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.760]  and it will be with the carbon tax and the vaccine passport system.
[50:10.760 --> 50:18.240]  They're now announcing that they want world ration card apps to lower the carbon footprint
[50:18.240 --> 50:23.360]  and they go, oh, that'll just be piggy bank or piggyback and piggy banking off of the
[50:23.360 --> 50:27.680]  vaccine passport because that's all it is is a global tracking taxing system that'll
[50:27.680 --> 50:32.840]  now track all your calories off the damn smartphone.
[50:32.840 --> 50:38.320]  That's the admitted plan decades ago and now it's all here and these idiots are like, no
[50:38.320 --> 50:40.800]  one's going to make you have a vaccine passport.
[50:40.800 --> 50:42.880]  Now they're like, you better take one.
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.520]  We told you that was happening while they built the system, they said it wasn't coming
[50:47.520 --> 50:51.400]  so we couldn't build opposition.
[50:51.400 --> 50:55.920]  And so all of humanity has to make a decision.
[50:55.920 --> 50:59.880]  Do you want to live under this program of total enslavement and pretend you're part
[50:59.880 --> 51:04.040]  of it and pretend you're submitting so you're part of the smart science group or are you
[51:04.040 --> 51:05.040]  going to wake up?
[51:05.040 --> 51:11.000]  This is a exterminist, totally ruthless nightmare system that runs death camps in China and Africa
[51:11.000 --> 51:16.680]  and will totally exploit you as well if you don't stand up for our rights together collectively
[51:16.680 --> 51:22.280]  and demand a real social contract based on a pro human future and an environment that's
[51:22.280 --> 51:29.080]  sustainable and a goal to build a universe of justice and love and creativity and human
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.240]  empowerment because I'll assure you Bill Gates and Clark Schwab are not the curators
[51:33.240 --> 51:34.240]  of that.
[51:34.240 --> 51:42.760]  Tim Cook, who again pressures the Chinese to pay the slaves less than build his components,
[51:42.760 --> 51:46.520]  is not the curator of some wonderful Valhalla.
[51:46.520 --> 51:52.160]  He's the curator of hell, but he has a nice little snake voice to put you to sleep.
[51:52.160 --> 51:58.000]  While he does it, Apple's the company with suicide nets.
[51:58.000 --> 52:06.120]  And if you complain about 18 hour work days, you're sent to a death camp so you better
[52:06.120 --> 52:10.920]  smile all the robots you're helping build are getting ready to replace you.
[52:10.920 --> 52:13.280]  So that's what's happening and that's why you see this.
[52:13.280 --> 52:18.360]  Prosecutor and Trump criminal probe convenes grand jury to hear evidence and weigh potential
[52:18.360 --> 52:25.080]  charges, Leticia James literally put in by Soros who said elect me and I will put Trump
[52:25.080 --> 52:30.280]  in jail, show me the man, I'll give you the crime.
[52:30.280 --> 52:34.880]  Same woman sings, you want to put me in jail and they are now moving forward to try to
[52:34.880 --> 52:38.440]  put President Trump in jail for nothing.
[52:38.440 --> 52:44.160]  Well, Hunter Biden, the laptop and Biden in the Chinese and all the sellouts and all
[52:44.160 --> 52:49.880]  the pedophilia, all of that protected, all of that out in the open, but it's okay because
[52:49.880 --> 52:50.880]  she's black.
[52:50.880 --> 52:52.960]  It's like, well, she's a black woman.
[52:52.960 --> 52:58.880]  And so it's okay if she sets Trump up and tries to put him in jail.
[52:58.880 --> 53:03.640]  And Trump's been told, if he doesn't roll over and hand the Republican party over to
[53:03.640 --> 53:08.920]  the globalist, they're going to indict Giuliani and then his son and then him.
[53:08.920 --> 53:11.520]  And then if they can get Trump, they can get everybody.
[53:11.520 --> 53:14.640]  Like I told Trump, they can censor me, they can censor you buddy.
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.360]  Trump can't even get a video player on his own website.
[53:18.360 --> 53:21.480]  All his people are double agents surrounding or idiots.
[53:21.480 --> 53:24.040]  There's your 4D chess.
[53:24.040 --> 53:27.280]  Trump is trying to do a decent, pragmatic job and turn our economy back on and not screw
[53:27.280 --> 53:28.280]  us.
[53:28.280 --> 53:30.360]  He was just trying to be a businessman, but he wasn't God.
[53:30.360 --> 53:34.960]  It just seemed like heaven compared to the Democrats and the New World Order.
[53:34.960 --> 53:37.080]  But he's surrounded by filth.
[53:37.080 --> 53:41.440]  It's like trying to build a house with no nails, no two by fours, no cement.
[53:41.440 --> 53:43.440]  He is, has nothing.
[53:43.440 --> 53:44.760]  He's in a wasteland.
[53:44.760 --> 53:50.080]  He can't even, he's got a message board that only he can post to.
[53:50.080 --> 53:55.160]  No videos, no production, nothing, because if you left a finger to help him, everyone
[53:55.160 --> 53:59.120]  around him is under surveillance, everyone's being followed, everyone's being threatened
[53:59.120 --> 54:01.520]  down to the janitors that work around him.
[54:01.520 --> 54:06.720]  And an average person rolls over and pisses on themselves like a dog that's scared and
[54:06.720 --> 54:07.720]  does nothing.
[54:07.720 --> 54:10.000]  So the answer is stand up.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  Be strong.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.960]  Get in the face of the bullies, because if they're able to bully everybody else like
[54:13.960 --> 54:17.280]  they've done around Trump, they're going to win the whole shooting match.
[54:17.280 --> 54:21.600]  And people are figuring that out that, wait, if I grovel and give in, things get 10 times
[54:21.600 --> 54:22.600]  worse.
[54:22.600 --> 54:23.600]  I better stop giving in.
[54:23.600 --> 54:24.600]  I better stop being pushed around.
[54:24.600 --> 54:26.400]  I better stop living in fear.
[54:26.400 --> 54:29.320]  As for us, we are intensifying our boldness.
[54:29.320 --> 54:31.520]  We are going into the maelstrom.
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.000]  We accept whatever happens and I commit my soul, my body, my children, everything I am
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  to God.
[54:37.000 --> 54:38.000]  I am in God's hands.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  I trust in God.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.880]  Whatever God's plan is, is if I am destroyed, that is God's will, but I will take the new
[54:43.880 --> 54:45.360]  order with me.
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.880]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where info wars is.
[54:50.880 --> 54:54.640]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you
[54:54.640 --> 54:57.560]  are the patrons that make all this possible.
[54:57.560 --> 55:02.840]  So in short, the world's awakening to spiral the censorship info wars has never been more
[55:02.840 --> 55:07.800]  influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[55:07.800 --> 55:13.360]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because
[55:13.360 --> 55:17.360]  most of the best selling products which you want to buy, like DNA Force Plus and others,
[55:17.360 --> 55:19.320]  have been sold out for up to seven months.
[55:19.320 --> 55:20.320]  Well guess what?
[55:20.320 --> 55:23.920]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God, for seven months.
[55:23.920 --> 55:24.920]  It's 40% off.
[55:24.920 --> 55:25.920]  It's amazing.
[55:25.920 --> 55:26.920]  At infowarshore.com.
[55:26.920 --> 55:31.560]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide free shipping and double
[55:31.560 --> 55:36.400]  patriot points and alpha powers back in stock and supermobile vitalities back in stock and
[55:36.400 --> 55:41.520]  pollen block and vaso-beaster all back in stock as much as 50% off store-wide free shipping,
[55:41.520 --> 55:43.520]  double patriot points, infowarshore.com.
[55:43.520 --> 55:47.400]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, info warriors.
[55:47.400 --> 55:51.560]  You know, I'm cutting an ad right now and I've been here on the Saturday cutting days.
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.920]  I've done a terrible job because I just cut like five ads and I didn't tell people the
[55:56.920 --> 55:58.480]  most important part.
[55:58.480 --> 56:04.320]  No, it's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months and is back in stock
[56:04.320 --> 56:05.320]  and it's 40% off.
[56:05.320 --> 56:09.480]  Or how the supply chain broke down and how it almost bankrupted us, but thank God, it
[56:09.480 --> 56:10.480]  finally came in.
[56:10.480 --> 56:14.800]  Or how it cleans up your mitochondria and makes your telomeres last longer and can
[56:14.800 --> 56:15.800]  regrow nerves.
[56:15.800 --> 56:17.800]  You've got to go research DNA Force Plus.
[56:17.800 --> 56:18.800]  No, it's not that.
[56:18.800 --> 56:23.000]  The reason I just cut all those ads and forgot the most important point, the supermobile
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.760]  vitalities back in stock, 50% off, the processing arts back 40% off, the alpha powers back 50%
[56:28.760 --> 56:34.440]  off, that ultra-12, vitamin B12, take another tongue, it's incredible, is back also 50%
[56:34.440 --> 56:40.000]  off, or vasobes, back 50% off, no, it's that we've got double-patriot points and free
[56:40.000 --> 56:48.120]  shipping store wide, double-patriot points, free shipping store wide on top of these huge
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.560]  sales.
[56:50.560 --> 57:06.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:06.360 --> 57:30.840]  When you are overthrowing a government, the local police are obviously going to be a problem.
[57:30.840 --> 57:36.320]  After the Bolshevik Revolution, a secret police force was created to purge the public
[57:36.320 --> 57:39.460]  of any political opposition.
[57:39.460 --> 57:44.880]  After Hitler came to power, the notification of local police departments took only three
[57:44.880 --> 57:52.080]  years, leaving a fully centralized police force under the control of SS leader Heinrich
[57:52.080 --> 57:55.720]  Himmler by 1936.
[57:55.720 --> 58:03.320]  In Venezuela, Maduro created a paramilitary force and employs non-state actors to fight
[58:03.320 --> 58:06.160]  against citizen patriots.
[58:06.160 --> 58:11.420]  It's an obvious priority when you plan on overthrowing a country and eliminating people's
[58:11.420 --> 58:16.560]  constitutional rights, then you have to deal with the police who have sworn an oath to
[58:16.560 --> 58:18.960]  protect those rights.
[58:18.960 --> 58:21.760]  And we are now witnessing this in America.
[58:21.760 --> 58:26.960]  In Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler came to power as one of the biggest landowners of
[58:26.960 --> 58:32.840]  Austin and spends most of his time perched above the city in the tallest penthouse,
[58:32.840 --> 58:34.400]  which is fitting.
[58:34.400 --> 58:40.720]  Adler does not act according to the will of the people, but rather as their king.
[58:40.720 --> 58:45.900]  When asked by Weiss if he regretted ending the camping ban, which has unquestionably
[58:45.900 --> 58:51.120]  brought thousands of dangerous transients from all over the country into the once safe
[58:51.120 --> 58:57.400]  streets of Austin, he proudly admits to forcing his own disruptive agenda upon the people
[58:57.400 --> 58:58.400]  of Austin.
[58:58.400 --> 59:00.160]  Was it a mistake to lift the ban?
[59:00.160 --> 59:04.600]  It was absolutely not a mistake to lift the ban.
[59:04.600 --> 59:09.880]  I think that sometimes you really need disruptive action if you're trying to make change.
[59:09.880 --> 59:15.280]  He arrogantly goes on to say that if the people vote to reinstate the camping ban, which has
[59:15.280 --> 59:18.760]  since happened, that nothing will change.
[59:18.760 --> 59:23.080]  So I'm concerned about it passing and creating an expectation in some parts of our community
[59:23.080 --> 59:28.880]  that somehow or another these people will at that point disappear because they won't.
[59:28.880 --> 59:34.520]  Some of these so-called homeless people are camping outside Austin City Hall, where they
[59:34.520 --> 59:37.760]  openly brag about going to war with the police.
[59:37.760 --> 59:42.200]  If it's a war they want, if it's a war they go to war.
[59:42.200 --> 59:48.640]  BLM supporter and Travis County DA, Trudy Strasburger, recently posted a job ad looking
[59:48.640 --> 59:54.760]  for a heavy hitter who is looking to prosecute police officers.
[59:54.760 --> 1:00:01.960]  Austin City Council has brazenly decided to defund the police by $150 million.
[1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:07.080]  This, along with having the streets filled with desperate transients, has naturally resulted
[1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:12.680]  in a sharp increase of violent crimes, robberies and murders.
[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:19.680]  Adler even joked with Joe Rogan how he succeeded at slowing Austin's growth by importing crime.
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:24.680]  You know, but as I explained to people, there's only one way to really stop a city from growing.
[1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:25.680]  Bring in crime.
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:26.680]  Bring in crime.
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:29.440]  Make it a desirable place to live.
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:31.440]  Order out of chaos.
[1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:36.040]  This is the job of Adler and his radical city council.
[1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:40.400]  Destroy Texas from within and it's working.
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:46.640]  Our election system has been subverted and the population so brainwashed that Texans
[1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:52.800]  will likely elect Hollywood movie star Matthew McConaughey to be their next governor, proving
[1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:57.360]  once and for all that Texas is finished.
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:02.480]  If you don't think they can turn Texas into California, just give it a few years.
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:06.320]  The enemy's resolve seems to be far greater than our own.
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:10.720]  When radical local governments ignore the will of the people and the people no longer
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:19.520]  have a vote, then the only hope for survival is to stand up against them.
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:23.520]  They import crime to have a giant army they control, just like the left's bringing all
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:25.200]  the Muslims into Europe.
[1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:28.640]  The full report will Texas resist a communist takeover?
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:30.360]  It's powerful.
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:32.240]  It's got 200,000 views just today.
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:33.800]  It needs to get 10 million views.
[1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:37.040]  Please share it on your email, your text message while you still can.
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:39.200]  Please share it on Facebook, Twitter, everywhere else.
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:42.560]  You can share it from the URL that they're not blocking at this point.
[1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:43.920]  They are blocking Band-Aid video.
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:51.600]  The same URL leaves you with all the same videos, and that is freeworldnews.tv, freeworldnews.tv.
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:25.840]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:31.920]  We are running right now, the Memorial Day special for the next week only with store-wide
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:38.400]  free shipping, double-patriot points, and DNA Force Plus is back in stock, sold out
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:45.400]  for 7 months, 40% off, Supermobile mentality, 50% off, Prostigar 40% off, Album Power 50%,
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:51.400]  Ultra 1200%, VazOV 50%, free shipping, and Patriot points, and it comes in full-war,
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:56.400]  and it's incredible products, and George Soros hates it!
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:03:16.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:22.400]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:30.400]  All right, we have next hour in studio a gentleman joining us to work in a lot of parts of the
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:38.400]  world in arm special operations for the co-host of the popular Drinking Bros podcast in Holloway,
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:42.400]  and he is going to break here exclusive news.
[1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:44.400]  They already put some of it out last week on their show.
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:45.400]  It became national news.
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:53.400]  They've got even more news dealing with exactly who is smuggling the children illegally inside
[1:03:53.400 --> 1:03:58.400]  of the United States, and believe me, when this comes up next hour, it's going to blow
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:03:59.400]  you away.
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:06.400]  They have photos, they have video, they have this from people inside the entire situation,
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:13.400]  so you definitely do not want to miss that information coming up with Dan Holloway of
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.400]  American Patriot Party podcast and DrinkingBros.com.
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:22.400]  We're going to show you all the photos, the video, and it dovetails with our research,
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:26.400]  all the footage we got down in South Texas on the Mexico border as well.
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:31.400]  So look for that to happen coming up.
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:36.400]  Now, Vox Day has been a frequent guest of ours, it's been like a year's gone by, in
[1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:37.400]  like five seconds.
[1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:38.400]  He had been on in a year.
[1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:42.400]  Vox Day is the best-selling author of SJW's Always Line, SJW has always doubled down.
[1:04:42.400 --> 1:04:47.400]  He is the lead editor of Castilla House and a major comic book distributor.
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:49.400]  He's got some new comic books coming out right now.
[1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:52.400]  We'll tell you about them in the last seven today, archaven.com.
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:56.400]  It's a great way to reach out to the young people, but he also lives over in Europe.
[1:04:56.400 --> 1:05:05.400]  I wanted to get his take on the whole geopolitical machinations that are unfolding, the COVID
[1:05:05.400 --> 1:05:11.400]  launch, Fauci and Gates in Trouble, all the information that's unfolding.
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:16.400]  Putin's top advisors coming out and saying there's a new world order of Satanists that
[1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:22.400]  want to destroy the planet and they've taken over America and they're the same Bolsheviks
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:23.400]  that took over in Russia.
[1:05:23.400 --> 1:05:25.400]  I mean, this stuff is on the Russian news.
[1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:27.400]  People don't know that here.
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:30.400]  Vladimir Putin, the new order worships Satan.
[1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.400]  Putin's former chief of staff, Trump was modern.
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:35.400]  George Washington reveals why globalists hated him.
[1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:41.400]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:43.400]  That wild card of Russia as well.
[1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:49.400]  And I know that Vox Day has looked into a lot of that.
[1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:53.400]  So we're going to cover it all here today and kind of get that 35,000 foot view because
[1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:59.400]  he's a smart guy about what he expects to come next with Biden, the public that can hardly
[1:05:59.400 --> 1:06:05.400]  talk, dissolving the borders, announcing we can't produce any mining here in the U.S.
[1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:08.400]  It's just incredible actions of war.
[1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:11.400]  Why Vox Day, and it's great to have you back with us.
[1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:16.400]  Would the system be now getting ready to bring out the Wuhan lab-made truth?
[1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:18.400]  Why are they burning Fauci?
[1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:19.400]  Why are they burning Gates?
[1:06:19.400 --> 1:06:21.400]  What do you think that's really all about?
[1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:23.400]  Thanks for joining us.
[1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:26.400]  Hey, Alex, it's good to see you again.
[1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:36.400]  I think what's happening now is that the plan to bring about the New World Order in a relatively
[1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:45.400]  easy frog boiling in the gradually increasing temperature water failed.
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:55.400]  What we're seeing is increasingly a desperate attempt to try to get things in place in a
[1:06:55.400 --> 1:07:03.400]  way that they can't be destroyed because their original plans fell apart.
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:12.400]  If you look at the history of the last two or 300 years, and I've been reading an excellent
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:18.400]  book called Stalin's War that's very eye-opening about the history of World War II, the true
[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:20.400]  history of World War II.
[1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:30.400]  What you see is that these Prometheans, as I call them, the devil worshipers that Putin
[1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:40.400]  points out and has called out, they have gone from empire to empire using it to foster
[1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:42.400]  their long-term plans.
[1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:54.400]  They were in the British Empire, then when the U.S. rose, they began to attempt to influence
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:57.400]  the development of the U.S. Empire.
[1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:06.400]  They did the same thing in the Soviet Union, but about maybe 10 years ago, it became clear
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:13.400]  that their attempt to jump to China was failing.
[1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:21.400]  I don't know because obviously I'm not privy to these things, but it looks to me as if the
[1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:29.400]  Chinese nationalists understood what was happening and rejected them at the same time that the
[1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:35.400]  Russian people managed to clear out the remnants that had been installed in the post-Soviet
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:37.400]  Union during the Yeltsin years.
[1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:48.400]  The fact that the United States and Britain still remain largely under the influence of,
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:56.400]  for lack of a better term, we'll just call the globalist lobby.
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:03.400]  It's a difficult position for them because the USA is failing and it's no longer capable
[1:09:03.400 --> 1:09:07.400]  of pushing the rest of the world around.
[1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:12.400]  That's why I think you're seeing what is essentially a globalist Hail Mary attempt.
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:16.400]  I 100% agree with that brief on-target analysis.
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:23.400]  I just spent an hour trying to babble that out, but this is an epic moment to see them
[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:29.400]  try to discredit Trump, discredit Bolsonaro, try to get people like Boris Johnson as an
[1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:34.400]  opportunist, back under their control, try to discredit Brexit, and then to see Kerry,
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:39.400]  John Kerry, and to see them admitting that we're using COVID to lock things down, to
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:44.400]  defeat nationalists, to defeat the Yelovest, to defeat Bolsonaro, they still have that arrogance
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:50.400]  where they talk at Davos and talk in their own statements at the CFR about bribing people
[1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:53.400]  and getting Ukrainian officials fired.
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:56.400]  Son of a bitch, he was fired two hours later.
[1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:02.400]  It's still crazy that I understand they brag because that makes it look like they're invincible
[1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:03.400]  to their minions.
[1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:08.400]  It's part of the bravada, part of the confidence game, but don't they get now that it's not
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:10.400]  working anymore?
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:17.400]  Well, I think that they're beginning to understand that on some level, but they're used to having
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:25.400]  setbacks and they're used to things going badly because they ultimately report to
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:37.400]  creatures that are not subject to human life spans because they literally worship what
[1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.400]  Christians call the devil.
[1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:43.400]  The important thing to understand, that's why I call them Prometheans, they don't see
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:44.400]  it that way.
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.400]  They don't see themselves as being Satan worshipers.
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:49.400]  They think that they're light printers.
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:50.400]  You're right.
[1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:54.400]  I say that, devil worshipers, that's the term the public knows.
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:55.400]  You're right.
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:59.400]  They believe they're becoming gods like Prometheans and they believe we're going to be punished
[1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:04.400]  for the fact that we're trying to become gods and that this great pain is part of that Promethean
[1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:05.400]  struggle.
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:08.400]  Yeah, it's just the birthing process.
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:16.400]  When you look at the way that they're constantly talking about ascending and they're constantly
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:22.400]  talking about progress and they're constantly talking about bringing about a better world,
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:29.400]  there's so much bringing about a better world propaganda right now.
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:36.400]  Practically every television show or movie that you'll see now incorporates that line
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:37.400]  somehow.
[1:11:37.400 --> 1:11:46.400]  The Nevers, which is the new Joss Whedon show, they must have used that line bringing about
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:50.400]  a better world, something like 10 times in a single episode.
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:56.800]  It's clearly the sort of hypnotic programming approach.
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:12:01.600]  That's the plan, but of course no battle plan survives contact with the enemy.
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:07.480]  The problem that they have is that their plan is wildly unrealistic.
[1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:09.560]  It's totally contrary to nature.
[1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:11.440]  It's totally contrary to God.
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:20.240]  It's totally contrary to what 98%, maybe 99% of all human beings actually want.
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:28.600]  That's why you're seeing the rise of transgenderism and you're seeing the rise of eat the bugs
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:33.560]  instead of the beef.
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:40.040]  It's intentional insanity because it is a rejection of reality.
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:42.840]  It's a rejection of nature.
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:45.440]  It's a rejection of God.
[1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:50.880]  A very wise Italian admiral will stay right there when he comes back.
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:51.880]  Fascinating.
[1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:52.880]  It is literally a desecration.
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:53.880]  We're right back.
[1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:59.560]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:01.360]  the third world dies.
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:06.120]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:11.280]  shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:12.800]  and really hurt the first world.
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:16.920]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:20.560]  That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:23.080]  done before delivering gas have been shut down.
[1:13:23.080 --> 1:13:26.600]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines.
[1:13:26.600 --> 1:13:30.120]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:31.240]  We're being shut down.
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:33.280]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[1:13:33.280 --> 1:13:36.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:37.600]  The third world is imploding as well.
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:38.600]  The borders have been removed.
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:42.880]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-kong takeover, Gregory said, you have
[1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:43.880]  no hope.
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:48.880]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:52.320]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you
[1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:57.480]  and your family.
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:59.480]  Your voice counts.
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:04.480]  When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:07.080]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:08.600]  They know you're angry.
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:12.880]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:13.880]  we've got.
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:18.120]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can

[1:15:47.000 --> 1:16:00.280]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to 833-470-0438.
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:03.280]  And I want you to give us a quote, but here's two examples.
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:07.840]  The mayor of Austin just came out in the Joe Rogan interview, I played it earlier before
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:11.280]  you came on, and he said, we've imported crime to stop growth.
[1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:12.280]  We want to hurt people.
[1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:14.320]  We want things to be bad.
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:16.840]  That's their Machiavellian view.
[1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:18.360]  That's why the blue cities are like this on purpose.
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:19.360]  They do this on purpose.
[1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:22.200]  They order the police to let the drug dealing happen, all of it.
[1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:28.080]  And it's just like the, a credo in Canada said, I want to be a dictator like China.
[1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:29.080]  That's a quote.
[1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:30.480]  I want to be a woman who gets very excited by it.
[1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:34.120]  So yeah, we're going to cut your boys' genitals off, and we're going to call it loving and
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:35.120]  liberal.
[1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:37.480]  I mean, if you did that 20 years ago, you'd be put in prison.
[1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:42.520]  So yeah, there's a war on God, a war on reality, and an attempt to just gaslight us into this
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:43.840]  position right now.
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:44.840]  Please continue.
[1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:53.680]  Well, I was having dinner with some Italian army officers, one of whom was, his father
[1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:57.920]  was an admiral, and he happened to have joined us.
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:06.680]  It was interesting because, you know, there's a strong intellectual element to the Italian
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:08.760]  officers' education.
[1:17:08.760 --> 1:17:11.320]  They tend to be very well read.
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:18.440]  And this admiral said, well, you know, at the end of the day, every political discussion
[1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:23.560]  ultimately comes down to Aristotle or Plato.
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:26.160]  And yeah, that's true.
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:28.080]  It's absolutely true.
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:35.080]  You and I, Alex, were very much Aristotelians.
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:40.080]  The Prometheans and so forth are very much Platonists.
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:42.600]  But there's a deeper element.
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:47.840]  And it's one that a lot of very smart, very bright people whose hearts are in the right
[1:17:47.840 --> 1:17:53.720]  place, whose minds are in the right place, are not able to understand or comprehend because
[1:17:53.720 --> 1:17:57.480]  their eyes are blinded to the spiritual realities.
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:06.960]  And when you look at the spiritual realities, you see from the beginning that the Tower
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:10.560]  of Babel never ended.
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:13.560]  That's why the European Union building looks like the Tower of Babel.
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:15.200]  It's not just an homage.
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:18.400]  It's precisely the same empire.
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:26.160]  You know, Philip K. Dick actually wrote about it, he called it the empire that never ended.
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:34.080]  And the various empires that we see, the British Empire, the US Empire, the Soviet Empire,
[1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:38.120]  those are all supposed to be iterations of it.
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:43.760]  They're tools, but they're also the sort of public fist of it.
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:51.200]  I suspect that, like I said, the whole plan went awry because China was supposed to be
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:53.200]  the next empire.
[1:18:53.200 --> 1:19:01.200]  But I don't think that in the same way that the Prometheans did not expect Donald Trump,
[1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:05.240]  I don't think they expected President Xi.
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:14.320]  If she is very, very anti-corruption for all of his, shall we say, idiosyncrasies that
[1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:21.200]  we in the West might not appreciate, he's incredibly anti-corruption.
[1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:25.160]  And that's not amenable to the empire.
[1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:26.160]  And so I think that that's where-
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:30.240]  Well, isn't that the big criticism of globalism's lofty goal of peace and world government that's
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:34.720]  for the lower level minions that are in it, but have been led into basically partly understanding
[1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:39.320]  as they never fulfill their plans of empowering people, it's all about enslaving, they never
[1:19:39.320 --> 1:19:42.880]  go through on their deals, they're always stealing, they're the opposite of what they
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:44.880]  claim they're doing.
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:45.880]  Exactly.
[1:19:45.880 --> 1:19:48.400]  I mean, they're the epitome of corruption.
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:52.000]  They're the epitome of lies and dishonesty.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.800]  They never deliver what they promise to the world.
[1:19:56.800 --> 1:20:08.160]  And so that's why a leader like Donald Trump, a leader like Xin Sheng Xi, or I apologize,
[1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:16.160]  I don't have his first name correct, but a leader like Xi, leaders like even someone
[1:20:16.160 --> 1:20:27.640]  like Bolsonaro or Matteo Salvini in Italy, those are people who are too upright in at
[1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:36.560]  least some manner to bend the knee to the corruption that is required for the globalists
[1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:37.560]  to-
[1:20:37.560 --> 1:20:38.560]  Well, exactly.
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:41.960]  Xi will execute you if you try to teach a kid to be transgender, and I'm not defending
[1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:46.120]  all the other stuff he does, but at least he has a code he follows, and it's not the
[1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:51.240]  exact code the globalists want, that is to just mutilate and vandalize God's creation.
[1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:52.740]  Precisely.
[1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:54.240]  And Putin is the same way.
[1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:06.280]  Putin is a very fearsome individual, but he also has a very strong moral code, and I
[1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:12.560]  believe it might even be a strong Christian code based on some of the stuff that he said.
[1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:20.520]  And so when you have world leaders of this caliber, they are capable of standing up to
[1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:26.600]  rejecting and completely destroying the plans of the globalists, which is why I believe
[1:21:26.600 --> 1:21:37.400]  they needed to go to this ridiculous attempt to transform what is the flu into a pandemic
[1:21:37.400 --> 1:21:44.240]  and then this mass vaccination campaign that only God knows, only God and the devil knows
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:49.200]  what's really involved in all of that.
[1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:53.320]  Where do you think this is going with Bill Gates, obviously falling from grace, not being
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:59.480]  in a leadership position, carrying out the medical tyranny, Fauci now in a lot of trouble,
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:01.080]  where do you see that going?
[1:22:01.080 --> 1:22:10.400]  Well, I think it's going to become a revolutionary, there's going to be revolutionary potential
[1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:19.120]  once people who have been vaccinated understand what has actually been done to them.
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:29.080]  And I think that you're going to see an incredible amount of chaos because chaos is what order
[1:22:29.080 --> 1:22:35.880]  comes out of, and since their orderly plan failed, I believe that this is the chaotic
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:42.560]  plan to attempt to restore their- Exactly, this is going to destabilize the whole planet
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:45.040]  and their main target was Western Christian countries.
[1:22:45.040 --> 1:22:49.680]  And notice, China and India will not take any of the West vaccines because they're not
[1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:50.680]  vaccines.
[1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:58.160]  Oh yeah, they know better, and they understand that there's no way that anyone with half
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:03.880]  a brain would voluntarily accept to be injected with this stuff.
[1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:10.600]  I mean, I don't know exactly what it does, but I do know that it's not a vaccine by definition,
[1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:16.920]  and I do know that if you don't eat GMO foods, you damn sure shouldn't be modifying yourself.
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:21.920]  Well, this just attacks all the replicating cells, everything but your eyes.
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:25.640]  The rods and cones in your eyes, every damn cell in your body, except for eggs and a woman's
[1:23:25.640 --> 1:23:30.360]  ovaries and in your eye cells, are dividing and replicating, and this damn thing attacks
[1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:31.360]  it all.
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:34.120]  I mean, I guess the enamel in your teeth will be immune from it.
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:38.440]  That's it, your eyes are enamel in your teeth and women's eggs, but it's going to attack
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:43.280]  the sheath on the ovaries, though, they'll be right back with Vox Day, really smart cookie.
[1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:44.920]  Why has he been on over a year?
[1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:46.840]  I won't get this guy on more often.
[1:23:46.840 --> 1:24:09.920]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person, and so as bad as things are with the
[1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:23.040]  hands that I have, my people all the time have their head down, and I now know that
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:28.320]  they will have a center for their removal.
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:35.340]  I want to see that, but the sheath has happened over million people in Hollywood, over more
[1:24:35.340 --> 1:24:40.180]  what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for to show
[1:24:40.180 --> 1:24:45.500]  people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job, so please
[1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:50.740]  keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can meet the shock groups in the Information

[1:27:57.460 --> 1:28:25.460]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:25.460 --> 1:28:42.340]  My friends, you've got to realize that we're not making this up. And there's this process
[1:28:42.340 --> 1:28:47.820]  happening where something I've talked about in Vox. Dave's talked about and so many others
[1:28:47.820 --> 1:28:52.540]  have talked about over the years. He's even doing this a long time as well. He's all coming
[1:28:52.540 --> 1:28:57.060]  out in the open now. And people are thinking, wow, you're not joking about this. I mean,
[1:28:57.060 --> 1:29:05.260]  Dr. Tenpenny's respected. But I've read the reports by Wolfgang Wudarg, the top advisor
[1:29:05.260 --> 1:29:11.340]  to the EU, and the former head scientist at Pfizer, who just retired a few years ago in
[1:29:11.340 --> 1:29:16.700]  good graces, saying this will start killing people in mass within six months to a year.
[1:29:16.700 --> 1:29:21.020]  It'll cause blood clots. It'll grow tumors all over you. And then all of a sudden they're
[1:29:21.020 --> 1:29:24.860]  growing tumors everywhere and they're going, well, don't worry about tumors in your uterus
[1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:29.420]  or in your lymph nodes. And then they're going into doing emergency surgeries on people and
[1:29:29.420 --> 1:29:34.980]  admitting the vaccine caused it. And supermodels are dying of strokes right after they take
[1:29:34.980 --> 1:29:41.020]  it. I mean, it's every hour we're seeing someone prominent die. Why would you launch something
[1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:49.300]  like this knowing in the studies Fauci did at UT in 2012 with similar vaccines for coronaviruses
[1:29:49.300 --> 1:29:53.980]  that it causes them to tackle that protein in the body? How would you, unless you were
[1:29:53.980 --> 1:29:57.780]  just trying to create total chaos? And then how do they think they're going to get away
[1:29:57.780 --> 1:30:01.460]  with that? Well, people don't understand that these Prometheans are psychotics, they're
[1:30:01.460 --> 1:30:07.700]  mad scientists. And that's why in every James Comet book movie they make, they tell you
[1:30:07.700 --> 1:30:12.700]  it's a mad scientist doing it who can't help themselves and does this. Well, why is that
[1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:18.060]  the plot to all this? Because they love to tell you with revelation of the method, predictive
[1:30:18.060 --> 1:30:21.740]  programming, what they're doing. And so the bigger question is getting into the mindsets
[1:30:21.740 --> 1:30:24.580]  of these people because so many folks are like, who cares about their mindsets? Let's
[1:30:24.580 --> 1:30:29.340]  stop them understanding their mindset. I found is how you wake the public up because the
[1:30:29.340 --> 1:30:34.060]  general public doesn't operate like this. And so they have trouble understanding why
[1:30:34.060 --> 1:30:41.860]  people do things like this box day. That's absolutely right. And the reason that they
[1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:47.900]  talk about things ahead of time is because they need to normalize them. If you just start
[1:30:47.900 --> 1:30:56.420]  off from scratch and you say, Hey, Jimmy, why don't you cut off your genitals and start
[1:30:56.420 --> 1:31:04.180]  wearing a dress? That's not going to go over very well. It requires literally decades of
[1:31:04.180 --> 1:31:11.580]  intellectual softening up. It requires literally decades of narrative shifting. And that's
[1:31:11.580 --> 1:31:19.900]  why they place such importance on Hollywood, or as I usually refer to it the hell mouth.
[1:31:19.900 --> 1:31:27.940]  And it's why they focus so much on controlling all of the entertainment across the West.
[1:31:27.940 --> 1:31:35.700]  And this is also, of course, why China refuses to let them have free entry into the Chinese
[1:31:35.700 --> 1:31:43.420]  entertainment system because they understand that it is a vital entry point for that. And
[1:31:43.420 --> 1:31:51.580]  the way that we beat them, we don't just stop them. We have to continue to push our own
[1:31:51.580 --> 1:31:59.780]  competing narratives. You can't defeat rhetoric with dialectic. You can't defeat the unthinking
[1:31:59.780 --> 1:32:09.820]  influence of a comic book with a very important essay from a think tank on national review.
[1:32:09.820 --> 1:32:16.820]  You have to fight fire with fire. That's why we started Arkhaven because we saw what they
[1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:24.780]  were doing now that they had control of Marvel, now that they had control of DC. And we thought,
[1:32:24.780 --> 1:32:31.420]  hey, they're going to go and attack the good, the beautiful, and the true. They're going
[1:32:31.420 --> 1:32:39.420]  to pervert it and turn it into the evil, the ugly, and the lie. And so we created Arkhaven
[1:32:39.420 --> 1:32:46.100]  and we've been, as you know, publishing comics for a couple of years now. We've just launched
[1:32:46.100 --> 1:32:52.140]  this new site called ArcTunes where everything is free. It's totally subscriber supported.
[1:32:52.140 --> 1:33:01.500]  There's actually more content on ArcTunes in a month than DC Comics publishes in a month.
[1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:07.060]  And so I'd encourage all of your viewers, even if you're not at all into comic books,
[1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:13.140]  I mean, look at my library. Do I look like I'm a big comics book guy? I'm more inclined
[1:33:13.140 --> 1:33:19.580]  to read Dante in the original Italian than I am to read an old copy of the Fantastic
[1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:27.700]  Four. But I understand the importance of narrative and explain the union psychology.
[1:33:27.700 --> 1:33:36.980]  You didn't invent this. Plato didn't invent this. I mean, obviously, the Hagel didn't
[1:33:36.980 --> 1:33:40.980]  invent the dialectic. They just took what was already there and gave it names. But the
[1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:46.500]  globalists are obsessed with programming our subconscious. And so absolutely, you can't
[1:33:46.500 --> 1:33:49.940]  reach somebody with a white paper where the globalists admit they're doing this. But if
[1:33:49.940 --> 1:33:53.660]  you do it in a skit or you do it in a movie or you do it in a comic book form, then they
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:56.100]  totally get it. They're threatened by that.
[1:33:56.100 --> 1:34:01.220]  Well, yeah, absolutely. And they're very focused on controlling it. Like, for example,
[1:34:01.220 --> 1:34:10.100]  a Asian company started a similar company called Tapas. And they're about, I don't know, their
[1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:14.940]  traffic is about 10 times larger than theirs, although their most successful comics are
[1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:19.000]  only get about three or four times the traffic.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:26.660]  They were just purchased for $150 million. Now, that's insane. Why would you ever pay
[1:34:26.660 --> 1:34:36.020]  that much money for a second tier digital comic site that literally doesn't have any
[1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:40.900]  major or even particularly good comics on it, right? Well, the reason is because it's
[1:34:40.900 --> 1:34:46.100]  important for them to control the narrative. That's why Disney paid $4 billion for Star
[1:34:46.100 --> 1:34:53.580]  Wars. That's why they paid $4 billion for Marvel. And the only way that you avoid it
[1:34:53.580 --> 1:35:00.380]  is if you have people that are not just interested. Yeah, I mean, look at the art on Tapas there
[1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:07.140]  and then compare it to the art that's on art tunes. You can see that our stuff is significantly
[1:35:07.140 --> 1:35:15.220]  better. And also, look at how that was all lesbian, LBGT, whatever stuff. Whereas we're
[1:35:15.220 --> 1:35:20.980]  doing the actual traditional superhero stuff. Well, they're also rewarding that. Explain
[1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:28.340]  to people why the cover that's all over the store, Skittles, Levi's is Pride Week, telling
[1:35:28.340 --> 1:35:33.380]  you that you're not really human. Him, he, she, they, them, add your own pronouns that
[1:35:33.380 --> 1:35:39.340]  it says open your heart to love when you when you open the box to the children and then
[1:35:39.340 --> 1:35:43.780]  you get some, you know, toxic GMO garbage. I mean, this is a full assault not about love
[1:35:43.780 --> 1:35:48.180]  and unity, but about people being alone and not having families and about not having children.
[1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:56.580]  It's about death. Exactly. And how are you going to fight that cereal box with a important
[1:35:56.580 --> 1:36:04.500]  essay published on national review? You're not. You can't. And that's why every attempt
[1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:10.580]  by the conservatives to try to fight this stuff by saying, Hey, look at how bad the
[1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:16.060]  left is. And the thing that's so stupid and frustrating about it is it doesn't have anything
[1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:21.500]  to do with the left per se. It doesn't have anything to do with politics per se. It has
[1:36:21.500 --> 1:36:28.900]  to do with the most fundamental aspects of good and evil. It ultimately has to do with
[1:36:28.900 --> 1:36:34.300]  do you serve the God of this world or do you serve Jesus Christ? And let's quantify that
[1:36:34.300 --> 1:36:39.340]  because the globalist aren't wrong. The globalist aren't idiots. They're not environmentalist
[1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:45.100]  wackos. They're conquerors by overthrowing logic and goodness, sabotaging us. So we're
[1:36:45.100 --> 1:36:50.460]  even more fallen than them. So they can take control of us. They are saboteurs and they
[1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:55.580]  know they are and they are the enemy and anyone that joins them is delusional. All you get
[1:36:55.580 --> 1:37:01.420]  is failure joining Satan. Oh, absolutely. I mean, I tell people, look, even if you're
[1:37:01.420 --> 1:37:09.300]  not a Christian and even if you don't worship Jesus Christ and rely on him for your salvation,
[1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:15.140]  at the very least, you should support Western civilization because you know what? We have
[1:37:15.140 --> 1:37:20.860]  flush toilets because that's what you're going to give up. Everybody's trying to get
[1:37:20.860 --> 1:37:24.340]  in to get that, but the globalists are going to use what comes from outside to actually
[1:37:24.340 --> 1:37:28.100]  destroy that because it's like floating debris in a wrecked ship. They don't want any of
[1:37:28.100 --> 1:37:33.340]  us to get back to land. They want to sink everything. Precisely. And that's why I coined
[1:37:33.340 --> 1:37:40.220]  the term magic dirt. You know, a lot of conservatives think, well, as long as everybody, you know,
[1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:44.580]  thinks the right thing and wants to live here, then they're going to be just like every other
[1:37:44.580 --> 1:37:49.540]  American. Well, that's not true. You know, the dirt is not magic. It didn't turn the
[1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:56.700]  white European settlers into Indians. I don't really need to sell you on how beat concentrate
[1:37:56.700 --> 1:38:00.700]  is really good for your heart, good for your liver, good for your lungs, good for your cardiovascular
[1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:05.700]  system, your brain. It's well known. And so beat supplements are amongst the best sellers
[1:38:05.700 --> 1:38:10.980]  out there. So I went out to a top lab and I said, what is the strongest beat concentrate?
[1:38:10.980 --> 1:38:15.340]  We can do a copy of the popular formula you have. They explained that their formula had
[1:38:15.340 --> 1:38:19.260]  a certain percentage. And I said, just like with bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, where
[1:38:19.260 --> 1:38:23.660]  the average competitor is at five percent or humanoid, I said, no one else does 95. That's
[1:38:23.660 --> 1:38:28.380]  the highest level. I said, give me 95 percent or humanoid didn't even cost much more. And
[1:38:28.380 --> 1:38:33.380]  we have 95 percent humanoid. Well, it's the same thing here. This is a very strong beat
[1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:37.220]  extract. And it's very good for your body, good for your heart. And it's back in stock,

[1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:25.500]  Triple 8, 2 by 3, 3 1, 3 9, is the info war store hotline
[1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:51.500]  If a war store dot com is simply the best, infowarstore dot com beats out all the rest.
[1:39:51.500 --> 1:39:53.500]  That's infowarstore dot com.
[1:39:53.500 --> 1:39:58.500]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast.
[1:39:58.500 --> 1:40:02.500]  And then I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[1:40:02.500 --> 1:40:05.500]  Yes, I can spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed
[1:40:05.500 --> 1:40:10.500]  and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in.
[1:40:10.500 --> 1:40:14.500]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:17.500]  and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try to make people wear masks.
[1:40:17.500 --> 1:40:22.500]  I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news
[1:40:22.500 --> 1:40:24.500]  concerning the infowar?
[1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:28.500]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now the Memorial Day Special
[1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:34.500]  for the next week only with store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points,
[1:40:34.500 --> 1:40:37.500]  and DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:40.500]  It's sold out for seven months, 40% off.
[1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:42.500]  SuperMobileTallity, 50% off.
[1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:44.500]  Prostigard, 40% off.
[1:40:44.500 --> 1:40:45.500]  AlphaPower, 50% off.
[1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:46.500]  Ultra12, 50% off.
[1:40:46.500 --> 1:40:47.500]  Vasov, 50% off.
[1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:49.500]  FreeShipping and Patriot Points.
[1:40:49.500 --> 1:40:53.500]  And it comes in full-war, and it's incredible products, and George Soros hates it!
[1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:54.500]  Ha-ha!
[1:40:54.500 --> 1:40:57.500]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold out
[1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:00.500]  for three months, four months, six months, seven months,
[1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:02.500]  it's not a gimmick to make you buy the products.
[1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:07.500]  I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements
[1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:10.500]  and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation
[1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:13.500]  because they're great products that we're coming back and getting more and thank you for the support.
[1:41:13.500 --> 1:41:20.500]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's PolymBlock or whether it's SuperMobileTallity or VasovBeats,
[1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:23.500]  because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world,
[1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:27.500]  we're not going to lower the quality of our products, and so we just can't offer them.
[1:41:27.500 --> 1:41:31.500]  But thank God, it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now
[1:41:31.500 --> 1:41:35.500]  because suddenly a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[1:41:35.500 --> 1:41:37.500]  And one of them is PolymBlock.
[1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:41.500]  It takes a long time to get into PolymBlock, but it's for seasonal discomfort,
[1:41:41.500 --> 1:41:43.500]  stuff like allergies.
[1:41:43.500 --> 1:41:44.500]  It's from France.
[1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:46.500]  It's a special proprietary system.
[1:41:46.500 --> 1:41:50.500]  This is the highest quality, back in stock, infowarstore.com,
[1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:53.500]  store-wide free shipping, and double-patriot points. Check it out.
[1:41:53.500 --> 1:42:08.500]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:42:08.500 --> 1:42:23.500]  Well, we've got to get Box Day to cover us for four hours sometime.
[1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:26.500]  We're doing a longer, more free podcast on Saturday with me,
[1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:28.500]  because you've got a lot of irons in the fire.
[1:42:28.500 --> 1:42:30.500]  A lot of great stuff he's doing. He's a very smart guy.
[1:42:30.500 --> 1:42:33.500]  I want to get more into these comic books because as adults,
[1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:36.500]  and we're more cerebral, we like to look at that,
[1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:38.500]  but even adults nowadays are into comic books,
[1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:42.500]  and it's so rare to see something that isn't the globalist brainwashing
[1:42:42.500 --> 1:42:44.500]  that people really snap these up.
[1:42:44.500 --> 1:42:46.500]  In fact, we sell the hard copies of their comic books
[1:42:46.500 --> 1:42:48.500]  at infowarstore.com from Alt Hero.
[1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:52.500]  He can't even keep those in stock, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:52.500 --> 1:42:54.500]  And so now they've gone digital with a bunch of their work,
[1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:55.500]  and it's exploding.
[1:42:55.500 --> 1:42:59.500]  We'll talk about archaibn.com here in a moment with Box Day.
[1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:02.500]  But separately, big picture.
[1:43:02.500 --> 1:43:04.500]  What do you expect to happen with them getting ready
[1:43:04.500 --> 1:43:07.500]  to indict Trump's inner circle and then indict him out of New York?
[1:43:07.500 --> 1:43:08.500]  Obviously pressure.
[1:43:08.500 --> 1:43:11.500]  How do they do that while Biden and the laptop and the Chinese,
[1:43:11.500 --> 1:43:13.500]  and how obvious this is?
[1:43:13.500 --> 1:43:19.500]  What other shoes to drop are you expecting to see?
[1:43:19.500 --> 1:43:26.500]  Well, I'm expecting that Biden's not going to probably
[1:43:26.500 --> 1:43:29.500]  make it to the end of his term.
[1:43:29.500 --> 1:43:36.500]  And I think that that's going to set off a lot of...
[1:43:36.500 --> 1:43:39.500]  I mean, his health is just not good.
[1:43:39.500 --> 1:43:42.500]  I don't know if you've ever been unfortunate enough
[1:43:42.500 --> 1:43:44.500]  to know somebody with dementia,
[1:43:44.500 --> 1:43:49.500]  but once they start going downhill, it tends to be pretty rapid.
[1:43:49.500 --> 1:43:52.500]  It accelerates, and they kind of dip down, go up a little,
[1:43:52.500 --> 1:43:54.500]  but then dip down even more,
[1:43:54.500 --> 1:43:55.500]  and one day they're sitting there nice,
[1:43:55.500 --> 1:43:58.500]  the next day they're writing on the walls of their feces.
[1:43:58.500 --> 1:44:04.500]  Yeah, and what we've seen out of Joe Biden
[1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:08.500]  tends to indicate somebody who is further along the process
[1:44:08.500 --> 1:44:14.500]  than let's say you would want to see your grandparents
[1:44:14.500 --> 1:44:17.500]  or your parents.
[1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:20.500]  And so it's going to be very interesting there
[1:44:20.500 --> 1:44:27.500]  because obviously Harris is not a serious individual.
[1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:32.500]  She's a very loathsome person.
[1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:34.500]  Well, I think she must be.
[1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:38.500]  I don't know much about her other than the obvious biography,
[1:44:38.500 --> 1:44:42.500]  but the fact that she was so wildly unpopular,
[1:44:42.500 --> 1:44:44.500]  even among the Democrats,
[1:44:44.500 --> 1:44:50.500]  I don't see how it will be possible for her to...
[1:44:50.500 --> 1:44:53.500]  Exactly, she comes off as totally fake and disingenuous
[1:44:53.500 --> 1:44:57.500]  and synthetic, even more revolting than the cryptkeeper,
[1:44:57.500 --> 1:44:59.500]  Biden, why do the engineers do that?
[1:44:59.500 --> 1:45:01.500]  Why did they put her in?
[1:45:01.500 --> 1:45:03.500]  Why do they love her so much?
[1:45:03.500 --> 1:45:08.500]  Because she's somebody who has kissed the ring.
[1:45:08.500 --> 1:45:13.500]  She's somebody who has indicated that she's willing to take orders.
[1:45:13.500 --> 1:45:16.500]  And maybe that's enough.
[1:45:16.500 --> 1:45:19.500]  Maybe that's all they think they need,
[1:45:19.500 --> 1:45:23.500]  but I think that what they're going to find
[1:45:23.500 --> 1:45:28.500]  is that the more that Americans find out
[1:45:28.500 --> 1:45:31.500]  about what is actually going on around the world,
[1:45:31.500 --> 1:45:36.500]  the more that they're going to turn to the nationalist right
[1:45:36.500 --> 1:45:43.500]  that everybody from Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro
[1:45:43.500 --> 1:45:45.500]  all the way to the Democratic left
[1:45:45.500 --> 1:45:48.500]  has been desperately trying to stop the rise of,
[1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:53.500]  but like I've said for years, it's inevitable.
[1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:58.500]  And again, I mean, I guess the way definitely Shapiro undoubtedly knows,
[1:45:58.500 --> 1:46:03.500]  I mean, he's pushed in the algorithm by Google, by Facebook, by Twitter.
[1:46:03.500 --> 1:46:06.500]  In fact, even the eternal documents come out of Google and Facebook,
[1:46:06.500 --> 1:46:08.500]  they push them harder than Democrats
[1:46:08.500 --> 1:46:11.500]  because they're supposed to be our leadership.
[1:46:11.500 --> 1:46:13.500]  Exactly, and they never will be.
[1:46:13.500 --> 1:46:16.500]  They never will be.
[1:46:16.500 --> 1:46:21.500]  There are too many people who love Jesus Christ,
[1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:24.500]  who love good, who love the beautiful, who love the true.
[1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:31.500]  They're not going to accept these absolutely fake constructions
[1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:35.500]  that are pale parodies of the truth.
[1:46:35.500 --> 1:46:38.500]  Well, I don't want to go on a jag attacking Jordan Peterson,
[1:46:38.500 --> 1:46:41.500]  but you did say he was mentally ill and crazy and had serious problems.
[1:46:41.500 --> 1:46:43.500]  Then he did have a breakdown indeed.
[1:46:43.500 --> 1:46:46.500]  I mean, I think mentally he's a lot smarter than Shapiro
[1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:49.500]  that just kind of reads real fast and that's his one trick.
[1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:51.500]  And everybody bows down and he's the genius,
[1:46:51.500 --> 1:46:53.500]  he's the enlightened one, he's the God.
[1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:55.500]  But I do see an ongoing rejection of these guys,
[1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:59.500]  but what happened with Peterson?
[1:46:59.500 --> 1:47:06.500]  Well, Peterson feels a tremendous sense of guilt for something.
[1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:08.500]  I don't know what.
[1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:13.500]  But he's not what I would call a happy ticket taker.
[1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:19.500]  He's somebody who sold his soul to the devil and wants it back,
[1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:22.500]  but he doesn't know how.
[1:47:22.500 --> 1:47:28.500]  And I think that that's the real reason for his breakdown.
[1:47:28.500 --> 1:47:30.500]  That's a great analysis.
[1:47:30.500 --> 1:47:33.500]  So who's been Shapiro?
[1:47:33.500 --> 1:47:40.500]  Well, Shapiro, he actually, he didn't want to be a media whore.
[1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:44.500]  And he did have a crisis of conscience in his early teens.
[1:47:44.500 --> 1:47:52.500]  But at some point in time, he decided to just dive in and make the best of it.
[1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:56.500]  Because for folks that don't know, from memory, he worked for you, didn't he?
[1:47:56.500 --> 1:48:01.500]  No, he didn't work for me, but we were both writers at WorldNet Daily.
[1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:07.500]  And I don't think it's too much of an exaggeration to say that he looked up to me a bit.
[1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:09.500]  Yeah, it's just incredible.
[1:48:09.500 --> 1:48:13.500]  Because if you have eyes to see, you see transparently they're hiding something.
[1:48:13.500 --> 1:48:15.500]  Plus, you see what they do.
[1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:17.500]  I mean, I would say Shapiro is far worse than Peterson.
[1:48:17.500 --> 1:48:20.500]  You would probably argue otherwise.
[1:48:20.500 --> 1:48:30.500]  No, I think that Shapiro has come to terms with the arrangement that he made.
[1:48:30.500 --> 1:48:41.500]  I think that there's still some spark of life, of love, of the truth inside Peterson
[1:48:41.500 --> 1:48:45.500]  that is horrified by the situation that he finds himself.
[1:48:45.500 --> 1:48:48.500]  But I mean, what kind of deal did he have to make in academia?
[1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:52.500]  What is the central crime that Peterson is committing?
[1:48:52.500 --> 1:48:55.500]  I mean, intellectually, spiritually.
[1:48:55.500 --> 1:48:56.500]  Well, I don't know.
[1:48:56.500 --> 1:48:58.500]  I mean, that's individual.
[1:48:58.500 --> 1:49:00.500]  But I'm saying, what is the manifestation of him selling out?
[1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:04.500]  Because he looks like somebody that saw the devil and made the deal of Faustian fear.
[1:49:04.500 --> 1:49:05.500]  He has his eyes.
[1:49:05.500 --> 1:49:06.500]  Great way to describe it.
[1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:07.500]  Faustian fear.
[1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:08.500]  Clearly.
[1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:09.500]  Exactly.
[1:49:09.500 --> 1:49:10.500]  So what the hell do you think he did?
[1:49:10.500 --> 1:49:14.500]  I mean, but intellectually, what is he doing that serves evil?
[1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:20.500]  Well, intellectually, what he's doing is he's attempting to push atomistic individualism
[1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:28.500]  in order to prevent people from taking pride in their families, in their identities, and in their nations.
[1:49:28.500 --> 1:49:36.500]  I mean, he's been richly rewarded to try to turn people away from nationalism.
[1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:37.500]  Sure.
[1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:40.500]  So it's kind of a form of Satanism and it's still all about you.
[1:49:40.500 --> 1:49:42.500]  And by doing that, you lose everything.
[1:49:42.500 --> 1:49:43.500]  Yes.
[1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:44.500]  Yeah.
[1:49:44.500 --> 1:49:48.500]  And I'm speaking as not only a former small libertarian, but I used to be considered.
[1:49:48.500 --> 1:49:53.500]  I was on the list of the 25 leading libertarians on the Internet.
[1:49:53.500 --> 1:49:58.500]  So, you know, it's a seductive argument and one that I fell for.
[1:49:58.500 --> 1:50:06.500]  But at the end of the day, libertarianism is as intrinsically false as communism.
[1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:10.500]  Well, yeah, because the big corporations, when you leave them alone, just become a new government.
[1:50:10.500 --> 1:50:11.500]  Listen, you got to come back next week.
[1:50:11.500 --> 1:50:12.500]  A year has been too long.
[1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:13.500]  Come back in the next few weeks.
[1:50:13.500 --> 1:50:16.500]  I want to do a whole hour on archaven.com.
[1:50:16.500 --> 1:50:17.500]  Amazing comics there.
[1:50:17.500 --> 1:50:19.500]  A lot of really great stuff.
[1:50:19.500 --> 1:50:20.500]  You're reaching a ton of people.
[1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:23.500]  Everybody should get a membership and give it to their young people.
[1:50:23.500 --> 1:50:26.500]  Certainly adults are in the comics will really enjoy it.
[1:50:26.500 --> 1:50:27.500]  That's archaven.com.
[1:50:27.500 --> 1:50:32.500]  Give us 30 seconds on archaven.com, Vox.
[1:50:32.500 --> 1:50:35.500]  Archaven.com is actually free for everyone to read.
[1:50:35.500 --> 1:50:39.500]  We do have subscriptions, but that's just to support the production of more art.
[1:50:39.500 --> 1:50:40.500]  But that's what I'm saying.
[1:50:40.500 --> 1:50:41.500]  Absolutely.
[1:50:41.500 --> 1:50:42.500]  Yeah.
[1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:43.500]  People should go there.
[1:50:43.500 --> 1:50:47.500]  It's pretty out there, as you can see.
[1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:51.500]  This is from Midnight's War, which is our vampire comic.
[1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:55.500]  We've got openly Christian comics.
[1:50:55.500 --> 1:50:57.500]  We've got military comics.
[1:50:57.500 --> 1:50:58.500]  We've got classic comics.
[1:50:58.500 --> 1:51:02.500]  The legend Chuck Dixon writes a number of them.
[1:51:02.500 --> 1:51:06.500]  We've got strong heroes.
[1:51:06.500 --> 1:51:08.500]  We've got beautiful women.
[1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:12.500]  We've got the best of what the Silver Age and the Golden Age offers.
[1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:17.500]  But most importantly, we have a very strict rule, even for the independent creators who
[1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:23.500]  join us, which is no sex, no Satanism, and no social justice.
[1:51:23.500 --> 1:51:31.500]  In that particular comic, one of the interesting things is that we actually answer the question
[1:51:31.500 --> 1:51:37.500]  that people have asked for centuries or for decades, which is why do vampires fear the
[1:51:37.500 --> 1:51:38.500]  cross?
[1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:47.500]  And so it's kind of a wild, totally new take on the whole vampire lore.
[1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:49.500]  And I think that people will like it.
[1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:52.500]  Hammer Freedom is from our partners in Brazil.
[1:51:52.500 --> 1:51:54.500]  It's absolutely brilliant.
[1:51:54.500 --> 1:51:56.500]  Well, I could have said I'm breakfast.
[1:51:56.500 --> 1:51:57.500]  I knew that.
[1:51:57.500 --> 1:52:00.500]  The site's free, but when I say a subscriber, you mean patrons.
[1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:01.500]  People are going to support it.
[1:52:01.500 --> 1:52:02.500]  They should go there.
[1:52:02.500 --> 1:52:03.500]  A lot of amazing stuff.
[1:52:03.500 --> 1:52:05.500]  Everybody share the link, archaven.com.
[1:52:05.500 --> 1:52:06.500]  Vox Day.

[1:52:11.500 --> 1:52:12.500]  Very thoughtful.
[1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:13.500]  You smart guy.
[1:52:13.500 --> 1:52:14.500]  Okay, we're going to go to break.
[1:52:14.500 --> 1:52:16.500]  Got a special guest coming in just briefly.

[1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:43.500]  Stay with us.
[1:52:43.500 --> 1:52:48.500]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where info wars is.
[1:52:48.500 --> 1:52:52.500]  And it's always a complex picture, but I do my best to explain it to you because you
[1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:55.500]  are the patrons that make all this possible.
[1:52:55.500 --> 1:53:00.660]  In short, the world's awakening to spiral the censorship info wars has never been more
[1:53:00.660 --> 1:53:05.500]  influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global agenda and fighting it.
[1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:11.140]  But that said, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because
[1:53:11.140 --> 1:53:15.180]  most of us selling products which you want to buy like DNA Force plus and others have
[1:53:15.180 --> 1:53:17.100]  been sold out for up to seven months.
[1:53:17.100 --> 1:53:18.100]  Well, guess what?
[1:53:18.100 --> 1:53:20.300]  DNA Force plus just came back in.
[1:53:20.300 --> 1:53:21.700]  Thank God for seven months.
[1:53:21.700 --> 1:53:22.700]  It's 40% off.
[1:53:22.700 --> 1:53:23.700]  It's amazing.
[1:53:23.700 --> 1:53:29.140]  And for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store wide free shipping and
[1:53:29.140 --> 1:53:34.020]  double patriot points and alpha powers back in stock and super mill vitality back in stock

[1:53:41.900 --> 1:53:45.220]  Thanks for keeping us on the air info warriors.
[1:53:45.220 --> 1:53:49.420]  You know, I'm cutting out right now and I've been here on the Saturday cutting days.
[1:53:49.420 --> 1:53:54.620]  I've done a terrible job because I've just cut like five ads and I didn't tell people
[1:53:54.620 --> 1:53:56.300]  the most important part.
[1:53:56.300 --> 1:54:02.140]  No, it's not that DNA Force plus has been sold out for seven months and is back in stock
[1:54:02.140 --> 1:54:06.380]  and is 40% off or how the supply chain broke down and how it almost bankrupted us.
[1:54:06.380 --> 1:54:10.860]  But thank God it finally came in or how it cleans up your mitochondria and makes your
[1:54:10.860 --> 1:54:13.580]  telomeres last longer and can regrow nerves.
[1:54:13.580 --> 1:54:15.380]  You've got to go research DNA Force plus.
[1:54:15.380 --> 1:54:19.380]  No, it's not that reason I just cut all those ads and forgot the most important part.
[1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:20.380]  That's the point.
[1:54:20.380 --> 1:54:25.340]  The super low vitality is back in stock percent off the prostitutes back 40% off that alpha
[1:54:25.340 --> 1:54:30.580]  power is back 50% off that ultra 12 vitamin B 12 take another tongue is incredible is

[1:54:34.780 --> 1:54:39.860]  No, it's that we've got double patriot points and free shipping store wide double patriot
[1:54:39.860 --> 1:54:48.380]  points free shipping store wide on top of the huge sales.
[1:54:48.380 --> 1:54:58.180]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:54:58.180 --> 1:54:59.180]  Welcome back my friends.
[1:54:59.180 --> 1:55:05.340]  Well, former head of the CIA and then head of the State Department, Mike Pompeo has come
[1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:07.940]  out and said, we didn't know what happened to that lab.
[1:55:07.940 --> 1:55:11.300]  Well, they know because Fauci paid for it all with Obama.
[1:55:11.300 --> 1:55:14.060]  They're bringing us out to menace the deep state.
[1:55:14.060 --> 1:55:16.660]  They're threatening to try to indict Trump.
[1:55:16.660 --> 1:55:20.580]  And so this is an internal battle in government with groups that know damn well what happened.
[1:55:20.580 --> 1:55:22.620]  And it's it's very sophisticated.
[1:55:22.620 --> 1:55:24.820]  They did it in China with US funding.
[1:55:24.820 --> 1:55:28.940]  So that they released it on the world for a power grab that you couldn't blame China.
[1:55:28.940 --> 1:55:32.980]  You couldn't blame the US is the globalist program of the UN.
[1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:33.980]  They're the ones that need to pay.
[1:55:33.980 --> 1:55:37.380]  But here's Pompeo beginning to bring this out there.
[1:55:37.380 --> 1:55:41.900]  You see Senator Paul lot stronger saying we need to basically indict Fauci for perjury
[1:55:41.900 --> 1:55:42.900]  before Congress.
[1:55:42.900 --> 1:55:46.340]  But this is quite a moment we've reached and we'll go to break and come back with
[1:55:46.340 --> 1:55:51.860]  huge news, big breaking news, a big break in the case on who's smuggling massive numbers
[1:55:51.860 --> 1:55:55.060]  of children over the Mexico border into the US.
[1:55:55.060 --> 1:56:00.420]  Mark's over a year ago now in early May of 2020, talking about this risk.
[1:56:00.420 --> 1:56:01.420]  And it was outrageous.
[1:56:01.420 --> 1:56:05.420]  It was outrageous to see scientists, even government US government scientists who were
[1:56:05.420 --> 1:56:09.980]  denying this when they surely must have seen the same information that I had seen that includes
[1:56:09.980 --> 1:56:12.540]  certainly Dr. Fauci as well.
[1:56:12.540 --> 1:56:14.380]  We need to know what happened here.
[1:56:14.380 --> 1:56:16.780]  The Chinese Communist Party knows what happened here.
[1:56:16.780 --> 1:56:18.060]  They know who Patience Zero was.
[1:56:18.060 --> 1:56:20.140]  They know precisely where this began.
[1:56:20.140 --> 1:56:23.700]  These three individuals who became sick, the symptoms were consistent with what someone
[1:56:23.700 --> 1:56:28.780]  would get that we be symptomatic of if they had COVID-19, the Wuhan virus.
[1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:30.900]  We need to get to the bottom of this because this could happen again.
[1:56:30.900 --> 1:56:35.020]  They're still conducting research in these same laboratories today that's being done
[1:56:35.020 --> 1:56:38.500]  in ways that were similar to what happened back over a year ago.
[1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:39.500]  This is dangerous.
[1:56:39.500 --> 1:56:43.420]  We could end up with something much, much like this again being foisted upon the world.
[1:56:43.420 --> 1:56:47.380]  The United States has a responsibility to demand that the Chinese Communist Party give
[1:56:47.380 --> 1:56:50.420]  us the things that they simply know, Dana and Bill.
[1:56:50.420 --> 1:56:53.420]  They know the answer to these things and they refuse to hand over this information.
[1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:54.740]  Well, the world may demand it.
[1:56:54.740 --> 1:56:57.980]  You and many others might along the way.
[1:56:57.980 --> 1:57:00.900]  But the party in Beijing acts differently.
[1:57:00.900 --> 1:57:04.940]  Who's to say will ever get a straight answer?
[1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:08.220]  Bill, I think we eventually will.
[1:57:08.220 --> 1:57:13.020]  Well, somebody will have worked in that laboratory and will decide they can sneak out of China.
[1:57:13.020 --> 1:57:14.020]  Don't come tell the truth.
[1:57:14.020 --> 1:57:15.020]  I'm convinced.
[1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:18.260]  But sadly, I don't think that will happen in a timely fashion.
[1:57:18.260 --> 1:57:19.260]  What can the world do?
[1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:20.700]  How can we hold China accountable?
[1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:23.580]  There are many forums that we could do this in.
[1:57:23.580 --> 1:57:27.460]  Why on earth would you re-join the World Health Organization, which rewards the Chinese
[1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:30.220]  for the exact partner that they joined in the cover-up with?
[1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:35.180]  It was Dr. Tedros and Xi Jinping that colluded to keep this information out of the hands
[1:57:35.180 --> 1:57:36.180]  of the world.
[1:57:36.180 --> 1:57:40.100]  There are many things the United States government could do to impose real costs on the Chinese
[1:57:40.100 --> 1:57:43.940]  Communist Party until they come clean about what they know and what they did.
[1:57:43.940 --> 1:57:46.620]  We know for sure they covered up this virus.
[1:57:46.620 --> 1:57:50.500]  I am confident that we will find that the evidence that we have seen today is consistent
[1:57:50.500 --> 1:57:51.500]  with a lab leak.
[1:57:51.500 --> 1:57:52.980]  And I'm convinced that's what we'll see.
[1:57:52.980 --> 1:57:56.500]  If I'm wrong, I hope the Chinese Communist Party will come forward and make a fool of
[1:57:56.500 --> 1:57:57.500]  it.
[1:57:57.500 --> 1:58:04.060]  If only we had, if this is the true, and this happened in November of 2019, if only the
[1:58:04.060 --> 1:58:05.740]  world would have known.
[1:58:05.740 --> 1:58:10.620]  Think about how much grief this planet would have been spared.
[1:58:10.620 --> 1:58:16.060]  Bill, I remember talking with Dr. Redfield about this at great length.
[1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:17.580]  We were working so hard.
[1:58:17.580 --> 1:58:21.620]  HHS, Secretary Azar, myself, we were working so hard to get this information.
[1:58:21.620 --> 1:58:26.140]  This would have been early January of 2020, when we were still trying to figure out precisely
[1:58:26.140 --> 1:58:27.660]  what was about to hit the world.
[1:58:27.660 --> 1:58:30.580]  And the Chinese Communist Party had gone completely dark.
[1:58:30.580 --> 1:58:31.660]  They wouldn't take our phone calls.
[1:58:31.660 --> 1:58:32.900]  They wouldn't answer our questions.
[1:58:32.900 --> 1:58:35.140]  We said inquiries.
[1:58:35.140 --> 1:58:36.420]  We couldn't get a straight answer.
[1:58:36.420 --> 1:58:39.980]  Our ambassador, Ambassador Branstad, couldn't get a straight answer.
[1:58:39.980 --> 1:58:41.980]  The Chinese Communist Party clearly knew they had a problem.
[1:58:41.980 --> 1:58:43.740]  They didn't want the world to know it.
[1:58:43.740 --> 1:58:46.980]  And I'm convinced they still know they have a problem and don't want us to know it.
[1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:51.540]  I mean, if true, it is the largest man-made disaster ever in the history of the planet.
[1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:52.980]  And someone has to be held accountable.
[1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:54.980]  That would be them, if this turns out to be true.
[1:58:54.980 --> 1:58:56.780]  Can I also ask you about this over the weekend?
[1:58:56.780 --> 1:59:04.300]  This is an absolutely brazen ruse done by Belarus to hijack a plane, Ryanair, going from
[1:59:04.300 --> 1:59:09.220]  Athens to Lithuania, to divert the plane, saying there was a bomb threat.
[1:59:09.220 --> 1:59:11.220]  Get on the ground for Russian...
[1:59:11.220 --> 1:59:12.220]  All right, folks.
[1:59:12.220 --> 1:59:13.220]  Staying all the way.
[1:59:13.220 --> 1:59:14.220]  I'm drinking, bros.
[1:59:14.220 --> 1:59:15.340]  He's going to be joining us.
[1:59:15.340 --> 1:59:17.860]  He's got major breaking news.
[1:59:17.860 --> 1:59:21.820]  We spent a lot of time down on the Texas border.
[1:59:21.820 --> 1:59:25.300]  We've had other guests gone from around the country.
[1:59:25.300 --> 1:59:30.060]  And we've got a lot of pieces of the puzzle, but he's gotten the final pieces about the
[1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:35.860]  illegal activity going on, and U.S. intelligence agency-connected contractors working under
[1:59:35.860 --> 1:59:40.220]  Biden committing these operations will be right back in 60 seconds on the other side.
[1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:45.100]  This is big important news to bring down the globalist operation, collapsing our borders,
[1:59:45.100 --> 1:59:47.460]  and to save these children and women and others.
[1:59:47.460 --> 1:59:48.460]  This is serious stuff.
[1:59:48.460 --> 1:59:49.460]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:50.460]  We'll be right back.
[1:59:50.460 --> 1:59:58.180]  We're launching our 2021 Memorial Week specials.

[2:00:34.340 --> 2:00:37.180]  and specials to mention them all here today.

[2:01:17.060 --> 2:01:23.100]  All right, I've spent a couple weeks in Texas border with Mexico this year.
[2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:27.020]  So has Owen Shroyer and the rest of my crew, all total, we spent about a month and a half
[2:01:27.020 --> 2:01:28.020]  down there.
[2:01:28.020 --> 2:01:31.140]  We've had Project Veritas Tom that's broken a lot of big pieces of this.
[2:01:31.140 --> 2:01:38.580]  But this is the biggest piece so far completing the picture of what's happening.
[2:01:38.580 --> 2:01:39.580]  Dan Holloway is here.
[2:01:39.580 --> 2:01:43.060]  He grew up in South Carolina, graduated high school and college before, listed in the U.S.
[2:01:43.060 --> 2:01:44.060]  Army 2005.
[2:01:44.060 --> 2:01:47.500]  Dan holds multiple degrees in technology security, including a master's in international
[2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:49.500]  homeland security from Penn State University.
[2:01:49.500 --> 2:01:54.380]  Dan has deeply involved in military and veteran advocacy, has previously spent years at Black
[2:01:54.380 --> 2:01:59.740]  Rifle Coffee Company's VP of marketing in five years as an infantry sergeant in the
[2:01:59.740 --> 2:02:02.060]  U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division.
[2:02:02.060 --> 2:02:08.020]  Dan now serves as owner of Tetherball Academy Media and is the host of Drinking Bros. Podcast
[2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:11.020]  and American Party Podcast DrinkingBros.com.
[2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:15.900]  And they have a lot of fun on the show, I've been on it, American Party Podcast also on
[2:02:15.900 --> 2:02:16.900]  Twitter.
[2:02:16.900 --> 2:02:19.340]  But they also cover a lot of serious news.
[2:02:19.340 --> 2:02:25.220]  And wow, what you guys brought out a week ago spurred some major announcements in Congress
[2:02:25.220 --> 2:02:28.420]  also in legislatures about the human smuggling.
[2:02:28.420 --> 2:02:34.620]  We have a Senate report from six years ago where they confirmed Obama knowingly placed
[2:02:34.620 --> 2:02:39.660]  tens of thousands of children with smugglers, including sex smugglers that were put into
[2:02:39.660 --> 2:02:40.660]  sex slavery.
[2:02:40.660 --> 2:02:41.820]  It was on screen watching both.
[2:02:41.820 --> 2:02:46.580]  So this is a continuation of that program, but much, much bigger.
[2:02:46.580 --> 2:02:51.540]  We did five, six times what the Border Patrol tells us the previous level, not three times
[2:02:51.540 --> 2:02:53.420]  like you've seen on Fox News.
[2:02:53.420 --> 2:02:57.940]  We've been down there, it's just illegals everywhere being loaded onto planes, private
[2:02:57.940 --> 2:03:02.500]  corporate planes taken through airports, not checked by TSA.
[2:03:02.500 --> 2:03:05.220]  They use the military and Border Patrol to put them on the planes.
[2:03:05.220 --> 2:03:08.140]  The Border Patrol just hands them over to the smugglers, they disappear.
[2:03:08.140 --> 2:03:13.340]  But there are masked men that use COVID as a cover that actually then travel into the
[2:03:13.340 --> 2:03:14.340]  interior.
[2:03:14.340 --> 2:03:16.820]  And that's why Dan Holloway is here from his sources.
[2:03:16.820 --> 2:03:22.780]  He's got the documents, the photos, the videos, the intel to bring it all together, proving
[2:03:22.780 --> 2:03:23.860]  who is behind it.
[2:03:23.860 --> 2:03:24.860]  So Dan, great to have you here.
[2:03:24.860 --> 2:03:25.860]  Yeah, it's great to be here.
[2:03:25.860 --> 2:03:28.380]  I mean, this is a really bad situation for everybody involved.
[2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:34.060]  I mean, not only is our national sovereignty being challenged, but now it's helpless people,
[2:03:34.060 --> 2:03:38.940]  and primarily that are being put in harms away by this, that's why, you know, this stuff
[2:03:38.940 --> 2:03:39.940]  has to get out.
[2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:43.780]  So a couple of months ago, my friend James Kluge, he's an independent reporter, he works
[2:03:43.780 --> 2:03:49.620]  with a couple of other agencies now, but we started seeing these mental envelopes with
[2:03:49.620 --> 2:03:54.020]  a white piece of paper stapled to it, and it says, I don't speak English, please help
[2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:55.020]  me.
[2:03:55.020 --> 2:03:57.380]  On the other side, it has travel plans, right, their flights.
[2:03:57.380 --> 2:04:02.500]  You see these people in airports all the time, they're illegal immigrants that have not received
[2:04:02.500 --> 2:04:07.220]  a den of phase or an NTA notice to appear, they don't even get a court date anymore.
[2:04:07.220 --> 2:04:11.540]  So typically those illegal immigrants that have been caught cross is part of the Obama's
[2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:16.420]  capture release program for back in the days, as you might remember.
[2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:22.020]  Now they're not even being given court dates, so here's what we saw.
[2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:26.020]  This is actually, I didn't even receive the first piece of intel, I saw it myself at DFW
[2:04:26.020 --> 2:04:27.020]  airport.
[2:04:27.020 --> 2:04:29.500]  Like these pictures that you're going to see, I took these myself.
[2:04:29.500 --> 2:04:34.420]  So under the guise of quote-unquote re-anining these people with family members, they're
[2:04:34.420 --> 2:04:40.780]  trafficking unaccompanied children all over the United States, dropping them off in random
[2:04:40.780 --> 2:04:41.780]  places.
[2:04:41.780 --> 2:04:46.100]  Now we did a story on this last Wednesday, by Friday, the Tennessee legislature was like,
[2:04:46.100 --> 2:04:50.300]  hey, why are you bringing people into our state in the dead of night and not reporting
[2:04:50.300 --> 2:04:52.340]  on where they're going, right?
[2:04:52.340 --> 2:04:54.420]  So a lot of stuff going on there.
[2:04:54.420 --> 2:04:57.260]  By the way, for radio listeners, let's go through these slowly.
[2:04:57.260 --> 2:05:01.580]  That seller is obviously military, he does not look too friendly towards you.
[2:05:01.580 --> 2:05:05.460]  Oh no, I mean, I got right up in his face and took a picture, so he probably wasn't
[2:05:05.460 --> 2:05:06.460]  too thrilled about that.
[2:05:06.460 --> 2:05:09.020]  And he knows what he's doing is wrong as well.
[2:05:09.020 --> 2:05:14.300]  So after this, I spoke to a lot of people from CBP, this seems to be largely out of
[2:05:14.300 --> 2:05:15.300]  their control.
[2:05:15.300 --> 2:05:19.300]  They're being forced to hand these people over and not issue NTAs by edict right now.
[2:05:19.300 --> 2:05:26.260]  The other part of that is that it began, this is directly from my source at CBP, who works
[2:05:26.260 --> 2:05:28.140]  on the border.
[2:05:28.140 --> 2:05:32.500]  It started out as these kids were being reunited with their immediate family, then they couldn't
[2:05:32.500 --> 2:05:33.740]  find their immediate families.
[2:05:33.740 --> 2:05:37.940]  So it became any family member, and then it became anybody who would receive them.
[2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:44.100]  Now if you want to look at this Axios report from the middle of this month, the Biden administration
[2:05:44.100 --> 2:05:48.460]  mom on trafficking migrant kids, that's the name of the report.
[2:05:48.460 --> 2:05:52.260]  Apparently we have no way of tracking where any of these children are going, 122,000 since
[2:05:52.260 --> 2:05:57.180]  January have entered the country, unaccompanied, and they've been sent to quote-unquote care
[2:05:57.180 --> 2:06:04.140]  facilities and to people that aren't actually even their family members.
[2:06:04.140 --> 2:06:08.100]  Illegal immigration is a big enough problem, but when children are involved and they're
[2:06:08.100 --> 2:06:13.580]  being victimized because of this process, that's where I step in.
[2:06:13.580 --> 2:06:15.460]  We cannot tolerate that as a society.
[2:06:15.460 --> 2:06:20.260]  Anytime any child is taken advantage of in any kind of way, that has to stop regardless
[2:06:20.260 --> 2:06:22.020]  of any kind of political beliefs.
[2:06:22.020 --> 2:06:25.900]  That is a line you cannot cross, and it's one that the Biden administration clearly
[2:06:25.900 --> 2:06:28.740]  is fine crossing, and I don't understand why.
[2:06:28.740 --> 2:06:31.580]  Let me just stop here, this is just a microcosm.
[2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:36.620]  We have this woman on no less than over 15 videos at bus terminals, at airports, and
[2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:42.540]  at private airfields saying, I am this child's mother, lying to then hand it off to another
[2:06:42.540 --> 2:06:46.140]  person that they doesn't know to put them on an airplane and they admit they don't know
[2:06:46.140 --> 2:06:47.620]  even where they're going.
[2:06:47.620 --> 2:06:57.060]  So this is literal illegal smuggling of children, she has MS-13 and other tattoos on her.
[2:06:57.060 --> 2:07:02.020]  This is federal crime, felonies on video, but you've now learned directly that it's
[2:07:02.020 --> 2:07:04.180]  Biden using military contractors.
[2:07:04.180 --> 2:07:05.180]  Please continue.
[2:07:05.180 --> 2:07:11.700]  Right, so during the Obama administration, I'm actually reading from my source at CBP.
[2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:19.180]  During the Obama administration, they found a ton of altered OTM birth certificates, and
[2:07:19.180 --> 2:07:20.820]  they had QR codes on them.
[2:07:20.820 --> 2:07:25.700]  There was a huge investigation that happened that was never made public, where people in
[2:07:25.700 --> 2:07:29.420]  their home country, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Mexico, et cetera, were forging birth certificates
[2:07:29.420 --> 2:07:30.700]  to get people into our country.
[2:07:30.700 --> 2:07:35.660]  They were making it look like these kids and certain family members that were adults were
[2:07:35.660 --> 2:07:38.860]  related to people here in the states, and they were trying to reunite them with them.
[2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:45.660]  It turns out when they started running, when the CBP started running these files, they noticed
[2:07:45.660 --> 2:07:49.340]  that the people in the picture did not look like the people they were staring at in front
[2:07:49.340 --> 2:07:53.140]  of their own faces.
[2:07:53.140 --> 2:07:54.140]  It's the kids.
[2:07:54.140 --> 2:07:55.140]  Falsified smuggling.
[2:07:55.140 --> 2:08:00.980]  Right, so again, it all comes back to me, all this is horrible as it stands.
[2:08:00.980 --> 2:08:04.380]  Now children are involved.
[2:08:04.380 --> 2:08:07.900]  It doesn't matter what your plan is politically, it doesn't matter what your politics are left
[2:08:07.900 --> 2:08:08.900]  to right.
[2:08:08.900 --> 2:08:09.900]  You can't let this happen.
[2:08:09.900 --> 2:08:10.900]  You cannot let this happen.
[2:08:10.900 --> 2:08:14.780]  This cannot be allowed to happen, and if you're okay with allowing children to be victimized
[2:08:14.780 --> 2:08:18.100]  by this, then we need to have a different kind of conversation.
[2:08:18.100 --> 2:08:23.500]  We can have a civil conversation if it's about how we deal with countries nearby, and how
[2:08:23.500 --> 2:08:25.660]  we help those people in a human care way.
[2:08:25.660 --> 2:08:29.420]  If you're involved in premeditated organized crime, we have video of men coming and saying,
[2:08:29.420 --> 2:08:35.460]  I only want women with unaccompanied children, and picking them out like some movie about
[2:08:35.460 --> 2:08:39.260]  Romans picking slaves or something, I mean, it's like throwing a grocery store getting
[2:08:39.260 --> 2:08:40.260]  potatoes or something.
[2:08:40.260 --> 2:08:45.860]  Right, yeah, I mean, it's, what do we know about human trafficking?
[2:08:45.860 --> 2:08:50.300]  It attracts the worst human beings on earth.
[2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:54.640]  Look at the, even the American foster care system is rife with abuse.
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:57.680]  We know that, right, and it's a horrible situation.
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:08:59.020]  We're making it worse.
[2:08:59.020 --> 2:09:03.900]  We're putting these kids into situations because, well, not we, the left of these countries
[2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:08.300]  putting kids in these horrible situations because of what they feel politically without
[2:09:08.300 --> 2:09:10.620]  any regard for the safety of the child.
[2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:16.140]  And now we know these people aren't mulling over heroin or fentanyl or cocaine or marijuana.
[2:09:16.140 --> 2:09:21.060]  They throw the children over, let them bounce after a 10-foot, 20-foot fall, and then they
[2:09:21.060 --> 2:09:24.980]  have a fake ID with them, and then it's just handed over to an aid group and delivered
[2:09:24.980 --> 2:09:26.420]  on down the pipeline.
[2:09:26.420 --> 2:09:27.420]  Right, yeah.
[2:09:27.420 --> 2:09:31.820]  And it used to be, again, under the Obama administration, who, by the way, deported more
[2:09:31.820 --> 2:09:36.860]  people than all previous presidents combined, they still had the counter-release program,
[2:09:36.860 --> 2:09:41.540]  which is where, if you qualified, if you had a relative in the United States somewhere
[2:09:41.540 --> 2:09:45.540]  and you weren't a violent felon, they just let you go into America and gave you a court
[2:09:45.540 --> 2:09:47.540]  date wherever you wanted to go.
[2:09:47.540 --> 2:09:49.300]  Now, they're not even just letting you go.
[2:09:49.300 --> 2:09:50.300]  They're paying for it.
[2:09:50.300 --> 2:09:51.300]  And they're trafficking people.
[2:09:51.300 --> 2:09:53.980]  Well, what you're saying is that Major Rubicon has been passed.
[2:09:53.980 --> 2:09:57.700]  And if Congress and the Legislature said, we let this happen, we, that's why you're
[2:09:57.700 --> 2:10:01.060]  here doing this, it's dangerous for everybody to do, because I don't want to get on the
[2:10:01.060 --> 2:10:02.060]  border and do this.
[2:10:02.060 --> 2:10:04.140]  But if I don't, I'm now aiding and abetting.
[2:10:04.140 --> 2:10:05.140]  Let's not lie about this.
[2:10:05.140 --> 2:10:07.140]  If we don't stop this, we're part of it.
[2:10:07.140 --> 2:10:08.140]  Right.
[2:10:08.140 --> 2:10:11.660]  And if you're, I mean, look, there's some other information that is relevant here.
[2:10:11.660 --> 2:10:18.660]  So, CBP officers do frequently travel, or ERO officers do frequently travel from ICE with
[2:10:18.660 --> 2:10:21.980]  these people to take them to court dates or to drop them off somewhere.
[2:10:21.980 --> 2:10:23.620]  So it's not all contractors.
[2:10:23.620 --> 2:10:25.100]  This is the part where...
[2:10:25.100 --> 2:10:27.740]  I'll stay there, because I'm going to drag you to the floor and come back, because I'm
[2:10:27.740 --> 2:10:28.740]  jumping in with your things.
[2:10:28.740 --> 2:10:30.340]  So, Dad, I'm just backing you up here.
[2:10:30.340 --> 2:10:33.100]  We've got all the video for TV viewers, everything you're saying.
[2:10:33.100 --> 2:10:38.860]  But you've discovered the private contractor group that's heavily involved and the next
[2:10:38.860 --> 2:10:41.420]  level of crime that just makes it that much more intense.
[2:10:41.420 --> 2:10:42.420]  Right.
[2:10:42.420 --> 2:10:45.420]  And so this is Intel, the Congress, the Legislatures, law enforcement, everybody.
[2:10:45.420 --> 2:10:47.540]  And of course, if we know this, they all know it as well.
[2:10:47.540 --> 2:10:49.140]  We'll be right back with Dan.
[2:10:49.140 --> 2:10:52.300]  Stay with us.
[2:10:52.300 --> 2:10:56.620]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.

[2:12:55.420 --> 2:13:12.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:12.420 --> 2:13:20.980]  All right, Dan Holloway is our guest, and he is a talk show host, and of course, a business
[2:13:20.980 --> 2:13:25.140]  man and veteran, who has a lot of great contacts and a lot of great research, and he's gotten
[2:13:25.140 --> 2:13:28.380]  some other big pieces of the puzzle about the private contractor groups who are doing
[2:13:28.380 --> 2:13:33.740]  this, officially for Biden, the laws that are being ignored, and more.
[2:13:33.740 --> 2:13:36.500]  I've known you a while, but on your show a few times, only a few years, you actually
[2:13:36.500 --> 2:13:37.500]  seem wound up and angry.
[2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:41.180]  You're usually a pretty calm guy, but this has got you pissed, so you've got the floor
[2:13:41.180 --> 2:13:45.980]  here, we'll put some of the documents, photos on screen, job postings, lay it out for us.
[2:13:45.980 --> 2:13:54.260]  All right, I mean, look, just to explain the anger, if kids are involved, then all bets
[2:13:54.260 --> 2:13:55.260]  are off.
[2:13:55.260 --> 2:13:56.260]  There's no more civility left.
[2:13:56.260 --> 2:14:00.220]  I don't care who the kids are, where they're from, what they look like, what color they
[2:14:00.220 --> 2:14:02.940]  are, what nationality they are, what religion they are, if they have one.
[2:14:02.940 --> 2:14:06.380]  I don't care about any of that shit, sorry, stuff.
[2:14:06.380 --> 2:14:07.740]  You cannot mess with children.
[2:14:07.740 --> 2:14:12.420]  So you know how the federal government works, Alex?
[2:14:12.420 --> 2:14:13.420]  We use cutouts.
[2:14:13.420 --> 2:14:18.460]  The CIA doesn't just give money to warlords, they give money to some business man who gives
[2:14:18.460 --> 2:14:19.820]  money to a warlord, right?
[2:14:19.820 --> 2:14:23.620]  It's one degree separation, it's plausible, deniability, whatever you want to call it.
[2:14:23.620 --> 2:14:27.740]  Just like the U.S. government under Obama gave all sorts of money to Qatar, the funds
[2:14:27.740 --> 2:14:31.940]  to Hamas, so they could run their government there after Hamas won elections back in the
[2:14:31.940 --> 2:14:35.100]  day in Palestine.
[2:14:35.100 --> 2:14:40.380]  Now the government is using to exercise this completely illegal nonsense that is victimizing
[2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:41.380]  children.
[2:14:41.380 --> 2:14:42.940]  They're running it through a company called NBM.
[2:14:42.940 --> 2:14:47.100]  So when I first took those pictures, I put them on the Internet and several different
[2:14:47.100 --> 2:14:51.100]  sources from inside the government sent me, they didn't tell me anything, they just sent
[2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:56.540]  me job postings from a company called NBM Incorporated.
[2:14:56.540 --> 2:15:01.540]  Now this is some of their, you can see how much money they've made from the federal government
[2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:08.620]  here, $342 million just over the last couple of years, unaccompanied alien children transportation
[2:15:08.620 --> 2:15:10.060]  services.
[2:15:10.060 --> 2:15:12.700]  So not only is the system internally corrupt.
[2:15:12.700 --> 2:15:14.620]  They're not being placed with family members anymore.
[2:15:14.620 --> 2:15:18.860]  They're being put in mass care facilities as they call it, who knows what that means
[2:15:18.860 --> 2:15:23.020]  because the Biden administration will not answer questions about any of this stuff.
[2:15:23.020 --> 2:15:27.140]  They're also being put with people, anybody, quote unquote, anybody who will take them,
[2:15:27.140 --> 2:15:29.660]  that's what I was told, anybody who will take them.
[2:15:29.660 --> 2:15:32.460]  Now again, I don't understand why they're bringing the children in here, maybe so they
[2:15:32.460 --> 2:15:36.180]  have residency to try to get their parents in later.
[2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:37.180]  I can only imagine.
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:42.300]  Let me add one thing, remember the FBI was ordered by Biden to not do background checks
[2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:43.900]  on who the children are being given to.
[2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:44.900]  So this is premeditated.
[2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:45.900]  Wow.
[2:15:45.900 --> 2:15:46.900]  Yeah.
[2:15:46.900 --> 2:15:47.900]  Yeah.
[2:15:47.900 --> 2:15:48.900]  Exactly.
[2:15:48.900 --> 2:15:54.540]  So this company NBM posted job openings for bilingual travel youth care workers since
[2:15:54.540 --> 2:15:57.380]  at least 2018.
[2:15:57.380 --> 2:16:00.940]  So it's been going on for a while now and it's been going on under our noses.
[2:16:00.940 --> 2:16:05.660]  The job opening described as a two to 12 month deployment project based escorting children
[2:16:05.660 --> 2:16:10.780]  and teenagers from McAllen, El Paso, San Antonio, San Diego and several other places to shelters
[2:16:10.780 --> 2:16:14.740]  all over the country or in efforts to reunite them with family members.
[2:16:14.740 --> 2:16:19.180]  You notice what it doesn't say is a passport is required because they're not leaving the
[2:16:19.180 --> 2:16:20.180]  country.
[2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:23.780]  They're putting them as far into the internal parts of our country as they can get them
[2:16:23.780 --> 2:16:24.780]  to hide them.
[2:16:24.780 --> 2:16:27.100]  And now they're not answering questions about it.
[2:16:27.100 --> 2:16:31.180]  Now there's a good, there's an old saying and it goes something to the effect of how
[2:16:31.180 --> 2:16:35.500]  do you know who's the real power, it's whoever you can't criticize, whoever you can't ask
[2:16:35.500 --> 2:16:38.140]  questions of.
[2:16:38.140 --> 2:16:42.300]  And now we're finding out who the real power in this country is.
[2:16:42.300 --> 2:16:45.540]  Now this company NBMs also had a lot of other problems.
[2:16:45.540 --> 2:16:51.780]  An investigation in July 2017 found that NBM was using unlicensed shelters including vacant
[2:16:51.780 --> 2:16:56.340]  office buildings to house these unaccompanied minors against, completely against the law.
[2:16:56.340 --> 2:17:00.620]  I mean this is good old fashioned like CIA finders case where they caught a van full
[2:17:00.620 --> 2:17:01.620]  of little kids.
[2:17:01.620 --> 2:17:03.300]  I mean this is just over the top.
[2:17:03.300 --> 2:17:10.780]  Yeah it's, the truly bizarre thing about it to me is how brazenly they're operating.
[2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:12.740]  These people are doing this in public.
[2:17:12.740 --> 2:17:17.100]  Now I think they believe they'll blend in with all the other ERO officers that have in the
[2:17:17.100 --> 2:17:20.100]  past been responsible for transporting these people.
[2:17:20.100 --> 2:17:26.660]  But man that's a hell of an expectation to just be able to traffic children in public.
[2:17:26.660 --> 2:17:27.660]  Exactly.
[2:17:27.660 --> 2:17:31.540]  And guys for TV viewers keep running through his photos at DFW in Dallas, Fort Worth, International
[2:17:31.540 --> 2:17:32.980]  Airport a few weeks ago.
[2:17:32.980 --> 2:17:35.700]  People can see point blank range what's happening.
[2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:38.340]  And you were able to confirm by the way from your sources we're not going to give his name
[2:17:38.340 --> 2:17:40.940]  out but this man does work for that company at that time.
[2:17:40.940 --> 2:17:41.940]  Yeah yeah.
[2:17:41.940 --> 2:17:44.460]  And it's an unfortunate situation.
[2:17:44.460 --> 2:17:49.100]  I mean while in the custody of NBM children have been held in unlicensed facilities forced
[2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:50.100]  to bathe in sinks.
[2:17:50.100 --> 2:17:53.980]  I mean it's all the worst stuff that we've seen at the border but now it's children
[2:17:53.980 --> 2:17:56.980]  alone without any supervision and without any government accountability.
[2:17:56.980 --> 2:18:00.460]  And you're already pissed but I don't know you've seen, you mentioned some of our footage
[2:18:00.460 --> 2:18:01.820]  so that's why we have it up.
[2:18:01.820 --> 2:18:04.900]  Did you see the parts where the guys come out and admit I'm just here for women and
[2:18:04.900 --> 2:18:05.900]  children.
[2:18:05.900 --> 2:18:09.740]  I take them back and teach them the way of God and it's like super creepy dudes.
[2:18:09.740 --> 2:18:12.980]  And then there's no record and he just gets children.
[2:18:12.980 --> 2:18:19.740]  Yeah I mean it's difficult in the United States to adopt a child and it should be.
[2:18:19.740 --> 2:18:20.740]  Right.
[2:18:20.740 --> 2:18:21.740]  I appreciate it.
[2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:23.500]  It took my parents two years to adopt my sister from Korea.
[2:18:23.500 --> 2:18:25.900]  I appreciate the fact that people are willing to do that.
[2:18:25.900 --> 2:18:27.060]  I think that's a great thing to do.
[2:18:27.060 --> 2:18:30.020]  There's a lot of kids out there that need help.
[2:18:30.020 --> 2:18:31.860]  They're not putting any effort into vetting.
[2:18:31.860 --> 2:18:35.700]  Like you said, it's actually against policy to run a background check on these people.
[2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:40.260]  So we're putting children from another country in the hands of people who are presumably
[2:18:40.260 --> 2:18:41.260]  also here illegally.
[2:18:41.260 --> 2:18:43.140]  Who else would they be giving them to?
[2:18:43.140 --> 2:18:48.500]  If you're reuniting people with their families, what family members do illegal immigrant children
[2:18:48.500 --> 2:18:49.500]  have in the United States?
[2:18:49.500 --> 2:18:50.500]  Look at this guy.
[2:18:50.500 --> 2:18:51.500]  Oh boy.
[2:18:51.500 --> 2:18:59.260]  Our security guys said it was all they could do to not physically, they were just repulsed.
[2:18:59.260 --> 2:19:02.380]  If somebody looks like a creep, typically they are one.
[2:19:02.380 --> 2:19:03.380]  Right.
[2:19:03.380 --> 2:19:07.220]  I mean how often do you see some pedophile get arrested and he's a normal looking person?
[2:19:07.220 --> 2:19:08.220]  Very, very rare.
[2:19:08.220 --> 2:19:09.620]  I'm not calling a guy a pedophile.
[2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:13.500]  He's just there from Pennsylvania and he says he wants kids and women, take them back, live
[2:19:13.500 --> 2:19:14.500]  in a trailer.
[2:19:14.500 --> 2:19:16.620]  He says he gets them all the time and he says which ones he wants.
[2:19:16.620 --> 2:19:20.860]  I'm just saying he looks like who I would cast in a movie as the creepiest person ever.
[2:19:20.860 --> 2:19:21.860]  Yeah.
[2:19:21.860 --> 2:19:24.900]  This dude looks like he's peeling people's skins off and wearing it.
[2:19:24.900 --> 2:19:25.900]  Who is this guy?
[2:19:25.900 --> 2:19:26.900]  What's his deal?
[2:19:26.900 --> 2:19:27.900]  Like what is he?
[2:19:27.900 --> 2:19:31.980]  He's your cop and you pull him over speeding in a van and there's a bunch of little kids
[2:19:31.980 --> 2:19:32.980]  in the back.
[2:19:32.980 --> 2:19:33.980]  What do you do?
[2:19:33.980 --> 2:19:34.980]  They're not his kids.
[2:19:34.980 --> 2:19:36.180]  I mean come on.
[2:19:36.180 --> 2:19:39.740]  So there's no evidence to support the claims that any of these children were forcibly separated
[2:19:39.740 --> 2:19:40.740]  from their families.
[2:19:40.740 --> 2:19:43.260]  I forgot to mention that earlier.
[2:19:43.260 --> 2:19:49.300]  This is the claim that was made by the administration is that they were forcibly separated from
[2:19:49.300 --> 2:19:51.260]  their parents and now we have to reunite them with somebody.
[2:19:51.260 --> 2:19:55.660]  They created this entire narrative and none of it is true.
[2:19:55.660 --> 2:19:56.980]  So I'm not sure what the next steps are.
[2:19:56.980 --> 2:19:58.980]  I'll tell you what I would like to see people doing.
[2:19:58.980 --> 2:20:03.380]  What I would like to see you doing, those of you who travel on airports particularly,
[2:20:03.380 --> 2:20:07.580]  can you bring up that picture again that has the middle envelope in it?
[2:20:07.580 --> 2:20:10.900]  If you see one of these, I want you to take a picture of the person carrying it.
[2:20:10.900 --> 2:20:15.780]  By the way, when we aired this, family, everybody tells me they see these at Austin, Merckstrom,
[2:20:15.780 --> 2:20:18.180]  DFW, Chicago, there's everywhere.
[2:20:18.180 --> 2:20:21.860]  So if you see somebody walking around with one of these, please take a picture of it.
[2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:25.500]  Try to get a picture of the other side because the other side has their flight plans on it.
[2:20:25.500 --> 2:20:28.940]  It has the flight number and the date and all that stuff on it.
[2:20:28.940 --> 2:20:29.940]  And then take a picture.
[2:20:29.940 --> 2:20:32.700]  If there's somebody escorting them, take a picture of that.
[2:20:32.700 --> 2:20:36.260]  What they're saying is that these children are being escorted.
[2:20:36.260 --> 2:20:41.500]  This picture right here, if you go to some of the other pictures I took, it wasn't just
[2:20:41.500 --> 2:20:43.220]  this man and a couple of unaccompanied children.
[2:20:43.220 --> 2:20:47.980]  It was an older woman probably in her 50s or 60s, a younger woman probably in her 30s,
[2:20:47.980 --> 2:20:52.860]  a man that was in his late 20s, probably wearing a hat that said, U.S. Navy on it.
[2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:53.860]  Right?
[2:20:53.860 --> 2:20:55.900]  So this is the woman and the child.
[2:20:55.900 --> 2:21:01.780]  There were two additional children and there was an older woman next to them and a man
[2:21:01.780 --> 2:21:03.540]  that was wearing a Navy hat.
[2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:06.980]  It was like, you know, in bad spy movies when somebody's trying to blend in and they buy
[2:21:06.980 --> 2:21:09.780]  a New York Yankees hat to pretend they're from New York?
[2:21:09.780 --> 2:21:10.780]  I mean, it's...
[2:21:10.780 --> 2:21:12.780]  You guys, find the one with the Navy hat.
[2:21:12.780 --> 2:21:13.780]  Oh, I don't know if I have...
[2:21:13.780 --> 2:21:17.820]  I don't know if I got that one up there, but it's absolute nonsense and they just think
[2:21:17.820 --> 2:21:20.300]  they can get away with it, right?
[2:21:20.300 --> 2:21:21.580]  Because that's where we are right now.
[2:21:21.580 --> 2:21:27.300]  They know that they have the media, which has become just a complete propaganda wing
[2:21:27.300 --> 2:21:28.300]  for the United States.
[2:21:28.300 --> 2:21:30.100]  There it is, FBI waves, background checks.
[2:21:30.100 --> 2:21:33.340]  We learned it's not just for the housing centers, it's for whoever they're handing them to.
[2:21:33.340 --> 2:21:34.340]  It's unbelievable.
[2:21:34.340 --> 2:21:35.340]  All right, stay right there, Dan.
[2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:39.380]  We're going to come back on the other side and lay out where this needs to go, what all
[2:21:39.380 --> 2:21:42.060]  of us can do, including you, to stop this.
[2:21:42.060 --> 2:21:48.060]  And once we archive this report at band.video or freeworldnews.tv, share it.
[2:21:48.060 --> 2:21:51.460]  We'll be right back.
[2:21:51.460 --> 2:21:57.340]  I'm giving you a status report on what your support of InfoWars has done.
[2:21:57.340 --> 2:22:01.460]  We are kicking globalist ass up and down the planet right now.
[2:22:01.460 --> 2:22:06.020]  Their entire agenda of depopulation, poison vaccines, it's all coming out.
[2:22:06.020 --> 2:22:09.420]  And yes, I'm risking my life and yes, this is very dangerous, but it's worth it.

[2:22:51.340 --> 2:22:55.620]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast, and then
[2:22:55.620 --> 2:22:58.420]  I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[2:22:58.420 --> 2:23:02.420]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed and how
[2:23:02.420 --> 2:23:06.620]  they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are
[2:23:06.620 --> 2:23:07.620]  in.
[2:23:07.620 --> 2:23:10.580]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden
[2:23:10.580 --> 2:23:13.820]  and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try to make people wear masks.
[2:23:13.820 --> 2:23:18.620]  I could tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super
[2:23:18.620 --> 2:23:20.820]  good news concerning the InfoWars?
[2:23:20.820 --> 2:23:24.900]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day Special
[2:23:24.900 --> 2:23:32.020]  for the next week only with store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, and DNA Force
[2:23:32.020 --> 2:23:39.020]  Plus is back in stock, sold out for seven months, 40% off, SuperMobileTallity, 50% off,

[2:23:45.820 --> 2:23:51.300]  Points, and InfoWars, and it's incredible products, and George Soros hates it.
[2:23:51.300 --> 2:23:54.420]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our best-selling products have been sold
[2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:58.420]  out for three months, four months, six months, seven months, it's not a gimmick to make
[2:23:58.420 --> 2:23:59.420]  you buy the products.
[2:23:59.420 --> 2:24:04.180]  I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements
[2:24:04.180 --> 2:24:07.940]  and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation because they're great products
[2:24:07.940 --> 2:24:10.780]  that we're coming back and getting more, and thank you for the support.
[2:24:10.780 --> 2:24:15.820]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus, or whether it's PolymBlock, or whether it's SuperMobileTallity
[2:24:15.820 --> 2:24:21.420]  or FazObeats, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower
[2:24:21.420 --> 2:24:24.700]  the quality of our products, and so we just can't offer them.
[2:24:24.700 --> 2:24:29.780]  But thank God, it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now because suddenly
[2:24:29.780 --> 2:24:32.940]  a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock, and one
[2:24:32.940 --> 2:24:38.100]  of them is PolymBlock. It takes a long time to get into PolymBlock, but it's for seasonal
[2:24:38.100 --> 2:24:43.740]  discomfort, stuff like allergies. It's from France. It's a special proprietary system.
[2:24:43.740 --> 2:24:48.500]  This is the highest quality, back in stock, infowarstore.com. Store-wide free shipping
[2:24:48.500 --> 2:24:54.340]  and double-patriot points. Check it out.
[2:24:54.340 --> 2:25:11.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:25:11.420 --> 2:25:16.300]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time. We're here live
[2:25:16.300 --> 2:25:20.740]  on air. Weekday mornings, Eric Smith, 8 a.m. with American Journal, and of course Owen
[2:25:20.740 --> 2:25:26.420]  Shroyer, the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m. Central. I come back Sundays, 4 to 6. Now we have Sunday
[2:25:26.420 --> 2:25:28.100]  live as well.
[2:25:28.100 --> 2:25:34.540]  All right. Dan Holloway is our guest here in studio, and of course he's been the vice
[2:25:34.540 --> 2:25:38.860]  president over there at Black Rifle Coffee Company for a while. Did a great job. It's
[2:25:38.860 --> 2:25:42.980]  a very popular company, great coffee. And of course he hosts several big popular podcasts,
[2:25:42.980 --> 2:25:47.900]  Drinking Bros.com, American Party Podcast, Drinking Bros. Podcast. You can find those
[2:25:47.900 --> 2:25:52.780]  on Twitter, and they're brave, too. They've had me on their show. They don't care about
[2:25:52.780 --> 2:25:56.980]  all the censorship, and they're right down the street. It's funny how awesome has become
[2:25:56.980 --> 2:26:02.620]  this big magnet of podcasting. Joe Rogan's down the street. It just gets crazier and
[2:26:02.620 --> 2:26:07.620]  crazier. But Dan, I've been out with you guys, been on your show four or five times. You've
[2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:11.900]  been here a few times. You're usually pretty laid back. I can see you're upset, but also
[2:26:11.900 --> 2:26:20.140]  because I feel the same way. So tell me if I'm wrong, but you feel this way, that you
[2:26:20.140 --> 2:26:24.860]  just can't believe it's so naked. It's so blatant. It's so criminal. It's expanding,
[2:26:24.860 --> 2:26:28.900]  and nothing's happening. And it's just shocking, like watching a train wreck that's little
[2:26:28.900 --> 2:26:33.700]  children, and they have Senate reports admitting they're going to sex slavers in many cases,
[2:26:33.700 --> 2:26:38.380]  and they're just disappearing, these ghost children, and our government's involved. And
[2:26:38.380 --> 2:26:42.740]  it's the realization that they're that arrogant. They're that crazy. They're committing a crime
[2:26:42.740 --> 2:26:47.180]  this big. How the hell do they think they're going to get away with it? And we were just
[2:26:47.180 --> 2:26:50.900]  talking about that. So, I mean, is that afterwards? Is that how you're feeling?
[2:26:50.900 --> 2:26:55.620]  Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's like someone lying right to your face. Unbelievable that
[2:26:55.620 --> 2:27:00.460]  they would have the audacity to do that. And it's even more unbelievable that anybody would
[2:27:00.460 --> 2:27:07.060]  even consider creating programs that target children. And that's the real issue here.
[2:27:07.060 --> 2:27:12.460]  Predators, and I can't think of any other reason why it's something like this would exist,
[2:27:12.460 --> 2:27:18.140]  to be honest. It's not for votes. Children can't vote, right? There's this idea that
[2:27:18.140 --> 2:27:22.060]  the Democrats want to get as many illegals in here, and then get them legalized as possible
[2:27:22.060 --> 2:27:26.460]  to vote. Maybe that's true, but the children part doesn't make sense. And it only leads
[2:27:26.460 --> 2:27:30.700]  in wonder. Whenever children are involved, it always leads to the same thing. It always
[2:27:30.700 --> 2:27:36.700]  leads to exactly the same thing, and that's predatory behavior. Now, these predators,
[2:27:36.700 --> 2:27:40.620]  they prey on the weak because they're not strong. They're not alphas. They're beta male
[2:27:40.620 --> 2:27:45.500]  cucks that prey on the weak. And what's the old saying? You don't have to be faster than
[2:27:45.500 --> 2:27:49.100]  the bear. You just got to be faster than the other guy, right? So, just having a sticker
[2:27:49.100 --> 2:27:52.340]  on your window that says you have an alarm system means that the burglar's going to go
[2:27:52.340 --> 2:27:55.300]  to the next house. Having a dog that barks means the burglar's going to go to the next
[2:27:55.300 --> 2:28:00.460]  house. These children have nobody protecting them. They have no one protecting them. And
[2:28:00.460 --> 2:28:05.580]  I can only imagine that this all exists in some kind of way for people to prey on children.
[2:28:05.580 --> 2:28:11.980]  Now, every time somebody like you or somebody else in the media or a podcast or whatever
[2:28:11.980 --> 2:28:19.060]  it is talks about how the government might be involved or Hollywood or the media or politicians
[2:28:19.060 --> 2:28:23.860]  or whomever it is, business people involved in the sexual exploitation of children. You're
[2:28:23.860 --> 2:28:27.940]  called a conspiracy theorist. This is crazy despite all the mountains of evidence we have
[2:28:27.940 --> 2:28:32.580]  to this effect. So, obviously, this is the first place my mind goes. What else would
[2:28:32.580 --> 2:28:36.700]  it be? And the fact that the media is covering it up shows they're complicit. And then you've
[2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:40.420]  got all the different things that come out about Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates. This
[2:28:40.420 --> 2:28:44.700]  is a currency. We know they use stolen art. They use drugs. Those are things that are
[2:28:44.700 --> 2:28:50.260]  secret currencies. But children and sex slavery is the big secret currency of the global.
[2:28:50.260 --> 2:28:54.580]  There's something nefarious going on there. I don't know what it is. But again, I don't
[2:28:54.580 --> 2:28:58.540]  have... I mean, Occam's razor says the most simple answer is probably the right one.
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:04.980]  How many times has the U.N. been caught trafficking? You talk about the media and their coverage
[2:29:04.980 --> 2:29:09.620]  of this, the blatant hypocrisy. In 2018, there were actually stories about this company,
[2:29:09.620 --> 2:29:15.620]  MVM Incorporated, because the media was trying to create this narrative that Trump was using
[2:29:15.620 --> 2:29:21.060]  MVM to separate children from their families. Now we know that's not true. Now we know that
[2:29:21.060 --> 2:29:24.380]  the Biden administration won't answer questions. We know that these kids are not being reunited
[2:29:24.380 --> 2:29:28.020]  with their families. We know that this private organization is being used as a cut out to
[2:29:28.020 --> 2:29:32.380]  the traffic children all over the United States. And we know that now, that it's Biden
[2:29:32.380 --> 2:29:34.900]  and not Trump, the media doesn't have a thing to say about it.
[2:29:34.900 --> 2:29:39.540]  And for folks that understand, but I saw that car. Do you want me to bring this up?
[2:29:39.540 --> 2:29:40.540]  Yeah, I did.
[2:29:40.540 --> 2:29:41.540]  You can remind you.
[2:29:41.540 --> 2:29:45.060]  Yeah. I mean, this is what we got to do, folks. This is what's got to happen. I'm not telling
[2:29:45.060 --> 2:29:50.340]  you to put yourself at personal risk. But there are things you can do to hold people accountable.
[2:29:50.340 --> 2:29:55.780]  You are allowed, under the First Amendment, to petition the government for answers. And
[2:29:55.780 --> 2:30:00.020]  it's not always in the form of a FOIA request. Sometimes you've got to get in people's faces.
[2:30:00.020 --> 2:30:04.180]  Do not get violent with these people because they win. They paint you as a violent extremist
[2:30:04.180 --> 2:30:07.940]  instead of somebody who is searching for the truth. You have to be better than them.
[2:30:07.940 --> 2:30:09.100]  Like Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
[2:30:09.100 --> 2:30:12.620]  Yes. These people are cowards. You have to be better than them. But you can take pictures.
[2:30:12.620 --> 2:30:15.300]  You can ask questions on video. You can demand answers.
[2:30:15.300 --> 2:30:19.020]  And just to explain, people thought this was staged. No, we're down there with a camera
[2:30:19.020 --> 2:30:23.420]  crew. They just loaded people off of us. Now they're being loaded in the back of a trunk
[2:30:23.420 --> 2:30:28.660]  of a car. And I noticed that was illegal. So I spontaneously said, stop. You're violating
[2:30:28.660 --> 2:30:32.340]  the law because the whole thing is illegal. Anyways, they're illegally being brought in
[2:30:32.340 --> 2:30:39.380]  the interior of the country. It turns out that people all have goddess of death tattoos
[2:30:39.380 --> 2:30:44.900]  all over them. This is real, folks. And the fact that they spit at us, Hispanic rights
[2:30:44.900 --> 2:30:47.300]  or something, they're exploiting these children.
[2:30:47.300 --> 2:30:55.780]  Yeah, I mean, it's the, you know, this woke nonsense. It's bankrupt. All it is is smoke
[2:30:55.780 --> 2:31:00.060]  and mirrors so they can push their agendas through. We don't know what they are necessarily,
[2:31:00.060 --> 2:31:03.140]  but we've got some pretty good theories about it. None of them lead in a good direction.
[2:31:03.140 --> 2:31:07.860]  Well, I mean, we went inside the building twice with an undercover police officer, a
[2:31:07.860 --> 2:31:12.900]  local woman that's a senior police officer. She's been there a long time. She goes in
[2:31:12.900 --> 2:31:18.300]  and we recorded it, by the way. And we've got all this in Spanish. We put it out and
[2:31:18.300 --> 2:31:22.620]  he's like, literally, she's watching this guy go, I only want women that don't have
[2:31:22.620 --> 2:31:28.100]  men. I can have these. I'm like, yes, sir, bring your van. You can have them. Good. I'm
[2:31:28.100 --> 2:31:32.620]  going to teach them the Lord my way. I mean, this is like out of some, like you said, it's
[2:31:32.620 --> 2:31:38.860]  like chainsaw massacre stuff. And, and literally then he sees the woman run out. He follows
[2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:43.420]  the female police officer in plain clothes out and starts confronting our people. Right.
[2:31:43.420 --> 2:31:49.700]  It's it's ultimately you want to get back to these people got to work. I'm going to
[2:31:49.700 --> 2:31:55.020]  make them work. Don't you like them? It's man. You couldn't cast somebody this creepy.
[2:31:55.020 --> 2:31:59.940]  That's very bizarre. It's very bizarre. You know what I mean? And it's it's and again,
[2:31:59.940 --> 2:32:05.180]  it's coming down to people who can't defend themselves. The entire point of masculinity,
[2:32:05.180 --> 2:32:10.380]  the entire point of police officers or the military of all these, just from that. Yeah,
[2:32:10.380 --> 2:32:14.340]  it's to provide and protect. It's it's not to dominate. It's to provide and protect.
[2:32:14.340 --> 2:32:17.940]  You can tell when a real alpha walks in the room, they don't have to yell because everybody
[2:32:17.940 --> 2:32:21.620]  knows they've just walked in the room. All these people that are fronting and pretending
[2:32:21.620 --> 2:32:25.260]  to be tough and all this stuff and all this crap that's going on right now, you can tell
[2:32:25.260 --> 2:32:29.420]  these people are cowards. So what can you do personally? Well, I'll tell you what, what
[2:32:29.420 --> 2:32:35.140]  you did down at the border is completely legal. If you see a misdemeanor happening or a felon
[2:32:35.140 --> 2:32:40.180]  he having in your presence as a private citizen, you were allowed to stop that. Now, if it's
[2:32:40.180 --> 2:32:45.380]  a violent felony, you're allowed to stop that with violence. Right? So I would never
[2:32:45.380 --> 2:32:50.180]  advocate for you getting involved in violent stuff. There are plenty of good police officers.
[2:32:50.180 --> 2:32:55.140]  Most of the people I know work at CBP are really pissed off about this. They're the it's being
[2:32:55.140 --> 2:32:58.780]  taken out of their hands. They're being issued gag orders. Their jobs are being threatened
[2:32:58.780 --> 2:33:03.460]  if they say anything about this stuff. And the latest I heard from CBP, this is how the
[2:33:03.460 --> 2:33:08.900]  process goes. These unaccompanied children and women particularly show up. And they're
[2:33:08.900 --> 2:33:13.580]  sent off for COVID screening, right? And then they're never heard or seen again, heard from
[2:33:13.580 --> 2:33:17.380]  or seen again. That's where we are. They drop them off at the COVID center. And then they're
[2:33:17.380 --> 2:33:20.500]  ordered to not go any further. And then five months later, they're loaded in the back of
[2:33:20.500 --> 2:33:25.100]  a trunk. Right. Now these aren't CBP people involved. No, no, they're, they're, they're
[2:33:25.100 --> 2:33:28.780]  doing everything they can to make sure the stuff doesn't happen. And the ball is being
[2:33:28.780 --> 2:33:32.900]  taken out of their hand. We, we've got to find out who's doing this. We have to find
[2:33:32.900 --> 2:33:36.100]  out. The war patrol drops them off 50 yards down the street right there, right past those
[2:33:36.100 --> 2:33:40.060]  police cars. Yeah. And it's, they're dropping them off at COVID centers, right? COVID centers
[2:33:40.060 --> 2:33:43.580]  right there. Yeah. Yeah. And that's what they're required to do by federal law right
[2:33:43.580 --> 2:33:47.900]  now. And it's, it's, you know, it's never when the COVID thing's over, it won't even
[2:33:47.900 --> 2:33:52.540]  be that. Who knows what it'll be then, but they always come up with something. And people,
[2:33:52.540 --> 2:33:55.900]  people like to look at laws individually, but it is the culmination of groups of laws
[2:33:55.900 --> 2:34:00.860]  that become problematic. So you can make violent speech illegal. And everybody's like, yeah,
[2:34:00.860 --> 2:34:04.500]  that maybe, maybe it should be. I don't know. But then you'd start to redefine what violent
[2:34:04.500 --> 2:34:06.820]  speech is down the line and you can make everything illegal.
[2:34:06.820 --> 2:34:12.180]  Stay there. Final segment with Dan Holloway. I'm Alex Jones. This is live right now. This
[2:34:12.180 --> 2:34:17.180]  is going to be archived later today to band up video. Everybody get it. Share it. What
[2:34:17.180 --> 2:34:20.980]  do you think we should call this special report we've done so far here today? I would call
[2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:25.300]  it government sanctioned human trafficking, Alice, because that's what it is. So major
[2:34:25.300 --> 2:34:30.340]  discovery of government sponsored. I mean, because it's a major break confirming government
[2:34:30.340 --> 2:34:32.340]  sponsored illegal human traffic. Yeah.
[2:34:32.340 --> 2:34:37.100]  Let's talk about Biden and all the lawless sister. We're getting ready to try to indict
[2:34:37.100 --> 2:34:40.940]  former president Trump. They stole the election from while they're committing all these incredible
[2:34:40.940 --> 2:34:45.660]  crimes. This is just insane. Well, they're right back in full wars.com. Tomorrow's news
[2:34:45.660 --> 2:34:46.660]  today.
[2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:54.660]  I don't really need to sell you on how beat concentrate is really good for your heart,

[2:35:02.980 --> 2:35:07.900]  I went out to a top lab and I said, what is the strongest be concentrate? You can do
[2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:11.860]  a copy of the popular formula you have. They explained that their formula had a certain
[2:35:11.860 --> 2:35:15.780]  percentage. And I said, just like the body's ultimate turmeric formula, for the average
[2:35:15.780 --> 2:35:20.220]  competitors at five per secret humanoid, I said, no one else does 95. That's the highest
[2:35:20.220 --> 2:35:25.220]  level. I said, give me 95 per secret humanoid didn't even cost much more. And we have 95
[2:35:25.220 --> 2:35:30.220]  per secret humanoid. Well, it's the same thing here. This is a very strong beat extract.

[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:55.560]  It's very bittersweet.
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:58.400]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:00.480]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:02.080]  I care about beating the new world border.
[2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:07.320]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:10.560]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[2:38:10.560 --> 2:38:13.400]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[2:38:13.400 --> 2:38:17.800]  We're going to see this through to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:21.440]  So please pray for us and please buy the products and mfoworkstore.com.

[2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:27.840]  Do they fund freedom?
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:29.200]  No, a lot of them don't.
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:33.880]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[2:38:33.880 --> 2:38:35.680]  up and looking for truth.
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:37.320]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:40.760]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:44.240]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:45.320]  Download everything we've done.
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:48.840]  You can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:53.880]  the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:58.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:10.360]  All right, folks, final segment with Dan Holloway, a great guy to a great work.
[2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:16.520]  And, you know, saw this guy, saw what was going on, had his military training and contacted
[2:39:16.520 --> 2:39:20.000]  the sources, checked out who the guy was, found out, indeed, these people do secret
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:23.360]  stuff for the U.S. government, there they are smuggling children.
[2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:27.320]  And just because Biden says it's legal doesn't doesn't make it so it violates a lot of federal
[2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:28.320]  state laws.
[2:39:28.320 --> 2:39:31.160]  The FBI doesn't have the power to say, don't do background checks on these people.
[2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:32.160]  They just don't have that power.
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:36.000]  I don't want to be enemies with the FBI, but the FBI is the enemy of itself allowing this.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.600]  I mean, my God, I feel dirty just knowing this is happening.
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:43.480]  And I feel like I haven't done enough and I've done something, the FBI, all of you,
[2:39:43.480 --> 2:39:47.560]  the whole damn country is being spiritually compromised.
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:48.560]  That's why they're doing this.
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:49.560]  It's not just for the pedophilia.
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:50.920]  It's not just for the trapping.
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:52.240]  It's not just George Soros.
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:54.520]  It's not just replacement migration.
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:59.520]  It's about spiritually getting us to do evil things in my view so they can basically lower
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:00.520]  our defenses.
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:03.440]  I mean, that is a that's a that's a pretty good point because that's kind of how it
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:06.720]  operates with Scientology, how it operated with Epstein, right?
[2:40:06.720 --> 2:40:12.800]  This job was to compromise people's integrity so you could use it against them later.
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:17.680]  Seems like what's happening here, we keep moving the goalposts on what's acceptable.
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:22.520]  I can tell you this, they've reached, as you said, they've crossed the Rubicon now, victimizing
[2:40:22.520 --> 2:40:25.800]  children is where the line gets drawn in any case.
[2:40:25.800 --> 2:40:26.800]  Absolutely.
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:31.160]  Well, this is not a long time since my uncle worked in Iran, Contra, and his final deal
[2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:36.040]  to get out of it was they were using it as a covering Guatemala and he told me this when
[2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:42.480]  I was like 15 years old was to traffic children out of orphanages, that's all he would say.
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:44.960]  And so that was in the that was in the 1980s.
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:45.960]  Well, I'm sure.
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:49.760]  I mean, look, victimizing helpless people is nothing new.
[2:40:49.760 --> 2:40:50.760]  Yeah.
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:53.520]  Now it's people in doing it for years because they can and nobody stops them.
[2:40:53.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  What is what Edmund Burke said?
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:57.520]  The only thing that evil needs to succeed is for good men to do nothing.
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:40:59.880]  Well, it's time for good men to start doing some stuff.
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:00.880]  It really is.
[2:41:00.880 --> 2:41:03.120]  I mean, we've we've we've reached the precipice here.
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:04.320]  Well, I'll go to the border.
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:09.280]  You know, I'm going to go have a little bit of a name drop, but I'm going to go have lunch
[2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:13.800]  this Saturday with Ted Nugent, his wife and my family, and he wants to go to the border.
[2:41:13.800 --> 2:41:15.800]  So I think we should all go down there with Ted Nugent.
[2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:16.800]  Yeah.
[2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:17.800]  Yeah.
[2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:18.800]  I mean, he's a Ted's good guy.
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:19.800]  He really is.
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:24.920]  He tries hard to get he's he's so much more positive now than he used to be.
[2:41:24.920 --> 2:41:25.920]  And I like that.
[2:41:25.920 --> 2:41:28.880]  I like people that are positive for a good reason because ultimately they're trying to
[2:41:28.880 --> 2:41:29.880]  make the country better.
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:30.880]  You know what I mean?
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:34.600]  I mean, as a man, you want to make your you want to take care of your family, then you
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:38.040]  want to take care of your city, your county, your state, your country.
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:40.480]  And then he works really, he works really, really hard.
[2:41:40.480 --> 2:41:42.880]  But we're probably going to go down there with him, so hopefully with us.
[2:41:42.880 --> 2:41:43.880]  Yeah.
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:47.600]  We need to have a big rally down there like in the because the locals are on our side,
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:48.600]  by the way.
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:49.600]  Right.
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:50.600]  I'm sure they are.
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:53.280]  Look, and that woman you keep seeing, by the way, they keep saying she's the mothers
[2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:54.280]  of these people.
[2:41:54.280 --> 2:41:57.200]  I guarantee you she is a member of the Catholic Church down there.
[2:41:57.200 --> 2:41:58.320]  Oh, we know who she is.
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:02.520]  They run this, let this Catholic charity that's admittedly communist, and then she's got
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:03.520]  debt.
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:06.200]  She's got grim reaper tattoos all over and we have her over in kids everywhere saying
[2:42:06.200 --> 2:42:07.200]  I am their parent.
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:11.000]  Now, what would the Catholic Church know about a victimizing children?
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  A lot.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  You're right.
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  Sorry about that.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  Yeah.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  This is this is wild stuff.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:18.840]  And I can tell you there's only a couple of things that are really going to stop it.
[2:42:18.840 --> 2:42:22.440]  The first thing is to get involved, be aware and start talking about it.
[2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:23.440]  Share this stuff.
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:26.200]  Let people know what's going on because the more people that know the less acceptable
[2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:29.720]  this becomes, the next thing is that you need to personally get involved.
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:33.320]  When you're out in town, when you see particularly people here in Texas, Southern California
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:37.600]  and border states, when you see stuff like this happening, and it typically happens with
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:41.680]  them 100 quote unquote air miles from the border, you have to document it and report
[2:42:41.680 --> 2:42:42.680]  it.
[2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:43.680]  Send it to Alex.
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:44.680]  Send it to me.
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:45.680]  Send it to okay.
[2:42:45.680 --> 2:42:46.680]  Yeah.
[2:42:46.680 --> 2:42:47.680]  Just because they say child trafficking is legal, it's not.
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:48.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:49.680]  The last thing is what it says right here on my shirt.
[2:42:49.680 --> 2:42:51.320]  Defund politicians.
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:58.600]  That slick back trader Mitt Romney with his corporations are people, my friend, nonsense.
[2:42:58.600 --> 2:43:03.200]  That is why there's so much power in government now where there wasn't 20 years ago.
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:05.440]  It's why people like Soros were able to operate.
[2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:09.520]  It's why this Swiss guy, this new Swiss guy that's donating all this money to all these
[2:43:09.520 --> 2:43:14.280]  leftist campaigns are able to operate because government runs on money and it shouldn't.
[2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:18.600]  And criminals are always going to push the envelope and the more we give in, the worse
[2:43:18.600 --> 2:43:19.600]  it gets.
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:22.600]  And so do I into several things.
[2:43:22.600 --> 2:43:24.600]  What did you bring up during the break?
[2:43:24.600 --> 2:43:25.600]  I forget.
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:33.920]  Well, as John Cena, I mean, look, the geopolitics is complicated and Hong Kong and Taiwan ultimately
[2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:37.840]  will have to decide their futures, just like everybody else has to decide their futures.
[2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:44.760]  But John Cena's response to accidentally saying that Taiwan was a country was to say
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:47.520]  that he respected China.
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:53.320]  Now I don't know how you can respect a country that has 1200 active camps for people that
[2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:56.800]  are Uighur Muslims where they're being executed, where their organs are being harvested, where
[2:43:56.800 --> 2:43:57.800]  they're being raped.
[2:43:57.800 --> 2:43:58.800]  I'm sorry.
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:00.600]  I mean, John Cena just something about him is revolting.
[2:44:00.600 --> 2:44:02.640]  He comes off as fake as Kamala Harris.
[2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:03.640]  I don't like it.
[2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:04.640]  Yeah.
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:07.600]  He's, look, he started that movie, The Marine, I can tell you what a real Marine would never
[2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:12.240]  do and that's sell his country out to China for money, frankly.
[2:44:12.240 --> 2:44:16.480]  This guy is a coward and a real piece of human garbage.
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:18.760]  And I hope, I hope that comes back to get him.
[2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:20.160]  Like, I hope he loses everything.
[2:44:20.160 --> 2:44:23.840]  In fact, can we play him speaking Mandarin as we have the audio?
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:53.640]  I go ahead and roll this, this, this groveling to the chai comms, here it is.
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:45:02.080]  What's your dragon called?
[2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:16.800]  These people will say that they didn't, they're not informed enough to speak out about what's
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:17.800]  happening in China.
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:21.320]  But he took the time to learn Mandarin to apologize to, you know what I mean?
[2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:24.760]  That was LeBron James' whole thing, like, oh, I think Daryl Morris, ignorant or misinformed
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:25.760]  about this situation.
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:29.960]  What do you need to know other than the fact that they have 1200 concentration camps?
[2:45:29.960 --> 2:45:32.480]  2021, man, I thought we were past that.
[2:45:32.480 --> 2:45:36.960]  Well, the worst part is LeBron James, America sucks, is horribly made $500 million.
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:41.320]  He does whatever he wants and then he's, and then he's telling us how good China is.
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:43.040]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's a laugh.
[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:44.040]  What?
[2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:46.040]  There was one other thing you raised during the break you wanted to get to.
[2:45:46.040 --> 2:45:47.040]  Oh man.
[2:45:47.040 --> 2:45:48.040]  I don't remember.
[2:45:48.040 --> 2:45:49.040]  We talked about a lot of stuff.
[2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:50.040]  Something important too.
[2:45:50.040 --> 2:45:52.040]  I mean, ultimately, we got to figure out how we're going to go.
[2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:53.040]  It was an awesome mayor.
[2:45:53.040 --> 2:45:54.040]  Oh yeah.
[2:45:54.040 --> 2:45:55.040]  Adler.
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:45:56.040]  Geez, this guy.
[2:45:56.040 --> 2:45:57.040]  I was telling you, he was on Joe Rogan.
[2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:00.080]  I drive, I live downtown, so I drive past City Hall every single day on my way back and
[2:46:00.080 --> 2:46:02.240]  forth from work, right?
[2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:06.160]  And we, there was this bill passed where they were going to clean up the homeless situation
[2:46:06.160 --> 2:46:07.160]  down there.
[2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:11.120]  And now not only is it not cleaned up, but they're all camped out on City Hall property,
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:12.120]  you know what I mean?
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:13.880]  And that just tells you how weak this guy is.
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:15.160]  I mean, he is completely incompetent.
[2:46:15.160 --> 2:46:16.360]  Now, what did he say on Rogan?
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:17.360]  I haven't heard this.
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:25.160]  Well, it's in a full report that our crew put out this morning, but he actually said
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:30.240]  we basically have imported criminals to keep the property values down and to not make Austin
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:34.520]  grow too much, which is the whole green deal is to sabotage, cut our pipelines off, cut
[2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:36.600]  our energy off, cut our coal plants off.
[2:46:36.600 --> 2:46:38.920]  So here he is on Joe Rogan this week.
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:41.640]  You have a desirable place to live.
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:43.240]  Anything is short of that.
[2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:45.840]  The idea that maybe the city shouldn't grow?
[2:46:45.840 --> 2:46:46.840]  Yes.
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:50.480]  Like I'm sure there must be some resistance about that, like people like, look, we should
[2:46:50.480 --> 2:46:53.400]  keep it exactly the way it is as long as we can.
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:55.560]  Don't let more people build.
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:58.120]  And if they're going to move here and there's no houses, guess what?
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:03.240]  You can't move here or move outside of town or, you know, figure it out, but don't ruin
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:04.240]  this thing.
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:08.040]  When I ran for reelection, there were lots of people coming up to me and there one ask
[2:47:08.040 --> 2:47:12.000]  was that I would stop the city from growing, you know, but as I explained to people, there's
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:15.080]  only one way to really stop a city from growing.
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:16.080]  Bring in crime.
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:17.080]  Bring in crime.
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:18.800]  Make it a desirable place to live.
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:20.400]  Anything is short of that.
[2:47:20.400 --> 2:47:21.400]  I know.
[2:47:21.400 --> 2:47:23.280]  And a desirable place is going to grow.
[2:47:23.280 --> 2:47:24.840]  So, but that's what he did.
[2:47:24.840 --> 2:47:32.160]  So it's very tongue-in-cheek, but boy, again, brazen, he does the social distance, he flew
[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:33.160]  on private jets.
[2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:35.200]  They're like, your business has to say shut up.
[2:47:35.200 --> 2:47:36.880]  That's like serial killer behavior.
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:40.880]  Serial killers ultimately are all driven by ego and they want to get caught eventually
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:43.400]  because they want the world to see how smart they are.
[2:47:43.400 --> 2:47:48.080]  And you can see with the sociopaths like this guy, when it starts coming down to the end,
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:50.560]  they start giving up more and more information readily.
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:51.560]  Exactly.
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:52.560]  Clow Schwab.
[2:47:52.560 --> 2:47:53.560]  Let's do five more minutes.
[2:47:53.560 --> 2:47:57.600]  Clow Schwab wrote a book that came out like one month into COVID that he written five
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:47:58.600]  years before.
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:01.880]  A lot of his quotes about we did this to take over and cut the carbon and you got too much
[2:48:01.880 --> 2:48:04.120]  money and we need to starve the third world.
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:08.320]  We're going to give you GMO, Franken shots, and I mean, you read this thing, it's like
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:10.800]  a supervillain just telling you what he's doing.
[2:48:10.800 --> 2:48:17.120]  It's like that really cheesy scene right at the towards the end of a movie where the villain
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:21.280]  lays out their entire plan while he has the guy tied up to a chair, then he escapes and
[2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:22.280]  stops.
[2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:25.160]  And when I was a kid, I'd watch that and go, if I was a supervillain, I would never do
[2:48:25.160 --> 2:48:26.160]  that.
[2:48:26.160 --> 2:48:27.160]  Well, I'm on a supervillain.
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:30.800]  I've now lived long enough to actually know criminals will actually sit there and do that.
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:31.800]  Yeah.
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:32.800]  It is exactly like that.
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:39.800]  And the real bane of my existence right now is that these are all solvable problems.
[2:48:39.800 --> 2:48:45.920]  This issue with border security, these issues with illegal immigration, we're having big
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:46.920]  problems right now.
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:47.920]  I've got to go to break.
[2:48:47.920 --> 2:48:49.680]  Come back a few more minutes and we've got our next guest coming in, but I appreciate
[2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:50.680]  you being here.
[2:48:50.680 --> 2:48:54.120]  I want to talk about Obama, the globalist, there was a Freudian slip, that's a little
[2:48:54.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  run things.
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:00.200]  O Biden, O Harris, and I want to get into what we can do, how this is illegal and kind of
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:02.880]  sum up what we were just talking about right ahead.
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:07.360]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we're listed supported without your funding,
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:08.360]  we go away.
[2:49:08.360 --> 2:49:09.360]  We're doing a lot of important work.
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:11.240]  We have great supplements, great products.
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:14.840]  We have a store-wide free shipping deal for Memorial Day for the next week and double
[2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:15.840]  Patriot Points.
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:21.040]  DNA Force Plus is back in stock, Prostaguard back in stock, Pollen Block is back in stock.
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:22.040]  These all work great.
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:25.880]  Ulfer12 is back in stock, Bazzo beats back in stock and our air filtration and water
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:29.960]  filtration are both $50 off for the highest qualities and our Ionic.
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:34.720]  Double magnesium drink that tastes so good, that's so popular just as it came out.
[2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:40.040]  It is 40% off as well with free shipping infowarstore.com.
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:45.120]  I share with you the viewers and listeners the facts of where info wars is and it's always
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:49.480]  a complex picture but I do my best to explain it to you because you are the patrons that
[2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:51.360]  make all this possible.
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:56.640]  So in short, the world's awakening, the spiral of censorship, info wars has never been more
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:50:00.960]  influential and has never had a bigger effect exposing the global's agenda and fighting
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:01.960]  it.
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:07.160]  Instead, the COVID lockdowns, the shutdown of supply chains has almost shut us down because
[2:50:07.160 --> 2:50:11.080]  most of the best selling products which you want to buy like DNA Force Plus and others
[2:50:11.080 --> 2:50:13.120]  have been sold out for up to seven months.
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:14.120]  Well guess what?
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:19.520]  DNA Force Plus just came back in, thank God for seven months, it's 40% off, it's amazing
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:23.920]  at infowarsore.com and for the week leading up through Memorial Day, we have store-wide
[2:50:23.920 --> 2:50:28.680]  free shipping and double Patriot Points and Alpha Powers back in stock and Super Mill
[2:50:28.680 --> 2:50:32.680]  Vitality's back in stock and Pollen Block and Vaso Beach, they're all back in stock
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:37.840]  as much as 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, infowarsore.com.
[2:50:37.840 --> 2:50:41.200]  Thanks for keeping us on the air, info warriors.
[2:50:41.200 --> 2:50:45.280]  You know, I'm cutting the ad right now and I've been here on the Saturday cutting days,
[2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:50.720]  I'm doing a terrible job because I just cut like five ads and I didn't tell people the
[2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:52.400]  most important part.
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:57.720]  No, it's not that DNA Force Plus has been sold out for seven months and it's back in
[2:50:57.720 --> 2:51:02.160]  stock and it's 40% off, or how the supply chain broke down and how it almost bankrupted
[2:51:02.160 --> 2:51:06.760]  us, but thank God it finally came in, or how it cleans up your mitochondria and makes
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:11.040]  your telomeres last longer and can regrow nerves, you've got to go research DNA Force
[2:51:11.040 --> 2:51:15.320]  Plus, no, it's not that, the reason I just cut all those ads and forgot the most important
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:20.520]  point, the Super Mill Vitality's back in stock, 50% off, the Prosthegard's back 40% off,
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:26.480]  the Alpha Powers back 50% off, the Ultra 12, Mountain B12, take another tongue, it's incredible,
[2:51:26.480 --> 2:51:32.600]  it's back, also 50% off, or Vazo Beach, back 50% off, no, it's that, we've got double
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:36.960]  Patriot points and free shipping's still alive, double Patriot points, free shipping's
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:44.880]  still alive on top of these huge sales.
[2:51:44.880 --> 2:52:02.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:06.520]  Dan Holloway's the one that's the last hour and it's a really important interview and
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:11.000]  so I just want to note to the listeners how big this is, just folks know I don't just
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:15.480]  say something big, let's just really big, that you identify the company, check the guy,
[2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:19.320]  know who it is, or hooked him with the US intelligence agencies, that you showed the
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:25.720]  government contracts, you did the backtracking and this just completes the circuit out of
[2:52:25.720 --> 2:52:31.360]  the third world into the US with children, with people that aren't their parents without
[2:52:31.360 --> 2:52:36.000]  knowing their identity, just being disappeared, I mean this is just the stuff of X-Files,
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:42.480]  the stuff of you guys had the big child molester hunter on, Chris Hanson, yeah last week,
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:47.840]  this is huge, this is the holy grail of what the Q people said all of it, hiding in plain
[2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:48.840]  view.
[2:52:48.840 --> 2:52:52.360]  I mean it's very suggestive of that, I can't say what's happening to the kids after the
[2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:56.400]  fact but I can't imagine it's anything good, I mean why would it be, if people were willing
[2:52:56.400 --> 2:53:02.600]  to go this far and break this many laws to get these kids here and then disappear them,
[2:53:02.600 --> 2:53:03.600]  what else is happening?
[2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:08.160]  And that's all a crime, but remember the Senate report found tens of thousands of kids placed
[2:53:08.160 --> 2:53:11.600]  with smugglers, many of which ended up in sex slavery, that's a Senate report.
[2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:15.800]  Yep, it is, and it's the thing that there's two things that really just destroy me about
[2:53:15.800 --> 2:53:19.040]  this, one is that the kids are being victimized and that our national sovereignty is being
[2:53:19.040 --> 2:53:22.760]  victimized, the other thing there's an easy solution to all this immigration stuff, you
[2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:27.200]  know what you can't buy right now is a new truck or a PlayStation 5, do you know why?
[2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:31.600]  Because China will not release semiconductors to us, we can't get processing chips, we put
[2:53:31.600 --> 2:53:35.840]  all of our eggs into the Chinese technological basket, which seems like a horrible idea to
[2:53:35.840 --> 2:53:36.840]  do, but we did it anyway.
[2:53:36.840 --> 2:53:38.080]  Which is what Trump pointed out.
[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:42.040]  By the way, the largest lithium reserves in the world are in Chile, a country we have
[2:53:42.040 --> 2:53:45.120]  pretty good relations with, it's just south of here, so if we were able to...
[2:53:45.120 --> 2:53:48.720]  And Biden just said we're not going to allow any of our companies to do that, we're going
[2:53:48.720 --> 2:53:49.720]  to buy from China.
[2:53:49.720 --> 2:53:50.720]  Right, exactly, yeah.
[2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:51.720]  So if we were...
[2:53:51.720 --> 2:53:53.560]  I'm talking about bending over it, Chelsea's fully owned by them.
[2:53:53.560 --> 2:53:58.440]  Of course, if we were able to create a pipeline for resource materials from Chile, up to
[2:53:58.440 --> 2:54:02.440]  Nicaragua, Guatemala, Mexico, all these illegal immigrants are coming from, build semiconductor
[2:54:02.440 --> 2:54:06.200]  processing plants, and those countries give those people jobs and hopes.
[2:54:06.200 --> 2:54:07.200]  And solar panels.
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:09.480]  And solar panels, give them jobs and hope.
[2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:10.480]  And none of this would even exist.
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:13.760]  And then that would make their town so nice, we'd be retiring down there.
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:14.760]  Yeah, like how...
[2:54:14.760 --> 2:54:16.920]  None of this is difficult to do.
[2:54:16.920 --> 2:54:20.200]  The stroke of a pen could make all this happen in about five years.
[2:54:20.200 --> 2:54:21.200]  And this would be over.
[2:54:21.200 --> 2:54:25.280]  And that's why the Mexican president signed on to Trump, because Trump had that point.
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:26.280]  Exactly, yeah.
[2:54:26.280 --> 2:54:29.160]  And he was definitely trying to do it, and it's...
[2:54:29.160 --> 2:54:32.720]  Even Mexico is upset with how many people are coming through their borders now.
[2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:33.720]  Like how...
[2:54:33.720 --> 2:54:37.120]  Well, I'm proud of Mexico now saying Trump was actually good and Biden sucks.
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:38.960]  Yeah, I mean, it's...
[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:40.520]  People were upset about me and tweets.
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:42.080]  I'll tell you, who loves you?
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:47.200]  The person that coddles you while you're putting a fork into an electrical socket, or the person
[2:54:47.200 --> 2:54:49.560]  that slaps out of your hand and calls you an idiot.
[2:54:49.560 --> 2:54:52.640]  One's nice, I guess, one's not nice, but the results speak for themselves.
[2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:54.760]  You don't get electrocuted.
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:56.480]  You get the fork slapped out of your hand.
[2:54:56.480 --> 2:54:59.480]  Instead, the globalists are handing the child the fork.
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:00.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:55:00.480 --> 2:55:01.480]  And teaching them how to put it in.
[2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:03.920]  I mean, this is unbelievable what's happening here.
[2:55:03.920 --> 2:55:08.120]  And again, to go back to what we were talking about before, people need to start getting
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:09.120]  involved.
[2:55:09.120 --> 2:55:10.120]  You've got to share this stuff.
[2:55:10.120 --> 2:55:11.120]  You have to talk to people about it.
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:13.920]  And you have to do it in a way that they're going to receive the information.
[2:55:13.920 --> 2:55:16.560]  You can't insult people and give them information at the same time.
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:18.000]  They don't receive it that way.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  That's right.
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:20.520]  And in one minute, how do you quantify this interview?
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:23.520]  Because I'm going to go right ahead, line for this, I'm going to feature it as an interview,
[2:55:23.520 --> 2:55:27.080]  so we get some million views, more of the listeners get excited about it, and we can
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:28.080]  save children.
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:32.280]  Because, I mean, actually sharing this with legislatures and Congress and radio hosts
[2:55:32.280 --> 2:55:34.000]  and others, we don't even want the credit.
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:37.800]  They can all just go do their own report on this, but everybody's got to get on this.
[2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:40.120]  Yeah, that's what's got to happen.
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:44.880]  The summation of all this is that because of a runaway, a legal immigration situation
[2:55:44.880 --> 2:55:48.800]  with catch-of-release and all this stuff, the worst people you can imagine have decided
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:54.080]  to prey on the system and set it up so that they could traffic children and that those
[2:55:54.080 --> 2:55:58.240]  traffic children completely disappear and are outside of our realm of responsibility
[2:55:58.240 --> 2:55:59.740]  forever.
[2:55:59.740 --> 2:56:00.740]  We can't see them.
[2:56:00.740 --> 2:56:01.740]  We don't get any reports.
[2:56:01.740 --> 2:56:04.640]  The Biden administration won't talk to us about it.
[2:56:04.640 --> 2:56:05.800]  That's where we are right now.
[2:56:05.800 --> 2:56:09.560]  Children are being victimized by predators, and they've been allowed to do that by the
[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:10.560]  United States.
[2:56:10.560 --> 2:56:14.840]  And Biden said, as soon as I'm elected, immediately rush the border.
[2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:17.040]  I didn't hear him say that, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[2:56:17.040 --> 2:56:18.040]  I swear to God.
[2:56:18.040 --> 2:56:19.040]  He would up.
[2:56:19.040 --> 2:56:23.200]  In fact, in post, we're live right now, we'll add, Biden said once I'm elected, immediately
[2:56:23.200 --> 2:56:25.760]  surge the border.
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:30.680]  I just don't understand, other than some kind of victimization, what the possible reason
[2:56:30.680 --> 2:56:32.280]  for any of this could be.
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:34.560]  Listen, you've never seen this clip?
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:35.560]  No.
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:36.560]  Word for word.
[2:56:36.560 --> 2:56:37.560]  I know it doesn't sound real.
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:38.560]  All right, Dan Holloway.
[2:56:38.560 --> 2:56:39.560]  Great to have you.
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:40.560]  Good job, brother.
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:41.560]  Thanks, man.
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:42.560]  Thank you very much.
[2:56:42.560 --> 2:56:43.560]  See you soon.
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:44.560]  Great job.
[2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:45.560]  Everybody get the information out.
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:56:46.560]  All right, we'll be right back.
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:53.560]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners this broadcast, and then I've
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:56:56.200]  got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:57:00.320]  Yes, I could spend an hour telling you about how the globals are getting exposed and how
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:04.560]  they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are
[2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:05.560]  in.
[2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:08.480]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:11.720]  and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try to make people wear masks.
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:16.520]  I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:18.760]  good news concerning the M4?
[2:57:18.760 --> 2:57:22.800]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day Special
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:29.960]  for the next week only with store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, and DNA Force
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:37.160]  Plus is back in stock, sold out for seven months, 40% off, Supermobotality, 50% off,
[2:57:37.160 --> 2:57:43.760]  Prostigard, 40% off, Alba Power, 50%, Ultra 1200%, DAZOV, 50%, free shipping, and Patriot
[2:57:43.760 --> 2:57:49.760]  Points, and the M4, and its incredible products, and George Soros hates it, ha-ha!
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:58.760]  News, analysis, reports, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:05.760]  Sweet dreams are made of the years, who am I to disagree?
[2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:09.760]  I travel the world and the seven seas.
[2:58:09.760 --> 2:58:16.360]  When you are overthrowing a government, the local police are obviously going to be a problem.
[2:58:16.360 --> 2:58:22.200]  After the Bolshevik Revolution, a secret police force was created to purge the public of any
[2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:24.960]  political opposition.
[2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:30.400]  After Hitler came to power, the Nazification of local police departments took only three
[2:58:30.400 --> 2:58:37.560]  years, leaving a fully centralized police force under the control of SS leader Heinrich
[2:58:37.560 --> 2:58:41.240]  Himmler by 1936.
[2:58:41.240 --> 2:58:48.840]  In Venezuela, Maduro created a paramilitary force and employs non-state actors to fight
[2:58:48.840 --> 2:58:51.680]  against citizen patriots.
[2:58:51.680 --> 2:58:56.960]  It's an obvious priority when you plan on overthrowing a country and eliminating people's
[2:58:56.960 --> 2:59:02.120]  constitutional rights, then you have to deal with the police who have sworn an oath to
[2:59:02.120 --> 2:59:04.520]  protect those rights.
[2:59:04.520 --> 2:59:07.320]  And we are now witnessing this in America.
[2:59:07.320 --> 2:59:12.560]  In Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler came to power as one of the biggest landowners of
[2:59:12.560 --> 2:59:18.400]  Austin and spends most of his time perched above the city in the tallest penthouse,
[2:59:18.400 --> 2:59:19.960]  which is fitting.
[2:59:19.960 --> 2:59:26.240]  Adler does not act according to the will of the people, but rather as their king.
[2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:31.440]  When asked by Weiss if he regretted ending the camping band, which has unquestionably
[2:59:31.440 --> 2:59:36.640]  brought thousands of dangerous transients from all over the country into the once safe
[2:59:36.640 --> 2:59:42.920]  streets of Austin, he proudly admits to forcing his own disruptive agenda upon the people
[2:59:42.920 --> 2:59:43.920]  of Austin.
[2:59:43.920 --> 2:59:45.680]  Was it a mistake to lift the ban?
[2:59:45.680 --> 2:59:50.120]  It was absolutely not a mistake to lift the ban.
[2:59:50.120 --> 2:59:55.400]  I think that sometimes you really need disruptive action if you're trying to make change.
[2:59:55.400 --> 3:00:00.840]  He arrogantly goes on to say that if the people vote to reinstate the camping ban, which has
[3:00:00.840 --> 3:00:04.280]  since happened, that nothing will change.
[3:00:04.280 --> 3:00:08.640]  So I'm concerned about it passing and creating an expectation in some parts of our community
[3:00:08.640 --> 3:00:14.400]  that somehow or another these people will at that point disappear because they won't.
[3:00:14.400 --> 3:00:20.040]  Some of these so-called homeless people are camping outside Austin City Hall, where they
[3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:23.960]  openly brag about going to war with the police.
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:27.720]  If it's a war they want, if it's a war they go to jail.
[3:00:27.720 --> 3:00:34.160]  LLM supporter and Travis County DA, Trudy Strasburger, recently posted a job ad looking
[3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:40.280]  for a heavy hitter who is looking to prosecute police officers.
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:47.480]  Austin City Council has brazenly decided to defund the police by $150 million.
[3:00:47.480 --> 3:00:52.560]  This along with having the streets filled with desperate transients has naturally resulted
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:58.480]  in a sharp increase of violent crimes, robberies and murders.
[3:00:58.480 --> 3:01:05.240]  Adler even joked with Joe Rogan how he succeeded at slowing Austin's growth by importing crime.
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:10.120]  You know, but as I explained to people, there's only one way to really stop a city from growing.
[3:01:10.120 --> 3:01:11.120]  Bring in crime.
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:12.120]  Bring in crime.
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:14.920]  Make it a desirable place to live.
[3:01:14.920 --> 3:01:16.920]  Order out of chaos.
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:21.520]  This is the job of Adler and his radical city council.
[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:25.880]  Troy, Texas from within and it's working.
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:32.160]  Our election system has been subverted and the population so brainwashed that Texans
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:38.320]  will likely elect Hollywood movie star Matthew McConaughey to be their next governor, proving
[3:01:38.320 --> 3:01:42.860]  once and for all that Texas is finished.
[3:01:42.860 --> 3:01:47.960]  If you don't think they can turn Texas into California, just give it a few years.
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:51.800]  The enemy's resolve seems to be far greater than our own.
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:56.200]  When radical local governments ignore the will of the people and the people no longer
[3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:08.520]  have a vote, then the only hope for survival is to stand up against them.
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:12.640]  That report is exploding right now at Band-Aid video.
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:15.920]  Will Texas resist the communist takeover?
[3:02:15.920 --> 3:02:23.440]  Free World News.TV is the URL that is the new URL that's not being blocked by Twitter,
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:27.280]  Facebook and other criminal operations at this point.
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:31.280]  Okay, we've got some bad news.
[3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:35.840]  Yes, there's thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people murdered,
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:40.040]  mainly women and children by Mexican cartels every year on the Mexican side of the border
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:43.480]  because they didn't pay full price for the coyotes.
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:45.680]  That's the smugglers.
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:50.280]  We talk about coyotes, they think we're talking about the smaller breed of wolf.
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:53.360]  No, we're talking about smugglers.
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:55.680]  But this is breaking NBC News.
[3:02:55.680 --> 3:03:02.320]  Transit employees among nine dead and shooting at San Jose Rail Yard, a public transit employee
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:09.040]  opened fire, so it's going postal, on coworkers at the Northern California Rail Yard Wednesday
[3:03:09.040 --> 3:03:13.880]  killing more than half a dozen people before taking his own life.
[3:03:13.880 --> 3:03:20.960]  Files of shots fired at about 6.34 a.m. on Younger Avenue in downtown San Jose, drawing
[3:03:20.960 --> 3:03:22.720]  a large law enforcement response.
[3:03:22.720 --> 3:03:27.440]  This went on hours ago, but now we have the number that it's nine dead.
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:31.720]  This was unfolding as the broadcast began, or a little bit shorter thereafter, but now
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:34.400]  we know the number nine dead.
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:41.080]  We hope, pray for those wounded and for the families of those that have lost loved ones.
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:42.080]  But here's the issue.
[3:03:42.080 --> 3:03:46.920]  We've got 200,000 dead in Mexico in the last decade from the fake drug war.
[3:03:46.920 --> 3:03:49.960]  They have a total gunband there.
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:53.440]  If you talk about everybody killed in mass shootings in the last 20 years, it's not
[3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:56.680]  even 3,000 people.
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:04:01.440]  On average, you've got about 65 children a year shot in schools.
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:03.560]  Most of us getting related, it's still too much.
[3:04:03.560 --> 3:04:05.120]  You've got a couple hundred people.
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:06.760]  On average, about 245.
[3:04:06.760 --> 3:04:10.160]  I've had Professor Lott on the top statistics of the world on about this.
[3:04:10.160 --> 3:04:16.800]  You can look it up yourself, but below 300 people killed in mass shootings every year.
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:18.920]  What you would call a senseless mass shooting.
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:24.320]  Chicago has over 2,000 shootings, though, that are gang on gang.
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:27.760]  So that's the bottom line, and there's the headline LA Times.
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:32.960]  There's only one gun store in all of Mexico, so why is gun violence soaring?
[3:04:32.960 --> 3:04:36.400]  Because people know that there's no way to protect themselves, the law is a fraud, so
[3:04:36.400 --> 3:04:38.080]  it becomes totally lawless.
[3:04:38.080 --> 3:04:44.960]  The social contract has been broken, and so the statistics are clear.
[3:04:44.960 --> 3:04:49.040]  Shootings and mass shootings peaked in about 1989.
[3:04:49.040 --> 3:04:52.400]  They began to drop in 1993.
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:05:01.920]  They dropped to all-time lows until 2015 or so, and since then, they have been steadily
[3:05:01.920 --> 3:05:02.920]  rising.
[3:05:02.920 --> 3:05:10.800]  But if you look at the graph, it's still way lower, the shootings overall dropped by half
[3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:15.840]  from 1992 until 2015 or so.
[3:05:15.840 --> 3:05:20.840]  There's a lot of reasons this happened, but the media hyping up mass shootings is what
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:26.800]  psychologists and others believe is causing it, because it's always an in-sell person
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:32.640]  that hates girls that doesn't school always, or it's a smaller number gang related, and
[3:05:32.640 --> 3:05:34.960]  they'll just call it a mass shooting, but it's like, you know, one guy shoots five
[3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:38.280]  gang members, still not good, but it's at least drug-related, you know, they're men
[3:05:38.280 --> 3:05:44.040]  fighting men, they're just in school, but acting like adults, acting like criminals.
[3:05:44.040 --> 3:05:51.080]  And then you've got, on top of that, all the suicides and the rest of it, and there are
[3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:57.560]  a lot of deaths over 10,000 a year using guns for suicide, but if you add it all together,
[3:05:57.560 --> 3:06:02.600]  guns are used way more often in defensive life than they're used to take life.
[3:06:02.600 --> 3:06:07.840]  But you have the in-sells that are out-killing people, guys that are mad at girls because
[3:06:07.840 --> 3:06:12.840]  the girls don't like them because they're creepy and we're never taught any type of
[3:06:12.840 --> 3:06:19.360]  basic confidence and no rights of passage, and then you've got the other big one that
[3:06:19.360 --> 3:06:26.800]  is workplace shootings, going postal, and so in-sell and workplace going postal is
[3:06:26.800 --> 3:06:29.400]  the main thing that's happening here.
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:37.200]  And it is evil in society, it is corruption, and it is people who are mad at somebody,
[3:06:37.200 --> 3:06:41.160]  and so they decide to go take those people's lives and then kill themselves.
[3:06:41.160 --> 3:06:45.360]  It's similar to suicide by cop, where somebody pulls a gun on the cops so the cop shoots
[3:06:45.360 --> 3:06:49.520]  them, but it's much worse than that, you're not just endangering a police officer's life
[3:06:49.520 --> 3:06:53.200]  and getting yourself killed by them because you're too cowardly to do it, now you're going
[3:06:53.200 --> 3:06:57.560]  and killing a bunch of innocent people.
[3:06:57.560 --> 3:07:05.760]  Is this who they're saying this uterus, or what is this, pardon me, that's the Virginia
[3:07:05.760 --> 3:07:08.600]  Tech shooter, that's what I thought, yeah.
[3:07:08.600 --> 3:07:15.960]  And so this just goes on and on and on, radio officers have to remember that I am doing a
[3:07:15.960 --> 3:07:19.840]  TV show at the same time, sometimes you'll hear me ask what is this, what is that, and
[3:07:19.840 --> 3:07:21.720]  that's because we're also on television.
[3:07:21.720 --> 3:07:27.480]  Right, we've got a special guest in studio with us who told us her story a few months
[3:07:27.480 --> 3:07:31.960]  ago, we looked into it, and we said if you're ever in Austin, you ought to pop by our studios
[3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:35.280]  and tell us, she's an award winning reporter, and if you want to know what's been going
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:40.640]  on in local TV news, and the type of political correctness and brainwashing going on, you
[3:07:40.640 --> 3:07:44.640]  want to know about it, you're about to find out straight ahead with Christie Lee, stay
[3:07:44.640 --> 3:07:47.920]  with us.
[3:07:47.920 --> 3:07:53.480]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminated water, soil, and subsurface material
[3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:57.920]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:07:59.880]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[3:07:59.880 --> 3:08:04.920]  For the first time, the bio-pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:06.960]  products to the everyday consumer.
[3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:11.640]  Their first product they are launching is called bioseptic pro, a product specifically
[3:08:11.640 --> 3:08:14.640]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[3:08:14.640 --> 3:08:19.000]  Bioseptic pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:20.920]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[3:08:20.920 --> 3:08:26.040]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank, and is at least 100 times more effective
[3:08:26.040 --> 3:08:30.800]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:35.280]  Bioseptic pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:39.280]  Visit thebio-pros.com today and protect your septic system.
[3:08:39.280 --> 3:08:41.240]  That's thebio-pros.com.
[3:08:41.240 --> 3:08:45.360]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks, and the job it does is unparalleled.
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:46.360]  Thebio-pros.com.
[3:08:46.360 --> 3:08:52.480]  One of the most common questions I get on air, but also off air when I'm just out and
[3:08:52.480 --> 3:08:57.560]  about is, Alex, what do I say to my family about the vaccines?
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:08:58.800]  How do I warn them?
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:02.720]  Well, the problem is there's so many problems with it, so many facts.
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:06.320]  It's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability protection
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:11.080]  in the US and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants and cancer
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:15.640]  viruses and other things to vaccines, and the whole history of secret experimentation
[3:09:15.640 --> 3:09:19.400]  on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans.
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:23.960]  The list goes on and on, but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and
[3:09:23.960 --> 3:09:32.760]  so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff,
[3:09:32.760 --> 3:09:35.720]  medical doctors, neurologist, scientists have refused to take the vaccine, and don't
[3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:36.720]  think it's safe?
[3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:40.680]  Yeah, I think what half of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in
[3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:43.920]  the private practice, is out there, some numbers, that that's not something I'm going to be
[3:09:43.920 --> 3:09:44.920]  taking.
[3:09:44.920 --> 3:09:45.920]  That's very, very simple.
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:46.920]  There's your answer.
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:53.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:10:16.280]  Well, we just had Dan Holloway, he used to be in Army Special Forces in a lot of really
[3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:17.280]  secretive areas.
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:22.520]  The job it was to hunt down terrorists, he went and hunted down, who is completing the
[3:10:22.520 --> 3:10:25.680]  smuggling of the children in the U.S. and had their information ran and found out who they
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:26.680]  were, just himself.
[3:10:26.680 --> 3:10:28.680]  We just exposed it here, that was major.
[3:10:28.680 --> 3:10:31.800]  We've got kind of another whistleblower in studio with us.
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:36.120]  We heard about her story and talked to her, Moscow instead of her ever in town, with
[3:10:36.120 --> 3:10:40.720]  your family or a fiance, you know, please, please come on air, and, well, she's here,
[3:10:40.720 --> 3:10:46.800]  Kristi Lee, KristiLeeTV.com, she's an award-winning TV journalist, enemy-nominated, multiple first
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:52.240]  place awards from Associated Press, Best Anchor and Best Enterprise Reporting, an outstanding
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:56.000]  broadcasting student award, back when she was in school many years ago, I'm not going
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  to go over her long bio, but the experiences that she's had, the way media has changed
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:07.920]  just the last few years, and even what she's been told, I don't want to go that far because
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:12.720]  of the evil color of your skin, but just to get an idea of the revolution of the military,
[3:11:12.720 --> 3:11:17.000]  law enforcement, media, it is intense, it's corporate-driven, and it's an in-game, and
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:21.280]  it's not to empower brown people, it's not to empower women, it's to empower somebody
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:22.280]  else.
[3:11:22.280 --> 3:11:23.280]  So, Kristi, it's great to have you here with us.
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:24.280]  Great to be here.
[3:11:24.280 --> 3:11:25.280]  Thank you.
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:29.040]  Well, you've got the floor all run on because I've talked to you a lot, and, you know, all
[3:11:29.040 --> 3:11:30.040]  fair.
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:31.040]  I want people to hear your story.
[3:11:31.040 --> 3:11:32.040]  It's pretty amazing.
[3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:34.920]  Well, obviously, it's taken me a long time to get to this point to want to share my story
[3:11:34.920 --> 3:11:39.440]  because when you build a career that you love and are passionate about and have done for
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:45.360]  so long to get to a point where you need to almost, like, feel like a rebel for standing
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:50.320]  up for journalistic integrity, it's difficult to get to that point where you feel comfortable
[3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:51.320]  doing it.
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:54.840]  Knowing, I mean, I'm appropriately wearing red because I know that after I do this, I'm
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:12:00.040]  going to have a big target on my back, you know, from other journalists just for calling
[3:12:00.040 --> 3:12:01.040]  out what I've observed.
[3:12:01.040 --> 3:12:07.360]  So, it really was over the past year that I mostly came to this realization that journalism
[3:12:07.360 --> 3:12:10.000]  had changed dramatically, and it's-
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  And you're breaking your silence now.
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  I should have pointed out that you're breaking your silence.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  This is my first time totally breaking my silence.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:16.000]  Yes.
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  Go ahead.
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:22.000]  So, over the past year, definitely different than what I learned in school, and it's just
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:25.600]  astonishing and shocking, really, that it's gotten to this point.
[3:12:25.600 --> 3:12:30.800]  I've been a main evening news anchor for about, well, nearly 10 years now.
[3:12:30.800 --> 3:12:36.040]  Went to school and learned one form of journalism, and then really this past year, it was something
[3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:38.840]  different that was unrecognizable to me.
[3:12:38.840 --> 3:12:41.560]  When I was in school, I learned we deliver information.
[3:12:41.560 --> 3:12:44.160]  We tell the story from our sources.
[3:12:44.160 --> 3:12:45.440]  We don't take a position.
[3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:47.960]  We don't take authority of information.
[3:12:47.960 --> 3:12:49.280]  We're just the messenger.
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:50.560]  We're just supposed to be the messenger.
[3:12:50.560 --> 3:12:52.680]  Well, that was not the case this past year.
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:55.200]  I was arguing with former colleagues.
[3:12:55.200 --> 3:12:58.680]  Really the turning point for me was what happened with the frontline doctors.
[3:12:58.680 --> 3:13:03.840]  I was so shocked that there was this censorship and that these former colleagues that I worked
[3:13:03.840 --> 3:13:05.240]  with were cheering it on.
[3:13:05.240 --> 3:13:06.880]  I'm like, guys, we're journalists.
[3:13:06.880 --> 3:13:07.880]  Take your time.
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:09.320]  We've got time because we're here in front.
[3:13:09.320 --> 3:13:12.600]  The breaking point was covering up what doctors are really saying.
[3:13:12.600 --> 3:13:13.600]  That was the last straw.
[3:13:13.600 --> 3:13:15.520]  These Facebook whistleblowers are high-level.
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:20.080]  They've given the documents to Project Veritas where they're told, it's the truthful stuff
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:21.880]  we want stopped of doctors.
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:23.200]  We don't care if it's true.
[3:13:23.200 --> 3:13:24.200]  You cover it up.
[3:13:24.200 --> 3:13:25.760]  I mean, this is criminal.
[3:13:25.760 --> 3:13:26.760]  It's crazy.
[3:13:26.760 --> 3:13:32.120]  It goes against, I believe, the tenets of journalism, which is to deliver the message.
[3:13:32.120 --> 3:13:38.000]  Here we were cheering on delivering one side and not the other.
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:39.240]  They were doctors.
[3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:41.640]  They were having success with their patients.
[3:13:41.640 --> 3:13:43.840]  Doctors are supposed to be storytellers.
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:44.840]  So start at the beginning.
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:45.840]  This is amazing.
[3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:46.840]  So you're breaking point.
[3:13:46.840 --> 3:13:49.440]  Then we'll go back into the stuff that led to that, but the breaking point, the medical
[3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:50.440]  information.
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:13:55.160]  That was the breaking point for me, especially with my personal doctor in California.
[3:13:55.160 --> 3:14:01.240]  When I had a personal Zoom appointment with him, I just asked him, frankly, how have you
[3:14:01.240 --> 3:14:05.440]  been approaching COVID-19 and he's like, oh, hydroxychloroquine.
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:08.800]  I was like, wow, and you're not getting pushback from that.
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:14.080]  And he's like, no, I've used it for so long and for different things, and my patients
[3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:15.600]  are better the next day.
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:19.960]  And so this is my own personal experience with my own personal doctor who is saying that
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:20.960]  he was using it.
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:25.800]  And so the fact that it was being just shut down and doctors were not allowed to talk about
[3:14:25.800 --> 3:14:26.800]  it.
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:31.840]  And then you see, months later, the redemption of the fact that the Lanza article, the New
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:35.280]  England Journal of Medicine, all had to do retractions.
[3:14:35.280 --> 3:14:41.280]  The Facebook Oversight Board Committee had to do a retraction on this drug, that other
[3:14:41.280 --> 3:14:45.440]  journalists were cheering on, like, no, that's misinformation.
[3:14:45.440 --> 3:14:50.240]  And so that is what's frustrating is we're not supposed to be taking a position.
[3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:54.240]  How about we just deliver what these doctors are saying, some other doctors disagree with
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:14:55.240]  it?
[3:14:55.240 --> 3:14:56.240]  And the doctors were, you wasn't the only one.
[3:14:56.240 --> 3:14:57.760]  The majority, we probably had 50 of them on.
[3:14:57.760 --> 3:15:03.280]  I mean, heads of hospitals are like, this is 100% or inhalable steroids, 100% with an
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:04.560]  hour is better.
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:07.520]  And they told them, don't innovate them, it kills them with COVID.
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:08.520]  So they innovate.
[3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:10.720]  And I mean, this is evil.
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:16.080]  And so I guess what I also find relatable is the fact that these doctors, some are just
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:17.320]  too afraid to speak.
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:22.760]  I've been afraid to speak up too much because I'm throwing away, essentially, a career that
[3:15:22.760 --> 3:15:25.760]  I've been passionate about and worked so hard to get to this point.
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:26.760]  Let's talk about your courage.
[3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:27.760]  This is true.
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:28.760]  Before you came on today, it was your idea.
[3:15:28.760 --> 3:15:31.680]  You said, you know, I'm taking the plunge here, they'll never hire me in the system
[3:15:31.680 --> 3:15:32.680]  again.
[3:15:32.680 --> 3:15:33.680]  But you said, I want to do it, let's do it.
[3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:37.360]  I didn't push you to do it, but doesn't it feel good to be getting this out now?
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:38.680]  I mean, it feels good to be honest.
[3:15:38.680 --> 3:15:43.000]  I'm just telling my story and being authentic, which I think is what you want from your list
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:47.560]  is off and someone that's being authentic, someone that's being honest and they tried
[3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:52.440]  to suppress you with a medical doctor who was your doctor, telling people he had a great
[3:15:52.440 --> 3:15:56.760]  response with hydroxychloroquine, and they were trying to hide the therapeutics so they
[3:15:56.760 --> 3:16:01.120]  could do an unauthorized experimental drug called a vaccine.
[3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:05.120]  They couldn't say there were any real therapeutics or they couldn't get emergency authorization.
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:07.080]  This is big pharma raping us.
[3:16:07.080 --> 3:16:12.800]  Well, over the past year, aside from that, in general, I was, my co-anchor and I were
[3:16:12.800 --> 3:16:15.840]  like-minded in the sense of just journalistic integrity.
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:21.000]  We were working overtime to just take out all of these adjectives, there were so many
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  adjectives.
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:28.440]  For example, one case was, and these are stories that would come down from national news, being
[3:16:28.440 --> 3:16:32.440]  from local news, I think that's your best shot at getting some fair, honest and local
[3:16:32.440 --> 3:16:37.000]  reporting, but we do still get information that comes down from national.
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:43.520]  One thing that we saw with that, for example, is President Trump falsely claims without
[3:16:43.520 --> 3:16:46.640]  evidence that there was election interference.
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:56.360]  Now we have three qualifiers, all in one sentence, falsely claims and without evidence to qualify
[3:16:56.360 --> 3:16:57.360]  this statement.
[3:16:57.360 --> 3:16:59.920]  But they weren't giving you evidence he was false.
[3:16:59.920 --> 3:17:05.000]  Well, just beyond that, the proper way to do this would have been President Trump says
[3:17:05.000 --> 3:17:07.400]  there was election interference.
[3:17:07.400 --> 3:17:12.440]  Democrats and election officials disagree and say there was none, period.
[3:17:12.440 --> 3:17:13.440]  That would be reporting.
[3:17:13.440 --> 3:17:16.600]  That would be the appropriate journalism I was taught.
[3:17:16.600 --> 3:17:22.880]  We were told in school, avoid using the word claims or refutes or things like that.
[3:17:22.880 --> 3:17:27.520]  You're like, say says as much as you need to because says doesn't have any undertone.
[3:17:27.520 --> 3:17:30.040]  Well, not this past year, everything was claimed.
[3:17:30.040 --> 3:17:33.160]  So you were trying to not have bias in this report, it was a controversy.
[3:17:33.160 --> 3:17:34.160]  He's challenging.
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:35.160]  They say he's wrong.
[3:17:35.160 --> 3:17:36.160]  That's real reporting.
[3:17:36.160 --> 3:17:37.640]  But instead, it was he's full of crap.
[3:17:37.640 --> 3:17:41.360]  You've now been turned into an engine that's just supposed to repeat what you're told.
[3:17:41.360 --> 3:17:42.360]  Right.
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:44.440]  And so I was just feeling very uncomfortable.
[3:17:44.440 --> 3:17:49.000]  There was obviously so much division, so much hardship that everyone felt over the past
[3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  year.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:53.520]  There was so much implicit in it and obviously don't want to feel like that.
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:55.920]  I don't want to feel like a propaganda puppet.
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:17:59.200]  If you study what propaganda is, it's easy to spot.
[3:17:59.200 --> 3:18:05.920]  And so I want to empower now my hope is to empower audiences to spot propaganda.
[3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:10.160]  Know what real journalism is supposed to be so that when you see the fake stuff, you'll
[3:18:10.160 --> 3:18:14.920]  be able to spot it and know it, that you're being gaslit or you're getting propaganda.
[3:18:14.920 --> 3:18:18.720]  Well, I'm just excited to know that you were telling me you're about to start your own
[3:18:18.720 --> 3:18:21.000]  podcast that launched a bunch of stuff.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:23.880]  And I just can't wait to see what you're doing because you're smart, you're dynamic, and
[3:18:23.880 --> 3:18:28.120]  we need more people that have been in mainstream media now that it's gone completely corrupt.
[3:18:28.120 --> 3:18:33.200]  So I just say start your own thing and I predict it's going to get big.
[3:18:33.200 --> 3:18:35.160]  Well, thank you for that bit of confidence.
[3:18:35.160 --> 3:18:37.920]  But more than that, I'm going to feel better about it.
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:38.920]  I'm not just...
[3:18:38.920 --> 3:18:39.920]  We got to go to break.
[3:18:39.920 --> 3:18:42.920]  I want to come back and talk about the other colleagues cheering on the censorship when
[3:18:42.920 --> 3:18:43.920]  we come back.
[3:18:43.920 --> 3:18:44.920]  Got it.
[3:18:44.920 --> 3:18:52.280]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:18:52.280 --> 3:18:58.120]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:18:58.120 --> 3:18:59.720]  and for word of mouth.
[3:18:59.720 --> 3:19:03.880]  And then we're all this together and it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:06.520]  got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:19:06.520 --> 3:19:07.520]  But it's true.
[3:19:07.520 --> 3:19:11.240]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:19:11.240 --> 3:19:13.320]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:15.880]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:18.520]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here.
[3:19:18.520 --> 3:19:23.040]  And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:19:23.040 --> 3:19:24.520]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:19:24.520 --> 3:19:26.680]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:31.080]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[3:19:31.080 --> 3:19:35.000]  You can't have info wars has been proven right being on air with all the craziness that's
[3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  about to unfold.
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:38.320]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:19:38.320 --> 3:19:43.280]  So thank you all and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplement
[3:19:43.280 --> 3:19:44.280]  and so much more.
[3:19:44.280 --> 3:19:46.280]  They're wonderful products and they support the infowar.
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:47.280]  Thank you.
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:53.920]  I'm giving you a status report on what your support of info wars has done.
[3:19:53.920 --> 3:19:58.040]  We are kicking globalist ass up and down the planet right now.
[3:19:58.040 --> 3:20:02.560]  Their entire agenda of depopulation, poison vaccines, it's all coming out.
[3:20:02.560 --> 3:20:05.320]  And yes, I'm risking my life and yes, this is very dangerous.
[3:20:05.320 --> 3:20:06.320]  But it's worth it.
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:07.320]  I'm very honored to be in the fight.
[3:20:07.320 --> 3:20:11.680]  So thanks for keeping me in the fight and our great crew here at info wars.
[3:20:11.680 --> 3:20:16.200]  And here's the other good news, this has been sold out for seven months.

[3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:08.400]  These are all incredible products.
[3:21:08.400 --> 3:21:12.040]  I can talk about each one for several minutes, but a lot of you have already used them, some
[3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:13.840]  of you haven't, you've got to go check these out.
[3:21:13.840 --> 3:21:18.880]  These are all top of the line formulas, some of them clones of bestsellers, others original
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:23.800]  formulations that we came up with, with top developers to blow people away and it's all
[3:21:23.800 --> 3:21:24.800]  there.
[3:21:24.800 --> 3:21:29.120]  There's a bunch of other big specials on water filtration, air filtration, too many sales
[3:21:29.120 --> 3:21:34.240]  and specials to mention them all here today, but whatever you do, go to infowarstore.com
[3:21:34.240 --> 3:21:39.120]  with a store free shipping and double patriot points and sold out for seven months DNA Force
[3:21:39.120 --> 3:21:47.920]  Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 that's been sold out is now back in stock 40% off infowarstore.com.
[3:21:47.920 --> 3:21:51.200]  When I get up here and tell you that most of our bestselling products have been sold out
[3:21:51.200 --> 3:21:55.120]  for three months, four months, six months, seven months, it's not a gimmick to make you
[3:21:55.120 --> 3:21:56.120]  buy the products.
[3:21:56.120 --> 3:22:00.760]  I'm really genuinely freaked out because listeners were buying enough of our great supplements
[3:22:00.760 --> 3:22:04.560]  and books and films and t-shirts to fund the operation, because they're great products
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:07.400]  that we're coming back and getting more and saying it for the sport.
[3:22:07.400 --> 3:22:12.440]  But whether it's DNA Force Plus or whether it's pollen block or whether it's supermobiality
[3:22:12.440 --> 3:22:18.040]  or vasobites, because of the ongoing lockdowns around the world, we're not going to lower
[3:22:18.040 --> 3:22:21.320]  the quality of our products and so we just can't offer them.
[3:22:21.320 --> 3:22:26.400]  But thank God it looks like some good things are starting to happen right now because suddenly
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:29.400]  a lot of products that have been sold out for a long time are back in stock.
[3:22:29.400 --> 3:22:31.280]  And one of them is pollen block.
[3:22:31.280 --> 3:22:35.720]  It takes a long time to get into pollen block, but it's for seasonal discomfort, stuff like
[3:22:35.720 --> 3:22:41.680]  allergies, it's from France, it's a special proprietary system, this is the highest quality
[3:22:41.680 --> 3:22:46.280]  back in stock infowarstore.com, store-wide free shipping and double-patriot points,
[3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:50.960]  check it out.
[3:22:50.960 --> 3:23:03.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:18.560]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:23:18.560 --> 3:23:25.800]  We've got Christy Lee here, ChristyLeeTV.com, and this is her whistleblowing about experiencing
[3:23:25.800 --> 3:23:30.320]  working in the Midwest, working in California, other areas, just the change in journalism.
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:34.920]  But we know the national pundits like Chris Matthews back in time or them would have their
[3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:38.280]  views or Rachel Maddow or even Tucker Carlson.
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:40.880]  And Tucker Carlson was always honest about that.
[3:23:40.880 --> 3:23:47.480]  Now it's all just, the local news is the most anti-American, anti-family, anti-gun, pro-abortion
[3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:52.560]  on and on and on, and so you're spilling your guts here, it's very interesting.
[3:23:52.560 --> 3:23:57.440]  Get into what you were telling me about the colleagues sharing the censorship of the truth
[3:23:57.440 --> 3:24:01.960]  about treatments for COVID-19 and just all those other amazing stories of what was happening
[3:24:01.960 --> 3:24:04.560]  behind the scenes and how the left was bullying people.
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:10.120]  Well, I was just shocked, really, that was the turning point for me when I spoke out
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:13.280]  against like, wait, why are these doctors being censored?
[3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:15.320]  Why are they being taken off of Facebook?
[3:24:15.320 --> 3:24:21.040]  Why are they being mocked by what are supposed to be impartial journalists just delivering
[3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:22.040]  information?
[3:24:22.040 --> 3:24:26.120]  I think that's the key here, is that we now have a new definition of journalism that some
[3:24:26.120 --> 3:24:28.200]  of my colleagues are following.
[3:24:28.200 --> 3:24:33.080]  It's this position of authority that we get to be the gateway to truth and we get to define
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:34.520]  it for you, our audience.
[3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:37.080]  Well, that's not the journalism that I learned.
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:40.880]  The journalism I learned is that we're just simply delivering information, we're supposed
[3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:44.080]  to be doing it from both sides, and we're not the gateway of truth.
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:47.840]  We respect our audience enough to let them decide what the truth is.
[3:24:47.840 --> 3:24:52.680]  So that is the frustrating thing that was for me over this past year is just dealing
[3:24:52.680 --> 3:24:57.000]  with especially this new crop of journalists that just have a different definition of what
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:58.200]  it's supposed to be.
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:25:03.600]  They call it advocacy journalism, which really just means activism journalism, and we're
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:05.640]  not supposed to be taking a position.
[3:25:05.640 --> 3:25:10.680]  If you're supposed to be being a true journalist, respect your audience, give them all the information,
[3:25:10.680 --> 3:25:14.480]  let them evaluate the information, and decide the truth for themselves.
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:20.560]  What's funny is actually, there's a quote from 2014, it says, we have to uphold a free
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:25.400]  press and a freedom of speech because in the end, lies and misinformation are no match
[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:26.400]  for the truth.
[3:25:26.400 --> 3:25:27.400]  Who do you think said that?
[3:25:27.400 --> 3:25:28.400]  Obama.
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:29.720]  Barack Obama said that.
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:33.200]  Do you think that he would still feel that way?
[3:25:33.200 --> 3:25:39.280]  No, and what he meant was we're in charge, we're in control, we dominate, so he was calling
[3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:40.880]  his lies the truth.
[3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:44.560]  How many of you supported journalism when in truth he waged war on journalists more
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:46.360]  than any president such as Lincoln?
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:52.480]  Absolutely, and that's the thing is like President Trump, I know that he is not liked by a lot
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:58.240]  of journalists because he has perpetuated this concept of fake news and been insulting,
[3:25:58.240 --> 3:26:03.080]  but when you really, truly look at the presidents and what they've done, Barack Obama was the
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:07.400]  one that truly attacked it with the espionage act and everything like that.
[3:26:07.400 --> 3:26:11.320]  But when you read a quote like that, when you have that pale end of that quote saying
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:17.080]  misinformation and lies are no match for the truth, well then, I take it to mean, well
[3:26:17.080 --> 3:26:21.520]  then you allow different points of view out there and if the misinformation and lies are
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:23.800]  no match for the truth, then it won't be.
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:30.200]  But when you try and censor information in the interest of calling it misinformation,
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:35.800]  well then you only perpetuate the questioning of, well, why is this being censored?
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:39.400]  Tell us some of those stories you told me, I mean, they're amazing.
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:45.480]  Well, I mean, for one, I thankfully worked with a like-minded co-anchor as far as just
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:50.480]  wanting to do journalism with integrity, to take out all the unnecessary adjectives, to
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:55.960]  deliver both sides, to not have selective sources, but all sources, and we almost were working
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:00.720]  over time as these stories came down from national with all of these adjectives thrown
[3:27:00.720 --> 3:27:05.040]  in, a position taken, and we were just trying to neutralize it, not take a position but
[3:27:05.040 --> 3:27:06.200]  neutralize it.
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:11.520]  And day-to-day, as an evening news team you would expect to do, we would be just be talking
[3:27:11.520 --> 3:27:17.800]  about the latest developments, particularly in the Trump lawsuits, et cetera, and we would
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:20.080]  just be on a day-to-day updating.
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:25.480]  And apparently, you know, someone had reported the evening news team for talking too much
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:28.480]  about politics in the newsroom, and we were just shocked.
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:31.280]  It's like, I'm reporting you for swimming in the swimming pool.
[3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:36.160]  I'm like, we simply can't not talk about politics in the newsroom, we're an evening
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:37.160]  news team.
[3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:38.160]  Well, that shows the left.
[3:27:38.160 --> 3:27:41.880]  They want to silence everybody and then dump their bullies.
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:47.640]  So as far as where I'm at, I had been wrestling with this, I had not been feeling comfortable,
[3:27:47.640 --> 3:27:51.920]  it had just changed so shockingly and dramatically over the past year along with everything else
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:52.920]  going on.
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:58.000]  And I'd been praying to God, like, I don't know what to do, I love what I do, I'm passionate
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:02.920]  about journalism and telling people stories, but this just doesn't feel right anymore.
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:07.920]  And God answered me in the most interesting and unlikely way.
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:12.840]  I got laid off after just a year, I got a call, and they said, we're laying off hundreds
[3:28:12.840 --> 3:28:16.840]  of people across the country because of the pandemic, and you're one of them.
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:20.720]  Made sense, I had only been in California one year at that point, so it was the newest
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:24.440]  hire and being an evening anchor, I'm assuming one of the hire paid.
[3:28:24.440 --> 3:28:30.480]  So nothing I took personally, but God made that decision for me, I've been at that crossroads
[3:28:30.480 --> 3:28:36.320]  and soul searching for the past couple of months, and I just decided I can't do journalism
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:42.320]  like that anymore, I have to do it in a way that I can feel good about and have honesty
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:47.680]  and integrity and the former foundational definition of journalism.
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:51.120]  Well, I mean, your story is amazing, and I've read over your notes, you told me some of
[3:28:51.120 --> 3:28:52.120]  the other stories.
[3:28:52.120 --> 3:28:57.400]  And then back to them celebrating censorship, you were saying, celebrating the blocking
[3:28:57.400 --> 3:29:05.000]  of admititures for COVID-19, miraculous stuff, that they failed suppressing it, but you witnessed
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:06.680]  it when they were trying to do this.
[3:29:06.680 --> 3:29:12.640]  Yeah, like I said, it was just very shocking and appalling to me, I was just shocked that
[3:29:12.640 --> 3:29:16.560]  there were journalists that I'd worked with in the past that were cheering the censorship
[3:29:16.560 --> 3:29:17.560]  on.
[3:29:17.560 --> 3:29:22.520]  Like, we're journalists, we're for the First Amendment, we're for freedom of the press,
[3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:27.440]  how can any true journalist be cheering this on?
[3:29:27.440 --> 3:29:31.200]  And what I think that we've seen is, for me, that was the turning point with the front
[3:29:31.200 --> 3:29:33.560]  line doctors, but we're seeing it more and more.
[3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:37.360]  The front line doctor situation ends up being validated, but that should never have been
[3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:42.840]  censored because the Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, the Facebook Oversight
[3:29:42.840 --> 3:29:45.400]  Board, they all had to retract and overturn.
[3:29:45.400 --> 3:29:48.720]  Just like they're having to retract that we were all wrong about the Wulan lab origin.
[3:29:48.720 --> 3:29:49.720]  Exactly.
[3:29:49.720 --> 3:29:54.920]  So we're just seeing more evidence of people having to eat humble pie because they took
[3:29:54.920 --> 3:29:55.920]  a position.
[3:29:55.920 --> 3:29:57.320]  You shouldn't have taken a position.
[3:29:57.320 --> 3:30:02.120]  You should have said, you could have said the majority of doctors are not.
[3:30:02.120 --> 3:30:06.840]  But that wasn't even true, the majority, I mean, that's the thing is, big techs merge
[3:30:06.840 --> 3:30:11.680]  with big pharma and they got a directive and they said, only the UN can say what you can
[3:30:11.680 --> 3:30:12.680]  do.
[3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:17.080]  I think the UN was put in charge of what doctors should say on Facebook.
[3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:23.880]  Well, I think that it also is a theme that I noticed this year is just the gross generalizations.
[3:30:23.880 --> 3:30:32.000]  You know, suddenly I was reading from a teleprompter, experts say, doctors say, health advisers
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  say, who are these?
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:36.520]  They said they're actually having, like, here's the very newsworthy, by the way, were you calling
[3:30:36.520 --> 3:30:37.520]  your doctor?
[3:30:37.520 --> 3:30:40.680]  Did you get back room research or maybe get him on there, like, here's my doctor, I trust
[3:30:40.680 --> 3:30:41.680]  him.
[3:30:41.680 --> 3:30:44.800]  I mean, that sounds like really good journalism is on the ground.
[3:30:44.800 --> 3:30:50.280]  But the thing is, since they've demonized it so much, even if I had asked my doctor who
[3:30:50.280 --> 3:30:55.800]  was using it and finding success, what doctor's going to want to go on and admit what they're
[3:30:55.800 --> 3:30:56.800]  doing anymore?
[3:30:56.800 --> 3:30:57.800]  Sure.
[3:30:57.800 --> 3:31:01.120]  Well, you're a journalist because you just go off what you see and then what's currently
[3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:04.320]  happening instead of punditry or analysis.
[3:31:04.320 --> 3:31:08.120]  But I think punditry analysis is great if you back it up.
[3:31:08.120 --> 3:31:09.120]  Exactly.
[3:31:09.120 --> 3:31:13.120]  Experts say, I'd say, here's the former chief scientist at Pfizer, he put out a giant report
[3:31:13.120 --> 3:31:17.360]  an emergency filing to the EU with the top scientist in the EU advisory board, warning
[3:31:17.360 --> 3:31:18.960]  of these unproven genetic therapies.
[3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:21.440]  And then I go, here's the document, it's posted here.
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:23.640]  People say, oh, Jones is, you know, fake news.
[3:31:23.640 --> 3:31:26.280]  I mean, I've just shown you what top scientists said.
[3:31:26.280 --> 3:31:29.320]  But see, they'll just say, oh, experts say it's all fine, no problem.
[3:31:29.320 --> 3:31:31.040]  Well, actually, the experts aren't saying that.
[3:31:31.040 --> 3:31:32.480]  Well, there's a word for that.
[3:31:32.480 --> 3:31:36.680]  It's called attribution, which used to be a tenant of journalism, naming your sources,
[3:31:36.680 --> 3:31:41.160]  being specific about it, but instead, all of a sudden, we have these gross generalizations.
[3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:43.840]  Experts say, health advisors say, well, that's where I've gotten in trouble because I've
[3:31:43.840 --> 3:31:45.840]  done a few things over the years that weren't accurate.
[3:31:45.840 --> 3:31:49.360]  And I was a pundit, but I was still held with highest standards where I covered what
[3:31:49.360 --> 3:31:53.440]  somebody else was saying, that the media cuts it down and says that I was officially saying
[3:31:53.440 --> 3:31:54.440]  that.
[3:31:54.440 --> 3:31:57.680]  But still, I've learned to not eat, you know, to be very clear about what I'm saying.
[3:31:57.680 --> 3:31:58.680]  Very specific.
[3:31:58.680 --> 3:32:03.080]  There's nothing wrong with being very specific about who your sources are, what the documents
[3:32:03.080 --> 3:32:04.080]  are.
[3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:08.640]  I mean, now that we're having this new age of journalism, it's just suddenly fine to
[3:32:08.640 --> 3:32:09.640]  just have you.
[3:32:09.640 --> 3:32:10.640]  Well, exactly.
[3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:13.040]  The left now says, oh, we're not going to show you any of our proof.
[3:32:13.040 --> 3:32:15.280]  They never have attribution hardly in articles now.
[3:32:15.280 --> 3:32:16.440]  We do that.
[3:32:16.440 --> 3:32:17.440]  And so that's what you're going to look for.
[3:32:17.440 --> 3:32:18.440]  Who's giving you attribution?
[3:32:18.440 --> 3:32:20.600]  Who's giving you sources and who isn't?
[3:32:20.600 --> 3:32:24.520]  I feel like what I'm saying is more of an arrogant approach to journalism, where they
[3:32:24.520 --> 3:32:28.400]  feel like they can have idealism over impartiality.
[3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:31.720]  I mean, that's the pushback I get when I'm trying to say that.
[3:32:31.720 --> 3:32:35.160]  At least stay there, I've just blown away about your story, and there's so much more
[3:32:35.160 --> 3:32:36.160]  to cover.
[3:32:36.160 --> 3:32:40.200]  Final segment, and then the war room with the one and only Owen Troyer, three to six
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:47.720]  p.m. right here on the Vaunted Dreaded Info Wars Network.

[3:33:19.080 --> 3:33:23.760]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[3:33:23.760 --> 3:33:24.760]  Yes.
[3:33:24.760 --> 3:33:31.240]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[3:33:31.240 --> 3:33:36.200]  perfect, sacredicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.

[3:34:01.400 --> 3:34:02.700]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:02.900 --> 3:34:04.580]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:04.580 --> 3:34:06.100]  It's the air power store hotline
[3:34:06.300 --> 3:34:07.700]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:07.800 --> 3:34:09.300]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:09.380 --> 3:34:11.000]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:11.080 --> 3:34:12.820]  It's the air power store hotline
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:14.300]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:14.400 --> 3:34:16.100]  Each seat in four store hotline
[3:34:16.220 --> 3:34:17.500]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:17.600 --> 3:34:19.020]  Each seat in four store hotline
[3:34:19.080 --> 3:34:20.700]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:22.360]  Each seat in four store hotline
[3:34:22.520 --> 3:34:24.000]  Triple eight two five three, thirty one, three nine
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:27.160]  Each seat in four store, if a war store dot come
[3:34:27.160 --> 3:34:55.160]  I've got some really good news for the viewers and listeners of this broadcast and then I've got some really, really, really, really, really good news.
[3:34:55.160 --> 3:35:03.160]  Yes, I can spend an hour telling you about how the Globals are getting exposed and how they launched COVID-19 as a bio weapon and how much trouble Bill Gates and Fauci are in.
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:10.160]  I can even tell you about how the states are turning against the puppet president Biden and saying we're going to have $1,000 fine to try to make people wear masks.
[3:35:10.160 --> 3:35:17.160]  I can tell you about all of that, but why shouldn't I instead tell you about the super good news concerning the info war?
[3:35:17.160 --> 3:35:33.160]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we are running right now, the Memorial Day special for the next week only with store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points and DNA Force Plus is back in stock, sold out for 7 months, 40% off,
[3:35:33.160 --> 3:35:47.160]  supermobile mentality, 50% off, Prostigard, 40% off, Apple Power, 50%, Ultra 1200%, Hazel, 50%, free shipping and papery of points and it comes in full war and it's incredible products and George Soros hates it.
[3:35:47.160 --> 3:36:05.160]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[3:36:05.160 --> 3:36:22.160]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[3:36:22.160 --> 3:36:42.160]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[3:36:42.160 --> 3:36:59.160]  This is the ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:34.160]  Our guest is a whistleblowing reporter. She worked in the Midwest, California and went to the awards AP. She saw the total transformation to regurgitating propaganda over and over and over again.
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:48.160]  Where do you expect all this to go now because it hasn't helped the mainstream media. It's actually made their ratings go down even more. I mean, if the propaganda before was a little more camouflaged, I think the overtness is going to backfire because I've never camouflaged that we're promoting freedom and America and everything.
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:56.160]  We make mistakes sometimes, but we mean well. We've changed history. These guys try to act like they don't have an agenda when they do have an agenda.
[3:37:56.160 --> 3:38:04.160]  Well, I mean, that's why I'm taking the leap of faith that I am knowing that it's not going to make me too many friends necessarily and could take me in a totally different direction.
[3:38:04.160 --> 3:38:20.160]  But I think that I've just thought about this long enough to see the writing on the wall. This industry can't survive like this. It can't continue to be trusted and people can't continue to want to tune into something that they can't trust.
[3:38:20.160 --> 3:38:30.160]  And it's just so glaringly obvious that there's journalists that are taking hard positions, not providing sources or selective sources.
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:49.160]  And so I just, I see the future of news, of TV news essentially just dying and I kind of, I'm at the point where I'm like, well, I know I'm taking a huge risk here, but I'm going to get out now because I think that ship is sinking if something big doesn't change.
[3:38:49.160 --> 3:38:57.160]  What do you, you've got so many stories from behind the scenes. What else do you want to impart to the audience about what's going on in these newsrooms?
[3:38:57.160 --> 3:39:04.160]  Because the system knows that national news isn't trusted anymore. So people do trust local news workers. They still think, oh, that's my local news.
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:11.160]  They don't know more and more of these packages are sent down that you just read off a teleprompter and put it to the video. So it's their words in your mouth.
[3:39:11.160 --> 3:39:20.160]  Well, that's what I hope that I can, the part I can play is taking viewers behind the curtain a little bit and understanding how news functions.
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:29.160]  Local news, I will still defend as your best shot at getting true honest journalism because these people live in the community.
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:41.160]  And, but the thing is, is for local news, you still get your packages and sources that you run in like the national news blocks or with the company or the corporation that owns the local news station.
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:56.160]  So what I'm again, what I'm hoping to do is take people behind the curtain also to identify a journalist you can trust against this new wave of journalism, which, like I said before, I was getting pushed back when I would have these debates of calling out like,
[3:39:56.160 --> 3:40:01.160]  hey, we're supposed to be before freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
[3:40:01.160 --> 3:40:13.160]  And when I would get the pushback, I would say, I would say, well, basically the pushback would be, well, but what about morals and these are my ideals and it doesn't matter.
[3:40:13.160 --> 3:40:20.160]  It doesn't matter what we think. You can't have idealism over integrity and impartiality and journalism. And that's what we're seeing.
[3:40:20.160 --> 3:40:29.160]  And that's how they're able to create all these montages where it'll show 20 different, 30 different newscasts all saying the exact same thing at the exact same time, like it's the board.
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:37.160]  And the thing is, if you're a good anchor, then you will change like your anchor intro or your anchor tag. You have control over that.
[3:40:37.160 --> 3:40:49.160]  And that's what I was doing this past year is I was changing at least my introduction or my tag to these stories to try and find and list the sources or take out these extra adjectives and just neutralize it.
[3:40:49.160 --> 3:40:57.160]  And then maybe you weren't let go just because of COVID. Maybe you were let go because you weren't put on the line.
[3:40:57.160 --> 3:41:13.160]  I don't think that that's the case. I honestly don't. But I mean, either way, I'm here. I think we're God wanted me to be. I couldn't be in that situation anymore, feeling a part of the division and anger that everybody and unrest and confusion that everyone was feeling over this past year.
[3:41:13.160 --> 3:41:19.160]  I didn't want to feel complicit in that anymore.
[3:41:19.160 --> 3:41:32.160]  Talking about colleagues that have been drinking the Kool-Aid of the wokeness. What is what is their mindset? Are they getting more extreme or what's because it seems like when you see leftist pundits and leftists online, they seem to be just getting crazier and crazier.
[3:41:32.160 --> 3:41:45.160]  I absolutely think that. I mean, I had strong relationships and thought why I was on the same page with people I've worked with in the past. And some of them I still am. I don't want to say it's like I'm against everyone.
[3:41:45.160 --> 3:41:59.160]  But the ones that have taken this more position of what I call arrogant journalism. I mean, there's so all in on it. You know, I'm willing to say it doesn't matter what I think as a journalist.
[3:41:59.160 --> 3:42:07.160]  How many other journalists are willing to say it doesn't matter what I think. That's how it should be. There's just supposed to be the person delivering the message.
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:15.160]  But they feel like they can take some moral high ground or have idealism lead what they're saying. And so then they've taken the position of authority.
[3:42:15.160 --> 3:42:30.160]  But really, they're just spewing corporate propaganda. I mean, the left acts like they're so low. And they're the mouthpiece for Apple that runs the worst death camps, literally their factories, the thing components from have the Uighurs in concentration camps.
[3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:36.160]  And you tell the left that they just laugh. They don't care. It's like, but then they'll say they have the moral high ground, though.
[3:42:36.160 --> 3:42:48.160]  Absolutely. But I think it comes down to respect. We as journalists are supposed to work for the people and for the community and be transparent and respect our audience.
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:57.160]  But have you thought, though, I mean, when you say going to probably do a podcast or a new show about being a reporter some of the time, but also being a pundit and giving your opinion?
[3:42:57.160 --> 3:43:05.160]  Because that's, I mean, that's what it all is anyways now. Instead of hiding it like they do, just absolutely just come out with your own views.
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:18.160]  I will say that God's in the driver's seat and I'm just pushing the pedal. So I don't know where he's going to steer me directly. The purpose I feel right now is exposing that news is threatening to become propaganda or is already.
[3:43:18.160 --> 3:43:25.160]  I don't want to be a propaganda puppet. I want to deconstruct news. I want to teach people to identify true news as opposed to propaganda.
[3:43:25.160 --> 3:43:38.160]  It's beautiful. And what you're saying is so true. If we all have integrity and don't support systems that lie to us and speak the truth and tell the truth, we'll build our own ecosystems like America was to a great extent, never perfect.
[3:43:38.160 --> 3:43:52.160]  It's when we all sell out and conform, then we think we're getting money to be part of the system and, you know, we're just compromising. You can't compromise because they never compromise with us. It's more, more, more, more, and then it destroys society.
[3:43:52.160 --> 3:44:04.160]  And as a journalist, I love words, right? And I think that we're also in a society standard right now where when we're having the intense arguments with each other and disagreeing, it's because we have different definitions of words.
[3:44:04.160 --> 3:44:19.160]  I think that from now on, when we have these discussions, you almost have to define the word before you can have the discussion. But that's what I want to do. I want to encourage discourse discussion, definitely not censorship and shutting ideas down.
[3:44:19.160 --> 3:44:28.160]  Here's a great report I think you ought to do once you start your show. Look at this. This is a screenshot from before April 2020 and the whole COVID global government takeover.
[3:44:28.160 --> 3:44:49.160]  Here's after April 2020. This is officially from Webstradictionary Online with the whole audio player, everything. And it says, definition of vaccine, a preparation of killed microorganisms, living, attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce an artificially increased immunity to a particular disease.
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:59.160]  That is learned immunity. That is vaccines for 500 years, going back to smallpox and the toothpick, you know, putting some of the cow pus into your arm so that when you, you know, get it later, you don't die.
[3:44:59.160 --> 3:45:10.160]  Here it is. After a preparation that is administered as by injection to stimulate the body's immune response against a specific infectious disease.
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:26.160]  It's not going to be anything. It's gene editing. An allergic preparation or a typically inactivated or attenuated C attenuated since two pathogenic agents such as bacterium or virus or one of its components or products such as a protein or toxin.
[3:45:26.160 --> 3:45:38.160]  A preparation of genetic material such as a strain of synthesized messenger. I mean, so this is not what you always do as a vaccine now. They're just playing word games and that's important.
[3:45:38.160 --> 3:45:49.160]  And I think that there's many other examples of that. And I think when they change the definition of words, it's also to handicap us from having the argument like, wait, no, that's not what it means anymore.
[3:45:49.160 --> 3:45:54.160]  You know, so then we can't have a true honest argument because we have two different definitions of words.
[3:45:54.160 --> 3:46:05.160]  Well, that's right. We now have the new head of the ATF about to be confirmed saying he calls all semi automatic assault rifles. So he wants a band. And that's all how they define things.
[3:46:05.160 --> 3:46:10.160]  It's happening with many other words and other topics.
[3:46:10.160 --> 3:46:16.160]  Well, listen, I'm really glad that when we, you know, we're talking to you and you were telling us the story off record that you came on air.
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:18.160]  I didn't even know that when you came to visit us, you were going to do that.
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:25.160]  So I'm glad that spontaneously you've done this and I hope you feel good about it and hope people appreciate what you've done because so many other people live in fear.
[3:46:25.160 --> 3:46:34.160]  But when you've done it will help others break out of fear and you've seen all these Facebook insiders and others coming out of they've been told a lie and told to go along with this and quote hide the truth.
[3:46:34.160 --> 3:46:40.160]  And so I think that's going to be the system's real problem is when doctors and real journalists and others just say this has gone too far.
[3:46:40.160 --> 3:46:44.160]  Well, I was raised with my father saying, feel the fear and do it anyway.
[3:46:44.160 --> 3:46:54.160]  So today I've felt the fear I did in any way and I stand on God's truth that God does not give us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self this one.
