[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War, and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:17.000 --> 00:37.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:37.000 --> 00:54.000]  North Carolina has produced many of the finest soldiers, airmen, sailors, and Marines the world has ever seen.
[00:54.000 --> 01:07.000]  These patriots have shed their blood to defend our country in distant fields of battle across the earth. Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.
[01:07.000 --> 01:31.000]  We love our flag, right? We love our flag, and we don't like it when we see people ripping up our flag and burning our flag. We don't like it.
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  And we'll see what we're going to do about that, okay?
[01:38.000 --> 01:49.000]  On healthcare reform, every day, the law known as Obamacare is destabilizing on healthcare, really destabilizing it.
[01:49.000 --> 01:59.000]  Surging premiums and forcing providers out of the market. If we don't act, the damage will be irreversible. We're going to act.
[01:59.000 --> 02:12.000]  That is why we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We have no choice. We have absolutely no choice.
[02:12.000 --> 02:33.000]  So we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and you're going to get healthcare at a much lower price with a much lower deductible.
[02:33.000 --> 02:44.000]  At a much lower price. On childcare, I'm asking Congress to pass legislation to make safe and affordable childcare accessible to all, and people like that.
[02:44.000 --> 02:55.000]  That's something that Ivanka Trump, did anybody ever hear of Ivanka Trump? Ivanka Trump has been fighting for for a long time, and I have, and I agree with that.
[02:55.000 --> 03:12.000]  On crime, the murder rate has experienced its largest increase in 45 years. We are going to support the incredible men and women of law enforcement, and we are going to bring this terrible crime wave to an end.
[03:12.000 --> 03:26.000]  The highest in 45 years to murder. Ethics reform will be a crucial part of our 100 day plan as well. We're going to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington DC.
[03:26.000 --> 03:54.000]  I will impose a five year ban on executive branch officials becoming lobbyists, and a lifetime ban on officials becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We face many, many challenges, but this is truly an exciting time to be alive in our country and hopefully to be alive in many other locations
[03:54.000 --> 04:06.000]  because we are representative to a large extent of what's happening in the world. The world is looking up to us, but they haven't been looking up to us much, and they are going to start looking up again.
[04:06.000 --> 04:24.000]  We're going to be good for the world, not just good for our country. The script for what we're doing is not yet written. Remember, this has been a great, great move. The likes of which they've never seen before.
[04:24.000 --> 04:41.000]  The likes of which those folks back there that write the stories. No, no, no, I'll tell you. And they're saying that they've never seen anything like this before. It's one of the great political phenomenons of all time.
[04:41.000 --> 04:54.000]  And we're going to show them we're going to do a great job. We're going to create a safe country. We're going to create a prosperous country. We're going to have jobs again, great jobs, not bad jobs, real jobs. And it's going to be something special.
[04:54.000 --> 05:15.000]  So hopefully they can write the truth.
[05:25.000 --> 05:43.000]  For example, CBS News just listed Infowars as a fake news website. And that's because the mainstream establishment media is losing all credibility with the American people. And it was alternative and social media who helped Donald Trump win the presidential election.
[05:43.000 --> 05:59.000]  So now the globalist battle plan is to indoctrinate the masses into only accepting the establishment viewpoint of what they want you to believe is real news. And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[06:13.000 --> 06:23.000]  They changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective. Well, you know what the next move's going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after you're done.
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  Oh, yeah.
[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  I think it ain't going to sit well down my way at all. It ain't going to sit well.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand paul reviewers.
[06:33.000 --> 06:42.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie. And beef was for supper.
[06:42.000 --> 06:52.000]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available, starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general Jerry Boykin.
[06:52.000 --> 06:59.000]  Want to shed some tears over the red, white and blue? Revelation, the movie.info. Let's fix it.
[06:59.000 --> 07:09.000]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the Infowar, a 360 win.
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at Infowars.com.
[07:15.000 --> 07:23.000]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[07:29.000 --> 07:35.000]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[07:35.000 --> 07:42.000]  Just go to Infowarsstore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.000]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at Infowarslife.com, this is a sure win.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  10% off on auto ship, win win win at Infowarslife.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[07:55.000 --> 08:21.000]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[08:21.000 --> 08:30.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  We were told it was coming. The evidence was there.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Members of the Federal Communications Commission said they wanted to censor talk radio and internet.
[08:38.000 --> 08:55.000]  And now it's been openly announced, actually shutting down Infowars.com and thousands of other prominent sites, not because we're fake, but because we expose the fake people.
[08:55.000 --> 09:08.000]  The current attack on free speech worldwide is so intense, so classically totalitarian, that quite frankly, I'm having trouble even believing it's this bad.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  They have been incrementally trying to erode free speech and the free press for a long time in Europe and the United States.
[09:14.000 --> 09:23.000]  In the last few years, we've seen Zuckerberg meet with the Communist Chinese censors and pledge to them and Merkel that they would bring censorship here to the United States.
[09:23.000 --> 09:31.000]  That drudge came here a year ago and warned us that he talked to a Supreme Court justice and others, and they were told censorship was coming in 2016.
[09:31.000 --> 09:45.000]  We've seen the internet handed over October 1st of this year to an international consortium headed up by the United Nations with countries like Saudi Arabia on the board deciding what can be on the web and what can't.
[09:45.000 --> 10:03.000]  Now, the European Union Commission, unelected, came out and gave Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other tech giants 24 hours to censor a list of, quote, fake news that they've issued, that Infowars.com is on, that DrudgeReport.com is on, that Breitbart.com is on.
[10:03.000 --> 10:11.000]  And they mixed it with stuff like the onion. This is outrageous. You have to sue someone to prove something's a fraud and then shut them down via damages.
[10:11.000 --> 10:19.000]  You can't, in a free society like the Communist Chinese do, say something's fake news because it criticizes the Central Committee and just arrest people.
[10:19.000 --> 10:29.000]  But I'm here to tell you, they've bitten off more than they could chew, in my view. We saw mainstream media further discredit itself with fake polls lying.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  They got caught coordinating themselves with the White House, with Hillary. It's truly disgusting.
[10:35.000 --> 10:50.000]  And now, we've seen the Washington Post, New York Times, you name it, come out, Politico, and say, time to censor Donald Trump, the President of the United States, for his Twitter saying it's bullying that he calls people liars and scumbags.
[10:50.000 --> 11:01.000]  That's his right to do. That's his view. They're allowed to call him every name under the sun. They're allowed in the New York Times and LA Times and Newsweek to call for his assassination, which is illegal.
[11:01.000 --> 11:12.000]  But oh my gosh, he called somebody fat or he did that. This is how they plan to bring in the political correctness where only nationalists and patriots and conservatives and veterans are censored.
[11:12.000 --> 11:22.000]  And Twitter responded saying, we're actually going to look at banning the President. But then it gets worse. They're attacking us on CBS News, ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, every hour.
[11:22.000 --> 11:36.000]  I mean, it's so bad, it's good, because they're dwindling audiences, early going to come to infowars.com. And our numbers are just continuing to rise, dwarfing CNN, dwarfing the New York Times online, according to Quantcast and other services.
[11:36.000 --> 11:48.000]  But now, self-proclaimed hack in the WikiLeaks, telling Hillary and the Democrats, I'm a hack. I'll lie. I'll do whatever. You just tell me to say whatever you want and I'll say it.
[11:48.000 --> 11:59.000]  Talk about fake news who thinks you're stupid. Self-proclaimed hack and political writer, Glenn Thrush, participated in MSNBC discussion where they say it's time to censor the media.
[11:59.000 --> 12:08.000]  It's time to ban discussions of pedophile networks, alleged networks, you name it. And it's time to shut down infowars and Alex Jones.
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.000]  They're really on TV because we've kicked their butts and proven they're the fake news saying censor us.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, if they can censor us, they can censor everybody.
[12:18.000 --> 12:27.000]  Now, to Matt Taibbi's credit at Rolling Stone and journalists at the Letting Guardians credit, they've come out and said, this black list is incredibly dangerous.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  It makes McCarthy look like an angel. What in the hell are you doing? Stop it now.
[12:32.000 --> 12:38.000]  But the decrying of this tyranny is not strong enough from the left, so it may just be good cop, bad cop.
[12:38.000 --> 12:47.000]  But regardless, throw me in that briar patch any day. You want to just come out and say I'm fake news when we have a record of being way more accurate than you are?
[12:47.000 --> 12:59.000]  We're not getting orders from big corporations. We're self-funded. You aren't just butthurt that you work for big corrupt global corporations that are constantly starting wars and race-baiting.
[12:59.000 --> 13:07.000]  You're just butthurt that you're just hacks in your own words, mercenaries that read off teleprompters and aren't your own man, your own woman.
[13:07.000 --> 13:17.000]  You're just so pissed that Info Wars dwarfs, 10 or 15 of your biggest organizations together, including the New York Times, and that we're a small operation that's grassroots and gaining steam.
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  You're scared. You hate the fact you're not your own person, and you have zero integrity.
[13:23.000 --> 13:30.000]  So go ahead and try to ban us. Go ahead and have Google on Chrome de-list us. Go ahead and have Quantcast take us off.
[13:30.000 --> 13:39.000]  Go ahead and try to imagine we're not there, and it'll only make people flock to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and our other sites that much faster.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  But I've always done this. When government-connected hackers brought down Info Wars a decade ago, I launched Prison Planet.
[13:45.000 --> 13:54.000]  When they tried to shut down my radio show, I launched The Nightly News. When they physically attacked me and at all sorts of other garbage, I launched a larger network.
[13:54.000 --> 14:03.000]  So following in our past formula of liberty, we're only going to expand Info Wars that much more now in the face of your attempts.
[14:03.000 --> 14:16.000]  And we've never seen such support with listeners spreading our articles and our videos and buying the products at infowarstore.com in response to what you're doing, because they understand we are on target.
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.000]  In conclusion, I leave you with a historical parallel from the Second Great War, World War II.
[14:22.000 --> 14:29.000]  And it was a saying that fighter bomber crews and pilots used. You know you're over the target when you're getting the flak.
[14:29.000 --> 14:38.000]  They didn't have radar early in the war. Their maps weren't very good. They'd get off course, but they knew to go towards the flak.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  They knew to go towards the flames and the burning buildings. They knew to go to where the smoke was and where the fight was happening.
[14:45.000 --> 14:57.000]  Those big anti-aircraft guns would be firing up thousands of feet into the air and they would turn those bombers in and fly right in over the targets and drop their bombs on those Nazi factories.
[14:57.000 --> 15:10.000]  And so I leave you with that. We are over the target and Info Wars is getting more attacks now some days than even the head strategist for the White House, Stephen Bannon, and sometimes even more than Trump himself.
[15:10.000 --> 15:22.000]  It is epic because they're so scared of the spirit of Info Wars. The reawakening of our republic and the fact that the military, the police, foreign governments, and huge populations listen to us.
[15:22.000 --> 15:32.000]  And they can look at how we're rising exponentially. So they're pulling the incredibly dangerous move of openly now trying to physically shut us down.
[15:32.000 --> 15:41.000]  Wow. I never knew growing up right here in Texas that I'd be at this level fighting tyranny. I just started a local radio show when I was 21 to promote the Second Amendment.
[15:41.000 --> 15:54.000]  But I guess, you know, as they've said many times, great times make the person and all of us are being forced to really take action and do incredible things because we live in amazing times.
[15:54.000 --> 16:12.000]  The circumstances are just so incredible. That's why I always end by saying, you're the hope. You're the answer. If you are watching this transmission, if you're listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[16:12.000 --> 16:28.000]  In this special report, we are looking at what Info Wars has dubbed the Trump effect. He's only been president-elect for a month. It's 43 days until he's finally in office, January 20th, and already carrier is staying in Indiana.
[16:28.000 --> 16:44.000]  Multiple Ford plants are now not going to Mexico, but staying here. And the head of Ford says, if Trump cuts corporate taxes, they'll move everything back to the United States. And now Apple's talking about bringing its iPhone plants back to the United States.
[16:44.000 --> 16:55.000]  But there's more. That's right, ladies and gentlemen, $50 billion is now being announced to be invested in high tech in the United States by the Japanese.
[16:55.000 --> 17:08.000]  Chief Executive and Chairman of the Soft Bank Group, Masayoshi Sun, has pledged to invest at least $100 billion in the United States now that Donald Trump has been elected.
[17:08.000 --> 17:18.000]  It's estimated that the deal, if it goes through, will create at least 50,000 new jobs in the United States only in the first year.
[17:18.000 --> 17:33.000]  Mr. Sun, the head of one of the most powerful Japanese corporate conglomerates, visited Trump Tower today and told reporters they had made the decision now that the United States had different leadership that was basically towards growth.
[17:33.000 --> 17:49.000]  But even the Wall Street Journal had little snide remarks like, Mr. Trump claims responsibility for the announcement that Mr. Sun is making when Mr. Sun made the announcement from Trump Tower and gave Trump credit.
[17:49.000 --> 18:01.000]  Mr. Sun also has a history of going straight to national leaders to talk business. In September, he met with South Korean president and pledged to invest $4.5 billion in the country's technology sector.
[18:01.000 --> 18:11.000]  He's over list of the super high tech jobs that he's pledging to bring of the United States, reversing the flow of high technology jobs out of the nation.
[18:11.000 --> 18:22.000]  The $50 billion comes from the overall $100 billion fund. Mr. Sun plans to spend heavily in fields, including the so-called Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and robotics.
[18:22.000 --> 18:35.000]  He has said he wants to become the Warren Buffett of the tech industry. Want to make this clear? Half of the biggest Japanese investment fund is now coming to the United States, the other half, other parts of the world.
[18:35.000 --> 18:50.000]  Talk about delivering. And under Obama, he made the decision to bring zero here. And why is Mr. Sun announcing the $50 billion investment that will hire at least 50,000 people in the first year in robotics and other technology?
[18:50.000 --> 18:59.000]  Because suddenly, we're going to have cheaper power prices because Trump's can allow our power plants to be turned back on. We're not going to have regulations that harass businesses.
[18:59.000 --> 19:13.000]  But most importantly, if you look at China, they have a corporate income tax that is way lower than the United States. And as soon as that's equal, then it will make sense to come back to the United States of America.
[19:13.000 --> 19:30.000]  Those are two special reports that we worked till 3 a.m. to put out last night, along with several other reports. Quite frankly, I'm working even harder now with the crew than I was before the election because the true battle is now being joined.
[19:30.000 --> 19:51.000]  Notice Trump's pointing out that the new Air Force One should cost $2 billion, not $4 billion, and it's a big ripoff. And his move to cancel it is only going to illustrate that Boeing, a quintessential American company from Washington State, has basically moved to China and that they need to move back and watch.
[19:51.000 --> 20:02.000]  I predict within two years, Boeing will begin to cancel construction of new factories in China and move most of its operations back to the USA.
[20:02.000 --> 20:18.000]  That's what's happening here, ladies and gentlemen. And as soon as that corporate income tax gets cut by 15% to match China, that Trump wants to go to 20% five below China, it is going to be a giant sucking sound back into the United States.
[20:18.000 --> 20:31.000]  Now, that'll just restore balance. China, again, the US has lost 80% of its industrial capacity since the 1970s. That's a conservative number. Some estimates are as much as 85. But 80% is gone.
[20:31.000 --> 20:42.000]  If Trump can get 20% of that back, it's a devastating victory for this country and for the average person. And plus the Chinese generals that own and run that country, they don't give anything to the workers.
[20:42.000 --> 20:52.000]  It's not like we're building up China. We're building up the elites there to come in and buy up US assets. So he's playing Japan off against China. He's made all the right signals.
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  The minute he stood up to China and signaled that he would boom, here comes one of the top guys that runs Japan.
[20:59.000 --> 21:17.000]  Those people had, I mean, the soft bank group, tens of trillions. I mean, they run the show in Japan and much of the world and they go, oh, 50 billion, boom, next year, 50,000 jobs, boom, super high tech development above NASA stuff coming to the United States of America.
[21:17.000 --> 21:29.000]  And they're going to hire. What do the Japanese do? Unlike I'm not bashing the Koreans with the Koreans, you know, basically hire their own people at their plants or in the US predominantly in all the mid-level, high-level, not Japan. They bring in Americans.
[21:29.000 --> 21:41.000]  So this is a very, very exciting situation taking place. And it shows that the globalist had it out to get this country. All Trump's got to do is take the federal government's boot off of our neck.
[21:41.000 --> 21:51.000]  Now, I have some big fake news announcements here for you about fake news. Roger Stone's joining us in the next segment to talk about it from Trump Tower.
[21:51.000 --> 22:05.000]  I should add, boy, if I'm just going to stop right there, he's got a lot to talk about. He's not been doing a lot of interviews lately because he's writing his big definitive book on the election and what transpired.
[22:05.000 --> 22:20.000]  But I've never had the disgraced MSCM, CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC, all of them. New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, San Jose, Mercury News. I mean, you name it, I'm talking hundreds of day.
[22:20.000 --> 22:32.000]  National public radio is attacking me morning, noon and night. Everybody I know has family calling them that know me and are saying, this is incredible. We've never heard this on NPR.
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  They attack Alex Jones more than Trump now. And I'm going to explain why they're doing this now.
[22:38.000 --> 22:50.000]  I decide getting in the car this morning. I keep hearing NPRs attacking me on the hour. I turn it on. I never really listened to NPR except maybe once a month to monitor things or in some areas of the country that's only talk radio.
[22:50.000 --> 23:05.000]  There is. So I listened to it maybe once a month or so. And it was Tom Ashbrook on points, the name of the show. And I tune in and this is what I hear. In fact, I've got a recording of some of it that was done over the iPhone.
[23:05.000 --> 23:17.000]  So it's too scratchy. But this is what I hear. Alex Jones is incredibly convincing and it can be slicker or as slick as CNN or NPR. And he's very dangerous.
[23:17.000 --> 23:29.000]  He's convincing people, listen to this outrageous lie. And I'm like, the Clintons have left a trail of death behind them and assassinations. People have their arms and legs cut off and it's been ruled suicide.
[23:29.000 --> 23:40.000]  That's been in the Arkansas papers. That's been in national news. That's been in major publications across the country for 20 plus years.
[23:40.000 --> 23:48.000]  They think their audience is stupid and don't know about, I came, I saw he died. She overthrew Libya. She destabilized it, brought in radical Muslims.
[23:48.000 --> 23:55.000]  Over 60,000 have died. I mean, did she lie about getting shot at in Serbia on the tarmac and like Brian Williams? Yes.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  Is there always other suspicious deaths around the Clintons? Yes. Do they launch all these wars? Yes.
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  You know, do guys in the DNC that leaked stuff to WikiLeaks get shot four times in the back and the guy's mother saying he was the leaker and he was killed? Yes.
[24:09.000 --> 24:17.000]  They said election fraud doesn't exist. Then came out and said election fraud totally exists. Trump works for the Russians is going to steal the election.
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  Hillary, so the Russians are going to steal the election. Alex Jones works for the Russians. That all fails. They give you fake polls.
[24:24.000 --> 24:32.000]  They're caught in the WikiLeaks from Comedy Central to CNN, ABC News to CBS, scripting everything through Hillary and the White House and George Soros.
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.000]  Three groups are in those tens of thousands of emails, excuse me, hundreds of thousands. Three groups, Soros, through media matters.
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.000]  And then, you know, to the emails, do what they say. They're there with Soros in the White House, the White House and Hillary.
[24:46.000 --> 24:53.000]  So there are hundreds on the death list. We're on that daily list of 33 spine tingling that are just absolutely, you know, open and shut.
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  I've interviewed people that had the state police come to their house. The guy that lived next door, Jennifer Flyer is going to get him back on.
[24:59.000 --> 25:14.000]  He was on like 20 years ago. These are the Clinton Chronicles. They broke his arms and legs in state police uniforms and said stop videotaping Clinton across the condo way, across the, you know, the stairs going into Jennifer Flyer's apartment.
[25:14.000 --> 25:25.000]  I'd interviewed the guy that the state police broke his arms and his legs at the elbows and at the knees, knocked his teeth out, almost killed him.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  By the way, that's who they had killed people was the state police. State police pull you over, they torture you, they kill you in Arkansas.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  That's well known of that secret service on about it. Not all the state police, but his, his handpicked goons.
[25:38.000 --> 25:47.000]  Oh no, Bill Clinton is not mafia. He didn't steal 94% of the money from Haiti. Billions. Oh no, he didn't fly on Jerry Epstein's plane with the pedophiles.
[25:47.000 --> 26:04.000]  Oh no, it's not in the FBI manuals that they call Child Pornography Cheese Pizza. But see how they lie. They go, Alex Jones created a whole fiction and about a lie about Podesta and sex and Satanism and blame some pizza place called Pink Comet Ping Pong and said some weird hallucination about pizza.
[26:04.000 --> 26:16.000]  We covered the WikiLeaks that had a code about pizzas in New York that's in the FBI file said I don't know what that is, but they say it's this. It can also be about drugs. It should be investigated. Everybody else covered it too.
[26:16.000 --> 26:29.000]  But that doesn't matter. Then they use linguistics and words to go, Oh, there's a pizza place listed here. Somebody mentioned it on Reddit. Let's say it's all about this one pizza place to only limit it to that one area and get all the focus there.
[26:29.000 --> 26:39.000]  Make them victims have some very questionable events where witnesses say no shots fired, but the news says there is and it's an admitted actor who's been in trouble with the law.
[26:39.000 --> 26:49.000]  I mean, the whole thing is classic scripting. I'm not saying it's scripted. It has all the telltale signs. They've been caught doing it before. They did all those fake videos with a campaign with Hillary with fake actors in them.
[26:49.000 --> 27:01.000]  This is what they do. They always say I said nobody died at Sandy Hook the whole thing's fake. I said that's what people said. All I know is Anderson Cooper CIA got caught in a blue slash green screen with his nose disappearing.
[27:01.000 --> 27:10.000]  They got caught doing fake satellite interviews where one's in New York, one's in Connecticut, and it's the same cars driving behind them. That's how dumb they think you are.
[27:10.000 --> 27:21.000]  I don't know how fake it is, but you're a pack of known liars. And your response is to give us the full broadside and I'll say this.
[27:21.000 --> 27:31.000]  CBS broadcast doesn't have 30 million viewers like they did 20 years ago, but it's still got four or five a night. That's still got an audience broadcast CBS.
[27:31.000 --> 27:37.000]  NPR taxpayer funded 450 million a year and then begs for money every day.
[27:37.000 --> 27:48.000]  Rockefeller Foundation funded all the usual Ford, Ford Carnegie, you name it. They have the biggest transmitters on FM radio in every major city of this country and they do have a big audience.
[27:48.000 --> 27:57.000]  NPR is the only liberal media that still has an audience. You know, I want to say it's got 50 million people a day. Listen, that's conservative.
[27:57.000 --> 28:09.000]  NPR is the only big swinging mainstream media outlets of last dinosaur standing. And so CNN, MSNBC attack us. That's that's a joke.
[28:09.000 --> 28:18.000]  But let me tell you, you get all the broadcast attacking you. You get NPR attacking you. I'm not a drinking man. I'm a tea toddler these days.
[28:18.000 --> 28:29.000]  But this is the time that I might want to get some Dom Perry on out and just drink it because they held off with their final big guns, their main capital ships attacking us until now.
[28:29.000 --> 28:46.000]  That means because they know the danger of sending us their audiences. But they think their NPR audience is so kept, so brainwashed, so shutter minded, so stupid that they can actually attack me and that like cult members, they won't go here when Alex Jones is actually saying.
[28:46.000 --> 28:59.000]  But they sit there in Marvel and they go, he's very convincing. He's dangerous. He has a giant audience. He is reaching 30, 40, 50 million a week. We look. He's not lying about that.
[28:59.000 --> 29:08.000]  And then they went to the real treacherous level. They they they have a good. Now let's talk to someone who admits a whistleblower from fake news.
[29:08.000 --> 29:17.000]  See, that's what that's what Beck is now. He's the conservative that admits we're all wrong and we're all fake. And he goes all the shows and they say he's apologized. He's a good guy now by his book on NPR.
[29:17.000 --> 29:25.000]  He's the Judas Iscariot, the trader, the Benedict Arnold. But see, they bring on another guy who goes, yeah, I put out fake news. Here's how I've done it for years.
[29:25.000 --> 29:35.000]  The flying saucers landing stuff like that. And yeah, that's how Alex does it. So, oh, person didn't work with me. It seems, you know, it's just, oh, and here's a fake news person admitting it.
[29:35.000 --> 29:49.000]  So it's an it's one fake news guy on NPR, the fake news king sitting there on taxpayer state run media foundation and state run media saying I'm fake news because I said Trump is going to win.
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.000]  Good luck, bastards. Scum.
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  You can't be real.
[29:55.000 --> 30:06.000]  And I'm bonafide. Good old boy guts.
[30:26.000 --> 30:38.000]  For example, CBS News just listed info wars as a fake news website. And that's because the mainstream establishment media is losing all credibility with the American people.
[30:38.000 --> 30:44.000]  And it was alternative and social media who helped Donald Trump win the presidential election.
[30:44.000 --> 30:55.000]  And now the globalist battle plan is to indoctrinate the masses into only accepting the establishment viewpoint of what they want you to believe is real news.

[33:34.000 --> 33:53.000]  Be welcomed on the island without name. Longing for the sun, you will come to the island many miles away from home.
[33:53.000 --> 34:04.000]  Well, he's not been doing a lot of interviews and I'm glad he hasn't been because he's a busy man. He is hosting the fourth hour today and in the next few months he's going to kick off a daily broadcast right here at InfoWars.
[34:04.000 --> 34:16.000]  He's writing what will be the definitive inside scoop on how Trump decided to run for president, what happened inside the campaign, the battles and then right through the inaugurations coming out in the next few months.
[34:16.000 --> 34:26.000]  It will be the total inside scoop on the whole situation. But he is joining us here. Obviously, he was all over the news yesterday entering Trump Tower through the front door.
[34:26.000 --> 34:41.000]  And of course, all the real important businesses are going to the back door. I'm being sarcastic and we just had one of the biggest Japanese titans announced $50 million to be put in here in the United States because now we have new leadership and are going to be cutting corporate income tax.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  If our taxes are the highest in the world, the Japanese can't invest here even though they've been trying to. I got to hand it to them with all their Toyota plants.
[34:47.000 --> 34:54.000]  They've been building more plants here than Ford, Chevy and Dodge combined. They got like three of them in Texas and a lot of people are employed by it.
[34:54.000 --> 35:05.000]  They build good trucks. So they're doing the fair deal in trade. Oh, you buy our stuff. We come and build in your country and we employ people and pay the highest wages in the U.S. and an auto factory.
[35:05.000 --> 35:14.000]  So I'm really commending the Japanese for what they're doing, but carriers back. Ford's now not announced one, but two plants says they may bring them all back when the taxes get cut.
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  Globalism set this up. The globalist to move it offshore.
[35:18.000 --> 35:27.000]  Now, yesterday we saw the EU on Facebook demand that quote, fake news be taken down. Today it started.
[35:27.000 --> 35:36.000]  If you post FBI statistics that blacks commit 10 times more crimes against whites and vice versa. It's just a fact because the whole race thing's been been hyped up.
[35:36.000 --> 35:47.000]  Your side is taken down as fake news. If you post the Islamic rapist who raped and killed a young woman in Germany, they call it hate and remove you off of Facebook.
[35:47.000 --> 35:55.000]  So it is beginning. Methodist churches converting to virtual mosque for Muslim migrants. That's happening all over the U.S. and the world.
[35:55.000 --> 36:05.000]  The major Methodist churches here in Austin are pulling crosses out and actually hold services and ask you to give money to Bill and Melinda Gates.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  And they tell you, I have been in one when they took an offering for Bill and Melinda Gates for their whole eugenics program worldwide.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  I mean, the Methodist church is, I mean, look at the Catholic church set it up by the new Pope. I mean, it's like Communist Party USA.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  I don't use that as some verbal flourish. I mean, it's happening.
[36:21.000 --> 36:30.000]  This is just insane. What's I mean, they are moving on every front. So Paul Watson has written the definitive with myself.
[36:30.000 --> 36:41.000]  List of true fake news and obviously it's everything from media matters to CNN. And then we show examples of where they've put out known lies and the emails where they admit their line.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  Not circumstantial where they accidentally lied. We have them admitting their line.
[36:46.000 --> 36:53.000]  So they got caught. They were destroyed. They collapsed the election. They want to resurrect with massive censorship in Europe and here.
[36:53.000 --> 36:59.000]  And they've now announced 48 hours ago that when 24 hours, they would start censoring and it's begun.
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.000]  So I'm having trouble believing this is even happening. I knew it was coming. Drudge warned me. Supreme Court Justice warned him.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  I've been warned by other high level congressmen that this is indeed going on.
[37:08.000 --> 37:19.000]  I'm going to read this whole article. Go over examples. But Roger Stone has listed some of the fake news indexes that are quote written by single university professors.
[37:19.000 --> 37:25.000]  They don't say why they got the researcher. How they decide you don't exist or should be banned. You just are putting an electronic ghetto.
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  Bye bye off to the off on the trains on the digital trains.
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  But, you know, Hitler first shut down the Jews and other speech and then put them in ghettos and the next came the arrest. This is how they do it.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  But we have the president who just was announced man of the year in time magazine.
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  Let's put dredgerport.com back up on screen. Make media great again.
[37:48.000 --> 37:56.000]  And there it is. Person of the year. Donald John Trump. And who's the real person of the year behind Trump? All of us.
[37:56.000 --> 38:01.000]  We all share in breaking the will of the mainstream media. What a time to be alive.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  So on every front, ladies and gentlemen, they're failing, but they're all over the news thing. Let's censor him off Twitter.
[38:07.000 --> 38:14.000]  So out of one side of their mouth, they're admitting he's man of the year. But let's censor him. He's a racist. He's bad. Let's block him.
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  Then they have the recounts. And as of last night, I haven't checked today. Give me the latest numbers.
[38:18.000 --> 38:29.000]  Wisconsin, he had 77,000 more votes gained that Hillary's people had basically stolen or had just accidentally in all these states, all the theft.
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.000]  I mean, you know, nine out of 10 are from the Hillary camp. Oh, surprise, surprise.
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  And then people say, oh, now you're glad there was a recount. No, because we had voting experts on that should all the fraud was against Trump.
[38:41.000 --> 38:47.000]  He really won five other states. And now we're seeing he was right that millions of people voted that shouldn't have.
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  Now we're learning the truth. If you added all the states up, it was 77,000 and the recount's only half done. Where is it really?
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  Joining us till the end of the hour is the man who was the head of the Trump campaign when it all began.
[39:00.000 --> 39:08.000]  A man who's quietly been an advisor, I guess, behind the throne there. This is a very exciting time to be alive.
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  Trump is really doing a lot of amazing things. I will say to Roger out of the gates, I don't like to don't burn the American flag.
[39:13.000 --> 39:18.000]  You're in jail thing. And though Hillary pushed that in 2004, so she's a hypocrite, I get their anti-America.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  They hate the country. He wants to bring it back and they want to ban our free speech and ban crosses and arrest us.
[39:23.000 --> 39:29.000]  So he says, we'll arrest you if you kill our symbols. I get what he's doing invoking Americana, but it's almost getting to their level.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  I don't want to start with the criticism, but we can't just gush here. What do you think, Roger?
[39:33.000 --> 39:40.000]  Well, Alex, first of all, thanks for having me on. Look, I agree with Trump's sentiments.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  These people aggravate me when I see them desecrating a flag for which so many have died and the freedoms this country has provided.
[39:48.000 --> 39:57.000]  Surely Trump knows that the Supreme Court has in fact ruled that this repugnant speech, free speech, is allowable.
[39:57.000 --> 40:04.000]  But only repugnant speech needs free speech rights. I don't see him focusing on this in any way.
[40:04.000 --> 40:13.000]  You're right. I went to see him at Trump Tower yesterday. I did a little brief interview afterwards.
[40:13.000 --> 40:22.000]  As you know, it's always been my policy not to reveal what our private conversations, but I would say a couple things.
[40:22.000 --> 40:28.000]  He's very upbeat. He's very optimistic about turning things around.
[40:28.000 --> 40:41.000]  He is working the phones like a Trojan on other deals like Carrier where he might be able to step in and protect some jobs.
[40:41.000 --> 40:51.000]  The mainstream media doesn't understand that beyond the thousand jobs he probably saved in Indiana, the significance is symbolic.
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.000]  We're going to stop shipping our jobs overseas. We're going to start fighting and working to keep them here.
[40:57.000 --> 41:05.000]  America is open for business again and of course signifying dropping the federal corporate tax.
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.000]  Exactly right. He is deeply immersed in his cabinet selections.
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  He has made some decisions that he hasn't announced yet and he'll announce them in his own due time.
[41:18.000 --> 41:29.000]  There are other decisions still being pondered, but he points out that he is actually not behind the pace of some of the other previous administrations.
[41:29.000 --> 41:41.000]  He's very excited about my book, The Making of the President, how Donald Trump 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated an American revolution and proved the mainstream media wrong,
[41:41.000 --> 41:50.000]  and he's particularly happy about the blueprint for America that's going to be in the appendix of the book to kind of outline where we're going.
[41:50.000 --> 42:02.000]  Generally speaking, he's in an extraordinarily good mood. He's working very hard hours. I saw him walking the Japanese billionaire you referred to to the elevators.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  It was an auxiliary and experience.
[42:05.000 --> 42:16.000]  I don't think I've ever seen one of those Japanese Titans and obviously Sun's one of the biggest of the four or five guys that run Japan beaming. He just loved Trump.
[42:16.000 --> 42:23.000]  They have only had a good meeting. As I said, it was actually very cool to come in the front door for a change.
[42:23.000 --> 42:31.000]  I didn't mean to interrupt you. It's such an exciting time. I'm talking about a Trojan. Talk about a Herculean task cleaning out the Aegean stables.
[42:31.000 --> 42:43.000]  I mean, this is incredible draining the swamp here. I know for a fact, and I'll just leave it at that, that Trump really is working the phones at 2 a.m. in Russia and Asia and in Europe as soon as people are up.
[42:43.000 --> 42:54.000]  People are going to really freak out when he says, winning, winning, winning, winning. When we've been sold out on purpose, his job's not easy, but it's not hard when he takes action because this was all deliberate.
[42:54.000 --> 43:08.000]  So he can deliberately undo it. What are they going to do when he gets in and every day major corporations are announcing they're coming here and wages explode and the economy explodes and the receipts and the tax base explode and the deficit starts going down?
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  This is going to be amazing.
[43:10.000 --> 43:16.000]  Well, he clearly understands that revitalizing the economy is the key to everything else he wants to achieve.
[43:16.000 --> 43:25.000]  Now you have the money to build the wall. Now you have the money to rebuild our national defenses. Now you have the money to take care of our veterans.
[43:25.000 --> 43:37.000]  The answer to everything is always a booming economy, and he's very focused on being the job's president. He's very focused on reversing all of the trends.
[43:37.000 --> 43:47.000]  I know he huddled with Larry Kudlow the other day, who I think is literally the smartest guy around in terms of growth economics and what can be done to spur this economy.
[43:47.000 --> 43:56.000]  I think the appointment of Steve Mnuchin tells us that Trump himself is going to dictate economic policy.
[43:56.000 --> 44:06.000]  Remember, it was John Connolly, Richard Nixon's secretary to Treasury, who talked him into wage and price controls, one of the worst decisions ever made.
[44:06.000 --> 44:20.000]  Trump is going to have his own imprimatur on economic policy. And if you want to know what he's going to do, unlike every other politician in the world, go to his economic plan that he laid out in the campaign because that's exactly what he intends to do.
[44:20.000 --> 44:27.000]  And let me lay this out. I don't want to get into the whole attack on free press. It's just unprecedented. I mean, I cannot exaggerate how big it is, how real it is.
[44:27.000 --> 44:36.000]  I mean, I'm trying to get words described just how bad it is, and I'm coming up short. But pulling back, I'm now seeing a little bit of truth from CNN, which is very unusual.
[44:36.000 --> 44:46.000]  And even the New York Times, they go, OK, we admit it. He's not really a super right winger. He's a populist. He's doing a bunch of stuff the classical left wanted, a bunch of stuff the classical right wanted.
[44:46.000 --> 44:53.000]  And they're all getting behind him now because they just want results and a good economy. And OK, it's true. He was never against gays.
[44:53.000 --> 45:04.000]  And so I'm seeing some of the media almost schizophrenically intensify their lives about Trump. But in the same institutions, I'm seeing editorial articles from liberals now going, OK, we screwed up.
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.000]  We're wrong. Trump just wants to make us rich. So have you seen this schizophrenia I'm seeing?
[45:10.000 --> 45:21.000]  A little bit, but I think it is caused by the fact that Trump wisely has been making some conciliatory comments about healing the country and moving together forward as one.
[45:21.000 --> 45:35.000]  Also, remember the backdrop. Right now, there are hundreds of establishment quidrlings, Trojan horses trying to get into this administration swearing, oh, I was for Trump the whole time when they were.
[45:35.000 --> 45:47.000]  So that's your backdrop. When the left loses an election, as they did with Reagan, as they did with Nixon, their next move is to try to co-opt the winner.
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  Exactly. That's why I was going there.
[45:49.000 --> 45:59.000]  You don't know anything about governing, working to help you. And then they begin to undo your programs and tell you why, what you proposed the election, while it may have been great rhetoric.
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  Well, I'll say this about conservatives, even though they're wrong sometimes and can be warmongers because I see myself as a libertarian.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  But Gary Johnson kind of ruined that label for a while. I hope we can resuscitate it.
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  That conservatives will tell you what they're really going to do generally, and that's the way it is.
[46:15.000 --> 46:23.000]  Leftists will lie to you to get you to talk to them or work with them and then stab you in the back and then come back again and say, I didn't really mean that.
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  Let me back in again. They really are a weasley bunch.
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  Of that, there is no question.
[46:30.000 --> 46:38.000]  And the glad handers and the self-promoters are marching on Trump Tower en masse.
[46:38.000 --> 46:56.000]  I mean, people are submitting their resumes to this transition who have never shared Trump's philosophy and, in fact, are probably responsible for a number of the bad policy decisions that have brought the country to where it is today.
[46:56.000 --> 47:00.000]  So, you know, he's got to sort through all that.
[47:00.000 --> 47:08.000]  At heart, he is still a businessman and he's interested in the bottom line for America's jobs and prosperity.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  That is really the focus.
[47:10.000 --> 47:17.000]  What do you make of the Godfather of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, meeting with Mr. Trump, President Trump?
[47:17.000 --> 47:28.000]  Not surprising because Rahm's brother, Ari Emanuel, the king of Hollywood, it has been Donald's agent for many years.
[47:28.000 --> 47:40.000]  He was a guy who brought the apprentice to television and I think brokered the deal with Mark, the producer who I actually saw yesterday, leaving just before I got there.
[47:40.000 --> 47:56.000]  So, I don't find that surprising. I also think Rahm is a bit of a groupie and the two brothers are intensely interested and focused on politics.
[47:56.000 --> 48:05.000]  So, let's face it, it's a statue elevator, statue elevator for the mayor of Chicago to meet with the president-elect.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  I would bet that was set up through his brother.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  Now, Denzel Washington was asked by the mainstream media about fake news and how we need to censor it.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  He said, fake news, I've got the clip right here. He said, it's mainstream media that's fake news.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  He said, I don't believe a word you say.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  He basically goes on to say he goes to the internet and then makes up his own mind.
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  That's what's happening. There's a great editorial cartoon that's on my Twitter.
[48:29.000 --> 48:39.000]  We'll put up on screen in a few minutes here that shows Trump throwing a football over the mainstream media to a guy sitting in an easy chair and it says social media on the football.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  He's just bypassing them. They've officially died.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  Next hour, we're going to play a clip of the speech James O'Keefe kid where he's basically, you know, heralding that.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  I mean, we're not just saying that. It's true. I wish the media hadn't killed themselves.
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.000]  No, Alex, you're absolutely right. Fake news really is a problem in this country.
[48:55.000 --> 49:03.000]  CNN, that's fake news. Rex McConnish lies. John King lies. These people lie.
[49:03.000 --> 49:08.000]  They go on the air and they say things that they know are falsehoods again and again and again.
[49:08.000 --> 49:14.000]  So there is a problem with fake news. That doesn't mean I think they should be banned or censored. They don't need to be.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  Their ratings are falling. No one's watching because no one believes them.
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  And ultimately, they'll go out of business because they will no longer be profitable.
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  That's because they literally never tell the truth.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  Well, that's my next question, obviously. You've had your head down, I know, right in the book.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  So you've only been doing some, you know, inside stuff, obviously, and then talking to me and doing a few shows.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  But I brought you up to speed last night and you, oh, that makes sense.
[49:37.000 --> 49:42.000]  That's why when I was walking in, you know, to Trump Tower, they said, hey, tell us about PizzaGate.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  And you were like, I haven't even heard of that. Well, according to mainstream media, you are at the center of it.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  Well, I went and looked it up. I've tried to get you to talk about it.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  You said on air, let's look at the paper play, the quid pro quo at State Department through the foundation,
[49:55.000 --> 50:03.000]  not at this unsubstantiated stuff. So because you said, let's not really go there, you are now behind it.
[50:03.000 --> 50:13.000]  Yeah, this is an irony. Look, when the treasure trove of Clinton emails were ultimately released by WikiLeaks,
[50:13.000 --> 50:22.000]  I thought that the most devastating information there related to corruption, venal corruption, and treason, as opposed to sex.
[50:22.000 --> 50:31.000]  There's some provocative and odd things that appear to be sexually related, but I don't think that was going to drive the American voters.
[50:31.000 --> 50:39.000]  All I have observed is that some of these emails, the Podesta Brothers seem to use keywords which I have read elsewhere.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.000]  The FBI has connected to pedophilia. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying.
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.000]  That's right. We've never said anything. I don't know.
[50:47.000 --> 50:53.000]  We are saying Clinton flies on the Lolita Express with the convicted pedophile. I mean, obviously this stuff goes on.
[50:53.000 --> 51:10.000]  We're not saying these other people are involved. We're just covering it. But the fake news knows that. We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[51:24.000 --> 51:32.000]  Unlike other preps, Solark is used every day to help offset your electric bill automatically.

[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  Watch people's heads of roll.
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  When they're the fake corporate state-run media, now mainstream media is dead except NPR, state-run.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  It's got big FM transmitters, 100,000 waters in every city.
[55:04.000 --> 55:09.000]  In many areas, that's all you've got in rural areas is NPR. It is brainwashing.
[55:09.000 --> 55:18.000]  And they are hitting me every couple hours with incredible lies having whistleblowers on that admit they write fake news, but not for my organization.
[55:18.000 --> 55:25.000]  So see, that's how they do it. It's amazing. Meanwhile, self-proclaimed hack came out yesterday on MSNBC.
[55:25.000 --> 55:30.000]  He said, I'll lie, you know, to the Clintons. Tell me what to say. I'll say anything.
[55:30.000 --> 55:36.000]  Glenn Thrush went on and said, shut down InfoWars. That we sent a gunman in, you know.
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  This is the stuff they're doing, folks. So next level lies.
[55:40.000 --> 55:46.000]  Now we've launched a petition. You go to infowars.com and it's on the front page. It pops up.
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  We're going to put a link to it because it only pops up once when you first go to the site.
[55:50.000 --> 55:57.000]  Defend independent media from fake news attacks. We're going to launch a new coalition with a new website next week as well.
[55:57.000 --> 56:04.000]  This is to get alerts on attacks on free speech and to have this petition when you sign it sent to Congress and sent to Donald Trump.
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  And I mean, it's going to be wheelbarrows. 10,000 people have already signed up since we launched it two hours ago.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  And also you can forward this petition on to other people.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  Will this save the world? No. But all the things we do together will turn the tide.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  And obviously Trump's busy with trying to get jobs back, getting his people put in place.
[56:24.000 --> 56:32.000]  He's not even aware, folks. I'm told, I'll leave it at that, that Twitter's openly doing a petition to have him banned off his own Twitter.
[56:32.000 --> 56:38.000]  So they want to censor the president. The EU announced censorship 48 hours ago starting in 24 hours.
[56:38.000 --> 56:45.000]  It's now begun through Google, through Facebook, through Twitter, blocking our websites in Europe, including Breitbart, Drudge Report and InfoWars.
[56:45.000 --> 56:52.000]  We all need to organize and fight this, folks. Sure, we just won the presidency. They're hopping mad. They're scared now. They're coming after us.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  Roger Stone, how serious is this?
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  This is very serious, Alex. And it's payback.
[56:57.000 --> 57:03.000]  What they realize is that in this post-reselection, the tipping point has been reached.
[57:03.000 --> 57:14.000]  Independent net-based media now has more power than the networks and cable TV and the mainstream media who were in the tank for Hillary Clinton from day one.
[57:14.000 --> 57:21.000]  Distorting any fact about Donald Trump and minimizing any problem regarding Hillary Clinton.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  And caught red-handed in the WikiLeaks, taking orders.
[57:24.000 --> 57:35.000]  And therefore, they are hysterical to try to discredit us. But all that these attacks on us have done is made us stronger.
[57:35.000 --> 57:46.000]  When the President of the United States attacks InfoWars by name, when Hillary Clinton attacks Alex Jones and Roger Stone by name, I can speak only for the Stone Cold Truth.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  My viewers went up dramatically.
[57:48.000 --> 57:55.000]  Our ratings on Quantcast and others went from the 150s to the 80s. I mean, give me context.
[57:55.000 --> 57:59.000]  Roger's like number three. We're like 80-something. And InfoWars is a small part of our overall operation.
[57:59.000 --> 58:04.000]  I mean, this is insane. We have 40-plus million on average week viewers and listeners now.
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  I mean, NPR might have that with all its shows combined. We're now as big as NPR.
[58:09.000 --> 58:18.000]  Well, and people have a hunger for the truth. And they know they're not getting the truth from mainstream media if they ever did.
[58:18.000 --> 58:28.000]  So this is a sea change that they now want to undo. The only way they can undo it would be to either shut down the Internet entirely and don't rule that out.
[58:28.000 --> 58:33.000]  That's perhaps why we're transferring control of the Internet to the U.N. in sanity.
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.000]  Stay there. Exactly. That's what I should have started with. In fact, that's what this is.
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.000]  Back in 70 seconds with Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com. SpreadInfoWars.com.
[58:41.000 --> 58:46.000]  SpreadStoneColdTruth.com. Because believe me, they don't want people to have it. It's powerful.
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  Share it with your mainline liberal dingbat friends.
[58:49.000 --> 58:56.000]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[58:56.000 --> 59:04.000]  We're making freedom go viral. And now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalist.

[59:42.000 --> 59:46.000]  That's InfoWars Prime at infowars.com forward slash app.
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Look, I'll say this. I never set out to have my broadcast be gonzo journalism where, like Hunter S. Thompson, you're the source of the story.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  But so often, if you go out and you get involved in the media and you go and really engage in real journalistic activity, you do become a story.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  And it is surreal to see the president, current president, Hillary, the big candidate at the time, and foreign world leaders you name it say,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  Alex Jones is dangerous. And they were on NPR this morning. I heard it. I said, let's see what they're doing.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  I tune to it. And they're talking about me because everybody's calling me saying it's just every hour almost.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  National Public Radio. You go to their website. We search it this morning.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  There's like 10 different stories the last two days attacking me.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  And it's all lies and twisted this info. And family members are calling and saying, how are you taking it? Is it okay?
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  It's like, yeah, they're a bunch of traders. They're a bunch of scum. They've been caught lying.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  I mean, they're implying there's no sexual abuse of children in America happening.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  We're making up the Pedophile Island in Bill Clinton because they say all of it's made up with this big distraction.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  So, Roger, again, thank you for all the great work you're doing and the four minutes we have left.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  How should we respond to this? I mean, because I mean, I agree. They're hysterical. It's pathetic.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  They're doing more of what already made them fail.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  So then what does that say about them? The Democratic operatives admit they're floundering.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  They say their party's dying. What's really going on?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Well, Alex, the answer is to the ramparts. I mean, we need to wage an all out fight against censorship.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  This is like the blacklist that was created in the 1950s that prevented artists and others from working in Hollywood because of their politics.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  And the left went crazy when that happened. We still hear about it.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  Now they have a blacklist, and they want to abridge our free speech because people are hearing it, and that's what disturbs them.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  They've just lost their election because of it.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  So this is going to be an all out fight. I feel much better about it because we have an ally.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  We will have an ally in the Oval Office.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  And therefore, I'm confident if there is indeed legislation to set up the censors in essence, the arbiters of what is and is not fake news,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  that's not an appropriate use of tax dollars, nor and it violates our free speech rights.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  I'm confident a President Trump will veto this nonsense.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Well, I know there's a lot of exciting things going on that we're not liberty to get into at this point.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  I've got some of my sources. I ran some stuff by you and you concur with a lot of it.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  Obviously, you always downplay your role, but you've been an MVP as the internal WikiLeaks show from the White House and David Brock and Hillary
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  to shut you down and ban you. They see you as the most valuable player out there.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  Obviously, other people on the other side know that as well.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  You could be getting more done as a free agent outside of the campaign.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  You've done that now, but I just want to say, folks, you're going to be very pleased with what's coming down the road.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Some little birds have told me Trump is really, let's just say, playing on these people for fools.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  Well, and I'm particularly optimistic Alex about his Supreme Court nominations.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  I think they are going to be very solid.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  And I think both conservatives and libertarians are going to be pleased.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  We are going to remake this court in a more conservative direction.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  And Trump is very, very focused on that challenge.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  And I know the kind of people he's looking at because he's already released one list during the campaign, although I don't think his choices are limited by any means to that list.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  So overall, you know, I'm planning on having a very Merry Christmas.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  This could be the greatest year for me in terms of my political experience as much as I loved Ronald Reagan and as satisfying as it was to play a role in his victories.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  This is the sea change America needed.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  At this time, we don't get co-opted.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  That's why they're crapping their pants because when the prosperity comes back in, they're not going to have anything to say.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  They want to break us and make us a bunch of kept slaves.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  That is going to have its back broken if America simply takes it in their hands is why the bullies have been flipping out.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  Roger, you're going to be hosting the fourth hour today.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Look forward to some of the special guests you've got.

[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  Joining me today, Alex, is that we've got rock icon Rick Derringer and Charles Ortel.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  BuzzFeed says white people are a plague to the planet.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  In a listicle published on Monday, BuzzFeed ran insulting and racist messages towards white people.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  Many of the presentations included hate speech such as how white people plagued society.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  White people are crazy.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  And white people are a plague to the planet.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  Meanwhile, an image is featured of the presenter who is a young woman wearing a Make America Brown Again t-shirt.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  And earlier this year, BuzzFeed also produced a video on YouTube that shamed white people for being arrogant, controlling, and selfish.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  Entitled people of color from around the world respond to white.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  The clip is a three-minute guilt trip intended to shame Caucasians into acknowledging how oppressive they are for being born with the wrong skin color.

[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  Hollywood is going bankrupt.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  Hollywood's being thrown to the forewinds, broken into a thousand pieces.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  And the Communist Chinese are swooping in with their big investment to buy up the big six floundering production houses.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  And they came out two weeks ago just stunning, stunning, stunning.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  I first saw in the Wall Street Journal and then I told the crew that I do this during breaks, I go, hey, I forgot, I saw this morning where Wall Street Journal, you know, Chinese government tells US government and media to censor fake news and quote, clean up the internet.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  And I didn't know it was in hundreds of publications.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  It was like some directives.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  They come in with all like three or four different articles like LA Times, Associated Press, and I go, no, no, no.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I want the Wall Street Journal and I go, oh my God, it's all over the news the same day.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Just totally controlled.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  I thought one article with the Chinese government that doesn't let its people vote and has mobile execution vans and total hell on earth.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  I thought it was just the Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  It was all over the news that day.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  And then I started thinking they just launched their whole fake news narrative.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  And there is fake news, you know, out there saying flying saucers landed in New York or Galapagos, you know, islands saw a Loch Ness monster.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  But those are like joke sites and they're satire sites.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  And I noticed before the election, mainstream media went pure fake news where they had all these fake satire articles at the New Yorker magazine that I kept seeing where they didn't tell you that it was satire.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  They didn't say that it was satire.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  It would just have some horrible headline like Trump tells his constituents he hates their guts.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Or Trump laughs at Fox News viewers.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  Then you'd read the article.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  He could tell it was satire and it was not true.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  And then you'd find the same writer had written three or four today for months.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  And then the left passes these around like confirmation.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  See, see, then they tell you about it and you're like what what is going on here.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  We never put out fake news.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  Yes, it's crazy to say that I'll never forget I was on Coast to Coast AM.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  I think it was Ian Punnett good host.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  I haven't heard him in a while.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  I don't know what he's up to.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  And I guess he hadn't listened to lots of George have been listening to me for years.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  So he knew if I was saying something, I might have my view on it or my spin on it, you could say.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  But it I mean, it's there.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  And I was like, according to the Associated Press, they had to burn fields in Texas
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  because live AIDS virus was being grown in the in the corn plants of the company protogen.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  And that the in that it was mutating into live virus.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  I mean, I was reading from the AP.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  It was like a two year old article.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  And Punnett goes, there's no way that's true.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  Alex, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, he goes to break.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  He goes, I apologize.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  It's real.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  And I've told these stories hundreds of times, folks.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  I drove down the street to Conan's Pizza when I looked in South Austin to get a pizza
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  because my wife wanted one.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  She was pregnant with our first son, first child.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  And she wanted a deep dish Chicago pizza.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  So I go down there.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  Probably only on 20 radio 30 radio stations at the time.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  Maybe more.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  And I was on a short wave in the Internet.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  So we had a big show, but it wasn't ginormous.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  But this stuff just started happening.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And so I'm in there.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  And I'm up there to get the pizza.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  And I got pushes me in the back.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  And I turn around.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  He goes, he wasn't drunk.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  He goes, I used to like you, but you're a liar claiming they got goats.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  They're parts spider the creek body armor.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  And I don't know how I know how to instantly assess things, especially if I hadn't
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  been drinking beer or anything.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  I don't know.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  It kind of takes the six cents away.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  I'll have a beer or two.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  That's why I've totally quit drinking.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  And I want to have it all the time.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  And I went what you went to UT and took biology.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  And he went, yeah, I did 1973.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  I graduated.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  He was like 50 something years old.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  And he started to put his hand on my shoulder again.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  I'm like, dude, are you drunk?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  He's like, no, I don't like lards.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  That's splice different species.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  And I went, man, it's on CBS news.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  They've got spider ghosts.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  He said, shut up.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  And I said, hey, back off right now, buddy.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  You put your hands on me again.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  I'm going to kick your, you know what?
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  I mean, that's how I am.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  And they backed off and I got my pizza and left.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  I was like, man, that guy was really mad because I freaked him out.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  Now today you're listening.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  You go, yeah, they got cows that create human milk.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  They got ghosts that create armored, you know, spider web.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  They got, you know, monkeys that are part jellyfish that glow in the dark and cats.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  You can buy cats in the US for $10,000 that glow in the dark.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  You can go online.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  You can buy them.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  I know somebody's got one.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  You can watch TV shows about them.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  I told folks 20 years ago about glowing cats.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  You could buy them in Hong Kong then and glow in monkeys.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  People said I was a nut.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  They had it in the paper that I was crazy and said that they had GMO glowing
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  monkeys.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  Okay.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  Now that's because a fraction of folks were on the web.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  Then I was reading MIT magazine and things.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  And so what I'm getting at here is they think you're stupid.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  They think you're dumb.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  And they think you haven't gone out and that you don't know about the Clinton
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  death count that, by the way, is in the hundreds.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  World Nut Daily to be safe says 33 where it's just completely obvious, you know,
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  arms and legs cut off.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  And then Fami Malik says they found a trash dump shot up and the Arkansas
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  medical examiner says that they died of self-inflicted wounds.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  You cannot cut your own arms and legs off and then put yourself in a trash can.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  I know in the Holy Grail the guy's got his arms and legs cut off and is, you
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  know, hopping around saying I'm the knight that goes, you must give me a
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  shrubbery.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  As soon as he goes, I'll give you a shrubbery.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  He goes, I want 20 shrubberies.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  I want trees.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  I want, it's just like pay the, pay the pirate once.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  You got to pay him off a hundred times.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  But, but MSM is in a meltdown conniption fit.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  And they've never wanted to talk about me.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  I was always the Texan, the unnamed one in press conferences for a decade.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  But they finally had to hit me with their big guns.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Broadcast TV.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  I've been on Nightline a bunch of broadcast shows, but I've been attacked
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  in more broadcast TV the last week than 20 years before.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  ABC, CBS, NBC Nightly News, local affiliates, national affiliates,
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  NPR every few hours with just lies and twisted garbage out of context
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  infob.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  You're looking now after Donald Trump at the most attacked person in
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  America.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  So again, I'm getting these calls ring, ring, ring yesterday.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  You're on NPR.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  You're on the Nightly News.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  You're on NCBS.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  How are you taking it?
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  What's it like?
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  I can't even keep track of it.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  And I'll go tune in.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  It'll just be me yelling and screaming from five years ago about
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  something and then just cut to something someone else said.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  And they'll go, now let's bring on someone who is an insider of how
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  these scammers work.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  And they bring on some guy with some admitted fake news site.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  Notice that you use not banning the onion.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  No, no, no.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  They're now announcing we're banned and trying to order internet
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  service providers to do it.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  And when the word's pouring in, it's happening.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  It's going on.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  So are people concerned?
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  Are people upset?
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  I mean, I've got to tell you, it's bittersweet.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  I'm sad for my country that it's this corrupt.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  But at the same time, our audience is just exponentially exploding.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  And like I told you, we've gained, I don't want to exaggerate
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  because I was trying to count them up, 30 affiliates.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  The last month, we gained something like 25 the month before that,
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  15 or so month before that, 10 the month before that.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  I mean, it's just extra.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  We could never give above about 175.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  It's like 250 last time I checked.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  And these are some of these are big 50,000 waters in places like Los
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  Angeles.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  I mean, people finally go, oh, I guess this guy really was right all along.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  I don't want to be patted on the back.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  I want to beat the globalists that want to make us poor that want our guns.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  Let's say our kids belong to them that say it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  There's zero bad reactions to vaccines.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  It's on the inserts that it can kill you, not just bad reactions.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  And so I tuned in for five minutes.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  And they were saying he is as convincing as NPR or CNN.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  He can act however he wants.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  He's very charismatic.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  He's very dangerous.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  I'm paraphrasing.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  It's pretty much word for word.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  And they're like, I've never heard NPR.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  She's like, and go back to sleep, little children.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  Tuck yourselves in and slit your wrist.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  Satan loves you.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  Normally it's like that.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  World governments here, but it doesn't exist.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  Oh, yes.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  So like, he's really dangerous.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  Everybody's listening to him and we got to shut him down.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  I mean, they were like, they were hysterical.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  And Roger Stone earlier crystallized the entire enchilada.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  He said, well, we know the UN started taking over the Internet.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  October 1st.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000]  We expected them to take six months a year to start.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  Oh, no.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  Oh, no.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Hillary had said, after I win, proving the alt rights of fraud,
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  she introduced it.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000]  We're going to shut down the fake news.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  That's two weeks before naming me.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  They introduced the term.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  She loses.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  They go, move forward.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  We'll use EU authority.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  Just like when we wouldn't launch wars in Syria,
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Obama said, I have NATO in the EU for authority to Congress.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  That's world government.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  That's treason, folks.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  That's like saying you've got a diploma, you know,
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  in the mail from 10 buck two and you're a brain surgeon now
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  because you paid $5 in the mail for it.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  We want the EU.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  That's launching its own domestic army.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  If you try to pull out of it, like, oh, you want to leave.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]  We're setting up an EU army that's going to now come in
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  and be stationed at your former bases.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]  Your troops are now under our command.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  Go to sleep.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  Imagine if Hitler just said to France, just stand down.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]  I'm just going to take over.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  That kind of happened, but they had a little fake war.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Now it's not even a fake war.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  It's like the EU army will be taking over your army in 2017.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  Follow orders.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  We're stationing troops for your security.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  And by the way, we're going to arrest anybody that criticizes
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  open borders or the migrants, the invaders.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  We're going to come back and break all this down,
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  but this is the multinational takeover,
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  but it's not just the EU.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  The Communist Chinese are in the news.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  That's their term.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  20 years ago, since we're in the web, they would say,
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  we've arrested a thousand people this week or more
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  who were involved in fake news.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  I think we need to do a story.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  I remember seeing that headlines.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  China arrested a financial writer for fake news.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  We have actually adopted the Communist Chinese fake news
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  censorship model.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  We knew Zuckerberg was meeting with him, but wow, wow.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  That's minutemanstove.com.

[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  Here to wish you all a merry Christmas.

[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  Thanks for keeping our American dream alive.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  original, diamond-gusset gene.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  Get ready for incredible fake news.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  That's why everybody tunes in to get fake news, no?
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  People tune in to get over the horizon insight.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  I don't have the extra crew of five people to sit here and chronicle everything I say and do to then show you six months later that I'm dead on target.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  But the listeners remember, we wrote articles about it as well at Nauseum.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  I said, when they pass Brexit, the EU is going to declare that it wasn't done constitutionally correctly, so you're still under it.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  They're going to terrorize you and threaten to cut off economic activity into your country.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  But they're already teetering on collapse because the globalist bring countries close to collapse to consolidate them so that if a sovereign nation ever breaks away, it can dictate to the larger system.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  That's why Trump is so effective, he knows that.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  But here it is, out of Reuters, I told you hundreds of times they would announce that this referendum was not legally binding because other countries have voted before to leave and they don't let them.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  And now they say they have an EU army that is going to come in and the mayor says he's going to stand with that army of London.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  And the police under his command say they will ignore the parliament and they will do as they want.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  It's not a foreign takeover, no.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  The UN taking over the internet, no.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  The EU saying censor the US internet, no.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  No, there's no world government.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  And you've got people calling me that I know that have liberal family members going, how's Alex taking it? What's it like? It must be held to attack by NPR and CBS News to be attacked by CNN.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  This is wonderful.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  You're like if I was an American in World War II and the Axis Powers were saying I was a bad guy.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  You don't get it, a minority listens to you of really cult-like, stupid, unaware, alone people.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  See, my identity is based in what I stand for and who I am.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  I am so proud right now.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  This is making us bigger than ever and so great in history.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  To be lied about by SCUM, this is honors I don't deserve. I'm not an egomaniac. I don't get into power. I'm not a narcissist.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  But let me tell you, I'm feeling real good right now fighting evil, having an effect, standing against them, being right and saying, I'm going to repeat what I said over 100 times conservatively,
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  thousands of articles total with all my hosts, all of us have talked about thousands of times.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  They're going to say it's not binding.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  They're going to say it's overturned. The government's going to try to ignore the will of the people and that'll only piss the public off more that they're under an EU dictatorship they never voted to enter.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  Did you ever vote to enter the EU? No, no, no. Did you vote to enter the TPP? No, no, no. Did you vote to enter the WTO? No, no, no.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  You signed a steel deal in the 50s and suddenly you got EU troops in your backyard.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Reuters, Brexit referendum, not legally binding, UK Supreme Court told.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  That's right. That's right. And they told us that super delegates would choose who would want and that Trump couldn't win.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  But we said no, no, no. Now, I predict it'll take the UK 10 years to get out of the EU.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  And the EU won't officially admit its collapse for another decade.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  Now, that's a conservative number. It may happen sooner.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  But not before they don't try to start a war to keep it unified.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  They've said, you know, I've read books by German chancellors and British prime ministers like Tony Blair and like Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Cole.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  Oh, I'm a fake news guy. I can list all these leaders when the average MPR person couldn't list their mommy.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  They've got to have a German specialist on even list chancellors. But I don't even know what party Merkel is on.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:48.000]  They spend all day writing some one minute report to sound smart and have some sycophant liberal trendy list of a fake intellectual.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  I told you they would do this, but I told you it would be victory because now watch what happens.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  Farage is going to come back. Before I had dinner with Farage, I knew he was stepping down from UKIP to quote, give the government a chance to let them not even challenge their power.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000]  Conservative party and everybody, we won't overthrow you. We're on the verge of doing it. Just do the right thing and we will stand down.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  I had dinner with Farage and he said, Alex, they're already terrorizing the country. They're already trying to kill the economy.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  People are bucking it. Brits are standing up. But he said it's rough, the threats, the death threats.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  I can talk about it now, he's talking about it publicly, the stuff they've done to his family. They've tried to kill him repeatedly, playing crash, car crash, you name it.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  And he said, but I'm going to go back in when they betray us. He goes, I know they are. I had to do the right thing, no, and give them a chance.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  He's even told, you're dead. You come back. So he's now stepping up. They're going to kill him. They're told, very high level folks say, you're dead.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:49.000]  So he's talking about a hero. That's it. This is the war we fight, folks. And it's just begun, but we're winning because we've got right on our side. Stay with us.
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:30.000]  Crazy. And white people are a plague to the planet. Meanwhile, an image is featured of the presenter, who is a young woman wearing a Make America Brown Again t-shirt.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  And earlier this year, BuzzFeed also produced a video on YouTube that shamed white people for being arrogant, controlling, and selfish.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  Old people of color from around the world respond to white. The clip is a three-minute guilt trip intended to shame Caucasians into acknowledging how oppressive they are for being born with the wrong skin color.

[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  I'm taking it now every day. This is soaking. Biotru selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you. We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.000]  Exclusively available at infowarsteam.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000]  Before America can be great again, it must be independent and free.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:18.000]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  We are now 43 standard days out from the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States. This is a real fight, Donald Trump's for real.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:40.000]  He is attempting to write the ship. The globalists have been dismantling the country. There was a foreign multinational corporate infiltration to the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment starting in the 20s and 30s.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  They came out of the church committee hearings in the 70s. Anybody can go read years of hearings.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  The hearings went on for several years, almost three years, and it's all there from the secret congressional archives where Congress agreed to this in executive session in the 30s, 40s and 50s.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  And it's down to every level. Now, you would have heard this thousands of times from me if you've been listening and some folks have 20 years.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  Thousands of times because I read it in the Carnegie and Ford Foundation documents that came out in different congressional hearings and in Anthony Sutton's books, four of which I read.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  I think he wrote like eight. Ladies and gentlemen, Anthony Sutton was the chief archivist of Congress.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  This is from the World Economic Forum. That's the public Bilderberg group meeting sponsored by the UN in Davos. And what does it say?
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  What does it say? I'm going to cover this coming out in the next hour and take your calls.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Welcome to 2030. I own nothing. I have no privacy and life has never been better.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  It describes a THX 1138 reality.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  Now, where did THX 1138, the college film, remade with Robert Duvall years later by George Lucas?
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  Lucas talked about it. It's based on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. What is Aldous Huxley's 1932 masterpiece based on?
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  Well, he gave a speech right before he died in, what was it, 62 at Berkeley where he admitted that this is an actual plan for you and your family.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  Now, how does the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN and NPR respond?
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  These are people that are having this done to them. They're not part of the ruling elite.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  And they don't have the basic instinct to stand up for their own species. This is so sick.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  Now, I've reverse engineered the entire thing. And by the way, reverse engineering, it's like finding the entire owner's manual and the engineering manual and the schematics and blueprints.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  I mean, in detail, they list in studies everything they do by the 1870s. And then they just augment in an update as they go.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  And I'll be honest, when I first learned about all this like 20 years ago, I kind of halfway knew about it before that.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  I obsessed on it. And the first five years on there, I probably read more on it than I've read since. I mean, I've read a lot on it, probably more than anybody, but these people.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  And that's why I don't care what the media says about me. I mean, I know I'm right, man.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I know IBM engineered the whole Holocaust and had the stupid computers with the numbers and planned to have it in the U.S.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  And I know all about Thomas Watson and everything. I mean, I know all about it.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  I've read two of Henry Ford's books. I've read the letters from Thomas Watson.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  I'm type of weirdo that goes to the National Archives online and, you know, reach 100 plus doors, Washington letters, and your wife walks in at 3 a.m. and goes, what are you doing?
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  And the rest of the story is you've just pissed in the trash can. These were too lazy to get up and stop reading the letters.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  Okay, I just told you the whole story. See, that's how engrossed I got in this stuff. Okay.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  I'm sure they'll run with that because I care, man. I care about people.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  You start reading how they're going to break up your families. You start reading how they're going to take everything we've got and how they want to wreck our humanity in a power trip and literally take our spark of ingenuity away.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  I've been on a coast-to-coast interview and couldn't get up and I was sitting there reading this stuff. That's a funny story. But the point is, is that that's how dedicated I get to this stuff.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  I mean, not anymore, but because I just almost can't read it anymore. I just can't even look at it anymore. I already know what they're doing.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I know their whole plan. I've read hundreds of their books, hundreds and hundreds of their white papers, listened to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of their interviews, and I know them better than they do.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  Most of these elites are just lazy and they just wander around from mansion to mansion and helicopter pad to helicopter pad and mistress to mistress and pedophile sex party to pedophile sex party.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  They just wander around. Historically, elites are always raping kids. That's history. And our government's been caught and other governments have been caught and it's rampant.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  And then they just say, oh, look, there's one pizza place they focused on. There's no pedophilia in the world and Alex Jones wants people to die.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  No, you're covering up for the pedophile networks and you know it. Shame on you. Shame on you.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  I don't know what to say at this point. I mean, it's just like what I told you is the truth. Of course, the Clintons killed a bunch of people.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  NPR. It's crazy. He says the Clintons killed people. They just showed some clip of how I talked about how they would have people killed.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  Shot stabbed, arms, legs cut off, tortured. I've interviewed the family members. I've had the victims on who were tortured.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  I've interviewed the police captains who had their former partners tortured to death and killed.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  I've had the Don Brownings on. I've had the cop that killed's mother on.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  They're so dumb. The FBI and ATF emails got released in lawsuits by family members.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:54.000]  And it's the FBI agents and German intelligence officers at the hotel and the planning and the witnesses and all of it, just of Oklahoma City.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  And that's just one little case. And I know basically a hundred shows of information on that alone.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  And all the cops and people they killed. And the Justice Department emails by then deputy attorney general of this is our D-Day.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  We got to get down there and cover this up now. Cover up what? That your bombs didn't go off inside the building?
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  The cops showed up, said, what's this? What's this? You keep your mouth shut or you're dead.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Out of the canine unit goes, excuse me? Then two weeks later they come in the office.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  You like your wife and kids? Keep your mouth shut.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  The problem is Don Browning was a Marine in Vietnam and a combat vet highly decorated and saw his fellow officers tortured and killed.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  So he went public on this show and named the names of the FBI agents that threatened to kill him and his wife.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Shove that up your, you know what, NPR. You think this is all a joke?
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  Because you sit up there in your little candy land offices spewing out government propaganda because it's safe and fun to be patted on the head.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  Is that your whole fake liberal ideology that tells you you're a great person? Everybody else is a racist and evil and bad?
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  Where were you for the cop of the year, Terrence Yeke, who looked to shut up about the bombs in the building,
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  who was there with Don Browning, who they tortured to death for hours before they blew his head off,
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  and then threatened his family to keep their fat mouth shut?
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  Where are you investigative journalist talking to Jane Graham on the ninth floor at the HUD building who saw and identified the men planting the bombs the day before?
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  Where are you? Let's just, oh, Alex Jones says Oklahoma City was an inside job.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  I remember he even says the Reichstag was. It's been admitted now that the Nazis fire bombed their own Capitol building February 27th, 1933 to bring in martial law.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  It's been declassified that Operation Himmler launched false flag attacks all over Germany to blame it on Poland.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  They have all these national shows. Alex Jones claims the Nazi staged events. They claim our government did.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  It's like all declassified. Operation Northwoods, you name it.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  But what's weird is they'll report it sometimes, but when I say it, it's not true.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  If PBS has a whole special, and I was sitting there watching Frontline one time in a hotel room, strangely enough, I was at a JFK anniversary meeting, and I was a speaker,
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  shows before I go give the speech, it's like six o'clock at night and Frontline's on.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  And it's about the Kennedys, and they had just declassified that Bobby Kennedy wanted to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Honduras, be able to invade Honduras,
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  because communists were taken over, and I could get his good cause, but I'm not saying do it.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  And JFK said, no, little brother, we're not gonna, he was Attorney General then, we're not gonna blow up the embassy.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  The point is, is even the Kennedys were looking at false flags, and then they just say, this crazy guy, fake news, he claims none of it exists.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.000]  So if you go to infowars.com, now we need to add a link at the top.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  As I've said, a defend free speech link, because a lot of folks have already been at the site today, so it only does it once as a pop-up.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  We need it to be a pop-up every time, we're just fine-tuning this, every time people go to the site.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  I've never done pop-ups, but it's a defense of free speech, we're doing it.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000]  Let's put it on the article pages too.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  They can excite them if they don't want to and go to the page.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  I want full, I've told everybody this, it didn't happen.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  I want full, maximum push.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:48.000]  And it says, click here if you want to get updates about attacks on free speech, but click here if you want your name and information signed,
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  or no info, just want to give a statement to this and we're going to send a wheelbarrow of them or more to Donald Trump, believe me, he's interested in them.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Imagine that stunt, us rolling that into Trump Tower in the media, people saying don't censor.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  And then we're going to send it to Congress.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000]  That's how we have an effect, infowars.com.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000]  You go there to the main site, it pops up, you can put your email in, boom.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  I'm going to get to the fake news article by Paul Watson here in a minute, but I've not plugged yet today because I've been so busy and that's how we fund this operation.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  Now, this was an idea because they're similar best sellers, but they don't have this ozonation to olive oil, organic concentrated skin moisture conditioners.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:38.000]  And the evidence shows, we talked a lot of the ladies in the building, they agree that concentrated purified organic olive oil is the way to go, especially with oxygen in it, ozonate it.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  And this would be our fastest selling product ever.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  We just got such a limited supply last time, it sold out in four days.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  And it took us six months to get more of it in.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  Now, this is a bigger order, so it might last a few weeks.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  I asked, why don't we order more?
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000]  But I can't keep track of it.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  We've got a great crew.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  It's just a lot of stuff going on here.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  It's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000]  It's powerful and your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  Extremely limited run of ozonated olive oil skin cream now back in stock.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  We have just received a new extremely limited run of our infowars life, ozonated olive oil skin cream after being sold out for six months.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  Just one batch of our exclusive ozonated olive oil skin cream takes three to six months to create in our US certified labs.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  That's what the process takes a long time.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  With the highest saturation of ozone and oxygen ever developed in a skin cream, this is the Rolls Royce formula for healthy skin.
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  I'm using this all the time now during winter to moisturize my skin.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  Boy, I have dry skin in the winter, especially on my face.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  This doesn't make me break out like others do, because the oxygen keeps the bacteria out.
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  This is our fastest selling formula ever for infowars life, and there is no question we'll be sold out very soon.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  This is infowarslife.com to secure your ozonated olive oil skin cream before we sell out of this extremely limited run.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or call toll-free, 888-2533-139, and again, we're going to put banners up on infowarsstore.com, up on infowars.com, or put a tab up there, defend free speech, or stop the UN takeover of the web.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000]  I mean, who could believe that we built the internet, designed it, set it up, kept it open and free.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  The Chinese, everybody want to shut it down.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  Now they're advising our government, and now we're to the point that they're trying to shut down infowars and brighten everybody else.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000]  And it's happening in Europe, and Apple's kicking us off and everything else.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  I mean, it's happening, and they're testing, they're testing, they're testing.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000]  The sea of Trump knows, the sea of Trump says anything.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000]  Last week, let's kick Trump off Twitter.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  That was a Washington Post, and they're going ahead with it.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000]  They're looking at ways to do it.
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  The President of the US telling his attractors that they're scum, that they're calling him a racist and every other name,
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  but oh, that's okay when they do his speech, though.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  See, they can't prove fake news in any of their stupid courts.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  Let's say stupid, the courts still operate, but in case they're on the First Amendment, it's still operating, it's still there.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000]  They want to get rid of it.
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:03.000]  We also have a mega special right now on DNA 425% off.
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  That is our flagship product with the bio PQQ CoQ 10 of the true organic forms of it.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000]  The Liberty Movement, again, is under attack.
[01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000]  We need your support.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  We have a lost leader special, get info wars.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  Trump is my President's shirt, only left in a few sizes.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  It's limited edition, and then it's gone.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  Red shirts, as Trump's my President, on the arm, infowars.com.
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  On the back, it says legalizefreedominfowars.com.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  We have the new Hillary for President 2017 shirt, because on the back it has George Soros the goblin.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  It says deport Soros, info wars established in 1996.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  I've been on there since 1995.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  You want to know the lore and politically involved since about 1992, but there you go.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  I guess four of that is in high school.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  I work for the Buchanan campaign.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  It's first big run.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  You make it all possible.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  And we have other great sponsors, not just the products that we sell.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  Please support our local affiliates.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  Become a sponsor.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  Tell the sponsors, thank you.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  Send them 100 bucks, 50 bucks, whatever.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  We're in a war.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  We're trying to shut down talk radio.
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  We're trying to shut us down.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  Where's your second amendment if they're able to do this?
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  Here's the good news.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000]  They miscalculated.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000]  I give it a 90% chance it's going to blow up in their face unless they start a huge war or set off nukes or something.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  And even that's not going to work because the military is so awake.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  I mean, we've got a true criminal enterprise corner.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  That's why the true fake news is panicking.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  But as I said, if you go to infowars.com, I'm going to put it on prisonplanet.com too.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  Let's put it on all our platforms.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  Let's put it on Facebook and Twitter and tweet out the subpage URL for folks.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  Let's get a maximum push.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  And listeners, help us do this.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  I've got such limited crew.
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  It's hard for us to even put the petition up a few spots on the site.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  We're going to push it as hard as we can, but you really decide.
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  And then that's an army of folks that want to be specifically contacted with news updates, alerts about what's happened, your first amendment, not just your second.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  We send you the gun owners of America for their instant alerts and say sign up there.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000]  Become a member there.
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  And that costs $5 or whatever.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  I think you should pay it because they keep the NRA honest.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  Ted Nugent, a board member, has pointed that out.
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  It's the conscience of the NRA.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  It really brought them back from doing some really bad compromises.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  That's another thing.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  As General Boykin has said, as General Flynn has said, and others have said, don't compromise with an enemy media run by offshore banks.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  Stop caring what they say.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000]  Stop caring about their lives.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  And that's more and more happening.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  But again, people that are in the bubble, still under its trance, they just, oh my God.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  You were in the newspaper.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Oh my gosh.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  Trump talked about you.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  Hillary, what's it like like you're elevated to some new cloud existence and it's just suddenly you're magical.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  Donald Trump puts his pants on one leg at a time.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  So does Hillary.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  So does Obama.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  Folks, I've been at the biggest Hollywood parties.
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  I've seen stuff behind the scenes politically that nobody else has seen except for a very tight group of people.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  There's nothing else there.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  That's why they want to keep you poor and disenfranchised so you're always desperate thinking you're not fulfilled.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  If you can go to a park and look at the stars in the sky or have a camera and take photos and paint and have healthy kids, it doesn't matter if you live in a trailer or in a palace.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  Quite frankly, even a nice house is always breaking in as a problem.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  So the simple life's the way to go.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  But they want to take everything from you, make you desperate and then give you a forced austere life where you can't even pay your own bills.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  So you have to submit to them.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000]  The answer is independence.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  Some of the things are bad.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000]  It's that you can't make it your God.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  It's a balance.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  But they're selling tyranny as austerity.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  It's saying it's good to be poor, but they're going to be rich.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  And coming up, welcome to 2030.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  I'm covering that in the next hour.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  This is the UN.
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000]  This is Davos saying, get ready.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  We're going to take everything from you and even lock you up in 200 square foot coffins every night for your safety.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  Oh yeah, they're going to lock you up in your coffin every night.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.

[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:13.240]  So, in panic mode, the corporate media, the state-run media, the deception media, the
[01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:18.680]  fake media, is now dubbing everything they don't agree with, fake and evil, and saying
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:21.680]  they'll ban it, including Donald Trump's Twitter.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.280]  And they have self-proclaimed hack journalists, calls on social media, in fact, can you guys
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.960]  grab the video from this, I forgot to tell you to do that, self-proclaimed hack journalist
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.440]  calls on social media to censor fake news.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:41.040]  He's the guy that got caught in the different emails, Glenn Thrusher saying, listen, I'll
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:48.080]  say anything you want, I'll lie, I'll make stuff up, I'm a hack, I'm a fraud.
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.120]  He said, I'm a hack, I'll do whatever you say, just tell me what to do.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.960]  Now, we know you're a mercenary, bro, and then they have you on MSNBC with its tiny audience
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:04.240]  of average 100,000 people, because no one with a choice would listen to you.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:12.280]  Now, NPR, though, has tens of millions of day listening, because it's state-run, it's
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:17.720]  taking over the FM dial, the lower end, it force feeds, and it's what liberals listen
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:18.720]  to in their cars.
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:24.920]  It's what, I mean, it's big, not as big as it used to be, but it's big.
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:32.080]  It's as big as info wars, domestically, and it is bad news, and it is in a live fest that
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:39.800]  is legend, and they would never do this before, but they think, well, people will go to him,
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:42.960]  but you know what, we've got to inoculate against him psychologically, because they're
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.440]  already going to him, we've got to tell people he's fake, so when they hear it, they don't
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.200]  listen, they are panicked on these shows.
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:49.200]  I love it.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:57.160]  I've never heard anything like it, and the line, the fake news spewing is just delicious.
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:00.760]  Having people on from weird websites that aren't even patriots, and then admitting they put
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:07.640]  out fake news, and then connecting it to me, that is awesome.
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.200]  You have totally blown your feet off.
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:15.560]  You have so discredited yourselves, you've gone to the next level.
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:20.200]  Did it work on Trump lying about him?
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.920]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:28.360]  Thank you for the deception and the lies, because you were lying before, but now it's so outrageous.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:32.600]  Maybe your audience of trendies will figure out that you're there to suppress them and
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.600]  keep them in a trance.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.600]  Now we start the next hour.
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:37.600]  I'm getting into it.
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:41.760]  Again, the petitions up on info wars.com, we're going to add a link to it in Paul Joseph
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:47.840]  Watson's article right now, and when you go to the main page, it pops up and put it on
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:54.080]  the sub pages, and this is to get news alerts, you name it, but I want to have hundreds
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:57:01.080]  of thousands of these next week to then print off and then have a reporter, maybe even myself,
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:07.440]  deliver it to Trump Tower and deliver it to Donald Trump, and then I'm also going to have
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:09.360]  copies delivered to Congress.
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:15.320]  And again, it's about the media stunt that, oh, look, all these people want open independent
[01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:18.400]  free press and believe the First Amendment and believe if something's fake news, it has
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:23.080]  to be adjudicated by court of law on a case-by-case basis for libel, slander, or defamation, or
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:27.720]  fake news is judged in the court of public opinion by how accurate it is.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.520]  So to have the mainstream media that's been caught totally lying and organized crime,
[01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:35.200]  basically, and racketeering with the government to lie to the people, say shut down the press
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.560]  as an unprecedented threat to free speech, it breaks it all down.
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:42.880]  That's a powerful short presentation.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:46.240]  They claim we're Russian agents, I mean, talk about fake news, they're the ones spewing
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:52.600]  the fake polls and Trump's going to lose, on and on and on, get this petition out today.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:56.400]  And in copy the text, post it to your own website, send people to it.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.040]  This is about you, the audience that has the real power to take action.
[01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:08.960]  Now, again, we come back out of a few clips I want to play in the next segment, I'm going
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:15.520]  to just read Paul Watson's article, Paul Watson Alex Jones article that goes over all of this
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:23.800]  because it details that the ultimate fake news list, infowars.com, the ultimate fake
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:30.600]  news list, and I think we should put it on Facebook and say real fake news list released,
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:36.320]  a lot of hoax, because this is the real fake news, I mean, these are proven liars, this
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:39.440]  is how we counter them, we're not calling for their censorship, we want folks to know
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:43.200]  that here are the WikiLeaks emails where they are hired to lie to you, where they say they
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:47.280]  want to hurt you and your family, they say they want to make you poor, make you desperate
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:49.800]  in the dark, starving, and that that they say that.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:54.800]  I want to tell you about a brand new often read product, it's a pocket sized solar generator.
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:58.800]  Even though it's so small, you can put it in your pocket, it can actually run some 110
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:03.480]  appliances at your house, like small refrigerators to keep your food from spoiling.
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:08.320]  The best part though, you can take it with you, it's mobile, to jump start cars, trucks,
[01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:11.880]  buses, 18 wheelers, huge tractors, even airplanes.
[01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:16.440]  The new PPX system provides an endless supply of off the grid electricity, basically creating
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:18.920]  your own private power grid anywhere in the world.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:23.120]  A true innovation, I have never seen anything like this, you're going to want to load up
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:27.640]  on these, one for your truck, your wife's car, your house, cabin, it's even a great Christmas
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:30.560]  idea if you've got a friend who wants to get off the grid.

[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:24.320]  Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed this video, I'll see you in the next one, bye.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:37.520]  Watching this transmission, you are the resistance, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:38.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:44.880]  So MSM's been caught in all the WikiLeaks from the daily show that I told you, these
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:48.120]  are the new WikiLeaks, I told you years ago it was White House Run, coordinating with
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.920]  the White House, coordinating with George Soros with Hillary, you name it, saying write the
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:57.720]  scripts, tell us what to do, you know, reviewing each night's show, imagine the power trip
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:04.160]  in state run media like the old Soviet Union of John Podesta sitting there telling the
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:10.920]  daily show who to have on and what to do, imagine that much work, that they do it.
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:15.280]  And then the lies about WMDs by both parties, the mainstream media going along with it,
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:19.320]  all the things, all the deception, telling you vaccines are safe and they know full
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:26.280]  well they're not, the chronicle their lies makes the head spin, but now NPR is the last
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:33.640]  big media, the so-called leftist, big Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, crime
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:39.960]  syndicate has, they get more than half their money by sucking off the taxpayer, 450 million
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.920]  a year on average, they then beg every day of every week to their brainwashed listeners
[02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:50.800]  who want to act like they're pseudo-intellectuals, they're part of a community, they don't
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.160]  have husbands or wives or any future in life generally, they've been atomized, that's
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:02:00.360]  their profile, very sad people on average who think they're intellectuals.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:07.400]  And they're sitting there donating money to this thing, so part of it's from the government,
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:14.160]  another part of it's funded by big foundations, and another part of it is funded by begging
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:18.280]  off the listeners, and they're on there, we have the clips coming up, I've just got so
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.600]  much to cover, saying, I'm at dinner this morning and they're just like, we've got
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.120]  to shut him down, he's dangerous, this can't be on air, I don't know why the Clinton's
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:29.360]  never murdered anybody, this guy's convincing, he can that look like CNN, he can look like
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:39.840]  NPR, he's slick, I'm slick, there's no teleprompter here, bubba, straight shooting, you want to
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:44.600]  shut us down and the EU does and the Democrats do and they're announcing it in Google, delisted
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:52.480]  us off Chrome, try to go to our website, it blocks it, saying danger, danger, Will Robinson.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:57.080]  But I bet you're going to say I'm after free speech when I say this, we're going to launch
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:03.720]  a national movement to have national public radio defunded, it's been so close, hey, if
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:06.800]  you can get the Ford Foundation and people to sit there and give you money, and if you
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:09.320]  can get your listeners to give you money, that's your issue, but you shouldn't be able
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:16.920]  to hog the lower 20% of the FM spectrum pigs, you shouldn't get that given to you, you should
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.360]  have to pay FCC fees, like every other free market group, and you don't get my money,
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:28.840]  you pieces of trash, I pay income tax and it goes into your pocket to sit up there and
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:34.440]  say I should be shut up and I'm a liar and I'm dangerous, you want to shut up my free
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:41.440]  speech and you say it on a megaphone that I paid for dirt bag, that didn't slick what
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:04:00.320]  I just said, it's Veritas, V for victory, V for Veritas, NPR needs to be shut down.
[02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:04.800]  They're so scared that we're radicalizing Trump, they're so scared that true populism
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.600]  and nationalism and Stephen Bannon is in there and all this is happening, they're actually
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:12.600]  going to make America great again and not make us all poor, that is the plan.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:17.320]  Trump doesn't, I don't have Trump's ear, unless it's an echo chamber, Trump thinks the same
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:22.480]  way I do.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:25.680]  They can't stand it though, they were going to be in power, they were going to run the
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:28.920]  country in the mud, they were going to shut us down after the election, they said they
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:32.240]  were and now the president's there, what are they going to do?
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:35.720]  Try to infiltrate him if they can't do that, kill him.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:38.960]  But by then you're so damaged, the fact that you're an occupying level of script that it's
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.480]  came over down the road, just like Riggs it.
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:44.520]  I told you before they even passed it, I said I think it's going to pass and they're going
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.560]  to say it's not legally binding and try to block it.
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:52.200]  That was announced today, in fact I'll finish that when we come back, then get into this
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:05:00.200]  big fake news article by Paul Watson, we've got to get out to everybody, stay with us.
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:04.200]  Buzzfeed says white people are a plague to the planet.
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:10.640]  In a listicle published on Monday, Buzzfeed ran insulting and racist messages towards white
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:11.640]  people.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:17.560]  Many of the presentations included hate speech such as how white people plagued society.
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:19.600]  White people are crazy.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:22.280]  And white people are a plague to the planet.
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:27.600]  Meanwhile an image is featured of the presenter who is a young woman wearing a Make America
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:29.720]  Brown Again t-shirt.
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:35.160]  And earlier this year Buzzfeed also produced a video on YouTube that shamed white people
[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:38.520]  for being arrogant, controlling and selfish.
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:42.800]  Entitled people of color from around the world respond to white.
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:48.640]  The clip is a three minute guilt trip intended to shame Caucasians into acknowledging how
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:53.280]  oppressive they are for being born with the wrong skin color.
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:06:22.800]  You can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:27.800]  Oh yeah.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.800]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.240]  It's time to ride, boys.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:32.800]  We need a thousand paul reveres.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:39.280]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:41.800]  And beef was for supper.
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:47.800]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:07:05.800]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:09.120]  about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:12.560]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.760]  it's very, very important.
[02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:21.400]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:23.760]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.760]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:30.100]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:32.960]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.640]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:37.520]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:40.720]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:41.760]  It's in powder form.
[02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:44.480]  We have so many five star reviews.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:49.960]  I take this, this is the product that I take, infowarslife.com, and the profit we make.
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:50.960]  We fight the global.
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:51.960]  We fight the new world order.

[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:45.960]  Oh, we're so intellectual, oh, we're MSNBC, oh, we're NPR petroleum radio funded by the
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:51.560]  Rockefeller Foundation and Standard Oil and the Big Bomb Makers and the Ford Foundation.
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:56.320]  Oh, we're so liberal, oh, we support all these big wars and the war in Syria.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:01.960]  And we say it's a conspiracy theory and that General Flynn is insane because he listens
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.480]  to Alex Jones and has retweeted our material.
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:09.360]  The former head of defense intelligence who was ordered to run operations aiding Al Qaeda.
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:11.000]  He doesn't know anything.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.240]  People driving around in their Subarus with their co-exist stickers, I'm not against your
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:17.240]  co-exist sticker.
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:18.240]  I just, you know, that's who you are.
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:25.240]  I'm just like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, we're not involved in Syria, we're helping man, just
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:34.760]  feeling good and yeah, fighting racism together and yeah, yeah, we need to shut down Alex
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:35.760]  Jones, yeah.
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:41.920]  And then you shut down Alex Jones, you can shut down anybody today on NPR.
[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:45.000]  The Washington Post calls for banning Trump off Twitter because he's a bully.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:51.240]  Oh, now we just ban people because they're a bully.
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:54.720]  Alex Jones is incredibly convincing and select and dangerous.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:00.800]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, it wasn't the NPR voice this morning, I tuned in.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:04.240]  We found a bunch of other ones, but we haven't found the one from this morning.
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:05.240]  It should have been uploaded.
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:06.840]  Go ask Buckley, he knows the show, he heard it too.
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:07.840]  We found it this morning.
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.840]  It hasn't been uploaded yet.
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:17.840]  They're just like, what, yo, it's bad, yeah, he needs to be shut down right now.
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:26.960]  He has, he does have 40 million listeners, it's been scary.
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:27.960]  And what do I do?
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:35.440]  I go, oh, look, here's an article by it on Salazar, I got stacks of new, but I mean, I'm
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:40.280]  going back to this one because I haven't plugged the clip yet, self-proclaimed hack.
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:43.920]  There's emails saying, tell me what to do, I'll say anything, I'm a hack, I don't care
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:46.560]  about the truth, I just want money.
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:51.040]  I mean, you read these emails, not just from him, but Podesta and all of them, it's like
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:52.680]  villains from a movie.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:56.000]  I grew up, you should see villains in movies, and I thought they didn't really act like
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.840]  that until I went to New York and stuff and was around real villains, and later people
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:03.920]  at the restaurant go, you don't know who that was, came over to your table.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.240]  You know, that's John Gotti's such and such, and I went and looked online, it was him.
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:12.440]  I love you, Alex, so good, who do we like, who should we do?
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:16.280]  Trying to kiss me, a big like six foot guy, six foot two guy, and he's like trying to
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:22.040]  kiss me and stuff, and it was like literally out of a movie, oh, Alex, oh, come out on
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:25.880]  a yacht tomorrow, I get kisses, I love you.
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:29.440]  I just think Robert DeNiro was a bad actor, because he'd play Italian gangster, he's doing
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:37.280]  that, oh, I love you so much, and you're like, this is fake, it's not, that's how they act.
[02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:42.080]  You read these emails, it's like, oh, we're going to screw them up real good, they're
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:45.960]  so stupid, I know we want to make them desperate and the dark and poor, you want me to pull
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:48.800]  the emails again?
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.960]  You're like, who talks like this?
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:57.320]  I'm sitting around the accountant going, the crew's really doing a great job, I want to
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:01.160]  really try to push, sell some more product for the year end so we can get a good Christmas
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:02.160]  bonus.
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:04.640]  Well, yeah, right now, we can't give too big a one, we need to leave a cushion to buy
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:08.520]  a product and throw stuff, and this is a meeting yesterday, I'm not just saying this, this
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:12.520]  happened, I'm here, how do I get my crew better bonuses for Christmas?
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:15.840]  How do we do better prices for our audience, because that's how I want to be treated, meanwhile
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:20.000]  they're just like, how do we screw everyone out, yeah, yeah, but then on here it's like,
[02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:26.560]  oh, I'm liberal, oh, I have the moral high ground fighting, racism and sexism, homophobia,
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:31.640]  really, Obamacare doubles prices in the first year, shut up racist, why are you getting
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:41.640]  upset, because I'm for real, so self-proclaimed hack journalist calls on social media to censor
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:47.240]  fake news, Hillary supporters still reeling over devastating laws called for censorship
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:48.240]  of independent media.
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:51.920]  I mean, this is like your restaurant can't get any businesses because you got caught
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:55.800]  with cockroaches in all your food and rat droppings and it was on the news, the health
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:13:00.480]  department shut you down for a week, no one's pulling up to eat your food, no one, what
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:05.680]  do you do, you start whispering, oh yeah, they got cat turds in their food across the street,
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:11.160]  oh yeah, they got syphilis on the hamburgers, oh yeah, and then they start calling and health
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:15.680]  department calls, oh, you know, bobs across the street, they're the ones that got really
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:21.600]  dirty stuff, and then they run over and like throw cat droppings, you know, under the bar
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:29.640]  stools, right as the inspector comes in, look, look, it's there, they shut them down.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:33.760]  I mean, that's what these guys are like, let me read it in that voice.
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:40.080]  Self-proclaimed hack and political writer, Glenn Thrush, participated in MSNBC discussion
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:46.080]  with the topic of conversation centered around censoring sites like infoboys.com and social
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:50.720]  media, and of course they list us front and center.
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:55.480]  They name the social media companies to be responsible for restricting potentially inflammatory
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:14:00.320]  incitements of violence, thrust questions why those company CEOs haven't already developed
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.920]  a strategy to ban false and hateful content.
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:07.640]  Oh, like when somebody posts the image from the German news of the migrant that raped and
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:11.760]  killed a girl last week, that's been banned, or if you post FBI statistics that blacks
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:17.080]  attack whites 10 times more often, attacking black folks, still statistically crimes low,
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:23.360]  but to say there's an epidemic, why does attacking blacks isn't true?
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:24.360]  That's banned.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.360]  So they're already banning it.
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:28.520]  So first he lies and says that they're not restricting speech, didn't now it needs to
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:32.360]  be total, just banned people completely.
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:34.880]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:42.960]  And he goes on, naturally, Alex Shub's info wars were specifically referenced in the conversation.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:47.600]  The challenge to try to keep up with the pace of the information right now is worth noting
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:52.440]  that Reddit's pot, they banned the pizza gate discussion going forward.
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:57.640]  Post Peter Alexander said, I'm curious for your take on this, Donald Trump obviously
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:01.400]  info wars were familiar with that sort of popular website spewing off a lot of conspiracy
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:02.400]  theories as well.
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:06.880]  Even Alex shows the founder of info wars, you know, spoke profoundly about how I said
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.760]  something and Donald Trump spotted it a couple days later, no.
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.440]  I said we're synced up because we have the same vision.
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:19.200]  I told you what Trump was planning and then Bannon puts out a big article in Hollywood
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:23.360]  reporters saying bring back the jobs, empower the people, not make people dependent, break
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:27.120]  the back of socialism and collectivism.
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:32.400]  We're reading from the same sheet of music because we have the same ideas and they keep
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:36.320]  thinking that if they can get Trump to come out and break with us that they'll be in control
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:39.760]  of the narrative and then can tell him what he can say and what he can do.
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:52.600]  Stop relishous, relishous, ignoring you, laughing at you, making jokes about you, making a time
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:56.280]  magazine having to admit he's man of the year despite all their lies and deception.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:00.320]  Time magazine and Newsweek wrote for riots and violence to stop Trump.
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:03.240]  Oh, that's the coup de gras here.
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:04.480]  I've not really been hammering that.
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:05.800]  Watson hammers this about the fake news.
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:10.320]  I'm going to cover his article in the next segment.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.680]  They're the ones that lied about WMDs to start wars.
[02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:16.240]  They're the ones saying cops are all basically racists so when cops get killed it's okay
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:19.000]  like Newsweek said because we need to riot and burn stuff down.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  Remember that?
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  They've written articles.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.320]  This type of Newsweek called for burning cities and looting and death.
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:29.680]  It shows fires and says when it's time to riot was the headline.
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:35.400]  Time to have a communist insurrection from the big bank owned Time Warner because they
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:42.800]  want to destabilize the country and end a real discourse, a real discourse.
[02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:45.440]  So they're the ones calling for violence.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:46.920]  They're the ones fanning all the flames.
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:49.040]  They're the ones pushing the whole race narrative.
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:53.840]  They're the ones involved in all of this and then they have the nerve when jihadis kill
[02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:56.640]  people to say, oh, Islam didn't contribute to it.
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:01.280]  But then when we cover the pizza gate story weeks after it's out, we're the progenitors
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:03.280]  of it, which isn't even true.
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.400]  And then it's our fault if some guy with a gun goes in the pizza place.
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:12.360]  Not that he got Lolita Express and Clinton and Podesta and all this weirdness going on
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:15.960]  and people are investigating it and the cops are investigating it and so some pizza place
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:16.960]  is listed.
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:18.200]  So other people focus on it.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:23.280]  The media focuses on it and it's everybody to then focus on that as a diversion.
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:28.280]  That's how sophisticated they are at deception to basically divert people off into other
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:29.280]  subjects.
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:35.520]  But that's how dumb they think they are, that they put a guy that admits he's a mercenary
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:39.280]  hack for the government and the media who will lie to the public and says, I'm a hack.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:43.320]  I'll do anything for money on TV thinking you're stupid.
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:46.840]  This guy even defends the fact he'll do anything.
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:48.040]  He is even ashamed of it.
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.640]  That's what we have as a collection of these twits.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:52.640]  The center on it go.
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:53.640]  How do we discredit all the shows?
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:59.800]  We have some money on from an admitted fake news site, a clickbait site and we just say
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:02.800]  Alex Jones, King of Fake News, now let's bring on someone who admits what they're doing
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:07.960]  and then just, oh, then they had a fake news guy on who even wants the listeners of NPR
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:08.960]  at this point.
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:12.380]  I mean, you've got to say that's the dumbest group of people out there.
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:14.360]  They all think they're super intellectual.
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:16.040]  They all think they're super smart.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:20.320]  They all think they're part of some, you know, winning cool team and it's like, well, ladies
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:26.280]  are listeners because, you know, the networks for the ladies while they defend Saudi Arabia
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:27.280]  and everything else.
[02:18:27.280 --> 02:18:29.400]  I mean, it is a sick mindless pandering.
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:32.400]  Let's skip this break because there won't even be a show soon of a censors.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.960]  But you know what doesn't matter because that will build up an even bigger volcano of awakening.
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:42.520]  Here is the admitted hack for Politico.
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:44.880]  Here is MSNBC.
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:47.320]  The bottom line is this becomes a vicious cycle right now.
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:50.400]  So the media challenges Donald Trump, Glenn, for something he writes.
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:54.240]  Donald Trump says we shouldn't trust the media and as a result, the people in this country
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:56.920]  kind of divide and go to their own corners and they sort of pick their information as
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:18:57.920]  they desire it.
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:00.800]  Well, first of all, I think I know where I'm going to be having dinner on Sunday night,
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:02.880]  which is a Comet Pizza.
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:07.440]  The other thing about it is the sewage goes through a pipe.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:09.920]  The social media sites are for-profit enterprises.
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:13.400]  You've got Reddit, you've got Facebook, and you have Twitter.
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:19.480]  Telling to me why, is there a constitutional right to put potentially inflammatory incitements
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:21.760]  of violence on these sites?
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:28.160]  Why aren't Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook, coming up
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:35.200]  with a more serious strategy for either labeling or banning groups that knowingly push false
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:38.040]  and hateful content on their sites?
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:41.880]  The challenge to try to keep up with the pace of this information is to sell it right now.
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:46.160]  It's worth noting that for Reddit's part, right now, they banned the pizza gate discussion
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.160]  going forward.
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.800]  But I'm curious for your take on this, Donald Trump, obviously, info wars were familiar
[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:55.840]  with that sort of popular websites, spewing off a lot of conspiracy theories as well.
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:01.600]  Even Alex Jones, the founder of Info Wars, spoke proudly about how, man, I said something
[02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:04.520]  and Donald Trump spouted it just a couple days later.
[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:06.240]  Yeah, this is a bizarre story.
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:07.240]  It's astonishing.
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:10.840]  I mean, info wars, for me, was a great source of entertainment and a lot of laughs, but
[02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:13.720]  this wasn't a funny thing at all.
[02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:15.280]  I don't know what the prescription is.
[02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:20.040]  I think maybe Twitter and Facebook could do something, but it seems chilling to me that
[02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:25.960]  we're going to have people don't trust the media and probably from an ideological perspective.
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:30.040]  I don't know that people think that they're putting out.
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:31.040]  It's CBS.
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:32.040]  It's ABC.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:33.040]  It's NBC.
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.040]  It's MSNBC.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:35.040]  It's CNBC.
[02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:41.000]  Yesterday, too, saying shut down info wars by name on the morning, Joe Maddow, you name
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  it.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.440]  So they would never call for censor before because, you know, they could just laugh at
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:45.640]  us, right?
[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:50.000]  Like I said, six months before Brexit, on the day of Brexit and after I said, watch, Brexit's
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.000]  going to pass.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000]  They're going to try to steal it.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.480]  And then they're going to announce that the EU doesn't have to follow it.
[02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:01.680]  Well, here it is today, Brexit, referendum, not legally binding U.S. U.K. Supreme Court
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:06.440]  told the referendum in which Britain's voted leave the European Union is not legally binding.
[02:21:06.440 --> 02:21:10.320]  The Supreme Court was told Wednesday during an hearing on who has the power to trigger
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:11.320]  Brexit.
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:16.600]  Oh, the court is considering an appeal by the government against ruling last month that
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:21.280]  ministers cannot invoke article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, the first formal step, the process
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:24.000]  of leaving the block without parliament's explicit approval.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.360]  Oh, so the people can't have a referendum.
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:28.360]  Okay.
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:29.960]  Just like we couldn't vote for Bernie Sanders.
[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:34.840]  They took that away with superdelegates and mainstream media went along with it.
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:38.480]  And I loved how that last guy there that said in force is a joke when our audience is like
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:40.440]  50 times what they are now.
[02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:48.520]  They are a joke so that, you know, we used to laugh at it.
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:53.720]  I mean, you're, you're laughing at what I said they're coming after free speech and
[02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:57.480]  they're going to try to shut us down next year where a year later it's happening.
[02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:59.280]  Oh, we were right about that again.
[02:21:59.280 --> 02:22:04.440]  That's exclusive information from a sitting Supreme Court justice from one of the most
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:09.240]  trusted news sources and reclusive news sources out there, Madruch.
[02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:14.320]  I mean, you can't get more spicy and intrigue and more credible than that.
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:18.720]  I mean, directly from the Supreme Court justice.
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:19.720]  And it's a big joke.
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:22.440]  It's real funny.
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:26.000]  And then I told you that they were not going to accept this.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:30.400]  And guess how I knew that?
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:33.560]  Because we have correspondence in London, two of them.
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:36.120]  And we have sources in UK with the highest levels.
[02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:40.160]  And we knew what EU bureaucrats were threatening Farage with behind the scenes.
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:44.200]  By the way, I know a bunch of stuff right now that I'm not even going to tell you that
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:48.240]  the media would kill or right now.
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:52.640]  But see, I get the information because I'm trusted.
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:56.480]  I'm a real journalist, not a backstabber, not a hack like you.
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:01.520]  And see, because I didn't sell out for $3 million and then $10 million, oh, these were
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:07.200]  contracts I was offered in the last 18 years, $1 million, $3 million, $10 million, I mean,
[02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:08.200]  real contracts.
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:14.080]  Any of you little hacks ever seen a $10 million contract over three years?
[02:23:14.080 --> 02:23:15.800]  And you know what I told them?
[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:21.480]  You could take that and have a good evening.
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:25.200]  But I mean, I've been offered everything.
[02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:26.200]  And did it work?
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:29.040]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:34.360]  And now we're to the point that you openly want to censor me and everybody else that's
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:37.120]  kicking your butt up and down the street.
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:43.520]  Do you follow lawsuits on my fake news that hurt somebody that's provable?
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:45.720]  No.
[02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:50.200]  Because you know they wouldn't win and you know I'll fight them.
[02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:56.960]  All you do is sit up there and lie to your audience and get people killed.
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:00.080]  And say white people are a bunch of racists, so white people are being killed on the streets
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:05.840]  of America every day because of their race, but that's okay because you're busy creating
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:11.040]  a racially based society, how sickening.
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:19.840]  Now, I've got the NPR pieces, they're even worse.
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:21.400]  But this just illustrates where they're going.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:24.840]  I want to get into the world they're building.
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:28.600]  Now, when I read this article later, you're going to say, Alex, we've heard this 5,000
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:29.600]  times from you.
[02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:33.000]  Yeah, and only me.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  Only me.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:41.240]  If you go back 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, the last six, they have gone
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:47.800]  from denying all this and writing books saying I'm insane to saying exactly what I told you.
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:54.520]  Now again, I'd love to give myself credit, the Club of Rome, DeBose, MIT, British Ministry
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:58.560]  of Defense, Defense Department, they all have futurists that write white papers and books
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:04.920]  saying this is the plan since the 1870s.
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:14.280]  Now does anyone want to hear the plan from the 1870s?
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:19.960]  I mean, I had a film sold 300,000 DVDs about it.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:20.960]  That get any respect?
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:26.040]  The film got watched 20 million times on YouTube, it's called Endgame, Blue River Global Enslaviment.
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:30.760]  Made it nine years ago, you watch the film, people now watch it and freak out and go,
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:31.760]  most of this has come true.
[02:25:31.760 --> 02:25:33.280]  They're like, who the hell is this guy?
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:34.280]  I'm nobody.
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:40.320]  When I read robber barons writing 1100 page and 800 page books about how they're going
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:45.760]  to break up our families, dumb us down, drug us, put us in prison housing, basically, call
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:46.760]  it trendy.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:51.680]  They say you call it trendy with these atomized people that didn't have any families.
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:55.120]  As long as they think they're part of a tribe, we'll make the tribe's service to the government
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:58.960]  being slaves and then they'll be happy to euthanize themselves in the final phase.
[02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.520]  And then I've been told by the elite, Alex, you won't be part of this because you understand
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:04.520]  it all.
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.160]  You'll be smart enough to be part of this and have kids and there's ways to counter
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:11.520]  mandate and blah, blah, blah, blah, and you be with us, be with us.
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:16.000]  And I'm sitting there going, no, no, and then they go, watch this and they manipulate the
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  crowd.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.320]  I'm like, I want to try to show you how to be free.
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:22.320]  Shut up.
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:23.320]  It's like Omega man.
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:24.320]  He's like, I have the cure.
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:25.320]  They're like, shut up.
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:31.320]  Pro spirit right into him and the head vampire looks at you and goes, see, they don't want
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:32.320]  me.
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:33.320]  Hell.
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:36.320]  Cause I guess only like one out of a thousand of the zombies in Omega man can talk, but
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:42.360]  like the upper cast ones, it's kind of like a redo of HG Wells, the Eloy and the Morlocks.
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:47.160]  There's only a few of them that are actually, you know, real smart and they're real smart
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:50.640]  and the rest of them are like little zombies and they just, they just hate those of us
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:52.200]  that still got red blood.
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:53.200]  It's spiritual though.
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:56.520]  Probably have NPR playing close going and he really believes they're zombies on their
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:57.520]  Morlocks.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:05.000]  It's called allegories, parallels, parables, stories, how humans communicate most patiently
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  around the campfire.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.280]  That's how I communicate.
[02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:12.280]  And I've sat there.
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:14.200]  I haven't done it in years with the Morlocks.
[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:18.360]  John Harmon's heard a Morlock head of the Kissinger group was on and I was like, do you know
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:20.000]  this is Alex Jones?
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  Why'd you come on?
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.440]  And he goes, I thought you'd want to be reasonable.
[02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:25.440]  I hear part of the superclass running your conspiracy group in the future.
[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:27.640]  I know you'll always really need to come up here and meet with us.
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:28.640]  Come on.
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:29.640]  Let's come back and show that you can be.
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:30.640]  I'm like, no, I'm not.
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:31.640]  And he goes, I can't believe this.
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:34.440]  I'm leaving that I, I came on here to try to reach out to you and believe you'd want
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:39.080]  to have a life of true value and real change, you know, you'll influence things better working
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:40.080]  with us.
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.080]  John Harmon heard it all.
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:49.280]  Thomas Barnett, one of the top futurists in the military war colleges, gives these speeches
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:50.280]  on C-SPAN about world government.
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:52.720]  Now we're going to set it up in our military works for world government.
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:56.040]  They've recruited all these generals that are traders.
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:58.040]  And it was again, John Harmon.
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:04.960]  Harmon's been here 15 years and Barnett came on and thought he was going on Alex S. Jones,
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:08.600]  formerly the head of the New York Times who had his own radio show at the time on NPR.
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  And he heard me talking.
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:10.600]  He went to Brighton.
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  He goes, he told Harmon.
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:12.600]  He goes, I'm not going on.
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:13.600]  That's Alex Jones.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:15.000]  And he goes, just talk to Alex.
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.840]  He puts me on the, on the three way with him, you know, he passes me through and I go, sir,
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:19.840]  just please come on and figure out ideas.
[02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:22.400]  He goes, listen, you'll never stop out in a voice like this.
[02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.480]  He goes, you'll never stop our operations.
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:27.360]  The public's in a few weeks.
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.460]  He'll never beat us in like a voice like that.
[02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:31.960]  I said, come on then, prove it.
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:32.960]  Come on.
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:33.960]  Coward.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:36.760]  And I go like in a movie.
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:39.480]  And hauling the phone up.
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:43.500]  Harmon, I've never asked you to tell that story that was 15 years ago.
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:44.500]  Do you remember that?
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:45.880]  I don't know.
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:47.200]  Harmon's at the board right now.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:48.220]  I do remember that.
[02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:49.360]  I do remember that.

[02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:11.500]  Monday Buzzfeed ran insulting and racist messages towards white people many of
[02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:17.220]  the presentations included hate speech such as how white people plagued society

[02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:07.660]  has been called the iodine conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have
[02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:11.620]  known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how
[02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:15.580]  the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding
[02:31:15.580 --> 02:31:19.820]  fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good
[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:24.780]  halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as

[02:31:43.100 --> 02:31:47.060]  studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine

[02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:18.860]  animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about every amount of
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:21.420]  people they throw at you if you're doing this for the right reason God will
[02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:26.780]  throw even more energy at you and it's unbelievable the enemy knows about the
[02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:29.060]  spiritual realm that's why they try to block you out of it not let you know
[02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:33.420]  it's there I guess that's more fake news right they'll take things and spin
[02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:36.260]  things even in the New York Times and places about me the young Turks have
[02:34:36.260 --> 02:34:39.500]  done it I talked about God the metaphysical other dimensions that
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:42.340]  every culture believed in it and I said whether you believe it's space aliens
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:46.020]  or advanced intelligences or the God of the Bible I mean there's a lot of
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:49.620]  unknown out there and we could interface with it and science has shown
[02:34:49.620 --> 02:34:53.300]  it's there there's a lot of quackery and stuff that tries to intercess itself
[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:57.300]  between that that's the priest class just go around the priest class directly
[02:34:57.300 --> 02:35:03.540]  to God directly the truth veritas God is truth and they had articles saying that
[02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:07.980]  I believe space aliens run the planet for all intents and purposes is that what
[02:35:07.980 --> 02:35:10.580]  the Bible says the devil is fallen to this planet wants to kill still
[02:35:10.580 --> 02:35:14.860]  destroy the globalist have got advanced knowledge folks I've studied it and you
[02:35:14.860 --> 02:35:17.580]  come up against it and you come against the top globalists they're not that
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:25.300]  smart they're animated by something not of this world and nothing bites like I
[02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:33.660]  do not the screams out loud in the empty night think about it
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:39.300]  alright where should we begin here they found it I'm driving in the morning
[02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:43.300]  good job Buckley I almost hate to ask for that stuff though because he's really
[02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:45.700]  good at all the stuff he does but then he'll just fair it for them till he
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:49.100]  finally gets it and I guess he found out of all the hours the exact part I
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:52.460]  listened to for five minutes in the car this morning and like I told you it's
[02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:55.540]  just I mean you tuned in PR they're attacking me I mean it's just I bet it's
[02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:59.340]  like I asked me well when's you here I heard it at nine at night I heard it in
[02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:03.140]  the middle of an hour at noon I heard it was this show was that show but I've got
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:08.220]  a name of the show let's put it on screen for a moment and I just tune in

[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:46.900]  so it's taxpayer money again Rockefeller found me the list of
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:50.420]  robber bearing crux they had a project to take over radio they've been doing
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:54.140]  since the 30s they did it the fact you're given the lower end of the FM
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:37:02.220]  spectrum the best part free worth billions a year we're I guarantee you

[02:37:26.260 --> 02:37:31.420]  year at least of taxpayer money and big tax-free money as well and they attack
[02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:38.980]  free press and they attack you can't we call for commerce to defund NPR oh they'll
[02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:44.580]  call it the arts and school kids no it's not it's a bunch of garbage and see how
[02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:51.260]  NPR likes that you want to shut me down and put me in the street and put my
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:54.940]  first amendment in a jail cell they openly say shut us down and we're
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:58.940]  dangerous I'm gonna play the clip all over the news like I don't exist like
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:04.700]  I'm not a person like I'm not gonna fight back I don't get it about
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:10.780]  delusionals it's like Hitler he thought he'd beat Russia the UK and the United
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:21.620]  States the US was 200 and 40 million people then Germany was about 75 million
[02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:30.140]  he had Austria so maybe about 85 million total Italy wasn't even really in the
[02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:34.220]  war military was a joke I mean invented North Avery could even win that
[02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:40.340]  Mussolini let's throw in 10 million you know Italians or whatever it was more
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:46.740]  like 50 million the country but let's say he had 95 million people total you're
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:52.500]  gonna start a fight with combined populations of the entire British
[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:57.940]  Empire in the United States everything else of 500 million people of a total
[02:38:57.940 --> 02:39:09.500]  war culture that Hitler even said was the superior war culture to Germany but
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:16.580]  in your delusion you really thought you'd kick our ass dumbass and now
[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:21.460]  again obviously I'm at the British Empire in the US oh just don't forget the
[02:39:21.460 --> 02:39:24.740]  Russians they're like a hundred million at the time oh that's gonna be a real
[02:39:24.740 --> 02:39:32.660]  piece of cake and when the war was over there were how many about 54 million
[02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:37.700]  Germans and I feel sorry for the Germans I'm I think my dominant bloodline is
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:42.500]  German I'm a high 57 but that I got German quite a bit of it in there I'm
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:47.300]  honest maiden names Hammond well just look at me and Buckley we're just

[02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:16.580]  good Homeland Security running child kidnap and rings man and so we look at
[02:40:16.580 --> 02:40:20.020]  a story and say people are investigating this and so you lie about us and say that
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:28.780]  we sent some gunman or something because you want to censor us you're a joke and

[02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:55.660]  disgusting in fact the vision you have is like stunted and twisted how you're
[02:44:55.660 --> 02:44:59.700]  gonna enslave everyone and run everyone and control their lives and you're gonna
[02:44:59.700 --> 02:45:02.820]  be the boss and you're gonna be in charge and you're gonna control everything
[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:09.580]  and you get a repair truck parked outside my house just a morning is that
[02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:13.620]  electrical stuff going on power outages and the power went on it blew some stuff
[02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:17.380]  my house up you know it does that will blow out some circuit breakers and they
[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:19.500]  got parks were supposed to the street and some guy in the neighborhood

[02:45:22.940 --> 02:45:26.260]  to physically attacking and of course it's the petty power trip guy that's the
[02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:31.860]  head of the homeowners association I haven't gotten around to sending a
[02:45:31.860 --> 02:45:34.420]  letter because I'm sure there'll be some letter that I did something wrong and
[02:45:34.420 --> 02:45:37.780]  that's what I mean these guys are like ruling over neighborhoods yelling at
[02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:42.760]  poor electricians that's the exact type of crap I'm talking about you're
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:48.540]  pathetic you're a joke I don't think you feel bad it needs to be said you're a
[02:45:48.540 --> 02:45:55.340]  joke you call us fake media it's crazy of course there's no proof that they play
[02:45:55.340 --> 02:45:59.020]  clip of us breaking down the Clinton death list and showing dead people and
[02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:02.340]  showing news articles and showing documents but they just show a little
[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:05.500]  clip and say to their audience that's all he has he didn't have any proof see
[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:09.260]  it's all lies I could talk for 10 hours about this short clip it went on and on
[02:46:09.260 --> 02:46:17.740]  I'm play a short clip because it's all deception oh no oh no presidents never
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:23.380]  had anybody killed sure and the Clintons of the Dixie mafia oh they're very nice
[02:46:23.380 --> 02:46:31.380]  people they never killed anybody the CIA never kills anybody the army never
[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:37.820]  kills anybody there aren't Delta Force hit teams at the highest level phase two
[02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:42.860]  out of the normal Delta Force in every town oh no no no no there's like what
[02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:47.220]  does that mean exactly you don't know anything you're like children you're
[02:46:47.220 --> 02:46:59.500]  idiots now let's go ahead and go to the reality let's play a clip of our new
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:04.660]  Kings our Queens I'm being sarcastic that tell us what was reality and tell us
[02:47:04.660 --> 02:47:08.100]  what's fake and tell us what's dangerous and notice they'll mention someone who
[02:47:08.100 --> 02:47:11.540]  was fake that not me all this other guy was faking did something to me I'm a
[02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:15.580]  victim I'm a victim he says is how it starts and then it moves on to me the
[02:47:15.580 --> 02:47:19.900]  big devil here it is I think these websites the one I was describing that
[02:47:19.900 --> 02:47:22.940]  wrote a stupid story about me that made up quotes this week that's not
[02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:27.900]  propaganda that's just stupidity that's just tweaking me that's just trying to
[02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:31.100]  get Facebook share rolling but when trolling trolling that's the best
[02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:35.300]  word for it but but when it comes to a foreign government actors security
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:39.940]  services for other countries creating articles and no proof of that botnets on
[02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:44.020]  Twitter yes that is a propaganda and we need to like I said I'm back enough
[02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:48.540]  five seconds please they never proved the Russians were behind all this they
[02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:52.660]  said that I get my orders from Russia and so does Trump turned out Hillary was
[02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:55.340]  getting 35 million from him and actually making deals and met secretly with
[02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:58.140]  Putin never been to Russia I mean I'm saying the same thing I was saying 20
[02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:03.100]  years ago but see oh they're gonna get to me the Russian agent in a moment this
[02:48:03.100 --> 02:48:07.460]  isn't fake news though Alex Jones works for the Russians this isn't fake this is
[02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:11.940]  real also work for the Martians here it is pretty them through botnets on
[02:48:11.940 --> 02:48:15.620]  Twitter yes that is a former propaganda and we need to like I said have a better
[02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:19.740]  sense of what that is so we can call it what it is I've started coming to use the
[02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:24.540]  terms information warfare to talk most broadly about this because we are looking
[02:48:24.540 --> 02:48:29.940]  at information warfare in this Trump age we didn't start with Donald Trump but
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:33.660]  clearly that's what we're seeing right now and people in power benefit from the
[02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:37.220]  kind of confusion that we're seeing online today I mean they could take it so
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:40.980]  far here you could talk about information warfare you've got Alex Jones's
[02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:47.300]  conspiracy theorists it does info wars show saying 9-11 wasn't inside job the
[02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:53.820]  Fort Hood students shootings were staged and people listen to him I said 28
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:57.300]  pages the FBI was in the news the times and they were ordered to stand down they
[02:48:57.300 --> 02:48:59.700]  had at the transportation department said he saw Cheney have an order to
[02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:03.460]  stand down the hijackers were ordered to be led to the country now they were
[02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:07.460]  listed as Al Qaeda I've had the head of the embassy mr. Sprigman on and I said
[02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:10.300]  that they were covering up the stand down in Saudi Arabia it's all come out
[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:15.100]  the members of Congress on I'm proven right then he goes into the next point
[02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:19.660]  back that up to the next point's bull too let's play that one more time here it
[02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:24.340]  is just a lot of people listen to him this is him in August late August talking
[02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:28.220]  about people associate with other guys I want people to hear that again because I
[02:49:28.220 --> 02:49:30.500]  forgot the other part of it and it was alive that I forgot which one it was
[02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:35.860]  because I've forgotten the second point play it where he says oh Fort Hood Fort
[02:49:35.860 --> 02:49:41.580]  Hood I said that the CIA for two years know that he was talking to the head of
[02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:46.100]  Al Qaeda and protected him and let the shooting take place that was in the
[02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:51.140]  Washington Times even the Associated Press so I didn't say it wasn't a
[02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:54.340]  radical Islamic attack I said they knew he was doing it they knew he was
[02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:57.620]  radicalized they knew the attack was taking place and they stood down but he
[02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:02.500]  just says that I say it was all fake here it is information warfare to talk
[02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:07.020]  most broadly about this because we are looking at information warfare in this
[02:50:07.020 --> 02:50:11.140]  Trump page it wouldn't start with Donald Trump but clearly that's what we're seeing
[02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:16.460]  right back in a 20 seconds oh well there's only information warfare only
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:22.700]  started in the Trump page no the Germans called it info war or mind war in
[02:50:22.700 --> 02:50:28.780]  World War one that's what the British called it as well or propaganda and I've
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:31.740]  read the books by Bernays and Goebbels and all of them from both sides of the
[02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:37.180]  equation so again they're now telling you that oh in the Trump age there's a
[02:50:37.180 --> 02:50:42.180]  thing called info war the most important information war weapon is the truth and
[02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:46.580]  the moral high ground there's white propaganda gray propaganda and black
[02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:51.420]  propaganda we only use white propaganda that just means promoting your view it's
[02:50:51.420 --> 02:50:56.740]  got a dirty name but it's not dirty they use black you name it gray deception
[02:50:56.740 --> 02:51:00.180]  lies and then say it's us that's doing it that's what this comes down to so
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:03.740]  they're introducing to their childlike audience in terms of having shows shows
[02:51:03.740 --> 02:51:06.380]  New York Times because that's what they take their lead from is there a thing
[02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:10.460]  called globalism do globalists exist they go yes they want to help you but
[02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:14.100]  the conspiracy theorists say the global government isn't good it's this type of
[02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:16.980]  bull so we're going to talk to their mental mentioned listeners like their
[02:51:16.980 --> 02:51:19.460]  geniuses but but I'm gonna stop interrupting let's just play the club
[02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:24.420]  there's security services for other countries creating articles and promoting
[02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:28.620]  them through botnets on Twitter yes that is a former propaganda and we need to
[02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:32.540]  like I said have a better sense of what that is we can call it what it is I've
[02:51:32.540 --> 02:51:36.540]  started coming to use the terms information warfare to talk most
[02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:40.780]  broadly about this because we are looking at information warfare in this
[02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:44.580]  Trump age we didn't start with Donald Trump but clearly that's what we're
[02:51:44.580 --> 02:51:48.660]  seeing right now and people in power benefit from the kind of confusion that
[02:51:48.660 --> 02:51:53.060]  we're seeing I'm sorry the whole corporate system the mainstream media
[02:51:53.060 --> 02:51:57.020]  home of the corporate system is engaged in in manipulative deceptive info war
[02:51:57.020 --> 02:52:00.500]  they've been caught lying on every front WikiLeaks shows it and so they're
[02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:05.980]  saying they just discovered info war and the power elite are running it well
[02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:09.860]  yeah they're running a disinfo info war we're running an insurrection to restore
[02:52:09.860 --> 02:52:13.820]  the Republic and prosperity and justice in truth and exposing the whole info
[02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:18.820]  wars apparatus hence the website called info wars and 20 years after I started
[02:52:18.820 --> 02:52:22.940]  the website people finally get it but is there a hat off that I'm a visionary is
[02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:27.260]  there a hat off I did my homework is there a hat off I you know that I was
[02:52:27.260 --> 02:52:30.500]  right about the Iraq war being a lie and and right about all the other crap and
[02:52:30.500 --> 02:52:33.540]  clap the states 20 years ago now everybody knows it or this phenol a
[02:52:33.540 --> 02:52:37.340]  20 years ago now everybody knows it on on honor fluoride bad 20 years ago now
[02:52:37.340 --> 02:52:41.980]  Harvard says take it out of the water no I'm a bad Russian agent that's
[02:52:41.980 --> 02:52:44.420]  outrageous crap
[02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:49.260]  continue I mean they can take it so far here you could talk about information
[02:52:49.260 --> 02:52:52.900]  warfare you've got Alex Jones as conspiracy theorist because info wars
[02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:58.740]  show saying 9-11 was an inside job the Fort Hood students of shootings were
[02:52:58.740 --> 02:53:02.740]  staged and a lot of people listen to him this is him in August late August
[02:53:02.740 --> 02:53:06.220]  talking about people associated with Hillary Clinton he likes to say that
[02:53:06.220 --> 02:53:09.980]  died under suspicious circumstances that none of this was about facts about
[02:53:09.980 --> 02:53:14.580]  proven facts it's just outrageous assertion but these things get currency
[02:53:14.580 --> 02:53:17.580]  here's Alex Jones hate to even play it but you have to have a sense of what's
[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:22.100]  out there it would take hours the chronicle the hundreds and hundreds and
[02:53:22.100 --> 02:53:26.540]  hundreds of people that have been mysteriously murdered gunned down choked
[02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:31.300]  to death drowned cut into pieces since the Clintons were running for governor
[02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:34.820]  right through president rise in the state department of today okay I don't
[02:53:34.820 --> 02:53:41.540]  even know where to begin and there's the first time you do have to play it
[02:53:41.540 --> 02:53:45.540]  because this is slickly produced this little you know Alex Jones can look
[02:53:45.540 --> 02:53:50.180]  like CNN when he wants to he can sound like NPR when he wants to and that is
[02:53:50.180 --> 02:53:55.340]  incredibly dangerous and it goes on and on oh see all about them it's how you
[02:53:55.340 --> 02:54:02.020]  look and how you sound sleepy time yes I can do bedtime stories with mr. Rogers
[02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:08.500]  slow kids get on board the white NPR van we have free welfare free shots free
[02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:14.100]  everything just like North Korea come on along sponsored by Rockefeller Ford
[02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:20.900]  Foundation and Monsanto coming up next parents aren't needed anymore oh that's
[02:54:20.900 --> 02:54:28.380]  other conspiracy theory should I play MSNBC saying we should get around the
[02:54:28.380 --> 02:54:32.180]  idea of parents controlling their kids it's the state should I play most
[02:54:32.180 --> 02:54:35.300]  serious period nobody knows you're coming after kids this article I'm gonna

[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:06.020]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're
[02:59:06.020 --> 02:59:10.820]  dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body

[02:59:26.540 --> 02:59:31.020]  wormwood I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right

[03:00:36.820 --> 03:00:51.180]  yeah they call us walking corpses general public they call us cattle
[03:00:51.180 --> 03:00:55.700]  they'd like to lock us up with their modern prison planet put us in their
[03:00:55.700 --> 03:01:18.940]  pretty pins in the beautiful cities. I don't want to be in your British hell. Ain't no mystery all right look

[03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:35.980]  complete globalist control with no more families Germany years ago banned any new
[03:01:35.980 --> 03:01:41.780]  constructions of single-family homes the circle is now complete I'm gonna shoot a
[03:01:41.780 --> 03:01:46.940]  very special report the nightly news that will air this evening seven o'clock
[03:01:46.940 --> 03:01:54.140]  sent trial time now before I go any further Roger Stone's coming up I don't
[03:01:54.140 --> 03:01:57.700]  want to say I dropped the ball today but this article needs to go mega viral
[03:01:57.700 --> 03:02:01.220]  and I'm gonna have Paul Watson keep this up all day on info wars.com and
[03:02:01.220 --> 03:02:06.940]  prison planet.com and I'm going to read this sucker at the start of the
[03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:13.900]  broadcast tomorrow because it really is powerful to break down the ultimate
[03:02:13.900 --> 03:02:20.580]  fake news list. That's a pretty good headline but I can
[03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:25.060]  tribute the article Paul wrote most of it but I mean it's even more powerful
[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:31.460]  how do you say like list of real fake news released and surprise surprise the
[03:02:31.460 --> 03:02:36.380]  fake news put out the list of the news they claim is fake shut it down so we're
[03:02:36.380 --> 03:02:39.780]  not calling to shut down the fake news we're calling for the free speech right
[03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:43.300]  to expose them but of course the fake news once I shut down because the
[03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:47.820]  counterfeit always wants to kill the real thing politically or physically I
[03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:51.580]  experienced that like why is Glenn Beck out to get me why is he always attacking
[03:02:51.580 --> 03:02:56.940]  me starting like 10 years ago but before it was behind the scenes you don't
[03:02:56.940 --> 03:03:00.260]  give me any attention get big corporate funding put on air all this other stuff
[03:03:00.260 --> 03:03:04.380]  and finally he had so many top clear channel people and others formerly I'm
[03:03:04.380 --> 03:03:07.740]  about presidents vice presidents but people had gone to work for him as the
[03:03:07.740 --> 03:03:11.420]  years went on even when they work for him he was so mean so nasty I run into
[03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:16.580]  him in New York and stuff at like RTF events and at Fox News and stuff I mean
[03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:19.460]  some of these are household names they go man Glenn Beck thinks he's the Messiah
[03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:23.940]  and he hates you and he's got five people over at Mercury Media that are
[03:03:23.940 --> 03:03:27.220]  obsessed with you and he's got acting lessons and I did not later see this
[03:03:27.220 --> 03:03:31.060]  stuff in the news and Glenn Beck like we put on make-up he like candy butts
[03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:34.100]  around I'm not against gay people and I'm not saying he's gay but let me just
[03:03:34.100 --> 03:03:39.060]  tell you the guy is super feminine super Nellie first I've known Nellie guys
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:44.460]  that get more women than you know Errol Flynn it'll beat your ass too so this is
[03:03:44.460 --> 03:03:47.140]  somebody talks like a woman behind the scenes and walks around like this me
[03:03:47.140 --> 03:03:50.820]  maybe only their mom raised him I don't know the point is behind the scenes he
[03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:56.420]  is like hand on the head when let me tell you baby oh yeah yeah so yeah that
[03:03:56.420 --> 03:04:01.220]  that's when back he's a lesbian he's an actor he's a big liberal big abortion
[03:04:01.220 --> 03:04:04.580]  supporter a lot of other stuff and I never even went there I knew I was like

[03:08:42.180 --> 03:08:46.580]  more proud or energized by the history that's taking place I'd say seismically
[03:08:46.580 --> 03:08:49.860]  what Trump's doing is ten times what Reagan did if he delivers he's
[03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:53.780]  delivering so far taken bowing to the woodshed about double charging for a

[03:09:30.500 --> 03:09:33.460]  banning that they're talking about the new program and it's up on info wars
[03:09:33.460 --> 03:09:37.660]  dot com an article by Paul Watson and myself they need to go mega viral the
[03:09:37.660 --> 03:09:42.220]  real fake news list has been released the ultimate fake news list and we have
[03:09:42.220 --> 03:09:49.060]  a petition and a sign up for alerts on free speech and we're launching a major
[03:09:49.060 --> 03:09:52.140]  initiative to protest in New York at CNN I can now announce that Roger could
[03:09:52.140 --> 03:09:55.020]  speak to them and go to his guest and we're also gonna be I'm gonna be

[03:10:01.740 --> 03:10:06.380]  Trump Tower and to Congress and just pointing out that we don't want to be
[03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:10.340]  censored and have a new blacklist I was credit the Guardian and others have
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:13.580]  said this is horrible this is fascism Roger I know you got a bunch of guests
[03:10:13.580 --> 03:10:16.900]  lined up and a lot so you were a bit late getting in the cockpit because you
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:21.260]  were coming back from important work at Trump Tower obviously but I'll hand the
[03:10:21.260 --> 03:10:25.380]  baton to you my friend take over thank you very much Alex and thank you for
[03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:30.660]  letting me sit in here today we're you accurately it said I just rushed back
[03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:36.300]  from the tower I had the my privilege of seeing the president elect again
[03:10:36.300 --> 03:10:41.580]  yesterday Trump Tower for a short period of time and as I told you yesterday
[03:10:41.580 --> 03:10:46.700]  although I don't divulge the contents of those private conversations I can tell
[03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:52.860]  you he is upbeat optimistic having the time of his life working the phones
[03:10:52.860 --> 03:10:58.100]  like Lyndon Johnson business leaders civic leaders reaching out to people not
[03:10:58.100 --> 03:11:04.580]  in his coalition like Al Gore Al Sharpton sure for 40 years there's been a signal
[03:11:04.580 --> 03:11:09.020]  to not build here in America that signals now reversing and is dramatic
[03:11:09.020 --> 03:11:14.420]  yeah I think that the message here is simple America is open for business
[03:11:14.420 --> 03:11:19.460]  again Trump is going to trim taxes and trim regulations and trim all the
[03:11:19.460 --> 03:11:25.100]  bureaucratic red tape that has prevented that has forced businesses to
[03:11:25.100 --> 03:11:30.940]  flee this is not as you know the capitalists plan their plan is to as to
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:37.540]  destroy the u.s. job market bring us to our knees and they almost succeeded but
[03:11:37.540 --> 03:11:42.180]  for a guy named Donald John Trump
[03:11:44.380 --> 03:11:51.260]  we are a lot to cover here first of all as I came down from the tire of the
[03:11:51.260 --> 03:11:59.140]  tower and the elevators opened I was assaulted by a gaggle of reporters and
[03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:05.100]  they all wanted to know we discussed and I told them honestly that I had told
[03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:13.780]  of the book the making of the president 2016 how Donald Trump orchestrated an
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:18.780]  American Revolution and proved the mainstream media wrong quite excited
[03:12:18.780 --> 03:12:24.460]  about the book and I was asked immediately about pizza game now in all
[03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:29.980]  honesty I had been immersed in trying to finish a manuscript for a book I'm not
[03:12:29.980 --> 03:12:35.660]  all that familiar with pizza gate I have never tweeted on it for my personal
[03:12:35.660 --> 03:12:40.660]  server of my personal Twitter feed or my personal Facebook page because I'm
[03:12:40.660 --> 03:12:45.300]  it's not something motivating me at this moment some of the stone cold truth
[03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:50.020]  authors like St. John Hunt and others have been looking into it it does appear
[03:12:50.020 --> 03:12:56.860]  that code words that the FBI has said previously are used pedophilic rings
[03:12:56.860 --> 03:13:01.620]  were being used in some emails that's about what I know but that didn't stop
[03:13:01.620 --> 03:13:08.660]  some gentleman in Washington DC for claiming that I endangered the life of
[03:13:08.660 --> 03:13:14.020]  history children because of my proselytizing on this issue I guess so
[03:13:14.020 --> 03:13:20.300]  if you want fake news there's some fake news for you I then went down to the
[03:13:20.300 --> 03:13:27.580]  14th floor of the transition and I can tell you that there is an armada of
[03:13:27.580 --> 03:13:34.540]  retreads from the old Republican Party both the congressional wing of the
[03:13:34.540 --> 03:13:40.700]  party and the Romney McCain Bush burnouts who are trying to board this
[03:13:40.700 --> 03:13:48.980]  ship I saw people and heard about people that whose names I haven't heard in 25
[03:13:48.980 --> 03:13:55.660]  to 30 years these are people who did nothing whatsoever to elect Donald
[03:13:55.660 --> 03:14:02.900]  Trump and their people who don't share Donald Trump's values they disagree with
[03:14:02.900 --> 03:14:07.780]  them on trade they disagree with them on monetary policy they disagree with them
[03:14:07.780 --> 03:14:15.260]  on immigration yet they seek glory and titles and then you have kind of a
[03:14:15.260 --> 03:14:21.940]  jockeying among the billionaires who some of whom were financially supportive
[03:14:21.940 --> 03:14:28.540]  small handful of Donald's personal friends but by and large this campaign was
[03:14:28.540 --> 03:14:34.860]  not funded with that cap money yeah this was funded with small donations and
[03:14:34.860 --> 03:14:39.700]  therefore there's not a long line of billionaires waiting for government
[03:14:39.700 --> 03:14:45.700]  positions I think merit is going to play some role in Donald Trump's final
[03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:56.980]  decisions but I have seen this co-option of the revolution and it was
[03:14:56.980 --> 03:15:01.460]  when Ronald Reagan was elected I was in the transition and then suddenly the
[03:15:01.460 --> 03:15:05.340]  bushite boarding party showed up in force we saw we found people like
[03:15:05.340 --> 03:15:12.380]  Malcolm Baldrige a Yale classmate of poppies George HW Bush as our commerce
[03:15:12.380 --> 03:15:18.660]  secretary Jim Baker a friend of mine a very capable man a guy who has
[03:15:18.660 --> 03:15:23.100]  certainly aided my career when he got governor probably President Ronald
[03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:28.740]  Reagan to endorse Governor Tom Kane then candidate for Governor Tom Kane in New
[03:15:28.740 --> 03:15:35.540]  Jersey but nonetheless a globalist a bushite that's the fact so Trump must
[03:15:35.540 --> 03:15:42.420]  resist this armada now I heard that Sean Spicer from the Republican National
[03:15:42.420 --> 03:15:49.900]  Committee was going to be the the press secretary for the president and I find
[03:15:49.900 --> 03:15:54.740]  this perplexing because I remember when Mr. Spicer said publicly I believe it
[03:15:54.740 --> 03:16:01.700]  was in September that if candidate Trump does not improve his polling numbers
[03:16:01.700 --> 03:16:07.340]  well then the Republican National Committee would withdraw its support
[03:16:07.340 --> 03:16:15.180]  this is extraordinary because the Republican National Chairman serves at
[03:16:15.180 --> 03:16:20.900]  the pleasure of the nominee for president it has always been thus
[03:16:20.900 --> 03:16:27.220]  Brian's previous is the first national chairman who lost an election in the
[03:16:27.220 --> 03:16:34.780]  ignominious defeat of Mitt Romney to be retained for four more years unheard of
[03:16:34.780 --> 03:16:44.700]  rewarding failure yet Spicer has was never chastised the idea of the chairman
[03:16:44.700 --> 03:16:51.020]  pulling the rug out from under a presidential candidate this is unheard of
[03:16:51.020 --> 03:16:59.500]  Richard Nixon would roll in his grave why not Laura Ingram why not Monica
[03:16:59.500 --> 03:17:05.420]  Crowley why not Jason Miller who did I think a good job as Donald Trump's
[03:17:05.420 --> 03:17:11.860]  press spokesman during the campaign so I think there are options of people who
[03:17:11.860 --> 03:17:16.300]  supported the president I understand that the president elect is building a
[03:17:16.300 --> 03:17:21.340]  coalition and I think one of Ronald Reagan's great strengths was that he did
[03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:27.300]  reach out to the Bush people the Howard Baker people the John Connolly people
[03:17:27.300 --> 03:17:33.540]  Jim Brady who was almost fatally wounded and badly wounded in the
[03:17:33.540 --> 03:17:46.020]  assassination on Trump is is was a Connolly associate in any event put to
[03:17:46.020 --> 03:17:52.500]  Charles Ortell who is one of the most brilliant people I met during the the
[03:17:52.500 --> 03:18:00.140]  2016 campaign he is a wizard of Wall Street a guy who understands corporate
[03:18:00.140 --> 03:18:06.860]  finance and the charitable realm and his work at Charles Ortell com plays a key
[03:18:06.860 --> 03:18:12.740]  role in our understanding of the Clinton Foundation scandals so Charles
[03:18:12.740 --> 03:18:16.580]  welcome to the show and I'm sorry for our delay but I had a lot to get off my
[03:18:16.580 --> 03:18:23.340]  chest there no thanks so much for having me on Roger so Charles the president
[03:18:23.340 --> 03:18:27.880]  elect comes out says the Clintons should not be prosecuted I know that you
[03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:34.980]  have have a great understanding of their crimes what's your take well actually
[03:18:34.980 --> 03:18:38.380]  what he said was very clever he said that he didn't believe there should be a
[03:18:38.380 --> 03:18:43.260]  new investigation opened into Hillary Clinton's potential abuses that's a very
[03:18:43.260 --> 03:18:47.700]  different thing than saying you know that the ongoing investigations which I
[03:18:47.700 --> 03:18:53.580]  understand to be legion inside the US and now outside the US he expressed no
[03:18:53.580 --> 03:18:57.980]  view on whether those investigations should proceed and indeed that's a proper
[03:18:57.980 --> 03:19:10.140]  approach to take the president the president of the United States of
[03:19:10.140 --> 03:19:15.380]  America so I wasn't disheartened at all by that comment well it's interesting to
[03:19:15.380 --> 03:19:20.020]  me also that I heard that the president elect will ask all of the foreign
[03:19:20.020 --> 03:19:24.820]  nations who are our allies to release any relevant documents regarding the
[03:19:24.820 --> 03:19:31.180]  Clinton Foundation I am also quite interested I'm sure you are to see what
[03:19:31.180 --> 03:19:39.740]  is in the 650,000 new emails in the Huma Abedin Anthony Weiner trove it was
[03:19:39.740 --> 03:19:44.740]  interesting to me Charles how many of the WikiLeaks merely confirmed your
[03:19:44.740 --> 03:19:49.980]  original work taking into the Clinton Foundation well thank you for bringing it
[03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:54.620]  up but actually Roger you know what's going on here is that there are
[03:19:54.620 --> 03:19:59.020]  taxpayers in a lot of governments a lot of countries around the world who
[03:19:59.020 --> 03:20:03.140]  stand in some I want to tell you about a brand-new often read product it's a
[03:20:03.140 --> 03:20:06.540]  pocket-sized solar generator even though it's so small you can put it in your
[03:20:06.540 --> 03:20:11.020]  pocket it can actually run some 110 appliances at your house like small

[03:24:21.940 --> 03:24:36.500]  I am sitting in from New York and honored to be here with my friend Alex
[03:24:36.500 --> 03:24:41.980]  Jones who is just the party the role that he played as an MVP and the role
[03:24:41.980 --> 03:24:48.040]  that info wars played in this most recent election is so terrifying to the
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:53.900]  left that now they're preparing a 1950s type blacklist they're they want
[03:24:53.900 --> 03:24:59.580]  censorship you see set liberals love free speech as long as it's theirs we're
[03:24:59.580 --> 03:25:04.020]  gonna go back to Charles or tell because we had some technical problems our
[03:25:04.020 --> 03:25:07.700]  ending I didn't really have the opportunity I wanted to have Charles
[03:25:07.700 --> 03:25:11.500]  where do you think the investigations into the Clinton Foundation and their
[03:25:11.500 --> 03:25:18.460]  other foibles go from here well I think what's gonna happen is that Donald Trump's
[03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:26.460]  administration will rightly wait until 1201 on January 20th when his full team
[03:25:26.460 --> 03:25:31.060]  will begin to have controls over the Justice Department over the IRS over
[03:25:31.060 --> 03:25:36.380]  the various regulatory bodies the FTC and we'll be able to look on the inside
[03:25:36.380 --> 03:25:41.500]  with subpoena power at the massive evidence inside and outside this country
[03:25:41.500 --> 03:25:45.860]  of all the charities connected to the Clinton Foundation and it's not simply
[03:25:45.860 --> 03:25:50.580]  the library archive out there in Little Rock it's a vast web of charities
[03:25:50.580 --> 03:25:54.860]  with the name in it of charities who's you wouldn't even think out of
[03:25:54.860 --> 03:25:58.820]  connection to the Clinton Foundation but do and so I would suspect he's gonna
[03:25:58.820 --> 03:26:03.580]  empower or the Justice Department the IRS will be empowered to take this
[03:26:03.580 --> 03:26:07.820]  investigation where it really needs to go and it's gonna take some months to
[03:26:07.820 --> 03:26:11.660]  actually go through all this record during which time I would guess the
[03:26:11.660 --> 03:26:14.800]  administration will be focused on positive changes that will help all
[03:26:14.800 --> 03:26:19.700]  Americans this will just bubble along until it reaches a public domain later
[03:26:19.700 --> 03:26:25.620]  this next year I think that's a good analysis Charles I mean it just seems
[03:26:25.620 --> 03:26:31.940]  to me that this may be Donald Trump with a shrewd piece of pardon insurance I
[03:26:31.940 --> 03:26:37.380]  mean if you announced your intentions today to enforce the law and to
[03:26:37.380 --> 03:26:42.820]  investigate long-doing obviously Barack Obama would have an enormous
[03:26:42.820 --> 03:26:49.380]  incentive to pardon Hillary Bill and Chelsea and a probably a slew of their
[03:26:49.380 --> 03:26:54.460]  flunkies and based on the historic precedent that set by Gerald Ford in the
[03:26:54.460 --> 03:27:00.940]  Nixon pardon the Clintons can be pardoned for crimes that have not even yet
[03:27:00.940 --> 03:27:07.940]  been identified any crime they have or may have committed so well and the
[03:27:07.940 --> 03:27:12.700]  Obama's in the Clintons while they do not see eye to eye they have too much on
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:19.180]  each other and therefore I suspect that they would do so now Obama doesn't want
[03:27:19.180 --> 03:27:23.500]  to do that because it doesn't want it to be his legacy plus he doesn't like the
[03:27:23.500 --> 03:27:31.660]  Clintons anyway but I think as we learn more from the 650,000 Huma Abedin emails
[03:27:31.660 --> 03:27:39.420]  when entirely new crimes are brought to the fore or when additional evidence of
[03:27:39.420 --> 03:27:45.260]  crimes that you Charles have already identified are confirmed yet again as
[03:27:45.260 --> 03:27:51.060]  they were at WikiLeaks well I think they could be in deep trouble
[03:27:51.060 --> 03:27:56.580]  well three quick points Roger the first is that the president can only
[03:27:56.580 --> 03:28:01.500]  pardon certain federal crimes obviously he could not pardon impeachment there are
[03:28:01.500 --> 03:28:05.660]  lots of state-informed crimes here that the President of the United States has
[03:28:05.660 --> 03:28:11.180]  no power to pardon and beyond that were the president of President Obama to
[03:28:11.180 --> 03:28:15.860]  pardon the questions how many of the team can he actually pardon for
[03:28:15.860 --> 03:28:19.460]  federal crimes could he pardon all the lawyers and account to trustees and
[03:28:19.460 --> 03:28:23.780]  executives I don't think so and he hasn't raised very much money for his own
[03:28:23.780 --> 03:28:30.660]  foundation we saw how pardoning did not help Bill Clinton raise the money for
[03:28:30.660 --> 03:28:34.980]  his foundation when he pardoned Mark Rich so I'm not so sure the pardon is
[03:28:34.980 --> 03:28:41.980]  going to be effective right here well I'm not an attorney but I do I'll defer
[03:28:41.980 --> 03:28:45.740]  you on the analysis I think you're right about the foreign crimes look I think
[03:28:45.740 --> 03:28:50.940]  the Clinton's crimes include treason I mean there is no question that Bill
[03:28:50.940 --> 03:28:57.380]  Clinton sold missile guidance targeting guidance technology to the red Chinese
[03:28:57.380 --> 03:29:03.820]  for $300,000 in Chinese funny money which is a pit and there are similar
[03:29:03.820 --> 03:29:09.980]  transactions with the Russians one of the most tiring canards of this last
[03:29:09.980 --> 03:29:14.980]  election was this constant idea that if you were for Donald Trump and you were
[03:29:14.980 --> 03:29:20.660]  in favor of thermonuclear war with the Russians over Syria well then you must
[03:29:20.660 --> 03:29:26.220]  be a Russian agent in fact we know do we not that it's the Clinton's who did
[03:29:26.220 --> 03:29:33.500]  commerce with the clique around including Frank Justra and the famous
[03:29:33.500 --> 03:29:39.460]  uranium deal which is still boggles the mind can you run us through that yeah I
[03:29:39.460 --> 03:29:46.740]  mean basically while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State the people who held
[03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:53.140]  the powers of in our federal government to approach the empires on the run Alex
[03:29:53.140 --> 03:30:03.380]  Jones and the GCN radio network BuzzFeed says white people are a plague to the
[03:30:03.380 --> 03:30:09.140]  planet in a listicle published on Monday BuzzFeed ran insulting and racist
[03:30:09.140 --> 03:30:13.820]  messages towards white people many of the presentations included hate speech
[03:30:13.820 --> 03:30:19.780]  such as how white people plagued society white people are crazy and white
[03:30:19.780 --> 03:30:24.060]  people are a plague to the planet meanwhile an image is featured of the
[03:30:24.060 --> 03:30:29.540]  presenter who is a young woman wearing a make America brown again t-shirt and
[03:30:29.540 --> 03:30:34.420]  earlier this year BuzzFeed also produced a video on YouTube that shamed white
[03:30:34.420 --> 03:30:39.940]  people for being arrogant controlling and selfish entitled people of color from
[03:30:39.940 --> 03:30:44.580]  around the world respond to white the clip is a three-minute guilt trip
[03:30:44.580 --> 03:30:49.580]  intended to shame Caucasians into acknowledging how impressive they are

[03:33:29.140 --> 03:33:37.220]  welcome back to info wars we are the resistance how to be here now we have a
[03:33:37.220 --> 03:33:44.340]  rock icon a guy that I've listened to since he's he was with the McCoys in the
[03:33:44.340 --> 03:33:51.100]  epic hit hang on sloopy knocked off the charts only by the Beatles and during the
[03:33:51.100 --> 03:33:57.020]  campaign I put it up a tweet when Bruce Springsteen endorsed Hillary Clinton
[03:33:57.020 --> 03:34:03.180]  saying Bruce Springsteen hell we've got Rick Derringer is Rick Derringer
[03:34:03.180 --> 03:34:09.700]  actively supported Donald Trump and I have been catching up on him via the
[03:34:09.700 --> 03:34:15.740]  internet ever since now he's a Grammy Award winner everybody knows rock and
[03:34:15.740 --> 03:34:20.700]  roll whoo-chee-coo one of the great pot boilers of all time welcome to info wars
[03:34:20.700 --> 03:34:28.140]  Rick Derringer hey it's gonna be fun I'm really honored that you're here today
[03:34:28.140 --> 03:34:34.820]  I know Alex is excited about it and I know you are a vocal Trump supporter
[03:34:34.820 --> 03:34:39.780]  and people wouldn't expect that because I guess they think that you can't be a
[03:34:39.780 --> 03:34:45.100]  conservative or a libertarian or a liberty-oriented individual and know
[03:34:45.100 --> 03:34:50.300]  how to rock out which is entirely wrong watch Lee Atwater's guitar playing
[03:34:50.300 --> 03:34:57.220]  sometime so what what brought you to Donald Trump there he is well you know
[03:34:57.220 --> 03:35:02.380]  it might have been partly because we don't watch TV my wife and I don't
[03:35:02.380 --> 03:35:08.300]  really have even our terrestrial TV stuff hooked up we watch computer we
[03:35:08.300 --> 03:35:17.300]  watch internet via the computer sometimes we use the Apple TV to project it on
[03:35:17.300 --> 03:35:22.700]  our big screen back there somewhere there it is but we don't use terrestrial TV
[03:35:22.700 --> 03:35:28.740]  so I never saw Donald Trump going your fired and and all that stuff I think
[03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:34.460]  some people took him lightly because they only remembered seeing like TV shows
[03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:39.620]  and things but I never saw them so I just knew him from what he promised to do
[03:35:39.620 --> 03:35:44.740]  and to me I said man I always tell people I'm not a Republican or
[03:35:44.740 --> 03:35:51.260]  necessarily a Democrat I'm a pragmatist I want see things get done and he
[03:35:51.260 --> 03:35:56.060]  promised when you go down the list ripped very early in his candidacy he
[03:35:56.060 --> 03:36:03.620]  promised all the things that I want to have done well I'm glad you had the
[03:36:03.620 --> 03:36:08.340]  opportunity to be here because I saw that you played with Johnny and Edgar
[03:36:08.340 --> 03:36:15.020]  Wincher two of the greatest blues artists of all time and that alone just
[03:36:15.020 --> 03:36:21.140]  blows me away and now you're about to start a new tour but before we get to
[03:36:21.140 --> 03:36:26.940]  that you were rewriting a special song for Donald Trump your real American
[03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:33.500]  anthem I understand is gonna have a have kind of a touch up well real
[03:36:33.500 --> 03:36:39.340]  American was written in the 80s and I just wanted to write the most patriotic
[03:36:39.340 --> 03:36:45.940]  song of all time very simple Hulk Hogan heard it in the midst of a project I was
[03:36:45.940 --> 03:36:50.420]  working on with the World Wrestling Federation and he decided that he wanted
[03:36:50.420 --> 03:36:55.700]  it to be his theme song well I shouldn't be something to complain about but on
[03:36:55.700 --> 03:37:04.500]  the other hand somehow it diminished the real American authenticity the
[03:37:04.500 --> 03:37:10.700]  patriotic theme somehow it it wasn't how I expected to see the song used but he
[03:37:10.700 --> 03:37:16.220]  used it and continued to use it till today and then all of a sudden Hillary
[03:37:16.220 --> 03:37:21.980]  Clinton was running in a primary against Barack Obama and I saw her come up on
[03:37:21.980 --> 03:37:28.300]  stage somewhere and she had I'm a real American played well whether or not you
[03:37:28.300 --> 03:37:33.740]  like Hillary Clinton I as a songwriter said man that's where I expected to see
[03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:39.060]  that song all along with with legitimate status associated with it then
[03:37:39.060 --> 03:37:47.100]  Newt Gingrich won his primary he used it and then people were complaining about
[03:37:47.100 --> 03:37:51.780]  Barack Obama not having a birth certificate so they made him a birth
[03:37:51.780 --> 03:37:59.300]  certificate and at the correspondence dinner that year they had a big video
[03:37:59.300 --> 03:38:04.820]  showing they created a video with my song real American again and every time
[03:38:04.820 --> 03:38:09.260]  the guitar riff played his birth certificate would bounce in and out of the screen along
[03:38:09.260 --> 03:38:13.100]  with the guitar riff and I thought that was pretty cool once again can't get
[03:38:13.100 --> 03:38:17.660]  much better than the president using your stuff that got over 11 million hits at
[03:38:17.660 --> 03:38:22.700]  that time then they took it down feeling like we might after we might come
[03:38:22.700 --> 03:38:28.260]  after some money so since then it's gotten another 11 or 12 million hits then
[03:38:28.260 --> 03:38:35.740]  they used it a winner on America's Got Talent I believe a guy balanced 26
[03:38:35.740 --> 03:38:41.940]  watermelons on his head and they played it for his victory song then to make me
[03:38:41.940 --> 03:38:47.020]  the happiest of all I heard that Donald Trump was using it for his entrance song
[03:38:47.020 --> 03:38:53.420]  then subsequent to that I've seen about four videos some made in the Trump camp
[03:38:53.420 --> 03:38:59.600]  and some from other sources but they all use my song real American well real
[03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:05.660]  American is a song from the 80s and every time I hear that version I'm
[03:39:05.660 --> 03:39:11.060]  starting to more and more go that sounds like the 80s it really doesn't sound
[03:39:11.060 --> 03:39:16.780]  like today and for a song that's never been released as a single to have this
[03:39:16.780 --> 03:39:22.380]  amazing huge success I think it's just begging for a single release so what we
[03:39:22.380 --> 03:39:29.060]  plan to do I know Barack Obama razzed Trump a little bit for using his song I
[03:39:29.060 --> 03:39:33.700]  thought that was pretty funny Rick Derringer's real American is what they
[03:39:33.700 --> 03:39:38.320]  said in the column that I read but he was razzing Donald Trump I said well
[03:39:38.320 --> 03:39:42.700]  here's two reasons we have we should get a new version of this song out there
[03:39:42.700 --> 03:39:46.100]  because it should be a single people should be able to buy it which they
[03:39:46.100 --> 03:39:53.340]  really can't now very easily and also if we had a brand new version Trump could
[03:39:53.340 --> 03:40:01.060]  actually go to Obama and say hey how dare you call real American by Rick
[03:40:01.060 --> 03:40:07.420]  Derringer your song when I have a brand new real American that Rick Derringer
[03:40:07.420 --> 03:40:14.020]  made especially with this in mind well the songs had a rich political history
[03:40:14.020 --> 03:40:19.740]  that was extraordinary now I hope they can get you to Washington at the time
[03:40:19.740 --> 03:40:24.940]  of the inauguration I have noticed I have noticed that most of the inaugural
[03:40:24.940 --> 03:40:31.060]  activities are shall we say designed for the much wealthier class there needs to
[03:40:31.060 --> 03:40:36.940]  be a people's inaugural because this is a people's victory something that either
[03:40:36.940 --> 03:40:44.460]  oh cost or about this free yeah I'd love to do it I mean I'm one of your
[03:40:44.460 --> 03:40:49.660]  associates contacted me and said that he was interested in January 20th in
[03:40:49.660 --> 03:40:55.260]  Washington DC and I said well I'm there I actually have a cruise rock and roll
[03:40:55.260 --> 03:41:01.540]  legends cruise scheduled from January 18th through the 21st so I told him at
[03:41:01.540 --> 03:41:08.220]  that time that man I want to I would gladly cancel that cruise if we can
[03:41:08.220 --> 03:41:13.220]  work out the details to go to Washington DC so that's kind of where we are now I
[03:41:13.220 --> 03:41:19.140]  know people are saying a would cost quite a bit of money because you had to
[03:41:19.140 --> 03:41:23.500]  cancel the cruise and they're talking on that level but I'm gonna let those
[03:41:23.500 --> 03:41:26.940]  people go ahead with those kind of discussions and I'm just gonna leave it
[03:41:26.940 --> 03:41:32.340]  you know we we want to do it my wife by the way really inspired this new version
[03:41:32.340 --> 03:41:39.100]  of real American she's here somewhere gender are you here there she is let's
[03:41:39.100 --> 03:41:43.260]  get her in here too because she really came up with the great idea to redo it
[03:41:43.260 --> 03:41:50.300]  and a specific way to do it this is Jenda Jenda welcome to info wars thank
[03:41:50.300 --> 03:41:55.620]  you thank you good to be here well we're we are really hoping that you'll be able
[03:41:55.620 --> 03:42:01.300]  to play the the new version that that she inspired in Washington the question
[03:42:01.300 --> 03:42:06.980]  is one of venue the federal park service pretty much has any public property in
[03:42:06.980 --> 03:42:12.820]  DC and now we have learned even on the banks of the Potomac lockdown so we're
[03:42:12.820 --> 03:42:18.700]  looking for a location trust me Rick if you're there with this song and Donald
[03:42:18.700 --> 03:42:24.420]  Trump's spirit and Alex Jones who's anchoring to come your song will be heard
[03:42:24.420 --> 03:42:30.060]  loud and clear and we'll have the people that I assure you of but there's a lot
[03:42:30.060 --> 03:42:34.820]  of politics involved tight lockdown by the security services but I'm still
[03:42:34.820 --> 03:42:39.580]  hopeful that this will come together maybe well maybe faster than the Trump
[03:42:39.580 --> 03:42:44.940]  cabinet so let's say you never know I'd love to get this thing finished in time
[03:42:44.940 --> 03:42:51.420]  to actually be able to play it for him or or have his people use it at the
[03:42:51.420 --> 03:42:56.700]  inauguration whether I'm there or not in fact we could promise you Roger Stone
[03:42:56.700 --> 03:43:03.820]  and exclusive for a few weeks before it's released in the nation well I'll
[03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:07.900]  talk to Alex info wars I'm sure we'll want in on that because it's amazing how
[03:43:07.900 --> 03:43:12.620]  many rockers watch info wars I can't walk around the streets of New York or
[03:43:12.620 --> 03:43:17.340]  Washington or Miami and people come up to me and say that they're tuned in to the
[03:43:17.340 --> 03:43:23.860]  new revolution we we I was aggravated I'm not a spring steen fan so that's why
[03:43:23.860 --> 03:43:29.780]  I put up that tweet and it got a lot of retweets but I feel strongly about it
[03:43:29.780 --> 03:43:37.100]  you know it was it was too politically correct for me just to point to me when
[03:43:37.100 --> 03:43:43.260]  I saw this stuff going on last year in North Carolina with bathroom issues and
[03:43:43.260 --> 03:43:47.500]  stuff and all of a sudden Bruce Springsteen was one of the first people
[03:43:47.500 --> 03:43:52.300]  to cancel his concert and then came you to and and the list went on and on I
[03:43:52.300 --> 03:43:56.500]  spoke to my agent at that time and I said here's what I want you to do every
[03:43:56.500 --> 03:44:00.060]  one of these artists whether it's a Rolling Stones or Bruce Springsteen that
[03:44:00.060 --> 03:44:03.860]  cancels the concert I want you to call North Carolina that promoter and say
[03:44:03.860 --> 03:44:09.580]  Rick Derringer will be there because it's crazy you know the the way some
[03:44:09.580 --> 03:44:16.700]  people on the left think is just nuts well I'm predicting that you're gonna
[03:44:16.700 --> 03:44:20.940]  get an enormous career boost out of this I mean you're already a giant you've
[03:44:20.940 --> 03:44:25.340]  already got a song in the Hall of Fame but the fact that you've had the courage
[03:44:25.340 --> 03:44:30.900]  as an artist to step out and just stick to your convictions knowing of the
[03:44:30.900 --> 03:44:35.900]  Hollywood entertainment world blacklist against those who are not politically
[03:44:35.900 --> 03:44:41.060]  correct about those who won't submit themselves to that group thing you know
[03:44:41.060 --> 03:44:46.780]  I salute I salute you for that alone it goes all the way to us specifically my
[03:44:46.780 --> 03:44:55.780]  agent told me just last week that during the Trump Candice the C we had to we
[03:44:55.780 --> 03:45:01.420]  had several promoters actually cancel concerts that we had booked because it
[03:45:01.420 --> 03:45:08.340]  became clear to them that I was a Trump fan yeah the intolerance of the left is
[03:45:08.340 --> 03:45:14.700]  extraordinary they want to censor us now they're their apoplectic but because
[03:45:14.700 --> 03:45:20.140]  Trump won with your support and the support of Info Wars and Breitbart
[03:45:20.140 --> 03:45:27.100]  News and Daily Caller and other conservative alternative media outlets
[03:45:27.100 --> 03:45:32.260]  they're apoplectic because the tipping point has been matched wow you're a
[03:45:32.260 --> 03:45:37.780]  lucky lucky man today by the way is my wedding anniversary so I don't know how
[03:45:37.780 --> 03:45:44.780]  I didn't know how you feel fortunately that's great thank you my wife is in
[03:45:44.780 --> 03:45:50.540]  Miami and I am in New York but I will be back we're in Sarasota we're in
[03:45:50.540 --> 03:45:55.820]  Sarasota Florida today that's well I shall let's drive let's kind of meet in the
[03:45:55.820 --> 03:46:00.060]  middle someplace for dinner that would be great it's great to know that an
[03:46:00.060 --> 03:46:07.180]  artist is a supporter of liberty you know it is so annoying in New York
[03:46:07.180 --> 03:46:16.140]  where literally groups of children are you know 1415 are parading in the
[03:46:16.140 --> 03:46:21.860]  streets chanting over and over again F. Donald Trump F. Donald Trump however
[03:46:21.860 --> 03:46:28.780]  they're using the entire word you know we always supported together so we
[03:46:28.780 --> 03:46:33.780]  never had the division like so many American families did we saw families
[03:46:33.780 --> 03:46:41.620]  break up marriages break up everything even you know distant family even get
[03:46:41.620 --> 03:46:47.980]  more distant from the campaign you're talking you're talking to a man who has
[03:46:47.980 --> 03:46:55.140]  to move out of his New York apartment because my landlord refuses to renew my
[03:46:55.140 --> 03:47:01.300]  lease because I am for worked for and supported Donald Trump now that's not
[03:47:01.300 --> 03:47:05.660]  the reason they give you but one of my neighbors overheard the landlord say
[03:47:05.660 --> 03:47:12.220]  this they say that I play music late at night Rick Derringer by the way and they
[03:47:12.220 --> 03:47:16.420]  say that I don't garbage down the staircase look it's all nonsense it's
[03:47:16.420 --> 03:47:22.700]  not correct it's going wild he used to listen to rush who played all right from
[03:47:22.700 --> 03:47:26.020]  rock and roll who to cue for years and years when he came back I'm not
[03:47:26.020 --> 03:47:29.540]  endorsing rush we don't listen to him but he started listening to back and I
[03:47:29.540 --> 03:47:33.780]  said after two years in the kitchen listening to that loud every morning I
[03:47:33.780 --> 03:47:39.420]  said for the last year of it get off get off now I can't take it I can't take it
[03:47:39.420 --> 03:47:43.980]  you know and not that I didn't like him as a person or whatever but he showed
[03:47:43.980 --> 03:47:48.740]  his right I finally said here listen to this guy and it was Alex Jones and now
[03:47:48.740 --> 03:47:54.140]  he got hooked totally on you guys so now I'm like oh no now he's too hooked on
[03:47:54.140 --> 03:47:59.540]  someone else but he's like that at least he's like a fan now and and that's how
[03:47:59.540 --> 03:48:06.460]  he came to be here today Alex Jones is the real deal and sadly and I wrote
[03:48:06.460 --> 03:48:10.780]  about this with a daily caller I think Glenn Beck's support of Ted Cruz and
[03:48:10.780 --> 03:48:16.820]  his vicious attacks on Trump were caused by some financial angels for Ted
[03:48:16.820 --> 03:48:22.660]  Cruz bailing it out financially anyway I think we got to go here in a second
[03:48:22.660 --> 03:48:28.140]  let's let's wrap this up I'm really honored that you joined us today I'm

[03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:17.220]  Soros's money to pet play with in the last election utilizing his phony front
[03:56:17.220 --> 03:56:23.620]  organizations media matters for America a group of twisted misfits who excused

[03:56:53.580 --> 03:57:00.380]  torrent of lies on Twitter and Facebook and in social media if I were Soros I'd
[03:57:00.380 --> 03:57:07.180]  want my money back Brock was actively mixing nonprofit funds with hard
[03:57:07.180 --> 03:57:13.660]  political dollars he was paying kickbacks he was laundering money and of course he
