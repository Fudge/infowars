[00:00.000 --> 00:07.040]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here, but I'll say
[00:08.080 --> 00:10.080]  That the press is not the enemy of the people
[00:21.360 --> 00:26.880]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people the press is not the enemy of the people
[00:26.880 --> 00:30.640]  The press is not the enemy of the people
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.000]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.520]  Fake news, maybe we should go out all all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant. We're not the enemy of the people
[01:03.520 --> 01:18.960]  We're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy of the people we're not the enemy of the people
[01:26.640 --> 01:28.640]  This is CNN
[01:28.640 --> 01:35.680]  And now President Trump is calling out the media
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.920]  Not only on his Twitter, but in live interviews
[01:43.760 --> 01:46.920]  Saying they only have their hatred and
[01:47.440 --> 01:52.920]  Anti-Trump anti-American agenda welcome into the Alex Jones show Owens Royer filling in for Alex Jones
[01:52.920 --> 01:58.200]  We will be hearing from Alex in the second segment is going to be addressing
[01:59.720 --> 02:01.000]  the
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  social media campaign to censor
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.280]  Conservative speech and more importantly censor
[02:06.840 --> 02:12.360]  President Trump from getting his message out that needs to get to the president's desk and
[02:12.360 --> 02:21.640]  Yesterday, I believe it was President Trump tweeted out the hashtag stop the bias video on his Twitter account, which
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.120]  I think people now need to make trend by doing what Jack Passovic did
[02:29.160 --> 02:31.160]  And you go on Twitter
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.080]  And for example, he did Breitbart is
[02:36.600 --> 02:39.080]  Or you can do info wars is
[02:39.080 --> 02:43.480]  Or you could do Donald Trump is and look at all
[02:44.440 --> 02:49.320]  The auto finish results that come up when you put that into the search bar
[02:49.960 --> 02:52.600]  Now you do that you take screenshots
[02:53.160 --> 03:00.360]  You show how Google is bias and then you tweet those screenshot images out with hashtag stop the bias
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.840]  And that's what president Trump should have done as the next level of the video he tweeted out about
[03:06.840 --> 03:08.840]  Google's bias
[03:09.400 --> 03:15.880]  But this is where we pick up the slack for the president and have his back. So just like Jack Passovic did you need to go
[03:16.840 --> 03:18.840]  Get on the Google SEO
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.840]  In the search bar search Alex Jones is info wars is
[03:26.200 --> 03:31.000]  Donald Trump is whatever whatever you want to search and then look at the results
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.400]  And you'll probably get the same results that Jack Passovic got, which is
[03:35.960 --> 03:41.880]  Google's auto finish search results are totally biased against conservatives against gun owners
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.120]  against Donald Trump and alternative news
[03:47.560 --> 03:49.720]  So this is all going to be
[03:50.600 --> 03:57.000]  Broken down by Alex Jones in the next segment, but this is how the Democrats are
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.080]  Planning to steal the midterm elections. Now. I think that they've underestimated the power of the American people
[04:03.640 --> 04:05.640]  and the
[04:06.040 --> 04:08.440]  Power of the real world the 3d realm
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.600]  So I don't think they're going to have the results they want, but their plan is to censor conservative speech
[04:15.240 --> 04:21.160]  censor republicans on social media rig search results so that the neutral
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  Intrigued person
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.640]  Intrigued person by the upcoming elections will go and search things and they won't see the full story
[04:31.720 --> 04:35.480]  They will only see the liberal bias. They will only see the democrat bias
[04:35.640 --> 04:40.040]  They will only see the stories that tell you trump is a racist. They will only see the stories that tell you
[04:40.600 --> 04:43.400]  Trump is a racist not the stories that tell you
[04:44.200 --> 04:46.200]  record low black unemployment
[04:46.600 --> 04:48.440]  Not the stories that tell you
[04:48.440 --> 04:50.440]  Kanye west
[04:50.440 --> 04:57.400]  Going on a popular radio radio show saying trump wants to be the best president ever for black americans
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.040]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue
[05:04.360 --> 05:11.000]  Info wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet shower and sink in your home

[05:59.480 --> 06:09.880]  From the front lines of the information war, it's alex jones
[06:15.240 --> 06:19.640]  I am extremely honored to be here with you today history is happening
[06:20.280 --> 06:22.520]  Free humanity is reawakening
[06:23.320 --> 06:27.880]  president trump art champion of nationalism and free market
[06:27.880 --> 06:33.960]  And free will is now activated. He is now awake and he is now at war
[06:34.680 --> 06:43.640]  With big tech that is the heart of the eugenesis anti-human deep state anti-family anti-man anti-woman anti-child
[06:45.080 --> 06:50.200]  And just last night he put out a new viral video with millions and millions of views
[06:50.200 --> 06:57.080]  That is simply 30 seconds long showing how google covered every state of the union on their front page of obama
[06:57.320 --> 07:03.960]  But did not cover trump's state of the union. It's the same over and over again like they removed christian holidays from their own
[07:06.520 --> 07:08.680]  Menus from their own calendars and so did apple
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.400]  They act in unison tim cook what met with obama and then with hillary and then with the democrats and they admit the whole
[07:15.800 --> 07:17.800]  Censorship plan, but oh
[07:17.800 --> 07:20.280]  Cnn claims that it's all debunked
[07:21.160 --> 07:26.760]  Cnn claims nobody censoring conservatives conservatives are experiencing the shadow bands
[07:27.560 --> 07:29.560]  They're experiencing it all
[07:30.440 --> 07:35.480]  So let's go to it. Let's go to this visual piece. I'll describe it for radio listeners
[07:36.440 --> 07:42.040]  Where president trump breaks down how they don't even cover his state of the union on the front page of
[07:42.760 --> 07:44.760]  Google that helps censor china
[07:44.760 --> 07:51.240]  That is so authoritarian. It uses liberalism as the camouflage for the hardcore corporate bloodthirsty fascist
[07:51.800 --> 07:53.800]  They are here it is
[07:54.520 --> 07:57.240]  For years google promoted president obama's state of the union
[07:58.200 --> 08:00.200]  When president trump took office google stopped
[08:01.560 --> 08:07.000]  And there it is screenshots year after year 2012 2013 fullscreen 2014
[08:07.480 --> 08:09.000]  2015
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.520]  2016
[08:10.520 --> 08:12.520]  2017 it stops
[08:12.520 --> 08:14.520]  2017 it stops
[08:15.640 --> 08:17.640]  2018 it stops
[08:19.480 --> 08:24.440]  So I love how they've jumped the sharks here saying no one's being censored when it's all admitted
[08:24.920 --> 08:29.480]  I love how they're playing these games now because there's no putting this back in the bottle
[08:30.360 --> 08:34.360]  The toothpaste doesn't go back on the tube like roger stone says the cows don't come back
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.680]  The horses don't come back the trains don't come back mama dad. She don't come back
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.520]  Google is in the wiki leaks
[08:43.960 --> 08:47.080]  Bragging how they've delivered the election to hillary
[08:49.960 --> 08:52.600]  They're they're bragging how they delivered to obama
[08:53.160 --> 08:57.400]  And they got butthurt with all their gaming in 2016 when it didn't work
[08:58.040 --> 09:06.440]  So now everything is about proving how they're the kingpins and they're helping all these other countries suppress from sweden to brazil to
[09:06.440 --> 09:12.440]  Uh south africa helping suppress nationalist patriots. You name it. It's sick
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.840]  And you know, I did a video on
[09:19.640 --> 09:21.080]  Wednesday night
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.560]  That's on twitter real alex jones where I openly say it satire. I openly say
[09:26.120 --> 09:31.000]  You know bryan stelters god, whatever he says is reality. No one's censoring anybody. It's pure satire
[09:31.640 --> 09:34.200]  And I got up there and I went we've been reinstated to google
[09:34.200 --> 09:40.440]  And youtube and apple and and itunes and stitcher and and and and spotify
[09:41.080 --> 09:43.960]  Because chris cuomo and and bryan stelter
[09:44.680 --> 09:49.240]  And uh, all the rest of them said no one's censoring any conservatives
[09:49.560 --> 09:53.080]  No one's been banned after months and months and months calling for me to be banned
[09:53.320 --> 09:58.760]  And now everybody from and culture to gab mcganis being banned off platforms being delisted only negative stuff up top
[09:58.920 --> 10:00.920]  Their tweets their facebook posts going nowhere
[10:00.920 --> 10:04.920]  Prayer university banned
[10:06.360 --> 10:09.720]  But now they say trump is the void of any fact so I love how
[10:10.280 --> 10:12.600]  They thought trump was asleep. They thought congress was asleep
[10:12.760 --> 10:18.600]  They try this giant unamerican power grab when their own contracts say their monopolies and are public commons
[10:18.600 --> 10:21.240]  And they would not censor individual political speech
[10:23.400 --> 10:25.640]  That's their federal agreement
[10:25.640 --> 10:33.240]  The publishers that certify the speech so they've broken the social contract like we're a bunch of idiots
[10:34.920 --> 10:42.200]  And they're saying no this happens. So either sarcastic video going think against satire sarcasm. It's it's not fake. It's a joke
[10:43.240 --> 10:45.880]  Like saying pigs fly. I don't literally say they fly
[10:47.480 --> 10:49.880]  But they play on the illiteracy of the public. It's sick
[10:51.640 --> 10:53.640]  And I said
[10:53.640 --> 10:59.480]  Oh, Chris Cuomo says no conservatives are being banned. No libertarians. No one's being banned on facebook youtube
[10:59.560 --> 11:05.240]  They're all just promoting on CNN. So I said we had five billion views on our 15 channels on youtube. We had five
[11:05.960 --> 11:12.760]  Million followers. We had five billion followers on facebook. We had 16 million followers on itunes david night's big success
[11:12.760 --> 11:14.760]  Was that he had more than I did nine million
[11:15.960 --> 11:17.720]  They blew it all away
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.880]  There weren't even strikes on our accounts. They just did it
[11:19.880 --> 11:23.800]  So I said, oh well Chris Cuomo and Brian Stelter
[11:25.480 --> 11:27.480]  And all the rest of them
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.000]  Say that no one's being censored and it's totally insane. So I said the good news is I'm back on youtube
[11:33.480 --> 11:40.040]  And my 35,000 videos on one channel are back and I'm on facebook and all those people that liked me and went there and
[11:40.680 --> 11:44.760]  Contributed and commented and everything we did. They didn't blow it away. I hit my head
[11:45.640 --> 11:47.640]  A month ago. I was in the hospital
[11:47.640 --> 11:51.240]  This is an allegory. It didn't really happen. This is not fake news. It's called an allegory
[11:51.720 --> 11:53.800]  I hit my head like rip man winkle woke up
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.360]  And I thought they'd taken me off facebook and 26 other platforms, but then
[12:01.160 --> 12:03.880]  The cnn people like Cuomo and stelter
[12:05.320 --> 12:06.920]  and
[12:06.920 --> 12:08.920]  The rest of them told me that no
[12:09.800 --> 12:14.840]  No one's censored. So I'm like, okay. Well, I can go to info wars.com. I go to real auctions channel
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.800]  I can go to all these places, but it's still it still says I'm down. But see that tells me I'm in a coma
[12:20.920 --> 12:27.960]  I'm actually in a hospital in a coma and because Cuomo said I'm still on no one's been censored. So I'm in a coma
[12:28.760 --> 12:32.280]  info wars is on youtube info wars is on facebook info wars is on apple
[12:32.440 --> 12:34.440]  It's on all its other platforms spotify
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  It's on itunes and I
[12:38.600 --> 12:44.360]  I am this isn't even real. I'm not in a podcast studio. I'm not talking to folks on our own audience at info wars.com
[12:44.360 --> 12:45.800]  I
[12:45.800 --> 12:47.800]  imagined that
[12:48.040 --> 12:52.440]  And google showed trump's state of the union and it's not gaming 96% of the results
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.040]  But we all know the truth it is and what type of arrogant evil people
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.240]  Promote us all being banned and then do it
[13:02.200 --> 13:04.600]  And 96% of conservative news blocked
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.680]  And then they sit there and tell us it isn't happening what type of people
[13:10.680 --> 13:15.240]  Do stuff like that well people to think you're idiots
[13:16.520 --> 13:23.160]  Now in closing before we get back to the main broadcast with Owen shroyer and a bunch of special guests coming up today at info wars.com

[18:07.960 --> 18:14.280]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[18:14.760 --> 18:17.000]  eye comfort and respiratory function
[18:17.640 --> 18:22.840]  In the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:23.080 --> 18:26.520]  experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[18:26.840 --> 18:30.600]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[18:30.600 --> 18:37.480]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:37.880 --> 18:41.880]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine
[18:42.280 --> 18:47.160]  In fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase
[18:47.240 --> 18:51.720]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body

[20:36.920 --> 20:44.120]  All right, I've got a ton of news to get to today
[20:45.160 --> 20:48.120]  Caitlyn Bennett is going to be joining me at 11 30
[20:49.960 --> 20:56.440]  And she has well two things that have happened recently that I wanted to get her on to cover and it's just amazing
[21:01.880 --> 21:03.880]  All you got to do is go out in the real world
[21:03.880 --> 21:09.560]  And you'll be amazed at the type of change you can impact
[21:11.960 --> 21:13.960]  And so we've got that going on
[21:17.320 --> 21:19.800]  Meanwhile though president trump is
[21:20.680 --> 21:22.680]  hammering the tech giants
[21:23.480 --> 21:25.000]  right now
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.120]  Trump on establishment media. This is from dan lineman at news wars.com
[21:30.120 --> 21:34.120]  Truth doesn't matter to them
[21:34.440 --> 21:38.680]  And then he comes out he says they only have hatred and their agenda
[21:39.560 --> 21:42.680]  He says they are the enemy of the people doubling down on that
[21:43.320 --> 21:45.000]  but you'll see
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.280]  They try to spin this and what do they say trump has declared war on the media
[21:51.160 --> 21:54.280]  No, the media declared war on trump
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  Long long ago
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.160]  See what they do. They always like to flip reality
[22:02.600 --> 22:05.800]  Hillary Clinton colludes with the russians trump colluded with the russians
[22:06.440 --> 22:08.440]  Hillary Clinton laundering money
[22:08.760 --> 22:13.640]  Clinton's guilty of campaign finance violations trump is committing campaign finance violation
[22:15.720 --> 22:21.880]  Antifa the trump haters the trump protesters the most vile disgusting hateful violent
[22:21.880 --> 22:27.720]  Discriminatory people out there. What do they say trump supporters are violent and hatred and intolerant
[22:30.040 --> 22:32.040]  And this is our reality now
[22:34.920 --> 22:37.800]  But you have to understand what's really behind all this
[22:39.240 --> 22:41.240]  You've got the chinese angle
[22:41.320 --> 22:45.160]  Where china is is running apple now and about to be running google
[22:46.200 --> 22:49.720]  And they want to bring their real-time facial recognition
[22:49.720 --> 22:57.880]  Security grid to america. They want to bring their social credit score via social media to america
[22:59.640 --> 23:03.880]  But then you have another angle to this and that's the obama angle
[23:04.680 --> 23:06.680]  You see barack obama
[23:06.760 --> 23:08.760]  is guilty
[23:09.400 --> 23:11.400]  of many crimes
[23:12.760 --> 23:14.760]  And a lot of people in government know that
[23:15.560 --> 23:17.560]  Including the president of the united states
[23:17.560 --> 23:20.920]  And that's why obama has been in hiding
[23:21.480 --> 23:26.840]  Or even hanging out in south africa where in fact as far as i know he made his first public appearance in america
[23:27.800 --> 23:29.800]  yesterday in
[23:29.960 --> 23:35.720]  Months i can't even recall the last time he had a public appearance in america. He went to a school in chicago yesterday
[23:36.200 --> 23:39.320]  First time i've seen him in public in america in a long long time
[23:41.480 --> 23:43.480]  But so obama
[23:43.480 --> 23:49.320]  First had to begin the spying on the trump campaign
[23:51.640 --> 23:53.640]  Because he was afraid
[23:53.720 --> 23:58.920]  Of what trump knew about hillary clinton's private email server. Well, why would obama be concerned about that?
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.960]  Well, he was the president when she was secretary of state
[24:02.440 --> 24:08.600]  Which now we're learning which we already knew that china was basically in hillary clinton's computer
[24:09.240 --> 24:12.200]  In fact, it was china's computer. It wasn't hillary clinton's private server
[24:12.200 --> 24:14.440]  It was china's private server hillary clinton
[24:16.280 --> 24:18.520]  Created an illegal server for china
[24:20.920 --> 24:24.280]  What else do you find out diane feinstein chinese spy 20 years
[24:25.400 --> 24:26.840]  hillary clinton
[24:26.840 --> 24:28.200]  chinese spy
[24:28.200 --> 24:30.360]  In the secretary of state office
[24:31.560 --> 24:37.320]  china gets the list of all cia assets in china murders dozens of them
[24:37.320 --> 24:44.760]  Now what did obama say i didn't know about that secret server oops
[24:45.480 --> 24:48.520]  Yes, he did. He was emailing it under a pseudonym
[24:49.240 --> 24:51.240]  Oh nothing to see there
[24:52.360 --> 24:54.360]  So now he knows he lied
[24:54.600 --> 25:00.120]  He knows he's directly involved in the chinese hacking. He's directly involved in the illegal server
[25:00.760 --> 25:02.760]  So he has to spy on trump
[25:02.760 --> 25:11.320]  In order to figure out exactly how much trouble he could possibly be in how desperate he has to be to stop trump from getting in
[25:12.200 --> 25:15.240]  So who knows what they find found out spying on trump illegally
[25:17.080 --> 25:24.920]  Uh-oh, but now obama's involved in the illegal spy gate now obama's involved in the fake russian dossier that hillary clinton paid for
[25:25.720 --> 25:28.920]  Oh boy now obama's in deeper trouble
[25:29.800 --> 25:31.800]  So what does obama do?
[25:31.800 --> 25:36.120]  Well, he's a desperate criminal and he has to leverage every possible
[25:37.880 --> 25:41.560]  Outlet he can to try to save his own skin. So what does he do?
[25:42.440 --> 25:48.040]  Well, let's recall during obama's eight years in office. He was buddy buddy with the entire tech left
[25:48.200 --> 25:53.720]  He was buddy buddy with silicon valley. In fact silicon valley basically had an office in the west wing
[25:54.280 --> 25:59.800]  There's the viral picture right there eric schmitt mark zuckerberg other tech giants meeting with obama
[25:59.800 --> 26:01.800]  He's giving them the cheers
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.040]  Do we have the picture with their names on it guys? I'm just curious if we were able to find that
[26:07.800 --> 26:09.800]  And so
[26:10.120 --> 26:12.120]  He's buddy buddy with them
[26:12.840 --> 26:14.840]  He's in a desperate situation
[26:15.160 --> 26:17.160]  Yeah, there it is right there
[26:17.560 --> 26:19.560]  Cisco google
[26:19.640 --> 26:21.640]  oracle netflix
[26:21.720 --> 26:23.720]  stanford yahoo twitter
[26:24.040 --> 26:26.040]  zuckerberg there steve jobs there
[26:26.040 --> 26:28.040]  So
[26:28.760 --> 26:35.640]  There you go all of them there all represented dining with obama had an office in the west wing
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.960]  So obama now and these goons they who knows what they know or don't know
[26:43.080 --> 26:47.000]  But now obama is in big trouble now see
[26:48.440 --> 26:50.440]  See obama's in big trouble now
[26:50.520 --> 26:55.160]  Now it's public information. He knew about the illegal server. He lied about it
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.160]  He started the
[26:57.640 --> 27:03.720]  Fake russia investigation. That's james clapper that admitted that on msnbc. He said no obama started this
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.760]  So he started the illegal spying it all started with obama. So now he's in big trouble
[27:09.240 --> 27:11.240]  And who broke that story?
[27:12.280 --> 27:14.280]  Infowars.com
[27:14.600 --> 27:16.600]  So what does obama do?
[27:16.760 --> 27:20.680]  He calls up his buddy, but buddies at google. He calls up his buddies at twitter
[27:20.680 --> 27:28.040]  He calls up his buddies at apple at least the ones that are still alive calls up his buddies on youtube. He calls up all his buddies
[27:29.080 --> 27:30.440]  and he says
[27:30.440 --> 27:32.440]  guys we got to do something about
[27:33.480 --> 27:35.480]  this jones guy
[27:35.880 --> 27:37.880]  We got to do something about this
[27:38.040 --> 27:40.040]  fake news
[27:40.920 --> 27:45.080]  And google and youtube and twitter and facebook. Yes obama. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes
[27:45.080 --> 27:51.480]  You see he's the cult leader. He's the god to the left. So they
[27:52.680 --> 28:00.040]  Are at his beckon call. Yes, obama. Sensor alex. Yes. You got it sensor conservatives. Okay. Yes rig our algorithms. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[28:02.360 --> 28:04.360]  And guess what you're gonna find out

[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  Just like the illegal server
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.160]  Just like fast and furious
[28:11.880 --> 28:13.720]  Just like all of it
[28:13.720 --> 28:16.200]  It was barack hussein obama
[28:16.920 --> 28:18.920]  with his fingerprints
[28:18.760 --> 28:20.760]  All over it
[28:23.320 --> 28:29.240]  And so what are they doing trying to censor trump trying to censor infowars trying to censor anybody that's willing to report
[28:29.800 --> 28:31.160]  the truth
[28:31.160 --> 28:33.480]  About the high crimes committed by barack obama
[28:35.800 --> 28:37.800]  So now you know
[28:38.520 --> 28:41.400]  Apple and google have sold out to china
[28:41.400 --> 28:49.160]  And barack obama is now the fault the the fault is a combination of two words the thought and cult leader
[28:49.720 --> 28:52.120]  Of the tech left the thought and cult leader

[34:15.720 --> 34:25.000]  She went on Kent State's campus the other day undercover to ask people about herself
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.480]  What's up guys I'm Caitlyn Bennett the Kent State gun girl and today I'm going undercover at Kent State to see what students think about
[34:31.480 --> 34:33.480]  Caitlyn Bennett the Kent State gun girl
[34:35.880 --> 34:39.080]  Did you guys see the girl who graduated with a rifle on her back?
[34:40.040 --> 34:44.280]  Yep, she was in my hall. I walked right past her. Yeah, you walked right past her
[34:44.280 --> 34:49.960]  I thought it was a little over the top and ridiculous and it got that much attention
[34:50.840 --> 34:55.880]  I will say something but she might class me. I don't I don't want to I don't want to threaten. No say your opinion
[34:55.960 --> 35:02.040]  I'm good. Uh, she could do it. She won't yes. Actually. I saw her in east way the other day. Oh, you saw her in east way
[35:02.200 --> 35:08.840]  No way. Oh my gosh. It's crazy to think that she had a rifle in her bag on campus. She had it in her bag
[35:08.840 --> 35:16.280]  Um, I'm pretty sure I am an avid supporter of the second amendment, but I don't believe that an ar-15 belongs here on Kent campus
[35:16.680 --> 35:22.200]  I just think what she did was disrespectful, especially knowing the campus's history with like firearms
[35:22.520 --> 35:27.560]  This girl literally walked on campus right over there with a rifle on her back in her graduation photos
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.520]  What do you guys think about that? I mean, I feel like what she is is just like
[35:33.800 --> 35:35.000]  I don't think
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.120]  I mean what you think she's she's pretty be honest. So if you guys were next to her right now
[35:40.200 --> 35:45.880]  Like what would you say to her knowing that she did all that? I actually rehearsed this last night in the shower
[35:46.520 --> 35:51.480]  If you were next to her right now, what advice would you give her get more schooling go back for your masters?
[35:52.680 --> 35:54.680]  Get a job. I don't know if she has a job
[35:55.080 --> 35:59.000]  But I know she's coming back here for an open carry rally. You can't get a job with pink hair
[35:59.640 --> 36:04.280]  She's coming back here for an open carry rally. What would you say to her if you saw her here right now?
[36:04.280 --> 36:06.280]  I'd say go f*** yourself
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.040]  I would just say goodbye. So what if I told you I am that girl?
[36:11.160 --> 36:13.160]  No, I am that girl
[36:14.120 --> 36:15.960]  It can't be
[36:15.960 --> 36:16.760]  Really?
[36:16.760 --> 36:18.760]  What if I told you that I am that girl?
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.640]  Wow, okay. I'd be very surprised. What if I told you guys that I'm that girl
[36:25.480 --> 36:27.000]  You still think I'm
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.280]  I mean, I just don't think what she's doing is really appropriate for this campus. So if you guys were in front of her right now, what would you say?
[36:34.280 --> 36:36.280]  I would say
[36:43.880 --> 36:48.920]  Great stuff there. So katelyn Bennett joins me out. What what made you think of that idea?
[36:48.920 --> 36:54.440]  It's brilliant. It's original and you barely even had to try you just put glasses in a hat on and everybody fell for it still
[36:54.440 --> 36:56.440]  So what made you think of that?
[36:58.200 --> 36:59.560]  So I
[36:59.560 --> 37:04.200]  Love making videos like this. I've actually been making them for the past year on kent state campus
[37:04.520 --> 37:11.000]  But I knew since everyone knew who I was I would never be able to go back with the microphone and get people to talk with me
[37:11.320 --> 37:14.440]  So I was like, what if I just go up to people
[37:15.080 --> 37:20.520]  Undercover and just let them talk crap about me and then see if they'd say it to my face
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.480]  Because they do a lot of talk online, but rarely do they have anything to say to my face
[37:25.960 --> 37:31.400]  And all I did was put on some glasses and a hat and pulled up my hair and it worked
[37:31.880 --> 37:33.880]  Only one person knew who I was
[37:34.440 --> 37:35.880]  See, I'm shocked by that
[37:35.880 --> 37:40.680]  I mean like I said all you did was put your hair in a hat and glasses on you didn't even do big makeup
[37:40.840 --> 37:47.080]  Or any change your hair color or anything just took but doesn't that really show that they really knew nothing about you?
[37:47.080 --> 37:51.320]  I mean, they didn't even know what you looked like. They just heard rumors and made you know assumptions
[37:53.800 --> 37:59.080]  Yeah, so what really was funny was the girl who said that I had a rifle in my bag
[37:59.800 --> 38:03.080]  And I walked around campus with it and I'm like, oh my gosh
[38:03.080 --> 38:06.680]  She had a rifle in her bag and she's like I'm pretty sure
[38:07.160 --> 38:11.880]  These people don't know anything about what I did what I stand for it. They just know that they hate me
[38:12.200 --> 38:14.520]  Yeah, but your rifle the rifle you had in your bag
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.760]  It had the chainsaw bayonet, right? You had the automatic chainsaw on there, correct?
[38:19.720 --> 38:22.040]  That's where the new no time semi automatic
[38:22.840 --> 38:28.600]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a fully automatic chainsaw bayonet with a fully semi automatic rifle
[38:28.680 --> 38:32.680]  Yeah, and you were you were about to get an assault straw attached to that as well
[38:33.080 --> 38:39.720]  But they made straws illegal so you you cancelled that but I wanted to say about this video before we get into another video
[38:39.720 --> 38:42.920]  That you just put out with some breaking news that you can talk about here today
[38:42.920 --> 38:47.800]  I wanted to ask you something because I think there's a big one of the biggest problems in our society
[38:47.960 --> 38:49.960]  This isn't necessarily a political issue
[38:50.440 --> 38:53.560]  But because of the communication moving into the digital realm
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.520]  You've got people that
[38:57.080 --> 39:02.440]  Do most of their communication digitally so they never actually have face-to-face interactions where they have to look at someone in the eye
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.080]  Or face the potential consequences of what they say about someone to their face
[39:07.080 --> 39:14.120]  And so I'm sorry the crew is flashing all these ridiculous possible attachments from USA today on the AR
[39:14.120 --> 39:20.520]  But anyway, I think that it's a big problem in our society that people just don't have the face-to-face interactions
[39:21.160 --> 39:27.480]  But did you experience when people actually met you as sharks with laser beams on their freaking heads Dr. Evil?
[39:27.640 --> 39:33.480]  When people actually met you and looked you in the eye after they insulted you after they said all these rude and mean things about you
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.240]  And made all these assumptions and you stood there and took it with a smile and said hey
[39:37.480 --> 39:42.760]  Did you see people's attitudes changed? Did you feel like they were maybe more open-minded once they realized?
[39:42.760 --> 39:45.400]  Okay, this is actually her. I'm I'm looking at her
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.520]  Yeah, so they 100% changed the girl in the green shirt that said that
[39:53.720 --> 39:59.400]  I was you guys bleeped it out. So I don't know if I can say it, but she said that I was shitty
[39:59.400 --> 40:06.360]  I was shitty. She her her complete the meter changed. You mean you could see she stumbled on her word
[40:06.520 --> 40:11.960]  She wouldn't say it to my face after I revealed who I was and we actually ended up having a conversation
[40:12.680 --> 40:15.480]  about why I took that photo and you know
[40:15.960 --> 40:22.360]  She left thinking a little bit differently about me then when she came up, which is always great to do
[40:22.840 --> 40:28.600]  But I ended up picking the glasses in the hat off just to sit there and kind of talk to students coming by
[40:28.600 --> 40:34.200]  I got a lot of people cussing at me and giving me the finger and every time they would do that
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.520]  I would say come talk to me. I wouldn't shout back. I would say come talk to me
[40:38.600 --> 40:40.600]  Let me explain why I did this
[40:40.600 --> 40:46.360]  Very few of them did so that's just how they are on college campuses. Yeah, no, that's exactly that's typical
[40:46.840 --> 40:50.520]  So I think this is a good lesson in life to me
[40:50.600 --> 40:53.400]  I thought that that was the most powerful lesson from this video
[40:53.400 --> 40:59.240]  And it just affirmed what I was thinking is that people have it's a dehumanization thing, right?
[40:59.560 --> 41:04.040]  Caitlyn Bennett the kent state gun girl. She's dehumanized. She's just some radical gun
[41:04.280 --> 41:08.200]  She carries a rifle on her with a corgi and a shark with a laser on her head attached
[41:08.200 --> 41:13.160]  I mean, she's the worst and then you meet someone and you talk to them. It's like, okay, wait a second
[41:13.160 --> 41:16.840]  You know, maybe I don't like this person's ideas. Maybe I don't like this person's politics
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.960]  But this is actually a person just like me. We have things in common and we could actually enjoy each other's company
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.640]  Maybe we hate each other's politics, but that doesn't mean we have to hate each other
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.200]  And I think that there's this this thing happening right now in the digital world where people are becoming
[41:30.660 --> 41:37.240]  Unhumanized and so it's easier to hate somebody that you never actually see or confront in in the real world
[41:37.640 --> 41:40.600]  And I think that your video kind of illustrates this
[41:41.160 --> 41:43.640]  So do you think people need to look at this and say hey, look don't
[41:44.120 --> 41:48.440]  Hate a trump supporter as a person if you hate their ideas. I'm fine. If you want to come up to me and tell me
[41:48.440 --> 41:54.360]  I'm crazy. I'm down like let's I'm perfectly okay with that but don't think that I'm the worst person on earth and that
[41:54.360 --> 41:58.680]  I need to die or I'm some Nazi. I mean, that's the dehumanizing effect that I think
[41:59.320 --> 42:01.480]  The digital social media world has had on people
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.960]  Yeah, so we see it on college campuses all the time where
[42:06.520 --> 42:12.280]  A group gets so radicalized in their beliefs that they are unwilling to have a conversation with the other side
[42:12.280 --> 42:18.360]  And if we just talk to each other, we would come to find that we both care about the same things
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.680]  We just have different ways of getting there of fixing these issues
[42:22.840 --> 42:27.240]  And if we could just sit down and have a conversation about what each other believes
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.840]  I think that we would find more common ground than what they originally thought
[42:33.320 --> 42:34.920]  but you know
[42:34.920 --> 42:40.280]  I guess I'm kind of guilty of that too because when I get thousands of death threats and people who always
[42:40.280 --> 42:45.640]  You know coming after me on twitter on social media. I start to feel the same way. It's like oh sure sure
[42:45.800 --> 42:48.840]  It definitely goes both ways. It definitely goes both ways
[42:48.840 --> 42:51.240]  But again, I mean I look at these antifa people that I confront
[42:51.240 --> 42:55.400]  I'm like look man outside of politics. We may be able to get along who knows we might even go to the same bar tonight
[42:55.640 --> 42:57.640]  You know, I don't know you got a mask on
[42:59.240 --> 43:05.560]  We knew it was coming the whole thing was for me like first demonize info wars lie about us build a straw man
[43:05.560 --> 43:11.000]  Then sue us to add credibility to that then have a few fake strikes on youtube and facebook
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.000]  With nebulous terms like bullying children and islamophobia
[43:15.240 --> 43:21.720]  And then wallah two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms

[47:03.320 --> 47:05.960]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[47:05.960 --> 47:20.840]  We now take you live to the central texas commenced ever and the heart of the resistance and now your host
[47:23.480 --> 47:28.840]  And i'm joined by katlyn vinnett you can find her on twitter at least for now at kate marie
[47:28.840 --> 47:36.920]  OX and that's where you can find a lot of her videos and other other content that she is putting out
[47:37.880 --> 47:41.800]  and she was planning and actually it was on the books there was a
[47:42.680 --> 47:48.440]  Open carry gun rights on campus march that you were planning katlyn on kent state
[47:49.240 --> 47:54.040]  But recently those plans have changed so let our audience know first of all what your plans were
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.040]  And what the breaking news is?
[47:58.840 --> 48:04.200]  Yeah, so my plans were to have um and a gathering of open carry
[48:05.160 --> 48:11.080]  Uh people open carrying their firearms on kent state campus. I actually did this exact same event in april
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.240]  And uh, I met with the police and met with the dean of students
[48:15.320 --> 48:22.840]  I met with a couple of other people in the administration and it went fine and just to be clear every time you've done something like this on campus
[48:22.840 --> 48:30.760]  Including your uh senior photo. You've always contacted police and campus. So you're all you've always checked out all the boxes
[48:31.880 --> 48:39.800]  Always I have always done um everything from my standpoint of being responsible and respectful and giving them the courtesy to know
[48:40.360 --> 48:44.280]  Um last april they encouraged me not to go through a student organization
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.440]  Not to be sponsored by a student organization to uh, just do it as people who are coming to campus
[48:50.440 --> 48:56.440]  And so they they literally encouraged me not to go through the school not to go through student organization
[48:56.440 --> 49:02.120]  So that's what I did. So I'm doing the exact same thing this time right now
[49:02.120 --> 49:07.640]  I'm doing the exact same thing and because black lives matter said that they were going
[49:08.120 --> 49:10.120]  Excuse me. They were going to protest
[49:10.520 --> 49:16.840]  They decided um, they would send me a cease and desist and try to state policies that I'm breaking
[49:16.840 --> 49:25.080]  When in fact, I'm not breaking any policy because it is the law that I can come open carry on that campus and they know
[49:25.880 --> 49:30.120]  They know exactly what they're doing because I worked with them in april to do this
[49:30.520 --> 49:34.040]  So I actually tried to have a meeting with
[49:34.760 --> 49:38.520]  Uh, these administrators and the secretary refused to work with me
[49:40.280 --> 49:45.640]  So wait a second here, uh, are they saying that because black lives matter complained about your march?
[49:45.640 --> 49:49.240]  They had to shut it down. Is that what you're saying? I they were
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.040]  From my standpoint, I went and I actually brought up to the police
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.880]  And I brought it up to the dean of students that black lives matter from cleveland
[50:00.200 --> 50:06.360]  Wanted to come and protest and the name of their counter protest is literally fight the right
[50:06.760 --> 50:12.040]  If that's not something that shows that they want to be confrontational and violent
[50:12.040 --> 50:17.080]  I don't know what else is and I what I talked on the phone to the dean of students on monday morning
[50:17.480 --> 50:21.640]  And I said I want to have a meeting with you because I want to stay away from these people
[50:22.200 --> 50:25.400]  Do I need to you know change location? What can we do?
[50:25.960 --> 50:30.440]  Um, I want to have a meeting with you and the police and he said that's fine. We can have a meeting
[50:30.920 --> 50:32.920]  Well that same day I go to the school
[50:33.400 --> 50:38.920]  And I they refuse to let me schedule a meeting with him because they're biased against my beliefs
[50:38.920 --> 50:45.800]  Um, but I'm still going and hundreds of gun owners are still going in some shape or form
[50:46.040 --> 50:53.960]  They aren't going to silence me and I'm in talk with different people about uh, the legality of this and their policies
[50:54.280 --> 50:55.560]  So we'll see how it plays out
[50:55.560 --> 50:59.080]  But I'll be there september 29th and so will hundreds of gun owners
[50:59.160 --> 51:03.080]  Yeah, and I believe our own millie weaver our reporter was planning on being there too, correct
[51:03.080 --> 51:08.680]  Yeah, so so so millie weaver will also be there now. This is this is ironic to me because
[51:09.320 --> 51:11.960]  I'm a college graduate. I know how this I know how this deal goes
[51:12.680 --> 51:18.040]  I bet you kent state has no problem asking you for donations sending you emails asking you for donations
[51:18.120 --> 51:23.880]  So so you're right to donate your money to the university after you paid already to go there
[51:24.280 --> 51:30.120]  That's so you know, hey, you know, come on, you know shuffle, so give me some cash. Come on. Okay. Maybe I'll give you some cash
[51:30.120 --> 51:37.720]  Hey, can I open can I can I express my my right to carry a a gun on campus? Well, whoa, come on. Let's not get out of control here
[51:40.040 --> 51:46.920]  Yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous. I mean I still I called the guy or I guess the lawyer attorney whatever he calls himself
[51:47.400 --> 51:54.040]  Yeah, he presented himself as the legal representative to kent state in the cease and desist letter and um
[51:54.040 --> 51:59.480]  I actually called him and I was like what can I do to be within policy?
[51:59.880 --> 52:04.440]  And he said that's not my job to tell you and I said what kind of legal representative are you?
[52:04.840 --> 52:09.080]  That you can't even tell me what I need to do to be within your policy
[52:09.480 --> 52:12.680]  And he's like and I said I'm still going to show up
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.920]  But I want to show up within policy
[52:14.920 --> 52:20.760]  So if you could help me that would be great because my intentions were to never go against policy
[52:20.760 --> 52:26.680]  I that's not my intention. I'm not here to cause trouble, but they have been unwilling to work with me and uh
[52:26.920 --> 52:30.440]  It's been from the legal standpoint and now from the administrators
[52:30.600 --> 52:35.960]  So it sounds to me like the the real policy here that they're not going to admit to you is we don't want your march here
[52:36.120 --> 52:39.560]  Leave us alone, but if you can afford to donate some money, please do
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.120]  And they want me to go through a student organization this time and it would cost me thousands of dollars
[52:46.120 --> 52:51.560]  I want to estimate at least four thousand dollars to have campus security there, which I don't need
[52:51.720 --> 52:57.560]  We're gun owners. We don't need security from the police. Uh, that's exactly why we and why would you need security?
[52:57.720 --> 53:00.840]  What is that? Why would you need security? Is somebody threatening you?
[53:03.320 --> 53:06.920]  They uh, they actually tried to make me pay security fees in april
[53:07.160 --> 53:14.280]  But I said no we're just coming as members of the public me and my friends are gonna walk through campus here and talk to students
[53:14.280 --> 53:19.880]  And I said I'm not I'm not paying these security fees and I weaseled myself out of them actually
[53:20.360 --> 53:22.680]  Uh, which is exactly what I'm doing this time
[53:22.840 --> 53:28.200]  But I think they know that I'm allowed to be there and do exactly what I want to do
[53:28.520 --> 53:33.320]  But they want to scare me because they don't want the protesters to show up and they don't want to have to deal
[53:33.720 --> 53:37.080]  With all of the fighting that the other side is going to do
[53:37.560 --> 53:41.880]  We I already told them I plan on walking away from them and we would move our march to somewhere else
[53:41.880 --> 53:44.280]  Well, and again, it just illustrates how
[53:45.240 --> 53:47.960]  If you're a conservative and you want to have any sort of event
[53:48.360 --> 53:53.720]  You're going to be threatened with violence or other such activities to try to disrupt it now
[53:53.960 --> 53:59.400]  I'm not claiming that to an element. We don't do the same thing to their events. However, we don't have
[54:00.280 --> 54:06.680]  A rap sheet of 600 times where we've committed acts of violence against the other political side. That's always the left
[54:07.080 --> 54:09.960]  That's why you can't have an event without security there
[54:09.960 --> 54:12.760]  Because they know someone's going to show up and get violent
[54:12.840 --> 54:16.840]  They know if you have an event they have to have security to protect their own property
[54:17.080 --> 54:20.360]  But they try to flip it and act like it's you that's going to cause the danger
[54:20.440 --> 54:23.560]  So it's totally totally unfair. But here's what I would say
[54:24.360 --> 54:29.320]  As we're closing this segment and this is a tactic that I think we need to use more
[54:29.960 --> 54:35.720]  We need to use the left's rhetoric and we need to use the left's virtue signaling against them
[54:35.800 --> 54:38.760]  So basically if I were you what I would say is I would change my
[54:38.760 --> 54:42.040]  My standpoint here and I would say look
[54:43.800 --> 54:50.920]  I'm trying to bring back gun rides for females on campus because there is a rape culture on my campus
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.280]  There is a culture of rape women are getting raped when they walk around if they get looked at wrong
[54:56.360 --> 54:57.000]  They're raped
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.760]  So use the whole campus rape culture that the left tries to paint in america even though a college campus
[55:03.240 --> 55:05.320]  I mean, I we don't need to get into the numbers
[55:05.320 --> 55:09.560]  It's just a total lie that it's some rape culture on college campus. Give me a break
[55:10.040 --> 55:15.080]  Okay, but that's what you do you take their side of the things which is college campus is a rape culture
[55:15.320 --> 55:17.320]  Every woman that walks around could get raped
[55:17.480 --> 55:20.760]  I can't walk around, you know solo on a college campus because it's a rape culture
[55:20.920 --> 55:25.480]  So you use that argument against them. That's what I would do moving forward and then what are they going to do?
[55:25.640 --> 55:29.160]  Say, uh, are they going to admit there's not a rape culture?
[55:29.160 --> 55:35.160]  Or are they going to be forced to say they don't care if you get raped because that's the only way out for them?
[55:36.360 --> 55:42.760]  Right, I've actually talked to a lot of feminists on campus saying like we should be able to own a gun because actually kent state's
[55:43.240 --> 55:44.120]  rape
[55:44.120 --> 55:48.840]  Reportings have tripled in the past year, which is very frightening and actually a woman
[55:49.560 --> 55:54.280]  Week before school started almost got abducted on campus and because of kent state's policies
[55:54.280 --> 56:01.000]  Uh, she would have been deterred from carrying a firearm, especially if she was a student and uh, they the feminists tell me that
[56:01.080 --> 56:02.200]  We don't need guns
[56:02.200 --> 56:05.880]  We need to use our words and talk to these rapists so that they don't
[56:06.040 --> 56:08.520]  Yeah, and maybe what about a trendy bracelet?
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.320]  Maybe we can get a trendy bracelet like in sweden that says don't rape me bro
[56:17.160 --> 56:19.160]  And there is I mean here's the thing
[56:19.160 --> 56:23.800]  The college campus rape culture to me is a myth. That's not to say it doesn't happen
[56:23.960 --> 56:26.920]  And that's not to say that there aren't situations there are in fact
[56:27.160 --> 56:29.160]  I remember there was a situation where
[56:29.400 --> 56:31.640]  My sister was at a major university in missouri
[56:32.200 --> 56:37.400]  And there was a situation where there was a stalker or a creeper walking around
[56:37.800 --> 56:38.600]  um
[56:38.600 --> 56:45.080]  A certain area of campus where the where most students live and was going into houses and just and just perving on girls
[56:45.080 --> 56:48.840]  Well, you're gonna tell me that one of those perverts gets shot in the leg
[56:49.480 --> 56:53.560]  There's gonna be another one the next day. No, there's not gonna be anymore. That's the point
[56:53.960 --> 56:56.280]  So you need I think we need to use their rhetoric against it
[56:56.280 --> 57:02.040]  If you're gonna tell me that college campus is a rape culture, then I should be allowed to have a gun final words from katelyn vinnett
[57:04.040 --> 57:07.240]  Yes, I absolutely believe that but in general even if they
[57:08.200 --> 57:13.240]  We know the fact that they aren't rape culture centers or whatever because that statistic is uh
[57:13.240 --> 57:15.400]  Done by bad studies and bad science
[57:15.800 --> 57:21.640]  Uh, but even if they weren't even if they believe that they weren't uh, you know a place for rape culture
[57:21.720 --> 57:27.400]  It is still all right to have a gun and conceal it on a college campus on a public university
[57:27.480 --> 57:33.080]  It's all right, and that's the bottom. It's the bottom line is that campus carry should be passed for all universities
[57:33.480 --> 57:40.600]  And why is it that 90 percent of shootings? I don't know the exact number, but it's it's close to 90 percent of shootings happens in a gun-free zone
[57:40.600 --> 57:47.560]  Hmm, maybe we should change something about that katelyn marie katelyn vinnett. Thank you so much for joining us libertyhangout.org is her website

[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.640]  Owen shroyer
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.960]  We've got breaking news here ladies and gentlemen
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.760]  as you know
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.760]  If you've been following me for a while now i've come from the sports media
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.680]  and
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.680]  i'm a i'm a trans media ight i'm a trans
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.800]  broadcaster trans broadcasting and i've i've completed my transition now
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.840]  From sports media to political media, but i still like to every once in a while dabble in sports
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.720]  And i've got some breaking news here folks now as you know
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.280]  the nfl
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.840]  Well, they're they're struggling with the ratings to which i think there are multiple reasons
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.360]  But the big one is the anti americanism that's being displayed
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.160]  in the anthem protests
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.200]  And this is hurting the nfl the nfl tried to do something about it and they said you have to stand for the anthem
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.840]  Oops, and then the player said we're gonna kneel anyway, so the nfl said
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.120]  Okay, fine. You don't have to stand for the anthem
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.160]  Then some team said we'll stand for the anthem anthem some players said we won't stand for the anthem
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.400]  Then the tv network said we won't air the anthem, of course the irony is
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.920]  They never aired the anthem. Do you know that the nfl?
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.640]  Anthems were never even aired until cappernick took a knee
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:36.520]  So they only aired the anthem to show the players taking a knee now
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.840]  They're saying we'll never air the anthem because the players are taking a knee total
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.840]  180 irony
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.840]  But now the nfl has decided they've figured it out
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.600]  They have figured out how to deal with the anthem protests
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.440]  So instead of kneeling during the anthem, they're going to have a small moment of silence
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:02.360]  For well, I'll tell you what we've got the exclusive right here. We've got the exclusive brand new
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:03.880]  nfl
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:10.040]  PSA we've got it. We're airing it. We're breaking it right now. Let's go to this is breaking the brand new nfl
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040]  nfl PSA
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:18.600]  Ladies gentlemen transhumans transitioning humans by genders and gender queers
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:26.040]  The national football league and the home team are aware of social injustice and racial inequality in america
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.440]  We asked that you make today's environment welcoming and tolerant for all
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:37.240]  The nfl and its fans are very diverse. So we asked for a hate-free environment at today's game
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:44.280]  Now, please join us in a moment of silence for all the victims of social and racial injustice
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.840]  intolerance and discrimination
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.040]  Thank you
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:59.400]  Any intolerance and insensitivity will not be tolerated at today's game and you will be removed and banished from the facilities
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.960]  Now let's play some football
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:07.000]  All right, there you go. So that's what you get now when you go to the nfl games
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:14.040]  You're going to hear that nice new PSA and you're going to do a moment of silence for all of the victims of injustice in this country
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.280]  You better remove your hat
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.280]  You better not even think about kneeling
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840]  Or you're a racist bigot
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.280]  So just just realize that
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.520]  Now, of course, that is a fake PSA that we cut here at info wars, but is it really so?
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.520]  out there
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.160]  Would it really be so far-fetched for the nfl to make such a move
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.720]  might actually be a solution to this problem
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.160]  But
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.160]  With the nfl season just around the corner
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.840]  I've actually got some ideas
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.160]  I've got some ideas swirling in my head
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.360]  Ah, I've got some ideas
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.640]  In fact, you know what now is the perfect time because
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.480]  As I was discussing with uh, Voldemort jones today
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:11.160]  We may even be able to offer some cash prizes for such things that we're planning right now
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.360]  What do you think alex operation third dimensions coming, baby?
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.720]  And don't forget we really are selling out of body's ultimate turmeric formula
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:22.360]  But it's still 50 off until it sells out that a bunch is coming in a month incredible for information
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.720]  You name it bodies 50% off we need that hit that hard because folks really need to try it with 50% off brother
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.840]  And yes, I'm very excited about info wars. Can I say that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's all right info wars army, baby
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.040]  That's right. We're doing it. We're gonna do the the hard launch on

[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:19.580]  Well, what do they do when the darlings
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.180]  The it couple
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.820]  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, what are they going to do when they're no longer under the total control
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.420]  Of the cult left
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.420]  Well, they're going to replace the it couple Kim Kardashian and Kanye West who won't come out
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.700]  vehemently against trump so they have to be replaced as the it couple
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:47.980]  Kardashian's ratings are sliding Kanye West is going on radio saying support trump. We're going to have those clips here in this segment
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:52.140]  So they're going to have to replace the it couple because this it couple won't hate trump
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:07:00.460]  So Kim Kardashian and Kanye West will be phased out as the it couple and ariana grande and pete the dweeb davidson will be
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.780]  The new it couple the two
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:08.140]  It's like imagine you're in a light bulb aisle and you've got you know the highest wattage light bulbs on the top
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.500]  And then the dimmest, you know, you know, refrigerator light bulb, you know
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.700]  Little thing for like a flashlight those type of bulbs at your pete davidson ariana grande very low wattage
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.100]  So they're going to replace the it couple
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.980]  Kanye West and kim Kardashian because they just won't come out and hate trump
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.580]  You know, you see you got to come out and hate trump if you're going to be promoted by the establishment
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:26.220]  They refuse to do it
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:30.220]  But Kanye West is now going the opposite direction and supporting trump
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:35.900]  He goes on a popular radio station in chicago for what is a I believe the show is nationally syndicated, but
[01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.580]  It's on 107 5 w gci
[01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.820]  In chicago. This was yesterday. Kanye West defends
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:50.220]  President trump and his support for president trump on a popular chicago radio station. Here is that viral clip
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:55.900]  Because a lot of us as black people were very upset with the maga hat and the stance that you took on donald trump
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:00.860]  And we mentioned the off earlier off air earlier. You went on uh, jimmy foulin had the conversation
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.660]  Jimmy camo
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.700]  So what just don't don't confuse with the questions
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.340]  Do you want to talk about the maga hat in the stance?
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.660]  Here's what well first i want to say don't give me no compound thing make it simple for me, please
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.340]  Okay, here's the question
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:22.540]  How can you feel like you could support donald trump when he stands for so many things that are against black people in our struggle
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.780]  See pause it right there though before he answers
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:33.020]  That is a lie the very foundation and fabric of the question is based in lies untruth and propaganda
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.940]  And kanye west is about to break that down, but that's the incredible thing is
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:41.260]  I mean, it's just sad these people have been so brainwashed man. I'm not telling you. You have to love trump
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:45.500]  I'm not telling you have to like his policies, but to sit here and say trump's a racist anti-black
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:53.340]  And wrong not even close. All right now. Let's get kanye's response kanye trump is a racist. Why don't you hate him?
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.060]  you know
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:02.060]  We all know the fact that black people used to be republican, right? Yes, okay
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.060]  So do we though?
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.820]  Do we know it's a democrat party was a kkk
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.260]  Red blue it's like a gang
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500]  It's like bloods and crips
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:17.420]  Uh, think about c said bloods and crips. You've been in LA too long, you know
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.020]  It's like jesse ventures book
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:29.900]  Oh, yeah, we re blood the kins and the democrats. I got love for everybody that
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.340]  Was a statement of bravery
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.940]  And to not be
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.020]  In controlled and programmed
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.420]  That as a people
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.420]  We have to have a monolithic thought
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:48.860]  Because if we have a monolithic thought we are easily
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.860]  controlled
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.100]  And could also possibly be easily
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.260]  eliminated
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.740]  We have to think and voice
[01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.980]  our separate
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.260]  opinions
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.460]  because
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:07.020]  If we want to talk about the TMZ statement, they cut our tongues
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:12.940]  Now today we could say all we want about social media distance somebody
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:20.540]  Did you get push of this information this but I know black people that voted for trump that was scared to say
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.100]  That they did out loud
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.820]  That's some 1984 thought control
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:27.740]  mind control
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:29.740]  programming
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:37.980]  So because I've never voted in my life in all honesty and because my voice
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:45.260]  Is so strong. I never never even told people my opinion or my stance to after you won
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.180]  I didn't want to influence it, but I have the right
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.340]  As an american
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.340]  To have my own opinion
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.740]  You do have that right here. I have real quick
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:02.620]  Do you think wearing the hat because your wife did a wonderful thing and she got alice johnson out of jail
[01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:08.620]  But meeting that was trump that did that and so were you wearing the hat assisted in that whole situation happening?
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:10.860]  Yes
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.860]  And what I want to say is
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.180]  In my opinion
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.900]  Politicians are politicians is not
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.860]  One that's
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.540]  particularly
[01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:36.300]  Better than the other and I understand as black people since we want to speak in the separation because we actually won race
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:39.980]  The human race is actually one race race is a a man made
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:45.420]  Construct that was invented a couple hundred years ago. I'm sure geos you can give me the exact like history on that
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.060]  And accurate about the history of it
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:54.460]  But we actually are one race as human beings, but if we want to do the division of our culture and our color being
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:55.900]  uh
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:00.380]  Black I understand, you know that we had eight years where
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:05.340]  We love the idea of a black president and now it seems like
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:11.500]  We took a step backwards to where we only saw, you know, white presidents our entire life
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.620]  And it's like we would rather have a female president than to see
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:18.380]  uh another white man be president again
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.780]  And I I understand and I feel that
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:27.660]  But I just don't agree with it. I think some people have the problem that they feel like
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:34.860]  Your stance and your support of this particular person almost erases um some of the pro-black struggle
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:40.220]  Um things that we've associated with you through your music in the past like I mentioned earlier when you were talking about
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:46.700]  Uh the the lyric where you said your grandfather took your mother to the sit-ins and that's in your blood and that was representing the struggle
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.780]  So I think a lot of people feel like
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:55.180]  A lot of people feel like if you represent the struggle, how could you possibly represent this man?
[01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.420]  Let's take away the politics and the red and the blue with this particular man
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.060]  Let's say let's act like a
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.900]  America let's act like America was our girlfriend for a second
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.860]  Trump being office is like
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:15.020]  If you broke up with your girlfriend and she fell out with her girlfriend
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.140]  And you get on a phone with her
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:21.900]  And she lets you know everything that your girlfriend been doing the whole time
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.340]  Let's you see this
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:31.180]  Like you say the detention center that's something that was happening through a different a lot of different presidential eras
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:37.740]  And now we're seeing it and I'm a I'm a very transparent person. I like transparency. I like exposure
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:40.140]  I want to be exposed to the information
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:44.140]  So I can make my decision and I knew that this
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.540]  uh
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:54.220]  Rogue personality was going to allow me to see and understand and allow my brothers to understand
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:58.380]  What we were dealing with all the the the marches
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:06.220]  People fighting people standing up people having a conversation about politics our well-being. I knew that this was going to happen
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:09.340]  If he got into office
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:12.540]  It's like whether you like it or not. It could be a traumatic experience
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:13.260]  It could be whatever it is
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.340]  But sometimes you want to say like that's the whole funny thing is we talk about get out
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.740]  Woke and like that flash of light or something right?
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.700]  That's a flash of light to us as an entire community to see things that we wasn't seeing
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:31.900]  When obama was in office. It's like still happening. That was still happening. It's like we as a collective wasn't woke right?
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.220]  That's fair. Everybody is woke
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:39.660]  Okay, so so I want to go back to your statement where you said we're all one race to human race
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:43.020]  And I agree with that to an extent, but then why are some
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.820]  portions of a human race not treated
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.140]  Like other portions of the traditionally the darker color of any
[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:52.860]  uh
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:53.900]  Uh
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:15:01.820]  Culture has been you know treated in a lower way lower class now. This could go what you should do is have a follow-up
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.820]  with
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:10.700]  DLC tomorrow so he can give you the history and break down because I don't get my information from
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.340]  Books I get my information from the spirit
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:20.780]  I feel it. I go with my gut. I said let's uh, let's pause it right there. Let's pause it right there
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.900]  and
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.020]  You know, I'm not going to sit here and make any
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:33.820]  Commentary as far as the actual social circumstances that they're talking about here, but but let me let me just translate
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:39.340]  Psychologically what the host of the show just asked Kanye Kanye society has told me I'm a victim
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:43.980]  I want to be a victim. Don't tell me I'm not a victim. I am a victim

[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:53.420]  Towards victims. I'm a victim. Don't tell me I'm not a victim. That's the psychological response that they're now
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.780]  Putting out there. Why can't I be a victim?

[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:03.500]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:22.140]  You've found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.660]  All right, we're gonna finish this kanye west clip and then i'm gonna get to all the latest news
[01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:32.380]  And then mike adams and stewart roads from oath keepers join me in studio
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:38.780]  But i want to go back to well first of all kanye west made a great statement that i want to use now to motivate people
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.820]  Wearing a maga hat is a statement of bravery exactly
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:49.660]  So it's time for us to engage in more acts of bravery, but i wanted to go back because
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:58.060]  It's really illustrative of you want to talk about actual systematic racism against black people
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:02.940]  It's the propaganda telling them they're a victim and that's their identity
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:10.780]  That's their psychological enslavement. I'm a victim of society. There's nothing I can do about it. No, that's not true
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:19.660]  Everyone has been victimized by something the trick is to not let that define you not let that be your identity
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:22.140]  Not let that control your destiny
[01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:27.340]  And and even the people that that have that mindset it still doesn't dictate who they are
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.300]  I mean look at this successful radio host that has kanye west on
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:37.900]  So i mean it's just ridiculous, but it's a psychological operation against black people
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:40.620]  brought on by the rap industry
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.500]  brought in by the hollywood entertainment industry
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:47.260]  brought in by the democrat party formerly of the kkk
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.220]  brought on by barack obama
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:55.500]  You want to know how they're still keeping black people down in america? They're telling you you're a victim
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.500]  That is the biggest
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:04.860]  Way they're keeping black people down in america. It's all stemming directly from hollywood directly from the rap industry
[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:09.500]  But i digress let's go back to kanye west
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:15.420]  Who's actually addressing this and responds to that on this chicago radio show?
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:22.380]  The human race not treated like other portions. I didn't traditionally the darker color of any
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.380]  uh
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.220]  Uh
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:34.140]  Culture has been you know treated in a lower way a lower class now. This could go what you should do is I have a follow-up
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.140]  with
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:39.580]  dlc tomorrow so he can give you the history and break down
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:45.500]  Because I don't get my information from books. I get my information from the spirit
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:52.220]  I feel it. I go with my gut. I sit against all odds and say i'm gonna put this
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:54.700]  I'm gonna put this hat on
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.700]  And let's see what happened now
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.380]  You know the thing is
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.980]  In high school people was always trying to tell me what I could do what I couldn't do
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:08.380]  Can't wear the tight pants. Don't dress like the gap where these cross colors you think you just don't come to this, you know
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:15.260]  Be you know being his gang don't be in his gang like everyone always my whole life and trying to tell me
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:21.100]  What to do and I think by putting out new thoughts it's like and I'm not a historian
[01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:26.220]  Some are just I'm very loose with it. Say like there's a lot of philosophers and innovators that
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:32.540]  You know, there's some people that got on a boat and found America and some people that died, you know broken lonely
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.980]  It was still proven right after they passed away. So
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:39.900]  You know, I've got a pretty good track record
[01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.140]  of
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.140]  being right about stuff so
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.180]  Let's see because now we've got a direct line
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:50.860]  That's one of the things I got a direct line to adidas. I got a direct line to
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:58.060]  The president and let's see what happens with it and how I apply that to the city because I'm going to apply it
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.740]  You know, let me say we have to respect your decision
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:08.940]  Um, and you did explain why you support this man. The simple thing is I support everyone. That's the thing. I am in support
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.220]  I support
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.940]  Bernie Sanders. I love Bernie Sanders. I support
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:19.420]  Hillary, okay, I love him. I support Obama. I cry when he won and at the inauguration
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:24.700]  My mom was passed. I said mama. We did it. Don't you love how you like we support your decision
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:30.380]  We support your decision things that happen. It's like and you take the people black vocal Trump supporters
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:33.820]  two of the most black vocal Trump supporters are
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.340]  Mayweather and Kanye West
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.900]  And I think we got a lot of things
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.300]  in common
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.980]  self made
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:50.380]  And we don't move like we don't move act and think like african americans. We move and act and think like africans
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:53.260]  in america
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:54.700]  Because
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.060]  This is that program to be our country, but we can't make it ours
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:04.460]  Like Farrakhan said, it's like it's to be bought. I just bought 300 acres for for only seven million dollars
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:08.700]  300 acres. I'm looking. I'm finding a you know
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:16.220]  Another thousand acres right now to build our first school on campus. I am buying america
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.460]  and making it
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:22.460]  Mine the land of the free everybody's not in a position to make those purchases
[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:29.340]  Yeah, we know that everyone is not in a position, but they can be if I said that's the american dream
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:34.220]  Gave you you know some information about drake. We'd all be laughing about it. I think that's cold
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:40.780]  But if I say something to you about this is what I'm doing and you can see since people like to see people that
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:43.180]  Uh
[01:25:43.180 --> 01:25:45.180]  Oversee, but that's just it same culture
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:48.460]  Pause it right there. Kanye west buying up land
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:55.100]  Building a school. That's not mainstream news. Nobody cares. Kanye west. This is drake on an album. That's what they want
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.820]  That's what they want
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:00.780]  Go back
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:04.780]  At our culture that I love Michael Jordan, but I'm more inspired by Steve Jobs
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:09.820]  I connect more with Steve Jobs and I connect to Michael Jordan. Yeah, they do this like marketing
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:16.300]  You ever watch a basketball game and it just be like a marketing, you know, you're like, man, that's really aim towards
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:21.180]  It's like patching up using hip-hop marketing. It's almost patching us
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.260]  They think but it'd be a white company and in a higher people
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:32.060]  To speak directly to all we need this voice to sell this product of this old
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:34.620]  You know what I mean? It's like
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:39.100]  So the entire clip is obviously online. I think it's linked at info wars.com, but
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:45.900]  Here here is the thing it's not to sit here and act like Kanye west is some hero because he comes out and supports
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.900]  Trump it's
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:54.060]  It's the fact that Kanye west has as he says a big voice a large audience
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.780]  And is going against the grain
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.540]  And they don't know that people just can't even understand it
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.580]  I mean you hear the questions they're asking like Trump is racist black people are are demonized in this country
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:10.300]  How can you support? I mean, it's just all this victim mindset all of this propaganda mindset
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:16.780]  They say well, we support your decision. We support your decision. What is that? What do you mean you support my decision?
[01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:20.060]  You support I didn't just decide to abort a baby
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:24.220]  I decided i'm going to support a man that's doing a great job as president like oh
[01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:27.580]  We support your decision like it's some sort of outlandish decision. So
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.500]  And but they don't even see it. That's the craziest part about it. Here they are
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.780]  Engaging in the thought control
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:40.700]  Engaging in the cult mindset if you're black you have to hate Trump
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:45.900]  And then they're going to sit here and cry racism in america as they
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:50.140]  Are telling Kanye how to think and feel because he's black
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.940]  This is what i'm saying society logic and reasoning
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:01.740]  And common sense are just somehow they just evaporated from people and it's just like everything like it
[01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:05.580]  Instinct and common sense and logic and reasoning is just totally gone
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:11.820]  And it's all propaganda based thought control like you don't you don't think with your gut
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:16.620]  You don't listen to your instincts. You don't follow logic and reasoning
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:20.700]  You go with whatever propaganda has been implanted in your mind
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:26.460]  It is total mind control and that's what Kanye West is saying. He's saying look you are in
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:31.420]  Mind control you are in 1984 mind control
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:38.220]  And he's sitting there showing them it illustrating it they engage in it and they don't get it
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.860]  Maybe slowly but surely they'll start to get it. Maybe that fluoride shell
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:51.340]  Around their brain can crack. Maybe they can see the propaganda. Maybe they can be woke
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:57.340]  Now is the time 68 days till midterms
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:06.300]  Let's talk tough. Let's talk comfort. Let's talk about down home value made in the usa blue jeans

[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:39.580]  Check out the bodies and infowarstore.com. But the reason why I wanted to plug these things
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:42.780]  It's it's also just a coincidence. We have them both on sale, but
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:46.080]  I'm somebody that is very physically active
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:54.000]  And while I'm still I people still say I'm young. I'm getting up there 29 years in age and I'm starting to experience some of the
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.280]  aches and pains if you will of a
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.120]  Body that hasn't been at rest for 29 years on earth
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.160]  And so last night I'm playing basketball and I had an ankle roll
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.440]  I actually had somebody land on my ankle and it got twisted
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.560]  and it it wasn't so bad, but
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.840]  When this when this has happened to me in the past the inflammation usually
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.440]  Comes up immediately and lasts a couple days
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.080]  And it's it's a little more painful
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.000]  Well last night when I got home after playing basketball and rolling my ankle
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:33.040]  I did a bone broth shake and I doubled up on my bodies
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.920]  Inflammation gone this morning
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.440]  100% gone when I went to bed last night inflammation. I didn't even have time to ice it
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.560]  When I woke up after doing two bodies and a bone broth shake last night
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.560]  The inflammation is gone this morning and there's barely any pain
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.800]  And I'm just saying for bodies. I'm telling you for somebody who
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.040]  Who works out and experiences the soreness the next day
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:06.800]  And then works out experiences the soreness the next day after taking bodies after the workout the difference is incredible
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:12.160]  And it's that pure turmeric that we have in bodies that makes it so great
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:17.440]  It's 50% off at infowarstore.com. So is the ultimate bone broth get to infowarstore.com

[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:38.400]  All right, let me get into some news before Mike Adams Stewart Rhodes joined me in studio
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:42.080]  And then Mike Adams takes over the fourth hour
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.880]  Let me just get into this
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:47.120]  so
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.360]  You know, you're not supposed to trash the dead and I get it and you know, John McCain may he rest
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.400]  But I think that the ultimate
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:03.120]  Final karma which is perfect for John McCain who in my view
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:08.240]  Was a warmonger and a traitor to this country and an ISIS sympathizer
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:12.080]  I mean, it's to me. Those are all unarguable
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.640]  but to me
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:22.240]  The ultimate final justice for John McCain the ultimate final karma for the life and times of John McCain
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.680]  As they are having his funeral service right now
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.920]  And you know, it's a big television event
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.920]  For a guy who literally went over to Syria to sympathize with ISIS folks. I mean, you look I'm not
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:41.280]  I'm not gonna get all upset. The guy's dead now, but it's just ridiculous
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.320]  Larry Fitzgerald
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.840]  Arguably the best wide receiver in FL history giving a speech right now played a long time for the Arizona Cardinals had a relationship with McCain
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.320]  He has a lot of respect for veterans. So
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.320]  But it's just like the guy, I mean
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:02.800]  But again, you know what? I'm not gonna sit here and trash McCain. Everybody knows his past and and and what he did and
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:09.120]  His daddy and how he covered up the the information to be released from the vietnamese prison camps
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:15.840]  So that people couldn't see the truth about his time there. So the guy meeting with syrian rebels aka isis
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.480]  It's really sick twisted stuff. I mean, it's no good to me
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.960]  But I won't sit here and really trash the dead, but I'll just say this
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.560]  the final karma to me for john mccain
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.680]  is
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.200]  threefold
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.720]  Exposing who he really was and who the media really is a
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:42.240]  Who is john mccain really well even from the grave
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.920]  He decides to try to divide and trash this country by taking cheap shots at president trump and his supporters
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.240]  Even from the grave in his final words
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:56.160]  John mccain has to take cheap shots at this country and try to divide this country based on lies and propaganda
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.360]  So to me that's that's karma. John mccain showing you his true colors even from the crypt
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.520]  Then you have sarah palin not even invited
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.160]  to john mccain's funeral
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.360]  Wait a second sarah palin is the woman that stood by your side and ran
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:19.520]  As your vice president during your campaign and then you're just going to trash her because she won't come out as anti trump
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.920]  Again shows you the true colors
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.120]  But in the final
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.680]  In the final karma stage
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:29.840]  to me
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.840]  for john mccain may he rest
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.920]  Is the fact that it has totally exposed how fake
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.720]  the media really is
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.960]  if you go back
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.280]  To when mccain was running for office
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:54.640]  And you look at what cnn and msnbc and abc and cbs news and nbc news and you look at how they covered mccain
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.920]  It was it wasn't obviously to the extent trump, but oh they went after mccain
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.440]  Oh mccain was the worst mccain was the bad guy mccain was this mccain was that
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:08.800]  It's a i mean you can imagine
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:14.640]  Oh, but what happens? Now he's anti trump
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.000]  A democrat with a republican behind his name
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:22.640]  And now the media loves john mccain
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:31.200]  abc news nbc news cbs cnn msnbc a hero john mccain a war hero
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:37.520]  Funny he wasn't a war hero during the 2008 presidential campaign
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.880]  He was just like every other president
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:48.400]  Running every other person running against a democrat a racist a bigot a homophobe a warmonger a neocon a war hawk a war criminal
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:55.120]  Oh, but then he comes out as anti trump and now he's the good guy. He's a war hero. He's a hero
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.400]  He's the one to finally stand up to trump
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:06.240]  So to me john mccain may he rest there's the ben garrison cartoon
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.440]  Flying his jet right into hell
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.240]  but no
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:18.080]  To me the john mccain karma is him showing his true colors from the crypt
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.600]  Insulting america and trump one more time from the grave
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:32.240]  Them not allowing palin at the funeral and then the left-wing media the liberal media in this country that bashed and hated john mccain
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.120]  Comes out and says he's a hero now
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:37.760]  showing you how fake
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.120]  And fraudulent the fake media really is
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]  And if you're a cue listener
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:50.480]  If you are a cue fanatic and you believe the conspiracy theories from cue john mccain was actually
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.800]  Put down by trump for for high treason. That's the cue conspiracy
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:03.120]  The scientists at info wars life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support

[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:28.160]  You're listening to the alex jones show and now your host owin troyer
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:47.280]  The story is on info wars.com headline
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:53.920]  College says 9 11 memorial posters offensive to muslim students
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:00.080]  You know, maybe I should just start hammering this every day because it's it really is unbelievable
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:03.520]  Because
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.200]  At a certain level i'm not saying I agree with that i'm saying
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:17.200]  At a certain level you you actually need to hear this argument because there's a bigger issue at hand. Let me explain
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:20.080]  On september 11th
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.200]  2001 what happened?
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.640]  The biggest news event in modern history
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:33.760]  The biggest news event in my life the most world landscape changing event in modern history
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.320]  But until maybe donald trump
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:43.200]  So mckelthalen has the story college says 9 11 memorial posters offensive to muslim students, but wait a second
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.840]  We were told the official narrative from our government
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:55.520]  Was that radical islamic terrorists who hated our way of life and hated our country wanted to kill us
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.240]  And they infiltrated us
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.680]  And they're going to keep trying to kill us and keep trying to infiltrate us
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:06.880]  This was such a big news story such a big event
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:13.840]  We changed everything in america. We changed our security apparatus. We changed out what it means to travel
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:21.120]  We went to war against radical islamic terrorists in the middle east which we haven't even stopped yet
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:24.960]  Almost 20 years of war against radical islamic terror in the middle east
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:29.440]  Trillions and trillions of dollars because radical islamic terrorists hate us
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:33.040]  Killed us on 9 11 and want to kill us every day
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.640]  I'm just telling you the official government narrative
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:39.040]  That's what we're told
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.040]  Trillions of dollars of war
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:47.040]  Huge new security apparatus because radical islamic terrorists hate us and want to kill us in our way of life
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.120]  Now again, this has never been
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:58.320]  Retracted this has never been refuted by any official government source. This has never been changed. This is still the official story
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.320]  But now here we are 15 years later. And what did they say?
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.200]  Don't be offensive to muslims
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:09.760]  Don't not allow people from muslim countries into america
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.480]  Don't have a 9 11
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:18.800]  Remember 9 11 never forget poster on campus. We don't want to be offensive to muslims. We don't want to offend
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:21.680]  muslims
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.280]  Okay, now wait a second though. I was told that muslims hate me
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:30.240]  I was told that muslims hate my way of life. I was told that muslims want to kill me
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:37.360]  I was told that muslims killed 3 000 people on september 11th, which is now tallied up to 15 000 people in the aftermath
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  Was that not muslims?
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.160]  Was that not radical terror?
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:45.600]  Is this honestly not one of the biggest
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:48.480]  brain twisting double standard
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:54.880]  1984 lunatic eurasia wars that you've ever heard of that exists right now in reality
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:02.800]  And now the crew is pulling up other stories muslims complaining about 9 11 memorials. So was it muslims or not?
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.880]  Why can't we get down to the bottom of this if we're gonna say?
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:11.600]  Don't be an islamophobe
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:16.320]  Let all the muslims in don't hate shreya law don't muslims aren't bad
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:20.320]  Let them have 50 000 people at us bank stadium and chant alahu akbar
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:26.400]  Let them have their call to prayer in the streets of new york and shut down traffic and and and do their thing and face
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:29.200]  Uh, whatever it is mecca
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.960]  And and don't report on the extreme muslim compound in new mexico
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:37.440]  Which i've got new news on
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:43.120]  Don't report on the radical islamic terror happening in europe or united states. Don't be offended. Don't be offensive to muslims
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:46.560]  Don't you see how you're being an islamophobe? Don't you see how you're being racist?
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.280]  And again, it's like
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:53.600]  Okay, fine, but what happened on september 1st? What happened on september 11 2001?
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:00.080]  Was it radical islamic terror or was it not were we lied to about that or were we not? What happened at building seven?
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:06.480]  So this is honestly one of my biggest frustrations when it comes to this and i think it's a complex issue
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.720]  And there's multiple angles and levels to this
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:15.760]  But just think about how insane it is think about the total
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.760]  I don't even know it not not necessarily hypocrisy or irony. Just
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.720]  ludicrous nature
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:28.560]  Of blaming radical islamic terrorists for 9-11. They hate our way of life. They want to kill us all
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:33.440]  We have to go and and spend trillions and trillions of dollars and occupy the middle east and bring in the poppy seeds
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.360]  It's all going on because of the radical the war on radical islamic terror
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:42.960]  Which is happening in the middle east destroying the middle east, but then here in america where apparently they killed 15 000 of us and continue to
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:45.920]  Engage in acts of terror. We're not allowed to talk about them
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.240]  They now run our lives tell us we can and can't have memorials
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:56.400]  Tell us what we can and can't have on college campuses forcing the hijab on us as a freedom as a symbol of women's freedom
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:03.920]  Even though it's the exact opposite forcing lend us our sore on us the the the the literal translation for beautiful cockroach
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:10.000]  So what the hell is going on with this? Can we please get to the bottom of this? I would like to know as an american
[01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:14.800]  If it was radical islamic terrorists that hate our way of life and want to kill us
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.120]  That we spent trillions and trillions of dollars on a war against terrorism and we're still engaged in this war to this day
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:25.040]  Almost 20 years now. If that's the case if that's the truth
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:28.960]  How come we're letting muslims flood into this country?
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:34.880]  How come we're letting muslims now dictate what memorials we have what we what we have on college campuses?
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:40.400]  And how come we have a media that won't report on muslims and we're not allowed to talk about it?
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:46.560]  I'm not even giving you any an opinion. I'm not even sharing with you my opinion on this matter
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:53.680]  I'm simply laying out for you the current reality of the situation where we're told radical islamic terrorists are our enemy
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:59.760]  They want to kill all of us. They're responsible for 9-11 and then out of the other side of the mouth. We're told don't be an islamic
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:04.560]  Don't be racist against muslims. Don't report on the muslim crime. Let them all in
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:11.520]  If that isn't 1984 double think crazed level society of hysteria and propaganda and nonsense. I don't know what is
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:14.800]  If you can't look
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.360]  compare and contrast
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:23.680]  9-11 and what we're told about 9-11 and the aftermath of 9-11 versus today what we're told about muslims
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:27.280]  What we're told we can't say about muslims and what we allow muslims to do
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:29.920]  It doesn't add up folks
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:36.720]  It doesn't add up again. It's the same thing. I was talking about earlier logic reasoning common sense
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.320]  Gone
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:42.320]  the memory of the past
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:48.000]  Common sense gone the memory of a goldfish
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.880]  So what are the people going to say now I genuinely asked these people that say don't be islamophobic
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.160]  Because look I I don't believe the official narrative of 9-11. Are you kidding me?
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:03.880]  I don't believe the official narrative of 9-11 for one second
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:09.480]  And I used to think people that thought 9-11 was a conspiracy. I used to think they were nuts
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:15.000]  But you know what then I did my own research and I realized you're nuts if you believe the official story
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:17.400]  That's the nut that that's the people that are nuts
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:24.360]  It folks so so you know what here here's how I'll conclude this segment because I didn't even get to the news
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:35.160]  I really believe if and I don't know how much trump knows about this or has any interest in this he is a new yorker he is in the
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:38.520]  um
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:40.360]  Industry of building
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:46.400]  skyscrapers and buildings like this and he's made other he's made certain comments and done certain things that would indicate he's
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:49.880]  skeptical skeptical of the official narrative of 9-11, but I
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.880]  Truly believe and I'm not sitting here claiming to know the answer folks a lot of people think they know the answer
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:59.800]  I don't know what happened on 9-11. I know that we were lied to that's what I know
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:06.860]  And I know that it was a staged event to change the course of human history and america
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:11.420]  And it did and we were lied to about it and we're still lied to about it
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:17.260]  And if you can't see how we were lied to about it based on the way we approach and treat muslims now
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:22.060]  I don't know what else will show you if it was really muslims that hated our way of life
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:26.700]  All of them and wanted to kill all of us. Why do we open our doors for them?
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:31.820]  Why do we not talk about them on mainstream news because why do you so so?
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:40.300]  Let me just if we could find out the truth about 9-11. I think it would change it would it would help this earth so
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:42.940]  So much it would be more
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:51.660]  It's almost like and it's impossible to do these days because of the the
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:58.300]  Conditioning we're under and the short attention span, but it's almost like we need to sit here every day and just pound 9-11 truth
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.220]  and use
[01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:02.220]  that paradigm
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:04.620]  That I broke down in this segment to expose it
[01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.700]  If radical islamic terrorists were responsible for 9-11
[01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.220]  And we have never stopped that war that we started in response to it
[01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:17.020]  How come today in america we open our doors to muslims if you don't want that?
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:22.780]  You're considered a racist bigot islamophobe and you're not even allowed to report on crimes where someone
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:25.740]  Chants allahu akbar and stab someone to death
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:29.820]  You see something doesn't add up here folks
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:35.980]  Winter people in america going to start looking at these formulas that we're told to accept
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:41.980]  As 2 plus 2 equals 5 and say wait a second 2 plus 2 doesn't equal 5 something's afoot here
[01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:46.140]  When will we break the conditioning break the conditioning?

[02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:36.220]  I promise I am going to get to all the news I have on my desk in the next segment, but
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:43.100]  I just wanted to mention a couple events here on the alex jones show before I move on
[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.660]  because I'd like to
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:49.980]  Have a large attendance at these events
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:53.660]  First we have the free alex jones rally

[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:36.780]  Should you attend also?
[02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:42.060]  I have organized the stop government funding of abortion protests
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:50.620]  This is a little bit more out november 10th saturday november 10th at 1 p.m. At the south austin planned parent hood
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:53.740]  Stop government funding of planned parent hood, you know
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:02:01.740]  If we can't change the rovers wade results, which i'm not sure ever will be changed if we can't make abortion illegal in this country
[02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:03.740]  Which i'm not sure if we will ever be able to
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.380]  We should
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:07.580]  For certain
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:11.260]  stop taxpayer dollars from funding abortion
[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:14.140]  And it's worse than that folks
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:17.180]  It's so illegal not only
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:24.220]  Do taxpayer dollars go to planned parent hood that funds abortion planned parent hood also funds the democrat party ladies and gentlemen
[02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:31.820]  So taxpayer dollars goes to the democrat party. Do you understand how illegal that is the fact that we put up with that is?
[02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:34.860]  unreal
[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:36.860]  It is unreal
[02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:40.140]  What did they put like a
[02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:42.940]  What was the tax that they put on t?
[02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:44.780]  What was it like?
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:46.780]  like 17
[02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:53.340]  1775 when they when they put out the t tax. What was the t tax somebody looked this up for me?
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:59.580]  Look up what the t tax was. I think it was in 1775 when they when they when the brish
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:02.380]  royal government
[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:08.540]  Just announced the new t tax and it was like double what the t tax was
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:12.780]  And the reason i want to highlight this is because i want to show you
[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:15.420]  the boston t party
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:16.540]  which
[02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:18.060]  spurred
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:20.300]  america's revolution in many ways
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:23.180]  was over
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:27.740]  Like one percent of what america puts up with these days
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:30.700]  One percent a mere fraction
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:32.700]  these people
[02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:34.620]  these people rallied
[02:03:34.620 --> 02:03:41.420]  And rebelled and and changed the world over one small t tax at the time
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:43.580]  we put up with
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:48.780]  Thousands of tiny little t taxes that the government just tries to destroy and control our lives with
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:51.740]  They take your money
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:58.540]  And they fund planned parenthood and then planned parenthood funds the democrat party ladies and gentlemen
[02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:05.020]  We that should be total abandonment of the democrat party total abandonment of planned parenthood
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:07.820]  In fact, we should stop even paying our taxes
[02:04:08.860 --> 02:04:10.860]  That would be america awakened
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:17.580]  That would be america in control. That would be the republic. That would be 1776. That would be patriotism
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:24.780]  Oh, but now we're all brainwashed and the federal government's in control pay your taxes fund planned parenthood. Yes
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:27.500]  Fund the democrat party. Don't raise a stink about it
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:31.660]  We're gonna steal your money and we're gonna abort babies. We're gonna kill americans
[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:35.820]  We're gonna fund the democrat party that divides this country as an anti american. That's what we do
[02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:38.540]  If america was awake
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:43.180]  I wouldn't we shouldn't even be paying a damn tax right now because it goes to the democrat party
[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:50.620]  You are you have no choice in this country to fund the democrat party. Stop funding planned parenthood
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:52.860]  Stop funding planned parenthood
[02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:59.740]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:03.020]  The real drama can be found here in leilani estates
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:05.980]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:09.260]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:12.620]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:20.940]  And acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:28.620]  Alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:36.220]  Next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:39.820]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:45.100]  As it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:50.700]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:58.700]  But more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:12.700]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with oen treuer

[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:48.780]  All right, I've got a lot of news that I still need to cover
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:53.660]  And I don't even know where to begin really so I'm just going to just just
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:56.540]  Just dive into the first stack that I see here
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:59.020]  uh, okay
[02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:04.060]  This was a tweet from Donald Trump today, which I didn't get notified even though I have notifications on what's going on twitter
[02:09:05.820 --> 02:09:07.580]  Statement from the white house
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:12.460]  President Donald j. Trump feels strongly that north korea is under tremendous pressure from china
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:17.260]  Because of our major trade disputes with the chinese government at the same time
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:22.860]  We also know that china is providing north korea with considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and other
[02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.180]  Commodities this is not helpful
[02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:29.580]  Nonetheless, the president believes that his relationship with kim jong-un is a very good and warm one
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:34.220]  And there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint us south korea war games
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:36.220]  Which they have ratcheted back
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:38.700]  besides the president can
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:43.900]  Instantly start the joint exercises again with south korea and japan if he so chooses if he does there will be far
[02:09:43.900 --> 02:09:47.260]  Bigger than ever before as for the u.s. China trade disputes and other
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:55.500]  Differences they will be resolved in time by president trump and china's great president jijing ping the relationship and bond remain very strong
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:58.620]  I want to point out a couple important things about this tweet
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:07.340]  One notice how he's telling you what we've been reporting and very few others in the media understand this dynamic folks
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:11.180]  Very few others in the media understand this dynamic and and honestly it's just
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:15.100]  An illustration of how shallow television news is
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:21.740]  But let me explain to you as the headline on the washington post says trump is blaming china for north korea impasse
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:23.580]  folks
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:25.580]  china controls north korea
[02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:27.740]  china
[02:10:27.740 --> 02:10:29.900]  I won't say runs north korea, but basically
[02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:33.500]  north korea is china china's junkyard dog
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:39.420]  Where trump starts to approach the trade deals with china what happens north korea starts barking
[02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:42.460]  And says whoa now we got to deal with this junkyard dog
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.260]  It's always been that way
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:48.620]  And again the guests that we have at info wars
[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:54.220]  And and the the experts on this this is one of the only sources that's going to break this dynamic down
[02:10:55.820 --> 02:10:59.260]  China pretty much controls north korea north korea wouldn't be able
[02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:04.700]  Probably even to fuel its country power itself get anything done if it wasn't for china
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:07.340]  So if china says bark
[02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:09.340]  North korea will bark
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:14.700]  So trump is trying to get that out to the public with this tweet
[02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:18.620]  While maintaining positive public
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:20.620]  appearance
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:22.620]  As far as the relations are concerned
[02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:27.580]  With zhijian ping and with kim jong-un, but you have to understand chinese politics
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:30.140]  They want hardball
[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:37.180]  They only respect you if you play hardball that that's basic asian politics and and specifically chinese politics
[02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:41.260]  So when zhijian ping tells his junkyard dog to bark
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:44.460]  And north korea barks and if trump
[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:50.060]  Settles down and and meeks to the dog then china disrespects trump and says america weak
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:56.220]  If trump stands up to the dog and says i don't think so i know china's telling you to bark china says, hmm, okay
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:58.620]  We respect this man
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:12:04.540]  And there's your difference between obama and trump obama china had zero respect for by the end of obama's presidency
[02:12:04.780 --> 02:12:08.460]  They weren't even rolling up a tarmac for him or they weren't even rolling up uh
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:13.260]  Stairs for him to get out of his airplane. He had to get out on the butt of the airplane
[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:20.060]  Chant trump comes to china there's a parade there's an entire event
[02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:27.900]  Music theatrical experiences the red carpet ceremonies long walks for the media to record
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:29.900]  Obama comes to china
[02:12:32.220 --> 02:12:34.220]  Now the other important thing about this tweet
[02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:40.700]  You had china and russia engage in joint military
[02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:46.140]  For uh joint military drills yesterday the biggest ever
[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:51.580]  Russia really showing its military strength china really showing its military strength
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:54.700]  You should see the video from these military drills folks
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:13:00.460]  And for the first time ever mongolia joined in on the drills so trump
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:02.940]  points out
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:05.820]  Having us war games with south korea and japan again
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:08.620]  that's him
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:11.660]  Again signaling to you and signaling to china
[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:17.100]  I know what you did with those war games. We saw it. We could do it too
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:20.460]  But let me tell you
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:29.260]  This was no this was no ho hum drill that russia and china did folks. This was war games russia and china
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:32.060]  This was a display for the world
[02:13:32.620 --> 02:13:35.020]  This was a display for america to see
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:39.340]  And this was a little bit of a message to america too
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:43.020]  You better realize obama really depleted your military
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:50.060]  You know you can sit here with the hubris because of past history and the might of the american soldier and the commitment and bravery that you
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:57.420]  Just assume you're the military power china and russia with these war games are trying to strike fear into america to say hey
[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:03.820]  We are the most powerful military on earth. You better check yourself america and you can thank obama for that
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:11.580]  So understand that that's what's going on so for trump trump to respond and to say we'll engage in war games again
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:13.420]  That's trump saying look
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:15.420]  We saw you
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:18.620]  And the american people better wake up
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:21.340]  And realize what's going on
[02:14:21.340 --> 02:14:27.180]  If you if the democrats and the media in this country are really going to push war with russia. Guess what?
[02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:29.900]  That's going to include china
[02:14:30.060 --> 02:14:34.700]  And we don't want that did you see the joint military drills? Do you have any idea?
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:37.420]  How many people live in china?
[02:14:38.220 --> 02:14:40.220]  Do you even have a clue?

[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:59.580]  The average democrat the average liberal on tv probably don't even know about the joint military drills that happened

[02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:30.860]  And where's america?

[02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:23.820]  Broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host
[02:20:23.820 --> 02:20:25.820]  So enjoy it
[02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:27.820]  All right, i'm gonna do a news blitz here
[02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:36.540]  On the alex jones show before mike adams and stewart rode's join me in studio and mike adams takes over in the fourth hour
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:44.140]  Mueller's revenge special counsel won't rule out going after manifold in third trial
[02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:47.580]  So they're still going after manifold politico has a story
[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:53.740]  Mueller wants to review emails between manifold and his former lawyer now. Let me explain what this is all about
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:21:00.540]  You say well, they already got manifold. Why are they still going after manifold folks? You don't get it. This is not about manifold
[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:08.300]  The whole reason why they're doing this just look at michael cohen. What did cohen say?
[02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:12.220]  Cohen came out and said yep
[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:14.860]  Trump did this trump was bad
[02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:18.700]  He told me to do this and then what happened to the media prints the story
[02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:21.500]  trump told cohen to
[02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:29.180]  He knew about russian media trump told calling this so it's not about it's not about whatever crimes were there or weren't there
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.180]  or any russian collusion it's all about
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:38.700]  Getting these people to say trump is bad so that they can print up a dozen media stories and and in their echo chamber
[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:43.820]  Continue the false narrative the false consensus that trump bad trump the trump rusher probe is real
[02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:49.820]  It's all fake. So they're going to keep going after manifold until he makes a public statement demonizing trump
[02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:51.820]  That's what this is all about
[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:53.820]  It's like with michael cohen
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.820]  Michael cohen says yes trump is guilty
[02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:00.860]  of telling me to pay them off
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:06.060]  Trump is guilty and so what does it mean to say trump guilty cohen says trump guilty. It's not a crime
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:11.020]  That's like saying i'm guilty of starting my car before i went to work
[02:22:11.020 --> 02:22:13.020]  There's no crime
[02:22:14.140 --> 02:22:16.140]  So they make it out as it's some sort of crime
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:20.940]  Michael cohen says trump guilty. They published a story. No crime
[02:22:21.660 --> 02:22:23.660]  No real story
[02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:27.100]  So they got what they wanted out of cohen. They haven't got what they wanted out of manifold
[02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:28.220]  So this is going to keep going
[02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:32.140]  Yeah, we're just going to keep going after you manifold until you come out and make a public statement trump bad
[02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:34.780]  Till you say trump is guilty. Doesn't matter what?
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:41.660]  Trump did trump tie his shoes this morning. Trump is guilty. There it is. They published a story trump guilty says manifold
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:44.940]  Former former trump campaign
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:49.420]  Former head of the trump campaign says trump guilty. That's all they want
[02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:56.460]  Do you realize how sick these people are? They are ruining people's lives. They are ruining and dividing this country
[02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:00.620]  Everything they're doing folks. It's it's so disgusting
[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:07.820]  All just so they can print a fake news story to try to take trump down. They are destroying a man's life
[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:13.580]  Just to print a fake news story and take trump down. Do you realize how sick and twisted these people are?
[02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:21.180]  Child abuse charges dropped against new mexico jihadist after screw-up
[02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:25.020]  so i did a little more research to this i talked to a couple lawyers and
[02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:29.500]  They disagreed with me. I said look, I feel like a judge
[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:36.460]  Would extend the 10-day period and find a loophole around this and the lawyer said well, you know
[02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:39.580]  It could happen. It does happen, but actually
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:44.060]  In this case the judge emilio chavez did the right thing
[02:23:45.580 --> 02:23:49.740]  Because that was the law and so they said yeah, there's cases where that happens
[02:23:49.740 --> 02:23:52.860]  But but but technically you know this judge is actually doing the right thing
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:57.740]  The person to be upset with here is the prosecuting attorney. Well, the prosecuting attorney is john lovelace
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:00.780]  And it was john lovelace that didn't produce
[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:03.740]  um
[02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:06.060]  The evidence in time because of the 10-day rule
[02:24:06.060 --> 02:24:11.260]  So if you're going to be upset with anyone you'd be upset with the prosecuting attorney john john lovelace, but my hope is
[02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:18.940]  There's something else here because there's other charges that could be brought up against the three that that that aren't brought up yet
[02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:22.860]  Uh, but this whole story is just it's really just crazy
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:27.580]  Not as I mean folks training 11 children
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:31.500]  To shoot up schools and hospitals in america
[02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:38.620]  Just got a radical islamic jihadist. Okay fine. You don't want to talk about it fine. Call them radical humans
[02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:41.020]  Why won't you cover the story?
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:42.540]  They
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:44.540]  Do you like do people even know this story?
[02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:47.500]  A three-year-old boy goes missing
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:54.780]  The fbi begins a search for the three-year-old boy. It leads them to this compound where they find
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:25:01.740]  Radical terrorists training children to shoot schools and hospitals and they engaged in a
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:04.540]  religious ritualistic
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:11.020]  Sacrifice of the three-year-old boy that they were originally looking for that led them to this compound and they said they they
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:17.820]  Ritualistically killed that boy to then tell the students that he would be their guiding light
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:23.820]  He would be basically their god when they go in and shoot people at hospitals and at schools
[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:30.220]  I mean this should be lock them up and throw away the key, but the media won't even cover it
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:34.700]  And you just have to ask why
[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:40.460]  The media could make this the biggest story in America if they wanted. Look at what they did for stormy daniels
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:42.940]  Look what they did for amorosa. By the way
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:46.380]  Amorosa
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:48.460]  Amorosa

[02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:55.260]  Where's Amorosa?
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:26:00.140]  What happened to Amorosa bomb show Amorosa book Amorosa
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:05.180]  Amorosa to bring Trump down with new book. Oops
[02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:08.380]  not
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:09.900]  Amorosa
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:11.900]  Amorosa
[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:13.500]  Bueller
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:15.500]  Bueller
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:19.420]  Do you see how fake this entire brigade attacking Trump is?
[02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:24.300]  Do you remember it? What was it like last week? Amorosa's new book. She got him Trump racist
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:29.100]  Amorosa breaking Trump down Amorosa to take Trump down Amorosa's new book. She's a guest over here
[02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:32.540]  She's a guest over here. She's a guest over here. She's got a new show over here. She's the biggest story
[02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:35.100]  Amorosa's new book. Will it take down Trump finally?
[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:39.820]  Amorosa the black woman that will destroy Trump from within. She's got the details. It's all in the book
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.660]  Amorosa
[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:45.660]  Bueller
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:50.620]  Nothing I guess you failed again
[02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:55.580]  Shame shame shame
[02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:57.580]  All right
[02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:01.180]  This one is a doozy
[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:06.780]  This comes from slate the one place where alex jones will never be banned
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:10.780]  Sure, the conspiracy theorist is being de-platformed left and right
[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:14.460]  But if you drive around america, you're going to run into him
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:17.580]  I am
[02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:19.020]  amazed
[02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:21.020]  At this story from slate
[02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:24.940]  And so they highlight how we have these bumper stickers
[02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:29.740]  And there's these subreddit groups where people tweet out their cars
[02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:32.940]  and how they've basically
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:38.620]  Put a bunch of info war stickers on their cars, you know flared it up with
[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:41.260]  with info war swag
[02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:47.500]  And so they put it out there and the story in slate like oh you can't uh alex jones crazy fans support
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:52.540]  I was put bumper stickers on cars and I'm sitting here and I'm like oh my gosh. First of all
[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:57.900]  I'm curious if this isn't and maybe I'm maybe I'm getting full of myself here
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:05.580]  But I'm curious if this isn't a direct response to my announcement of the info wars army where I specifically said
[02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:12.540]  Because they're blocking us in the digital world because they're not allowing us to red pill people in the digital world
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:19.260]  I'm taking it to the 3d world and I'm engaging other info warriors to do so and then it just so happens the same week
[02:28:19.340 --> 02:28:25.580]  I announced that slate is warning you alex jones will never be banned in the 3d world. That's right
[02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:28.060]  We're coming for it. You know what?
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:30.780]  Here's what they're doing
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:38.140]  They're banning you from redpilling people on the digital platform. So we have to red pill red pill people in the 3d platform
[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:41.740]  That's what they're doing right now. And so we will
[02:28:42.700 --> 02:28:47.740]  And they're and they don't know what to do because guess what they may control the digital world
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:49.820]  They may think they're god in the digital world
[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:54.780]  But the real god controls the real world the real god is in control of the 3d realm

[02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:11.500]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here, but I'll say uh
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:24.780]  That the press is not the enemy of the people
[02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:28.780]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:30.780]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:33:32.780 --> 02:33:34.780]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:54.780]  They came in peace.
[02:33:54.780 --> 02:34:00.780]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:06.780]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:32.780]  This is CNN.
[02:34:36.780 --> 02:34:40.780]  All right, welcome back. You know, it's funny watching that video.
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:57.780]  There's a moment where Brooke Baldwin is talking to Jim Acosta and she has like that look like like you know that look with like like teenage girls or like college age girls when there's like a little boy who can like, you know, a little child that can dance really well or like is really cute like child, you know,
[02:34:57.780 --> 02:35:05.780]  Oh, he's so cute like I just want to pat him on the head. That's the look that Brooke Baldwin has for Jim Acosta right there. Yeah, yeah, roll the B roll.
[02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:12.780]  Look at tell me Brooke Baldwin's face isn't like the college student that thinks you know that the her niece is like the cutest thing ever.
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:13.780]  Well, look at her face right there.
[02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:17.780]  Oh, Jim Acosta, little Jimmy.
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:20.780]  Oh, little Jimmy just want to pat him on the head.
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:22.780]  She's agreeing with you.
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:32.780]  So it's just funny to me that's that's CNN Mike Adams comes comes and does a drive and just comes right down and sits in studio.
[02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:34.780]  No makeup for you. No review of the teleprompter.
[02:35:34.780 --> 02:35:35.780]  Here we are.
[02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:36.780]  Exactly.
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:40.780]  Yeah, but I was thinking on the drive in I was thinking about the potential for chaos after the election.
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:44.780]  I mean, the regardless of which way the election goes, I mean, think about it.
[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:53.780]  If the Republicans keep the House, then the Democrats go even more insane than they have been already. They go ape insane with violence.
[02:35:53.780 --> 02:35:56.780]  But maybe Trump is more empowered to do something about it.
[02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:58.780]  Well, we would hope so.
[02:35:58.780 --> 02:36:01.780]  But if the Democrats take the House, then what do we have?
[02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:03.780]  Democrats try to impeach Trump.
[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:04.780]  No doubt that's coming.
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:10.780]  And then we're going to have a massive backlash by the Patriots who are tired of their country being stolen from them.
[02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:14.780]  They're tired of this coup attempt. They're tired of the fake news media.
[02:36:14.780 --> 02:36:19.780]  They're tired of being called Nazis and being insulted and spat upon every day.
[02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:20.780]  You don't like being called a Nazi?
[02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:21.780]  Yeah, right. Exactly.
[02:36:21.780 --> 02:36:25.780]  Oh, I mean, there are people who are fed up with what's going on.
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:27.780]  I mean, you're probably one of them.
[02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:29.780]  Well, it's like what Alex said in one of his new promos.
[02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:33.780]  It's like if you actually war game it all out, there is no victory for these people.
[02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:37.780]  I mean, honestly, the only victory is total death.
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:44.780]  I know if they get what they want, they get a communist country where half of them eventually get thrown in their own gulags.
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:47.780]  You know, where the police state terrorist rules over them.
[02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:50.780]  Mass death. I mean, it's population control. That's what it's all about.
[02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:56.780]  Exactly. Here's the thing. Why are these people on the left begging for their own destruction?
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:37:05.780]  I mean, think about the level of brainwashing that has taken place where they have been convinced that begging for their own destruction is a pathway to utopia.
[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:07.780]  How twisted is that, man?
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:09.780]  Well, I'll tell you what, let's go into the mind of the twisted.
[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:10.780]  You want to go into the mind of the twisted?
[02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:12.780]  Okay, let's go into the mind of the insane.
[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:16.780]  You know, luckily one thing about Twitter is you can go into the mind of the mentally deranged.
[02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:21.780]  You can go into the mind of the Trump derangement syndrome victims by just looking at their responses to stuff.
[02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:23.780]  In fact, I want to do it more often because it's so entertaining.
[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:26.780]  But all right, this is from Vox today. This is a real tweet, by the way.
[02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:28.780]  Oh, real tweet from Vox.
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:30.780]  First of all, I'm looking at the picture.
[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:37.780]  First of all, they already complained about animal crackers having the zoo animals in like the zoo type cages.
[02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:44.780]  So Barnum's Animal Crackers had to change their box logo that they've had for decades because it was PETA.
[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:47.780]  PETA complained that it was animal cruelty.
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:53.780]  So now they have a new box where the animals are free and roaming and, you know, okay, new look, same great taste, says Nabisco.
[02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:55.780]  But look at what the left says.
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:57.780]  Vox.com tweets out,
[02:37:57.780 --> 02:38:05.780]  The new Nabisco Animal Crackers art doesn't address any of the underlying issues about ethics, exploitation, and corporate greed.
[02:38:05.780 --> 02:38:07.780]  A box of animal crackers.
[02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:13.780]  Well, the truth is they took the prison bars off the Animal Cracker box and they put it on Google.
[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:16.780]  So now the prison has just shifted. It's a prison for your mind.
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:17.780]  Yes.
[02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:21.780]  We are the animals in the cages now by the tech giants and there's no outcome.
[02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:22.780]  And they're watching us.
[02:38:22.780 --> 02:38:23.780]  Right.
[02:38:23.780 --> 02:38:24.780]  Always watching.
[02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:26.780]  We are the animals, right?
[02:38:26.780 --> 02:38:30.780]  So now they're saying, what, what, children can't even enjoy a cracker?
[02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:37.780]  No, exactly. You can't even have an Animal Cracker without the left trying to control your life.
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:40.780]  In fact, you know what, I'm going to...
[02:38:40.780 --> 02:38:44.780]  Can I get a box of Animal Crackers stat?
[02:38:44.780 --> 02:38:46.780]  Well, I'll eat one right now.
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:50.780]  I want to go to Nabisco and demand Animal Crackers decorated with a gay wedding theme.
[02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:51.780]  No, you know what?
[02:38:51.780 --> 02:38:52.780]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:57.780]  In fact, you're 100% right. I think they need to redesign their box logo and have this male line.
[02:38:57.780 --> 02:38:59.780]  Oh, I shouldn't judge the line.
[02:38:59.780 --> 02:39:03.780]  A transsexual line getting married to a bi-gender giraffe.
[02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:07.780]  Well, that would do it. Would the left be happy then?
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:13.780]  Yes, but it is cultural appropriation since you are not a lion, so now you're exploiting the animals.
[02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:15.780]  Well, who says I'm not a lion?
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:17.780]  Well, with your facial hair growing out, you might soon be.
[02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:19.780]  I might be transitioning right now.
[02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:21.780]  That's right. Are you taking lion hormones?
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:22.780]  Not yet.
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:25.780]  Well, they're available. Get on it, man. What are you waiting for?
[02:39:25.780 --> 02:39:32.780]  If I could do something about the wrongs committed by Barnum's Animal Crackers, I could maybe get something done.
[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:36.780]  I can't sleep at night. Do you know that because of...
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:41.780]  Are you having visions of your childhood Animal Cracker episodes coming back now?
[02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:42.780]  Is that what's going on?
[02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:45.780]  I feel so guilty for biting all those rhino heads off as a child now.
[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:46.780]  Oh.
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:48.780]  Okay, all right, so there's the mind of the same thing.
[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:50.780]  Well, obviously, violence against animals. There you go.
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:55.780]  This is a tweet from an ACLU attorney certified by Twitter.
[02:39:55.780 --> 02:39:57.780]  Certified Zane or what?
[02:39:57.780 --> 02:39:59.780]  No, no, no, just certified. The blue check.
[02:39:59.780 --> 02:40:00.780]  Verified.
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:03.780]  Maybe, maybe, oh, verified. Maybe certifiably insane.
[02:40:03.780 --> 02:40:06.780]  But Chase Strangio, ACLU attorney.
[02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:07.780]  Okay.
[02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:08.780]  Verified by Twitter.
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:09.780]  Okay.
[02:40:09.780 --> 02:40:12.780]  Tweets out, white people are the worst.
[02:40:12.780 --> 02:40:14.780]  No, where's the ban for him?
[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:16.780]  That couldn't be racist, could it?
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:18.780]  Judging people by the color of their skin?
[02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:20.780]  Didn't you hear you can't be racist against white people?
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:21.780]  I see.
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.780]  That's why, that's why you can, you know, steal their land and kill them in South Africa.
[02:40:25.780 --> 02:40:31.780]  So the civil liberties union now is opposed to civil liberties for people based on the color of their skin?
[02:40:31.780 --> 02:40:37.780]  Which is, I mean, white people are still the majority of the biggest group of people demographic in America.
[02:40:37.780 --> 02:40:42.780]  So, and Chase is white. They're all white. Why do white people hate white people so much?
[02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:45.780]  Well, it's like animals hate Animal Crackers. I don't know. You tell me.
[02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:47.780]  Hey, whoa, that's not true.
[02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:49.780]  Animals love Animal Crackers.
[02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:52.780]  Have you ever tried to feed like your dog Animal Crackers?
[02:40:52.780 --> 02:40:55.780]  If I admitted to that, PETA would probably come down on me.
[02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:56.780]  That's true.
[02:40:56.780 --> 02:41:01.780]  All right. So now, Los Angeles is about to introduce Obama Boulevard.
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:03.780]  Obama Boulevard coming to LA.
[02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:10.780]  Don't you think it would be a shame, Mike, if info warriors went out and, you know, maybe had a sign that said fast and furious,
[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:13.780]  maybe had a sign that said Obama started spy gate?
[02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:19.780]  Would it be a shame if people went and engaged in real world activism at that revealing of Obama Boulevard?
[02:41:19.780 --> 02:41:23.780]  Well, I think first we should find out what kind of street they're naming Obama Boulevard.
[02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:28.780]  Is it a dark alley somewhere? Because that would be the appropriate metaphor for where America is going.
[02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:32.780]  Maybe it's a dead end. It's a dark alley, dead end Obama Boulevard.
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:37.780]  This is what you get, or like a road with like a tent city on it.
[02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:42.780]  Yeah, it's just like homeless tent people. And how about, you know, feces and used heroin needles.
[02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:44.780]  Yeah, I was going to say, we should put one in San Francisco.
[02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:50.780]  Yeah, yeah, put one in San Francisco. Find the most feces ridden, needle ridden, poverty ridden street and call it Obama Boulevard.
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:51.780]  Yeah, that would make sense, actually.
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:54.780]  But stack the street with pallets of cash for Iran.
[02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:56.780]  Mm, earmarked for Iran.
[02:41:56.780 --> 02:42:02.780]  Earmarked for Iran. Please, please, airlift these cash pallets to Iran to fund nuclear weapons.
[02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:04.780]  That would be the proper street.
[02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:07.780]  And have the poor, broke homeless people do it for them.
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:08.780]  Right, right.
[02:42:08.780 --> 02:42:09.780]  For diversity.
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:16.780]  Using, like, human mules carrying pallets of cash to Iran on behalf of our dear leader, Obama.
[02:42:16.780 --> 02:42:18.780]  There you go. That's perfect.
[02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:25.780]  So there's going to be some event, I believe, for the revealing of Obama Boulevard in Los Angeles.
[02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:34.780]  So I just think it would be a terrible shame if activists showed up and started saying the truth about Obama.
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:39.780]  You know, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the cash deal to Iran.
[02:42:39.780 --> 02:42:44.780]  I just think it'd be a shame if activists showed up in the street, engaged in the real world,
[02:42:44.780 --> 02:42:49.780]  and fought in the information war against the traitorous Iraq Hussein Obama.
[02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:50.780]  I don't know. I just think it'd be a shame.
[02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:51.780]  It should be a total shame.
[02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:52.780]  I agree.
[02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:53.780]  Yeah.
[02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:54.780]  Don't do it.

[02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:16.780]  25, 50, 100, 250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists
[02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:24.780]  and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.

[02:43:57.780 --> 02:44:03.780]  First demonize info wars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that.
[02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:10.780]  Then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:11.780]  And then wallah.
[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:21.780]  Two weeks later ban info wars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top 10 news feeds.

[02:44:59.780 --> 02:45:08.780]  Years ago, info wars life created the powerful micro zx formula to help you combat internal yeast as the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment.

[02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:22.780]  Myco zx plus is the result of the search for that formula, a unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:04.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:20.780]  It's 68 days till the midterm elections. It's time to engage and I've got big plans in the works. Mike Adams in studio with me.
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:25.780]  He's going to be taking over the next hour with Stuart Rose from Oathkeepers, but we're going to banter back and forth here about a couple more news stories.
[02:47:25.780 --> 02:47:30.780]  I'll tell you what, let's go to these two because they're in the same vein.
[02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:35.780]  Police say an assassin has been arrested.
[02:47:35.780 --> 02:47:39.780]  A bounty was issued for Gert Wilders ahead of the draw Mohammed event.
[02:47:39.780 --> 02:47:45.780]  Gert Wilders, he's a Dutch politician, a nationalist.
[02:47:45.780 --> 02:47:53.780]  I just had to blank out. I believe he's a Dutch politician, a big nationalist, anti globalist candidate, pro Brexit and everything.
[02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:56.780]  And they had a plot to kill him that was exposed.
[02:47:56.780 --> 02:48:04.780]  They were arrested. And then in Mexico, Mexican cartel boss offers $100,000 for assassination of Breitbart, Texas writer.
[02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:11.780]  He was also arrested. Of course, you had have had over 100 politicians in Mexico running for office get killed.
[02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:15.780]  So this is the kind of stuff that you deal with now.
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:24.780]  If you're a, I don't even want to say conservative necessarily, but if you're a nationalist, if you're pro, you know, if you're a patriot for your country, if you're an anti globalist now,
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:32.780]  gangs and assassins are trying to kill you. I mean, what message does that convey to you, Mike Adam?
[02:48:32.780 --> 02:48:41.780]  You know, this is no joke. This Breitbart writer was put on a hit list by the Mexican drug cartel and $100,000 is a lot of money in Mexico.
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:43.780]  Oh, in Mexico, you're set, baby.
[02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:51.780]  Yeah, no, they really wanted this guy dead and he was a writer for Breitbart, but he was located in Mexico just so you know, it wasn't someone in America writing.
[02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:54.780]  It's like a million pesos. Is it?
[02:48:54.780 --> 02:48:55.780]  It might be even more.
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:49:00.780]  Well, by tonight, it might be, you know, a trillion Venezuelans.
[02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:02.780]  Argentina.
[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:05.780]  Argentina's market, they're plunging there.
[02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:06.780]  Man.
[02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:08.780]  Right. I mean, the currencies are collapsing.
[02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:16.780]  But aside from that, yeah, journalists are under attack physically when they tell the truth, they are threatened, they're death-threaded.
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:19.780]  I mean, how many of us have been death-threaded all of us at some point?
[02:49:19.780 --> 02:49:20.780]  Happens to me all the time.
[02:49:20.780 --> 02:49:28.780]  And, you know, I found it interesting, the Boston Globe did a story today where there was an arrest of a guy in California, I think, who had called the Boston Globe and threatened to kill them.
[02:49:28.780 --> 02:49:30.780]  Oh, they found out who the guy was.
[02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:31.780]  Yeah, they arrested him.
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:35.780]  But you know what? InfoWars gets those kind of threats every day.
[02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:37.780]  I just don't even care to report on it anymore, honestly.
[02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:40.780]  Where are the arrests of all the threats against us?
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:41.780]  You know what I mean?
[02:49:41.780 --> 02:49:42.780]  You know what it is, Mike?
[02:49:42.780 --> 02:49:45.780]  Here's what I've learned because of a most recent event.
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:51.780]  Unless you really want to commit to having these people arrested, which I'm not saying is a bad thing to do. It's a good thing.
[02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:53.780]  I'm glad people are doing this.
[02:49:53.780 --> 02:49:55.780]  I just don't have the time or energy and I have bigger priorities.
[02:49:55.780 --> 02:49:56.780]  Oh, here you go.
[02:49:56.780 --> 02:49:58.780]  Because here's the truth of the matter.
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:13.780]  If I wanted to go out and have and press charges against people that threaten me, I'm going to have to spend hours a day filing police reports, talking to police, gathering the evidence, following up, following up, following up, following up, just at the hopes that something will get done.
[02:50:13.780 --> 02:50:20.780]  And so for me, it's like, sometimes I'll do with the initial push, and if I don't get anything, I'll just throw my hands in and just say, alright, screw it, let's go on.
[02:50:20.780 --> 02:50:23.780]  Plus, the Boston Globe is probably a gun-free zone.
[02:50:23.780 --> 02:50:24.780]  Oh, I'm sure.
[02:50:24.780 --> 02:50:27.780]  InfoWars is not a gun-free zone. I can assure you of that.
[02:50:27.780 --> 02:50:28.780]  Not even close.
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:30.780]  Somebody tries to come in here and move away.
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:32.780]  I think there's multiple firearms just sitting around here.
[02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:33.780]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:35.780]  Locked up. We got a safe right under the desk.
[02:50:35.780 --> 02:50:37.780]  In addition to the guns that we're both wearing.
[02:50:37.780 --> 02:50:43.780]  But somebody comes in here, we don't need to call 911 except afterwards.
[02:50:43.780 --> 02:50:44.780]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:46.780]  Like, please come do the paperwork because it's over.
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:54.780]  So, you know, the Boston Globe is freaked out because they can't defend themselves and they're in a gun-free zone and some crazy wacko threatens them over the phone from California.
[02:50:54.780 --> 02:50:57.780]  He probably doesn't even have the gas money to drive across the country.
[02:50:57.780 --> 02:51:06.780]  Well, and of course, let's remember too about the coincidental nature of this where Boston Globe that very day announces the anti-Trump media push.
[02:51:06.780 --> 02:51:08.780]  As if it hadn't been going on for three years.
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:13.780]  And then that day, you know, led by the Boston Globe, everyone says, you know, Trump is bad.
[02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:20.780]  Right as they're greasing the skids to say, oh, Trump supporters are going to commit violence against the media, taking Trump words out of context.
[02:51:20.780 --> 02:51:23.780]  So I never, I thought the whole thing was a false flag.
[02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:25.780]  That arrest story is new to me.
[02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:26.780]  So I'd have to look into that.
[02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:28.780]  I'm not sure if that certifies anything.
[02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:32.780]  But then the next day you had Vogel from the New York Times play some eerie voicemail.
[02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:37.780]  He claimed he was getting threatened by, which again, I'm sorry, I'm skeptical of these people.
[02:51:37.780 --> 02:51:38.780]  They lie all day long.
[02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:39.780]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:51:39.780 --> 02:51:40.780]  They do lie all the time.
[02:51:40.780 --> 02:51:41.780]  I mean, look at Carl Bernstein.
[02:51:41.780 --> 02:51:55.780]  You know, you guys have been covering this with CNN, the outright lies of CNN, deliberate lies, not mistakes, not just careless reporting, but a lie where they fabricated a fake source and then they refused to retract it.
[02:51:55.780 --> 02:51:57.780]  Yeah, how can we trust anything the media reports?
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:51:58.780]  Who knows?
[02:51:58.780 --> 02:52:00.780]  Maybe they're setting up people to death threat themselves.
[02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:01.780]  Exactly.
[02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:04.780]  You know, that's not out of the realm of possibility here.
[02:52:04.780 --> 02:52:08.780]  What I know is that the death threats that we receive are real.
[02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:10.780]  You know, we don't have any reason to make them up.
[02:52:10.780 --> 02:52:12.780]  I mean, we don't even cover them.
[02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:13.780]  We don't even make a story out of it.
[02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:14.780]  That's true.
[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:15.780]  In most cases, that's true.
[02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:25.780]  Like I said, I don't want to, I'm sorry, I don't want to spend my day going on Twitter screenshotting all the crap I get sent, going through my text, going through my, I don't have the time for it.
[02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:29.780]  I really, you know, it's like, to me, it's not, it's not, it's like the whole thing I talked about.
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:31.780]  It's not taking the victim mentality.
[02:52:31.780 --> 02:52:36.780]  It's seeing the victim mentality that could be there and just giving it the middle finger saying, screw that.
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:41.780]  Well, how could you possibly have time for that when you're too busy biting the hippo heads off the animal crackers?
[02:52:41.780 --> 02:52:42.780]  And then putting them in cages.
[02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:43.780]  Putting them in cages.
[02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:45.780]  Yeah, that's what we're going to have to do.
[02:52:45.780 --> 02:52:50.780]  We're going to have to, maybe we should, we'll sell like an animal cracker cage now because you can't even.
[02:52:50.780 --> 02:52:52.780]  Well, what about all the other animals and food?
[02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:55.780]  I mean, aren't there, what about the rice crispy leprechauns?
[02:52:55.780 --> 02:52:57.780]  Are they being culturally exploited?
[02:52:57.780 --> 02:52:59.780]  Is there a leprechaun lobby out there?
[02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:01.780]  Well, yeah, I mean, what about the regular elves?
[02:53:01.780 --> 02:53:02.780]  Do they have work rights?
[02:53:02.780 --> 02:53:03.780]  Exactly.
[02:53:03.780 --> 02:53:04.780]  What about the elves?
[02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:05.780]  Hey, you know what?
[02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:06.780]  This is serious business.
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:09.780]  Are the elves living in the cages that are taken away from the animals now?
[02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:15.780]  We were talking about South America and so I wanted to bring up this story.
[02:53:15.780 --> 02:53:17.780]  He doesn't want to play anymore.
[02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:20.780]  Well, I've got four minutes left.
[02:53:20.780 --> 02:53:24.780]  And I wanted to get this out because we have a big audience in Brazil.
[02:53:24.780 --> 02:53:30.780]  Brazilians are very nationalistic people right now and there's a political turning happening in Brazil.
[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:33.780]  In fact, there are a lot of ways we're kindred spirits with Brazil right now.
[02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:36.780]  They've got a Yavajato going on.
[02:53:36.780 --> 02:53:39.780]  It's Operation Car Wash, which is essentially drain the swamp.
[02:53:39.780 --> 02:53:43.780]  Their last president, Lulu, was arrested and is in jail.
[02:53:43.780 --> 02:53:44.780]  Hmm, wonderful.
[02:53:44.780 --> 02:53:45.780]  Obama makes face the same thing.
[02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:47.780]  So we're actually really kindred spirits with Brazil.
[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:49.780]  They've got a big presidential election coming up.
[02:53:49.780 --> 02:53:54.780]  Jair Bolsonaro is the trumpish candidate.
[02:53:54.780 --> 02:53:59.780]  He's not exactly the same as Trump, but he's the same vein, nationalistic.
[02:53:59.780 --> 02:54:04.780]  Protect your country, borders, follow the law against government corruption.
[02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:05.780]  Well, he came out and made a statement.
[02:54:05.780 --> 02:54:11.780]  I don't know if you've been to Brazil, but the favelas in Brazil are pretty much run by the gangs.
[02:54:11.780 --> 02:54:15.780]  And you don't have gun rights in Brazil, so you can't even go into the favelas.
[02:54:15.780 --> 02:54:19.780]  And when the police go into the favelas, they have to send in the military with them,
[02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:22.780]  because that's how powerful these drug cartels are.
[02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:23.780]  They just run the whole scene.
[02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:24.780]  And it's crazy.
[02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:27.780]  I actually witnessed a couple of times, I didn't go into the favelas,
[02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:30.780]  but you see the police and the military going in whenever there's these crazy things.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:35.780]  So, so Bolsonaro says, though, let me get the exact quote.
[02:54:35.780 --> 02:54:44.780]  He says, leave good people out of the range of the shooting and go after criminals full steam.
[02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:48.780]  These kinds of people, criminals, you cannot treat them as if they were normal human beings.
[02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:52.780]  Okay, we can't let policemen keep dying at the hands of those guys.
[02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:54.780]  And this is, this is where they're really going to get them.
[02:54:54.780 --> 02:55:00.780]  If he kills, talking about a police officer or military member, 10, 15 or 20 with 10 or 30 bullets each,
[02:55:00.780 --> 02:55:04.780]  he needs to get a medal and not be prosecuted.
[02:55:04.780 --> 02:55:07.780]  You know who that reminds me of is Duterte, actually.
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:09.780]  That is a Duterte type of comment.
[02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:14.780]  It is, it's like, you know, execute the drug dealers and we'll give you a bounty.
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:20.780]  And regardless of what you think about him and his policies, I got to tell you,
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:24.780]  the drug dealing problem did quickly hit you there.
[02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:26.780]  Oh yeah, you start killing drug dealers.
[02:55:26.780 --> 02:55:31.780]  Yeah, but then the problem is you have these government funded assassins who are judge and jury,
[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:34.780]  you know, they get to decide who lives and who dies.
[02:55:34.780 --> 02:55:39.780]  Well, I'm not going to pretend to know the complexities of what's going on with Duterte and the Philippines,
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:42.780]  but Brazil, I'm a little closer, I've been to Brazil, I have friends in Brazil.
[02:55:42.780 --> 02:55:47.780]  And I'm, and see people in America specifically on the left will see this and be like,
[02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:50.780]  oh my gosh, Bolsonaro wants police brutality.
[02:55:50.780 --> 02:55:51.780]  He's a brute.
[02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:52.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:56.780]  No, no, no, the people in Brazil are sick of what's going on in the fellas.
[02:55:56.780 --> 02:55:58.780]  They're sick of the gang activity.
[02:55:58.780 --> 02:56:00.780]  They're sick of the people dealing drugs.
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:04.780]  And so someone on the outside looking in that has no clue of the situation is going to say,
[02:56:04.780 --> 02:56:06.780]  oh my gosh, this Bolsonaro, he's too extreme.
[02:56:06.780 --> 02:56:09.780]  No, and you know what, maybe the rhetoric is extreme and people don't like it,
[02:56:09.780 --> 02:56:12.780]  but people in Brazil are sick of what's going on.
[02:56:12.780 --> 02:56:15.780]  You can't even go into these areas of town anymore.
[02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:17.780]  It's like people in Mexico, same situation.
[02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:23.780]  You know, the Mexican gangs are in control of almost everything, including the Mexican government.
[02:56:23.780 --> 02:56:24.780]  Let's be honest.
[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:25.780]  Oh yeah.
[02:56:25.780 --> 02:56:27.780]  Well, you got to clean that up at some point.
[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:30.780]  How do you do it when the entire justice system is corrupt?
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:33.780]  And they're putting out $100,000 hits on Breitbart reporters.
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:34.780]  Yep.
[02:56:34.780 --> 02:56:42.780]  You know, to address when crime is so bad, sometimes you have to have a temporary period of clean this up.
[02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:46.780]  And you got to give police powers, even if it's temporary, I think.
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:50.780]  You know what I think needs to happen too, as you're about to take over here with Stuart Rhodes?
[02:56:50.780 --> 02:56:55.780]  What I'd like to see is a new summit, and maybe Trump should spearhead this,
[02:56:55.780 --> 02:56:57.780]  a new global leader summit.
[02:56:57.780 --> 02:57:00.780]  However, it's only for the nationalistic candidates.
[02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:01.780]  You don't invite the Merkels.
[02:57:01.780 --> 02:57:03.780]  You don't invite the Macrons.
[02:57:03.780 --> 02:57:05.780]  You invite the Severinis from Italy.
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:07.780]  You invite the Bolsonaro should he win from Brazil.
[02:57:07.780 --> 02:57:08.780]  You have Trump leading it.
[02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:12.780]  So, even Duterte, maybe you don't like everything he does, but he's nationalist.
[02:57:12.780 --> 02:57:14.780]  It's time, because what do we have?
[02:57:14.780 --> 02:57:16.780]  We have all of these globalist summits, right?
[02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:17.780]  Right.
[02:57:17.780 --> 02:57:22.780]  Every summit, every international combine, everything is all about globalism and centralization.
[02:57:22.780 --> 02:57:24.780]  We need to have a nationalist combine.
[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:27.780]  We need to have a pro-sovereignty combine summit.
[02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:28.780]  That's what has to...
[02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:33.780]  Putin, Trump, Bolsonaro, Severini, that's who needs to spearhead this.
[02:57:33.780 --> 02:57:34.780]  And it could be coming in the future.
[02:57:34.780 --> 02:57:35.780]  All right.
[02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:38.780]  Mike Adams takes over the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show with Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers.
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:39.780]  I sign off.
[02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:41.780]  You stay classy, Info Warriors.
[02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:47.780]  Info Wars Life is launching its newest product.

[02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:33.780]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:58:33.780 --> 02:58:35.780]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[02:58:35.780 --> 02:58:38.780]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[02:58:38.780 --> 02:58:41.780]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:48.780]  Get yours today, infowarslife.com.
[02:59:11.780 --> 02:59:15.780]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:15.780 --> 02:59:20.780]  that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email
[02:59:20.780 --> 02:59:27.780]  so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:27.780 --> 02:59:32.780]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[02:59:32.780 --> 02:59:35.780]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[02:59:35.780 --> 02:59:42.780]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:42.780 --> 03:00:09.780]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:00:09.780 --> 03:00:15.780]  Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status quo.
[03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:18.780]  You have about 800 million followers.
[03:00:18.780 --> 03:00:19.780]  That's why you're banned.
[03:00:19.780 --> 03:00:22.780]  Social media censorship.
[03:00:22.780 --> 03:00:27.780]  Virtually every day the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:34.780]  Facebook censors our free speech and shame all the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[03:00:34.780 --> 03:00:39.780]  For many on the left, the views seem to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:42.780]  They broke their algorithm to try to steal the selection.
[03:00:42.780 --> 03:00:45.780]  And now they're down to the last corners of the internet.
[03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:49.780]  Oh no, conservatives can speak to one another. We must shut it off.
[03:00:49.780 --> 03:00:56.780]  People know what's true. They can smell it. You can't stop them from knowing that.
[03:00:56.780 --> 03:00:59.780]  And we're back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:06.780]  Thanks for joining me today. This is Mike Adams and I'm going to be joined in an upcoming segment by Stuart Rhodes from Oathkeepers.
[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:09.780]  He's here live in studio in person.
[03:01:09.780 --> 03:01:15.780]  It's actually the first time that I've ever met him in person, which is interesting because I've known about his work for many, many years.
[03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:23.780]  But this is going to be a crucial segment to tune into because I'll be asking Stuart about the Spartan group,
[03:01:23.780 --> 03:01:30.780]  which is being trained now to defend people against the violence of Antifa,
[03:01:30.780 --> 03:01:35.780]  which is of course a domestic terrorism group that uses masked faces.
[03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:41.780]  They mask themselves so they can carry out violent crimes with apparent impunity.
[03:01:41.780 --> 03:01:45.780]  And they commit felony assault on a regular basis.
[03:01:45.780 --> 03:01:50.780]  They bash people over the heads with bike locks and many of them, they display weapons
[03:01:50.780 --> 03:01:56.780]  and they openly talk about using those weapons to shoot patriots and to shoot Trump supporters.
[03:01:56.780 --> 03:02:02.780]  And at some point, you have to defend yourself against that kind of violence.
[03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:09.780]  And so Stuart Rhodes group, the Spartans or Spartans with Oathkeepers is part of that national defense,
[03:02:09.780 --> 03:02:12.780]  taking a defensive posture, not an aggressive posture.
[03:02:12.780 --> 03:02:16.780]  It's not about instigating violence. It's about halting violence,
[03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:22.780]  which is the correct posture that all of us follow who are concealed firearms carriers like myself
[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:27.780]  and all the training that I've gone through with firearms, pistol, rifle training,
[03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:35.780]  battle training or self-defense training, all the training that I've gone through with former and current military.
[03:02:35.780 --> 03:02:43.780]  Because I know a lot of people in the military and they have brought me up to speed on a lot of important defensive tactics.
[03:02:43.780 --> 03:02:46.780]  The number one posture is defensive.
[03:02:46.780 --> 03:02:53.780]  You don't instigate violence, but you are able to and willing to defend yourself against violent attacks.
[03:02:53.780 --> 03:03:02.780]  And if necessary, you may one day be called to defend your nation against an attempted takeover or an enemy invasion
[03:03:02.780 --> 03:03:10.780]  or a communist coup attempt carried out by people who hate your country and who are trying to destroy it.
[03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:17.780]  So these are very real and very serious issues to discuss, but we always discuss them from the point of view of a defensive posture.
[03:03:17.780 --> 03:03:24.780]  So all these accusations that patriots are violent people or trying to commit violence, it's nonsense.
[03:03:24.780 --> 03:03:31.780]  There might be a few outliers on the fringes on both sides of the political spectrum who are unhinged.
[03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:36.780]  The mass shooters out there mostly comes down to mental illness or psychiatric drugs.
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:44.780]  But most nearly all patriots and conservatives and Trump supporters, even when they carry firearms, they do so with a defensive posture.
[03:03:44.780 --> 03:03:50.780]  Knowing that it is not only our right, but even our duty to help protect our communities.
[03:03:50.780 --> 03:03:57.780]  If necessary to help protect our men and women in blue who deserve our protection, many times they're vastly outnumbered.
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:04:05.780]  And if there is an outbreak of violence, as I think will happen very soon, probably between the end of the election and the new year,
[03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:15.780]  we will probably be in a situation where we need to offer assistance to law enforcement that are trying to keep law and order in our societies
[03:04:15.780 --> 03:04:23.780]  to prevent society from breaking down into total chaos where rampant violence and arson and destruction of businesses
[03:04:23.780 --> 03:04:29.780]  and destruction of property is being carried out by radical hate-filled leftists who literally want to destroy this country
[03:04:29.780 --> 03:04:31.780]  and kill as many people as possible in the process.
[03:04:31.780 --> 03:04:37.780]  So we're going to talk Stuart Rhodes here, we're going to talk about that posture, we're going to talk about defending our nation

[03:06:15.780 --> 03:06:16.780]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:06:16.780 --> 03:06:23.780]  This is Mike Adams joined in studio today by Stuart Rhodes of Oathkeepers and Stuart has joined us.
[03:06:23.780 --> 03:06:27.780]  Where are you actually based? What city are you normally residing in?
[03:06:27.780 --> 03:06:28.780]  I'm in Kalispell, Montana.
[03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:31.780]  Okay, Montana. Well, you've come a long way to be in studio here.
[03:06:31.780 --> 03:06:33.780]  Go ahead and lean into the microphone a little bit more if you could.
[03:06:33.780 --> 03:06:34.780]  You bet.
[03:06:34.780 --> 03:06:35.780]  So welcome.
[03:06:35.780 --> 03:06:36.780]  Thanks.
[03:06:36.780 --> 03:06:37.780]  It's great to have you here in studio.
[03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:38.780]  It was a pleasure.
[03:06:38.780 --> 03:06:41.780]  Just give us a little background of Oathkeepers.
[03:06:41.780 --> 03:06:46.780]  I'm sure most people are very familiar with your work, but just in case a few aren't.
[03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:48.780]  Go ahead and tell us a little bit about Oathkeepers.
[03:06:48.780 --> 03:06:53.780]  Well, we started up in 2009 and the prime motivator for me was two things.
[03:06:53.780 --> 03:06:55.780]  One was Katrina.
[03:06:55.780 --> 03:06:57.780]  We saw what happened in Katrina.
[03:06:57.780 --> 03:07:02.780]  We had cops obeyed unconstitutional orders to disarm people who were just trying to protect themselves.
[03:07:02.780 --> 03:07:09.780]  And also the growth of executive power, in particular, the claimed power of the president to detain any American as an enemy combatant.
[03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:15.780]  Now as a student at Yale Law School, I focused on that and it was quite, you know, crossing the Rubicon and that claimed authority.
[03:07:15.780 --> 03:07:17.780]  So one of the focus on the men with the guns.
[03:07:17.780 --> 03:07:20.780]  And since then, we've grown nationwide.
[03:07:20.780 --> 03:07:24.780]  We were known for being on the rooftops in Ferguson, guarding against arsonists.
[03:07:24.780 --> 03:07:27.780]  We're known for being at Bundy Ranch.
[03:07:27.780 --> 03:07:34.780]  Most recently, this last year, we stood up against antifollow of the country and protected people against their violence in the streets.
[03:07:34.780 --> 03:07:38.780]  Now the members of Oathkeepers, my understanding is many of them are current or former law enforcement.
[03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:39.780]  Absolutely.
[03:07:39.780 --> 03:07:40.780]  Military.
[03:07:40.780 --> 03:07:41.780]  Right.
[03:07:41.780 --> 03:07:45.780]  So military police and first responders, firefighters, mentees, search and rescue.
[03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:52.780]  And the main point is, is to go to the tip of the spear, the ones who would be used against the American people, but also the ones that have the skills to defend the American people.
[03:07:52.780 --> 03:07:56.780]  And whether they're current serving or retired, like I'm a former, I was a paratrooper in the Army.
[03:07:56.780 --> 03:07:58.780]  So a lot of our guys are veterans.
[03:07:58.780 --> 03:08:05.780]  So is it fair to say that the oath part of Oathkeepers is about keeping our oath, the oath that we took to defend this nation?
[03:08:05.780 --> 03:08:06.780]  Absolutely.
[03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:09.780]  There's no new oath. It's just simply the oath we took when we were in service.
[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:13.780]  And it's the obligation to support and defend the Constitution, which comes from the Constitution itself.
[03:08:13.780 --> 03:08:15.780]  You know, the founders put that in there for a reason.
[03:08:15.780 --> 03:08:25.780]  So what about in situations like you mentioned in Katrina where local law enforcement were violating the Constitution, they were going door to door and demanding people's lawfully owned firearms?
[03:08:25.780 --> 03:08:27.780]  Well, it was just locals. It was kind of a problem.
[03:08:27.780 --> 03:08:33.780]  You had cops who were federalized and brought in from all over the country disobeying or obeying unconstitutional orders.
[03:08:33.780 --> 03:08:38.780]  And part was out of ignorance and conditioning to disobey orders, but we know that's no excuse.
[03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:42.780]  Right. So what would Oathkeepers want to see in that situation?
[03:08:42.780 --> 03:08:44.780]  A stand down, absolute refusal.
[03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:51.780]  And we had one entire unit from the National Guard of Utah that did refuse to participate in some good model example of what can be done in Katrina.
[03:08:51.780 --> 03:08:54.780]  So some guys are the right thing, but most of them did not.
[03:08:54.780 --> 03:09:00.780]  So is that because the mindset, the training in law enforcement and military is often just follow orders?
[03:09:00.780 --> 03:09:04.780]  But you're actually supposed to interpret. You're supposed to think for yourself as well.
[03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:05.780]  Right, exactly.
[03:09:05.780 --> 03:09:08.780]  I mean, you're a human. We're not robots yet.
[03:09:08.780 --> 03:09:09.780]  Well, we're supposed to.
[03:09:09.780 --> 03:09:10.780]  Cyborgs.
[03:09:10.780 --> 03:09:14.780]  That's why the Oath is the requirement to defend the Constitution and the Constitution itself.
[03:09:14.780 --> 03:09:18.780]  And in the military, like I was in the military, you're taught, they teach about my line.
[03:09:18.780 --> 03:09:24.780]  They teach you about where the lines are and the laws of war, but they don't teach enough about what to do here domestically.
[03:09:24.780 --> 03:09:28.780]  And with law enforcement, unfortunately, there's this mindset among political class as well.
[03:09:28.780 --> 03:09:33.780]  Well, hey, if there's an emergency, we can go ahead and do it for sure.
[03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:36.780]  And I was even on Bill O'Reilly's show not too long after that.
[03:09:36.780 --> 03:09:38.780]  And he was, and he's like, well, that was an emergency.
[03:09:38.780 --> 03:09:39.780]  I said, well, so what?
[03:09:39.780 --> 03:09:41.780]  You know, bad weather does not suspend the Constitution.
[03:09:41.780 --> 03:09:43.780]  That's when you need your firearms during an emergency.
[03:09:43.780 --> 03:09:48.780]  Well, especially when looters are going door to door, you know, stealing from people.
[03:09:48.780 --> 03:09:49.780]  Right.
[03:09:49.780 --> 03:09:51.780]  I'm not giving up my firearm in that kind of scenario.
[03:09:51.780 --> 03:09:58.780]  And you have a breakdown in law enforcement. And this is what's kind of perverse, is the found expect that all of us to be the militia, right?
[03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:00.780]  And nowadays, of course, that's frowned upon.
[03:10:00.780 --> 03:10:06.780]  And so the idea is that this warrior class of professionals protects us and we're not allowed to pick ourselves.
[03:10:06.780 --> 03:10:08.780]  Yeah, you're exactly right.
[03:10:08.780 --> 03:10:15.780]  And that's what liberals want for America is that you as an individual have no right, they believe, to defend yourself.
[03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:20.780]  And that you have to delegate that right to a special class of people who are controlled by the government.
[03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:23.780]  And can easily abuse their power.
[03:10:23.780 --> 03:10:33.780]  But the decentralization of that power is when every citizen has a legal firearm and can defend themselves or can take part in the defense of their community.
[03:10:33.780 --> 03:10:34.780]  Absolutely.
[03:10:34.780 --> 03:10:36.780]  And that's what, I mean, America has been that way since its founding.
[03:10:36.780 --> 03:10:38.780]  Well, that was the entire design of the founders.
[03:10:38.780 --> 03:10:47.780]  They intended that the military power be in the hands of the people, that we are, you know, they're the one and the same, not the separation between the warrior class and then the working class.
[03:10:47.780 --> 03:10:48.780]  Right.
[03:10:48.780 --> 03:10:52.780]  Like in Plato's Republic, we have the bronze and the silver and the gold.
[03:10:52.780 --> 03:10:58.780]  So their ideal was, as that's what they say in the Second Amendment, it's necessary for the security of free stay.
[03:10:58.780 --> 03:11:00.780]  You're not secure, you're not free without it.
[03:11:00.780 --> 03:11:02.780]  You have to have the dispersion of power, like you said.
[03:11:02.780 --> 03:11:04.780]  It's also the only way it's going to be effective.
[03:11:04.780 --> 03:11:09.780]  In Katrina, you had cops being brought from all over the country and there's still one enough cops to secure people against the leaders.
[03:11:09.780 --> 03:11:11.780]  Good point. That's right. That's right.
[03:11:11.780 --> 03:11:16.780]  A decentralized system of self-defense and protection is a very strong and resilient system.
[03:11:16.780 --> 03:11:18.780]  And that's okay.
[03:11:18.780 --> 03:11:25.780]  Now, for those watching on infowars.com, I want to ask you about your parents.
[03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:26.780]  You're wearing an eyepatch.
[03:11:26.780 --> 03:11:29.780]  People on the radio can't necessarily see that, obviously.
[03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:33.780]  But I want to ask you, that's not just for show, right?
[03:11:33.780 --> 03:11:40.780]  I've got an old, I lost my eye in an accident many years ago and it's just recently ruptured again, my prosthetic.
[03:11:40.780 --> 03:11:41.780]  And I think we got to rebuild.
[03:11:41.780 --> 03:11:43.780]  So until that happens, I'm a pirate.
[03:11:43.780 --> 03:11:44.780]  Okay.
[03:11:44.780 --> 03:11:45.780]  I get to play a pirate.
[03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:48.780]  I just want people to understand that there's a medical reason for your eye.
[03:11:48.780 --> 03:11:49.780]  Oh yeah, absolutely. That's right.
[03:11:49.780 --> 03:11:50.780]  Right. Okay.
[03:11:50.780 --> 03:11:51.780]  Yeah.
[03:11:51.780 --> 03:11:52.780]  I'm not trying to play Nick Fury.
[03:11:52.780 --> 03:11:53.780]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
[03:11:53.780 --> 03:11:54.780]  Right.
[03:11:54.780 --> 03:11:56.780]  The website for Oathkeepers.
[03:11:56.780 --> 03:11:57.780]  Oathkeepers.org.
[03:11:57.780 --> 03:11:58.780] .org.
[03:11:58.780 --> 03:11:59.780]  Right.
[03:11:59.780 --> 03:12:00.780]  Okay.
[03:12:00.780 --> 03:12:05.780]  And I want to ask you about the Spartan group, the Spartan training that Oathkeepers is now pursuing.
[03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:06.780]  Yes.
[03:12:06.780 --> 03:12:14.780]  As I read, as I understood from your announcements, this was a group to help defend innocent people from the violence being initiated by Antifa in particular.
[03:12:14.780 --> 03:12:15.780]  Is that correct?
[03:12:15.780 --> 03:12:16.780]  That's right.
[03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:23.780]  And also to be there as a pool to be used by a sheriff for the Posse to be volunteers to protect our schools.
[03:12:23.780 --> 03:12:35.780]  And based upon the very successful tier running program that Sheriff Judd has in Polk County, Florida, where he uses local military veterans and police veterans along with volunteers in the school system itself and parents.
[03:12:35.780 --> 03:12:38.780]  He trains them all as standard and they guard, protect the schools.
[03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:49.780]  So we want to see that replicated across the country so we want to get motivating people to train and organize so they're available to be the Posse for their sheriff or to be the militia of their state if called up by their governor.
[03:12:49.780 --> 03:12:54.780]  So the sheriff could just turn to this group that are all part of your organization, Spartan training.
[03:12:54.780 --> 03:13:02.780]  The sheriff could say in an emergency they could deputize this entire group if there were real chaos going on and people needed extra protection.
[03:13:02.780 --> 03:13:04.780]  Is that possible?
[03:13:04.780 --> 03:13:09.780]  Well, similarly, what we want to do, the goal is not to have a group of oath keepers.
[03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:12.780]  It's to have the people of the county trained and organized.
[03:13:12.780 --> 03:13:14.780]  So whether they join oath keepers or not, I don't really care.
[03:13:14.780 --> 03:13:15.780]  Right.
[03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:16.780]  I just want to see them trained.
[03:13:16.780 --> 03:13:18.780]  So these training groups are open to anybody in any group.
[03:13:18.780 --> 03:13:20.780]  Oh, so it's kind of like Appleseed training.
[03:13:20.780 --> 03:13:21.780]  Exactly.
[03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:22.780]  Oh, okay.
[03:13:22.780 --> 03:13:23.780]  There you go.
[03:13:23.780 --> 03:13:24.780]  Very much like Appleseed.
[03:13:24.780 --> 03:13:25.780]  Got it.
[03:13:25.780 --> 03:13:26.780]  But we want to see them organized.
[03:13:26.780 --> 03:13:28.780]  We want to see them organized down to the county level so that they're available.
[03:13:28.780 --> 03:13:29.780]  They know each other.
[03:13:29.780 --> 03:13:30.780]  They're used to training together.
[03:13:30.780 --> 03:13:33.780]  They've worked out all the bugs and they know how to work together as a team.
[03:13:33.780 --> 03:13:34.780]  Okay.
[03:13:34.780 --> 03:13:36.780]  And they can be turned into the posse like that.
[03:13:36.780 --> 03:13:37.780]  Oh, wow.
[03:13:37.780 --> 03:13:38.780]  Okay.
[03:13:38.780 --> 03:13:42.780]  So how does someone join this training?
[03:13:42.780 --> 03:13:48.780]  You go to our website and there's a post on our front page about the Spartan training groups.
[03:13:48.780 --> 03:13:49.780]  They can go on there.
[03:13:49.780 --> 03:13:50.780]  We'll have to apply.
[03:13:50.780 --> 03:13:51.780]  We will vet them.
[03:13:51.780 --> 03:13:55.780]  We don't want communists or anarchists or white nationalists, people who are domestic
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:13:56.780]  in the Constitution.
[03:13:56.780 --> 03:13:57.780]  We don't want them coming back.
[03:13:57.780 --> 03:13:59.780]  So there's a background check.
[03:13:59.780 --> 03:14:01.780]  Does that include social media?
[03:14:01.780 --> 03:14:02.780]  Absolutely.
[03:14:02.780 --> 03:14:03.780]  Exactly.
[03:14:03.780 --> 03:14:04.780]  Yeah.
[03:14:04.780 --> 03:14:05.780]  Okay.
[03:14:05.780 --> 03:14:06.780]  What about a criminal history?
[03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:10.780]  If they can give us their CCW, for example, that'd be a good shortcut to that.
[03:14:10.780 --> 03:14:12.780]  I mean, here's the bottom line.
[03:14:12.780 --> 03:14:13.780]  We can't train felons.
[03:14:13.780 --> 03:14:18.780]  I know some people are felons because of unjust unconstitutional laws, but we have a, you
[03:14:18.780 --> 03:14:22.780]  know, our military and veterans can't, our military guys and police officers can't train
[03:14:22.780 --> 03:14:23.780]  felons.
[03:14:23.780 --> 03:14:25.780]  So we do not want to train people who are enemies of the Constitution.
[03:14:25.780 --> 03:14:26.780]  Yes.
[03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:27.780]  So it must be some vetting.
[03:14:27.780 --> 03:14:28.780]  Okay.
[03:14:28.780 --> 03:14:33.780]  So once they get accepted into the program, then they would join some local training group.
[03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:34.780]  Right.
[03:14:34.780 --> 03:14:36.780]  And what, what does this training entail?
[03:14:36.780 --> 03:14:39.780]  Well, we want to train them for, for three main points.
[03:14:39.780 --> 03:14:42.780]  One is to, is to be able to protect the schools.
[03:14:42.780 --> 03:14:45.780]  Second is to be able to protect public events against leftist violence.
[03:14:45.780 --> 03:14:50.780]  And a third is to be available as the militia to deploy on the border and secure our border.
[03:14:50.780 --> 03:14:51.780]  Wow.
[03:14:51.780 --> 03:14:53.780]  We see two, two existential threats right now.
[03:14:53.780 --> 03:14:54.780]  The border is one of them.
[03:14:54.780 --> 03:14:58.780]  If we don't seal the border, we're going to have, you know, the Democrat plan is to bring
[03:14:58.780 --> 03:15:01.780]  in more people from the third world and they hope they'll vote Democrat.
[03:15:01.780 --> 03:15:02.780]  Absolutely.
[03:15:02.780 --> 03:15:03.780]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:15:03.780 --> 03:15:04.780]  And it's, and it's illegitimate, obviously.
[03:15:04.780 --> 03:15:05.780]  That's very subversive.
[03:15:05.780 --> 03:15:07.780]  That's the big, one big existential threat.
[03:15:07.780 --> 03:15:09.780]  The second one is the schools.
[03:15:09.780 --> 03:15:15.780]  They want to see more dead kids so that eventually, like in Australia or in England or in Scotland,
[03:15:15.780 --> 03:15:16.780]  they can eventually disarm us.
[03:15:16.780 --> 03:15:17.780]  Yeah.
[03:15:17.780 --> 03:15:18.780]  We don't fix that.
[03:15:18.780 --> 03:15:19.780]  We're in trouble.
[03:15:19.780 --> 03:15:20.780]  Okay.
[03:15:20.780 --> 03:15:23.780]  So we're going to go to break here shortly, but when we come back, I want to ask you more
[03:15:23.780 --> 03:15:24.780]  about the border.
[03:15:24.780 --> 03:15:31.460]  I have questions about, you know, authority and the border patrol or maybe a future government
[03:15:31.460 --> 03:15:33.280]  that doesn't want the border protected.
[03:15:33.280 --> 03:15:34.780]  How do you work out that kind of clash?
[03:15:34.780 --> 03:15:40.020]  I want to ask you about protecting schools when obviously the Democrats want schools
[03:15:40.020 --> 03:15:42.300]  to be gun-free zones, almost like magnets for shooting.
[03:15:42.300 --> 03:15:43.300]  Right.
[03:15:43.300 --> 03:15:46.700]  So how do we effectively protect children against nut jobs out there?
[03:15:46.700 --> 03:15:50.500]  But we'll be back with that and much more, you're watching the Alex Jones Show, Stuart

[03:16:54.460 --> 03:16:58.380]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.380 --> 03:16:59.940]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:16:59.940 --> 03:17:02.900]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.900 --> 03:17:06.180]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[03:20:09.220 --> 03:20:10.220]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.220 --> 03:20:29.580]  All right, we're continuing with Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes here in studio.
[03:20:29.580 --> 03:20:33.580]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the fourth hour today on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:33.580 --> 03:20:37.860]  Thank you for sticking with us in many different levels, by the way.
[03:20:37.860 --> 03:20:40.820]  So Stuart has been describing this new program.
[03:20:40.820 --> 03:20:41.820]  It's called Spartan.
[03:20:41.820 --> 03:20:46.740]  It's a training program inside Oath Keepers where citizens can be trained to help assist
[03:20:46.740 --> 03:20:50.420]  law enforcement or assist in the defense of their communities or perhaps even their own
[03:20:50.420 --> 03:20:51.420]  nation.
[03:20:51.420 --> 03:20:55.020]  I wanted to ask you about the border security situation.
[03:20:55.020 --> 03:21:03.140]  You said specifically that Spartan trainees or members may be called upon to help secure
[03:21:03.140 --> 03:21:05.220]  our nation's border.
[03:21:05.220 --> 03:21:06.220]  How do you plan to do that?
[03:21:06.220 --> 03:21:10.180]  Well, the first thing that should happen, of course, is Trump should have ordered the
[03:21:10.180 --> 03:21:14.140]  military out of the border as his first act as president, so he should have done as commander
[03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:15.140]  in chief.
[03:21:15.140 --> 03:21:16.140]  Yeah.
[03:21:16.140 --> 03:21:19.780]  But he also can call upon the militia, which is all of us, and call us in the federal service
[03:21:19.780 --> 03:21:20.780]  on his own.
[03:21:20.780 --> 03:21:22.740]  So he doesn't need congressional approval today?
[03:21:22.740 --> 03:21:23.740]  He does not.
[03:21:23.740 --> 03:21:24.740]  He already has it.
[03:21:24.740 --> 03:21:25.740]  Any of that.
[03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:26.740]  Yeah.
[03:21:26.740 --> 03:21:28.300]  Congress has already provided for calling for the militia, and he has the authority
[03:21:28.300 --> 03:21:29.300]  to do it.
[03:21:29.300 --> 03:21:32.220]  It's like he has the authority to deploy DOD assets right now.
[03:21:32.220 --> 03:21:36.460]  And deploying the military on the border does not violate Posse-Cometatus because it's securing
[03:21:36.460 --> 03:21:38.940]  the border, which is mentioned in the Constitution.
[03:21:38.940 --> 03:21:39.940]  That's right.
[03:21:39.940 --> 03:21:43.380]  Or if you're concerned about that, you could have the Border Patrol actually enforce the
[03:21:43.380 --> 03:21:48.140]  laws due to detention and processing, but you can have the military protect them.
[03:21:48.140 --> 03:21:53.620]  Like, for example, you had this Border Patrol agent shot about two months ago in Arizona.
[03:21:53.620 --> 03:21:57.260]  He ran into a RIP crew with a shot with AK-47, only survived because he had a party armor
[03:21:57.260 --> 03:22:01.300]  on, had a plate armor on, but it would have been nice to have a squad of Marines or squad
[03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:04.980]  of Army infantry escorting him, protecting him while he enforce the laws.
[03:22:04.980 --> 03:22:05.980]  Yes.
[03:22:05.980 --> 03:22:09.380]  But of course, coming out of eight years of Obama, we had a president who did not want
[03:22:09.380 --> 03:22:10.780]  any enforcement on the border.
[03:22:10.780 --> 03:22:11.780]  Right.
[03:22:11.780 --> 03:22:15.900]  Obviously, it's the Democrats' voter recruitment plan to have as many people just walk across
[03:22:15.900 --> 03:22:19.220]  the border and then get licensed to vote in California.
[03:22:19.220 --> 03:22:20.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:22:20.220 --> 03:22:21.220]  But now we have Trump.
[03:22:21.220 --> 03:22:24.140]  Why is Trump not doing what needs to be done?
[03:22:24.140 --> 03:22:26.820]  So not challenge him to do his job, frankly.
[03:22:26.820 --> 03:22:27.820]  Yeah.
[03:22:27.820 --> 03:22:30.900]  I don't know the answer to that either, but there's a lot, there's a lot that we wish
[03:22:30.900 --> 03:22:31.900]  him to do.
[03:22:31.900 --> 03:22:32.900]  Too many swamps?
[03:22:32.900 --> 03:22:33.900]  Too many swamps?
[03:22:33.900 --> 03:22:34.900]  Yeah.
[03:22:34.900 --> 03:22:35.900]  I mean, look, he's doing a lot.
[03:22:35.900 --> 03:22:38.700]  Can you imagine being in his shoes right now and you're attacked and vilified and lied
[03:22:38.700 --> 03:22:39.700]  about every day?
[03:22:39.700 --> 03:22:40.700]  Right.
[03:22:40.700 --> 03:22:44.940]  Half the people that you could even try to hire are swamp creatures who are just beholden
[03:22:44.940 --> 03:22:46.180]  to the swamp.
[03:22:46.180 --> 03:22:50.980]  How do you even extricate yourself from that situation and save the country at the same
[03:22:50.980 --> 03:22:56.140]  time and exit the White House one day with your business still intact in his case?
[03:22:56.140 --> 03:22:59.220]  I think he has to look at his own oath.
[03:22:59.220 --> 03:23:04.060]  We voted him into office to take care of business and do what's right, and all he really has
[03:23:04.060 --> 03:23:07.740]  to do is call him General Mattis and get it done so he can do it.
[03:23:07.740 --> 03:23:10.940]  And they're going to demonize and attack no matter what he does, he might not do the
[03:23:10.940 --> 03:23:11.940]  right thing.
[03:23:11.940 --> 03:23:12.940]  That's true.
[03:23:12.940 --> 03:23:13.940]  What about the wall?
[03:23:13.940 --> 03:23:19.620]  I mean, building the wall, whether it's entirely physical or if it's drone enhanced
[03:23:19.620 --> 03:23:24.020]  or what have you, do you think the wall will be effective if we don't have enough people
[03:23:24.020 --> 03:23:25.020]  there?
[03:23:25.020 --> 03:23:26.020]  No.
[03:23:26.020 --> 03:23:31.940]  That was an infantry in the Army, no barrier of any design is effective unless it's under
[03:23:31.940 --> 03:23:34.180]  observation and enforcement.
[03:23:34.180 --> 03:23:37.980]  You have to be able to observe, and then you have to be able to go and stop the breaches.
[03:23:37.980 --> 03:23:39.180]  So you must have monitoring.
[03:23:39.180 --> 03:23:42.900]  You can use sensors, you can use drones as force multipliers, but you still need boots
[03:23:42.900 --> 03:23:44.700]  on the ground.
[03:23:44.700 --> 03:23:49.740]  That's why you have to have us as the militia, National Guard, and the military on the border.
[03:23:49.740 --> 03:23:54.460]  So in your view, the ideal thing would be for the President to simply declare as the
[03:23:54.460 --> 03:23:59.300]  head of the executive branch to declare what, citizens defend the border?
[03:23:59.300 --> 03:24:00.300]  I mean, what?
[03:24:00.300 --> 03:24:01.300]  To call it a militia.
[03:24:01.300 --> 03:24:06.220]  You would say, I'm calling for the militia to repel an invasion.
[03:24:06.220 --> 03:24:08.900]  How do you have rules of engagement and all of that?
[03:24:08.900 --> 03:24:10.980]  What if people go down to the border and just start shooting?
[03:24:10.980 --> 03:24:15.420]  No, they come to the authority, he brings them to the authority of the U.S. military.
[03:24:15.420 --> 03:24:16.420]  I see.
[03:24:16.420 --> 03:24:19.980]  And the first wave could be us with military prior training and law enforcement training.
[03:24:19.980 --> 03:24:20.980]  I see.
[03:24:20.980 --> 03:24:24.780]  The first wave are men who already are trained, and then they turn around and train the rest
[03:24:24.780 --> 03:24:25.780]  of them.
[03:24:25.780 --> 03:24:26.780]  That's what you should be doing.
[03:24:26.780 --> 03:24:27.780]  You said men.
[03:24:27.780 --> 03:24:28.780]  What about women?
[03:24:28.780 --> 03:24:29.780]  Are there women in your organization?
[03:24:29.780 --> 03:24:30.780]  Of course.
[03:24:30.780 --> 03:24:31.780]  What about transgenders?
[03:24:31.780 --> 03:24:32.780]  Do you have transgenders?
[03:24:32.780 --> 03:24:33.780]  I don't think so.
[03:24:33.780 --> 03:24:34.780]  Spartans?
[03:24:34.780 --> 03:24:35.780]  Probably not.
[03:24:35.780 --> 03:24:36.780]  I had to ask.
[03:24:36.780 --> 03:24:37.780]  Stuart, I had to ask.
[03:24:37.780 --> 03:24:38.780]  You know what?
[03:24:38.780 --> 03:24:39.780]  I really don't care.
[03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:43.100]  As long as they're willing to go down and protect the Constitution and protect the border,
[03:24:43.100 --> 03:24:44.100]  go for it.
[03:24:44.100 --> 03:24:45.100]  See, I feel the same way.
[03:24:45.100 --> 03:24:46.100]  I'll leave that up to DOD though.
[03:24:46.100 --> 03:24:47.780]  I don't care what your private life is like.
[03:24:47.780 --> 03:24:54.260]  If you defend this republic, if you defend the Constitution, you're on my team.
[03:24:54.260 --> 03:24:55.260]  You know what I mean?
[03:24:55.260 --> 03:24:56.260]  Right.
[03:24:56.260 --> 03:24:57.260]  That's kind of the way I feel about it.
[03:24:57.260 --> 03:24:58.260]  But I had to ask.
[03:24:58.260 --> 03:25:00.060]  But I think cross-dressers is pretty bad for unicohesion, frankly.
[03:25:00.060 --> 03:25:02.580]  Well, I tend to agree with that.
[03:25:02.580 --> 03:25:03.580]  Yeah.
[03:25:03.580 --> 03:25:08.940]  Maybe that could be the California division of the border patrol right there.
[03:25:08.940 --> 03:25:11.500]  Maybe the governor of California would approve of them.
[03:25:11.500 --> 03:25:12.500]  Maybe.
[03:25:12.500 --> 03:25:13.500]  Maybe.
[03:25:13.500 --> 03:25:14.500]  Yeah, okay.
[03:25:14.500 --> 03:25:17.300]  I don't mean to make too much light of the situation, but I had to throw that out there.
[03:25:17.300 --> 03:25:19.620]  Getting back to a more serious tone.
[03:25:19.620 --> 03:25:25.100]  So do you think there are enough volunteers in America to defend the border through the
[03:25:25.100 --> 03:25:27.380]  mechanism that you're mentioning here?
[03:25:27.380 --> 03:25:28.380]  Sure.
[03:25:28.380 --> 03:25:29.380]  If they answer the call.
[03:25:29.380 --> 03:25:31.380]  But I think it takes two things.
[03:25:31.380 --> 03:25:34.860]  If the president wanted to do it, I think if he did, they would.
[03:25:34.860 --> 03:25:38.900]  I think you have enough veterans in this country who would feel really good about being able
[03:25:38.900 --> 03:25:42.420]  to do something rather than being sent away to a foreign war where they don't feel like
[03:25:42.420 --> 03:25:43.860]  they did much good at all.
[03:25:43.860 --> 03:25:44.860]  Look at Iraq.
[03:25:44.860 --> 03:25:45.860]  It's a disaster.
[03:25:45.860 --> 03:25:46.860]  Yeah.
[03:25:46.860 --> 03:25:49.980]  And they can sink their teeth into and feel good about because it's actually here at home
[03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:51.620]  doing something that's a protector country.
[03:25:51.620 --> 03:25:55.820]  Well, and also, I mean, we saw a huge outpouring of veterans and former military willing to
[03:25:55.820 --> 03:25:58.380]  protect and defend schools.
[03:25:58.380 --> 03:26:02.260]  After every school shooting, there's all these people that say, hey, look, I'll volunteer.
[03:26:02.260 --> 03:26:03.260]  Yeah.
[03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:04.780]  I'll patrol the school for free.
[03:26:04.780 --> 03:26:05.780]  Right.
[03:26:05.780 --> 03:26:07.740]  So why aren't the school districts taking them up on that?
[03:26:07.740 --> 03:26:09.620]  Because they don't want them protected.
[03:26:09.620 --> 03:26:12.220]  This is what's kind of nice about Sheriff Judd's example.
[03:26:12.220 --> 03:26:16.500]  Sheriff Judd put a program in where he put them through his own post-academy, trained them
[03:26:16.500 --> 03:26:21.060]  to law enforcement standards or above, and he puts them in the school without asking permission
[03:26:21.060 --> 03:26:22.060]  of the school district.
[03:26:22.060 --> 03:26:25.540]  He does it under his authority as a sheriff, as law enforcement.
[03:26:25.540 --> 03:26:26.540]  Oh, interesting.
[03:26:26.540 --> 03:26:29.620]  They're basically like school resource officers, but they're volunteers.
[03:26:29.620 --> 03:26:33.260]  So he takes the teachers, the parents, or local military and police veterans.
[03:26:33.260 --> 03:26:38.020]  But so many parents who are anti-gun, they're indoctrinated and brainwashed, they're afraid
[03:26:38.020 --> 03:26:39.780]  of the object of a gun.
[03:26:39.780 --> 03:26:47.140]  So they're afraid of a trained, compassionate, even heroic security person having a gun on
[03:26:47.140 --> 03:26:50.860]  the premise when that person is the one who would defend their child.
[03:26:50.860 --> 03:26:51.860]  Right.
[03:26:51.860 --> 03:26:54.860]  But they're afraid of that person because the person has a gun, and they think guns
[03:26:54.860 --> 03:26:55.860]  kill people.
[03:26:55.860 --> 03:26:59.980]  Until the shooter shows up, and then they're on the phone calling 911 trying to get a cop
[03:26:59.980 --> 03:27:00.980]  there as fast as possible.
[03:27:00.980 --> 03:27:01.980]  Right.
[03:27:01.980 --> 03:27:04.540]  So they want the armed guy to show up when the shooting starts, but they don't want
[03:27:04.540 --> 03:27:06.020]  him there to stop in the first place.
[03:27:06.020 --> 03:27:12.180]  They want a 13-minute delay and a stand-down order from Broward County and hiding behind
[03:27:12.180 --> 03:27:14.140]  the sheriff's car, right?
[03:27:14.140 --> 03:27:15.140]  Right.
[03:27:15.140 --> 03:27:16.140]  Right.
[03:27:16.140 --> 03:27:19.340]  You don't train Spartan members to hide behind cars when the shootings are going on, do you?
[03:27:19.340 --> 03:27:20.340]  No, absolutely not.
[03:27:20.340 --> 03:27:23.140]  So they wouldn't qualify for Broward County duty?
[03:27:23.140 --> 03:27:24.140]  Probably not.
[03:27:24.140 --> 03:27:25.740]  Well, that goes back to the same problem.
[03:27:25.740 --> 03:27:29.820]  Evan Vera wrote a brilliant piece about this situation.
[03:27:29.820 --> 03:27:31.220]  He said the same thing about the border.
[03:27:31.220 --> 03:27:32.700]  He said the same thing about the schools.
[03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:37.420]  He said the president can call up the militia and put them in the schools to secure the
[03:27:37.420 --> 03:27:43.060]  schools, and it would trump, pardon the pun, but it would trump any school district or
[03:27:43.060 --> 03:27:44.060]  county opposition.
[03:27:44.060 --> 03:27:48.820]  This is a federal call-up, and you deploy the militia to protect the schools.
[03:27:48.820 --> 03:27:49.820]  Wow.
[03:27:49.820 --> 03:27:53.260]  Yeah, it makes me wonder why he hasn't done that because it's such a simple thing.
[03:27:53.260 --> 03:27:56.660]  And it costs the federal government nothing, essentially.
[03:27:56.660 --> 03:27:58.140]  Maybe a little bit of coordination overhead.
[03:27:58.140 --> 03:27:59.340]  Yeah, a little bit, maybe.
[03:27:59.340 --> 03:28:01.260]  Yeah, but people would volunteer for this.
[03:28:01.260 --> 03:28:02.260]  You bet.
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:03.700]  Okay, so let's get back to Spartan training.
[03:28:03.700 --> 03:28:06.220]  We've got under a minute left in this segment.
[03:28:06.220 --> 03:28:10.460]  What else do people, I mean, what actually do people get trained to do?
[03:28:10.460 --> 03:28:11.460]  Is it?
[03:28:11.460 --> 03:28:14.940]  Well, we would certainly teach them, of course, use of force.
[03:28:14.940 --> 03:28:16.500]  We would teach them the force continuum.
[03:28:16.500 --> 03:28:19.460]  We would teach them how to use our weapons effectively and safely.
[03:28:19.460 --> 03:28:23.140]  We would teach them first aid for themselves and for others, for victims.
[03:28:23.140 --> 03:28:27.860]  I mean, essentially, what you would want to have someone know how to do to respond to
[03:28:27.860 --> 03:28:29.180]  an active shooter.
[03:28:29.180 --> 03:28:30.860]  Okay, that makes perfect sense.
[03:28:30.860 --> 03:28:32.380]  I want to ask you a few more details about that.
[03:28:32.380 --> 03:28:34.380]  It's the Spartan program under Oathkeepers.
[03:28:34.380 --> 03:28:35.380]  That's good.
[03:28:35.380 --> 03:28:37.220]  Okay, oathkeepers.org is the website, folks.
[03:28:37.220 --> 03:28:40.180]  We're going to continue with Stuart Rhodes on the other side of this break.
[03:28:40.180 --> 03:28:43.340]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the Alex Jones show.
[03:28:43.340 --> 03:28:44.340]  Stay with us.
[03:28:44.340 --> 03:28:46.340]  We'll be right back with much more.
[03:28:46.340 --> 03:28:48.340]  It's fun, right?
[03:28:48.340 --> 03:28:49.340]  Transgender.
[03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:50.340]  You know...
[03:28:50.340 --> 03:28:56.340]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[03:28:56.340 --> 03:28:59.620]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:28:59.620 --> 03:29:01.500]  Not a sunny-bay heating pad.
[03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:06.500]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:09.820]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny-bay heating pad.
[03:29:09.820 --> 03:29:13.620]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways
[03:29:13.620 --> 03:29:16.180]  to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:29:16.180 --> 03:29:21.020]  Sunny-bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work, and
[03:29:21.020 --> 03:29:25.580]  have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[03:29:25.580 --> 03:29:27.100]  Why take another pill?
[03:29:27.100 --> 03:29:31.380]  Many people use our sunny-bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[03:29:31.380 --> 03:29:36.060]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[03:29:36.060 --> 03:29:39.340]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.

[03:32:57.260 --> 03:33:08.460]  Political Outrage turns bloody in Berkeley.
[03:33:08.460 --> 03:33:13.740]  Our KPIX 5 crews were right in the middle of the chaos as both Trump supporters and
[03:33:13.740 --> 03:33:18.780]  anti-Trump activists come to blows.
[03:33:18.780 --> 03:33:22.860]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center, around
[03:33:22.860 --> 03:33:27.420]  the corner and away from police protection on St. Carlo Street, a mob mentality took
[03:33:27.420 --> 03:33:28.420]  over.
[03:33:28.420 --> 03:33:35.260]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[03:33:35.260 --> 03:33:38.060]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, all my staff.
[03:33:38.060 --> 03:33:40.060]  These were pure attacks.
[03:33:40.060 --> 03:33:45.340]  Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly left this building last night and walked right
[03:33:45.340 --> 03:33:46.340]  into danger.
[03:33:46.340 --> 03:33:50.860]  This Trump supporter was the first casualty of the day, with blood streaming out of his
[03:33:50.860 --> 03:33:51.860]  face.
[03:33:51.860 --> 03:34:19.460]  We're saying if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right
[03:34:19.460 --> 03:34:24.460]  to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[03:34:24.460 --> 03:34:26.060]  It got ugly.
[03:34:26.060 --> 03:34:32.820]  Violence erupting at the event is fight, broke out, fifth, flying between Trump supporters
[03:34:32.820 --> 03:34:34.940]  and anti-Trump supporters.
[03:34:34.940 --> 03:34:35.940]  It gets pretty ugly.
[03:34:35.940 --> 03:34:39.340]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent
[03:34:39.340 --> 03:34:40.340]  footage.
[03:34:40.340 --> 03:34:41.340]  Do you want to fight?
[03:34:41.340 --> 03:34:42.340]  Give it up, Elise!
[03:34:42.340 --> 03:34:43.340]  You got one!
[03:34:43.340 --> 03:34:44.340]  Get up!
[03:34:44.340 --> 03:34:45.340]  Organize your say today's rally.
[03:34:45.340 --> 03:34:46.340]  It's a torment.
[03:34:46.340 --> 03:34:47.340]  All right.
[03:34:47.340 --> 03:34:53.860]  So that's a look at some of the violence that Antifa carries out in the name of what
[03:34:53.860 --> 03:34:54.860]  peace?
[03:34:54.860 --> 03:34:55.860]  I don't know.
[03:34:55.860 --> 03:34:56.860]  They're insane.
[03:34:56.860 --> 03:34:58.780]  Antifa is a domestic terrorism group.
[03:34:58.780 --> 03:35:00.660]  They are instigating violence.
[03:35:00.660 --> 03:35:05.740]  They wear masks to hide their identity so that they can get away with these felony assaults.
[03:35:05.740 --> 03:35:07.740]  They attack innocent people.
[03:35:07.740 --> 03:35:08.980]  You saw some of the footage there.
[03:35:08.980 --> 03:35:11.820]  That's just a small sample, as you're well aware.
[03:35:11.820 --> 03:35:13.020]  This is why you founded your group.
[03:35:13.020 --> 03:35:18.140]  So let's talk about this Antifa violence and where, I mean, obviously you think it's
[03:35:18.140 --> 03:35:22.940]  important enough to train a group to defend innocent people against that violence.
[03:35:22.940 --> 03:35:23.940]  Absolutely.
[03:35:23.940 --> 03:35:30.140]  Is that because you see this Antifa violence escalating to a point of, I don't know if
[03:35:30.140 --> 03:35:32.820]  I want to say it, but where do you see it's going?
[03:35:32.820 --> 03:35:35.620]  Well, eventually it could go kinetic.
[03:35:35.620 --> 03:35:39.500]  The use of bombs, they could go full weather underground and when they do that, whether
[03:35:39.500 --> 03:35:45.940]  it's with handguns or rifles or with pipe bombs, at that point we could be into a full
[03:35:45.940 --> 03:35:46.940]  blown civil war.
[03:35:46.940 --> 03:35:48.700]  We could escalate to that.
[03:35:48.700 --> 03:35:53.220]  We have seen Antifa groups, I think one recently in California announced that they intended
[03:35:53.220 --> 03:35:59.380]  to shoot patriots and Trump supporters and start the revolution, which I guess is some
[03:35:59.380 --> 03:36:02.060]  communist left wing revolution.
[03:36:02.060 --> 03:36:06.460]  And I've seen videos of them training with guns, although they're horrible shots.
[03:36:06.460 --> 03:36:10.140]  They miss at 20 yards with a rifle.
[03:36:10.140 --> 03:36:11.260]  It's so bad.
[03:36:11.260 --> 03:36:14.660]  It's almost comical, but they think that they're going to do this.
[03:36:14.660 --> 03:36:15.660]  They're delusional.
[03:36:15.660 --> 03:36:16.660]  Right.
[03:36:16.660 --> 03:36:20.260]  But that may mean that they're going to try it because they don't know how quickly they'll
[03:36:20.260 --> 03:36:21.260]  be defeated.
[03:36:21.260 --> 03:36:22.540]  That's why I bring up the weather underground.
[03:36:22.540 --> 03:36:24.060]  They were delusional as well.
[03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:27.380]  And yet they still pipe bombed police stations and buildings.
[03:36:27.380 --> 03:36:30.260]  They still cause a lot of damage.
[03:36:30.260 --> 03:36:37.620]  And so the difference now is that if an organized group as large as Antifa across the country
[03:36:37.620 --> 03:36:44.620]  who are seen as puppets of George Soros, if they were to go and, for example, kill a poor
[03:36:44.620 --> 03:36:47.980]  patrol family or an ICE family, they'd be on.
[03:36:47.980 --> 03:36:52.100]  I think you would see an extermination of Antifa in about a week across the country.
[03:36:52.100 --> 03:36:53.100]  What do you mean?
[03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:58.540]  Well, I think at that point, retired police officers and veterans would just hunt them
[03:36:58.540 --> 03:36:59.540]  down.
[03:36:59.540 --> 03:37:00.540]  Yeah.
[03:37:00.540 --> 03:37:02.740]  Just take them out.
[03:37:02.740 --> 03:37:03.740]  But they don't know who they are.
[03:37:03.740 --> 03:37:07.660]  I mean, that's the point of the masks is you don't have the identities of many of the
[03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:08.660]  Antifa people.
[03:37:08.660 --> 03:37:12.820]  So that tends to embolden them into thinking that they could carry out these kinds of killings
[03:37:12.820 --> 03:37:13.820]  or attacks.
[03:37:13.820 --> 03:37:16.260]  Well, they would never be able to assemble again in a black block.
[03:37:16.260 --> 03:37:17.260]  It wouldn't happen.
[03:37:17.260 --> 03:37:19.620]  They'd be wiped off the face of the earth if they did.
[03:37:19.620 --> 03:37:26.340]  So you believe that there are enough retired law enforcement, retired military, border
[03:37:26.340 --> 03:37:31.660]  patrol and so on, who would rise to that occasion if, like you said, let's say if a border patrol
[03:37:31.660 --> 03:37:35.380]  family were executed by Antifa, it would be over for Antifa.
[03:37:35.380 --> 03:37:37.100]  I think so.
[03:37:37.100 --> 03:37:43.340]  Wouldn't there be then current law enforcement response to that to try to local police?
[03:37:43.340 --> 03:37:48.980]  I mean, a lot of local police in cities like Los Angeles aren't exactly pro-America, all
[03:37:48.980 --> 03:37:49.980]  of them.
[03:37:49.980 --> 03:37:50.980]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:37:50.980 --> 03:37:51.980]  Right.
[03:37:51.980 --> 03:37:52.980]  Yeah.
[03:37:52.980 --> 03:37:53.980]  I mean, we're talking about a civil war.
[03:37:53.980 --> 03:37:54.980]  Okay.
[03:37:54.980 --> 03:37:58.900]  And what side they're on, depending on one county to another, in California, for example.
[03:37:58.900 --> 03:37:59.900]  Yeah.
[03:37:59.900 --> 03:38:00.900]  You cross the county lines.
[03:38:00.900 --> 03:38:02.260]  You're in Bloor or Red State, basically.
[03:38:02.260 --> 03:38:03.260]  Wow.
[03:38:03.260 --> 03:38:04.420]  One or the other.
[03:38:04.420 --> 03:38:05.420]  So we don't want that.
[03:38:05.420 --> 03:38:06.740]  Be very clear about that.
[03:38:06.740 --> 03:38:07.740]  We don't want that.
[03:38:07.740 --> 03:38:09.100]  We prefer the law enforcement handle it.
[03:38:09.100 --> 03:38:11.100]  I think Trump needs to crack down on them, frankly.
[03:38:11.100 --> 03:38:12.100]  Yeah.
[03:38:12.100 --> 03:38:13.300]  And I think the local police do also.
[03:38:13.300 --> 03:38:15.380]  But CNN is defending them.
[03:38:15.380 --> 03:38:16.380]  I mean, think about this.
[03:38:16.380 --> 03:38:21.140]  Not only does CNN blatantly lie with fake news reporting that they know is fake, you know,
[03:38:21.140 --> 03:38:23.940]  the Carl Bernstein piece recently, a great example.
[03:38:23.940 --> 03:38:29.620]  CNN defends Antifa and says that attacks on Antifa are, you know, criticism of Antifa
[03:38:29.620 --> 03:38:30.620]  is racism.
[03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:31.620]  Right.
[03:38:31.620 --> 03:38:32.620]  How is that racism?
[03:38:32.620 --> 03:38:33.620]  Well, that's all they got.
[03:38:33.620 --> 03:38:37.180]  This is what's kind of perverse about it, is that a lot of these young kids that are
[03:38:37.180 --> 03:38:41.140]  in these black blocks actually believe that they're fighting Nazis.
[03:38:41.140 --> 03:38:42.860]  They believe that I'm a Nazi.
[03:38:42.860 --> 03:38:43.860]  You're a Nazi.
[03:38:43.860 --> 03:38:47.300]  I mean, everybody's a Nazi who's not them, and they've been conditioned to believe that.
[03:38:47.300 --> 03:38:50.260]  It's basically what they're being conditioned to believe is anyone who believes in traditional
[03:38:50.260 --> 03:38:55.340]  American life or the Constitution is a racist because it's all inherently racist.
[03:38:55.340 --> 03:39:01.500]  So they think they're fighting Nazis, which is their delusion, and we, the patriots, we
[03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:07.380]  might be actually fighting Nazis, which is the fascist left, the fascist left, who are
[03:39:07.380 --> 03:39:11.820]  actually marching in the footsteps of the Red Shirts and the Third Reich, and they're
[03:39:11.820 --> 03:39:13.100]  the actual fascists.
[03:39:13.100 --> 03:39:14.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:39:14.260 --> 03:39:17.460]  So I guess it comes down to who's the real Nazi?
[03:39:17.460 --> 03:39:23.300]  Well, here's a sick, like I told my guys not too long ago, the perverse thing is you could
[03:39:23.300 --> 03:39:31.100]  wind up with these young kids dying in combat, being killed by veterans, and believing as
[03:39:31.100 --> 03:39:36.700]  they die that they're fighting a Nazi, and the Nazis killing them when all we are is
[03:39:36.700 --> 03:39:41.340]  these patriots who want to be left alone and want our families safe.
[03:39:41.340 --> 03:39:46.740]  And who are operating actually in the reflection of the great Americans who defeated the Nazis,
[03:39:46.740 --> 03:39:52.180]  by the way, the greatest generation that fought the Nazis, the actual Nazis, stormed the beaches.
[03:39:52.180 --> 03:39:55.460]  We took out the Nazis and we'll do it again if we have to.
[03:39:55.460 --> 03:39:56.460]  Or the commies.
[03:39:56.460 --> 03:39:57.460]  Or the commies, exactly.
[03:39:57.460 --> 03:39:58.460]  All right.
[03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:03.700]  Now, what about these young Antifa delusional terrorists?
[03:40:03.700 --> 03:40:05.300]  I've seen the training videos.
[03:40:05.300 --> 03:40:08.380]  I've seen them do maybe a total of four sit-ups.
[03:40:08.380 --> 03:40:11.100]  I've seen them attempt push-ups.
[03:40:11.100 --> 03:40:13.580]  They think they're badasses.
[03:40:13.580 --> 03:40:16.860]  How quickly would they actually be defeated if this went full kinetic?
[03:40:16.860 --> 03:40:20.060]  Well, like I said, it depends if it was a stand-up fight or not, right?
[03:40:20.060 --> 03:40:24.340]  If they were trying to have someone on black block, it would be over in about two seconds.
[03:40:24.340 --> 03:40:26.100]  But of course, what is that term you're using, I'm sorry?
[03:40:26.100 --> 03:40:27.100]  Black block.
[03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:28.100]  What's a black block?
[03:40:28.100 --> 03:40:31.620]  They dress all alike, from head to toe, so that you can't identify them.
[03:40:31.620 --> 03:40:32.620]  Oh, okay.
[03:40:32.620 --> 03:40:34.220]  And that only works when people aren't shooting them.
[03:40:34.220 --> 03:40:36.700]  When they're shooting them, the guy in the black mask gets shot.
[03:40:36.700 --> 03:40:39.020]  It's pretty easy to figure that out, right?
[03:40:39.020 --> 03:40:40.020]  Right, right.
[03:40:40.020 --> 03:40:43.660]  You don't work unless you're, the only mask only work when we are within the bounds of
[03:40:43.660 --> 03:40:46.580]  the law and trying to be as civil as possible.
[03:40:46.580 --> 03:40:47.580]  Then they can get away with it.
[03:40:47.580 --> 03:40:50.220]  But once the shooting starts, you don't want to be wearing an Antifa mask.
[03:40:50.220 --> 03:40:51.220]  No, absolutely not.
[03:40:51.220 --> 03:40:52.220]  Yeah, that's a bullet magnet.
[03:40:52.220 --> 03:40:53.220]  Right, right.
[03:40:53.220 --> 03:40:54.220]  What about a red scarf?
[03:40:54.220 --> 03:40:55.220]  Or that, yeah.
[03:40:55.220 --> 03:40:56.220]  What about a linen T-shirt?
[03:40:56.220 --> 03:40:57.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:40:57.220 --> 03:40:58.220]  The hammer and sickle scarf.
[03:40:58.220 --> 03:40:59.220]  How about that?
[03:40:59.220 --> 03:41:00.220]  Shake it for a T-shirt.
[03:41:00.220 --> 03:41:01.220]  It's like, yeah, not good.
[03:41:01.220 --> 03:41:02.220]  You can pretty much see that at about 1,000 yards, right?
[03:41:02.220 --> 03:41:03.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:41:03.220 --> 03:41:04.220]  Okay.
[03:41:04.220 --> 03:41:05.220]  And I know veterans.
[03:41:05.220 --> 03:41:07.660]  I know one veteran in Montana, an army vet.
[03:41:07.660 --> 03:41:10.180]  He takes his elk at 960 yards.
[03:41:10.180 --> 03:41:11.180]  Right.
[03:41:11.180 --> 03:41:12.180]  That's how long he shoots.
[03:41:12.180 --> 03:41:13.180]  That's how far he shoots.
[03:41:13.180 --> 03:41:16.260]  You got guys like that have been shooting, you know, all their lives.
[03:41:16.260 --> 03:41:20.460]  And so the Antifa are not going to train up within a few months or years to match that.
[03:41:20.460 --> 03:41:21.460]  No, no.
[03:41:21.460 --> 03:41:25.660]  I actually shoot at 1,000 yards plus out to 1,500 with a 300 win mag.
[03:41:25.660 --> 03:41:26.820]  Here you go.
[03:41:26.820 --> 03:41:32.060]  But it took many, many years of training and the wind still, you can't fight the wind.
[03:41:32.060 --> 03:41:36.620]  If you don't have a wind call correctly, yeah, you're six feet off, right?
[03:41:36.620 --> 03:41:37.620]  Exactly.
[03:41:37.620 --> 03:41:39.900]  So yeah, they're not going to overnight.
[03:41:39.900 --> 03:41:41.060]  They think it's a video game, man.
[03:41:41.060 --> 03:41:43.620]  They think you line up the crosshairs and you pull the trigger.
[03:41:43.620 --> 03:41:44.620]  That's it.
[03:41:44.620 --> 03:41:45.620]  Right.
[03:41:45.620 --> 03:41:46.620]  They don't know anything about ballistics.
[03:41:46.620 --> 03:41:47.620]  Exactly.
[03:41:47.620 --> 03:41:48.620]  They don't.
[03:41:48.620 --> 03:41:49.620]  Okay.
[03:41:49.620 --> 03:41:51.780]  So your assessment is, and I would agree with you that they would be defeated very, very
[03:41:51.780 --> 03:41:54.020]  quickly if it went kinetic.
[03:41:54.020 --> 03:41:56.140]  But what if they ran a false flag on themselves?
[03:41:56.140 --> 03:41:57.140]  Right.
[03:41:57.140 --> 03:41:58.140]  Right.
[03:41:58.140 --> 03:42:03.140]  Then they could get public opinion shifted against the Patriots to say they could stage
[03:42:03.140 --> 03:42:08.380]  Patriots murdering, you know, a bunch of Antifa people and blame you.
[03:42:08.380 --> 03:42:09.620]  It could.
[03:42:09.620 --> 03:42:13.020]  But one of the reasons why we started, like last year, we stepped out in Berkeley twice
[03:42:13.020 --> 03:42:16.580]  and guarded public events against Antifa successfully.
[03:42:16.580 --> 03:42:17.860]  We did a coalition.
[03:42:17.860 --> 03:42:18.860]  It was bikers.
[03:42:18.860 --> 03:42:20.180]  It was 3% of groups.
[03:42:20.180 --> 03:42:23.380]  It was small militia groups in California, and then it was us.
[03:42:23.380 --> 03:42:27.100]  And we brought police professionals in as leadership and that combined element kept
[03:42:27.100 --> 03:42:28.100]  things safe.
[03:42:28.100 --> 03:42:29.100]  I see.
[03:42:29.100 --> 03:42:35.060]  So your overall posture, just to summarize, is defensive, peaceful, but ready to respond
[03:42:35.060 --> 03:42:37.820]  if they, if Antifa escalates the violence.
[03:42:37.820 --> 03:42:38.820]  Right.
[03:42:38.820 --> 03:42:39.820]  Well, we want to put this protection.
[03:42:39.820 --> 03:42:43.940]  I'm just saying what would happen in general if they started a civil war or they'd be defeated.
[03:42:43.940 --> 03:42:44.940]  Absolutely.
[03:42:44.940 --> 03:42:45.940]  Right.
[03:42:45.940 --> 03:42:46.940]  Right.
[03:42:46.940 --> 03:42:47.940]  I tend to agree with you.
[03:42:47.940 --> 03:42:48.940]  We'll be right back with Stuart Rhodes.
[03:42:48.940 --> 03:42:53.140]  More straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:53.140 --> 03:42:54.140]  We knew it was coming.
[03:42:54.140 --> 03:42:56.140]  The whole thing was for me, leg.
[03:42:56.140 --> 03:43:02.140]  You know, the story just somehow first collapsed, anything helped.
[03:43:02.140 --> 03:43:05.080]  And once I think of it, that's no content.
[03:43:05.080 --> 03:43:07.060]  It's just everything that's left.
[03:43:07.060 --> 03:43:09.900]  That becomes the mind of a company right now.
[03:43:09.900 --> 03:43:11.940]  It's always been a part of me.
[03:43:11.940 --> 03:43:14.820]  And I've two more to do, and you'll see it for yourself.
[03:43:14.820 --> 03:43:18.780]  I've talked to you a little bit, and I know you heard me.
[03:43:18.780 --> 03:43:25.220]  So tell me what, if you're getting mixed up in your protest and you're all on a forever

[03:46:59.260 --> 03:47:18.420]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:18.420 --> 03:47:35.100]  And we continue joined by Oath Keepers Stuart Rhodes here in studio at the Alex Jones show today.
[03:47:35.100 --> 03:47:39.460]  This is Mike Adams asking the tough questions. Actually, I do have a couple of tough questions
[03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:46.300]  for you in this final segment. Someone listening to what you said in the previous segments might
[03:47:46.300 --> 03:47:51.820]  freak out if they're, especially if they're leftists, and they're like, oh my God, did he just
[03:47:51.820 --> 03:47:57.580]  describe that patriots are going to murder all Antifa people? Of course, that's not what you said,
[03:47:57.580 --> 03:48:03.020]  but they take everything out of context. But you did say that if Antifa kills, let's say,
[03:48:03.020 --> 03:48:09.340]  a border patrol family, that probably there would be a reaction that would eliminate them all.
[03:48:09.340 --> 03:48:14.380]  You're on open season. Right. But I'm going to give you an opportunity to clarify what you mean,
[03:48:14.380 --> 03:48:19.580]  because you're not talking about death squads running around the country killing Antifa people,
[03:48:19.580 --> 03:48:26.860]  right? What are you? People would see this, this is what it's perverse about. Like I said,
[03:48:26.860 --> 03:48:33.620]  they would die believing that they were being killed by some Nazi death squad when all what's
[03:48:33.620 --> 03:48:38.620]  really going on is a reaction to their violence and their terrorism and the hunting down of terrorists.
[03:48:38.620 --> 03:48:43.940]  We don't want to see that. We prefer to have law enforcement do it. But I think that if you have
[03:48:43.940 --> 03:48:50.100]  a retired border patrol officer and he's identified on a black black or Antifa cell in his community,
[03:48:50.660 --> 03:48:55.540]  and he knows it's it's now open season on his brothers by Antifa, he's going to go whack him.
[03:48:55.540 --> 03:48:59.860]  Now, I gotta say, when you use this term black block, I think you're going to be accused of racism.
[03:49:00.500 --> 03:49:04.340]  No, it's it's a block of black clothes. No, no, but I hear you. They're all white kids.
[03:49:04.340 --> 03:49:08.260]  And they're all white. I know they're white kids wearing black masks. But CNN said that
[03:49:08.260 --> 03:49:12.980]  Antifa is an African American group, which is nonsense as mostly these privileged white kids
[03:49:12.980 --> 03:49:17.700]  who again, can't even do push ups. And they get they get knocked out with one punch, you know,
[03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:23.300]  at the protest. But when you're using that term black block, it sounds I'm somebody's going to
[03:49:23.300 --> 03:49:30.180]  take it out of context. Oh, tough. That's that's that's the term. Okay. All right. Well, they,
[03:49:30.180 --> 03:49:34.980]  you're right, they chose their own black colors, even though they're mostly white kids wearing
[03:49:34.980 --> 03:49:39.780]  wearing those those color, the race anyway, it's just I think it looks cool. You know,
[03:49:39.780 --> 03:49:44.180]  it's it's the anarchist black and red flag. So do you think that they think that they're
[03:49:44.180 --> 03:49:48.420]  scary looking? Yeah, because we kind of laugh at them. Actually, they think they're scary looking.
[03:49:48.420 --> 03:49:54.740]  We think they're hilarious. Yeah. But but they might say that that again, you know,
[03:49:54.740 --> 03:49:59.620]  that you're calling for violence or you're calling for pre violence in certain circumstances.
[03:49:59.620 --> 03:50:03.540]  I'm just being I'm just being predictive to be blunt and to say look, if the Civil War kicks
[03:50:03.540 --> 03:50:08.900]  off, we're going to lose. Okay, I can agree with that. The Civil War kicks off. They lose big
[03:50:08.900 --> 03:50:13.860]  time. I prefer though, I prefer that what we do, and this is what we went out last year.
[03:50:13.860 --> 03:50:18.020]  Big part of it was not just in Berkeley, but also in Portland and Boston all over the country.
[03:50:18.020 --> 03:50:24.500]  One of my big motivators was is I did not want to create leave a vacuum to be filled by the
[03:50:24.500 --> 03:50:28.340]  white nationalists who are also enemies of the Constitution. They hate the Constitution as well.
[03:50:28.340 --> 03:50:33.700]  That's correct. They do. They openly make fun of it all the time. So if we had not stepped out and
[03:50:33.700 --> 03:50:37.860]  protected these these gatherings, they were hoping that they would be the heroes and come in and be
[03:50:37.860 --> 03:50:42.180]  able to protect people and they would grow their their street cred and their authority, which is
[03:50:42.180 --> 03:50:45.620]  why they hate oath keepers, frankly. Well, how do you keep white nationalists out of your Spartan
[03:50:45.620 --> 03:50:50.420]  program? We same thing. We were going to vet them. We're hunting for them. If we find them in social
[03:50:50.420 --> 03:50:54.900]  media, otherwise identify them. We don't try them. So someone has a social media posts of white
[03:50:54.900 --> 03:51:01.940]  nationalists posts or white supremacist posts, JKK, whatever, you reject them. Absolutely. Yeah.
[03:51:01.940 --> 03:51:05.300]  Because they're because they're also domestic enemies of the Constitution. Right. There they
[03:51:05.300 --> 03:51:08.900]  are. Right. Actually, Dinesh D'Souza proved that in with his recent movie. Yeah, with Richard
[03:51:08.900 --> 03:51:13.860]  Benzio. Yeah, the guy's like, he's a Nazi. Yeah, he really is an actual Nazi. We found an actual
[03:51:13.860 --> 03:51:18.180]  Nazi. He's a real Nazi. I see. Okay. Finally, he's a national socialist. So you have national
[03:51:18.180 --> 03:51:22.260]  socialists and you have the international socialists on the left. Right. So you have two competing
[03:51:22.260 --> 03:51:26.980]  totalitarian ideologies and you're opposed to both of them. Absolutely. Of course. Right. Okay.
[03:51:26.980 --> 03:51:31.140]  Now, what about the the Sentinel program that you have? Tell us about that. Well, that is,
[03:51:31.140 --> 03:51:36.660]  that's a Oathkeeper only program. So if someone's in a Spartan program, we train them whether they
[03:51:36.660 --> 03:51:41.300]  join or not, whether they're another group or not, I don't care. But if they want to be part of our
[03:51:41.300 --> 03:51:45.620]  vetted teams, they have to join Oathkeepers. And we call those our Sentinel teams. And the primary
[03:51:45.620 --> 03:51:51.540]  function for them is to be people that we know we can rely on to go and protect a school or to
[03:51:51.540 --> 03:51:56.980]  show up at a critical event that we're protecting, like another for example. Now, so how does that
[03:51:56.980 --> 03:52:02.500]  team interlace with local law enforcement? Would the sheriff, for example, be given a phone call
[03:52:02.500 --> 03:52:06.740]  to say, hey, some of our Sentinel people are also going to show up to to assist? Does that
[03:52:06.740 --> 03:52:10.020]  work? We'd say we're going to we're going to come in like we did in Berkeley. I brought in,
[03:52:10.020 --> 03:52:15.220]  we had about 14 retired police officers and current serving, 12 of them from California,
[03:52:15.220 --> 03:52:19.140]  two from out of state, two out of state were the leadership. Now, John Caraman,
[03:52:19.140 --> 03:52:24.020]  our leader from the Rooftops in Ferguson, and a retired lieutenant from the DC Metro. So they
[03:52:24.020 --> 03:52:28.020]  came in, we had so we had them, they were armed because they can carry under under leosa, they
[03:52:28.020 --> 03:52:32.100]  can carry nationwide, even in the park in Berkeley, under what? Leosa, the law enforcement officer
[03:52:32.100 --> 03:52:36.180]  safety act. Oh, okay. Right. So so retired cop could carry even in the Berkeley park,
[03:52:36.180 --> 03:52:40.100]  where no one else was allowed to carry anything. I see, right. Retired cops can. So we had our
[03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:45.620]  retired cops carrying guns in the park ready in case there was anti-fog, you know, kinetic violence.
[03:52:45.620 --> 03:52:50.580]  And then you had veterans, about 75 veterans, military veterans who weren't armed, but who were,
[03:52:50.580 --> 03:52:53.620]  you know, wearing body armor and gloves and helmets and ready to go.
[03:52:53.620 --> 03:52:58.180]  I see. So combined forced element. Have you, have you ever had a situation where your group
[03:52:58.180 --> 03:53:04.420]  was called to an incident or a location and local law enforcement was very combative with you
[03:53:04.420 --> 03:53:08.980]  about that and say, you know, get out of here? Not so far, because that's the advantage of us
[03:53:08.980 --> 03:53:13.300]  having a lot of police officers. They go in ahead of time and lay us on. And among police
[03:53:13.300 --> 03:53:17.620]  officers, there's a mutual respect and they understand what they're doing and why. And
[03:53:17.620 --> 03:53:20.500]  they know that we're going to stay within the law. We know that we're only being defensive,
[03:53:20.500 --> 03:53:24.260]  and they know that our police officers were in charge. That's fascinating. Having you
[03:53:24.260 --> 03:53:28.340]  here in studio to be able to ask you these questions in person. But thanks for being here.
[03:53:28.340 --> 03:53:32.660]  So let me ask you this. You talk to a lot of cops, you know, I know a lot of cops too,
[03:53:32.660 --> 03:53:38.260]  but you know a lot more than I do. What is the feeling right now about where they think things
[03:53:38.260 --> 03:53:42.580]  are going? Because I just keep hearing a lot of red alerts across the board. What are you hearing?
[03:53:42.580 --> 03:53:49.700]  Same thing. They're very concerned that we're seeing a breakdown in our social cohesion.
[03:53:49.700 --> 03:53:54.660]  Yes. And we're seeing the precursor to a civil war. You know, they don't want to see it either.
[03:53:54.660 --> 03:54:00.420]  And your cops are all, honestly, your cops. I mean, the officers that are members of your group,
[03:54:00.420 --> 03:54:03.540]  they're all pro-second amendment, right? Absolutely. It's not anti-gun cops in your group.
[03:54:03.540 --> 03:54:10.580]  No. No. Okay. So they love the idea. I mean, you tell me if this is true or not. They love the
[03:54:10.580 --> 03:54:16.100]  idea of citizens being armed and trained. Absolutely. Right. Yeah, we had a panel of
[03:54:16.100 --> 03:54:21.060]  15 police officers and outkeepers put together a white paper on exactly how they would want to
[03:54:21.060 --> 03:54:25.940]  see schools protected. And it came down right along the same lines as Sheriff Judd's program.
[03:54:25.940 --> 03:54:30.020]  You let the teachers and staff who want to volunteer to be trained and carry guns in
[03:54:30.020 --> 03:54:34.580]  the school. You let parents who want to train the standard come in and be in volunteer. And
[03:54:34.580 --> 03:54:38.980]  you also let military and police veterans in the community do likewise. Absolutely.
[03:54:38.980 --> 03:54:43.460]  Well, it makes perfect sense because like you said early on, we can't just delegate
[03:54:43.460 --> 03:54:48.340]  security to some other group. It doesn't work. We are part of it. Right. Well, the citizens,
[03:54:48.340 --> 03:54:52.260]  the teachers themselves, this is what the Israelis figured out many decades ago,
[03:54:52.260 --> 03:54:57.300]  the pool of people being attacked by the shooter has to be the ones who defend the school.
[03:54:57.300 --> 03:54:59.780]  That's right. Because they're already there. They're always there. That's right. Teachers are
[03:54:59.780 --> 03:55:03.220]  always there. It's connected with the pilots. Why not arm of your pilot? Right. He's on the
[03:55:03.220 --> 03:55:06.820]  plane. He's on every plane. Right. Doesn't cost you any extra money at all. And the pilots I know
[03:55:06.820 --> 03:55:11.140]  are all good shooters anyway. You know, pilots have a lot of handguns. Yeah, a lot of them do.
[03:55:11.140 --> 03:55:15.620]  Yeah. They're smart guys. I mean, to fly a plane, you have to be a smart individual. Yeah.
[03:55:15.620 --> 03:55:20.580]  And they're good with ballistics and everything. Yep. Yeah. Okay. We got just a couple minutes
[03:55:20.580 --> 03:55:25.540]  left. First of all, I just want to say I think it's great what you're doing and thank you for
[03:55:25.540 --> 03:55:29.780]  your leadership and for your compassion for this country. I know that you get a lot of hate
[03:55:29.780 --> 03:55:34.020]  as all of us do who are pro-America. Right. You probably get death-threaded too, right?
[03:55:34.020 --> 03:55:40.180]  Oh, yeah. Of course. In the end, when this all plays out over the next, let's say,
[03:55:40.180 --> 03:55:45.540]  through two terms of a Trump presidency, by the time we get to 2024, where are we in America at
[03:55:45.540 --> 03:55:52.020]  that point in your view? It doesn't have to be a prediction, but just trend-wise. Where do you
[03:55:52.020 --> 03:55:56.340]  think we are? Well, I think they're trying to isolate him and just run the clock out on Trump.
[03:55:56.340 --> 03:55:59.540]  And I think we have to make sure that we take advantage of this, break with the irons hot.
[03:55:59.540 --> 03:56:04.500]  There's too much complacency out there. I think we need to be organizing and getting prepared
[03:56:05.140 --> 03:56:08.820]  while we have this window of opportunity where you don't have the federal government breathing
[03:56:08.820 --> 03:56:14.500]  down your neck. So local. What about the fact that the Democrats are very strong in the cities,
[03:56:14.500 --> 03:56:21.380]  but rural America has, of course, a lot more patriots. But how, if engagements are in the
[03:56:21.380 --> 03:56:26.340]  cities, isn't that kind of a home court advantage for the antifa terrorists? One of our strongest
[03:56:26.340 --> 03:56:30.020]  chapters now is in Berkeley, California. Is that right? Yeah. One of our best chapters
[03:56:30.020 --> 03:56:34.820]  is the Bay Area of California now. Because of their stepping out twice, they've developed their
[03:56:34.820 --> 03:56:39.780]  cohesion. This is why we're doing this program is we want to see more of that. We want to see
[03:56:39.780 --> 03:56:44.900]  more patriots coming together, realizing they can do it and getting them on the job. How many
[03:56:44.900 --> 03:56:48.740]  total members in Oath Keepers right now? Right now about 30,000, but we want to double that. We're
[03:56:48.740 --> 03:56:52.580]  doing a membership drive right now and hopefully we'll double it. Is there a feed to be a member?
[03:56:52.580 --> 03:56:58.900]  40 bucks a year. Okay, so nothing. Basically. Right, right. One box of ammo. Yeah. Right.
[03:56:58.900 --> 03:57:05.940]  Okay, so everybody check out oathkeepers.org. If this is interesting to you, join the organization
[03:57:05.940 --> 03:57:10.660]  and check out the Spartan training program. Is that starting now? Yes. They can go on the website
[03:57:10.660 --> 03:57:14.180]  right now and find the form to apply. And you don't need to be an oath keeper to do that,
[03:57:14.180 --> 03:57:16.820]  but you're more than welcome to join with your private service or not. You're welcome.
[03:57:16.820 --> 03:57:21.540]  You have to have firearms experience to join? No. So no experience? Yeah. Wow. That's the point.
[03:57:21.540 --> 03:57:25.380]  We'll train you. You just bring your pistol? Yep. Should they bring it loaded or unloaded?
[03:57:25.380 --> 03:57:30.420]  That's what I thought. I don't go to gun training classes anymore with groups of
[03:57:30.420 --> 03:57:33.300]  newbies because they're too dangerous. They walk around pointing at everything.
[03:57:33.300 --> 03:57:36.740]  Okay. It depends on their training. It does depend. All right. Well, thank you, Stuart.
[03:57:36.740 --> 03:57:39.860]  It's great to have you in the studio. Thanks everybody. That's the show. That's a wrap. We'll
