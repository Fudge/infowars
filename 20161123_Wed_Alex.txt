[00:00.000 --> 00:22.120]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info
[00:22.120 --> 00:29.320]  War. I was saying that the night the book was being overnighted it just arrived in the mail
[00:29.320 --> 00:35.840]  just arrived via FedEx boom they're in the break and I just had two minutes to read I cannot
[00:35.840 --> 00:39.760]  because I love history I can't wait to read this new book scorched earth restoring the country
[00:39.760 --> 00:45.760]  after Obama I opened to a page about Edmund Burke supporting the British Empire but not supporting
[00:45.760 --> 00:51.480]  the Empire erasing countries cultures which globalism is doing and it's he's so sophisticated
[00:51.480 --> 00:56.760]  he's probably the smartest talk show host out there when it comes to wide-ranging knowledge
[00:56.760 --> 01:03.200]  George Norrie is really smart as well when it comes to passion and taking the globalist on
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.120]  and being well-read I mean I'm right up there with Savage but Savage really is a smart guy put
[01:09.120 --> 01:12.360]  it to you this way I don't learn a lot of stuff from other people on radio they just take a
[01:12.360 --> 01:16.520]  couple topics repeat it over and over again take phone calls they don't even want to be there they
[01:16.520 --> 01:20.320]  don't even want to be on air they don't care they just want money Savage doesn't even need to be
[01:20.320 --> 01:24.960]  on air he's a very successful person and that's why I admire what he's doing and his plan and
[01:24.960 --> 01:28.000]  I've been listening to the show he's been talking about scorched earth I haven't read it yet is an
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.080]  excellent one to take back this country in this world so Michael Savage joining us at the start
[01:32.080 --> 01:36.000]  of the next segment in fact there he is he just came and sat down there so we're going to come
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.440]  back right after this break and go to Michael Savage first off let's jam another phone call
[01:41.440 --> 01:48.680]  in here who is up next let's go ahead and take a call here from Chris in Virginia you're on the
[01:48.680 --> 01:55.960]  air go ahead all right with Hillary falling and coughing and stumbling all over the place I can't
[01:55.960 --> 02:02.040]  help but think to what Larry Nichols was saying about her trying to use that as sympathy points
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.680]  for the debates will you think about that you know a lot of people said months ago look out Hillary
[02:06.680 --> 02:11.160]  could be trying to get sympathy she could play on this poor little her the problem is the media
[02:11.160 --> 02:16.720]  lied about it she lied about it she's clearly really sick okay I mean this is not fake she
[02:16.720 --> 02:21.920]  could try to spin that now and use that crisis but I think I don't think Hillary's long for this
[02:21.920 --> 02:28.080]  world the word we've got from insiders is brain tumor was cut out in 2012 brain tumor is back and
[02:28.080 --> 02:32.880]  is growing but regardless the media only shows her being a little bit dizzy they don't show her
[02:32.880 --> 02:39.200]  falling on her face so what this is really about is discrediting the media what do you think I think
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.120]  it is about discrediting the media and also I think that they're trying to put it out there with
[02:43.120 --> 02:47.760]  the pneumonia thing even though it's a fake and it's a lie if they put it out there now before
[02:47.760 --> 02:53.760]  the debates it gives them some kind of credibility going in there saying that oh she was had pneumonia
[02:53.760 --> 02:59.040]  oh she was sick well I totally agree with you that this whole thing about the monies bowl I mean
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.120]  she hasn't had coughing fits for years from pneumonia she hasn't been feigning and falling
[03:03.120 --> 03:08.080]  down having blood clots from pneumonia first she said on Sunday that it was just hot out there
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.400]  and she said oh I was diagnosed with pneumonia she didn't go to the hospital she went to Chelsea's
[03:12.400 --> 03:17.440]  10 million dollar pad she had 6 million a year from the Clinton Foundation swindle so she could
[03:17.440 --> 03:23.360]  quote then walk out and hug the little girl behind the police line the secret service line it doesn't
[03:23.360 --> 03:30.080]  get more staged in Pyongyang North Korea thanks for the call Chris now we're going to go to John and

[03:38.880 --> 03:43.600]  going to go to break and come back with Michael Savage to talk about currently what's happening
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.360]  the dirty tricks he thinks they're going to play and how we counter them and then
[03:47.920 --> 03:55.040]  how we would restore this country if a Donald J Trump gets in so when you talk about deplorables
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.520]  I've been attacked by name I know that the vice presidential candidate attacked me again and
[04:01.520 --> 04:06.880]  said I'm one of the top deplorables but I tell you we're talking to maybe the king deplorable
[04:06.880 --> 04:11.840]  when we come back according to the globalist the leftist the scum the communist the socialist
[04:11.840 --> 04:16.160]  the new world order people because Michael Savage has been one of the chief thorns in their side
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.240]  for decades so we're going to ask one of the top deplorables where he thinks this is going and how
[04:22.240 --> 04:27.360]  we defeat them straight ahead the book that's just now coming out is scorched earth restoring

[05:31.600 --> 05:36.960]  because of a broken pump all of this is according to the nuclear regulatory agency it turns out that

[09:39.200 --> 09:45.920]  facing two minutes to midnight well number one you are you are really the field marshal of it all
[09:45.920 --> 09:51.840]  alex come on we know that they're more afraid of you and info wars than almost anyone else in
[09:51.840 --> 09:57.120]  the media i mean you matt drudge there aren't too many left that's what's worrisome isn't it alex
[09:57.120 --> 10:05.360]  and you were named by this evil machine specifically and i would say that you know you say hyperbole in
[10:05.360 --> 10:10.480]  this and that we all won bad election away from losing everything which is on the back of my book
[10:10.480 --> 10:16.560]  cover and i don't know that we can recover from obama scorched earth policies we know he's trampled
[10:16.560 --> 10:21.280]  the constitution and i don't know how any of your listeners you know whatever the side they're on
[10:21.280 --> 10:25.600]  you know you know and i know you get all the opposition listening and i'd like all of the
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.720]  good progressives will listen to alex to see if they can nail them to a cross tell me that one
[10:30.720 --> 10:37.360]  of these things has not magnified under this cretin in the white house is this not becoming a third
[10:37.360 --> 10:45.520]  world nation of terror check yes riots check black lives matter mobs check black lives matter chaos
[10:45.520 --> 10:51.600]  check barack obama terror riots mobs and chaos this is a novelty in american history i haven't
[10:51.600 --> 10:55.920]  seen anything like this historically since the sixties and before that when was the last time
[10:55.920 --> 11:00.080]  you've seen america like this and the beauty of all of this alex is how he's gotten away with it
[11:00.080 --> 11:06.960]  because you've got to give him credit barry obama is the slickest salesman of communism the world
[11:06.960 --> 11:16.000]  has ever ever discovered no screaming no yelling no threats just a silk smooth good-looking nice guy
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.200]  with a lovely wife and children selling the most evil poison the world has ever ever
[11:21.200 --> 11:27.840]  been asked to ingest and look how far he's gotten and every time he gets away with another outrage
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.760]  against this nation he raises the stakes like a junkie he needs a higher dose of insult
[11:33.760 --> 11:39.600]  in order to maintain the high am i wrong alex you're dead on mr savage dr savage please continue
[11:41.200 --> 11:46.560]  so the question is okay i'm i'm complaining about him i'm saying she's worse which is true which is
[11:46.560 --> 11:53.680]  ludicrous she says america wants change from what from the same policies she's going to continue
[11:53.680 --> 11:59.200]  she's suddenly not a progressive lunatic when we wait she's going to change obama's policies in
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.720]  which way make them worse how she can't go the other way and then she'd be donald trump
[12:04.720 --> 12:09.280]  so it means she's going to make it even worse than him that's if she remembers what she's
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.120]  supposed to do and that's doubtful as you well know because she doesn't know how many times she
[12:13.120 --> 12:20.400]  fainted uh so the point is how do we uncouple this insanity it is going to be really hard
[12:21.120 --> 12:26.560]  you know and i know there was a you act in the 1950s and it's a dirty word of the most dirty of
[12:26.560 --> 12:32.720]  words the house of unamerican activities committee which was run by one of the great american patriots
[12:32.720 --> 12:39.600]  senator mccarthy he has been completely decimated by the left mccarthy was a tailgunner in world
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.720]  war two one of the most dangerous positions you could ever have in an airplane right belly gunner
[12:44.720 --> 12:51.120]  b-24 many the target was the tail that's what they attacked listen what the left did to him they
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.040]  called them they mocked them and called them tail gunner joe and others they took his heroism
[12:55.040 --> 12:59.920]  and tried to turn it into a mockery that was in the 50s alex to show you who they were already
[12:59.920 --> 13:06.880]  the communists so what was mccarthy saying this great war hero he was saying that hollywood had
[13:06.880 --> 13:12.960]  been infiltrated by communists the journalists haven't infiltrated by communists academia had
[13:12.960 --> 13:19.360]  been infiltrated by communists and the government itself well what happened was they had the hearings
[13:19.360 --> 13:26.000]  they ruined him they destroyed the man and then what happened in the 1990s i'm sure you remember
[13:26.000 --> 13:32.400]  the book the venona papers came out it was a soviet russian publication turned out it was all true
[13:32.400 --> 13:37.680]  the russian documents came out it was worse than what mccarthy was saying worse it confirmed who in
[13:37.680 --> 13:44.000]  hollywood who in academia who in government was in fact an operative of the soviet union
[13:44.880 --> 13:51.840]  so they were subversives uak was exactly on target i say the only way we can save this nation
[13:51.840 --> 13:57.040]  is not talking about it but by rooting out the subversives in the united states of america and
[13:57.040 --> 14:02.080]  i know many libertarians are afraid of this for fear that it will turn on them well let's put that
[14:02.080 --> 14:05.200]  fear aside for the moment in fact let me just add this since you're saying this because this is
[14:05.200 --> 14:11.120]  the point i want to make if you look at the globalist if you look at their leftist they're saying
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.040]  the alt right can't be tolerated they're saying we need to be shut down and arrested
[14:15.040 --> 14:19.040]  hillary says she's going to shut down right mark that means drudge you they say they're
[14:19.040 --> 14:23.680]  bringing back fairness doctrine they say they're coming after us they're run by this foreign
[14:23.680 --> 14:30.400]  globalist soros russia's already kicked him out these are foreign globalists here overthrowing
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.160]  our country so under the constitution these aren't even citizens they don't have the rights
[14:36.160 --> 14:42.480]  they're here overthrowing the system to survive we must go on the offensive we must root them out
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.560]  it's the only way to ever beat them they are criminals they are subversives they are saula
[14:46.560 --> 14:52.480]  linsky pledging to lucifer please continue yeah they want to lynch all of us if not electronically
[14:52.480 --> 14:57.600]  then physically and the fact of the matter is they have names these are not nameless faceless
[14:57.600 --> 15:03.120]  organizations the number one and the worst of them all in my humble opinion is the aclu
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.760]  the anti christian liberties union is the number one they're the head of the snake now the man
[15:07.760 --> 15:13.360]  behind all of it is george soros the most evil man on the planet in my estimation the absolutely
[15:13.360 --> 15:18.000]  most evil person the world has seen in modern times you know you don't have to hang people
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.320]  electrocute them put him in cages you don't have to do the things that isis is doing to be evil
[15:22.320 --> 15:27.280]  he's evil on a larger scale than the isis executioners are because he's gutting the united states of
[15:27.280 --> 15:31.760]  america he's trampling on our constitutions he helped fund the airspring he helped fund the
[15:31.760 --> 15:37.760]  airspring hillary all of them amen and i keep saying she owns it he was the one who who by the
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.200]  way he funded it but you know who was the architect the best i can put together was the big new
[15:43.200 --> 15:48.880]  brzezinski that's right carters national security advisor brzezinski was the architect soros was
[15:48.880 --> 15:54.880]  the financier hillary clinton was the publicist and an actor along with john carry i'd say she
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.760]  was a quarterback with carrie and obama she destroyed the middle east she owns that how
[15:59.760 --> 16:04.240]  does the media forget the media why doesn't trump put her on a cross with that one by the way mr
[16:04.240 --> 16:09.360]  savage under savage that's not hyperbole she literally destabilized 20-something countries
[16:09.360 --> 16:13.760]  that al qaeda and isis are running around hundreds of thousands of dead christians they won't even
[16:13.760 --> 16:18.720]  let christians out of the region it's it these people are demons just like the true liberal
[16:18.720 --> 16:24.080]  assange said look i've got the documents the press is dead if she gets in our nexar and nuises
[16:24.080 --> 16:31.360]  she's a demon you must stop her i hear you and i also saw who wrote the other day that obama the
[16:31.360 --> 16:36.400]  nice slick smooth nice family man has created the greatest surveillance state in the history of the
[16:36.400 --> 16:40.800]  world and suddenly liberals are afraid of it because they understand what happens when the
[16:40.800 --> 16:47.280]  guillotine stops it starts falling first it takes out your opposition but as as the world
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.440]  learned during the french revolution the guillotine has an unlimited taste for blood
[16:51.440 --> 16:56.320]  and it doesn't stop with the enemies of the revolution then they turn on their own kind
[16:56.320 --> 17:00.720]  and start executing their own so so-called counter revolutionaries as was done in the
[17:00.720 --> 17:05.440]  soviet union always happens was done and as was done in cuba as was done in hitlers germany they
[17:05.440 --> 17:10.160]  killed their own the brown shirt and the guillotine keeps falling and cuts heads it is the most
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.800]  thirsty instrument on earth and that's why the left ought to step up and shut their fat mouths

[18:07.760 --> 18:12.720]  why him isn't there a returning combat veteran who worked in military intelligence who would
[18:12.720 --> 18:18.640]  have been a better choice some higher up american citizen patriot somebody like general plan cia

[18:25.680 --> 18:31.200]  no please take over well the way to defeat the enemy is to know your enemy the way to know

[18:51.440 --> 18:56.160]  earth i i studied the cockroaches and i said let's bring them into the light and expose them
[18:56.160 --> 19:01.440]  make them scatter like cockroaches when you turn on the light the request i am making alex jones
[19:01.440 --> 19:08.080]  and to all your listeners is this name subversive organizations as organizations you consider to
[19:08.080 --> 19:13.920]  be so far off the ideal of the american way that they're in fact subversive and what does that mean
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.640]  that means they spend all of their resources going against the wishes of the constitution
[19:18.640 --> 19:25.280]  and the taxpayer so who are they i have a list they're right here who are these organizations
[19:25.280 --> 19:31.360]  trying to conquer us they've done a pretty good job so far they see us as deplorable because
[19:31.360 --> 19:37.760]  we just want to be free national lawyers guild who are they one of the most dangerous activist
[19:37.760 --> 19:44.160]  groups in the nation every time there was a riot by black thugs matter at an anti-police protest
[19:44.160 --> 19:49.680]  the scum in the national lawyers guild sell out sent out they're deranged psychotic lawyers from
[19:49.680 --> 19:55.360]  the worst law schools in america to make sure the police could not do their jobs every last
[19:55.360 --> 20:01.120]  shyster in the national lawyers guild is the type of lawyer that you have come to hate in plain
[20:01.120 --> 20:05.600]  english now of course they will argue that they're just for the underdog that they're there for the
[20:05.600 --> 20:11.920]  poor immigrant and the oppressed minority well you know what i don't buy it i want a lawyers
[20:11.920 --> 20:17.200]  guild for the taxpaying middle class alex not a lawyer's guild for the subversives who are
[20:17.200 --> 20:21.520]  bringing in refugees immigrants whatever you want to call them by the tens of millions and we have
[20:21.520 --> 20:26.320]  the soros emails where he admits us to destabilize the country and he admits destabilization
[20:27.840 --> 20:32.720]  who admitted that george soros in the in the latest dc leaks and others he's in there admitting
[20:32.720 --> 20:38.320]  that it's a plan to overthrow europe in the u.s and create racial strife correct alliance for
[20:38.320 --> 20:44.800]  democracy um amnesty international black lives matter center for american progress center for
[20:44.800 --> 20:49.680]  median democracy i'll read a few of them center for science and the public interest citizens

[21:34.160 --> 21:38.400]  you're absolutely right and they admit they want to collapse us and our borders into a world government
[21:38.400 --> 21:44.720]  dr savage when you say the battle just begins and i say that if trump gets in and i'm not
[21:44.720 --> 21:49.200]  counting our chickens yet i mean uh why do you say the battle just begins we just lost the skype
[21:49.200 --> 21:54.720]  skype is a wondrous thing but it has its issues ladies and gentlemen this is so historical the
[21:54.720 --> 21:57.920]  establishments control the left and the right to bring in globalism but they're making their
[21:57.920 --> 22:03.200]  worldwide takeover with the left and this is not a liberal group liberal means lower taxes more
[22:03.200 --> 22:08.000]  freedom more control locally this is not liberal they call themselves liberal to have the moral
[22:08.000 --> 22:13.200]  high ground the republican establishment is working with them in a big big way the book is
[22:13.200 --> 22:19.040]  scorched earth restoring the country after obama michael savage we're listed supported by you our

[22:41.360 --> 22:45.520]  seller to educate people that are not aware of what's happening because that's michael savage's
[22:45.520 --> 22:49.440]  real skill i found that's something i'm able to do as well most these mainline right wingers can't
[22:49.440 --> 22:53.600]  do it because they're just following a script is that he's able to get leftist a lot of them that
[22:53.600 --> 22:59.680]  mean well out of their cocoon and it and dr. savage continuing with these diverse organizations
[22:59.680 --> 23:03.360]  and then the five six months we have left you promise to come back next week if your voice is
[23:03.360 --> 23:08.240]  announced i really appreciate you to do more and talk about the campaign but hitting some of these
[23:08.240 --> 23:14.400]  other areas her health her cover-up the mainstream media's ratings imploding uh them trying to start
[23:14.400 --> 23:19.680]  all these new wars uh russia i'm not lionizing putin but he's bringing back nationalism he's
[23:19.680 --> 23:24.560]  arrested and thrown out all the sorrows people is subversive i mean just all the crazy things
[23:24.560 --> 23:28.880]  happening it seems there's a quickening do you agree with that and what does this signify
[23:31.040 --> 23:35.440]  what you just said you do you explain it better than i could alex i mean you see the global picture
[23:36.560 --> 23:40.480]  the fact is which one do you want me to talk about anyone you want just i mean the top
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.320]  you talk things about something that in the middle of us talking about and me listing all the
[23:44.320 --> 23:48.640]  subversive organizations that i researched in scorched earth did you notice what happened we
[23:48.640 --> 23:52.800]  lost the connection that my skype dropped did you catch that one it's crazy it's that well they admit
[23:52.800 --> 23:56.800]  google's all game the internet's game they admit they're blocking terms for searching on hillary
[23:56.800 --> 24:01.440]  they admit they're censoring uh patriot grips in europe that criticize open borders it's crazy
[24:02.160 --> 24:07.040]  you mentioned the key word there at google for weeks i've been railing against the monopolies
[24:07.040 --> 24:13.600]  that have emerged in america under obama the dictator google facebook or microsoft of course
[24:13.600 --> 24:19.040]  had been there before look at these companies they're violating the antitrust statutes of the
[24:19.040 --> 24:24.720]  united states legal system there is an antitrust division of the u.s. justice department that
[24:24.720 --> 24:30.800]  does not touch mark zuckerberg does not touch the google boys does not touch bill gates and there's a
[24:30.800 --> 24:36.400]  reason because they all support the globalist new world order agenda they support it to the
[24:36.400 --> 24:42.160]  nth degree and i've been screaming that when trump becomes president he must reactivate
[24:42.160 --> 24:46.800]  and use the justice department to break up these monopolies and give other people a chance
[24:46.800 --> 24:52.880]  to build a business and i make a point of teddy roosevelt who was a populist as you well know
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.400]  and his campaign slogan was bust the trusts the trusts in his day were standard oil
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.920]  rockefeller's railroads and oil company company that dominated railroads and dominated the oil
[25:03.920 --> 25:07.680]  business they didn't give anyone a chance of emerging if they did they crushed and it's the
[25:07.680 --> 25:14.240]  same globalist grandkids today that are running globalism zuckerberg 58 billion dollars isn't
[25:14.240 --> 25:19.600]  enough for that pig he needs to cut the wages of american workers and throw them out of the country
[25:19.600 --> 25:24.480]  and bring in indians will work for one third the wage god bless india god bless their intelligence
[25:24.480 --> 25:29.680]  god bless but we gotta look out for us a little bit they belong in india let them let them rebuild
[25:29.680 --> 25:34.400]  their own economy and let them hire it workers at a right at a right salary so yeah you want to
[25:34.400 --> 25:41.520]  talk about jobs why do you think i'm not you i'm talking about sure why do you think trump is
[25:41.520 --> 25:48.960]  surging amongst the blue collar disenfranchised white male why because they've been dumped upon
[25:48.960 --> 25:55.040]  they've been stepped upon the eddies whose grandfathers defeated hitler the eddies whose fathers
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.560]  died in the jungles of vietnam are being crapped upon by these vermin these cowardly vermin these
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.040]  sick deviant perverts i can't stand it i'll get worked up and i don't want to i'm trying not to
[26:05.040 --> 26:11.040]  alex this is the first interview i've done wow for this book thank you and alex i gotta tell you
[26:11.040 --> 26:13.920]  you're the you're on the front lines you're gonna be around a lot longer than i am in the
[26:13.920 --> 26:20.080]  media and probably on this planet and you're doing the job that needs to be done and all i can
[26:20.080 --> 26:26.720]  say is as the time comes to an end right here when i say that obama and the left are practicing a
[26:26.720 --> 26:32.720]  scorched earth policy there's a reason for it when an army retreated in the past they burnt
[26:32.720 --> 26:37.040]  everything to the ground they burnt the crops they killed a livestock they burned the barns
[26:37.040 --> 26:42.560]  scorched earth is that not what's going on here with this left when they see an ascendant right
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.200]  and ascendant america that's why they're blowing it all up they're burning our they're burning our
[26:47.200 --> 26:53.440]  pathways to survival they're burning our internet they want to burn radio they want to burn any
[26:53.440 --> 26:59.280]  access to war they're saying kill the cops are getting away with everything i keep saying which
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.720]  soros gave them 70 million dollars to those street thugs all we need now is obama to
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.960]  turn them into his well-funded private army he can deputize them and give them government arms
[27:12.960 --> 27:19.040]  as he did isis and then you will have the young pioneers of the sylvia union you will have the
[27:19.040 --> 27:25.200]  red brigades you will have the red brigades of communist china frightening everybody in the
[27:25.200 --> 27:32.800]  society uh on a daily basis alex we're that close to it all coming to that obama is not finished
[27:32.800 --> 27:39.680]  yet he has several months left yet to burn it all down alex i agree we've only got a minute left in
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.880]  your gut you're a smart cookie doctor savage what do you expect them to pull remember what
[27:44.880 --> 27:49.520]  george bush did in the last few months of his regime i was screaming and warning george bush
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.760]  is a fiscal socialist he's not through yes do you remember the housing advice that followed
[27:54.480 --> 28:00.000]  i expect that if it looks like trump is going to win or or grandma falls off the stage again
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.800]  for good and they replace it with uh uh freddy from one of the nightmare movies kane who can't win
[28:04.800 --> 28:12.320]  i i expect the worst i expect them calling off the election i expect martial law i expect if
[28:12.320 --> 28:17.440]  that is not possible i expect a financial complete financial breakdown to create even
[28:17.440 --> 28:22.800]  further chaos that's what i expect i concur with that so every person in very race color and creed
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.960]  that wants to live in a somewhat free country now be involved spread the word expose these people
[28:26.960 --> 28:30.720]  they're all over the news pushing the idea of suspending the election now because of hillary
[28:30.720 --> 28:36.880]  uh the book scorched earth in bookstores all over the country uh michael savage michael savage.com
[28:36.880 --> 28:42.000]  thank you so much for spending so much time with us today we got about 45 seconds final point
[28:43.520 --> 28:49.200]  there is no final point the nation is wrecked right now it's going to be unredeemably destroyed
[28:49.760 --> 28:55.040]  unless the republican candidate wins and i keep saying republican candidate now because if i say
[28:55.040 --> 29:00.160]  the word trump people turn off there are so many anti-trump fake conservatives out there
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.560]  that the many you say trump they go into overdrive so say the republican candidate
[29:04.560 --> 29:07.920]  that makes it a little easier for them to recognize that there is a choice right they're
[29:07.920 --> 29:13.280]  really showing themselves as operatives aren't they oh all the people who hate alex jones and
[29:13.280 --> 29:19.920]  michael savage who are true blue conservatives who are they who are they uh alex we don't even
[29:19.920 --> 29:23.440]  need to say their names because they've destroyed themselves that's the good news they're losing
[29:23.440 --> 29:27.680]  the war they've revealed themselves the fight's now out in the open and and dr. savage my gut
[29:27.680 --> 29:32.560]  tells me we're going to win in the end what do you think well with men like glenn beck
[29:32.560 --> 29:38.080]  rubbing his face in corn flakes it was obviously a very you look at him putting his face in corn
[29:38.080 --> 29:44.400]  flakes the man is obviously a very disturbed individual who was never on on any solid ground
[29:44.960 --> 29:52.000]  and i have said before liberalism is a mental disorder we're on the march the empires on the
[29:52.000 --> 30:02.160]  run alex jones and the gcn radio network well it looks like president elect donald trump is
[30:02.160 --> 30:07.120]  making good on his promises day one of the trump presidency to withdraw from the tpp we have an
[30:07.120 --> 30:11.680]  article it's up on our website info wars dot com and aggregated from cns news it talks about how
[30:11.680 --> 30:15.840]  trump characterized the move a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of quote
[30:15.840 --> 30:20.400]  putting america first of course that's been his credo down with globalism the entire campaign
[30:20.400 --> 30:24.640]  and now that president elect donald trump who said on money that his first day in office next
[30:24.640 --> 30:29.280]  january will be to begin the process of withdrawing from the trans-specific partnership a prospective
[30:29.280 --> 30:33.760]  trade deal which has been the centerpiece of the obama administration he's going to rebalance it
[30:33.760 --> 30:38.880]  now the obama administration wanted to rebalance to asia but trump called that a horrible idea he's
[30:38.880 --> 30:43.360]  saying in an online video message that one of his top priorities in the first 100 days is to ask
[30:43.360 --> 30:48.480]  his transition team to quote develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to restore
[30:48.480 --> 30:53.120]  our laws and bring back our jobs it's about time when he echoes a sentiment that everyday
[30:53.120 --> 30:57.360]  americans feel across this country and it looks like he's making good on his promise i'm margaret

[33:41.360 --> 33:47.440]  this is the essence of authoritarianism the democrats have tried to get travel bans if the irs
[33:47.440 --> 33:53.920]  opens an audit up where you can't travel outside the us they now want to expand it to just flying
[33:53.920 --> 34:00.080]  period these are internal checkpoints the book is scorched earth destroying the country after obama
[34:00.080 --> 34:05.280]  dr sabbage is our guest 20 days ladies and gentlemen to the election dr you got cut off
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.760]  by that hard break i had to take recapping for folks that just joined us and thousands of second
[34:09.760 --> 34:14.960]  are tuning in uh clearly they came out and said we're federalizing elections oh my god the russians
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.520]  and trump want to steal it then trump goes i think you'll try to rig it democrats are famous for that
[34:19.520 --> 34:24.880]  they've now been caught in new york already doing it an early voting they respond going you're insane
[34:26.240 --> 34:31.600]  election fraud doesn't exist i mean that's an exact quote of obama so i'm living in this crazy
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.320]  world where they're federalizing the elections first time ever taking them over because of an
[34:36.320 --> 34:41.440]  unprecedented threat when trump says you might try to steal it they go you're insane it doesn't exist
[34:41.440 --> 34:46.880]  so so dr sabbage you talked to him yesterday on air what do you think's happening i said
[34:46.880 --> 34:51.040]  that donald here's what they're doing is setting it up as follows for three four months they've
[34:51.040 --> 34:55.440]  been saying the russians are hacking our elections they're saying to protect our elections which is
[34:55.440 --> 35:00.640]  sacred we want to turn it over to dhs the genius who's given us one terrorist attack after another
[35:00.640 --> 35:05.440]  and has done nothing to stop it he still has his job right so he wants to now make sure our elections
[35:05.440 --> 35:12.080]  are safe russians are hacking follow the bouncing ball no proof if if trump wins which is highly
[35:12.080 --> 35:17.840]  likely by the way which we can talk about in a minute or two or another time trump wins government
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.760]  declares oh we have evidence that the russians hacked it he's a friend of putin the election
[35:23.760 --> 35:29.280]  is null and void we're going to recall another election in what six months until then mr obama
[35:29.280 --> 35:35.840]  has graciously agreed to continue his public service in the united states of america thank
[35:35.840 --> 35:41.360]  you very much we're not taking any questions goodbye and we have biden announcing they're
[35:41.360 --> 35:45.120]  going to launch a giant cyber attack on the russians and saying the russians respond they may
[35:45.120 --> 35:50.240]  respond militarily which is a doctrine hillary came out with two months ago and suddenly nato
[35:50.240 --> 35:56.080]  announced that's their new doctrine she's literally calling the show all i wanted to say was i said
[35:56.080 --> 35:59.680]  it to donald and he didn't take the bait i'm glad he didn't i said don't even answer me because
[35:59.680 --> 36:05.360]  they'll crucify you if you agree with me they're going to steal the election just to yeah i'll
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.880]  make it simple in the fifth grade i ran for class president in queens new york i was a funny kid i
[36:10.880 --> 36:16.480]  was a wild kid i was out of control i won the election by a landslide the teacher stood up and
[36:16.480 --> 36:23.600]  said this election doesn't count i don't want michael to be president she had another election
[36:23.600 --> 36:27.920]  and i wasn't class president so hey look if it could be done in the fifth grade in the Bronx
[36:27.920 --> 36:32.800]  when i was a kid why can't they do it to us now right which is children i had a similar thing
[36:32.800 --> 36:36.720]  happen it you know when you really do things in this world you start to learn how rigged they are
[36:36.720 --> 36:41.360]  and it's just crazy to see them go even though it's not the same newscast the russians are
[36:41.360 --> 36:45.120]  rigging the election we're having to bring in the u n to oversee it and then meanwhile
[36:45.120 --> 36:49.360]  trumps crazy he says they're rigging the election even as we catch election officials in men with
[36:49.360 --> 36:53.280]  fraud we do have a minute or two more if you've got it elaborate on what you're saying i mean i agree
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.120]  the internal polls i know from trump but also other big groups are doing internal polls five
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.680]  10 15 points ahead in most battleground states he's gonna win a landslide they're only creating
[37:01.680 --> 37:06.960]  a perception he's way behind so we buy it right now do you concur with that a b what happens when
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.880]  he gets in hundred percent right you and i think the same way i said that donald yesterday on my
[37:10.880 --> 37:17.760]  radio show i said uh donald i said what they're doing is they're not trying to get hillary people
[37:17.760 --> 37:22.000]  people vote for hillary they've got all the people they could ever ever get i said what they're trying
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.960]  to do is discourage trump voters from voting by thinking that it's it's over already they're
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.200]  trying to make them think that he lost that she won so they're gonna throw their hands up and not
[37:31.200 --> 37:38.000]  vote for him i said this whole election hinges upon one thing right now voter turnout the black
[37:38.000 --> 37:43.520]  people are not turning out for hillary they don't like her the hispanic people are really not that
[37:43.520 --> 37:49.200]  excited about hillary he has no crowds and it's the hispanic men have always liked trump as i said
[37:49.200 --> 37:53.760]  six months ago for a number of reasons one most of them coming to work very hard to become an
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.760]  american they have the wives and the children they want a house with a picket friend so they
[37:57.760 --> 38:01.760]  look at donald trump as a man they'd like to be like not a man they hate they look at her and they
[38:01.760 --> 38:08.720]  say oh whatever so it's all voter turnout he's got to make sure that people think he can still win
[38:08.720 --> 38:15.520]  which he can and then if all of us who are supporting him come out i think he will win it's
[38:15.520 --> 38:20.320]  that simple that's right you can't steal landslides i've interviewed experts or democrats republicans
[38:20.320 --> 38:25.680]  die bold engineers from the highest levels they agree you cannot steal a landslide because it is
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.000]  cobbled together how the systems work and and the battleground states are key will be obviously
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.480]  listening to the savage nation with michael savage that comes on just a few hours and will

[39:58.960 --> 40:06.960]  it's in all the wiki leaks they say their philosophy is making us poor to control us
[40:06.960 --> 40:14.000]  that's called slavery people i'm anti-slavery and i'm angry and we're in a crisis
[40:17.440 --> 40:20.880]  and i just look at these criminals on tv laughing at us all the people that wrote obama

[42:23.200 --> 42:30.480]  you to this point of having to do this sir well i feel like it's my moral obligation as a concerned
[42:30.480 --> 42:39.440]  citizen as a taxpayer um having seen what went on with their administration how this woman has
[42:39.440 --> 42:45.680]  had on every side of the issue and still can sit there and tell us you know what she wants us to
[42:45.680 --> 42:54.000]  believe and it did it just came to a point where i i was courted by tom barley um for quite some time
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.920]  to come forward and i hadn't but tom barley sort of broke the story open on his show and it just
[42:59.920 --> 43:05.440]  sort of went from there wow well again being one of their executive chefs worldwide and other world
[43:05.440 --> 43:11.280]  leaders for many many years and you know obviously uh i mean close to them specifically uh why are you
[43:11.280 --> 43:16.080]  going public what did you witness hillary clinton do i had former secret service agent burns on
[43:16.080 --> 43:22.240]  yesterday who said that he saw and heard disparaging marks towards hispanics by her but but he wanted to
[43:22.240 --> 43:27.440]  say she was mean and nasty to everyone including hitting secret service agents the back of that
[43:27.440 --> 43:34.640]  with bibles and things describe what you witnessed sir well what well first of all with mrs clinton
[43:34.640 --> 43:42.000]  and if you know i got but what i used to say when i could talk when i couldn't talk is that you
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.320]  know no matter where we went she'd come in she'd be grateful say thanks thank you to the
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.000]  the back of the house people in the kitchen etc but that was always if there was press around
[43:52.800 --> 43:58.080]  she's a completely different person when the camera's not on her and i ran into an incident
[43:58.080 --> 44:04.800]  i was at the elizabeth taylor medical center in washington dc and we were doing a tea with mrs
[44:04.800 --> 44:12.320]  surek the former french president's voice and it was just mrs clinton mrs surek and myself
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.720]  in the same room and one of the people brought in something and it did not please her and she
[44:18.720 --> 44:27.760]  used the n word very openly to me and and i think that's that's a general pattern when they
[44:27.760 --> 44:35.120]  talk like that that's not like they say it just um you know out of the clear blue again
[44:35.120 --> 44:40.560]  former top chef to the clinton's uh mr martin can you walk through specifically what was happening
[44:40.560 --> 44:47.440]  the conversation what was said well what had happened with the conversation is i was i was
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.400]  just like i said mrs surek mrs clinton and myself in there i was just serving them to
[44:52.400 --> 44:58.080]  me as a travel chef i was i i would did not do stuff in the white house i did stuff outside
[44:58.080 --> 45:04.480]  of the white house and we went places you were the travel chef continue so she brought we had
[45:04.480 --> 45:08.400]  somebody bring in something i think it was like some teeth sandwiches or whatever and it wasn't
[45:08.400 --> 45:16.160]  exactly what she wanted so she tells me to tell that n n word to please you know they even get
[45:16.160 --> 45:26.960]  what she wants i mean that's very common i mean just the demeanor and you know and you know she
[45:26.960 --> 45:32.960]  would write things down like that to you know she has so many handlers and when i work when i work
[45:32.960 --> 45:40.560]  for them in washington i used to think to myself you know because the parties aside i thought you
[45:40.560 --> 45:45.280]  know this is great i'm a kid that grew up on a small farm and should talk with county and and
[45:45.280 --> 45:50.880]  here i am working for the three leader of the world so you sort of out you know you don't
[45:50.880 --> 45:55.840]  look at this other small stuff and then one day you realize you know they're really terrible people
[45:59.040 --> 46:06.080]  well so just be clear tracy martin he's going to do us any better i mean she tells us one thing
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.280]  she does something totally opposite and now with all the wiki leaks information coming out
[46:11.280 --> 46:16.640]  yet everything that i've said for the last few years is all proven just like don trump has said
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.280]  it's all coming out so you've you've you last few years talked to folks about this but now
[46:21.280 --> 46:25.200]  you're starting to go on air because it's being backed up by the wiki leaks now again the executive
[46:25.200 --> 46:30.560]  chef when they were worldwide travel tracy martin joins us he's on record uh you know uh doing these
[46:30.560 --> 46:36.160]  events for years and other presidents have just tuned in please elaborate or did i hear you wrong
[46:36.160 --> 46:42.160]  did you say that she even did handwritten letters sometimes saying inward this inward that i mean
[46:42.160 --> 46:48.240]  did i hear you say that that is definitely correct please elaborate sir well you know if
[46:48.240 --> 46:53.520]  if you know a lot of times because they have so many handlers and everything they just scratch
[46:53.520 --> 46:57.680]  things down the paper just because you need to be quiet there's a lot of people around
[46:57.680 --> 47:01.600]  just take care of this now that's what lawyers do she's a lawyer so she's writing notes handing
[47:01.600 --> 47:10.960]  them to you what she write what she i mean without you know like tell that i mean inward that you
[47:10.960 --> 47:16.080]  know that i don't need them or to go out or you know whatever or that you know she could say that
[47:16.080 --> 47:23.280]  bitch over there or whatever i mean when you'd want to say that you well that's what i've talked
[47:23.280 --> 47:27.920]  to secret service and others they say she goes out of her way to attack everyone and if it's
[47:27.920 --> 47:34.080]  hispanic it'd be a spanish proga you know a slang term disparaging term it's black person white
[47:34.080 --> 47:39.520]  person they'll do it it's a woman it's a bitch if it's a man it's a what other type of things
[47:39.520 --> 47:45.760]  is she write or say to you over the years which i think in general it's just her her condescending
[47:45.760 --> 47:53.040]  attitude because the clintons no matter what they are a machine they made no they're not a couple
[47:53.040 --> 48:00.800]  when they when they was running for office he said we are in a partnership all it is is a money
[48:00.800 --> 48:06.960]  machine it has been that way since the day one and it's still that way 30 years later
[48:06.960 --> 48:10.960]  well i've talked to secret service agents on off the record and they say it's like she doesn't have
[48:10.960 --> 48:15.280]  a real personality because either this fake one that's very charming or this crazy hateful one
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.200]  but i've talked to other military people and i brought up to secret service and how do you know
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.360]  that and they didn't want me to even go there because it sounds so nuts they think if they'll
[48:23.360 --> 48:27.760]  just you'll be discrediting but i'll just say it they say hillary almost like switches off
[48:27.760 --> 48:34.320]  she'll go i'm going to rest now and just go and and it was almost like you know don't forget
[48:34.320 --> 48:41.760]  you're working for the clintons that type of an attitude you know no matter what no matter where
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.000]  it was always about the clintons and and like i said in tom barley's interview you know they
[48:48.000 --> 48:54.000]  they just for an example they have a they bought that house and they left the the government in
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.120]  chapaqua they have a secret service booth they are billing the u.s. government rent for that
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.920]  secret service booth which in turn is paying for their mortgage the same thing with her
[49:03.920 --> 49:10.720]  large home in washington dc we as a government are paying for their mortgages now specifically
[49:10.720 --> 49:18.480]  an initiative which is the global initiative which is just a money machine for them tracy martin
[49:18.480 --> 49:25.120]  executive chef when they traveled for many years uh were there ever any other cases where she
[49:25.120 --> 49:30.000]  verbally said go tell that in word to do this or that because you were saying many times she would
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.840]  write it was it many times writing it and just once verbally or there ever any other racial
[49:33.840 --> 49:39.760]  slurs you heard her say no i think verbally i mean like with hispanics with anybody i mean
[49:39.760 --> 49:47.040]  it's just it's it's they are so that that sense of self entitlement and so far above everybody
[49:47.040 --> 49:51.840]  else so that's the secret service that they said it almost wasn't even like it was a race it was

[54:32.080 --> 54:37.040]  a big news making interview paul watson has an interview up on info wars dot com breaking down
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.880]  tracy martin the fact that he did work for the clintons as their travel chef and is at work for
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.600]  other world leaders has a lot of courage to do this and to come out but this is what everyone
[54:47.600 --> 54:53.040]  tells me you don't look her in the eyes she screams and yells she doesn't give tips she treats people
[54:53.040 --> 54:58.640]  terribly uh when she sees a person in a wheelchair she says get that gd cripple away from me uh when
[54:58.640 --> 55:03.440]  people bring dogs in to search her room you know she just always screams at the military i mean
[55:04.160 --> 55:08.400]  she goes out of her way to be a demon but if the cameras are around she's totally loving but the
[55:08.400 --> 55:13.040]  minute the camera turns off it's like she's got to balance it out by being nasty it's like she's
[55:13.040 --> 55:20.400]  got multiple personalities tracy martin absolutely well you've got the floor i mean you were getting
[55:20.400 --> 55:24.880]  cut off by the break you were just getting into the effects basically mirroring what what what
[55:24.880 --> 55:29.680]  mr burns the secret service agent said yesterday was just that she just hated everybody but
[55:29.680 --> 55:37.040]  did use the racial pejoratives well i like i said i think the clintons that she especially
[55:37.040 --> 55:43.200]  has a sense of self entitlement she is above and beyond i mean her true beliefs i think
[55:43.200 --> 55:50.480]  is she's above and beyond everyone she has no i mean she takes no solace and who she talks about
[55:50.480 --> 55:55.840]  who she talks to i mean i've seen secret service trying to protect her in the way she downgrades
[55:55.840 --> 56:02.320]  her conversations to them i i mean to people have anybody you mean she talks to him like
[56:02.320 --> 56:05.840]  they're just her for everything she talks to them like their children's what you're saying
[56:07.040 --> 56:12.960]  pardon me when you say downgrades conversation what do you mean well like she she downgrades
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.440]  them i mean because you know like oh she puts them down give us an example i know you're
[56:17.440 --> 56:20.880]  wanting to be polite here but your guy that puts on you know world famous dinners and
[56:20.880 --> 56:26.880]  you're all about decor but decorum i mean just give us an example i think we're like the secret
[56:26.880 --> 56:33.760]  service i mean you know she just like i demand the demanding attitude uh you know we're all
[56:33.760 --> 56:40.080]  supposed to be subservient to them they are they're they're the only people that count ever even if
[56:40.080 --> 56:46.080]  we were in a in a like for example this event with mrs charak i mean it was like we'd have to wait
[56:46.080 --> 56:50.800]  for mrs clinton because you know god's a bit of shoes to wait for anybody else
[56:52.640 --> 56:57.360]  you know obama's done evil stuff obama's done evil stuff that way and i was i was involved
[56:58.160 --> 57:03.840]  my end of my term with them was when the whole monica thing broke loose and i mean just to
[57:03.840 --> 57:09.200]  see how they would i mean they would show up in church every sunday high and mighty and
[57:09.200 --> 57:14.880]  here we go because that's the way it was i mean they cannot do they believe they do no wrong
[57:14.880 --> 57:18.640]  anywhere well i was about to say i'm not defending obama for his record but secret service people
[57:18.640 --> 57:23.440]  say he's real nice and person comparatively and that's like a few weeks ago in televieve he's like
[57:23.440 --> 57:28.720]  for 20 minutes bill's making him wait he finally goes bill get on the plane and it's like they're
[57:28.720 --> 57:35.200]  so entitled what i've heard they just think they're god basically absolutely absolutely
[57:35.200 --> 57:41.600]  within no matter what i mean we were doing an event out at hickory hill and mrs robert kennedy's
[57:42.160 --> 57:48.000]  this is after i was done with the clinton's and we were doing i believe it was an uh an
[57:48.000 --> 57:54.160]  Easter brunch and and you know there again you're waiting for them you know and it's you know when
[57:54.160 --> 57:58.000]  you're at that position in the world you can pretty much get away with whatever you want
[57:59.920 --> 58:03.120]  but they enjoy it they do it on purpose is what i'm told we're getting a clear picture of their
[58:03.120 --> 58:07.040]  psychology and i'm going to get a top psychiatrist to listen to this and analyze with other interviews
[58:07.040 --> 58:10.080]  we're going to break that five more minutes with you sir i'd like to have you back up soon

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:38.880]  burns yesterday um i've talked to secret service on and off record i've had a lot of people the
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.320]  reason i bring up the smell is it's part of psychological research psychopaths sociopaths and
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.840]  others tend to not clean themselves especially when they get a position of power and it's just all
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.200]  part of you know being the boss and i'm not going to get into some of the other things they do but
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.160]  it just goes to their mindset we got four minutes i appreciate your time you've got the floor you're

[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.760]  nothing you're just here telling the truth and so other points you like to relay to the world about
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:15.600]  why you're going public let's see um as i said in my Tom Barley's the original interview um i
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:23.040]  i feel it's my obligation because you know i said in the back pictures silent for so long
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:29.600]  and i did pay them compliments i mean like i said i was a kid from a small farm town i found myself
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.280]  working in washington dc i'm now doing events with the leader of the free world and then just
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:42.160]  find out how they really are behind scenes how they i mean between yeah i just happened to you
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.160]  know end up working for the cleanser you know it could have been you know the obama there's
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:54.800]  somebody else down the road but you just see the the total transparency of this is not the complete
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:01.440]  picture and i feel like i the american people need to know who she really is who he the president
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.600]  really is if we get her back in office we're dealing with a whole nother obama term we're
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.480]  dealing with a whole nother bill clinton scenario he's he's gonna have him doing just as much as he
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:21.280]  was before and she's failed at so many things and i've seen i've seen that with my own eyes
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:27.040]  i mean back when she was doing the access to health care and you know that just as you know
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.840]  it's it is what it is and we as people need to stop i mean we're going to see your country fall
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.960]  we'll see that's their philosophy though we're at that point right now i agree they want each
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.680]  new initiative to fail to then give them more power because they never get held accountable see
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:51.520]  the wickley show she wants it all to fail brother how diabolical is that no that's that's why i mean
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.640]  it's it's unbelievable and that stuff is all true i mean it's not like they passed in and wrote it
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:02.080]  and i i meant i mean now they're confirming the fbi the new fbi leak the new fbi release
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.840]  shows that it's it's it's all confirmed trying to bribe the fbi getting orders from some weird
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:12.320]  shadow government i mean god help us that's why they picked her though because she's such a monster
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.640]  she enjoys hurting little people she wants to make us poor absolutely you can't tell me that bill
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:26.800]  Clinton arriving on tarmac when the attorney general's sitting there that was just a coincidence well

[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.600]  uh and uh the uh you know utopia dystopia film about communism boy all that's coming out i want to get
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.760]  into what happened with bill clinton's who i believe ill jenemite son they're really trying to
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.600]  cover that up but first i want to talk to him about wiki leaks does this not prove everything
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:19.840]  joe gilbert from joelgilbert.net has broken down the shadow government running them the trying to
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.240]  bribe fbi agents knowing they were destroying classified documents and and hiding them i mean
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:32.400]  this is incredible to watch the media try to unify even more to prop her up even if they steal
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:38.880]  the election where she gets in these are political deathblows joelgilbert i mean no wonder they say
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.560]  they openly want to shut down the alt right and demonize me by name because they are just floundering
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:52.640]  in my view what do you think i think uh look they're clearly floundering they clearly put together
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:58.880]  this assault on donald trump uh week by week knowing that they could probably get their media
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:05.920]  minions to only focus on trump and give them an excuse to completely ignore these bombshell
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:12.320]  revelations uh the biggest one which i think really tells the whole story is that hillary
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:18.080]  explicitly said that there is a public policy for everything and a private policy for everything
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:26.240]  and nothing more is illustrated uh even greater than in the story of of danie williams because
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.920]  she speaks affectionately for black lives matter but in her that's her public life in her private
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:38.560]  life she banished her husband's uh child her own stepson from her family and so we know that when
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.720]  hillary says uh black lives matter uh and she feels for them she's really thinking black
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:50.400]  votes matter and like everything else exactly you said this five six years ago that she's a sociopath
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.320]  only goes off polls and who is she because it's almost like she has multiple personalities you've
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.440]  talked to a lot of experts you've been on the trail joker who is she really what is her psychological
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:08.000]  profile her psychological profile is that she really is a chicago radical in just like uh barack
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.880]  obama she had a bill ares figure in her life which was carl oglesby the head of the sds she read his
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:21.120]  book uh containment and change and was pen pals with saula linsky not only pen pals she met saula
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:26.640]  linsky he offered her a job uh she said that uh rather than work for him on the outside she wants
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:33.520]  to affect change from the inside her uh thesis of her college thesis was about saula linsky while
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.400]  becoming a filthy rich pig that steals money from Haitian children right there can only be one fight
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:45.200]  so she is at her core a uh a 60s radical she also had a reverend right in her life she had a radical
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:51.280]  minister named john don jones her methodist youth minister that introduced her to linsky so she has
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:17:01.280]  a similar background in terms of radical theologian radical uh communist sds uh ideologue way back just
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:05.840]  like obama had his bill ares i totally agree so 20 days out what do you expect him to do next
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.840]  this huge elaborate attack most of the women has turned out we're hitting on him asking him to come
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.360]  visit him uh in emails even this year it's all uh deteriorating they they conducted over a thousand
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.160]  women found nine of them to say touch their butter touch their knee or whatever shook their hand okay
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:27.680]  he's evil uh what comes next hillary's entire campaign is simply i think to uh drug her up
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:33.280]  to get her physically across the finish line and simply focus on that donald trump is a creepy guy
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:39.520]  she has no the way he walks around on the stage menacing her the poor baby there's no
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:44.640]  policy there's no justification to have hillary clinton back in the white house she has no policy
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.840]  of barack obama that she participated in that was successful everything was a dismal failure
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:58.400]  all she can do is try to keep power in the democrat party and try to impose this era this coming era
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:05.120]  of liberal fascism which i have no doubt she will uh implement through supreme radical supreme court
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.640]  justices who will defy the constitutional law and impose and create their own laws of limiting
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.920]  so trump says this is making her break at the end of america if he doesn't get in i mean barring
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:21.040]  physical resistance this is probably it i believe this is it because once she changes the supreme
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:27.200]  court justice to radical leftist nominees once she adds a seventh commissioner to the fec to
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:34.320]  break the ties uh all of those uh policies we've seen obama uh doing behind the scenes
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.720]  will just come out that's right let's be clear the federal election commission and the FCC they're
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:43.360]  deadlocked are on record that if they get a majority they're going to ban free speech they admit it
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:51.280]  oh you remember my case uh they voted three to three uh it cut down a a complaint to investigate
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.080]  me for making the film about obama's yeah that's how real this is is they're trying to shut you up
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:02.400]  a filmmaker they've arrested denisha susan good god yeah three to three now how could it be three
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.880]  to three it should be six to nothing that they should not be investigating a filmmaker for making
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:11.440]  a film about obama's background i presented a mountain of evidence that his real father
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:16.800]  was the soviet agent frank marshall davis who raised and radicalized him in his youth uh the
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:21.200]  he wrote about in his own book spending summers with frank is dead his grandfather's best friend
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.680]  it's hiding in plain view well it wasn't just summers it was every day he went to frank's house
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:30.560]  frank uh radicalized him into this uh anti-american anti-white how do they square this though that
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.640]  they make hundreds of millions of dollars in office they live the most lavish lifestyle of kings
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.280]  they don't want poor people to have money but then they prance around saying they're communist
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:44.800]  well that is the fraud uh the total fraud of socialism and communism that what we have is a
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:50.560]  new class of elites they eliminate the entrepreneurial class the so-called bourgeois they want to
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:56.320]  destroy the drug companies wall street the banks all the businesses the business of america is
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.360]  business but they want to destroy business and consolidate wealth and power in their own hands
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:07.280]  leaving a large middle class to be eliminated so we only have a lower class socialist economies
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:11.520]  don't have a middle class they have an upper class elites and they have the poor people
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:16.720]  and these are the upper class elites that are accumulating the wealth by destroying the people
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.240]  that make uh by the way history with hundreds of countries is incontrovertible that socialism
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:27.120]  and communism creates nightmare hells even small free market experiments that never even get 10
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.720]  percent there create fabulous development fabulous innovation fabulous civilization
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:39.680]  progressives murdered 150 million of their own people during peacetime as we saw in my film
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:45.040]  there's no place like utopia because they wouldn't fit into the perfect society the perfect world
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:51.520]  they didn't agree that they would uh conform in cambodia they murdered anybody that had glasses
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.400]  because if you had glasses you could read and they wanted to recreate humanity oh i have the
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:01.600]  zeitgeist movement admittedly supported by the un and the new york times tell me on air you will
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.240]  be reeducated if you don't accept a computer deciding what job you have or where you live
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.880]  i go that's total tyranny and i just arrogantly go we're gonna run your life we're liberal well
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:17.360]  no that's not liberal that's called total totalitarianism dumbass i call it uh liberal fascism if you
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.080]  don't conform this is what happens throughout history you get sent to the gulag you get sent
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:29.520]  for reeducation or you're simply eliminated uh this is a totalitarian depressing uh lifestyle
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:35.760]  to have a group of elites with all the wealth the elites are uh in socialism and communism
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.960]  are state bureaucrats who don't produce anything therefore you have a society that becomes impoverished
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:46.480]  today we have with a free market system we have the entrepreneur class creating jobs and creating
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:53.600]  wealth and everybody moving up uh unfortunately it seems that younger people millennials don't
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.160]  know these lessons of communism and so no they say to me oh my god england again that's great
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.600]  health care was that why it's rated horrible people come here even those ours is all corrupt and
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:06.480]  bad now i mean you know they think you have no they think north korea is great i mean it's crazy
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.800]  they they've we've lost this lesson in history in the 60s they mobilized all of hollywood the
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.400]  government would educate people put out films and show that look if if you look at maltze tong
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:26.720]  stall in all these countries cuba it's political repression and poverty and and death and we have
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:31.600]  not had that type of education so you have people going to bernie sanders rallies sanders is just
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.080]  an old school communist and they're clapping for everything he says we're going to go after wall
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:40.240]  street we're going to destroy the banks we're going to break up the pharmaceutical companies
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:44.000]  well if you break up business you end up being venezuela or you end up being
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:48.960]  communist russia where sure sure but let's have the final piece if you look read carol quickley's
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.880]  book or others they admit this there's an ultra rich elite they want to get rid of the middle
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:56.720]  class to create a consolidation so there's ultra corporations that are working with a socialist
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:02.400]  and communist to cut out the middleman and then cut out competition and then they plan to double
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:07.520]  cross the communist and set up a technocracy fascism but i agree with you when you've said
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:12.080]  the communist plan to double cross the corporations and create a new dark age so i don't know what's
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:17.840]  worse a technocracy fascism or a dark age i mean it's just crazy we just need to stick with our
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:23.040]  constitutional republic exactly and and not follow these people that have a passion for
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.600]  destruction well how is it not liberal to have true diversity of business and life and ideas
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.720]  and not have thought control that's real liberalism look at in their mind we've talked about this
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.200]  before they look at america differently the conservatives we look at the world and we say
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:43.360]  america is the greatest democratic constitutional republic in the history of mankind uh let the
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.960]  left looks at america and compares it to a perfect utopia and says it doesn't measure up therefore
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:55.120]  we have to destroy it so we can rebuild the perfect world and that is the fallacy of progressivism
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.400]  and that's why it costs so much and all they ever build is nightmare and hells that kill everybody
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:03.760]  so i've been asking some of the questions we got six minutes left joel gilbert getting into uh the
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:08.480]  the the son of bill clinton clearly is the son of bill clinton the whole background on that you've
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:12.080]  done comparisons on their faces and suppose we could show some of that writing for world net
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.720]  daily uh you helped put together the first film with that uh i don't free of charge we appreciate
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:21.600]  you being so dedicated to this out in la when he flew out there uh let's spend five minutes on
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.440]  danie williams yeah i've been following this for 10 12 years and always been fascinated by it
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.120]  and uh there's just no question in my mind that uh you know danie you know is the son of bill
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.560]  clinton uh there's not anybody in the world that looks like him whose mother has been telling him
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.080]  since he was five years old that bill was his father and who lives in little rock uh he looks a
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:50.800]  lot like skull skull shapes very similar well look at the teeth uh the teeth are a match uh i've had
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.120]  dentists tell me like with frank marshall davis and barack obama exact teeth now it isn't especially
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:00.080]  the top teeth him yeah the top teeth ears nose i mean it reminds me the interview i did with malik
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.840]  obama for example he's got hazel eyes if you cross blue with brown that's what you get it's a it's a
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.240]  really a complete match and he has actually this the thing he inherited from his dad is he does have
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:17.040]  this intangible likeability factor he really does have a personality he's a great kid and he talks
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:23.280]  about how when he was five years old his aunt took him you know they were on uh some kind of welfare
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.200]  they needed some child support they went to the governor's mansion his aunt snuck in the gate
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.720]  when the gates opened knocked on the door asked for hillary and they slammed the door in her face
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:38.240]  and they ran off jumped over a fence and were later paid some hush money seven hundred dollars a month
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:44.480]  along with some christmas presents uh it's a very sad story and i think uh anybody in urban america
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:48.960]  that's thinking of voting for hillary really wants should look at this because danny talks about how
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:56.080]  it's the same as back in slave times when uh a slave owner would have a child with a slave
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:02.000]  and the the wife of the plantation owner would run him off the plantation and banishes the child
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  and uh that's essentially what happened to danny he was in foster homes when his father
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  was president of the united states he was in foster homes he said going to bed hungry at night
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.480]  can you imagine that i can't even imagine it's incredible i had tracy martin the admitted
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.560]  chef of the clinton's their travel chef for five of the eight years or whatever he worked for the
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:26.000]  bushes as well uh he was just saying it was constant racial notes she write notes get this
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.320]  inward to get me some food or she would verbally say it attacking his panics and everybody i know
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:36.400]  about the clinton's say she they're just flaming racist or just whatever is nasty to say uh i think
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.960]  this is a pretty big story as well i i think it's huge look the democrat not bell i want to be clear
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.280]  it's hillary that says the race stuff well let's talk about public and private democrats oppose
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:49.360]  the civil rights movement they broke up black families with a welfare system they forced them
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.960]  into terrible schools uh or they turned urban america into drug culture single mothers violent
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:00.720]  neighborhoods and they keep going back asking for their votes on a personal level you can see
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.400]  what they do to their own family uh malik obama was discarded all the kenyan obamas i did an interview
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:13.680]  with him they were discarded by barack obama because they no longer needed them uh danny williams was
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:20.240]  i think discarded and denied by the clinton's because uh they don't need him and i think uh
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.800]  is a very sad story and just incredible that uh hillary clinton essentially banished him from
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.360]  their lives when in fact he's a great kid and they'd be they do good to embrace him so i hope
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:37.200]  they know i interviewed his hand uh like 19 years ago i mean this this is going on i talked to the
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:41.520]  to the state police that were just appalled by it all in closing at about two and a half minutes
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:46.640]  jelgelbert jelgelbert.net folks want to find us films we sell them as well in forwardstore.com
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.600]  but regardless just get a lot of people that aren't awake what do you and your gut think
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:57.200]  they're going to pull the next 20 days where do you think all this is going i think they're
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:04.400]  going to try to keep uh hammering uh keep a focus on donald's alleged indiscretions that
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:11.040]  is he a creepy guy or is he not he's racist uh he talks poorly about african americans
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.600]  all these exaggerations and inferences that they make from anything he ever did or said
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.920]  10 20 30 years ago it's all coordinated with the media and uh i think i'm hoping and thinking that
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:25.680]  people are going to be immune to it at some point they're going to be sick of it
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:29.920]  because this reminds us of what we went through with the clintons you know 20 years ago
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:36.880]  where there was this constant uh clinton pushing these narratives that were twisted and and lies
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:42.320]  and half truths and i think it's actually reminding people of how how annoying and disgusting the
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.520]  clinton president he was exactly if we take billy bush he now admits that was like an hour long
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:52.160]  conversation and then he was goading and clearly they were setting trump up and it's all edited
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.240]  i mean i could record you for an hour ask you questions on a road trip you might say something
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.000]  i mean now that i think about these tapes i catch myself and i'm out hiking with buddies or whatever
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.600]  i'm not even really a nasty guy i'm not really you know what i see is kind of you know shocking
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.840]  but i catch myself you know saying some things i wouldn't want out there and it's like my god
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.000]  this is the type of stuff that's going on i mean this woman's running isis this woman is
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.840]  doing all this horrible stuff and we're obsessed over some 11 year old tape well i think that's
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:21.120]  the strategy is to only focus on trump because there's no justification for electing hillary
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:26.240]  to city council let alone president united states she she doesn't she does not qualify for security
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.080]  clearance everything she's touched turned into a disaster and now we know she tried to bribe the
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.200]  fbi joe gilbert thank you powerful information great job on the whole situation with dandy
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.960]  williams we're going to come back we're going to get joe biggs and michael Zimmerman here they
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:46.080]  went to haiti for a week with mr haven and this is so bombshell i don't even know how to handle i mean
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:53.520]  this should destroy the clinton this is incredible we're on the march the empires on the run alex
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:30:02.240]  jones and the gcn radio network well it looks like president elect donald trump is making
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.360]  good on his promises day one of the trump presidency to withdraw from the tpp we have an article it's
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:12.480]  up on our website info wars dot com and aggregated from cns news it talks about how trump characterized
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:16.960]  the move a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of quote putting america first of
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.440]  course that's been his credo down with globalism the entire campaign and now that president elect
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:26.320]  donald trump who set on money that his first day in office next january will be to begin the process
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.320]  of withdrawing from the trans-specific partnership a prospective trade deal which has been the center
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:34.640]  piece of the obama administration he's going to rebalance it now the obama administration
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.760]  wanted to rebalance to asia but trump called that a horrible idea he's saying in an online video
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:44.160]  message that one of his top priorities in the first 100 days is to ask his transition team to
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:49.440]  quote develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to restore our laws and bring back
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.720]  our jobs it's about time we echoes a sentiment that everyday americans feel across this country
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:58.800]  and it looks like he's making good on his promise i'm margaret howell reporting for info wars dot

[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:17.360]  it's wednesday october 12th 2016 only 26 days left in the final countdown election 2016 americanism
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:24.000]  versus globalism you're listening to the alex jones show broadcasting from austin texas worldwide
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.560]  while the media distracted you with an 11 year old tape of donald trump's locker room banter wiki
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:41.120]  leaks dropped bombshell after bombshell and the clinton mouthpiece media have barely even reported
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:46.800]  on it in one email sent by hillary surrogate bill ivy to clinton campaign manager john pedestrian
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:52.640]  ivy braggs about how the left has sought to maintain political power by producing quote an
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:59.040]  unaware and compliant citizenry this is beyond arrogant elitism it sounds like something out
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:06.400]  of they live the gains have been substantial both for ourselves and for you the human power
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:13.680]  elite we've all been quite content to demean government drop civics and in general conspire
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:20.880]  to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry conspire conspire to produce an uninformed mass
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:25.760]  who will just do as they're told the unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:31.920]  fading rapidly this problem demands some serious serious thinking and not just poll driven demographically
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:38.400]  inspired messaging to emphasize ivy admits that the left has conspired to produce an unaware and
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:44.720]  compliant citizenry but that they're not as easy to manipulate anymore and that this is a problem
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:51.440]  he characterizes unawareness amongst the public as a positive thing for the clinton campaign so we're
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:58.880]  supposed to be outraged about trump's locker room banter from 2005 yet here we have a clinton surrogate
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:05.840]  calling the entire population of america dumb and conspiring with the clinton campaign to keep it
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:12.400]  that way and there's no outrage whatsoever there's not even any media coverage of it absolutely nothing
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:18.800]  but are you really surprised given what the other wiki leaks emails reveal about the level of collusion
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:24.320]  between the cocked media and team hillary they talk about their friendlies in the media who will
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:30.400]  blindly regurgitate their talking points reporters like cmbc's john harwood emailing the clinton
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.320]  campaign begging to be patted on the head like an obedient dog for lavishing praise on hillary the
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:42.080]  new york times asking the clinton campaign for permission to use quotes from their own interview
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:48.240]  with hillary the boston globe colluding with her campaign to give her quote a big presence this level
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:55.760]  of cronyism and corruption is staggering but it explains why much of the media refuses to even cover
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.040]  the wiki leaks releases things like hillary openly admitting that our so-called allies katar
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:07.840]  and saudi arabia are funding and supporting isis oh but trump said the word posse in 2005 so i guess
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.600]  that's more important confirmation that hillary deliberately and criminally deleted certain emails
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:19.200]  to hide evidence of her wrongdoing moles inside bernie sanders campaign who betrayed his strategy
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:25.120]  to tip off hillary bill clinton's behavior pushing a female clinton foundation staffer to near
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:31.840]  suicide insiders within hillary's campaign petrified about the damage posed by bill clinton's sexual
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:38.160]  predatory past oh but you didn't hear about any of this on cnn but you did hear donald trump say
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:45.680]  the word posse in 2005 and to the media that's what matters and they wonder why their readership
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:54.960]  is collapsing they wonder why 94 percent of the american people no longer trust a thing they say
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:15.840]  i mean he is an abject psychopathic demon from hell that as soon as she gets into powers and
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:25.680]  try to destroy the planet she's worked like a demon as you know we came we saw he died what
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.760]  difference at this point does it make and there's only one candidate in this race who understands
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:38.560]  that democracy in a big diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other demonize
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:45.040]  each other you could put half of trump's supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.400]  and i mean that literally by the way there i was i was reading the other day there there's a guy on
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:56.960]  the radio who apparently pumps on a show frequently he said me and hillary are demons i'm telling you
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:06.080]  she is a demon this is biblical she's going to launch a nuclear war
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:14.320]  she said we smell like sulfur ain't that something
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.320]  i mean come on people
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.800]  you can't watch that evil off i'm not kidding people say they say
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:39.040]  that folks i've been told this by high up folks they say listen obama and hillary both smell
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.280]  like sulfur i never said this because the media go crazy with but i've talked to people that are
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:49.440]  in protective details i mean they're scared out there and they say listen she's a freaking demon
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:57.680]  and she stinks and so does obama i go like what sulfur they smell like hell on november 8th the
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:05.440]  arrogance of washington dc will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the american voter
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.680]  it's about time so much of what he's just said is not right but he gets to run his campaign

[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.240]  well we can go to joel gilbert's website or world man daily and and show some of the
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:51.280]  articles while you're speaking right you you next to bill clinton for team viewers watching
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.640]  i mean how much you look like him but i remember back at the time that
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:04.320]  when i first had your aunt on this gotta be 20 years ago almost 19 years ago that this is what
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:08.000]  i was getting from the state police and others so let's let's get into what you talk about
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.240]  in the video when you first start hearing this you i mean before you heard about your mother
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.360]  tried to get you in the scene with the governor's mansion then later you try to get on the property
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:21.840]  when you're older let's let's go through this denny okay well it was my aunt actually um my
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.440]  mom had lost custody of us mine had sure you're right yeah right mine had got custody of her
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:32.560]  mindless here so one day she was like i want you know she she took me down to the government
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.920]  mansion and she was like you know we're going to let him know this that you were his son
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:43.600]  so we went down there and she had to sneak through the gates and she went up to the door
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:49.920]  and the butler answered the door and she asked for uh hillary and the door slammed in her face
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.440]  and they but we was told to get out the property so she she took off running
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.240]  snatched me by one arm and all i can remember was my arm hurting and she snatched me the
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.040]  jump over the fence and she asked me all the time do you remember me taking to the government
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.720]  mansion i said yeah i remember i remember you snatched my arm and taken off running so you know
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:16.400]  i mean it's never went away i mean he has he has delivered christmas gift to my home
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:23.120]  by arkansas state troopers he have paid my mom under the table up until the time he made president
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:30.320]  1993 he stopped doing anything for us so i believe in my heart that he's tried to be in my life
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.000]  well this is a narrative that comes out from everybody that hillary runs the show hillary's
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.520]  the boss right she actually manages him and uses his issues as a control mechanism from your research
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:47.600]  who is it that kept you away from the man you believe to be your father correct i think hillary
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:56.560]  is the one that kept me away i mean as a married couple you your decisions are one so i'm sure
[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:05.440]  she know of me and i'm sure she had parts him in with the the the all the publicity all the stories
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:11.520]  and the press that you know falsely reports all we have taken the DNA all of that is false you know
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:20.800]  so you know i really do think she she has played a part in and as they call banishing me you know
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:29.920]  now i know it's hard for you to talk about but you've discussed mentally psychologically what
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:33.440]  this has done to you i mean go over the years when you first started how old were you first
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:37.840]  started learning about this and then what did you do over the years okay when i first started
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.880]  learning i was probably about eight or nine i was in school and you know my teachers uh they
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.760]  would look at me like they'd be whispering you know it's bill clinton's son his mother the one
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:53.200]  that claims she's she had a baby by bill clinton and you know it's just difficult you know growing up
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:00.240]  house to house you know not stable it just it became difficult my whole life so
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.000]  you know i just thought about it you know i'm like there's something true to it that
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:14.080]  that after all these years they still put out false reports 1999 2000 the false DNA you know
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:19.520]  all these articles that they put out this this false about me but the article that my my mother
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:25.440]  gave in 93 it's you know somebody bought rifle ownership to it and you know it just it makes
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:33.280]  you think so two uh two years almost two years ago two years and a half ago i started my facebook
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:38.800]  page campaigning for me and bill clinton bill clinton been my father i wanted to know and i've
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:44.400]  always wanted to know i just never got any help i reached out to lawyers and investigators they
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:51.200]  would not look into my case no one so i started campaigning my own facebook page and saying bill
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:56.080]  clinton my father and i'm trying to get my story out well keep rolling i love the fact
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:00.080]  down that you're relaxed i can tell you you're nervous who wouldn't be right the head of cnn
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.040]  um jeff zucker and talk about wiki leaks too they order them don't talk about bill clinton sex crimes
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.560]  right don't talk about hillary's health don't talk about it little gentlemen children don't talk about
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:14.320]  it he quote thinks it's a ridiculous hoax even though we went and looked at the star they never
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:19.280]  did the dna test yes sir they did a quote test that wasn't even a dna test so that's how they do it
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:24.240]  that's how they get away with it correct and and and cover it but i mean regardless bill clinton's
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.280]  known for all of this what do you just think about the general sense of what's happening in the country
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:38.640]  today i mean i think a lot about i actually i think you know as far as she stand up and saying uh
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:46.320]  well the kid you know kids gonna be we're gonna make sure kids have the rightful you know taking
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:52.160]  care of them and and rightful schools you know and and all this i i actually think that they are
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:50:02.560]  lies and i think is she just using it to to make to um be in office and to be clear today
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.520]  when i went there about an hour before he went on air i said listen we've never really talked
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:11.840]  we've talked over the phone a couple times my crew has you just flew in today you've been talking
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:16.640]  bigs and stuff i said will you just please write notes on the questions you want me to ask and he
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.400]  and he wrote this up these are your thoughts yes you've got these are your questions one
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:24.240]  then they got brought up is bill clinton a couple weeks ago got asked about his son reported son
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.760]  danny williams uh by a youtuber called charlie in the box i want to skip this network break right
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.560]  this is so important i want to play this since you mentioned this and just again go back to if
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:38.800]  you were really in the room of bill clinton because you are in the room with him he will watch this
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:43.520]  undoubtedly yes sir i mean you know spill it out there because you need to talk directly to him
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.360]  uh because uh i've talked to the arkansas state police back when i was being given these these
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:52.080]  these tips believe it they didn't send people down here to get me fired and get my ass beaten right
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:56.880]  because you weren't his uh you know weren't his illegitimate son they're concerned about this i
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:02.000]  won't talk about your memories with mama and the money and the presence and which humanizes bill
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.360]  right we're not just trying to demonize hillary she was the one even 20 years ago before i knew
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:08.800]  she'd run for president they were saying was shut this down so i want to talk about that with

[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:10.640]  trying all my life to get this out that's right the media spends it like you just popped up now
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:17.840]  right no i was interviewing your aunt 20 years ago it's been articles since 93 99 98 95 when he
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:25.920]  ran for a second term so i mean those articles when i was a kid and now that i'm grown they and
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:31.280]  let's be clear your mother said he was the only white man she was with right correct my mother's
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:35.760]  my mother's face to me all the time her story never changed it's always consistent the same
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:40.000]  how did it start you're you're eight years old what does mama tell you my mama told me that she
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:47.120]  dated him and you know she was she she dated guys for money you know to to afford to take care of us
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:53.920]  so at the time my mother had two oldest sons besides me so she's telling me you know how
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:59.600]  he's pick her up you know she destroys his mother house you know everything she destroys the 93
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:03.920]  last he froze her mother when she was young very beautiful right very beautiful and she's she's
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:10.720]  she's never been always you know as people think she is or she's a drug addict she's this she's
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.920]  that no she's she always done what the best she could to take care of her that along road right
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:23.280]  and right now she's she's at this point in her life right now she's still alive and she's driven
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:28.880]  by guilt on how we was brought up and what she could have done better and you know
[01:55:30.160 --> 01:55:36.240]  and I feel that she's afraid to speak out publicly about this situation and tell her why I mean tell
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:42.080]  us why we know what Hilary did tell us I mean they try to hush her up my mom been pushed out a two
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:46.800]  story window she got middle place in her foot by the way nobody's heard this but there's been
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:50.720]  threats that's why my freak go ahead and tell people right I guess I get threats today on Facebook
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:53.680]  they tell me all that clinton tell people what happened to your mother tell them what the place
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.680]  said tell them what the state police said they're famous for breaking people's arms and legs right
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:02.480]  I mean Jennifer flowers told that she was pushed out a two-story window and this this was told by
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:08.720]  my mom she got a middle plate from her bottom of her toes up to her ankle and I was told that you
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.800]  know people were trying to kill her because of her claim or her having a son by Bill Clinton
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:18.400]  now bottom line we're all returning lives here so please continue talk to your talk to Bill
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:22.880]  I mean this is just what you this is what she gets I mean tell him right and today Bill all I
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:30.000]  want to do is is is to the get the truth out behind who I am and that I am your son and I
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:38.960]  would like for my my kids your grandkids to meet you I mean it's more I can say right now I mean
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.920]  I'm I'm really emotional and sad it's all right I know you broke down crime today before earlier
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:48.720]  I know you thought about suicide tell people to be honest we're here I have thought about suicide
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:53.680]  before because I mean you go through this you know people people don't believe you you know
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.120]  you go through this you're trying to reach your story on people like oh they just a scam he
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:02.000]  he's this he's having Trump Trump never pay I know I don't work for Trump I work for myself I've
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:07.520]  done this two years ago before she even started running she posted rent in 2008 and made president
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:13.680]  I interviewed your aunt 19 years ago right that's nothing to do with Trump right so like I say it's
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:21.680]  the truth on who I am and and where I'm trying to go in my life I know that with me getting my story
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:27.840]  out and helping my kids and raise I raise my kids and I have raised my little sisters and brothers
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:33.440]  I know that one day it is someone out there that might need my help and doesn't go through the same
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:38.800]  thing I I didn't went through in my life so no it's a destined for me oh it makes sense I know
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:43.440]  you've probably this privately but if he's behind the scenes just help out and be with the kids and
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:48.320]  recognize you it's like you want to meet your dad right then you got grandkids these grandkids like
[01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:54.320]  I mean let me tell you if I had a black grandkids I want to know him right correct I mean I don't
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:58:00.160]  care what color they are I love them I had my first child at 16 I dropped out of school in 11 grade
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:04.480]  working full-time in a donut shop to raise my child and my little sisters and brothers
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:10.880]  so like I say it's been hard and rough for me traveling this road but I'll never give up and I
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:16.480]  will not give up until you know he step up and say yes I'm willing to give you a sample I'm willing
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:21.680]  to put this behind us so Bill Clinton give the sample and prove it wrong with the third party's
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:27.360]  watching it right he got into it folks but his mother got threatened by the state police and
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.440]  Hillary in person they put her in prison or killer then she got thrown out a window a month later
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:35.920]  and we've already been threatened over this interview today just so you know
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:42.240]  and when I had his aunt on I got beat up a week later thank you for listening to GCN

[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:59.840]  because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most I mean
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:04.960]  I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:11.600]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:17.280]  lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around we have
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:21.920]  biological warfare going on everywhere these are all parasites tell us about all this episode
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:26.240]  there's so many things that are in it you have the neem in there you have the organic clove bud the
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:31.360]  organic wormwood I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right well
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:34.640]  I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today it just came back in

[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:48.320]  from the Global Healing Center thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:54.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:59:54.400 --> 02:00:22.480]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:32.160]  powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media the press
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.720]  let's be clear on one thing
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:48.160]  the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism
[02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:57.280]  they're a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:03.920]  with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you it's for themselves
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:19.680]  and their agenda is to elect crooked Hillary Clinton at any cost at any price no matter
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:32.160]  how many lives they destroy for them it's a war and for them nothing at all is out of bounds
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:43.200]  this is a struggle for the survival of our nation believe me and this will be our last chance to
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:49.920]  save it on November 8th remember that you know what's incredible about watching Trump's speeches
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:54.880]  unedited like I do on a routine basis when he gives three or four a day I switch amazing
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:00.720]  stamina so I don't catch more than maybe one a day and maybe it's eight o'clock at night the
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:06.080]  kids have done their homework they've taken showers we've had dinner and we don't watch a lot of tv
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:11.200]  we watch movies a couple times a week or whatever and I let them watch a few shows here and there
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:15.600]  when they've done their chores they've done a good job and gotten you know straight a's but we'll
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:19.520]  all just sit down and in my eight year old my 12 year old daughter and my and my 14 year old son
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:24.960]  and I say what do you want to watch they say we want to go to the Donald Trump channel on YouTube
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:30.240]  we want to watch his speech today and we'll go there and we'll oh look there's five speeches
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:35.520]  today which one would you like to watch and we'll sit down and we'll watch Donald Trump for 30 minutes
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:40.400]  or an hour my children they all teach you your kids don't want to listen to you your kids don't want
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:47.760]  to admire you you study history you're fighting evil and you're in a tribal situation and and
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:52.240]  your kids understand it all they want to do is do what you say but they want to get our families
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.120]  to stabilize from the beginning while fighting with each other once they get the unnatural dynamic
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:02.240]  going once they try to convince the man to act like a child the woman to act like she's the boss
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:09.200]  and get everything destabilized once that starts it's like a top a gyro wobbling a gyro that's
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:16.160]  stable it's going perfect a gyro that's wobbling it's out of control and once kids get it that
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.800]  we're a family we've got to stick together we care about each other and we only care about
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:26.080]  people that care about us and that people that are truthful and nice and not that my kids are
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:31.040]  perfect you know they're far from enough spoiled them at certain levels but they win all the
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:38.080]  everything I mean it's amazing um he could do it at state level he wanted to but we
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:43.760]  he didn't need to but Rex is now a man he had been on the air in over a year he's been so busy but
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:49.040]  he wants to be on air he's on air soon but he looks like he's about 16 17 14 just turned 14
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.880]  and he wins all the big speech debate deals he wins all the big
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:04:00.080]  big I mean you name it um and I'm not bragging about my kids it's just that they're confident
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.880]  they know what's going on in the world they got a gleam in their eye and look at the average kid
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:10.400]  that gleams been stolen from and I want my kids play video games folks I don't let them sit there
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:15.040]  and just sit there with a smartphone all day and drool I have phones I give to them when they're
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:18.320]  going somewhere I want to know what they're at it's like big brother well government's gonna
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.400]  watch you I'm gonna watch you too here go with this are you gonna do a sleepover boom take this
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:27.040]  with you but it's like a weapon it's like an evil we roll out for limited uses you know because
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:33.280]  because we we have ways of turning that towards good at least we believe we do none of us are
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:43.840]  perfect but it's actually true the country is done the world's done uh if the Brexit fails
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:48.800]  if Europe continues the EU and if Trump doesn't get in I mean if nationalism
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.600]  and patriotism doesn't win because globalism is pure death globalism is world government
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.240]  globalism is scientific tyranny it's the enemy
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:05.040]  the japanese coastline has been struck again and the Fukushima reactor cooling system it stops

[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:30.560]  on the cooling system servicing the unit 3 spent fuel pool was not able to circulate water to cool
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:35.600]  nuclear fuel because of a broken pump all of this is according to the nuclear regulatory agency
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:40.640]  it turns out that this plant for the second time has been hit and the immediate danger
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:45.040]  although the agency admitted gradual rising temperatures the exact cause of this cooling

[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:50.560]  i love him so much i love them what does that make hillary clinton to the bush family my sister-in-law
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:55.680]  when you are subverting the power of government that that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:10:01.200]  democracy what do you think of edwards fadden i think he's a traitor obama is the one that kills
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.440]  the us troops if the russians bomb any of them obama is the one that put him in harm's way
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:10.800]  obama is the one using him as human shields it is the most corrupt degenerate criminal
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:15.280]  government in american history i'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:28.080]  a game we got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now we're armed to the
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:33.680]  teeth and we're not scared you got that you sons of bitches in 2012 your agency was saying quote
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.960]  the salafists the muslim brotherhood and al-qaeda in iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:44.960]  in syria in 2012 the us was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups and why did
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:49.200]  you not stop that why didn't you come forward before what were you waiting for well for you
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:11:04.000]  inspector i needed you i suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected we're all part of it
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:16.480]  are we ready for it from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.040]  ladies and gentlemen we are all part of it history is happening donald trump has said
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:32.400]  the future of this country surviving is on the line not that he's perfect he'll tell you that
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:37.040]  but that the globalist are ending national sovereignty world government has been announced
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:42.560]  and thank god he came along who had the courage to magnify our work ron paul's work your work
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:47.840]  it's now mainstream and there are nationalist movements around the world moving forward
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:54.400]  notice since nizal forage of ukip we've been interviewing for 15 years uh met with uh trump
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:59.200]  and has actually been staying in the u.s coaching him since the disastrous first debate
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:04.640]  uh trump's gotten 10 times more hardcore against the globalist and how it's about sovereignty
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.760]  and outside interests like carlo slim of mexico really an arab uh and the communist chinese and
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:15.120]  the and the islamist the sadi arabians controlling us notice trump suddenly has become laser beam
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:24.400]  very powerful and that's because forage is basically as informed as i am or even more
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.000]  him he's i mean i've had dinner with him i've known him for years uh he was obviously on the
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.880]  show just a few weeks ago we've done tape interviews with him we're going to be talking to him again
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:36.400]  next week forage gets the whole deal he's the guy that helped begin the fall of the e u now every
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:41.840]  e u country is demanding a referendum because no one was allowed to have a referendum you're just
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:46.560]  suddenly under the e u because your politicians sell you out like obama saying we're under the tpp
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:53.360]  in the carbon tax even if we don't ratify it and the media is like obama's smart he doesn't need
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:57.360]  congress he's just gonna ratify it let's not smart to break the law it's not smart to just have the
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:05.920]  bureaucracy do whatever it wants but that's the big widespread you know 40 000 35 000 foot view
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:11.440]  it's important to zoom in and do snapshots of different individuals now i'm not one to defend
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:16.480]  bill clinton but i've been covering the clinton's for 21 years on air i've been following it for
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:27.600]  23 years since they became you know husband or since that election uh in 1992 1993 and hillary
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:32.880]  to me is the main villain and i don't say that because that's a campaign strategy and you know
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:37.040]  we'll you know we'll talk about bill how bad he is but how she's even worse it's the truth it's
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:41.920]  come out she was president already basically eight years co-president she is the one that handled the
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:47.200]  quote bimbo eruptions she is the one that what is actually out doing the work and making the money
[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.400]  and and and selling the country out as we see in the clinton foundation bill spending most this time
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:56.640]  partying and he does do some work obviously he's now a surrogate for her because she's obviously ill
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.840]  but looking at what just comes out all the horrible things hillary does in these wiki leaks and
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:06.640]  how she hates the american people is mind-boggling but we had a lady on one of the you know many
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:10.960]  folks that have been you know a connection to the clinton's who's spoken out but i wanted to have her
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:15.680]  here in person i appreciate her coming down from arkansas a lovely lady but both in her looks and
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:21.760]  also in her demeanor because she really i thought connected with myself in the audience she's not
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:25.600]  somebody that says bill clinton raped her she's somebody that dated bill clinton but can speak
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:31.200]  to the whole situation really from a very honest perspective but it's now come out they're calling
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:35.520]  thousands of former contestants in all of his pageants going back 30 years and and they're
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:39.360]  coming out saying i'm not gonna lie for you but they're really going after trump right now and
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:44.560]  trying to project onto trump who bill clinton was so that even becomes a distraction onto who is
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:50.960]  hillary but the book dolly kyle a political memoir hillary the other woman forwarded by
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:56.960]  david p shepherds who's a great patriot he was the head impeachment lawyer who exposed that actually
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:03.200]  ken star was a chinese agent and basically worked for the chinese now officially works for him
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:07.600]  that's been proven he was the chief investigative counsel for the clinton impeachment we should try
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:12.480]  to get you know folks from that whole impeachment back on uh we have had the former congressman
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:18.160]  from george obviously on uh but if you're going to talk tell the whole story there has to be absolute
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.960]  accountability that's hillary clinton quote you're a great writer dolly promises me you will never
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:28.080]  censor anything you might want to say bill clinton dolly is keeping her promise not to censor the
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:33.120]  truth she is telling the whole truth here but hillar will not be happy about it hillary is the one
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.160]  being called to account for her lies shady financial deals uh racial discrimination
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:42.960]  one chef got killed the other chefs come out and said it's true she would just scream in or
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:48.400]  and flip out foul mouth flip-flopping destruction of government records from arkansas to washington
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:53.600]  have been gauzy lack of true feminist credentials and her decades-long history of attacking many
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:58.400]  women who were used and abused by her husband the co-president i'ma skip this network record
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:04.160]  we have more time uh with dolly kyle here today but uh thank you so much for coming into studio
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:09.120]  with us well you're very welcome i'm happy to be here alex you're awesome wow i mean i've thrown
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:12.800]  a lot out there you should probably just recap with folks that didn't hear you on a few months ago
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:18.240]  who you are what happened what unfolded uh i ran to you and clave wanted the rnc as well
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.120]  and then just your perspective of somebody who's been there since what high school or was even
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:28.960]  earlier with bill clinton right i met billy when i was 11 and he was 12 going on 13 we had a middle
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:34.960]  school yeah well i went to catholic school so we didn't break it up like that eighth grade
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:39.440]  but then there were no other catholic schools there but billy was uh we were at hot springs
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:46.560]  high school together then we graduated in 64 so uh we're in the same class and yes i am
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:51.680]  two years younger because i skipped two grades so let's get the bimbo thing out of the way right
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:56.480]  now okay no bimbo here i am a lawyer you don't look like a bimbo and you look amazing for your
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:04.800]  age you look like you're about 45 i'll take it thank you i'm joking now anyway um the important
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:10.720]  thing is really not so much the fact that i had an adult sexual relationship with billy but the
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:18.560]  fact that i have known him since i was 11 years old and i am an intelligent observant person
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:23.440]  and i know what's been going on with the clinton's for all these years so that's what's important
[02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:29.520]  i did not want to write this book alex but when i saw hillary look into the camera and get that
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:34.480]  fake sincere look that she has and say that women who've been raped and sexually assaulted should be
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:40.640]  believed okay that did it for me i was ready to throw a shoe at the tv screen but it was a new tv
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:45.600]  and it wouldn't have done me any good so i wrote this book instead and i just started it last year
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:48.880]  at the beginning and your own record you know in the yearbooks with clinton i mean i don't think
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:53.680]  he's really he's not denied that he is that you were his girlfriend either well actually i don't
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.880]  early on he didn't um early on of course he didn't but then i was subpoenaed to testify in the paula
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:06.400]  jones case and billy's lawyers wanted me to not testify not because we didn't have a relationship
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:12.240]  but because our relationship was consensual and the jones case was about sexual harassment so billy's
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:17.440]  own lawyers prepared an affidavit for me to sign saying that our relationship was consensual
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:23.120]  and they wanted me to file a motion in federal court not to testify because i didn't know about
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:29.920]  harassment only about these consensual sex the problem that billy's lawyers did not know was
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:35.680]  that i was going to testify about billy's sex addiction which he had confessed to me after
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:41.680]  alex i found out i was a sex addict and i got into therapy and i told billy about that
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:49.040]  as any friend would do well it must be a terrible thing to be a sex addict well actually alex anyone
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:54.320]  who can have a drink at a cocktail party and enjoy it thinks that alcohol is fine i have nothing against
[02:18:54.320 --> 02:19:01.200]  alcohol but if you take one drink and you can't stop and you ruin your life then it's not so great
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:06.240]  absolutely no i mean what is a sex addict does somebody just can't control themselves there are
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:10.960]  a lot of aspects of it just as there are different kinds of alcoholics and i say alcoholics because
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:15.120]  more people have more experience with that more knowledge of it there's an alcoholic who gets up
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:19.120]  in the morning and has alcohol for breakfast there's one who doesn't drink until five o'clock
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:23.040]  there's one who binges on the weekends there's one who binges every six months there's all
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:27.600]  different sorts of alcoholism but it does not excuse someone driving down the street drunk
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:32.240]  and killing a person no i totally agree with you so so i mean bill clinton i mean isn't admitted
[02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:37.360]  like superstar sex addict i mean what's the word on it i reportedly up to ten women a day when he
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:42.560]  was president well i don't know how many women per day i do know that once a long time ago we
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:47.040]  were discussing wilt chamberlain who was the african-american basketball star who said he'd
[02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:53.840]  had sex with 20 000 women and billy and i were talking about that and he said whoa that's 10
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:58.640]  times more than i've had and i think he said that with a bit of admiration and a little jealousy
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:04.240]  but he was saying he really had 2000 yeah and let's say he was exaggerating and it was only
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:11.520]  1000 how's that better i don't think so all i think all in any manner one wants to find is the
[02:20:11.520 --> 02:20:16.480]  is the right person so then there's one and that's who you love well i don't think he knows about love
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:22.560]  well i can say personally just raw sex for me is empty and i was a little promiscuous when i was
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:27.920]  younger nothing like wilt chamberlain or bill clinton but it just was so empty and for me sex
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:34.320]  is really all about the relationship it should be and what happened and i'm not excusing it
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:40.000]  but when i was a 16 year old virgin i was drugged and raped by one of billy clinton's friends
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.760]  and a rape will change the trajectory of someone's life now sometimes people don't admit it they don't
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:51.440]  even admit to themselves what happened in this in the effect does it mean either either person
[02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:58.960]  becomes very withdrawn and a spinster or they become wild well that's what i talk about in my book yes
[02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:03.200]  and again that's hillary the other woman so so going back to where you started
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:07.040]  that was intriguing you were suddenly when was it you were spurred into action
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:11.840]  spurred into the spotlight because of hillary and the way she was behaving uh you know claiming we
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:17.120]  should always stand up for women that are assaulted but then going after bill's victims well that was
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:24.480]  just at the beginning of 2016 i mean i wrote 92 000 words in 65 days of writing i did take off on
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:30.480]  sundays i also want to say to anyone who wants to start throwing stones right now that having the
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:36.720]  affair with billy was wrong i have repented i have changed my life and i had invited him to do that too
[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:40.960]  but that hasn't happened yet yeah well nobody's judging anybody for consensual sex even though
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:44.960]  i can't get out of hand i think you're saying it was out of hand absolutely nobody's judging you
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:48.800]  for i mean that give me a break and anybody that tries that especially the left they're all
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:55.440]  oh sex party all this degenerate stuff but then they act like you know like like these uh super
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:22:00.080]  obsessed you know orthodox people when somebody conservatives involved in it it seems like a
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:06.000]  very very one-sided situation well it absolutely is and here's the other thing forget the sexual
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:11.040]  relationship that i had with billy because my entire family he's been friends with the clinton's
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:17.200]  family for years so i have an inside observation whether or not billy and i ever had a relationship
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:23.520]  has bill clinton got more evil or less evil over time oh my goodness you know i didn't
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:30.080]  know anything was wrong with him until the night in 1974 when he introduced me to hillary and that
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:35.840]  was the night of the democrat convention in arkansas and hillary had come in from washington
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:41.360]  but i did not know that billy called and asked me to pick him up at the airport and wanted me to
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:48.560]  take him to the television headquarters and then to fulbright headquarters i said sure i mean this
[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:54.000]  was no big deal we were adults we were dating i was divorced at that time and so it was a totally
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.200]  open sexual relationship he was also seeing marla crider at the university that's pretty wild
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:03.680]  though he's got hot blonde going over to pick up his other girlfriend well yeah but i didn't know
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:07.520]  that and so he showed up at the airport so he's pretty bold he showed up at the airport with
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:12.080]  this dowdy looking middle-aged woman and three guys in suits and when they got closer i realized
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:18.560]  that the dowdy middle-aged woman was just dowdy but not middle-aged and billy said dolly this is
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:25.680]  hillary hillary did he tell you dolly wow did did he tell you she was a cia officer oh no no
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:30.880]  he didn't say anything about that and one thing that you need to understand about billy and all
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:37.600]  other addicts is that they will tell different people different things so that they never exposed
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:44.480]  themselves excuse the pun completely to anyone but they show different sides of themselves for
[02:23:44.480 --> 02:23:49.920]  example billy showed his cocaine addiction to other people but not to me because he knew i was very
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.320]  definitely against drugs so he wouldn't bring that up he could show a sex addiction to me
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:59.840]  because that was okay because i understood that he was a he was a chameleon absolutely oh yes we
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:05.360]  got to this part it's the first time 1974 democrat convention happened in arkansas here comes hillary
[02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:11.920]  with the guys in suits whether uh tell us what happens next well we my first thought was oh dear
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:16.800]  remember the seinfeld episode with the valet parker who smelled bad yes uh well i thought the
[02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:22.160]  first thing i thought was oh my gosh i have cloth seats in my car and believe me i was worried about
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:29.200]  my car but i let this woman get in there anyway he smelled that bad she really did alex she really
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:35.360]  truly did and i'm not just being tacky call me margaret meetin samoa i had never seen or
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:42.160]  smelled any woman like that ever did we talk before you got here today no why when's the last
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:47.760]  time you talked to me well i guess on the radio show yeah months ago we fly by the seat of our
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.240]  pants we're just boom boom boom yeah it's a big nash are you where the national controversy
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.640]  right now is turning me i mean the president responded to it no i don't think so what happened
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.760]  i it was the top story three days ago i just said for my secret service horses they and i also
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:06.000]  talked to people in protective detail from the pentagon they said we don't know what's going on
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:12.160]  but hillary smells like a dead pig and i talked about it and they said i was completely insane i
[02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:16.720]  said she smells like a demon and that obama stinks to our heaven oh i did hear that yes
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:21.280]  about the demon thing yeah well i don't know what a dead pig smells like i do well the point
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.240]  is they smell like hell but but it's funny but i don't be right about the book but wow that's
[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:30.160]  crazy i mean we're gonna how bad she smelled i'm just telling you people are telling me she smells
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:34.960]  so what she smell like just i don't know i'd never smelled anything like that before i mean her hair
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:41.680]  was dirty and greasy and her dress was stained so i assume it was something on her inner she hadn't
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:50.960]  bathed i listen i've had two black water people an army colonel secret service just say we're scared
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:57.440]  of her she blows up and screams half the time fits falls down angry i mean like a two-year-old
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:01.520]  and smells like and i go what they go it's the worst smell you've ever smelled and it's just you
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:05.120]  didn't even know this and here you are bringing it up no because it was the first one of the first
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:09.680]  things that i noticed and who could not notice someone who smelled that bad especially when
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:12.560]  they were going to get in my car with cloths that's what i tell listeners i'm not going to
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:16.640]  make this up if we're not getting these sources so so well ask anyone in arkansas who met her back
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:23.680]  then don't don't take my word for it this wasn't just normal hippie body odor i wouldn't think so
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:29.040]  all right please continue so what else are you stinking creature arrived the thing that
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:33.120]  really bothered me that night i started to talk about you said is billy more evil now
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:40.240]  you would have to know how important senator bill fulbright was in billy clinton's life in
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:46.240]  order to get this at the level that i do but when billy clinton went to georgetown as a freshman
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:54.000]  in 1964 bill fulbright gave him a job fulbright had been um i don't know 64 he'd been 20 years
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:59.120]  in the in the senate from arkansas at that point he gave billy a job he introduced him to
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:04.400]  everybody in washington he was important when billy wanted to go to oxford bill fulbright helped
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:08.320]  him get the road scholarship he helped him to get into yale he helped him to get a job at the
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:14.240]  university of arkansas teaching and then when billy in 1974 was running for congress from the
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:19.360]  um fourth congressional district in northwest arkansas a good memory it was bill fulbright
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:24.080]  who introduced him to the big money folks who would support that race so i say all that to
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:30.240]  say this the night of may 28th 1974 the democrat primary i picked up billy at the airport we went
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:33.760]  to the tv station so billy could do a statewide interview which was the only place you could
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:40.080]  do that at the time and maybe still now i'm not sure anyway um while he was doing the interview
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.560]  this strange smelling person who i really didn't believe was hillary i thought it was some kind
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:48.640]  of a joke because billy had told me two years before that he was moving in with a law student
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:52.720]  named hillary she had a place to live no big deal as a code-looking creature with goggle glasses
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:56.480]  it was not pretty it was not pretty it smells like a pet of hell dirty hair
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:03.760]  all of that anyway all linsky worshippers she was watching the election returns and then when
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:08.480]  we left the tv station to go to fulbright headquarters billy said well we need to go back
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:13.040]  to the airport and i said why we were going to fulbright headquarters they're expecting you
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:18.480]  i mean you can't know this this man fulbright was like billy's father godfather never had no not god
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:23.280]  father like a father he never had it was it was critically important and billy said well we're
[02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:28.080]  not going didn't you see the election returns fulbright's losing i said yeah sure he's losing
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:35.120]  i mean all the more reason to go over and support him and billy said i don't want to be seen with a
[02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:42.400]  loser and i felt like i'd been kicked in the stomach and of course i thought about what about
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:46.960]  this that's what i always hear is they love to betray their friends now at this point it begins
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:52.080]  well yeah and here's the thing i was so upset about that and of course i didn't realize that hillary
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:56.640]  was hillary i seriously i thought it was a joke really i thought it was a joke so i didn't realize
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:01.200]  billy had kicked me in the gut can we pull up a photo of hillary in college or where she worked
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:05.680]  in the nixon anti-nixon committee i mean let's let's pull her up it looks like a joke let's continue
[02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:13.120]  okay anyway i i was devastated to realize that billy would turn his back on bill fulbright like
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:19.120]  that i really was it made me physically sick the same kind of physically sick i was when i saw one
[02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:25.120]  nita broadrex interview with lisa mire on date light nbc and found out he was also a rapist and
[02:29:25.120 --> 02:29:30.560]  we have those clips when we come back so to you it's the dishonor robin oh my gosh yes well it's
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:35.440]  funny you know i hillary had all those men in suits around her she was no no no these were billy's
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:39.440]  friends this was not the guys in suits then these were just billy's friends i mean it's been declassified
[02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:44.240]  she was like a cia his controller by the time they moved to england and all the rest of it later
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:51.520]  and it it's an amazing story her dad was like a mob boss in chicago we're on the march the empires on
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:30:02.000]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network it looks like president elect donnell trump is
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:06.960]  making good on his promises day one of the trump presidency to withdraw from the tpp we have an
[02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:11.520]  article it's up on our website info wars dot com and aggregated from cns news it talks about how
[02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:16.080]  trump characterized the move a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of quote putting

[02:30:29.600 --> 02:30:33.760]  which has been the centerpiece of the obama administration he's going to rebalance it now
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:38.720]  the obama administration wanted to rebalance to asia but trump called that a horrible idea he's
[02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:42.960]  saying in an online video message that one of his top priorities in the first 100 days is to
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:47.840]  ask his transition team to quote develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:52.960]  restore our laws and bring back our jobs it's about time we echoes a sentiment that every day

[02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:20.560]  it's friday october 14th 2016 we are now only 24 short days out in the november eighth election
[02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:32.400]  it's time to kick the persistence in the high gear
[02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:54.400]  i was just talking to dolly kyle and she's nervous to say this but i was i was looking
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:58.960]  at her because i know she went to law school on the top folks in her class she's very successful
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:03.040]  economically she didn't want to come out and write this book with world net daily books
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:08.320]  she did it because she felt compelled to do it and she said well i mean i was going from memory
[02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:11.840]  because i knew that from inside baseball knowing the publishers that you basically don't even want
[02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:15.440]  any money because they've asked me to publish a book with them too i've just been too busy quite
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:20.480]  frankly uh great publishers over at world net daily books get the uh book hillary the other woman
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:26.880]  dolly kyle total credibility uh in fact let's we should go through your curriculum vitae
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:31.360]  for new listeners you're not doing this to sell a book you're doing it to try to wake people up
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:37.840]  and expose what happens if we let these criminals continue to be empowered you said well yes i can't
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:42.640]  do it on your show because you're too big because i've been telling people if you can't afford it
[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:47.280]  i'll send you a copy or send you a check to get it you've actually been doing that but so don't do
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:52.480]  that here you just want this to get out you're not doing this for money you're doing this for honor
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:57.760]  so continue with your story continue breaking it down well i do want to say this i did send my
[02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:03.360]  publisher a request this morning that see if we could lower the price of the kindle version of
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:08.160]  this book at least between now and the election there are limitations what you can do with amazon
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:13.520]  i know we're selling our hillary for president's shirt at cost i'm spending the backup money we
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:17.600]  have because any operation want this has to have backup money yeah i know it's so serious the last
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:24.800]  six months i've hired more people done more just put everybody's sale on we can to try to defeat
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:28.640]  the globalist because i can feel in my gut this is such a game changer we're we're all in at this
[02:35:28.640 --> 02:35:34.160]  point that's absolutely true i do want to say one more thing about amazon my book went to number one
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:38.880]  on kindle i took a screenshot that day i was i was so tickled because hamilton had been number one
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:43.840]  and i was number two that hamilton was so huge and then one day wow i went to number one and the
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:47.760]  next day it was number one and so i was looking for my number one sticker from amazon because you
[02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:52.640]  know once you hit number one then you can always say i was a number one best seller on amazon right
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:56.800]  forever except they wouldn't give me the number one sticker and i had my publisher call and say
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.440]  what's the deal and they said well there's more to getting a number one sticker than being number one
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:06.720]  and my publisher said so what else is there well that's proprietary information
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:11.520]  which means we decide who who gets that it's all exactly but but what's coming up this election
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:15.760]  is how rigged everything is everyone should get the book hillary the other woman available on amazon
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:20.480]  worldnetdaily.com i might be in pain to promote any of this i'm doing this to get the word out
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:26.720]  because this is a very credible lady exposing all of this now now let's walk into where bill
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:30.160]  plenton goes from there what's happening with these women and why you're speaking out you
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:34.720]  mentioned Juanita Broderick we've had on years ago and then i'm biggest about six months ago
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:42.000]  here's the first clip Juanita Broderick supports Bill Clinton rape protest this is a national
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.400]  movement we launched it's very successful because they want to send their people find about
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:51.120]  George Soros to beat people up and start riots we don't do that we say legally lawfully go
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:56.160]  and you were telling me you're aware of this movement yes i am and and someone sent a tweet
[02:36:56.160 --> 02:37:01.840]  about it the other day and i said hey thank alex jones for that because you started it well i want
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:04.880]  to thank the listeners that are going out and doing it but yes our our listeners are who we
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:09.120]  thank and they're awesome folks yeah apparently so well it's happened two or three times a day
[02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:13.840]  obama hillary bill and i'm told hillary was even the associate of press she's getting pissed
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:18.000]  that she's saying she may cancel events because of it well of course because she cannot
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.800]  face truth this is one of the big things about hillary she can't talk about her psychology
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:28.400]  i've had two secret service on fbi on everybody they say she won't she won't give tips little
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:33.600]  people she blows up that don't look her in the eyes and that she she just blows up constantly
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:39.040]  what's going on with her i explain this in a couple of chapters in the book so it's pretty hard to
[02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:47.920]  cover it all right now but we all know even from hillary's own autobiography what a sad childhood
[02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:54.400]  she had with a controlling drill sergeant kind of father whom she never could please i also think
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:38:00.480]  and this is completely my opinion based on what i know about sex addiction that i believe hillary
[02:38:00.480 --> 02:38:06.800]  was sexually assaulted by a female i also believe that she was sexually assaulted by a male possibly
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:13.440]  someone in military uniform which is why she hates the military she hates men she hates women
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:17.840]  she you said that like four months ago when you're on it yeah but it's in the wiki league she hates
[02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:22.800]  the military exactly and i said she hates americans she hates everyone don't you see because she
[02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:27.760]  hates herself and you can look at a video of her turn off the sound and look at the hate
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:33.200]  coming out of her eyes i mean it's hate and well that's what general flin said former head of army
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:37.360]  intelligence and i've been told by folks there's a psychological dossier in her and that's why the
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:40.720]  russians have done their own breakdown that's everybody's so concerned they say they believe
[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:45.680]  she'll start major wars that she hates everyone and that she is extremely unstable and general
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.560]  flin has said that he they believe she's unstable well the other thing too about the russians it's
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:57.520]  very interesting that hillary is now blaming these wiki leaks on the russians and think about that
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:03.680]  people the clinton foundation hillary took tens of millions of dollars from the russians 35 million
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:12.000]  yeah um and turned over 20 of our uranium supplies to the russians and what hillary does with the
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.280]  russians and with everything else pay attention to this very carefully everything that she does
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:23.280]  that she says someone else does like trump it's all projection 101 if she says trump it's racist
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:27.680]  it's because she's racist if he says she's controlled by the he's controlled by the russians
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:33.120]  it's because she's controlled by the russians and it was very simple for the russians for anyone
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:39.600]  else to find out who was behind the wiki leaks and if anyone thinks that seth rich was killed
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:46.080]  randomly in a robbery on the back shot in the back in washington think again this guy was going to
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:51.840]  talk to the fbi and anyone who knew anything knew it now here's the other thing they did not try to
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:55.600]  hide the fact that this was a hit i mean i grew up in hot springs you know alex i got some great
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:59.760]  chapters in here that's a famous that was a real mafia headquarter it was it was a wonderful place
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:05.280]  it's a wonderful place to grow up and and find out interesting things about people but here's the
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:12.720]  deal this was a hit and they intended for people to know it was a hit because this is one of the
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:16.960]  ways they intimidate other people it's like well it's like scalia they had ounce of pillows on his
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:21.920]  head that there will be no autopsy the first announcement and they put the news he was in a
[02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:28.080]  secret society there just to demonize him when it was a hunting society and now we have podesta the
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:33.280]  chief of staff for hillary talk about wet work two days before he died saying get ready well and
[02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:41.200]  look what happened when vince foster died that was more wet work died and billy supposedly found
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:46.080]  out about it on larry king lives and the first thing he said now here's his friend of his friends
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:50.640]  since childhood maybe since the the playpen i think their mothers were friends when they were
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:56.080]  pregnant from hope arkansas and the first thing billy says when he finds out his long time friend
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:05.840]  is dead he says well we'll never know what really happened really we'll never know that's his first
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:09.840]  reaction he's shot in the head with no blood at the same obviously taken there yeah and that's his
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:15.360]  reaction what was your reaction be if one of your long time friends was committed suicide i'd get
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:22.160]  dizzy i'd sit there and be i'd say really i'd start crying yeah well you're human but you were
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:26.640]  saying earlier on bill seemed more human he seems to am i wrong to say hillary's the boss though from
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:30.880]  all my research over the years all the way this seems to be she's the boss she found this flawed
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:37.200]  guy she made him worse he wasn't a beard for homosexuality she was a beard for his drug abuse
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  and sex behavior it's hard to say that she really controls him i talk about in the book the attraction
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:47.680]  was that she is his mean controlling grandmother remember he was not raised by his mother for
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:52.240]  the first four or five years of his life now why does she get all glassy eyed and keep calling trump
[02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:56.000]  my my husband and then she only went off script to talk about me and i'm not getting on a power
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:59.200]  trip because i don't want her to track to me but she talks about me she goes how does he have such
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:04.400]  a dark heart she gets like no i mean now when she attacks me she kind of acts all weird like
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:08.000]  she'll give a speech he talks about me she gets real weird what the hell's going on it's really
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:13.760]  creepy it is creepy and that's unfortunately not the creepiest thing about her but so what do you
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:17.840]  think the psychology is your const your lawyer well this is and you know i was a psych major
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:21.360]  before i was i knew that you're a smart lady so what do you think's going on with her um he talks
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:26.000]  about trump she starts seeming she seems to get excited well like like she seems a little bit
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.240]  attracted to trump i mean i pick up the body language i'm sorry well here's the thing about
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:37.360]  trump he's a real man he is a real man and i think that's what's attracting a lot of people
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:43.760]  just like men were attracted to john wane in a way i mean you know that he swagger's in and he
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:49.200]  takes control and he solves the problems and i think that's what we all recognize that donald
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:54.480]  trump can do we don't know how he's going to do it and guess what he probably doesn't know how either
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:59.600]  but this is a successful businessman who knows how to delegate well he's not out to get us if they
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:03.440]  just not out to get us and look who he chose for a vice president i mean look how he turned
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:08.080]  mexican president with one meeting for him because i know it was said little bird told me he said
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:12.160]  listen you've been screwed over by globalism let's come together let's make both our country's rich
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:16.960]  let's break this multinational collateral system that wants us poor he came out the Mexican president
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:21.600]  was glowing i mean that's all we need to do is have prosperity yes and the other thing is look at
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:26.720]  his first big decision mike pence for peace sake what a fabulous guy we were gonna talk about that
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:33.760]  look how christie's about to get indicted we've got a former speaker again which is coming out
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:39.680]  against trump look how pence has been really a stroller he didn't pick the right guy he picked an
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:45.280]  absolutely sad he's loyal he's loyal well and he's he's bright he's articulate he's knowledgeable
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:52.240]  he is principled i met him and his wife in florida last month and i was very impressed with him
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:59.040]  with those of them i just think that this shows right up front trump's ability to pick the right
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.160]  people i'm not groveling is that ever an actual like this but i mean it's trump not a godsend
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:07.280]  i think so and you know i've i said uh i think it was in my sunday school i said you know for
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.400]  years a lot of us christians have been praying for our country praying praying praying and i believe
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:18.800]  god has a sense of humor and it may be donald trump is the answer to prayer he is not the person
[02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:23.520]  that any of us but look at the bible it never was like that no it never was that's exactly it god
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:30.560]  always chooses interesting people and that's what we have here we we don't have the person who would
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:36.240]  be the stereotypical hero to come in and go to washington but what we have in washington is a
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:41.840]  cesspool and don't get me started on that with republicans try to get more into bill clinton
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:46.640]  more of your book but i want to get into this okay i mean they attend the emails they're out to get
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:51.200]  the average american they hate their black supporters they hate poor white supporters
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:55.280]  it's like they want to make you dependent then they disdain you when they make you dependent
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:44:59.520]  the nastiness of these emails there's so many thousands i can keep track how we're going to
[02:44:59.520 --> 02:45:03.520]  keep them dumb we're going to keep them poor we knew all this but reading this it's like
[02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:08.240]  how the hell do you write this and send it to somebody like i want to keep my employees poor
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:12.960]  i want poor people and i want them to meanwhile you're like i'm liberal oh you know it's just
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:18.320]  what the hell well i have a chapter in here in the book called the plantation mentality
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:24.080]  and that's why i say everything that's happening is in this book it's foreshadowed it's foretold it's
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:30.240]  explained the sound it really is some weird business it is it is all it's all in here because
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:35.600]  nothing has changed in 45 years and here's the thing you talk about something that's racist
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:40.240]  how about open borders how about letting all these people come in here who will work for
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:45.200]  four dollars an hour what is that doing oh they're a permanent underclass exactly they're the new
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:49.600]  underclass be the bottom and then to bring us down that's right because i want to bring everybody
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:54.640]  up and african americans and women and hispanics who are here legally are the ones who are going
[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:58.640]  to be the most hurt by this open borders thing not to mention the rest of us and then it doesn't
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:02.160]  bring the other countries up all this all the studies are done well they admit the plan is to
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:07.600]  drive down wages break us and why did mexico build a wall on its southern border oh i know
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:11.680]  once you're informed it's all hypocrisy so looking at this then what does your gut tell
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:14.640]  you about the election because we have the internal polls i told people like three months
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:18.160]  ago and they said he was starting to lose he was 10 points ahead suddenly five points behind us
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:22.560]  it's all bull and it keeps coming out none of this is working he's he's way ahead hillary's
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:27.680]  panicking her internal emails show this they're suddenly homeland security comes in to save the
[02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:33.520]  election from the russians this is unprecedented if they try a coup in front of us of a landslide
[02:46:33.520 --> 02:46:38.080]  what does trump do because they're so mad he says he's going to fight i hope he does and
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:46.640]  what i say is this alex hillary cannot win this election now she may be able to steal it
[02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:53.440]  but she cannot win it well i mean she has 200 people at her events he has 30 000 exactly i've
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:58.000]  been to some trump events oh my gosh and they're not just there the people are not just there
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:03.680]  they're there it's like an arkansas razor bank football game they're all they're all around it's
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.360]  like a big camp out absolutely they're all excited and by the way it's people of every
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:13.280]  race color creed which makes the media so mad absolutely absolutely and the media coverage
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:19.600]  stinks and you know there's a chapter in here chapter 47 media magic or how to make a story
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:26.160]  disappear and i'll bet you that most people who are watching have no idea that i filed a riko
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:34.000]  lawsuit against billy clinton and his cohorts back in what 1998 a federal riko lawsuit no one knows
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.520]  that you know why media magic how to make a story disappear and billy filed a motion in federal
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:46.080]  district court saying that he should not have to answer this case because he was a sitting president
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:51.440]  and the district court said sorry bubba you got to answer and he took it to the federal appeals
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:55.360]  court and they said the same thing we don't care if you're the sitting president this is a federal
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:47:59.600]  lawsuit you need to answer and he took it all the way to the united states supreme court and what
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:06.000]  do you think the supreme's ruled unanimously in my favor and then lisa meyer of nbc who did that
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.840]  fabulous intense interview with one eat a project about the rate called me and wanted to interview me
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:17.680]  on the steps of the federal courthouse in washington okay great lisa called me the night before and
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:21.760]  she said dolly i'm sorry we have to cancel the interview in the morning that's how the executives
[02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:25.760]  kill it they have a blockade on nanny williams his illegitimate son reportedly they have a
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:30.000]  media blockade and all this other stuff look at red report dot com right now you're a tv viewer
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:34.640]  radio listeners can go there red report dot com obama claimed executive privilege at hillary
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:39.760]  mess now we know it's come out in the emails they never told us he declared it but now it's
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:45.120]  confirmed the white house declared it he had a gnome to plume a fake name that's what the head
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:50.080]  of the you know epa had to step down for communicating with hillary working on all these
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:55.120]  deals outside of the freedom of information act so they're running clandestine operations against
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:49:01.600]  this country meanwhile shock poll no sign of allegation fall out yet there's a whole bunch
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:09.040]  of polls this is rasmussen though it's not hurting trump he's really way ahead so what does your gut
[02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:14.880]  tell you dolly kyle author of hillary the other woman what are they gonna pull there's a smart
[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:18.880]  lady that knows these people as constitutional lawyer been around a while what's your gut telling
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:24.320]  us i feel like 24 days out we were just hurtling towards disaster i mean these arrogant crazy
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:28.960]  disconnected the hillary can hardly go downstairs she has seizures she's all whacked out he's got
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:35.040]  handlers sending emails about wet work you know scalia i mean we've entered the twilight zone
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:40.480]  don't they get we're not backing down they just don't know they're like a 100 ton freight train
[02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:46.960]  going up because of 500 ton freight train well alex the whole thing is mind boggling because
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:52.080]  if you believe about the voting machines and the way they can be tampered and if you believe

[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:51.280]  tried to silence me on bill clinton's right but now they're saying they fear for their lives
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:58.080]  we got podesta talking about wet work in emails now before scalia dies okay so here it is you saw
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:10.240]  bill clinton weeks later yes that was still in this period of shock and wondering what had happened
[02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:15.920]  and how i could have been so stupid to have allowed something like that to happen still blaming
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:23.680]  yourself still blaming myself i'm just still blaming myself and i realized that i have information
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:29.120]  that needs to go back to the campaign because i had not returned to the volunteering and you
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:35.680]  know putting yard signs up asking for donations and things like that so i found about three to
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:41.760]  four checks to the clinton campaign they weren't but for 25 or 50 dollars they were small checks
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:48.960]  and then uh some lists of people who were still going to donate so i asked norma that was the lady
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:53.520]  that was with me at the time if she would run up to that event with me and i think she's the one
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:57:01.520]  that went with me and we went up there uh before long before the fundraiser was to happen this was
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:09.120]  a fundraiser in the home of a local dentist yes um for bill clinton running for governor right did
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:13.680]  you know that he was going to come and that he was going to show up with hillary oh i'm i'm sure
[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:19.040]  that i knew that but that's why we went 30 minutes early so i could give the lady from little rock
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:24.480]  the checks and the list and then we were going to get out of there and they come in early from the
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:31.040]  kitchen area and uh just before they do they would be bill and hillary bill and hillary clinton
[02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:36.480]  and just before they do a gentleman who had driven them from the airport comes straight over to me
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:43.040]  he was a very he was supporting clinton but he didn't know what had happened to me even though he
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:50.400]  was a friend and he said the topic of the conversation all the way from the airport was about you
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:57.120]  and that startled me and i knew i had to get out of there well just as he moved here comes hillary
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:04.880]  straight for me and starts gets to me and she starts saying i just want to thank you for everything
[02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:11.520]  you're doing in bill's campaign and it's so nice to meet you and all of these things so i just nodded
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:18.080]  and told my friend let's go and i thought somebody from behind had grabbed a hold of my arm but it
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:26.560]  was her she grabbed a hold of my arm and my hand and she pulls me into her and she says with this
[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:33.920]  very angry look on her face which had been so pleasant seconds before and in a low voice says
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:37.440]  do you understand everything you do
[02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:46.480]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:33.840]  hearts alex of the resistance talk radio was the original internet because you could call
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:38.720]  in to it it was uncensored to a great extent it was long form it was hard to have teleprompter
[03:00:38.720 --> 03:00:44.000]  heads in there and it sort of getting really popular by the 70s so they passed laws to not
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:48.400]  let there be political views which of course it was all just liberal garbage then by the late 80s
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:53.440]  they got rid of the fairness doctrine you saw the return of talk radio fusing with the internet
[03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:59.680]  right as it was being popularized it was born obviously in the 60s and so this format of talk
[03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:06.960]  radio slash film slash live feeds fusing with the internet is the future and we've been doing it for
[03:01:07.520 --> 03:01:11.760]  i've been doing this style show for at least 15 16 years we were the first i'm not bragging we
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:16.400]  did it through necessity just to reach people i was a radio host who wanted to do internet tv
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:23.600]  we've done it and i'm very honored to be here history's happening and very few people actually get
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:28.160]  what's happening in the media that it's not about your abc your mbc your fox it's about
[03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:32.480]  you put out your analysis you link to other people you pick up this feed you pick up that
[03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:36.880]  feed you dip into lots of different things and get different perspectives and get outside the
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:42.800]  bubble google wants to make it all about they keep you in your little plantation your little niche
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:47.200]  and they feed you what you think you want and then control you and they've got all these algorithms
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:50.720]  out saying they're giving it it's come out in the wiki leaks to obama and they're targeting the
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:56.000]  undecided you know 10 million voters to turn them for killery well those are the undecided that don't
[03:01:56.000 --> 03:02:01.840]  just accept the google results they're hoping you just accept whatever you're given instead of
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:07.200]  looking at google looking at yahoo looking at ap looking at drudge looking at world net daily
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:12.000]  looking at info wars looking at your email feed looking at what people are sending you on facebook
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:18.000]  looking at what's on twitter uh reading what's in the local paper uh shoot a video off local pbs of
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:22.960]  something happening and then talk about it yourself that's how you add new content that the globalists
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:29.120]  don't centralize they just put out their big centralize reports and then they just hope that
[03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:35.360]  we debate that little area instead of i never did this on purpose i would take some police state
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:40.320]  story or some corruption stories and i would i would talk about it on radio and make it national
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:45.840]  back when even most talk show hosts would just cover national stuff very rarely would they cover
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:51.600]  something somewhere that happened and i early on was like why don't people do this but i noticed
[03:02:51.600 --> 03:02:58.160]  drudge was doing drudge was starting uh you know well dominating by the time i got on air in like
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:03.280]  95 96 and i just remember like oh yeah there's local stories and things this is interesting
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:08.080]  so it's kind of a breaking up the monopoly of who sets the table and who sets the menu

[03:04:30.960 --> 03:04:35.360]  in what she does it you know it takes somebody really evil even with our corrupt government
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:38.960]  and our corrupt agencies and there are problems obviously to totally turn against her the whole

[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:20.720]  has stopped circulating water following a powerful 7.3 offshore earthquake this week
[03:05:20.720 --> 03:05:25.920]  tepco said that it managed to restart the system some 90 minutes after its failure and the cooling
[03:05:25.920 --> 03:05:31.360]  system servicing the unit 3 spent fuel pool was not able to circulate water to cool nuclear fuel
[03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:36.560]  because of a broken pump all of this is according to the nuclear regulatory agency it turns out
[03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:41.520]  that this plant for the second time has been hit and the immediate danger although the agency
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:46.560]  admitted gradual rising temperatures the exact cause of this cooling system stoppage is currently

[03:06:08.080 --> 03:06:13.840]  decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:18.960]  iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water
[03:06:18.960 --> 03:06:24.640]  they took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened
[03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:30.080]  as it still is worsening today i was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family now in
[03:06:30.080 --> 03:06:36.080]  2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and
[03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:42.480]  the gut which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine
[03:06:42.480 --> 03:06:47.200]  you can pull these studies up for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine
[03:06:47.200 --> 03:06:53.280]  is essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival shield x2 today

[03:07:01.760 --> 03:07:08.320]  bottle of it rob do designs us you worked i guess like 20 plus hours tell us what brain force get
[03:07:08.320 --> 03:07:13.680]  i've been working all day i took a couple hours off coaching basketball i get in here at 8 30
[03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:17.440]  i was kind of run down you know i just didn't feel like i was going to make it and i really
[03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:21.440]  wanted to do a good job on the interview i got my bottle of brain force right there i popped two of
[03:07:21.440 --> 03:07:26.640]  them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing everything just kind of clears up got four and
[03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:32.240]  a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give
[03:07:32.240 --> 03:07:38.080]  it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your
[03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:41.760]  socks off i haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while but i probably could not have done it
[03:07:41.760 --> 03:07:47.120]  without brain force i went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up took
[03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:52.560]  two more brain force and came in you will find brain force and other game changing products

[03:08:01.200 --> 03:08:09.040]  the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it must be followed
[03:08:09.040 --> 03:08:14.880]  there's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for
[03:08:14.880 --> 03:08:21.360]  launching nuclear weapons to do so as president i will make it clear that the united states will
[03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:28.560]  treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic
[03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:34.960]  and military responses they're voting for peace on planet earth if they vote for trump but if
[03:08:34.960 --> 03:08:44.400]  they vote for hillary it's war we came we saw he died with her you'll end up in world wars
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:49.440]  i want the iranians to know that if i'm the president we will attack iran right now senator
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:54.080]  for us to control all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:09:02.400]  against syria and russia the u.s. military has just raised the threat level to death con too
[03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:08.320]  meanwhile hillary clinton is still threatening russia with military action following unconfirmed
[03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:13.520]  reports of further hacking it's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions of course
[03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:20.880]  not because she's really loud noise all right looks like we're having a little bit of technical
[03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:30.000]  difficulties we'll try to get leon back on in a few minutes when the president gives the order
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:45.920]  it must be followed
[03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:53.840]  so
[03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:03.680]  the door to the tabulating room has been closed and the two pristine brothers are in there
[03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:09.840]  without any observers whatsoever and that is not okay
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:18.080]  i mean i can't keep your switching off computers they just took one in and now they're taking
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:22.000]  another one out i don't know why would a piece of glass
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:28.480]  all right hold on they're taking computers out of the bend the guy with the fist thing is now
[03:10:28.480 --> 03:10:41.680]  walking away this is
[03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:46.240]  beth Harris i've been on air 21 years i've interviewed you probably 30 times over the years
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:51.280]  i've never been this blown away watching the video it's on screen right now for radio listeners
[03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:56.960]  they can go to info wars dot com it's in the article how america's elections are being hacked
[03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:04.720]  missing link discovered this is just so bombshell or just go to blackboxvoting.org fraction magic is
[03:11:04.720 --> 03:11:10.400]  the top story they're on the left get this video from youtube and make it go super viral uh where
[03:11:10.400 --> 03:11:18.160]  should we begin well you know uh we found some new information and i i think it's the the missing
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:24.240]  piece uh that we didn't have before a gentleman by the name of benny smith out of memphis tennessee
[03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:32.400]  um discovered what i would characterize as a master key which essentially lets one person
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:37.920]  control with invisibly and with remarkable precision down to the precinct level and down
[03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:43.440]  to the type of voting early voting and so forth or whatever type they want uh many different
[03:11:43.440 --> 03:11:50.800]  locations at once multiple counties and multiple states it has actually been in the system uh since
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:59.520]  it it is put in the system in 2001 but it was it came into wide use in 2006 but it kind of took
[03:11:59.520 --> 03:12:06.720]  someone with a special set of skills to know what to look for uh he didn't just like do like most of
[03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:12.640]  the people did where he says well let me just look at the program and see what i think he is a guy who
[03:12:12.640 --> 03:12:21.360]  has some background in political forecasting and so forth and he knew uh what would be needed he
[03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:26.720]  kind of went let me design what i think would be needed in order to succeed with widespread
[03:12:26.720 --> 03:12:32.560]  election fraud and after he did that he went now let me see if the pieces that i know are necessary
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:39.920]  are built into the system they should not be and he was amazed when he found after looking at the
[03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:49.840]  files that the pieces were built in to commit very large-scale fraud using a feature that had been
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:54.400]  very little known before and so there's this one central computer which at the end of the day all
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:58.640]  the votes come to it that's where you take it you know run around to five thousand different
[03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:04.080]  things increase things you wait till the votes come to you and then you have your way with them
[03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:11.280]  and it's very very precise it's invisible and there's absolute it doesn't matter whether the
[03:13:11.280 --> 03:13:16.080]  system's on the internet or not none of the stuff that they say is the protection matters at all
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:21.760]  you have your way with them um then you once you control the votes in whatever way you want
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:27.440]  for whatever target you want um you know the election is done now there is something new
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:32.720]  that can be done and this is really exciting because um it's kind of scaring the pants off of
[03:13:32.720 --> 03:13:38.720]  them actually um and at the very end of the video i make sort of a cryptic reference to it but
[03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:45.440]  we didn't realize that more than half of the voting machines in the country now take a picture of
[03:13:45.440 --> 03:13:51.920]  every ballot even the touchscreen machines that supposedly have no paper are keeping an image
[03:13:51.920 --> 03:13:56.960]  of every ballot but now think about this you're on a paper ballot through and it takes a picture of
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:02.080]  it and that's just an electronic file right that you should be able to get that under public
[03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:08.240]  records request right it's just a file and you ought to be able to get all those images in fact
[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:12.560]  there was one county in california that was putting all those on the web why not when they
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:17.600]  put them all on the web guess what happened everybody looked and found out there was a
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:22.640]  whole precinct that never got counted at all by the machine um yeah so i mean essentially
[03:14:23.440 --> 03:14:31.200]  these ballot images are and must be public record and people must ask for them now let me
[03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:35.840]  tell you what happened when a gentleman from arizona asked for them he said okay i went under my
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:39.840]  freedom of information right i went all your ballot images basically you can do your own
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:45.600]  recount that way right and we did find that they do not succumb to the fraction magic attack well
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:51.680]  when he asked for them they said oh uh well uh we destroy them every day man i know you never
[03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:55.680]  like it but let me tell you something i mean i interviewed the other vote product experts that
[03:14:55.680 --> 03:14:58.800]  were before you the college brothers and others and they died and their daughters she's great
[03:14:58.800 --> 03:15:03.920]  and and other folks i'm just saying you are so dynamic you've done with your crew and and the
[03:15:03.920 --> 03:15:08.400]  folks 10 times what anybody else ever did so that's why i single you out because you're amazing
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:16.240]  and you're such a treasure all right that's a boil down of the exclusive bev harris breaking news
[03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:21.760]  yesterday it's so huge only drudge report has picked it up and a few other uh liberty based
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:26.640]  outlets it's gotten millions and millions of readers and viewers but you'd think national news
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:31.520]  that has had her with hbo documentaries and she's been all over seeing in fox she's been everywhere
[03:15:32.400 --> 03:15:37.760]  as the consulate expert she discovers the biggest news of her 20 year research into this
[03:15:38.320 --> 03:15:43.440]  she was a former top federal fraud investigator before that and there's been no coverage so far
[03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:47.360]  maybe since i got on air there has been we should google that or search engine that
[03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:51.360]  but that is such a big video that's the boil down of the hour interview we're going to be posting
[03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:58.240]  that the next hour or so dmpholwars.com now joining us for the next 45 minutes in studio
[03:15:58.240 --> 03:16:02.400]  we're also going to do some tape interviews with us for the nightly news are kathy shelton and kandace
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:09.680]  jackson and kandace jackson is is is a graduate of honors from stanford university a lawyer
[03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:15.120]  i'm not going to get into her whole her whole background but she's just a great lady they're
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:20.720]  not seeking anything right now from bill clinton they're not out to even get anybody here they're
[03:16:20.720 --> 03:16:26.800]  not out to get hillary clinton uh they're just talking about the reality of what happened to her
[03:16:26.800 --> 03:16:32.480]  when she was a 12 year old girl so long ago when hillary clinton was a young lawyer and so they're
[03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:37.040]  just seeking for the public to be aware of this now we've played the tapes we'll play them later
[03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:42.960]  i know it's hard for for kathy to listen to if hillary making jokes about uh the man that reportedly
[03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:47.520]  who she got off but uh raped her when she was 12 years old and she was in a coma for days and
[03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:51.360]  that's not disputed hillary laughs that she knew he was guilty but you know he took a lot of
[03:16:51.360 --> 03:16:55.920]  tech and passed it so destroyed her confidence a lot of techers it just shows the true mindset
[03:16:55.920 --> 03:17:02.400]  the predatory nature of what we're dealing with their lives foundation dot net their lives
[03:17:02.400 --> 03:17:08.000]  foundation dot net and again kandace jackson is her lawyer just on her own dime here doing this
[03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:12.560]  because she cares about women's issues and justice uh kathy and kandace thank you so much for joining
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:21.040]  us thank you uh wow um you know so much to cover so much to talk about uh i'm gonna skip this breaks
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:26.880]  we have more time because i got too late playing those clips why are you here first for me i mean
[03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:30.480]  for tv viewers and radio listeners i mean i think i kind of describe what you talked about on your
[03:17:30.480 --> 03:17:34.400]  foundation site when i've heard you say i know you're you are at the debates mr trump had you
[03:17:34.400 --> 03:17:40.320]  there i mean uh why are you speaking out now because your case is documented it's it's a fact
[03:17:40.320 --> 03:17:48.240]  what happened to you why are you speaking out uh because um hillary's on tape last man saying that
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:58.720]  she knows that they're guilty and has made some other remarks and uh down the line and um i'm
[03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:06.640]  standing up for what's right for me because i know it happened and um she's trying to make me look
[03:18:06.640 --> 03:18:13.760]  like a liar and that i asked for it and all that and and by the way we should pull up a photo of you
[03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:18.080]  when you were 12 that's that's online people can also go to their lives foundation dot net we can
[03:18:18.080 --> 03:18:23.120]  put that website on screen for people so we can personalize this i mean you were a little girl
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:28.240]  i have a 12 year old daughter i have an eight year old daughter and you know before i had daughters
[03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:32.480]  and children i would get upset hearing about abuse of women and children but now i mean i'm
[03:18:32.480 --> 03:18:40.320]  going to be honest it makes me just start feeling very violent whenever i think about people abusing
[03:18:40.320 --> 03:18:47.200]  little girls especially and i think what can't be underestimated is you take a case like this and the
[03:18:47.200 --> 03:18:54.640]  level of violence it this was rape is always for a horrible crime this was no ordinary rape uh he
[03:18:55.680 --> 03:19:01.600]  beat and almost murdered this little girl so badly she was in a coma for five days so you
[03:19:01.600 --> 03:19:07.680]  top that off with there being absolutely zero justice for the victim kathy in this case and
[03:19:07.680 --> 03:19:13.600]  that's makes it a double tragedy and and that was deliberately designed and pulled off by hillary
[03:19:13.600 --> 03:19:21.360]  clinton again kandace jackson uh tell folks why you've gotten involved and then just encapsulate
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:26.800]  the case and we'll get into the personal things that uh uh you know kathy's gone through but kandace
[03:19:26.800 --> 03:19:31.280]  looking at this i mean what makes you a busy person run your own law firm very successful all these
[03:19:31.280 --> 03:19:36.080]  big letters to your name uh kandacee jackson dot com what makes you spend so much time and energy
[03:19:36.080 --> 03:19:41.760]  on this and then break down the nuts and bolts of the case well you know i i i have over the years
[03:19:41.760 --> 03:19:46.400]  writing about it speaking about it gotten to know some of the women who have accused bill
[03:19:46.400 --> 03:19:54.240]  clinton of sexual abuse very well and i realized this year that kathy's story is one that it's so
[03:19:54.800 --> 03:20:00.800]  different it's so unique it really does represent the epitome of the type of corruption that hillary
[03:20:00.800 --> 03:20:05.360]  clinton practices has nothing to do with her husband bill clinton has everything to do with
[03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:11.680]  her choices hillary's own choices and decisions to bend and break rules ignore protocol and procedures
[03:20:12.320 --> 03:20:16.960]  cheat the system rig the system to get an outcome that she wants and by the way we now learn about
[03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:24.400]  tim kane he would cry when horrible rapists and killers and people he was unable to get him off
[03:20:24.400 --> 03:20:29.920]  and he he said he enjoyed it he and there's these videos of him acting really weird it's like some
[03:20:29.920 --> 03:20:35.840]  type of celebration it's like who are these people well you look at hillary clinton's career and it
[03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:41.600]  baffles me so much that she has a that she has been allowed mostly by our mainstream press and to
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:47.440]  the shame of her own party to somehow be held up as some kind of champion for women and fighter for
[03:20:47.440 --> 03:20:52.480]  for justice for children through 40 years of her career when time after time she's chosen the side
[03:20:52.480 --> 03:20:58.720]  of rapists just to make herself look good win this case put into practice principles of liberal
[03:20:58.720 --> 03:21:03.840]  philosophy with regard to criminal policy let's not lock them up it's not really the criminals fault
[03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:07.440]  let's get them back out on the street i'll tell you what counselor there for tv viewers there's
[03:21:07.440 --> 03:21:11.840]  camera too i mean layout this is a fact i mean lay out what happened in this case to people
[03:21:11.840 --> 03:21:16.000]  and a kathy you know right over there you're staring at folks in tv land anytime you want to jump in
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:21.120]  and and and talk to talk to hillary clinton you know talk to the media because they can't deny your
[03:21:21.120 --> 03:21:25.280]  case i mean it's so powerful and they're trying to take stuff with trump and blow it out of proportion
[03:21:25.280 --> 03:21:30.800]  fine if they ever got in trouble then we could talk about trump was something 50 times less 100
[03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:36.320]  times less it's the hypocrisy so so so counselor you're talking to the viewers out there the hypocrisy
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:41.760]  is astounding you've got somebody out there who claims to be an early feminist a fighter and defender
[03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:48.880]  and champion for for women and and children that's her main pitch for herself is i'm a woman uh vote
[03:21:48.880 --> 03:21:53.360]  for me to put the first woman in office i've spent my life defending children and here's what she did
[03:21:53.360 --> 03:22:02.080]  in this case her defenders will say she was court appointed she had no choice uh she had to accept
[03:22:02.080 --> 03:22:09.200]  this case and then an attorney has to defend her client wrong hillary clinton has been lying about
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:15.200]  this case her entire career in her autobiography she lies about how and why she accepted this case
[03:22:15.200 --> 03:22:20.160]  in the audio taped interviews that exist when she chooses to talk about this case to a journalist
[03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:26.400]  she's lying she was not a public defender she was not required by any judge to accept this
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:32.960]  appointment she knew that the victim in this case was a was a sixth grade rape victim she chose to
[03:22:32.960 --> 03:22:40.400]  take the side of the rapist most likely because she the judge and the judges barely law school
[03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:46.000]  graduate son were all supporters and donors of bill clinton for congress at the time they all
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:52.640]  shared a liberal philosophy about uh programs like work release for criminals which hillary and the
[03:22:52.640 --> 03:23:00.000]  judge uh released this criminal for work after reducing bail in this case from $50,000 to just
[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:09.520]  $2,500 and then hillary clinton went on to use the most vicious blame the victim tactics that i have
[03:23:09.520 --> 03:23:15.520]  ever seen in a case much less put forward by some kind of feminist i was about to say
[03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:19.360]  you're studying this it's one thing if you're a defense lawyer and you give people a good show and
[03:23:19.360 --> 03:23:24.560]  you you you give them a fair shake even if you know they're guilty she was glee and and every dirty
[03:23:24.560 --> 03:23:29.440]  trick and pouring it on stuff that i think i'm not a constitutional lawyer like you but i've studied
[03:23:29.440 --> 03:23:35.360]  it uh really you know could get somebody disbarred in a lot of counties oh well here's the the types
[03:23:35.360 --> 03:23:43.920]  of tactics that she chose to use uh in this case she made up lies wholesale about kathy and her
[03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:50.320]  family she said that kathy was uh fantasizing about older men and before we go there why don't
[03:23:50.320 --> 03:23:53.520]  you recap what happened i mean i know it's hard for kathy to talk about but and maybe you should
[03:23:54.960 --> 03:23:57.840]  kathy do you want to tell folks this just you know look at the camera over there and tell
[03:23:57.840 --> 03:24:05.040]  folks what happened to you um i was riding my bicycle to or going a couple blocks riding my
[03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:13.680]  bicycle over the church and my mother really didn't want me to but she let me and said after church
[03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:21.040]  she'd pick me up in the bicycle um i talked her into it because it was still daylight
[03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:28.720]  because she always worried about me but um it was like a couple blocks away on the way over there
[03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:37.680]  um this truck stopped um two men got out of it started coming towards me and scared me really
[03:24:37.680 --> 03:24:44.880]  bad and um they told me i was going with them and i said no i'm not i try to get away but i couldn't
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:53.760]  they jerked me off my bicycle they put me in the truck they um started ripping my clothes off of
[03:24:53.760 --> 03:25:01.840]  me i was screaming and crying trying to hold her for help and it was like no one heard me we go out
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:08.640]  on a road somewhere just this plumb feels i don't remember what road it is today
[03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:18.880]  i remember all the fields and they were beating me they and right and they raped me and he was
[03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:30.480]  saying he knew i liked it except in a more terribly manner than that um i um was left out on the ground
[03:25:30.480 --> 03:25:40.960]  barely conscious uh some sometimes at one time i was unconscious i crawled to a porch out of nowhere
[03:25:40.960 --> 03:25:47.040]  i don't know where the house was or how i made it there but they thought they had killed me and
[03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:54.800]  they were coming back for me and the lady at the porch i crawled at turned her porch light on
[03:25:54.800 --> 03:26:02.800]  and it scared him back off and she got their tag number and that's how they caught him today and
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:07.520]  i well a girl beat in a field and reportedly you were in a coma for what five days yes i woke up
[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:14.800]  in the hospital five days later out of a coma and was told that i couldn't 99 chance i couldn't
[03:26:14.800 --> 03:26:23.200]  have kids and i had several stitches down in my private area now now i've read some about this
[03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:27.200]  but correct me if i'm wrong these were like kind of the cool good old boys or something so i guess
[03:26:27.200 --> 03:26:30.960]  they kind of got special treatment and then they must have been crazy good old boys who think you
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:37.520]  could rape a little girl out the middle of a field and then get your tags you know documented and
[03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:43.840]  still not you basically fry for it but you know to be honest there there's still a lot of unanswered
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:50.000]  questions and a lot unknown about the the background of this case we've been working very hard at their
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:57.600]  lives foundation on on as a pure act of love to try to uncover facts around this case it's not easy
[03:26:57.600 --> 03:27:03.600]  to do not surprisingly in a case like this that the clintons would prefer remain buried and hidden
[03:27:03.600 --> 03:27:10.800]  lots of records have disappeared this is now 41 years ago the suspect who was 41 years old at the
[03:27:10.800 --> 03:27:17.600]  time died in 1992 i've spoken to family members of him there's a lot of vagueness about what his
[03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:23.040]  life was like what he went on to do etc so there's there's a lot of information missing about this
[03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:28.000]  case and that's part of why we are digging hard to pull together the true sure sure well a lot of
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:31.520]  the left has made a big deal about rape culture and god i know it goes on but then they they
[03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:36.880]  projected onto like you know stuff where it's very vague and and maybe she you know had had too much
[03:27:36.880 --> 03:27:41.440]  to drink and she didn't know okay fine whatever that's bad don't do it but when people are beating
[03:27:41.440 --> 03:27:45.920]  and raping 12 year old girls and ripping their bodies up and putting them in commas i have daughters
[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:51.040]  i'm not i mean i seriously it makes me so angry i don't usually shoot my mouth off about you know
[03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:56.480]  being addresses but if this i just i just can't see how hillary and the judge and the town and
[03:27:56.480 --> 03:28:04.560]  everybody just didn't care i mean they were just throwing you away yes sir there was and um she uh
[03:28:05.360 --> 03:28:13.200]  has raised now today is telling stories like uh it was a family member um and i've said they can
[03:28:13.200 --> 03:28:21.040]  check my family history he's not no family member because they asked me to get in the truck uh offered
[03:28:21.040 --> 03:28:30.640]  me a coke to get in and that that is not true um i've heard several different stories now there's
[03:28:30.640 --> 03:28:36.000]  just all kinds of stories going around that's not true we all know how it works in arkansas
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:41.600]  in some areas of texas money gets paid people get off sure and i think that there was a legitimate
[03:28:41.600 --> 03:28:47.440]  divide not every single uh person involved with this case was happy and pleased about the fact
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:53.520]  that a violent criminal in their community went free uh but people like the judge and the judge's
[03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:59.120]  son and even the prosecutor to some extent were on the democrat liberal side of things philosophically
[03:28:59.120 --> 03:29:05.120]  and truly believe that rehabilitation should should trump punishment uh and maybe it's not
[03:29:05.120 --> 03:29:08.960]  criminals fault that they act this way and we have the audio hillary we've played it many times
[03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:12.160]  we'll probably play when we come back admitting she knew he was guilty she couldn't believe it
[03:29:12.160 --> 03:29:16.080]  that if he passed a lot of texture which destroyed her faith a lot of takers then laughs about it
[03:29:16.080 --> 03:29:19.200]  and and again it's not just one she she got kicked off the watergate committee for false
[03:29:19.200 --> 03:29:24.240]  applying stuff she her whole life is like doing evil things when doing good would have been better
[03:29:24.240 --> 03:29:29.200]  for you would think so why would she stand up and try to get this rapist off when she could have
[03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:34.000]  joined the the the side of the victim and spoken up like some early gloria all right on the side
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:39.280]  of the victim but no she chooses the side of the rapist every time and now her and michelle want to
[03:29:39.280 --> 03:29:43.680]  get up and be all breathless about Donald Trump and oh they're so scared and so we'll be right back
[03:29:43.680 --> 03:29:50.640]  with both of our guests i'm alex jones in full wars dot com stay with us we're on the march the

[03:30:06.720 --> 03:30:11.120]  have an article that's up on our website info wars dot com and aggregated from cns news it talks
[03:30:11.120 --> 03:30:15.360]  about how trump characterized the move a part of a plan to advance the simple core principle of
[03:30:15.360 --> 03:30:20.240]  quote putting america first of course that's been his credo down with globalism the entire campaign
[03:30:20.240 --> 03:30:24.480]  and now that president elect donald trump who set on money that his first day in office next

[03:30:33.600 --> 03:30:38.720]  now the obama administration wanted to rebalance to asia but trump called that a horrible idea he's
[03:30:38.720 --> 03:30:43.200]  saying in an online video message that one of his top priorities in the first 100 days is to ask
[03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:48.320]  his transition team to quote develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to restore
[03:30:48.320 --> 03:30:53.440]  our laws and bring back our jobs it's about time when he echoes a sentiment that every day americans

[03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:45.120]  media and the think tanks and the lobbyists are lined up against donald trump they came out with
[03:33:45.120 --> 03:33:50.640]  this outrageous claim that no one would run with for months i mean we'd even seen it floating around
[03:33:50.640 --> 03:33:56.080]  that they had tracked some server they could easily they were really smart to get into one of his
[03:33:56.080 --> 03:33:59.920]  hundreds of hotels and things and actually make a link and create a false flag but they don't even
[03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:05.760]  do that they go oh we have chatter between a russian server and uh and uh trump even the new
[03:34:05.760 --> 03:34:11.600]  york timeshed it's total bull turned out it came out the new york times today drudge at the big
[03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:20.160]  headline that they have been inside investigating trump the fbi has with warrants everything digging
[03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:25.680]  this way kept saying i'm under an audit right now i can't tell you see trump didn't tell you they
[03:34:25.680 --> 03:34:29.520]  edited the belly bush tape it's totally you could hear it but then now it's it's gonna come out after
[03:34:29.520 --> 03:34:33.200]  the after the whole deal uh because he knows the public will think he's looking like a wimp if he
[03:34:33.200 --> 03:34:36.480]  you know sits there and doesn't just apologize and i'm saying what he did was perfect billy bush
[03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:40.560]  goes actually i goad him for an hour to tell me sex stories and then he edited i mean that's what
[03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:46.880]  they got but the point is is that hillary's the one with a secret server to the russians but
[03:34:46.880 --> 03:34:52.800]  dest is the one everything they do they didn't accuse us of they accused me of being a russian
[03:34:52.800 --> 03:35:01.840]  agent they kind of by bushka means a baby uh i think uh gulosh means like that good like soup
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:06.000]  you know like hash meat i mean i mean i don't know anything about russians i want to go to
[03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:10.480]  russia someday i think i hear it's really neat to see it's historical i've read history books about
[03:35:10.480 --> 03:35:16.160]  it but i mean it's just like i'm sitting here defending the republic just trying to sustain
[03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:21.680]  our country and get some tax cuts so we get our economy going i mean call the russian agent
[03:35:21.680 --> 03:35:28.480]  america is rejecting all of this big time and i've never gotten into a campaign like this because
[03:35:28.480 --> 03:35:33.280]  i was usually you know mccain obama and you know now this is so clear
[03:35:35.520 --> 03:35:39.520]  this is such an incredible time to be alive just to repudiate the entire system
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:42.720]  doesn't mean we're going to be on some bed of roses after that absolutely not we're going back to

[03:39:12.800 --> 03:39:17.040]  beforehand we didn't script that press conference you just saw we're just taking action rolling our
[03:39:17.040 --> 03:39:23.040]  sleeves up and doing the best job we can so kandace jackson again a lawyer just free of charge doing
[03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:28.080]  this i'm doing a great job with kathy shelton the 12 year old but she was a rape victim by a whole
[03:39:28.080 --> 03:39:33.760]  bunch of men uh in a coma for five days her body torn apart their lives foundation dot net we put
[03:39:33.760 --> 03:39:38.960]  up images of you when you were 12 and what happened kandace recapping this and why it's such a
[03:39:38.960 --> 03:39:44.160]  miscarriage of justice and then anytime kathy you want to pop in and then we've got leon macadoo
[03:39:44.160 --> 03:39:48.560]  who i drug in here because i'm she's really hot about this case she's angry about it and i am too
[03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:54.320]  too well people should be angry about this case it is unbelievable the hypocrisy that
[03:39:54.320 --> 03:40:00.160]  hillary clinton is getting away with to uh have this reputation and and self promotion as as a
[03:40:00.160 --> 03:40:05.840]  defender of women and children's rights activist and then deliberately voluntarily choose to take
[03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:11.520]  the side of a child rapist here and do not only everything within the bounds of legal ethics and
[03:40:11.520 --> 03:40:17.040]  law to get him off that would be bad enough that she chose to do that and be on his side
[03:40:17.040 --> 03:40:23.680]  but in order to win her case in order to look good in order to prove that she can win
[03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:29.920]  she bent the rules she went outside proper procedure she violated court orders uh these
[03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:35.280]  are things that were uncovering by the day in this case because hey guess what the mainstream media
[03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:40.800]  has never bothered to do it they've taken hillary clinton's previous explanations and descriptions
[03:40:40.800 --> 03:40:45.680]  of this case at face value and never challenged a bit of it and we are unraveling everything
[03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:50.080]  she has ever said about this case and it turns out most of it's what i don't get is it's actually
[03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:54.480]  the old newspaper articles i've been research on this they admit you got right this happened
[03:40:54.480 --> 03:40:59.360]  they admit you got grabbed the truck and taken off a bunch of 40 year old men drag a 12 year old
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:04.160]  off in a truck to a field i say execute every one of them you know i mean this is so obvious
[03:41:04.160 --> 03:41:10.320]  how the hell did this happen with this democrat judge in all this and and it's just everything
[03:41:10.320 --> 03:41:16.080]  she just gets away with everything yeah there is a handwritten notation in in the court record
[03:41:16.080 --> 03:41:22.080]  this judge has a history we've learned and uncovered of being pro work release for criminals for
[03:41:22.080 --> 03:41:29.040]  example get this he hand wrote a notation in the court order no objection to release to work
[03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:34.560]  during the day so even the the very little time few months that this creep actually spent in jail
[03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:38.080]  he was released during the day to go to work you know where his workplace was
[03:41:38.080 --> 03:41:44.560]  was a five minute walk away from Kathy Shelton's house what kind of judge agrees to do that and
[03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:50.240]  what kind of defense attorney asks for that in the first place so whatever ended up happening
[03:41:50.240 --> 03:41:55.120]  well i mean i'm not about the ruling and stuff yeah well yeah i mean in the end hillary clinton
[03:41:55.120 --> 03:42:00.880]  monkeyed around with the evidence manipulated the system enough to argue that there wasn't
[03:42:00.880 --> 03:42:05.200]  enough physical evidence to convict the prosecutor rolled over in this case by the way there's zero
[03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:10.800]  evidence that he challenged hillary clinton's unsubstantiated stories about the physical evidence
[03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:16.880]  not being sufficient so between the prosecutor rolling over also a liberal democrat the judge
[03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:23.040]  cooperating and hillary clinton having insider help to to kind of make all of this happen at the
[03:42:23.040 --> 03:42:29.280]  end result was that before jury trial actually occurred a plea plea bargain was reached the guy
[03:42:29.280 --> 03:42:34.320]  pled to a much lesser charge was sentenced to a year in jail but it does not appear that he
[03:42:34.320 --> 03:42:37.920]  actually spent any time in jail that's what i probably should say that up front that's right
[03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:42.800]  you know he he pled to a lesser charge she quote got him off but they admitted i'm trying to deny it
[03:42:42.800 --> 03:42:46.640]  all they've done this and i just can't believe the community didn't didn't lynch these people
[03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:50.160]  because again it's just i've read the old newspaper articles i'm so cutting dry you're
[03:42:50.160 --> 03:42:55.600]  grabbing a 12 year old girl off a bike a bunch of old men i mean you know 40s old i mean it just
[03:42:55.600 --> 03:43:00.800]  makes me absolutely just imagine my daughter's not riding bikes uh and i'm just sorry i'm just
[03:43:00.800 --> 03:43:05.840]  talking about how even this you're not getting a trial just understand that even this perpetrators
[03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:11.280]  family members that i've been able to track down recently uh they they say yeah he moved around a
[03:43:11.280 --> 03:43:16.800]  lot he was kind of hiding from us all he didn't really keep in touch so you know he he must he
[03:43:16.800 --> 03:43:22.160]  knew he knew to hide out but i would not be surprised if the community was up in arms about
[03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:27.600]  this but they could nobody could fight the system when it's being rigged by uh the defense attorney
[03:43:27.600 --> 03:43:33.280]  the prosecutor and the judge unbelievable all right uh kathy shelton i want to bring leon
[03:43:33.280 --> 03:43:38.000]  mackadoo in here because she's covered all the angles of this but uh looking at camera four right
[03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:42.480]  over there uh what is your message to the american people or if you'd like a message to hillary
[03:43:42.480 --> 03:43:47.600]  clinton i mean just this is your chance millions people are watching uh you know you did i mean
[03:43:47.600 --> 03:43:51.200]  this i i can imagine the things happened to me when i was younger nothing like this they scarred
[03:43:51.200 --> 03:43:55.360]  me for life i mean i know i've read the statistics i've seen it but i haven't experienced it what it
[03:43:55.360 --> 03:43:59.760]  can do to somebody's whole life when they're innocent and sweet and not ever having the first
[03:43:59.760 --> 03:44:04.000]  experience of having loving or nice to you just having a bunch of pigs do this to you put you in
[03:44:04.000 --> 03:44:10.400]  a coma uh and then her protective what would you like to say to them um she would do anything to get
[03:44:10.400 --> 03:44:19.920]  to a high spot where she wants to be that includes lying under oath um cheating stealing um if she
[03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:28.480]  was for women she's um she's never showed me any remorse or ever had any words to say to me
[03:44:29.280 --> 03:44:40.080]  since this has happened uh she's always said i'm a liar i'm a liar well um evidence of hospital
[03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:49.760]  records and police records and uh even the underwear that she sent to her crime lab she cut out the
[03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:57.520]  blood evidence and when she sent it to the crime lab there wasn't enough to test because what she
[03:44:57.520 --> 03:45:03.680]  cut out was the part they needed and she was kicked off the watergate thing for for falsifying evidence
[03:45:03.680 --> 03:45:09.120]  too this is a lifelong pattern for her that began at the very beginning of her career and she's
[03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:13.840]  followed it up through her attitudes about setting up a private server and lying and covering up her
[03:45:13.840 --> 03:45:17.760]  activities that way too it's the same pattern Kathy Shelton again continue other thoughts you want to
[03:45:17.760 --> 03:45:22.160]  tell them um what do you want to say to Hillary because i'm gonna blame you she watches camera
[03:45:22.160 --> 03:45:25.920]  i'm gonna say to Hillary all these years later i want to say if this was her daughter that that
[03:45:25.920 --> 03:45:33.760]  happened to and this was her first case for her daughter which she got hurt which she got these
[03:45:33.760 --> 03:45:39.760]  men off which she's a protection from her daughter i don't believe she would have i believe uh she
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:46.480]  would have come forward then because it would have been her daughter but since it was uh somebody
[03:45:46.480 --> 03:45:55.440]  she didn't know at all and i'm nothing to her so you know just like any other women or child
[03:45:55.440 --> 03:46:02.480]  that she says she's for i've heard many times that the hotline she had gone when you called it
[03:46:02.480 --> 03:46:07.120]  the number was supposed to call you back and people didn't get a call back from the number
[03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:14.560]  well look i mean i it's normal to have empathy as a human being i i anybody's daughter is my
[03:46:14.560 --> 03:46:18.960]  daughter or son but these people don't have it now they might care about their family but
[03:46:18.960 --> 03:46:23.440]  only because they see it as some extension of themselves and they're so blind and our societies
[03:46:23.440 --> 03:46:28.800]  used to be run by these really handicapped individuals that are sociopathic yeah emotionally
[03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:33.520]  psychologically empathetically handicapped is a good way to put it there just doesn't seem to be
[03:46:33.520 --> 03:46:39.680]  that i think even if you had defended a guilty client in a horrific situation like this when you
[03:46:39.680 --> 03:46:46.640]  choose to uh describe the case later like hillary clinton did you would think if you have any human
[03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:52.000]  decency in your heart that you would be describing that case starting out by saying this was terrible
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:57.280]  this was but i know i know the lawyers i know instead she laughs and she treats it light heartedly
[03:46:57.280 --> 03:47:01.440]  by the way we have that clever when leon magnus and she mentioned it uh that's a great point uh
[03:47:01.440 --> 03:47:06.000]  here's hillary this is undisputed seen and tried to say this tape's fake hillary admits it's real
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:12.880]  here's hillary you know i'm making jokes here it is of course he quietly did all this stuff
[03:47:12.880 --> 03:47:18.960]  he took a lot of technical tests i have to apologize which he passed forever destroyed my
[03:47:18.960 --> 03:47:28.240]  thank you the you know what was saying about it was that the prosecutors had evidence
[03:47:29.600 --> 03:47:35.840]  among which was his underwear his underwear his underwear which was white
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:47.520]  sent out of prime lab or hill difference was formed in my man prime lab so just a pair of underpants
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:59.600]  now that's hillary bragging journalist she thinks her friends that she cut the blood out of his
[03:47:59.600 --> 03:48:07.120]  underwear her blood and she's getting off on it it's like what freaking planet does this demon
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:11.920]  come from that's the thing in all the wiki leaks which confirms everything you said they get off on
[03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:18.960]  bad where they could do better doing good they don't they want to do that well she talked about
[03:48:18.960 --> 03:48:24.000]  having public positions versus private positions and apparently public position is i need to be
[03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:30.000]  a defender of women and children private position i cut the bloody i cut the blood off his underwear
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.640]  proud i'm proud of getting somebody off like this i just want to win i want to get ahead win and
[03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:38.800]  look good that's that's who she is well i mean most lawyers i know won't even take your case if
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:42.400]  they're good lawyers unless they think you're in the right but then there's these weirdos that get
[03:48:42.400 --> 03:48:46.480]  off on representing bad people uh let's go to leon macado leon we're going to break it when i
[03:48:46.480 --> 03:48:49.760]  hold you through the rest of the interview and i want you to extensive interviews after we flow
[03:48:49.760 --> 03:48:54.320]  him down here i know you're you're on the case i mean what is it like just one more piece but it's
[03:48:54.320 --> 03:48:59.280]  not just like this one case and hillary admitting yeah i covered up the raptor i cut the bloody underwear
[03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:05.680]  out i mean in giggling like a damn demon it's like it's everything it's total proof america
[03:49:05.680 --> 03:49:11.200]  and the world is being shown the proof right i mean just listening to kathy retell her story
[03:49:11.200 --> 03:49:16.640]  about what happened i mean and then to know hillary clinton took this case voluntarily because she
[03:49:16.640 --> 03:49:22.880]  owed a favor to the judge how how does she sleep at night and then you hear her years later laughing
[03:49:22.880 --> 03:49:28.960]  about it and almost so proud of how she was able to manipulate the law and i think i came i saw he
[03:49:28.960 --> 03:49:34.560]  died haha that that's what people need to understand about her is that this was kind of a the foundation
[03:49:34.560 --> 03:49:40.640]  this sets the the precedent for the type of principles that hillary clinton has once again
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:46.000]  here she is on the wrong side of history as kanda says you know time and time again she's taken the
[03:49:46.000 --> 03:49:51.920]  side of rapists throwing the victims under the bus and you know this is the tactic she uses again
[03:49:51.920 --> 03:49:56.400]  and again oh well you want to accuse my husband of sexual assault well i'm going to accuse you of
[03:49:56.400 --> 03:50:01.360]  sexual assault oh i set up an illegal server well guess what you have a server too it's connected
[03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:07.600]  to russia and then she says well i'm a champion of women but behind the scenes she's working tirelessly
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:15.440]  to get off a rapist who raped nearly murdered a sixth grader and she knew he was guilty i've got a
[03:50:15.440 --> 03:50:20.000]  12 year old daughter i'd say this makes me i'm not just saying it for audience you know i actually
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:26.000]  really gets to me pisses me off me too i mean this hillary clinton is pathological just the fact that
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:31.520]  she can if she's a pathological liar that you know my 12 year old daughter i mean can you imagine
[03:50:31.520 --> 03:50:37.200]  anybody 12 year old daughter this happening to no i mean i i was a 12 year old girl i i know what
[03:50:37.200 --> 03:50:43.200]  it feels like so i can't imagine hillary clinton blaming kathy and that she asked for it at 12 years
[03:50:43.200 --> 03:50:48.080]  old as if you have any under understanding of what it is and then ruining somebody's life i would
[03:50:48.080 --> 03:50:50.960]  say to a great extent we'll talk about that with kathy sheltered in the head i mean obviously you've
[03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:54.880]  had a good life but i mean this has got to be dramatic leon stay there we'll be right back

[03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:17.280]  gappy shelter broke down during the break has been sobbing here and um she's been trying to
[03:54:17.280 --> 03:54:22.080]  compose herself uh i know it's hard for her to talk about this but this is this is a real humanity
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:27.680]  of what hillary clinton has done to people and i just can't imagine you know it's one thing for
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:32.320]  bad things to happen but i'm told if justice is done sometimes that that you know provides some
[03:54:32.320 --> 03:54:37.440]  form of relief uh why why when you heard leon talking or i i guess i was talking about what
[03:54:37.440 --> 03:54:41.200]  happens to young girls how it changes their lives you begin to break down as we went to break why
[03:54:41.200 --> 03:54:50.720]  did you break down because um of all the things i read about hillary everything books movies she's
[03:54:50.720 --> 03:54:56.720]  got me in and it's like it's funny it's her first case it's like it's funny it happened to me it
[03:54:56.720 --> 03:55:03.360]  don't mean no remorse to her or nothing and she's supposed to be for women and children but this is
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:12.240]  funny oh i won my first case and you know and it's all funny and all the stuff she's written
[03:55:14.400 --> 03:55:20.080]  that is rubbing it is as the cackling she makes a failed state in libya they kill tens of thousands
[03:55:20.080 --> 03:55:27.200]  almost a hundred thousand people she starts and then she makes jokes about it i mean but even
[03:55:27.200 --> 03:55:31.040]  her own staff admit in the wiki leaks they hate her they can't stand her they say she has horrible
[03:55:31.040 --> 03:55:38.560]  judgment she's they they they call her a demon basically and and someone who's just uh comes
[03:55:38.560 --> 03:55:45.280]  off as a mediocre unlikable candidate in person she doesn't have that human that humanity but
[03:55:45.280 --> 03:55:48.800]  there are corporate interests that want to put her in because she'll do the things nobody else will
[03:55:48.800 --> 03:56:01.280]  you got anything else you'd like to add she she says that um um i went blank i'm sorry no it's
[03:56:01.280 --> 03:56:07.360]  okay it's okay i just and me getting torn down a little bit it's got me kind of going blank but
[03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:12.160]  no i understand well i mean what made you so sad totally made me look she's totally made me look
[03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:19.600]  like i'm a liar and that i've asked for this uh trust me if i could turn all this around um
[03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:28.640]  i would rather it not happen and and and me not have to do go through all this but actually
[03:56:28.640 --> 03:56:35.120]  right now i'm actually kind of being re dramatized again having to get up and tell all this but
[03:56:35.120 --> 03:56:41.920]  you know what somebody's got to stand up and tell the truth because she's right she's just
[03:56:41.920 --> 03:56:50.720]  going to make it you know oh well that was my first case i got off so hey it looks good
[03:56:50.720 --> 03:56:55.920]  and i don't care what happened to her well you're protected other people you're protecting other
[03:56:55.920 --> 03:57:01.280]  people she you've transcended her a thousand times you're helping other people and you're
[03:57:01.280 --> 03:57:06.960]  a human and she's not let's just be honest leon and i want to say one more thing she's also said
[03:57:06.960 --> 03:57:11.680]  that i came from the other side of the tracks ever what that's supposed to mean oh she hates anybody
[03:57:11.680 --> 03:57:16.720]  that's poor or minority she really hates poor people and then she claims she's this big champion
[03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:20.240]  what do you think we're going to break up with leon everybody send us a little bit into jerry
[03:57:20.240 --> 03:57:23.600]  so let's take us it's so important what do you think a meeting with trump him i'm in a press
[03:57:23.600 --> 03:57:30.080]  conference him bringing you there and hillary's never showed no remorse the first time i met
[03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:37.680]  donald trump he hugged me and he said i am so sorry for what happened to you and hillary is
[03:57:37.680 --> 03:57:45.920]  never once showed me any remorse of any kind it's like she laughs she doesn't care well for a fact
[03:57:45.920 --> 03:57:50.240]  trump loves america he's not perfect but he hates seeing us get screwed over that's why there's that's
[03:57:50.240 --> 03:57:54.960]  why the whole corrupt leader against him how obvious is it that the whole bad group we don't
[03:57:54.960 --> 03:58:03.040]  like is against this person i mean it's it's a no-brainer oh i think yeah not not even a comparison
[03:58:03.040 --> 03:58:07.920]  and anything that trump has been accused of saying does not compare to what hillary clinton has chose
[03:58:07.920 --> 03:58:13.200]  to do for 40 years of her career we're gonna come back in 70 seconds i want leon to chime in i saw
[03:58:13.200 --> 03:58:17.760]  leon got some tears in her eyes my sister works here she takes for photos does a great job and
[03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:22.480]  does editing for she's she's because because i mean they admit he pled to this he you know this
[03:58:22.480 --> 03:58:26.640]  went on this this happened she brags and tells people we played the club earlier i don't know
[03:58:26.640 --> 03:58:30.880]  if it came across an am radio but it comes on an fm i mean she just makes fun of how she got him
[03:58:30.880 --> 03:58:34.800]  off and covered up the blood on his underwear when he raped this girl i mean hillary clinton is
[03:58:34.800 --> 03:59:00.720]  a demon excuse me that's what she is you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
