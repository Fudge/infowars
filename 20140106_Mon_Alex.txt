[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:41.760]  on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we're live
[00:41.760 --> 00:50.640]  on this Monday edition already the sixth day of January 2014 you know about a month ago Fox
[00:50.640 --> 00:58.080]  News reported that starting in January and running for about four months waves of radioactive debris
[00:58.080 --> 01:06.000]  only took months for the ocean currents to make it across the Pacific Ocean from Japan to the
[01:06.000 --> 01:12.000]  West Coast of the US and the rest of North America and Northern Mexico and of course all the way
[01:12.000 --> 01:24.240]  up Canada to Alaska the Arctic's been particularly heavy hit but Fox News reported that a large wave
[01:24.240 --> 01:33.720]  of radioactive debris would be hitting in early 2014 and then they asked the ridiculous question
[01:33.720 --> 01:42.360]  is it safe well starting last week one of our reporters Darren McBreen began working on a
[01:42.360 --> 01:49.680]  report with the fact that locals with Geiger counters were showing five to seven to ten
[01:49.680 --> 01:56.600]  times what is the normal level of background radiation with over-the-counter detectors we
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.640]  have purchased several of them they cost about $700 a piece and we're also purchasing right now
[02:01.640 --> 02:06.360]  a professional grade one that cost several thousand but the point is is that the local
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.560]  government went and tested and said indeed it's at least five times normal levels we don't know
[02:11.560 --> 02:20.120]  of that safe well they know full well long term if you live in that area it is not safe and when
[02:20.120 --> 02:27.880]  you watch the YouTube videos of this it starts at about 15 goes up to 150 there on the beach in
[02:27.880 --> 02:34.840]  San Francisco so this is the type of issue I am sending my reporters several reporters camera
[02:34.840 --> 02:40.680]  people to California tomorrow and they will be reporting from California and then they're
[02:40.680 --> 02:45.560]  going to travel to Oregon and then they're going to travel to Washington State in the next week
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.760]  doing the mainstream media and government's job with the Geiger counters and I suggest citizens
[02:52.760 --> 02:56.200]  that live on the West Coast you should go out there with Geiger counters yourself and check
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.800]  your area and then send us reports at show tips and info wars dot com of where you find radiation
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.920]  levels a screenshot of a google map and we will send our reporters there to double verify that
[03:07.720 --> 03:13.240]  but again I want to repeat this to everybody it's here we've been getting hit by radiation
[03:13.240 --> 03:19.160]  for two plus years from Fukushima but this is the big one it's taken two plus years for this
[03:19.160 --> 03:25.480]  debris field from the Fukushima area where the tsunami came in and then the reactors exploded
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.720]  and then a lot of that went out to sea it's taken two plus years for that to get here
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.000]  turns out three months after the disaster the food and drug administration along with the EPA
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.440]  tested yellowfin tuna caught off San Diego and found three to five times the normal
[03:41.560 --> 03:45.320]  what they consider to be safe levels of background radiation in the tuna
[03:46.280 --> 03:50.120]  they decided for a full year not to tell the public
[03:50.120 --> 03:59.880]  so the big issue here is that this is a Chernobyl level event and just like in Japan they're
[03:59.880 --> 04:04.040]  telling everyone that everything's safe now obviously the radiation levels are much lower
[04:04.040 --> 04:10.680]  than they are in and around Fukushima and I would feel comfortable being in and around that
[04:10.680 --> 04:16.280]  radiation area for weeks if not months because I've had physicist nuclear physicist on
[04:16.280 --> 04:24.600]  radiation experts dr. Busby dr. Bob Bowman list goes on and on it's limited exposure short term
[04:24.600 --> 04:30.360]  is not an issue it is the long-term exposure of people that live there on the west coast
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.760]  now something near Fukushima hours is horribly bad for if you're actually over
[04:34.760 --> 04:40.440]  in within a few miles like the schools are in that area the reason I'm not going is I have to go
[04:40.440 --> 04:46.520]  to uncle's funeral Wednesday but I am intending as this develops in the next few weeks to go to the
[04:46.520 --> 04:52.920]  west coast myself you can put that in your bank account and guarantee it I'm going to be going
[04:52.920 --> 04:57.960]  out to California as the radiation wave intensifies this is only the beginning
[04:59.960 --> 05:04.600]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide I'll also enjoying
[05:04.600 --> 05:10.440]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100 organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade
[05:10.440 --> 05:15.000]  my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.520]  grow their unique shade grown arabica beans we have now managed to secure the sought after beans
[05:20.520 --> 05:27.560]  in a highly customized blend discover and try a bag of the patriot blend 100 organic coffee

[05:33.320 --> 05:37.880]  headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally hands down this is my favorite
[05:37.880 --> 05:43.720]  coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers dropped
[05:43.720 --> 05:48.440]  by the site today order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed available

[05:59.560 --> 06:05.400]  com in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the
[06:05.400 --> 06:12.200]  halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in a halogen
[06:12.200 --> 06:18.040]  family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[06:18.040 --> 06:25.000]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.960]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously
[06:31.960 --> 06:38.680]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base
[06:38.680 --> 06:44.120]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family you will find survival shield nascent

[08:31.960 --> 08:39.480]  we have a lot of really important news today including a fast and furious gun running whistle
[08:39.480 --> 08:47.640]  blower joining us from australia then we've got leon macadoo going into downtown austin where there
[08:47.640 --> 08:55.560]  is a hunger strike over removing poisonous hydrofluorosalic acid and calcium fluoride and
[08:55.560 --> 09:01.720]  sodium fluoride from our water supply she's going to pop in with a 10 minute report at the bottom
[09:01.720 --> 09:07.560]  of the third hour we're going to be covering incredibly important economic news military news
[09:07.560 --> 09:20.280]  political news obama care news but as you know we began covering in the last month a fox news
[09:20.280 --> 09:27.560]  report it's also in the tokyo times it's in the japanese newspapers that it took a couple months
[09:27.560 --> 09:36.280]  for the main currents to go across the pacific ocean they flow from japan just like the winds
[09:36.280 --> 09:45.240]  towards north america mexico the united states canada up into alaska and it was reported in local news
[09:45.800 --> 09:49.800]  san francisco chronicle you name it that in the first few months of her fukushima
[09:49.800 --> 09:56.280]  via the air radiation levels in some cases were 10 times normal levels usually three or four times
[09:56.920 --> 10:02.920]  they picked up a whole bunch of different radio active isotopes the fda responded by raising on
[10:02.920 --> 10:08.920]  a limited basis what they said was safe and did not tell people not to drink milk produced in
[10:08.920 --> 10:13.960]  california for a few months because those cows are big bio accumulators just like big fish
[10:13.960 --> 10:19.880]  bio accumulate mercury and uh other toxins and if there's been contamination in the ocean you
[10:19.880 --> 10:23.160]  don't want to eat them for a while same thing with cows you don't want to drink their milk or
[10:23.160 --> 10:29.560]  eat their flesh if they're eating off grass that's had fallout on it and when my wife was
[10:29.560 --> 10:36.120]  um growing up as a daughter of a diplomat in europe when uh chair noble happened for six months
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.280]  they didn't drink the milk they had to ship in powdered milk they didn't eat the vegetables
[10:40.280 --> 10:45.160]  they had to ship it in and that was europe wide eastern europe western europe southern europe
[10:45.160 --> 10:50.760]  she was in italy at that time four chair noble and this is much bigger than chair noble
[10:51.320 --> 10:58.360]  that the un estimates killed a million people since 1986 from thyroid uh cancers and other
[10:58.360 --> 11:05.400]  tumors directly associated with the chair noble disaster in the ukraine now that said here's fox
[11:05.400 --> 11:16.680]  news from november 29th so this is now a month and a half ago is it safe radioactive japanese wave
[11:16.680 --> 11:25.400]  nears the united states in the wake of the deadly tsunami that hit japan in 2011 and severely damaged
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.480]  nuclear reactors japanese officials say the levels of radiation are safe for everyone that's proven
[11:29.480 --> 11:35.400]  to be a fraud outside the reactor area itself but as radioactive water from the plant nears the west
[11:35.400 --> 11:42.920]  coast of north america the water is expected to hit in 2014 can we be sure it's safe i don't know
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.000]  putting a rope around your neck and dropping a chair from under your feet is that safe
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.640]  shooting yourself in the head is that safe we're playing in traffic is that safe i mean this is
[11:53.640 --> 11:59.640]  smoking four packs of cigarettes a day is that safe having unprotected sex with 500 people a year is
[11:59.640 --> 12:09.160]  that safe i don't know is it safe i love how they always just push this now why am i getting into
[12:09.160 --> 12:13.480]  this you have all that debris that's starting to make it over here that took two years to go across
[12:13.480 --> 12:19.240]  it doesn't move as fast as the currents it's been reaching the coastline now in the last few weeks
[12:19.240 --> 12:25.240]  you've got the water that continues in the ongoing meltdowns as they pump seawater into
[12:25.240 --> 12:38.280]  it on the edge of the coast it runs back into the ocean and then it comes right across and
[12:38.280 --> 12:46.440]  circulates around in circles from northern mexico all the way up to alaska now the starfish are dying
[12:46.440 --> 12:50.040]  up and down the coast in mass they've never seen this before they're actually rotting and just
[12:50.040 --> 12:57.320]  desiccating in front of everyone the the the seals are dying the dolphins the whales are dying
[12:57.320 --> 13:03.080]  in record numbers because whales are bioaccumulating they're eating a lot of fish or they're eating a
[13:03.080 --> 13:10.200]  lot of krill a lot of plankton and they are like sponges like filters they're picking it all up and
[13:10.200 --> 13:16.280]  we have all those reports and just like the and i'm getting the big story here in a moment the
[13:16.280 --> 13:21.960]  radiation is 500 times what it should be that's confirmed in california right now in san francisco
[13:22.840 --> 13:28.200]  that's the top story on drudgereport.com on the right hand side we'll put that on screen and
[13:28.200 --> 13:33.640]  click that story and then you notice that uh under it drudge links to the local san francisco
[13:33.640 --> 13:40.520]  newspaper that we're reporting from and they talked to the state and the state's gone out and tested
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.400]  it and found exactly what citizen geiger counters hundreds of these videos have been uploaded the
[13:45.400 --> 13:54.840]  last week as people all over california go out with 500 600 700 geiger counters and they all pick up
[13:54.840 --> 14:04.280]  up the normal background level is 14 on these devices and it's up at 150 you start walking
[14:04.280 --> 14:12.360]  towards the beach in san francisco and it's at 30 it builds up to 40 and then it goes up to 150
[14:12.360 --> 14:22.040]  now again the issue is we saw the deadly dust we saw them lie and say the tower dust and the
[14:22.040 --> 14:30.520]  collapsed towers was safe we saw them come out and say agent orange wasn't bad for people when they
[14:30.520 --> 14:36.360]  knew what it had done in test in and around anniston alabama for the population that lived around
[14:36.360 --> 14:46.920]  the monsanto plant they knew the entire time exactly what this would result in they understood that
[14:46.920 --> 14:57.080]  now it's the same thing on every front just like until 1990 they would not let us troops
[14:57.080 --> 15:04.920]  use depleted uranium in any type of combat or even in any type of drills or or firing range
[15:04.920 --> 15:10.360]  proving ground testing because it ignites going down the barrel whether it's fired out of a vulcan
[15:10.360 --> 15:17.080]  cannon in an a10 warthog or whether it is fired out of a 50 caliber barrett or whether it's fired
[15:17.080 --> 15:30.280]  out of a 308 sniper rifle it ignites going down the barrel and then you breathe a large dose of
[15:30.280 --> 15:38.840]  the radioactive uranium that then at point blank range goes inside your cells and gives you cancer
[15:38.840 --> 15:45.000]  destroys your kidneys destroys your lungs destroys your liver destroys your skin destroys your testicles
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.680]  destroys your ovaries this is what our troops are going through u.s. military last time i checked
[15:50.680 --> 15:59.640]  has five times the birth defects now from the last two gulf wars filugia has 16 times the world average
[15:59.640 --> 16:06.360]  for birth defects where du was used and this goes to show the globalists don't care and they're not
[16:06.360 --> 16:14.680]  going to warn you about what's happening they are not going to tell you about what is unfolding
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.960]  they are not going to tell you what's happening on the west coast back when this happened two and
[16:19.960 --> 16:27.800]  a half years ago back in 2011 just three years ago time flies they picked up with the state
[16:27.800 --> 16:37.560]  testing stuff in vermont and in places on the east coast much higher levels of radiation
[16:39.720 --> 16:45.880]  in the milk in the lettuce in the spinach things that grow on the surface with the fallout
[16:45.880 --> 16:53.160]  so we know this is going on and when you read the article out of the half moon bay review local
[16:53.160 --> 17:01.640]  paper just outside san francisco they name and talk to the state officials who say yes we did find
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.000]  what the other people posting youtube videos of their guard counters found
[17:08.360 --> 17:09.560]  and they go on to say
[17:12.760 --> 17:18.520]  although the radiation level was clearly higher five times then it's typical peterson
[17:18.520 --> 17:23.400]  emphasized that it was still not unsafe for humans a person would need to be exposed to
[17:23.400 --> 17:30.680]  100 micro rms of radiation for 50 000 hours before it surpassed safety guidelines by the
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.400]  occupational safety and health administration he explained well here's the deal they've already
[17:35.400 --> 17:39.480]  raised the radiation level so that's not true you do not want to spend more than a few weeks
[17:39.480 --> 17:44.440]  around this i can tell you right now and if these levels do not subside after a few weeks according to
[17:44.440 --> 17:48.600]  all the nuclear physicists i've talked to i want to get dr busby back on he's a nuclear and chemical
[17:48.600 --> 17:53.560]  physicist as soon as you can guys that's in it we can't get dr bob bowman on former head of star
[17:53.560 --> 18:00.120]  wars he died last year but i want to i want to get some physicists on to break this down
[18:00.120 --> 18:07.960]  so you can hear it from them but it goes on to say that county health officials went out and tested
[18:07.960 --> 18:17.160]  it and did find the same numbers that the youtube video shows so that's confirmed that's confirmed
[18:17.160 --> 18:25.160]  ladies and gentlemen i'm sending my reporters out there but it doesn't matter west coast
[18:25.160 --> 18:33.080]  officials obama don't worry about radiation risk in us cnn says everything is fine just like they
[18:33.080 --> 18:40.120]  said with the dust on 9 11 it turns out the head of the epa was told christina todd wittman
[18:43.560 --> 18:47.400]  they were told that was that of the epa then right checked that for me i'm going from memory
[18:48.440 --> 18:55.720]  just look uh epa told a lie about tower uh air or world trade center collapse air or world trade
[18:55.720 --> 19:01.480]  center dust and will pull up the actual articles from the time the point is is that all of this
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.760]  is happening all of this is going on and we have the two reports and info wars dot com
[19:06.760 --> 19:11.240]  that are taking this local story that the mainstream national media wouldn't cover
[19:11.240 --> 19:16.680]  we've put it out nationwide at prison planet dot com and info wars dot com and our drudge
[19:16.680 --> 19:22.520]  has pushed it out and this will force the media not just here but worldwide to cover it i predict
[19:22.520 --> 19:28.200]  within a week you're going to see reporters out there from dinosaur media crawling the beaches
[19:28.200 --> 19:35.800]  is finding areas with low radiation under under orders and telling you that it's safe yes it was
[19:35.800 --> 19:40.360]  epa had christina todd wittman told reporters at ground zero we've not seen any reason or
[19:40.360 --> 19:47.080]  readings that have indicated a health hazard but cbs news confirms that they lied there's the headline
[19:47.080 --> 19:54.680]  we're told to lie about it and and and they're lying to you right now about the radiation
[19:54.680 --> 20:00.920]  bottom line it's deadly you stay a couple years in this you're going to die cancer young hi folks
[20:00.920 --> 20:05.560]  Alex jones here with some important information i want to tell you about matt redhawk and his
[20:05.560 --> 20:10.760]  team of patriots over at my patriot supply several years ago matt was sitting in his two bedroom
[20:10.760 --> 20:15.160]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlington's willing to sell
[20:15.160 --> 20:21.000]  us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by patriots for patriots was born
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.120]  my patriot supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two
[20:26.120 --> 20:31.480]  distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking american men and women it is rare
[20:31.480 --> 20:37.160]  to find companies who practice what they preach and that's why i stock my pantry with high quality

[24:30.760 --> 24:36.680]  headline info wars.com has Fukushima's radioactive wave already hit California
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.520]  question mark well undoubtedly increased radiation and the fish and other seafood
[24:42.520 --> 24:48.280]  and increased radiation and crops is from fallout and increased radiation hitting the beaches is
[24:48.280 --> 24:57.800]  from Fukushima it's right on time for all of this to arrive but we still put a question mark on it
[24:58.440 --> 25:06.040]  here's another article in info wars.com health officials no concern that's the quote over 500
[25:06.840 --> 25:12.360]  percent increase in radiation levels off california beach by the way folks some of the
[25:12.360 --> 25:25.080]  readings are even higher than 500 times 500 times now again that is still nothing like what you'd
[25:25.080 --> 25:34.120]  have near Fukushima or near Chernobyl but long term exposure from all the physicists that we've
[25:34.120 --> 25:40.760]  talked to all the medical doctors all the scientists all the radiologists this is uber bad for you
[25:40.760 --> 25:47.560]  and we have a lot of affiliates out in california a lot of great people out there when i come out
[25:47.560 --> 25:55.000]  there in a few weeks i mean i guess i'm just going to do it i should probably visit uh michael's
[25:55.000 --> 26:01.080]  whirling and all the great folks out there with two affiliates we have uh in santa cruz to test
[26:01.080 --> 26:06.360]  what's going on out there now these waves can come in and then get diluted and the level can go down
[26:06.360 --> 26:12.600]  but i mean if this continues here's the big crime because so many things are going through my head
[26:12.600 --> 26:17.480]  right now they're not telling the public to take potassium iodine they're not telling them to take
[26:17.480 --> 26:21.240]  thera safe they're not telling them to take survival shield they're not even telling people
[26:21.240 --> 26:26.440]  to go out and get the proper Himalayan and gourmet sea salts not all of them have it that have the
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.840]  naturally occurring iodine because if you don't have that not just in your thyroid but in your
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.160]  glands period you will absorb this stuff like a sponge that's what the thyroid does is it will
[26:37.160 --> 26:45.960]  grab radioactive isotopes the radioactive iodine and it will absorb it along with other toxins
[26:45.960 --> 26:53.560]  like fluoride boring the halogen family into your thyroid why do you think last week the federal
[26:53.560 --> 26:58.840]  government ordered an additional 14 million dosages and when we called them and said as
[26:58.840 --> 27:05.960]  after the american people are for the feds they hung up on us like we should flash back and repost
[27:05.960 --> 27:12.440]  that article and video that Anthony Gucci already did with paul watson last week this makes me so
[27:12.440 --> 27:18.840]  angry that they're not telling people that they need to protect themselves the government
[27:18.840 --> 27:29.240]  is hardening their facilities nationwide hundreds of millions of dollars for two facilities two
[27:29.240 --> 27:34.280]  social security facilities i have more articles here in my stack today the federal reserve is
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.080]  hiring lots of new armed police officers the private federal reserves arming more armed
[27:39.080 --> 27:44.440]  guards record levels i mean government the bankers all of them Goldman Sachs it came out two years
[27:44.440 --> 27:50.200]  ago was hiring armed guards and getting concealed carry permits in new york something you can only
[27:50.200 --> 27:56.200]  get if you're an insider they all get to have guns and they told bloomberg news we have these guns to
[27:56.200 --> 28:01.800]  protect ourselves from the public with what's coming when they take all your pension funds all
[28:01.800 --> 28:07.240]  your bank accounts at least a large piece of it in a bail in and give it to offshore banks what do
[28:07.240 --> 28:14.840]  you think old bozo care is he's not a bozo he's a genius with the globalist so i shouldn't call him
[28:14.840 --> 28:21.960]  old bozo it is a ruled supreme court certified foreign tax to corporations it's been ruled a
[28:21.960 --> 28:27.480]  tax that you pay to offshore banks that own the insurance companies they're already doing it
[28:27.480 --> 28:34.680]  they're already directly taxing you that's the dream of globalism the dream of the sdr's the dream
[28:34.680 --> 28:42.760]  of the hundred trillion a decade at the devos forum search devos wants 100 trillion in new credit
[28:42.760 --> 28:48.040]  every decade and then they list the credit as carbon taxes and bail ins right out of your
[28:48.040 --> 28:54.760]  bank accounts global vat's global toben taxes they are when the casual society goes in folks
[28:54.760 --> 29:05.640]  they are going to hammer us to hell and they're such crazy gangsters bravada hutzpah crazy people
[29:08.040 --> 29:13.560]  that they don't even care of their own kids are breathing radiation i guess they do they're all
[29:13.560 --> 29:20.120]  getting the thorough safe that i wouldn't take long term we sell it we have it an info or store

[29:30.040 --> 29:35.320]  people we sell the nascent iodine we sell the high quality stuff but we've also got the stuff the
[29:35.320 --> 29:41.240]  government's buying and hoarding because we understand it's important i take the iodine my
[29:41.240 --> 29:46.360]  children take the iodine to protect ourselves and for good health but the government won't tell the
[29:46.360 --> 29:52.520]  public to do it while they buy it and gobble it we're on the march the empire's on the run
[29:53.320 --> 29:56.200]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[32:57.960 --> 33:11.880]  info wars shop dot com it's always a tough boat because the average person
[33:11.880 --> 33:16.520]  thinks raising the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt raising the debt ceiling
[33:16.520 --> 33:23.080]  which has done been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt it does not somehow
[33:23.080 --> 33:27.960]  promote profligacy all it does is it says you gotta pay the bills that you've already racked up
[33:27.960 --> 33:39.000]  congress you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:39.000 --> 33:53.960]  so the health department out in san francisco and surrounding areas that have gone out with
[33:53.960 --> 34:00.360]  their own geiger counters their own radiation detectors and they picked up five times the
[34:00.360 --> 34:10.360]  normal level of radiation on a particularly bright day you can maybe get a five ten percent increase
[34:10.360 --> 34:17.080]  in the background radiation and we have all those facts documented in our articles but you don't
[34:17.080 --> 34:23.880]  get a five hundred percent increase and they're saying we don't know if it's bad for you we don't
[34:23.880 --> 34:29.000]  know if it's an issue and then the health department is like you know you don't have to have 50 000
[34:29.000 --> 34:37.560]  hours in this radiation for it to have any problems well the issue is is that if it continues to pile
[34:37.560 --> 34:44.760]  up it continues to come in it won't just go down it will go up it won't stay the same so this is
[34:44.760 --> 34:49.800]  definitely something to watch and it should be the top news story in the united states
[34:51.960 --> 34:57.000]  that the state health department and the local health departments are quoted in here saying
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.560]  yes the radiation is up but we don't know if it's bad for you we don't know where it comes from
[35:03.400 --> 35:08.280]  and then of course we have them saying du isn't bad for you and we have them saying the dust at
[35:08.280 --> 35:12.840]  the world trade center isn't bad for you we have it's back there on McBrain's desk will somebody
[35:12.840 --> 35:18.280]  bring me the retro candy cigarettes uh that say just like daddies that they actually sold in the
[35:18.280 --> 35:22.440]  fifties and sixties you know daddy smoked cigarettes and the doctor on the camel ad
[35:22.440 --> 35:28.120]  and the kent ads would say you know you're having a sore throat got a cough smoke a camel
[35:29.960 --> 35:34.440]  i mean we don't know if cigarettes are bad for you in fact why they had studies saying cigarettes
[35:34.440 --> 35:40.520]  were good for you and the same tobacco labs come out now and say aspartame isn't bad for you
[35:41.560 --> 35:47.880]  they tell you gmo isn't bad for you i mean these people are a pack of liars and then they tell you
[35:47.880 --> 35:55.080]  vitamins though are bad for you vitamins and minerals those are bad aspartame gmo silicone
[35:55.080 --> 36:01.480]  in the mcnuggets melamine uh from china the fda came out a few years ago and said you know
[36:02.040 --> 36:08.840]  it's not bad here it is right here candy cigarettes just like daddy if you're watching us on
[36:09.560 --> 36:16.200]  prisonplanet.tv or infowarsnews.com you can see those or just search candy cigarettes for kids
[36:16.200 --> 36:23.160]  just like dad refreshing orange flavor candy cigarettes
[36:27.240 --> 36:31.800]  and now they put the kids on riddlin and adderall and all the different prozac drugs oh you got
[36:31.800 --> 36:35.480]  in a fistfight when you were 12 with a bully we're gonna put you on drugs we're gonna put you in
[36:35.480 --> 36:39.560]  jail oh you got caught smoking cigarettes in the boys bathroom we're gonna put you on drugs
[36:40.600 --> 36:45.560]  oh you've been late to class we're gonna put you on drugs see it's the same deal praying on our
[36:45.560 --> 36:52.680]  children so i'm the conspiracy theorist cigarettes are bad for your lungs alcohol when it's abused is
[36:52.680 --> 37:02.280]  bad for your liver jumping off cliffs without a parachutes bad for your bones and radiation
[37:02.280 --> 37:06.120]  and all the different isotopes we've got to go back to a couple years ago when fukushima
[37:06.120 --> 37:10.040]  first happened and and and there was that spike at first that went back down thank god because
[37:10.040 --> 37:16.360]  it was in the air where there was some times where it was a hundred times what they called
[37:16.360 --> 37:21.400]  safe levels so they just raised the level there were all different just dozens and dozens of
[37:21.400 --> 37:29.080]  different isotopes that universities berkeley picked them up the universities in southern
[37:29.080 --> 37:33.240]  california picked them up not just northern california not just the bay area i mean we need
[37:33.240 --> 37:39.000]  to go back over all that news i want nothing but radiation coverage on the nightly news tonight i
[37:39.000 --> 37:43.160]  want to go back and show people what happened when fukushima took place three years ago back
[37:43.160 --> 37:49.080]  in 2011 and then i want to walk through all the other cases where they lie to you to illustrate
[37:49.080 --> 37:54.440]  this to people this is a big deal and it shows what they're going to do with the leaking reactors
[37:54.440 --> 38:01.080]  all over the us 91 linking on record look it up 90 plus percent of reactors leaking what are they
[38:01.080 --> 38:07.160]  going to do 20 years ago they started letting troops for 25 years ago use du but in limited
[38:07.160 --> 38:14.920]  capacity wearing breathing apparatus but you'd still get it on your skin and stuff very deadly
[38:14.920 --> 38:20.200]  now it's sit on top the ammo cans that are radiating you use them at regular military
[38:20.200 --> 38:27.560]  shooting ranges uh don't clean anything up all this stuff's fine throw 50 caliber du in you
[38:27.560 --> 38:35.240]  know an ammo can on the back of the navy seal these guys get out without even a bandana over
[38:35.240 --> 38:42.120]  their nose and shoot this stuff on record on television and they say oh the crew chief gave
[38:42.120 --> 38:48.520]  us a radiation detector a radiation badge that you wear around x-rays and stuff doesn't pick up
[38:48.520 --> 38:56.840]  the type of radiation that's in a du shell i've had dr dug rocky the physicist the head of the
[38:56.840 --> 39:03.880]  pentagon du program from 96 on who was part of the teams in 91 cleaning up the highway of death
[39:03.880 --> 39:08.360]  almost his whole team has died he's had more than 40 surgeries last time i checked from du
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.480]  by the way i don't even know if he's well enough we have to he's at the va in virginia last year
[39:13.480 --> 39:19.560]  when we talked to him i know i haven't got word of him passing or anything he's an incredibly tough
[39:19.560 --> 39:27.160]  guy the name rocky certainly sticks with it with the man the name fits the the individual but let's
[39:27.160 --> 39:33.560]  see if dr rocky a vietnam veteran combat veteran you name it just amazing people like that who
[39:33.560 --> 39:38.200]  almost his whole team has died from being around it with the breathing apparatus in the suits
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.600]  from testing and studying du and the pentagon's own reports said we cannot use this it's too deadly
[39:44.600 --> 39:49.880]  and the higher up said we don't care do it just like i had an article yesterday out of the wall
[39:49.880 --> 39:57.240]  street journal where they waived rules on the new fighter jets and drones and missiles to buy the
[39:57.240 --> 40:03.960]  components from china with back doors totally illegal true national security crisis true threat
[40:03.960 --> 40:10.600]  not the fake al-qaeda threat treason our weapons components shouldn't be made overseas we're gonna
[40:10.600 --> 40:17.240]  have a wartime economy guns and butter then we might as well have it here i mean i'm against
[40:17.240 --> 40:21.640]  the military industrial complex economy but let me tell you we're gonna have it it needs to be here
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.520]  if we're gonna have the federal government having control of half the economy you better by law give
[40:26.520 --> 40:30.760]  those contracts to local small businesses of course they violate law and don't they give them to
[40:30.760 --> 40:37.000]  multinationals because the name of the game is consolidate power while you take over and make
[40:37.000 --> 40:46.360]  your political enemies absolutely poor so they can't resist and have a you know what to do what in
[40:47.640 --> 40:52.040]  so this is the bottom line this is how we're being conquered i want to hear from people in
[40:52.040 --> 40:59.240]  northern mexico on the west coast in baha i want to hear from people in california or again
[41:00.600 --> 41:06.840]  washington state utah nevada it's all coming in but if you're on the coast of the west coast
[41:09.480 --> 41:15.480]  what is stopped to you i'm just asking from buying a 500 600 700 dollar radiation detector and going
[41:15.480 --> 41:19.640]  out and testing because they're doing it up and down the coast and they're getting higher levels
[41:19.640 --> 41:28.600]  from the central coast up the bay area up and i'm sending my reporters into san francisco the
[41:28.600 --> 41:34.440]  epicenter of this and up the coast and they're going to take readings every 10 miles all the way
[41:35.720 --> 41:39.640]  this is serious mission they're on they're not going to be stopping and screwing around
[41:39.640 --> 41:45.080]  they're going to be focusing working 15 hours a day to chronicle and mark out on a digital map
[41:45.080 --> 41:50.520]  on a laptop the radiation levels and they're going to be posting that daily at info wars
[41:50.520 --> 41:57.080]  dot com and prison planet dot com adan solazar is going to write the articles and create the map
[41:57.720 --> 42:01.800]  doing what the government and the mainstream media won't do by the way the government knows
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.280]  about the radiation increases they've told the university for three years to shut up that's
[42:06.280 --> 42:11.160]  come out in the news that's why they're buying iodine that's why they're taking it but we're
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.320]  going to do the job of the government and the dinosaur horror media we're going to go from
[42:17.320 --> 42:24.200]  san francisco all the way north up to seattle to the canadian border and we're going to mark
[42:24.760 --> 42:32.120]  that entire coastline up highway one all the way up and they're going to be doing live skype video
[42:32.120 --> 42:39.080]  reports on the radio show from the coast they're going to be filing youtube reports on the ground
[42:39.080 --> 42:45.640]  write to prison planet dot tv and we're going to draw attention to this shows that there can be a
[42:45.640 --> 42:51.080]  national debate about it two days after 9 11 when they came out and said the air was safe to breathe
[42:51.080 --> 42:56.440]  at first sabilias had said don't be there it's deadly asbestos pulverized glass concrete lead
[42:56.440 --> 43:00.680]  mercury arsenic it's deadly don't go unless you have a breathing apparatus then they came out and
[43:00.680 --> 43:07.400]  said oh no it's perfectly safe i said don't give money the red cross united way who on record keep
[43:07.400 --> 43:13.400]  most the money and give it to anti-gun groups on record and open border groups don't give money to
[43:13.400 --> 43:17.320]  who the mainstream media tells you give money it's all criminal operation in my view and the evidence
[43:17.320 --> 43:22.600]  is there red cross got actually caught criminally keeping most the donations from oklahoma city i
[43:22.600 --> 43:29.240]  said give it to local churches here they are enlisted local churches that were taking breathing
[43:29.240 --> 43:36.200]  apparatuses even if it was a paint mask and i actually got criticized at the time people said how
[43:36.200 --> 43:40.760]  dare you say don't give money later it came out it was all a fraud it's always a fraud i told you
[43:40.760 --> 43:44.040]  don't give money to bill clinton's charity half the money goes to pay for his private jets around
[43:44.040 --> 43:48.200]  the world you think you're giving my little black kids you're giving it to the gangster bill clinton
[43:48.200 --> 43:53.640]  the co-ked criminal scumbag rapist you didn't know he's a co-keds scumbag racist they put crack
[43:53.640 --> 43:58.680]  pipes on the christmas tree and pictures of linens stallion and mal these are deranged defilers of
[43:58.680 --> 44:05.800]  everything good they do it because they like it and i told you then the dust is deadly and i've been
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.720]  there with the firefighters and police and met them when they're coughing up blood in the green room
[44:09.720 --> 44:15.080]  who are dead now i know police firefighters and military medics who went in there and they didn't
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.880]  have any gas mask for them they said don't worry about it who worked for days and had nosebleeds
[44:19.880 --> 44:24.760]  and coughed up blood as they literally killed themselves to try to save people and the pig
[44:24.760 --> 44:29.560]  government could have shipped in all the gas masks and apparatus they needed but they didn't want to
[44:29.560 --> 44:34.120]  do that because they wanted to open wall street and open the schools and open the businesses
[44:34.120 --> 44:39.240]  now you've got all these famous people that live down there who are dying of lung cancer
[44:40.200 --> 44:46.440]  and dying of brain tumors huge cancer spikes in and around that area i want to hear from californians
[44:48.120 --> 44:52.760]  i've heard from a minority of californians that go hey man don't try to you know destroy california
[44:52.760 --> 44:59.960]  well you've got major physicists coming out and saying basically calif that that that japan will
[44:59.960 --> 45:06.440]  be unlivable if this thing continues to melt down and the issue is we need to have an international
[45:06.440 --> 45:13.160]  crisis debate about how to really try to fix and mitigate fukushima not have the japanese mafia
[45:13.160 --> 45:19.720]  hire below minimum wage homeless people to remove the rods any mistake will cause a fission
[45:20.280 --> 45:24.440]  maybe low level maybe an atomic explosion according to the physicist they've already
[45:24.440 --> 45:29.080]  got smoke and fire coming out of there now they got the homeless people on suicide missions going
[45:29.080 --> 45:34.440]  in there this is crazy and all you gangsters and governments and all you nihilists you're
[45:34.440 --> 45:39.480]  going to end up destroying our entire civilization with this type of behavior pull up grow up
[45:41.800 --> 45:45.080]  now here is the toll free number i want to hear from west coasters only
[45:45.720 --> 45:50.280]  or folks in japan as well where they covered up how deadly it was and that's now come out three
[45:50.280 --> 46:10.440]  years later 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 john wane shot some westerns in nuclear
[46:10.440 --> 46:16.120]  testing areas out west and he believed that's what gave him that big tumor in his lung and a whole
[46:16.120 --> 46:21.400]  bunch of other people on those crews that shot several films there right after they did nuke test
[46:21.400 --> 46:25.240]  this is the same type of garbage we're talking about here ladies and gentlemen i'm not trying
[46:25.240 --> 46:32.200]  to be an alarmist we told you this was coming it's happening 800 259 92 31 let me go over
[46:32.200 --> 46:40.120]  some of these headlines for you health officials no concern quote over 500 increase 500 increase
[46:40.120 --> 46:47.880]  in radiation levels health officials no concern over 500 increase in radiation levels on california
[46:47.880 --> 46:53.800]  beach prison planet dot com info wars dot com mackayl felon i then wrote an article with
[46:53.800 --> 46:58.040]  watching this morning basically expanding on felon's that's on drudge report dot com on the
[46:58.040 --> 47:05.560]  right hand side has fukushima radioactive wave already hit california i don't know is bill clinton
[47:05.560 --> 47:11.640]  the liar uh is obama carers crew job uh yes it's it's the next wave folks health officials
[47:11.640 --> 47:18.040]  confirmed spike in radiation on san francisco beach but have no answers and again this has been
[47:18.040 --> 47:25.160]  out for a week these increased spikes we were talking about it last week and and my great
[47:25.160 --> 47:28.840]  reporters were debating it back there but nobody came to me and said hey let's do a report on this
[47:28.840 --> 47:32.920]  i saw felon's article this morning at seven a.m wrote one with watch it and said of course we're
[47:32.920 --> 47:40.360]  sending our reporters i mean absolutely that this is a huge huge huge story i'm sending jacari
[47:40.360 --> 47:47.240]  jackson adan salazar and two camera guys out there and adan's going to be writing articles jacari's
[47:47.240 --> 47:56.600]  going to be reporting uh and again they're going to be going up the coastline i'm almost tempted
[47:56.600 --> 48:01.160]  to split them in two groups maybe send another reporter and send one group north and one group
[48:01.160 --> 48:07.160]  south but no i'm gonna go with my original plan i don't think force too many people but
[48:07.960 --> 48:14.360]  we just need to get in there and just hammer the info and actually document all this okay
[48:14.360 --> 48:19.080]  let's go over some background though first researcher links rise in feluja birth defects
[48:19.080 --> 48:25.960]  and concerns the u.s assault defects in newborns 11 times higher than normal now the article i had
[48:25.960 --> 48:31.320]  out of the independent was 16 times higher according to landsit show so that's that's just what du did
[48:32.200 --> 48:38.120]  here's another one west coast officials obama don't worry about radiation risk in us
[48:38.120 --> 48:42.280]  well there you go everything's fine and if you're against the radiation you're racist health officials
[48:42.280 --> 48:50.040]  respond to beach radiation scare half moon bay review let me just read part of this article then
[48:50.040 --> 48:59.160]  we're going to go to break and come back and take your calls at 800-259-9231 800-259-9231
[49:02.280 --> 49:09.800]  it goes on to say here that health officials respond to beach scare an amateur video of a
[49:09.800 --> 49:13.240]  geiger counter showing what appear to be high radiation levels at the coast side beach has
[49:13.240 --> 49:17.240]  drawn the attention of local state and federal public health officials since being posted last
[49:17.240 --> 49:22.120]  week the short video is galvanized public concerns see it's the alternative media doing this that
[49:22.120 --> 49:27.800]  radioactive material could be landing on the local coastline after traveling from japan as the result
[49:27.800 --> 49:32.680]  of 2011 meltdown on the fukushima diacy reactors government officials say they're looking into the
[49:32.680 --> 49:38.520]  video shot december 23rd and performing their own sampling of the beaches but they have found no
[49:38.520 --> 49:43.400]  indication so far that radiation levels were hazardous now listen to this white watch they
[49:43.400 --> 49:48.680]  go on to admit they're up but they say they don't know that's hazardous it's not something that we
[49:48.680 --> 49:54.520]  feel is an immediate public health concern said dean paterson county environmental health director
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.480]  we're not even close to the point of saying that any of this is from fukushima first posted
[49:59.480 --> 50:06.120]  last week the youtube seven minute video shows the meter of the geiger counter as an off camera man
[50:06.120 --> 50:12.440]  measures different spots on the beach south of pillar point harbor the gadgets alarm begins ringing
[50:12.440 --> 50:19.320]  as its radiation ratchets up about 1050 counts per minute or roughly five times the typical
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.400]  amount found the environment counts per minute is a standard way for geiger counters to measure
[50:23.400 --> 50:27.960]  radiation but is not directly equate to the strength of the hazard level to humans yet doesn't tell you
[50:27.960 --> 50:32.280]  the type of radiation the type of isotopes type of hot particles those factors are put on the type
[50:32.280 --> 50:37.640]  of radioactive particles nonetheless the video went viral and then when we come back they go on and
[50:37.640 --> 50:43.640]  admit oh but we the county did test and it is up like he says five times but we don't know if that's
[50:43.640 --> 50:49.480]  dangerous we don't know if that's an issue i mean just playing dumb and of course the mainstream
[50:49.480 --> 50:55.000]  media has no instinct so they couldn't break this because they could care less they've been hired
[50:55.000 --> 51:03.640]  because they don't care about anything being lazy idiots introducing pro one all of your filtration

[55:08.280 --> 55:12.280]  briefly i'm not going to belabor this i told you this before the radioactive wave hit
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.760]  in fact guys we bring me my survival shield i was taking some of it this morning it's out there
[55:16.760 --> 55:22.920]  thank you my my open bottle thanks i take the nation iodine because it's the purest form
[55:23.560 --> 55:28.360]  the proprietary form most nation of the census nation isn't it's if it's black or red on the
[55:28.360 --> 55:33.720]  paper it's not it has to be blue purple ladies and gentlemen and this goes directly into your blood
[55:33.720 --> 55:38.600]  directly into your cells and fills up the thyroids the radioactive isotopes can't get in there and
[55:38.600 --> 55:43.240]  it helps fund the broadcast when you get it it's available at info wars life dot com
[55:43.240 --> 55:51.160]  or call toll free eight eight eight two five three three one three nine we are on the verge of selling
[55:51.160 --> 55:56.920]  out of it but we'll get more in about a week or two but we do still have plenty of the fluoride
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.320]  shield that also has nascent iodine in it but five other ingredients and it's two ounces not one
[56:01.320 --> 56:07.720]  ounce so it is certainly important for the thyroid and across the board to detox the body
[56:07.720 --> 56:13.720]  so survival shield and fluoride shield available at info wars life dot com and again the government
[56:13.720 --> 56:19.160]  will not tell you that during increased radiation levels you need more iodine to protect the thyroid
[56:19.160 --> 56:24.040]  they will not tell you this so consult your physician do your own research and then make a
[56:24.040 --> 56:30.280]  decision you want your thyroid full of radioactive isotopes or good iodine that blocks it it's a very
[56:30.280 --> 56:35.160]  simple question the government's hoarding 14 million dosages of it on top of other tens of
[56:35.160 --> 56:40.600]  millions they bought last week what's going on there i think we can all put two and two together
[56:40.600 --> 56:47.720]  there's a radioactive wave hitting the west coast okay uh we've got wesley paul josh lorraine
[56:47.720 --> 56:53.880]  roy will go to all of you throughout the next 30 minutes then we have a a whistleblower on
[56:53.880 --> 56:59.480]  fast and furious uh joining us a big whistleblower that's been in the news to give us insight and
[56:59.480 --> 57:04.920]  tell them what really happened but first let's go to paul in california then we'll go to wesley
[57:04.920 --> 57:11.320]  josh lorraine and roy paul thanks for calling hey alex yeah paul here from california uh can you
[57:11.320 --> 57:17.240]  hear me okay yes i can sir okay excellent yeah i i live in uh close to the beach like close to
[57:17.240 --> 57:22.920]  redondo beach here in california and um i have to agree with you you know long time listener and
[57:23.480 --> 57:28.040]  you know first time caller uh i think the government sir just totally lying to us about this stuff
[57:28.680 --> 57:34.040]  well what's that reactor by sandiego three years ago that had a big release of radiation and the
[57:34.040 --> 57:38.760]  alarms went off and so they announced work uh they said we're turning the alarms off now
[57:38.760 --> 57:44.200]  so people don't get scared in the future yeah that's out of san clomente that's um excuse my
[57:44.200 --> 57:49.960]  pronunciation here it's uh san onif san uh onifray or something like that yeah that's it that's it
[57:49.960 --> 57:54.760]  yeah i'm trouble browsing and that's it yeah yeah they actually have decommissioned that southern
[57:54.760 --> 57:59.240]  california Edison has actually decommissioned that plant due to all its uh mechanical problems
[57:59.240 --> 58:05.800]  that it's had yeah good good and i don't want to have that thing anywhere near us whatsoever so
[58:05.800 --> 58:11.560]  well what is your take on on the mainstream media in california not covering this oh they're just
[58:11.560 --> 58:15.800]  all bought and paid for by the government it's just propaganda that hey you know everything's
[58:15.800 --> 58:21.080]  okay you know don't worry about it i think it's a flat out lie completely you know uh i work with
[58:21.080 --> 58:26.360]  a lot of top businesses and stuff in the industry and they're like yeah try to stay indoors as much
[58:26.360 --> 58:32.040]  as you can do you know avoid direct exposure to the stuff and you know at first one Fukushima
[58:32.040 --> 58:35.480]  first one up hold on i want to hear more about this stay there back in one minute
[58:35.480 --> 58:38.040]  then we'll go to everybody else stay with us second hour coming up

[58:50.280 --> 58:54.840]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[58:54.840 --> 59:01.400]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world guess what
[59:01.400 --> 59:07.480]  else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal
[59:07.480 --> 59:14.120]  government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on
[59:14.120 --> 59:21.400]  the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas
[59:21.400 --> 59:27.560]  that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:24.360]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:41.240]  we're now into hour number two and if you just joined us the story is the top story on the right
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:47.800]  hand side of drudge report dot com it's a info wars dot com story fukushima radioactive wave has
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:53.160]  already hit california we asked the question has it but no it's hit radiations five times the normal
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:59.640]  level the health department admits but says there's no proof that's bad for you also the fbi says
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:05.080]  their primary mission is national security not law enforcement that is a big deal because they're
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:12.280]  just letting organized crime run wild of course and then following stage terror that their bosses run
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:17.640]  so that's just some of the news health officials say no concern over 500 increase
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.160]  in radiation levels on california beach so that's the news right there on the coldest day in america
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.920]  20 years we have algore stupidest global warming comments we're going to be going over some of that
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:37.800]  today but right now let's go back to the caller who i was just talking to he just dropped i told him
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:42.440]  to hold so that he could talk about the people he was talking to in california oh it doesn't matter
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:47.560]  let's go ahead and talk to josh in california we're talking to folks on the west coast about the
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:54.040]  increase radiation as the uh waves from fukushima finally reached the west coast go ahead sir
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.960]  good morning alex are you doing today i'm doing better than some folks how are you doing out there
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:06.520]  well it's my first day since 26 i caught that that nasty weaponized blue they were sending
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:12.680]  around um i'm about eight to nine miles inland the way the curl flies uh 60 miles north of bohemia
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:19.800]  grove in minnesota county and i've actually went out of my way to speak to um officials around the
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:26.840]  town i live in it's about 30 000 people and uh i've asked them about you know guys that test water
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.440]  and things like that for the county and the city actually and and i just get looks like i'm like
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:39.640]  come out of my mind you know um my girlfriend's ex-husband has a delivery company and every day
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:46.120]  for six years he would go to the coast of fort bragg pick up water samples and bring them to a
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:52.920]  testing uh lab i'm pretty sure right here in the town of ukia and about six months ago they
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.920]  flat out dropped his contract with no reason at all now you're talking about fort bragg uh on
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.040]  uh on the east coast or the or the west coast no on the west coast on the west coast so there's a
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:10.440]  fort bragg there's a fort there's a hold on there's a fort bragg on the west coast yes there is okay
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.080]  and well i'd like to see some documentation of that but i mean here's the deal notice that
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:20.040]  they've already didn't tell the public for a year that tuna was radioactive that that came out a year
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:26.200]  ago uh they didn't tell the public when the milk was radioactive till later and now the the people
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:32.520]  you talk to act like it's weird to want to test for Fukushima because that's the new morals the
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:40.520]  new morals are don't care be an idiot be a be a sucker that's what a real man does and it's
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:45.240]  incredible that it's citizens out there with geiger counters that have forced the health department
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.800]  in san francisco in the county that surrounds san francisco to go test and they admit it is five
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:58.520]  times normal but we don't know if that's from fukushima and we don't know if that's a problem
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:05.000]  and i do see there is a fort bragg uh in northern california up by sinoma county so that's very
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.200]  interesting he said that they would do tests there but they don't know right where they actually
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.760]  stopped the civilian from hauling the water samples to the lab over here in uh inland
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.800]  maybe there was a possibility that something could get out that they don't want oh well there's no
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:27.960]  doubt sir radiation levels have been confirmed by the health department in the county where san
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:33.560]  francisco is that radiation levels are five times i'm not trying to scare people some readings are
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.880]  nine or ten times but i told my reporters you will get some radiation you do not have to go on
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.120]  this mission you can choose to go on it if you wish but it's not a problem for people that are there
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.960]  a few days it's people that are there for weeks months years i mean undoubtedly according to
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.920]  every physicist we've talked to this is going to have a big effect on you but hey we're already

[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:35.880]  well the top story on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com is a doozy very important information it's
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:42.600]  also the top story on the right hand side of dredgerport.com fukushima radioactive wave
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:49.240]  already begins to hit california fox news reported back on november 29th that a radioactive wave
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.080]  from all the seawater they've been pumping over it was nearing the united states and went hit
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.160]  in early january 2014 uh there's no doubt this has happened and california health officials
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.200]  in the state run health department in san francisco for the county say that it is up 500
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:09.080]  percent over normal levels but that they can't say that that's a health concern and they don't
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.280]  know where it's coming from so everything's fine move along go to sleep what needs to be tested
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:21.240]  is the fish and obviously we're going to send our reporters when they get out there with geiger
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:28.120]  counters into the fish markets the open air asian fish markets into the grocery stores you name it
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:33.320]  with the geiger counters by the way don't think the dinosaur media hasn't gone and pitched this
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:39.560]  to their bosses and they're like no in fact will you guys print me the article i think it was nbc news
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:46.760]  los angeles but it doesn't matter from about a year ago that three months after fukushima the tuna
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.880]  had a radioactive isotub sent it it was like three to five times depending on the fish
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:57.400]  and that they decided to not tell the public the food and drug administration and the epa
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:04.680]  in conjunction tested the fish and didn't tell you till a year later just like the dust on 9 11
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:10.040]  just like the du the troops are using so i'm going to send my crew out to the fish places
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.880]  here in austin that stuff's coming from there as well i mean where is the real media in this
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.800]  country it takes citizens going out in the last three years it'll be three years in march since
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:28.040]  fukushima and they found a doubling a tripling early on in the seawater now more waves of it
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.640]  have come and it's five times six times seven times eight times nine times ten times we're
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:38.760]  going with the lowest reading there's a whole bunch of youtube videos that citizens are shooting
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.880]  up and down the california coast and it's in other states too they're just not doing it there
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.440]  there's more folks in california per capita some more put up youtube videos that's another
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:53.080]  issue we should search for uh oregon and uh washington state videos that have been put up in
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:11:03.880]  the last week and the health department went out there tested it and confirmed that indeed it was
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:12.280]  higher levels health officials responded to the beach radiation scare in the following days the
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.880]  other amateurs with geiger counters began posting similar videos online the videos follow
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.160]  other alarming news last month that starfish were mysteriously disintegrating along the west coast
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:29.000]  a trend that has not been linked yet to any cause past computer simulations that indicated the radio
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.040]  active cesium 137 from the fukushima reactors could begin appearing on the west coast shores by
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:39.960]  early 2014 those findings published in august by the institute for cross disciplinary physics
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.280]  and the complex systems in spain also noted that any radioactive material that crossed the pacific
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:53.320]  would likely be diluted and fall below international safety levels so they're trying to calm people
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:57.160]  down here county health officials first learned the radiation levels last week and they sent out
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:03.640]  their own inspector on december 28 to pacifica with a geiger counter using a different unit the
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:10.280]  county inspector measured the beach to have a radiation level of about 100 micro rems per hour
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:16.760]  or five times the normal amount exactly what the citizen active is found with their geiger counter
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.000]  exactly we're going to send our reporters to that exact area and go up down the beach
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.000]  we're going to send them to pacifica we're going to send them to the other areas listed here
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:41.320]  re m stands for rotogen equivalent man a measurement of the dose and statistical biological effects
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:46.920]  presented by radiation although the radiation levels are higher than typical pierce and emphasize
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:53.640]  that it was still not unsafe for humans a person would need to be exposed to 100 micro rems of
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:00.200]  radiation for 50 000 hours before it surpassed safety guidelines by the occupational safety
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.120]  and health administration explain here's the problem ladies and gentlemen we're going back to your
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:12.840]  calls you get that background radiation because there'll be a hot particle down in the sand a
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:22.600]  foot under the sand or a hot particle on a log of beachwood or on a shell and then you're picking
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.960]  it up 10 feet away it's making the ambient level go up that's why you can move the geiger counter
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:35.080]  around on these videos and it'll be 50 and then it'll spike up to 100 or 150 depending on when
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.880]  you wave it because there's hot particles all over the place i will tell you this i would not swim
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:46.040]  in the west coast water right now i would surely uh i mean where's the cities where's the counties
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.800]  they should have radiation levels posted daily off readings i mean they tell you if jellyfish
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:57.720]  numbers are high they tell you if the riptide's high but they don't want you to know about the
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.360]  radiation quite frankly we've already had the stuff from the air come over and hit us years ago
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.040]  and they didn't tell us not to drink milk or not eat vegetables that grew on the surface of the
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:12.840]  ground like spinach for a few months they didn't care about us they just said go ahead and eat it
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:20.120]  now this is waterborne and it's going to get picked up by wildlife and spread everywhere
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:27.000]  but it will get diluted even more but the main issue is being in that water and eating the fish
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.560]  that come out of that water and no one is warning anybody
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:38.520]  and it's the attitude of out of sight out of mind
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:45.080]  Peterson the head of the health department admitted he was befuddled as to why radiation
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:50.520]  levels were higher than normal but he was skeptical that Fukushima meltdown could be the cause
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:55.240]  oh yeah that's not what it is even though the computer models all show it should be happening
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.920]  right now he noted that many innocuous items could spike the radiation levels in the area including
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:09.640]  red painted disposable eating utensils what total whitewash folks out of one local paper
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:15.400]  what would you do without citizens out there with geiger counters and citizen media online
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.160]  then picked up here's the food chain picked up by citizens on the ground picked up by info wars.com
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:26.920]  and prisonplanet.com then carried by the drudge report to the next level they will now have to
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:36.680]  address this and you will now see them abc nbc cbs fox whitewashing everything on the west coast
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:44.200]  telling you everything's fine and you know i'm not saying this is a super big crisis i think it is
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.760]  but i mean obviously it may dissipate i hope it does it probably just going to keep building
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:54.280]  up as the meltdown continues but for them to just cover it up and for this to not be a news issue
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:59.400]  you know it's serious and well their history of lying to everybody about everything you can imagine
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:06.600]  this is a very serious situation 800-25-99-231 i'm going to go to roi then i'm going to go
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:13.320]  to wesley and paul and billy and lorraine and everybody so have your point we're going to move

[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:27.080]  i want to hear from people let's talk to roi in origan thanks for calling hey alex yeah i was
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:33.480]  at work one day and doing a safety observation on somebody and all of a sudden i get this hot
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.240]  metallic taste in my mouth it felt like the back of my head was going to blow off
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:44.680]  and it was like what was that and i had a form and stand the next to me and i told him i said hey
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.800]  i think something just happened i don't know what it was but then after starting to understand what
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.440]  this whole thing is with the heart hot particles i'm pretty sure that's what i sucked in because
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:59.240]  the very next day it was like my whole immune system had shut down and i came down with this
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:06.280]  horrible cold and just felt like garbage well that's it radiation sickness can make you have
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.720]  impaired immune system or a normal bacteria or virus can kill you and a lot of experts think
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.920]  that's why the the flu and bugs are so bad this season is because all of america has been basting
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:23.080]  for almost three years and radiation i can imagine yeah i'm uh i get most of my information
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:31.800]  from arnie genderson and then uh red check on uh on facebook uh christina consolo we need to get
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:35.480]  them on i've heard of their work that they're getting geiger counter numbers from all over the

[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.760]  think it's weird that he's worried about it too i mean what is wrong with these people well it's
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.280]  like they're all in a dream world they don't really care what's going on around them until
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:29.160]  they start getting sick and then they'll start you know waking up but by then it's going to be too
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:34.840]  late well now they've got obama care that costs three times more isn't that a good deal no good

[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:16.120]  enough to affect the world far greater than thought say scientists that's in the london
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:22.440]  independent we're going to be breaking that down as well meanwhile though obama came out
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:32.040]  back uh in september and said that uh we were going to have record hot temperatures uh this
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:38.280]  this winter but of course none of that none of that even matters don't let don't let facts
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.960]  get in the way in fact here's the article i was looking for it from cns news executive order
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.640]  excessively at temperatures already harming public health uh back in november it wasn't september
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:57.800]  two months before today's assault by record low temperatures he signed executive order uh to harass
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:04.040]  businesses more and do a bunch of other garbage and shut down power plants uh because of the global
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.920]  global global warming of course china is only opening new pants plants not shutting them down
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.880]  that's all part of the plan shut down america wesley in tennessee he's he's not calling from the west
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  coast but says he has friends in japan wants to talk about the radiation in fukushima go ahead
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.200]  yeah i'm actually a japanese language major and history major at mithus university and i have the
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:31.080]  number of foreign exchange student brands i hang out with mostly japanese people just because i guess
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:38.360]  i can't stand the mentality of most americans nowadays but um yeah they all say that i have
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.080]  there's at least three of them here that are from fukushima prefecture and one from sendai which is
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:49.800]  about 50 miles north and they say the babies being born there are it so many birth defects all the
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:55.240]  kids are low energy they have the fatigue they you know they they don't have any desire to do
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:01.640]  anything they just feel like zombies and i have another friend here that that lives in mishima
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.320]  she's japanese and her uncle and i can vouch for this you know it's i can't prove it over the phone
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:12.840]  but her uncle is in the yakuza and he says everything the big government is point he's
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.720]  pretty high level too but he's saying everything that the government over there has put it out
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:23.480]  is complete bs and they're trying to shut up the media over there oh yeah they tell schools to stay
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:30.200]  open of just five miles away but it's on record they're having birth defects and kids dropping dead
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.000]  and most of the people that were part of the first mission died i mean it's on record it's come out
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:41.400]  they're lying but notice they lied up front so that becomes the official story how does this
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:45.160]  tie into california what do you think about the increased radiation levels there and the very
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:51.080]  same whitewash happening well it's clear if you look at the prevailing winds around the world it
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.480]  flows from japan to the united states that's just basic common knowledge and so do the so
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:01.320]  the currents but see being informed is a conspiracy theory go ahead oh of course and that's what's
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.560]  happening in japan as well i mean ever since world war two i guess their government has been
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:10.280]  completely controlled by the same global globalist and but i think the japanese media are trying
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:15.400]  harder at least in our media to try and cover this stuff but they're there you see you've
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.560]  covered this yourself they're trying to shut their media up with that's right they signed an
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:24.600]  executive order three weeks ago to shut them up about all this japan is basically going into a
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:31.160]  dictatorship yeah and all the all my friends here they're they're saying the overall consensus of
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.560]  the japanese people they don't trust their government i mean it is i think it's a worldwide
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.960]  phenomenon it sounds like they're extremists are they racist i mean if you don't love government
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.400]  and love everything they do you're racist msnbc said so oh yeah i think they're completely
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.560]  extremist i mean they're there i mean did you see that teapot that looked nothing like hitler that was
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.520]  banned i mean if i see a cloud that looks like hitler oh you know we need a bomb to go off in
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:00.200]  the cloud to knock away the hitler mustache because it's racist hey hey they're even upset about you
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:04.200]  know the government what the government re-arming and you know this dispute with china so i get
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:09.240]  their racist against chinese too you know well i mean look you got to worship government and do
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:14.680]  what they say and and and you heard the callers from california and oregon if you care about the
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:21.240]  increased radiation you're an extremist and weird it's weird to care about massive radiation pounding
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:28.680]  you for almost three years uh i mean it's weird uh and so i you know i'm not scared of the radiation
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:35.080]  i'm scared of al-qaeda that our government publicly runs and i want to give all my rights up so they'll
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:39.800]  keep me safe how's that sound that sounds great you know might as well we've been doing it all

[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:31.320]  transmission you are the resistance we start the next hour i will go back to callers on the west
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:36.600]  coast about their concerns about increased radiation levels five to ten times normal
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:42.280]  background radiation confirmed by the county health department environmental researchers
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:48.600]  after citizen journalist a week and a half ago went out with geiger counters scores of them
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:54.600]  showing between five and ten times radiation increases on average it's about five times
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:02.040]  i i told you this three years ago or almost three years ago when fukushima happened but i've talked
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:07.560]  about all the radiological events in the in the northern hemisphere all the leaking reactors the
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:13.480]  du all of it the northern hemisphere has more than double the radiation of the southern hemisphere
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:19.960]  now and our cancer rates are massively higher than people in the southern hemisphere let's look at
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:26.600]  those numbers and now with fukushima conservatively according to physicists we've had on ten times
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:34.920]  bigger than chernoble in 1986 you are insane if you don't take a regular thyroid supplement in my
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:40.520]  view consult your physician but even gourmet salt if you check the brand that has the natural iodine
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:46.920]  not the chemical iodine will protect you so it can be done pretty inexpensively but when you've
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.800]  got radiation you need higher levels of it according to the medical information i've read but check
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:57.240]  it for yourself we sell what the government just bought 14 million dosages of last week
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:01.240]  and we said it was because of the wave hitting the west coast and now that's
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:07.880]  breaking and confirmed we have this in stock thyro safe but this is what you take when the
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:15.720]  major fallouts happening what you take regularly to fill up your thyroid with good iodine and what
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:23.160]  i take is the proprietary nation iodine from info wars life dot com known as survival shield
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:26.520]  and i came across this six months ago in my quest to find the best iodine
[01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:31.400]  that my children could take that wouldn't upset their stomach and that they would take
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:37.400]  and because this is real pure iodine not oxidized iodine mixed in with other stuff
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:41.560]  i'm not knocking it it's better than nothing especially on your skin you know anything's
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.720]  better than nothing well you've heard the rave reviews it's an amazing things for my clarity
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:51.640]  body my organs everything and for the folks that have taken an info wars life dot com
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:58.200]  or call toll three eight eight eight two five three three one three nine and we will sell
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:03.800]  out of it today if not by tomorrow but then you can pre-order and it should more should be here
[01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:09.160]  in a week but i want to say two weeks because all the storms and the rest of it but the point
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:16.600]  is it's made right here in america the glycerin is non-gmo kosher certified from germany only
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:23.160]  place you can get corn to make glycerin that isn't gmo one of the only places and the point is is
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.360]  that we also have fluoride shield that's two ounces not just one ounce of this of the survival
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:33.480]  shield the fluoride shield has the iodine in it as well but five other ingredients known to disc
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:39.080]  to detoxify and protect the glands and more develop a doctor group and others and to the
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:43.880]  gutiarty was involved as well the shellocene and four other compounds and then the iodine that's
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:50.360]  six compounds fluoride shield that i'm also taking it can be taken with the uh survival
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:56.600]  shield nascent iodine so toll three number eight eight eight two five three three one three nine
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:04.680]  or you can simply go to info wars life dot com but we should have produced and ordered more i just
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.560]  keep getting caught off guard by these Fukushima developments and they've got homeless people
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.720]  removing the rods if those rods end up touching it could cause well will cause an explosion the
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:20.840]  only question is how big of a fire or explosion will it cause and it just goes from bad to worse
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:26.520]  because the elite don't care anymore this happens throughout history they're just insane with gmo
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.920]  genetic engineering overfishing all of it they just are crazy and then meanwhile just want to
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:39.400]  tax us for carbon taxes so again info wars life dot com now is the time to get prepared ladies and
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:48.280]  gentlemen on so many fronts let me hit some of the other headlines and then we will go to our
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:55.240]  whistleblower guest that is joining us the federal reserve is hiring lots of new armed police
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:59.720]  officers it's of course private the social security administration is spending tens of millions per
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:06.200]  facility to literally harden them and create swat team like divisions also have articles here in
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:13.000]  austin i told you yesterday about armored swat vehicles being used for the first time code visits
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  in california they swat teamed a guy who dared build a basement a fallout basement and his neighbors
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:26.520]  called the police on him so they swat teamed him and took his guns he's now suing you don't even
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:31.320]  get a knock at the door you're just a regular nice person done nothing wrong the fact that you
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.600]  want to get prepared the fact that you want to build a basement for tornadoes that's criminal
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.840]  no judge no jury no charges you just have your guns taken this is the insane government
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:48.680]  and you heard the callers earlier in california who are concerned about radiation that the government
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.400]  admits is five times regular their neighbors and friends just laugh at them and go you're insane
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.440]  who cares all radiation i dance in it open borders we dance in it
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.360]  fbi's primary mission is now national security not law enforcement and then there's this article
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:13.160]  right here jp morgan chased to pay two billion to avoid bernard made-off investigation reports
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.320]  so they've stolen trillions now they pay a small tip to the criminal government jp morgan uh and
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:26.040]  go to pay another fine and again the fbi has cut its white collar fraud groups down to nothing
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.440]  down to nothing it's a total criminal takeover now all they fight is terrorism meanwhile the
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.960]  globalists run most the terrorists while on vacation obama shames gop for going home for the
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:44.200]  holidays for even three days you cannot make this up he took what a 13 14 day vacation
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:53.400]  and 160 rounds of golf michelle is still there millions a day i mean it just doesn't matter
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.080]  it's so insane an excellent article by washington's blog up on info wars dot com the biggest terrorism
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:04.840]  scaremongers are themselves the ones promoting terrorism i love washington's blog because i
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.320]  talked about this yesterday and then he wrote an article about it i want to get washington's
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.040]  blog on sometimes just know him to bloom is washington's blog because i can tell a lot of times i cover
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:18.280]  something and point something out and he writes about it which i love i pointed out peter king
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.840]  and john mccain are all funding al-qaeda meeting with al-qaeda and he says you've got a spy on
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:30.360]  congress in case they're with al-qaeda and it's the guy with al-qaeda i mean that is certainly rich
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:39.560]  isn't it i've got some other important news to get the uh race baiting uh going even better uh in
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:46.200]  this country i'm going to cover this after calls in the middle of the next hour judge allows access
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:51.400]  to emails about arizona's immigration law all you got to have is an id to vote the illegals
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:55.160]  are voting everywhere the country's collapsing the third world's collapsing we're going bankrupt
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:00.200]  the illegals are being brought into vote to take our guns and then meanwhile they're going to
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:08.280]  take hundreds of thousands of emails in the year-long debate on sp 1070 or 1070 and of course they're
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:14.280]  going to have racist sending in emails they're going to have fake sending in false flags to then
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:20.840]  claim that if anyone sent emails against mexicans then the law is racist that's what it actually says
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.240]  opponents of sp 1070 consider the country's toughest state law against illegal immigrants
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.360]  may examine correspondence to see whether it contains racial overtones the ruling says to see
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:35.480]  if there were any emails sent that were racist i mean this is total race war garbage by the way
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:40.680]  i got good news for the patriots and baddest for the globalist my biggest fans on the streets of
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.920]  austin are hispanic americans who love their kids and love liberty and want to own guns and have
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:52.360]  private property it's not working the the hispanics that have been here and are americans know what's
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.280]  going on you got a language barrier to the other ones but i think this is going to backfire on them
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:01.880]  folks mexicans in mexico want to own guns and are forming illegal militias to protect themselves
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.520]  this is not going to work we've got to reach out to these folks so we've got that but just talk
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:13.000]  about incredible race baiting you can go with keyword data search through any emails you want
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:18.040]  of an entire state database and find anything you want schizophrenics thinking they've got chips in
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:25.080]  their brains crazy people i'll guarantee you this there's going to be tons of racist hispanics
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:29.480]  saying you you racist whites go back to europe you're scum i mean just because that's going on
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:35.000]  does that mean this is crazy folks no country is as wide open as we are to immigration and then
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.800]  you put people on welfare we're going bankrupt all right for the balance of the hour and a little
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:48.920]  bit of the next we're joined by our guest this is a big deal this is a major whistleblower
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:54.680]  from fast and furious and what they've done is tried to scapegoat the gun shops and gun dealers
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:43:01.880]  who expose fast and furious selica steel a former dea top agent former army veteran in vietnam
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:07.480]  highly decorated honorably discharged longtime guest on this show exposed that our government was

[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:31.560]  to destabilize mexico then when it started coming out they burned a few gun shops
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:34.920]  that they'd ordered to also be part of it in quote investigations
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.880]  that were really meant to then also blame the second amendment and that's come out in memos
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:46.920]  via cbs news so this was a false flag staged event that blew up in their criminal faces now let's go
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:53.160]  to our guest ian garland uh fast and furious justice now tell folks in a nutshell then we'll
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:58.680]  get into more details about what happened to you your story and where you are right now sir thank
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:03.720]  you for coming on thank you alex i moved from california about five six years ago to chaparral
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:09.560]  near mexico met my wife got married on the fourth of july out of all dates because that's special
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:15.240]  to us to open a little gun shop i had one in el paso one in uh chaparral there i'd go back
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:21.960]  aboard and uh after a amount of time i had the people come from columbus uh they drove a police
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:26.840]  car they were in uniform they were who they said they were it was the mayor the police chief the
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:33.080]  trustee police officer from columbus new mexico and this case came out later yes oh absolutely yes
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.360]  and they wanted to buy some guns i'm like yeah you know the procedure i have to call in the
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.880]  background check and get a pass by the fbi and they said they were fine with that so a month later
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:45.720]  they came back and they wanted to buy ten more and i said what do you want to buy ten for well we
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:50.200]  want to give some to our families and uh friends you know for protection for the board um on the
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:55.480]  border right there and sometimes we go to gun shows buy sell trade collect and i'd already
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:46:00.360]  not only check with the atf i had complained to the atf about private sales with three to
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.320]  four hundred guns on their tables with no paperwork no background check required and the atf tells me
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:10.040]  that's legal so my customers want to do that also so i'm like yeah what they were doing was selectively
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:16.040]  enforcing with groups they controlled in austin if you sell your granddaddy's shotgun the atf's
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:20.520]  going to beat your head in in the in the in the parking lot and take you to jail for stuff totally
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:24.840]  legal but if you're one of their tables that they're running and making money off of you can do
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:31.480]  whatever you want absolutely and when i sell more than one handgun you have to lodge a multiple
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.000]  purchase form one to the atf and one to the local sheriff which was otaro county sheriff here in
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:44.120]  new mexico and i did that for 18 months i sold to these people off and on and finally the atf
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:49.240]  they'll follow me i was chased them down the road i end up doing an undercover sting because one guy
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:53.800]  tried to bribe me not this group from columbus but another person tried to bribe me and he wouldn't
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:58.520]  leave me alone and i said hey you guys need to help me with this guy and they said will you help us
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:04.200]  basically get him so i'll after much apprehension i did the undercover sting you know i was scared
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:09.240]  of reprisals from my wife my family everything but i did my part and then they come and ask me
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.720]  about these guys from columbus are you worried about they buy 20 guns one month 20 the next i
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:18.760]  like no they want to go to gun shows they buy sell collect trade i mean they do the background check
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:24.760]  they drive a police car to my business they can do the form i mean why would i be worried especially
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:30.520]  here this is the other point i want to make why i wasn't worried this was almost 18 months alex
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:36.120]  with no trace information but if guns are turned up the procedure is they're supposed to be traced
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.600]  back to me through the atf and i say yeah i sold it to john smith et cetera blah blah blah
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:45.800]  and not sure the truth is because i've read your case for tell folks the atf knew the whole thing
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:50.840]  once you exposed it they had to cover their butts by acting like they were investigating
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:55.240]  yes absolutely and it was proven in the congressional report which i had a copy of
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:59.240]  that they had to trace information and they stood on it so their little operation could continue
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.520]  and that was proven and then of course we all know what happened it didn't matter
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.240]  that thousands of mexican citizens were dying but when one border patrol agent was killed god
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:15.640]  rest your soul we know what happened absolutely there's now been a death tell folks about that
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.720]  the brian terry absolutely and and now it's come out in mainstream news
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:28.280]  arizona central that the fbi was key in the slaying and the cover-up oh absolutely and then
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.400]  come to find out i did research after the last 18 months they knew about these this court documents
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.160]  they knew about these people in columbus before i even moved to chaparral back in 2007 and these
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:45.240]  people the uh government officials that bought for me for 18 months had direct ties with jamie
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:52.840]  aviya he's that's jamie aviya who the atf led by that rifle who killed brian terry and this
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:57.400]  is all come out in the arizona republic it's come out in the la times but still no one's
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:02.040]  gotten in trouble so people say if something like this happened we'd know about it people would
[01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:07.400]  blow the whistle well you have blown the whistle and to try to discredit you up front because
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:12.840]  you were the original whistleblower they ended up trumpeting stuff up on you and throwing you in
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:18.200]  jail and i would say sir your life's in danger now oh absolutely and it got me in el paso here
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:24.280]  i'm 300 miles from my family i mean i have no car no money and the thing was i won my case on
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:30.280]  friday the 13th last month in december and they put me out on the street for five days home was
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:36.600]  i had no money no id no phone no clothes no car i mean can you believe that the first thing i did
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.800]  was went finally went to a library got in touch with my wife um she helped me i got this little
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:46.760]  cell phone i mean oh my god i couldn't believe i was homeless for five days i mean that's probably
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.880]  about the worst experience of my wife in all this well i can tell you if you're a small gun shop with
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:57.720]  a john wane uh photo hanging in it and you don't got an eye they're going to take you to jail but
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:02.360]  if you work for the criminal government and are actually a drug dealer i mean that's all the atf
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:08.280]  and fb ir at that level they are the drug dealers they are the gun runners and it comes out over and
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:13.640]  over again they've always been that they are law enforcement so they can carry out the criminal
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:19.000]  operations folks i mean it doesn't make sense why would i do the paperwork and all the background
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.080]  checks and the multiple reporting forms and making the paper child back to myself well yeah you're
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:28.920]  the guy that for those that don't know that blew the whistle that made them investigate that ended
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:34.440]  up bringing down these police chiefs and mayors into mexico that were involved in this so the atf
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:39.160]  to cover their butt because they were involved in it put you in jail absolutely the bottom line is
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.680]  how do you explain that i was selling for 18 months to people they knew for years was smuggling how bad
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.800]  do i make them look alex how bad you make them look bad and as you said you're down on you've
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:55.080]  now explain your case more when we come back and where you think fast and furious is going and
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:51:02.600]  how big you really think it is major whistleblower joins us right now the facts are in the studies

[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:47.240]  for his evil crime of selling guns to police with background checks on record his crime was
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:51.400]  exposing it so they had to bust one of their little atf operations that's all come out
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:59.000]  his crime is blowing the whistle and he was telling us off air that his probation officer
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.280]  and tell us what you've been convicted of now but then the other case you just won that you're
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:09.800]  not supposed to talk to the media i mean i guess they were supposed to put you in jail to silence
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.920]  you tell us tell us what they're telling you that's what they did i expect kept me in solitary
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:22.200]  confinement for 473 days cbs news flew out to interview me it was all authorized and at the
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:27.800]  last moment they canned it i mean i was freezing in that cell i lost 72 pounds i was sitting in
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:34.360]  raw sewage cleaning it up with my hands day after day not once not twice but multiple times oh you
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:39.080]  just can't believe what they did to me and they denied my first amendment right and early last
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:44.520]  week the media tried to interview me again and they denied me i just can't believe it um they got
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.720]  the lawyers involved they'll pass our times here did a big story on me yesterday and they'll go after
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:54.040]  them i mean this is just unbelievable and i guess that all came about because now the mexican
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:58.840]  consult general wants to speak to me tomorrow they actually denied that but suddenly uh after the
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.200]  lawyers got involved they had to change a hot because that was my first amendment right and i'm
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.720]  an american citizen i'm damn proud of it absolutely we're proud to have you as a citizen uh and i
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.120]  followed the case of everything you're the guy that blew the whistle so they put you in jail
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:19.240]  to to to covered it up and then for 400 days had you in solitary confinement that's what they did
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:23.080]  to me a few times i've been in jail they always have a special cell they put people in that they
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:29.240]  don't like yeah with crap all over the walls and then laugh at you imagine wanting to abuse people
[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.960]  like that that's just amazing my god i had permanent physical injuries right now i mean the
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.440]  one i was subjected to was unbelievable i mean everyone said they're trying to break you but
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:43.320]  i will not give up alec i won i beat them they lied on what they said that's how i was able
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.880]  to get out early and now i'm trying to overturn this and get a big investigation i mean this
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:52.280]  just needs to be investigated totally even these people the government officials from
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:56.760]  columbus i ran into them by accident and they were kind of worried you know they're like well
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:01.160]  we're sorry man i'm like look guys by the way you know what one of the top law said is guys
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:07.720]  who was in federal court a year ago said he said they were shipping drugs and guns back and forth
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:13.880]  for the cia and fbi absolutely go into everything these people and the fbi came into the federal
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:20.200]  court and said that's true national security and shut down him being able to use that that he openly
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:25.400]  worked for them go ahead that's unbelievable and these people you know the mayor the police chief
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:30.840]  they all said to my face hey ian we're sorry you're here man we all told him you had nothing to do
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.960]  with us yeah we had to use your guns door to buy from as well as many others so they have known
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:40.280]  from the start alex and the phone calls there's nothing on the phone call that i wasn't involved
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:46.520]  it was mere um how do you say it buy a stellar relationship that is it so they still did this
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.320]  to me basically because i make them look bad 18 months telling the people they knew for years
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:57.320]  to promote their little operation sure and this is to protect obama past the election absolutely
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:03.160]  i mean this is one of the things this is hilarious i came back from mexico they stripped my car
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.320]  tell me i can go on my way a week later i get arrested and they asked me about this magazine

[02:00:52.440 --> 02:01:01.160]  but finishing up with with our guest here today he is a major major whistleblower who's
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:08.600]  all over the news ian garland uh has somebody who did nothing who they set up because he wouldn't
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:13.160]  basically play along with a fast and furious program the atf was acting like they didn't
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:19.320]  know about what are the other points mr garland you'd like to make for people on record and uh i
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.800]  know you're pushing for open investigations of fast and furious but we we know what they did
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.200]  we know the white house ran it go ahead there's something that just doesn't make sense you know
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:33.000]  i mean the police chief and the mayor i mean how did they not know the guns wouldn't be traced
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:38.760]  that's what i can't work out i mean maybe any you know layman's person or maybe someone else might
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.600]  know but you're talking about police officers or police chief and i told them i said at least
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:47.720]  turn up in crimes that will be traced and you'll be in trouble and they're like oh no no no problem
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:51.800]  there for us we'll do the background check i'm like that's what i can't work out that's one thing i
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:57.640]  haven't been able to work out from now well we know what we know what was going on with this case
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:04.440]  to many others they were pressuring gun dealers you name it as as fences or as rat holes they would get
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:10.280]  other people to do it the atf would turn a blind eye to get the guns down there and that's the only
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:15.080]  reason they came in and busted them was because you were exposing it absolutely there was one
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:20.920]  gun dealer else we were doing transfers and we decided not to sell to one person and the atf
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:26.360]  came in and asked about the guy and my i was right there and we asked is there a problem no should we
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:30.600]  not sell anymore to this person oh no he's not prohibited telling him what he wants and they
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:35.080]  knew he was smuggling too i mean god i mean i just couldn't believe this when i read all
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:40.120]  all of this they let thousands of guns go three something like three thousand document firearms
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:44.840]  go and that's not counting the so-called private sales by the so-called private collectors which
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:51.000]  was legal i mean you talk about tens of thousands of guns did they get upset when uh you got out
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:58.600]  of jail early and began to win your case oh yeah they're pissed they really are sorry about that but
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:04.600]  they are pissed i mean they they don't want me to talk alex i mean i've lost my house i don't even
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:10.280]  have a car yeah my wife's 300 miles away you know having a hard time with things like family and
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:15.160]  kids are down there the roll split up i mean i don't have two pennies to rub together remember
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:19.400]  this just you know hate to beg or any telling my hard luck story but this is what they did to me
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:26.200]  all my animals are dead my beautiful 12 and 13 year old cat are dead i mean i hope i'd enjoy all
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:31.080]  my animals my ducks my turkeys that were my pets we have lost everything a beautiful house and
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:36.200]  shep around that was going to be our retirement gone well let's talk about this it's terrible
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:40.600]  how they burned you for being a good guy uh tell us about the supreme court ruling on your case though
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:45.800]  that's big yes i was doing some research and i came across a case in the supreme court now
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:52.600]  saying uh about the straw purchase i said to the atf all along i said sometimes i thought maybe they're
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:57.080]  buying for the cop he's not prohibited so that's not a straw purchase they're saying well yeah there
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:02.360]  is a straw purchase i'm like that's rubbish because if a husband buys a gun for a wife well that's
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:08.200]  a straw purchase i've had many customers do that if you follow the case of garcia versus us in los
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:13.720]  cruces the atf agent actually gets up there and says a straw purchase is for someone who buys a gun
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:19.080]  for someone who can't not someone who's legally allowed to own one and that's what's in the supreme
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:25.160]  court right now that they're going back and forth that sure it's the illegal intent to get somebody
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:32.040]  a gun who can't get one i can buy my son a gun i can buy my dad a gun he can buy me guns we i mean
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:37.240]  my dad's giving me probably five guns over my life and in their view that is a straw purchase and
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:41.240]  that's what's going back right yeah they want to make everything illegal and the supreme court
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:46.920]  better not rule that way sir give out your website one more time we want to get you back on thank you

[02:09:01.880 --> 02:09:06.920]  i'm going to get into all the other news i haven't covered yet we've got dr busby the nuclear and
[02:09:06.920 --> 02:09:14.600]  chemical physicists joining us tomorrow over the major university studies and government models
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:20.280]  predicting that all the major runoff of fukushima and subsequent meltdowns would begin hitting in
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:29.960]  early january 2014 we are now here we are now there and they are reporting and confirming
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:34.600]  with the county health department environmental services that their geiger counters are showing
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:39.880]  exactly what citizens scores of videos in san francisco and surrounding areas are showing
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:45.480]  on the coastline it's supposed to be a 14 on the digital monitor we have a little broken down that's
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:53.800]  the average ambient it goes to 150 200 250 300 depending on what area of the california coast
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:59.720]  well we're going to go to oregon we're going to go to seattle washington as well i'm going to send
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:07.160]  my reporters in the next 48 hours out to san francisco they'll spend a day in around san
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:15.240]  francisco gathering data then they will go up the coast of california um thursday and friday
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:24.280]  checking things into origan saturday and sunday they will go into washington state and then on
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:29.960]  monday and tuesday they will survey things there in washington state and up to the canadian border
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:37.160]  and then return back here to austin texas and the reason i'm saying that is we're planning all this
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:42.360]  on the fly and i had rob do is i was going live here during the intro asking me uh the schedule
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:48.040]  after the show i will meet with the crew and i will go over the schedule and what we're going to do
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:55.320]  but we're going to have jacari jackson don salazar and we're going to have two of the camera folks
[02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:00.600]  josh owens and others are going to be there we're going to have live feeds via skype live
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:07.240]  uploads and archived uploads of info wars news dot com to youtube uh we're going to uh have them
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:13.240]  on the nightly news showing what's happening at fish markets uh not just in california and in
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:19.400]  origan and in washington but also here in austin i'm sending crew out tomorrow we're not going to
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:25.320]  sit back and let the dinosaur media shut this down and not have this information come out the local
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:30.760]  health department admits that they found the exact readings with their digital geiger counters that
[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:37.000]  citizens are finding and it's crazy you're 300 yards away on these videos going up over the hill
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:42.920]  and the radiation's already double what it should be you go over the hill it's triple you walk towards
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:51.560]  the beach it's four times boom it's five times boom it's six times boom it's seven times i mean that
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:12:01.480]  is just amazing to watch this going on and it's total silence obama said last year it's safe
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:07.960]  because radiation levels were already going up double if he said it he is god and if you think
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:11.960]  obama care is expensive you're a racist and if you don't want to turn your guns in you're a racist
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:17.000]  and if you don't want to ship guns in mexico to kill people so it can be blamed on you you're a racist
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:21.080]  and if you don't like being lied to and and being deindustrialized i was just watching congressional
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:29.720]  hearings with uh harry reid and chucky schumer and other slime bags uh in the senate and they were
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:35.720]  busy oh record unemployment record we're really in a depression oh big government's the answer they're
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:43.640]  doing it all on purpose cloward and piven it's just one of their strategies these people are sick
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:50.680]  scum okay and they don't even care that fukushima was built on a fault line on a coastline with
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:56.600]  tsunamis and it's now sinking into the mud let's go to your phone calls dr davis then laurene uh
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:03.640]  then we're going to go to uh billy paul robin okay dr davis says trained in nuclear warfare
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:10.200]  is a navy l t d com i'm not sure what that designation means but uh we've had those folks on
[02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:16.760]  before uh so dr davis what is your take on all this well thank you alex um retired as a lieutenant
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:22.520]  commander i was a dual designated flight surgeon and hyperbaric officer i was backup flight
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:29.080]  surgeon for the blue angels work with team five out in coronado uh had a lot of detours on uh
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:34.440]  nuclear ships so i had the special training in nuclear biological and chemical warfare
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:40.600]  as part of my significant additional training that i had as part of my dual designation status
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.200]  one of only 26 officers at the time and had ever gone through that expensive amount of training
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:51.800]  so some people would consider me an expert i don't consider myself an expert because you know
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:55.640]  that was not my primary job sure i understand but you can certainly speak to it what do you
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:59.240]  what do you think's going on here i mean certainly this should be a news issue
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:04.680]  well of course i think one of the things that's that you've brought up in the past that i haven't
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:12.440]  heard lately is that every nuclear reactor in the world has a fingerprint they all have a unique
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:18.280]  spectrum of alpha particles beta particles you know see you literally all of your very well said
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:22.920]  you've got you've got the county saying we don't know if it comes from Fukushima they knew day
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:28.120]  one what was going on in the reactor by the different isotopes that were released that's
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:32.600]  why they knew that plutonium had been released because of the isotopes and they knew fission had
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:38.440]  occurred during that big explosion at the mox3 reactor according to the physicists i had on
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:44.120]  exactly so when they say they don't know they're full of it go ahead so it may be that they would
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:51.000]  be like mist when mist was asked whether any explosives were used in 9-11 they said we found
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:56.600]  no evidence of explosives and then they were asked did you look and they said no
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:05.000]  yes it may be the same kind of you know uh mismanagement and but i doubt it i think that
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.360]  these people probably know absolutely what's going on and they're simply not providing the
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:17.400]  public with this information and it'd be so easy to do any mass spec to see equipment at any laboratory
[02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:23.400]  worth its salt to determine those fingerprints pretty easily and it's not difficult to understand
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.320]  where this material is coming from well sure i mean two and a half years ago when it was first
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:33.960]  hitting us in high levels uh all the universities picked up two three four five six ten fifteen
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:38.280]  twenty times depending on the isotope they had a whole list of it and suddenly the feds came in
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:43.320]  and they didn't release the info anymore well the feds aren't god we have a right to know what's
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:50.920]  hitting our coastline and we have a right to you know know mitigating ways to protect ourselves
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:55.000]  like you notice government's buying iodine but not telling the public to do it why do you think
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:02.040]  that is i think that they realize that there are certain people that again has a situation
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:08.760]  in their employ and that they want to try and protect those people without having to basically
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:15.000]  tell the public to to to protect themselves i mean unfortunately over time i have listened
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.120]  and learned from you and many others i do believe that we're under a genocidal operation in this
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:26.360]  world which is sad to say it was probably the most difficult thing for me to come to believe
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:31.320]  because it just is hard to imagine but when you understand the psychopathy of these people and
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:36.920]  what they're up to it would make sense as part of the rest of the spectrum of all of the soft kill
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:42.280]  that they're doing simultaneously to us as a population whether it's king trails king of
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:48.920]  the houses you know florida or all these other things why not why not provide radiation i mean
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:55.320]  why not just one more you know uh you chip in the gun i mean well that's it i mean a history's full
[02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:01.080]  of the psychopathy that you talk about are meaning the type of criminal sick mind where they act the
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:06.440]  same that's why criminologists are able to catch bad guys is because these people are are types
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:10.840]  they it's like good guys do certain things bad guys do certain things there's different types of
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:15.880]  good guys there's different types of bad guys they know how to assess things and i'm getting chills
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:20.280]  when i say this really bad ones folks because what you just said is so true if you look at the mindset
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:31.720]  of these globalist they literally fit the the mo of demons literal demons psychopathy is among the
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:38.600]  most difficult disorders to spot the psychopath can appear normal even charming uh underneath they
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:45.480]  lack conscious empathy making them manipulative volatile and often but by no means always criminal
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:52.600]  they are an object of popular fascination and clinical anguish and psychopathy is largely in
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:57.880]  pervious to treatment it is important to note that the vast majority of people with antisocial
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.440]  tendencies are not psychopaths no they're they're sociopaths so they have personality disorders
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:08.600]  but but when you get into really dark psychopaths they describe it and i've interviewed top psychiatrist
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.920]  who that famous lady i forget her name who's the one that's interviewed all the famous killers
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:18.440]  for whatever reason she they talk to her they're totally depressed it's and like in hell with
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:23.240]  nightmares and imagine demons attacking them this is what you don't hear in the news but this is in
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:28.920]  the deep criminology until they murder innocent people or do bad things then it's like white light
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:34.120]  and they're so happy when they're doing bad things and hurting people so we see people lined up being
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:41.560]  shot by nazis as horrible but to the psychos doing it it was beautiful ketler would go to the front
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:46.200]  when they attack poland and stay up for three days on amphetamines to watch through telescopes
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:51.640]  stuka bombers burning and people jumping out of buildings and he would get dangerously close
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:56.840]  up to the front lines because he was so he loved world war one he won the congressional medal of
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:02.200]  honor the the german type first class the iron cross first class is the congressional medal of
[02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:07.720]  honor i mean he was a quote war hero because we all know in war most people do it because of family
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:12.440]  because of honor because of history because of instinct to protect because they want to be real
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:19.640]  men but that minority are in the military probably six seven percent are psychopaths who think it's
[02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:26.040]  beautiful to torture and kill anything else doctor well but the one thing that i would add is that
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:32.040]  and you've brought this up since you started uh your broadcasts and that is this dna sampling
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:38.920]  that occurs at birth and we now know that psychopaths are wired differently their brains
[02:19:38.920 --> 02:19:43.560]  are actually different than normal it's genetic and they can identify it you know and i'm gonna
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:47.480]  skip this network break this is too important too important i'm gonna the only one i'm doing this
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:53.000]  week i'm skipping too many of these go ahead and make your point you're absolutely right i believe
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:58.680]  that they are self-selecting at birth they're identifying people that are psychopaths they
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:20:04.440]  follow them they certainly have advanced technology as you've talked about and they would make overtures
[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:09.400]  to these people at the appropriate times in your life to bring them in and to make them their
[02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:15.000]  minions whether they want to make them part of an nk ultra type of mind control program or
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.240]  or put them in various positions of authority move them up the ladder quickly place them in
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:23.800]  corporations place them in military oh no no we know they do that for 41 years they've been
[02:20:23.800 --> 02:20:29.000]  secretly worldwide declassified eight years ago via lawsuits that i helped initiate minnesota and
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:35.960]  texas i'm not bragging a nurse 15 16 years ago gave me secret documents out of an army base uh no
[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:41.160]  it was an air force base in san Antonio and and and when i called the health department they flipped
[02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:46.680]  out but they take blood at birth not for a blood test that's all a lie it's then put in in global
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:51.880]  databases and indeed sir they're doing that and beyond they've had cases now where someone goes
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:57.800]  into have a genetic gene therapy and they go sorry the blood taken at birth from you and a case in
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:02.040]  san francisco many years ago was a famous case four years ago that came out that this woman had
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:06.200]  been born 30 something years ago and they said you've got to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
[02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:15.000]  for the treatment we took your blood and put a patent in on your protein dna structure and now
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:21.240]  you have to pay us so so there's no doubt sir you're absolutely right they have built a legion
[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:27.800]  of doom with psychological test and then dna testing they are building an army of satanist
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:34.520]  an army of devil worshipers an army of psychopaths an army of evil how do you counter something like
[02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:38.920]  that and then they're going to have robots and drones that'll follow orders and then the psychopaths
[02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:45.000]  are going to be dealt with as well i mean how do you face something like that well i i think that
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:51.560]  you know you being a student of history you will know that the one key weakness of every tyranny
[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:57.720]  and they all follow as you said an archetype they all follow the same basic path the one thing that
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:04.520]  a tyrant cannot resist is to centralize his power because that allows him to completely dominate
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:11.560]  he doesn't share power he centralizes it but that is the key weakness of any tyranny that's why they
[02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:17.320]  always collapse because the more dominating they become the more powerful the more centralized
[02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:23.640]  the control the more easily it is broken it is tapped into because there will always be patriots
[02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:28.280]  there will people that will ultimately wake up and they will realize just like the people that
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:33.320]  tried to kill hitler and assassinate him it's i was about to raise operation valkyrie where they
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:39.560]  use the centralized system from the same page they use the centralized system of martial law
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:43.880]  against him and it almost worked and that's why tyrants get overthrown is they always build the
[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:48.520]  system that makes them unstable themselves and even if it's patriots that overthrow them
[02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:54.200]  other would be tyrants overthrow them things then degenerate and then patriots finally get a shot
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:23:01.240]  at things well that's where our edges as you said we have the moral high ground and we have
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:08.040]  God on our side we have the tools to be able to win this battle unfortunately it's going to have
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:13.800]  to get worse in my opinion before it gets better but it's a battle that will be won it's always been
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:19.560]  won in history these guys just have more complex technology that's all they don't have any different
[02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:24.680]  mindset and they have a will of to take power when the average person doesn't want to run people's
[02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:32.520]  lives the average person is confident and happy and secure and a loner that's right but these guys
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:38.520]  they insist on having total domination like I said but that is their fundamental weakness
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:43.560]  and that's what always brings them down that's what's going to bring this globalist cycle a
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:51.000]  tyranny I just hope Alex I hope that this time when this cycle runs its course that we will
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:57.800]  simply not go back and replace this tyranny with another which we've done time and time again and
[02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:03.080]  we may not make it through another cycle because we've got such powerful weapons now I mean we
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:09.800]  can't let elites go crazy and marry their horses and dress up like werewolves and murdered children
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:17.000]  at roman feast like Nero I mean we cannot put up with Aztecs chopping hearts out and druids
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.840]  sacrificing children a psychopaths always tend to get control in society and then they always
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:29.320]  demand total control and and and it's a fact of the web they weave nika one of our producers was
[02:24:29.320 --> 02:24:33.080]  saying if you ever want to go public with who you are and send us your info you could be a guest
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:38.680]  sometime you sound like a smart fella and so we're going to get your info dr. davis if you want to
[02:24:38.680 --> 02:24:43.720]  be a guest sometime on the show and send us your info god bless you thank you bet very interesting
[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:47.960]  smart guy and that's what's so crazy when you talk to somebody who knows what they're talking about
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:53.640]  and you know what they know and you know we need somebody who's well spoken and calm like he is
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:57.720]  I start hearing this stuff and I know it I start getting chills I start getting upset
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:03.160]  because I'm not a psychopath folks I'm red-blooded I love men women and children I love progress I
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:09.000]  love justice and I hate these psychopaths I want to crush them and and it's so horrible to see them
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.160]  run our whole society they don't even care of reactors are melting down and they're lying to
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:17.160]  everybody and everything's going to hell in a handbasket and they run our culture and that
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:20.840]  they're breaking up our families and they're turning men into little demons and women into
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:26.600]  Jezebel arrogant people I mean it's just all the numbers are there not just what we see the
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:32.600]  numbers we're falling apart and I don't like it I you know I was thinking about how I'm going to go
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:42.200]  to my uncle's funeral tomorrow in east Texas and how my dad's great uncle
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:50.280]  uncle Normie's what they called him it was Earl Simmons big combat vet world war two whole nine
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:55.240]  yards great guy out in east Texas and I was thinking about my grandfather Jerry Jones and I was
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:26:00.920]  thinking about just in that plot I think I think he bought like 14 of them he walked by and it's
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:06.920]  like every one of these people was like basically a war hero every one of them was a great guy in life
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:17.000]  so cool so nice so smart so many of them were like in black operations fighting communist
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:22.280]  and I'm just sitting there looking now my uncle shot down six times in vietnam
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:29.000]  you know fighting with the montany yards he made his main job was they took the best helicopter
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.080]  pilots and had him mainly deliver special forces of course we never knew any of that till we dug
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:39.080]  into his army trunk when he was at work one time me and my cousin he was so sweet so smart so good
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:47.560]  so funny um worked in Guatemala after that and other places and became a big Christian and got
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.360]  out of the system and was just a humble person that you know worked as a beekeeper and as a
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:56.680]  delivery truck driver and stuff like that and and and he's just dead boom gone like that
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:00.520]  and the last person on earth I thought would have been you know be gone from us at 68
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:04.760]  and I just look back on all these honorable men that are just lined up and my grandmother and
[02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:10.280]  others that were great people she was such a great lady as well all dead my ancestors there
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.600]  and I think what would they think about what the world's come turning into today
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:20.920]  and you know my uncle William Farris Hammond we're gonna break and come back with your calls
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.200]  everything priming me my experience is growing up seeing the police deal drugs having family that
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:33.800]  was involved with the john birch society being aware of how things worked as I grew up that's why
[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:41.800]  I was on air by the time I was 21 almost 22 and then my uncle was that critical person there that
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:47.960]  really had the inside knowledge and who told me how stuff really worked just the 10 times or so
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:54.280]  I'd go spend a week with him and my cousins uh at summer or uh when he got injured down in
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:58.680]  Guatemala and got sent back up here to the hospital he lived with us for a few months when I was uh
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:05.960]  I think I was about nine years old and he was a big influence on me and I want to be an influence
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:12.360]  on other people I want to beat the tyrants I want to be a good person I want to go to space I want
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:19.160]  humanity to be successful I don't want a bunch of narcissistic lying scum that runs our society
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:25.480]  all these gangsters and thugs and con artists and scammers that just infest everything and then
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:31.400]  have accentuated a culture of decadence show that there's a criminal culture and no one resists them
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:39.720]  no one cares to even lift a hand against them and so they've just have been absolutely empowered
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:46.360]  to have the fake moral high ground look at Al Gore with all his global warming bs you've got
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:51.720]  serious issues with our atmosphere from nuclear testing serious problems with the biosphere
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:56.520]  there is major weather modification it's called geoengineering on purpose they're messing with
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:03.400]  it very destructively oh no none of that matters just just pay money for carbon that's at record low
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:12.440]  in our atmosphere record low carbon dioxide in the history of the world it's it's like thank god
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:16.520]  we were putting carbon out because that may actually boost it that's what the real studies show
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:23.720]  versus their carbon tax where they have the moral high ground and and take over our society
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:31.800]  while ignoring thousands of real environmental issues it's so frustrating as a culture to see
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:37.000]  this happening and to see how weak I am compared to the generation before me and how weak they were
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:41.240]  compared to the generation before that and I'm not romanticizing these people you couldn't have this
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:48.920]  level of tyranny here because old timers would not put up with it and it's just where are the men

[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:45.320]  that the reason why everyone's hushed up about this is um i was listening to these interviews
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:51.560]  by uh a japanese scientist uh yoichi shimatsu over in japan that's been reporting weekly
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:58.600]  on the rent dot com news um network they've been doing updates every week for i guess
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:05.240]  since the the whole Fukushima thing happened and um one more earthquake um they said that
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:11.880]  japan is as good as gone and that you might as well evacuate all of california and the western
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:16.200]  united states and you know that's not going to happen sure sure that was uh that was david
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:21.800]  Suzuki the uh physicist uh who said that about a month ago and i have followed the reported job
[02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:27.480]  there on Fukushima uh it's been it's been excellent anything else well the one thing
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:32.840]  that i'm concerned about i've got a couple of points is um you know i'm up in santa rosa california
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:40.760]  about 60 miles north of san francisco and we are not being told anything and same thing i try and
[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:45.880]  you know post uh readings to facebook i try and tell people and they just kind of look at me like
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:50.920]  huh what are you talking about well that's because they're in a trance don't feel sorry i mean don't
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:55.880]  be mad at them feel sorry for them because they literally are victims of mind control you've got
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:01.960]  to break through that to them go ahead oh i know and we're fighting the uh we're one of the last
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:08.200]  cities that doesn't have a fluoride in our water and we're fighting it so we don't want any more
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:14.200]  people put to sleep and poisoned but um anyway down here where the mavericks uh surf point is um
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:19.480]  down by san matel california they don't have the big surf contest earlier there was a guy
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:27.400]  that posted on the rent radio um not one i guess radio show too but um about five uh feet off the
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:37.000]  ground he was getting readings uh about christmas eve of 160 156 cpm and then he went back four days
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:44.520]  later and held the uh i think what did he use he used an inspector plus geiger counter two winters
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:52.120]  off the sand and got 412 cpm yeah i know it's it's incredible and 400 would be 400 would be
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:37:01.480]  400 would be like what 10 15 no no like 20 times the regular levels if 14's normal what would 400
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:08.760]  be thank you for the call i appreciate your call uh let's talk to billy in california billy you're
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:15.560]  on the air go ahead and now thanks for covering this i think it's right now one of the biggest
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:21.960]  threats to the world right now is the disaster and the fallout from fukushima but it's also
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:27.560]  psychologically it also psychologically though shows how much mind control we're under and how
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:32.600]  controlled the mainstream media is that the san francisco health department admits five times the
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:39.240]  radiation level and says it's no big deal go ahead absolutely i mean there is a video and
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:44.200]  there's been videos out um on youtube there's one in huntington beach where i live i live in
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:48.520]  huntington beach california it's in southern california pretty close to uh the power plant in
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:54.680]  san anofri um but a video that kelp radiation testing in huntington beach and it's spiking
[02:37:54.680 --> 02:38:00.920]  over 100 this was last year um somebody is is out there testing so even in huntington
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:05.960]  beach and southern california there's huge fallout i haven't surfed for a year and if you're not
[02:38:05.960 --> 02:38:11.240]  taking the nason iodine and you live down here you're crazy well that's the issue is that i was
[02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:15.560]  checking with medical doctors and others about giving my children the therosafe and they said you
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:20.360]  can't do that really long term it's good if it's really high level like it is coming in now the
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:27.320]  next heavier waves and that's why we sell uh the therosafe and infowarsstore.com and infowarslife.com
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:33.640]  i mean it's better than nothing but people need the true nascent so that it's more uh soothing to
[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:39.400]  the body not as toxic not as raw and it's a win-win then you fund their operation as well but
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:45.320]  everybody on the west coast particularly needs to be on some form of iodine check with your
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:49.560]  physician i'm not going to tell you what to do even though this is a no-brainer in the FDA and
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:54.520]  everybody says you know people should be on iodine uh it's just this is something people need to
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:39:00.040]  look into the feds are getting it the feds are on it the feds are on it in the west coast the feds
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:03.960]  know what's going on and they don't want the public to know because they don't want to create a panic
[02:39:03.960 --> 02:39:08.680]  well in the old days in europe they did with Chernobyl even the old soviet union didn't cover
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:15.000]  it up like this anything else sir yeah i've been on it for two months i mean it was a no-brainer for
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:20.600]  me i was a a year veteran in the navy and they taught us the benefits of iodine i mean it can
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:26.360]  purify water in a feted stream it can save your life and i've been on it since you put it out
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:31.240]  i've been a surfer you know like i said i haven't been surfing for a year and and these guys are
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:36.360]  crazy i can't believe they're out there surfing in that water when 98 percent of the ocean floor now
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.600]  is full of dead creatures up from one percent before Fukushima you know i forgot that headline
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:48.440]  areas of japan and the west coast have 90 dead guys type in 90 percent i think it's 90 percent
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:53.800]  that's 98 percent of pacific floor dead uh show that article and source from last week
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:58.600]  well said sir god bless you we're going to go back to more calls after leon macadoo's report
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:04.680]  we're going to talk to paul uh and robin and then drew and others that are patiently holding
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:10.280]  there it is study dead sea creatures cover 98 percent of ocean floor off california coast
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:15.400]  up from one percent before Fukushima and that's from naturalnews.com and if you scroll down at
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:19.080]  the bottom of the article it'll have the source i want to give people the source of that i mean i
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:23.800]  believe it it's a very reputable site but i want to i want to get people the source that's pna s
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:31.880]  and news watch and um go to pna s i believe that's a government organization or
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.760]  university i forget exactly but the point is is that this is some pretty wild stuff deep ocean
[02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:44.520]  communities impacted by changing climate over 24 year and abysmal northeast pacific ocean
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:50.280]  and then it goes so they're saying it's climate it's the radiation uh but let's uh now shift gears
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:56.040]  out of radiation for a moment and the story that's on info wars dot com Fukushima's radioactive
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:00.840]  second wave hitting california local officials with the health department in san francisco say a
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:06.520]  500 increase in radiation is of no concern and they don't know where to find out where it came from
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:11.960]  even though even somebody like me who isn't a physicist knows they can test the isotopes
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.280]  and they can test the breakdown isotopes and they can tell exactly where it came from because
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:22.120]  there's a listing of the isotopes that came out of Fukushima as that the former naval commander
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:27.320]  earlier was saying that's what all the physicists have said here they know fission occurred there
[02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:33.240]  dr busby said and three months after he was on they admitted there was explosions not full atomic
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:38.520]  explosions but fission that was not just hydrogen explosions when those things blew 3000 feet in the
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:45.400]  air now leon macadoo is in downtown austin reporting for info wars nightly news and the radio show
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:54.680]  today live at 141 central and she came across this weekend folks down there with fluoride free
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:59.080]  austin and others and they're doing a hunger strike i think they're in today eight or nine right now
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:04.600]  to draw attention to the fact that we've had medical doctors scientists top toxicologists top
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:11.400]  professors uh like dr connet come to the city council and then they turn their backs and laugh
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:17.480]  at him even though harvard study confirms fluoride reduces children's IQ that's out of roiders okay
[02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:24.040]  so cancer reduced IQs and you go and say get it out of my water and the disgusting criminal city
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:27.560]  council some of them are starting to listen but those that are against it are criminal
[02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:33.560]  they're forcibly medicating us with toxic poison they literally will not respond so these people
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:39.880]  are heroes leon macadoo out there freezing in the global warming uh i need to pay more carbon taxes
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:46.760]  to al gore how are you doing out there in the record heatwave uh thanks i can't i i'm freezing my
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:51.720]  butt off my lips can barely move but i i can't complain because i've got a nice hot meal and a
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:57.560]  warm bed to go home to these guys i've been out here for eight days it's 20 degrees here today
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:03.400]  it's going to be even colder tomorrow and these guys are heroes they're standing up to say it's
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:09.400]  enough is enough why are you putting hydrofluorosalic acid in our drinking water so i'm standing here
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:15.160]  in front of austin city hall it's a very busy intersection here in downtown austin not a lot
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:20.840]  of foot traffic but these guys are definitely making a big impact with their sign they are on
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:26.440]  and these guys actually aren't with fluoride free austin they are with austin fluoride hunger strike
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:30.680]  so that's their facebook page you can find austin fluoride hunger strike that's also the
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:36.280]  change.org petition by the way we could change history right now if 50 more people came and
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.160]  joined them and spent a day with them every day leon we should send you out there every day for
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:47.320]  an update and and and we should tomorrow um guys find a 20 minute opening sometime in the show
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:53.000]  we should send leon down there again tomorrow and tell folks to rally down there against fluoride

[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:14.680]  dollars a year or more for toxic chinese toxic waste to be dumped in our water it's not just
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:21.560]  hydrofluorosalic acid it's time to let the crux that are in there know that we are standing strong
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:26.680]  i want to see everybody go down there and support these guys help them hand out their flyers even

[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:07.080]  the city of austin know that we're quite aware that you are slow killing us with poison in the tap
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:12.120]  water and the more people we can get out here they're gonna have to report this no media has
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:17.160]  come here to report on this it's just us we're the only ones out here and these cars they're not just
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:23.960]  gonna hunger strike until friday they're planning on doing this until the 23rd of january when austin
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:29.480]  city hall they're gonna have their first meeting and they're gonna be on hunger strike god willing
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:36.280]  until the 23rd and uh hope that we can get some a resolution or get something but basically so you
[02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:41.000]  guys are just out here wanting to draw attention to the fact that they are poisoning our tap water
[02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:47.400]  and to just get people to sign this petition at change.org give us their names uh this is jason
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:53.320]  and nicolas so how do you guys feel there's all these people driving by they're looking at the sign
[02:45:53.320 --> 02:45:56.840]  you know and some of them are kind of looking like what are they talking about these guys are
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:01.640]  crazy to be starving themselves how does it make you feel knowing that you're doing this for them
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:07.400]  um i mean it definitely feels good regardless of the reaction that we receive because we know
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:13.240]  deep down that it is the right thing to do and we are just hoping that just through awareness
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:18.600]  that more people join our side a lot of people are supporting them i saw a city truck honk in
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:22.520]  support i mean what ratio of support are they getting i know most people are zombies and say
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:27.240]  nothing but what ratio of support what would you say is the ratio of support of people do you have
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:32.200]  people really kind of showing you they're they're on board with this yeah i'd say it's about five to
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:38.120]  one positive to negative um it's a good turnout we've had people bring us out water uh tea from
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:43.720]  very nice people thank you hot cocoa coffee um it's really been nice to support we've gotten
[02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:48.840]  and so you are actually speaking with the city of austin prior to going on this hunger strike what
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:52.680]  sort of things were they were they saying to you when you asked them why were they actively
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:57.880]  putting hydrofluorosalic acid in the water well they've been presented for five years presentations
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:02.440]  at city council meetings and special hearings on the topic so they're well aware of all the
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:07.560]  information they've just failed to act um we really just gave them the press release that we
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.800]  were going to be out here and just made sure we had good communication with the police and city hall
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:16.520]  to let them know of our intentions and be respectful in that matter um but really we haven't had any
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:20.600]  conversation with them whatsoever they haven't been responsive we're in their front yard and they
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:25.240]  act like we're not here and so what's been their reaction here it's day eight you are out here in
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:29.960]  their front yard now what are they saying to you that you you're on this hunger strike um they're
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:33.960]  still pretty silent about it we've actually been invited to participate in an international
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:39.240]  teleconference and so we went ahead and extended the invitation to them to sit in next sunday with us
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:43.800]  and that's an international teleconference uh for anti-fluoridization in the water correct it's
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:47.720]  with fluoride action network and by the way i want to say something to all the audience out there
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:53.480]  and repeat it these guys the reason they try to hold the line is we're defluoridating all over
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:58.440]  europe all over canada all over the u.s states are trying to come down with state laws to make
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:04.680]  you do it we're going to win on gmo's on fluoride on radiation on everything the same people that are
[02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:10.280]  the opposite of psychopaths we care we want a future for humanity we are going to take control
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:15.720]  of the future for liberty and free will and these people are literal paul reveres and so all
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:23.160]  it folks to come down and support them today and 11 30 tomorrow they're better be 200 or 300 people
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:30.120]  down there with leon macadoo because because i want folks i want to make a big issue out of this
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:34.760]  and i want to see even more people next week at city council this is an example for all over the
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:39.880]  country but notice now they're getting on radio shows teleconferences in the media this is getting
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:43.880]  out in the alternative media that is the real media just like the radiation waves hitting
[02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:49.320]  california and the west coast no one's reporting it but us now it's national news thanks to drugs
[02:48:49.320 --> 02:48:57.000]  report dot com we are the real media we are the the the folks that want freedom um i get their
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:02.840]  take on the march against fluoride so what is your take on the march against fluoride do you
[02:49:02.840 --> 02:49:10.600]  think we're doing enough here in austin um i feel that there definitely has been a more
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:18.280]  um awareness been brought and i we do appreciate the efforts that everyone has made before us and
[02:49:18.280 --> 02:49:24.680]  has definitely helped us be informed as well but the process in general is very slow and people
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:30.520]  are still drinking this water daily bathing in this water and it's still in most store-bought goods
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:38.120]  and we feel that slowness is causing us harm and it needs to be done immediately and this
[02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:44.120]  is the perfect time it's a brand new year new year's resolution well i want to explain something here
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:51.240]  five to one support folks okay now we're the majority we pay the taxes the little punks
[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.480]  the authoritarian eugenicists that's what they are the austin city council is a very high level
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:00.520]  u n group of scum they need to get on notice with lawsuits and a lot more if you live next door to
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:05.320]  them go over and tell them you want the fluoride out we have to go through hell with filters not
[02:50:05.320 --> 02:50:09.800]  to drink this poison because of these arrogant jackasses that know full and i have to know
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:15.400]  the mayor and others filter their water i mean no folks that know them they know what they're doing
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:21.560]  and they're scum and so get their take on that that five to one support why is the water still
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:26.440]  why are they still doing it so why do you think there's still there's still fluoride in the water
[02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:30.840]  i know one of the biggest groups here that's trying to get a fluoride free austin they're
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:34.760]  their first thing they're really just trying to drive is just get warning labels put on the water
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:39.880]  but that's not going far enough isn't oh no even on their website on austin the government's website
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:45.320]  of the city of austin they warn against children under the age of two drinking too much fluoride
[02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:50.840]  because it will cause fluorosis in children and the cdc knew this they they gave a leeway of 10
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:55.000]  percent of children coming down with fluorosis and that was acceptable that is unacceptable

[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:24.360]  starting to explain the uh physicists i spoke to uh when uh fu kashima first went off and they
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:29.640]  weren't too concerned about it but uh recently spoke to them again and they're like uh yeah don't
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:35.720]  go on the beach and don't go in the water and don't eat the fish and i asked them why and they said
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:43.560]  well because you know the radiation is pretty high now so this is people who are extremely smart
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:49.000]  and know what's going on and again it's killing the fish and starfish because they eat eat eat eat
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:56.520]  and it bio accumulates and builds up exactly and uh you know like i was saying these people are
[02:57:56.520 --> 02:58:01.960]  extremely smart and they're they're like well known in their fields for what they do so they're
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:06.920]  coming from reputable people it's like yeah don't don't eat the fish out here and don't eat the sushi

[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:22.120]  my friends
[03:08:22.120 --> 03:08:34.200]  we are facing an emergency situation with radiation levels in japan and now with the new wave of
[03:08:34.200 --> 03:08:43.000]  radiation hitting the west coast and on this monday the sixth day of january 2014 we have
[03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  a decision to make as citizens not just of the united states but citizens of planet earth on
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:53.560]  whether we're going to let the psychopaths and the control freaks and the nihilists that are
[03:08:53.560 --> 03:09:00.600]  running things continue to endanger the entire planet while posing as the planet's savior
[03:09:01.400 --> 03:09:07.400]  trying to tax and control carbon dioxide so they can regulate all human activity while 91 percent
[03:09:07.400 --> 03:09:11.400]  of nuclear reactors worldwide in a un study last year are leaking
[03:09:11.400 --> 03:09:20.360]  all troops for 25 years have been using depleted uranium which they had since the end of world
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:25.000]  war two but wouldn't let the military use because it's a death sentence to whoever fires it
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:31.000]  because the the round catches on fire and you get a heavy dose of the poisonous radioactive
[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:38.920]  garbage here's the headline fukushima radioactive wave has already hit california the radiation's
[03:09:38.920 --> 03:09:45.000]  up five fold the normal background radiation on average the county health department went out there
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:53.400]  and i have the article here in my stack and when they got there they found the same levels
[03:09:53.400 --> 03:09:57.400]  and admit it but say they don't know if it's coming from fukushima well they better find
[03:09:57.400 --> 03:10:03.000]  out where it's coming from it's obviously coming from fukushima fox news reported along with the
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:11.320]  spanish government in november of last year that the main waves of radiation from the ongoing leaks
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:17.240]  were set to arrive in early january it's now happening here's another headline health officials
[03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:24.680]  no concern over 500 increase in radiation levels and there have been a lot of people
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:31.720]  since march three years ago who have been following this and there was a first initial wave
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:36.840]  in the air of hot particles and radiation and increased radiation and milk and vegetables
[03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:41.880]  that grow on the surface where it bio accumulates in the fallout now the fish the starfish are
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:47.000]  almost all dying it's all over the news but not why they're dying the sea lions are dying the
[03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:53.320]  currents come right off fukushima right around up around north america all the way up to alaska
[03:10:53.320 --> 03:10:59.480]  whether you live in alaska canada the west coast of the us or northern mexico you're getting hammered
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:06.600]  by an ongoing five reactor meltdown where they're just spraying ocean water on it in that wreck
[03:11:06.600 --> 03:11:14.360]  site that runs right into the ocean and it is getting incredibly serious this is i gotta say
[03:11:14.360 --> 03:11:20.360]  a hundred times worse some of this stuff has you know billion year half lives or more they had a
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:28.920]  plutonium reactor the blue sky high plutonium we're not talking about just uranium this is
[03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:36.200]  incredible and so we as a culture and a society need to get these articles from info wars dot
[03:11:36.200 --> 03:11:42.280]  com we'll click on it to show you the top right hand corner of drugs report dot com we need to get
[03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:47.480]  this article our article that links to the local newspaper where they interviewed the head of the
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:51.160]  health department the head of the environmental section of the health department going oh yeah it
[03:11:51.160 --> 03:11:56.200]  is five times exactly what citizen youtube videos are showing five times the regular level
[03:11:56.200 --> 03:12:06.120]  from a 14 up to 150 and on up some people are getting four hundreds and folks you stay around
[03:12:06.120 --> 03:12:12.040]  that for months you're talking serious health effects from all the physicists that we've interviewed
[03:12:12.040 --> 03:12:21.880]  chemical uh physicist nuclear physicist and they're using radiation levels
[03:12:21.880 --> 03:12:27.560]  you know they're saying this is safe unless you have long term exposure that are that are
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:32.920]  acceptable limits people that work in nuclear power plants not children and others with fast
[03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:40.120]  growing cells this is really bad news and it's the response of these videos being out for weeks
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:46.200]  that the radiation had already gone up but now it's skyrocketing and no one is even covering this
[03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:52.920]  but info wars dot com and drugs report dot com and prison planet dot com there have been a lot of
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:57.720]  citizen journalists activist groups folks out there have been doing a great job you know when it went
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:06.920]  from 14 to 30 and then 60 now it's 150 200 300 400 now the the animals are dying and the establishment
[03:13:06.920 --> 03:13:14.040]  they're not going in the water so you've got major physicists saying japan might have to be
[03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:24.920]  evacuated this is a real issue ladies and gentlemen the government last week quietly
[03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:29.400]  ordered 14 million dosages of potassium iodide now i'm going to go back to your calls and let
[03:13:29.400 --> 03:13:35.080]  folks comment on this drew uh comedic genius and rich that's all we have time for with the calls
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:41.160]  and this overdrive but i just want to recap here that the government's not telling you to get iodine
[03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:44.520]  the government's not telling you to protect yourself there's the headline top scientist
[03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:51.000]  another fukushima quake would mean us evacuation bye bye japan award-winning scientist there's
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:57.000]  another 7.0 earthquake hitting fukushima would mean us evacuations bye bye japan david susuke
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:14:02.120]  remember that a few months ago and then the head of the young turks who was an msnbco said
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:06.840]  they were told to not talk about it but hey we're not sending reporters over there because it's a
[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:13.400]  death sentence i mean this is a big deal ladies and gentlemen you got five of the six reactors that
[03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:19.240]  blew up just sinking down into a swamp now on the edge of the ocean with homeless people being
[03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:25.880]  paid below minimum wage removing the rods they touch one rod they catch on fire and explode it's a
[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:33.640]  time bomb and it should be the number one issue no it's al-qaeda we got to have armored vehicles
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:38.680]  and checkpoints and take your rights because of al-qaeda we've got a spy on congress because
[03:14:38.680 --> 03:14:44.760]  they might be with al-qaeda peter king said that trust no one and arrest everyone but me
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:50.600]  turns out him and john mccain are the two literally funding al-qaeda in syria and other
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:56.760]  areas that go over there and meet with them there's articles out about that today the biggest
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:01.160]  terrorism scare monger are themselves the ones promoting terrorism we're going into a worldwide
[03:15:01.160 --> 03:15:05.640]  depression there's gmo spreading the bees are dying everywhere radiation is exploding and
[03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:09.880]  literally you go to the airport and they're looking for al-qaeda when they run the stinking
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:17.480]  radical muslims out of saudi arabia who it turns out is publicly bombing russia right now because
[03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:24.360]  russia won't hand syria over to them this is disgusting peter king is an absolute dirt bag
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:31.080]  when is it enough of these con artists and their appeal to authority because he's a big pumpkin
[03:15:31.080 --> 03:15:36.760]  headed congressman that we better spy on congress and have no rights and get rid of everything
[03:15:37.480 --> 03:15:41.320]  that's the illegitimate government starting to spy on the elected government as much as i don't
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:46.760]  like the crooks in congress they're the government this is a coup d'etat in our face and i've had
[03:15:46.760 --> 03:15:55.560]  enough we've got breaking explosions fire near time life building oh i hope it's just a gas man
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:16:00.680]  or something i hope that they don't stage some false flag let me tell you they know this is
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:05.000]  breaking and drudge i'm serious they don't want this coming out because they don't want you they
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:09.960]  want to keep building new reactors let them keep melting down they don't want this story breaking
[03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:13.960]  now getting out you've got to make sure it gets out let's go back to drew drew tell folks about

[03:16:53.160 --> 03:16:58.520]  getting cancers uh friend of mine had to have his esophagus and his stomach removed uh he
[03:16:58.520 --> 03:17:04.120]  looked down here in southern oregon uh my cousin got a rare bladder cancer had to have her entire
[03:17:04.120 --> 03:17:09.080]  bladder removed and then they built her a new bladder oh no it's all off the chart i mean all
[03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:17.560]  the numbers we were under plague warfare attack it's real for those that don't know the radio
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:22.200]  active particles settle out in the kidneys and the bladder and the lungs and that's what it hits
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:27.000]  just like with the du and the trips we'll talk to you soon drew all right let's talk to uh comedic
[03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:33.480]  genius go ahead you're monitoring the radiation from california r ground zero go ahead moderate
[03:17:33.480 --> 03:17:39.240]  bay one of your favorite places alex i remember the last time i spoke with you uh we was all
[03:17:39.240 --> 03:17:45.240]  about pointy toes and hands down the pants and the man pig and all these others you know
[03:17:45.240 --> 03:17:49.640]  we've moved on from there anyway you're talking about i came out to speak and the city demanded
[03:17:49.640 --> 03:17:55.800]  they had police searching everyone to go in and see me i wasn't i had tickets but i wasn't at that
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:18:01.000]  one that was with the info wars came out here yeah but uh yeah but anyway what i wanted to
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:07.480]  point out uh information is what's very important at this point and european what that is is my uh
[03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:10.920]  i don't want to like we're almost out of time brother go ahead and make your point okay but
[03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:15.960]  anyway i wanted to suggest this website if you haven't mentioned it already radiation network
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:22.040]  dot com yes it's excellent i want to get their director on as well as they've got all the folks
[03:18:22.040 --> 03:18:26.440]  with the government the university and the private radiation monitors showing the levels
[03:18:26.440 --> 03:18:31.160]  yeah but what but what other thing about that to see like for example my instrument is a
[03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:38.040]  pancake instrument it has been read three times more counts per minute and uh we have to calibrate
[03:18:38.040 --> 03:18:42.520]  our instrumentation and get listening stations like they're trying to do there but make sure the
[03:18:42.520 --> 03:18:47.640]  information is consistent now where i am here my normal count per second is around uh in the width
[03:18:47.640 --> 03:18:52.440]  of instrument three times norm you know what a normal is will be is around 30 and i haven't
[03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:57.240]  experienced this escalation that you've talked about but uh i've seen the youtube reports on it
[03:18:57.240 --> 03:19:03.080]  anyway you're doing a great job and i actually run a water policy non-profit here too for many years
[03:19:03.080 --> 03:19:07.400]  but dealing with another great job brother great job comedic genius rich take us out
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:16.360]  got 30 40 seconds go ahead hello yes rich go ahead yes from california oh hi i'm from uh
[03:19:16.360 --> 03:19:23.160]  down low and it's a you might say a suburb of uh fantastic we only got a 30 seconds what i want

[03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:35.880]  30 years it feels like there's needles sticking in you and um it's quite what it does is it's
[03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:41.720]  painful but it just for two or three minutes you you get very it starts to itch and it's quite
[03:19:41.720 --> 03:19:46.360]  noticeable there's all sorts of stuff in the atmosphere the globalists are trying to kill
[03:19:46.360 --> 03:19:50.600]  the planet while posing as a savior sorry to have to cut you off brother we're out of time
