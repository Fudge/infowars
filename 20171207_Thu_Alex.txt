[00:00.000 --> 00:19.360]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:39.960]  Many times in history big events take place politically and aren't recognized for what's
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.280]  actually happened at that point. Well we're in one of those moments right now I've looked
[00:46.280 --> 00:50.280]  at all the evidence I've studied it you've got all these Democrats senators and house
[00:50.280 --> 00:54.480]  members resigning you've got all these Democrat mayors having to resign for
[00:54.480 --> 00:59.720]  pedophilia it's like 14 of them now you've got Hollywood collapsing the NFL
[00:59.720 --> 01:05.080]  collapsing the EU collapsing socialist globalist political parties collapsing
[01:05.080 --> 01:10.800]  all over the world on four different continents right now. Globalism is in
[01:10.800 --> 01:14.920]  freefall and the FBI under Clinton control trying to cover for all their
[01:14.920 --> 01:19.280]  crimes thinking she'd be president has blown up in their face and the fact
[01:19.280 --> 01:23.200]  that they didn't know when to quit and pull this whole Russiagate thing is just
[01:23.200 --> 01:28.520]  incredible it is in it is absolutely eviscerating them and John Bowne breaks
[01:28.520 --> 01:33.160]  it down in this report busted FBI Democrat could be the final straw that
[01:33.160 --> 01:39.520]  accelerates their collapse. Your mother's FBI what's wrong with the FBI is not the
[01:39.520 --> 01:44.800]  average every day agent they're great it's the management at the FBI that is
[01:44.800 --> 01:49.520]  the problem. Talk about the wolf guarding the henhouse Peter Strugg FBI
[01:49.520 --> 01:54.200]  deputy and Russia expert was recently fired from the Trump collusion
[01:54.200 --> 01:59.000]  investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. Strugg also led the
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.040]  investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server we now know Strugg changed
[02:04.040 --> 02:08.960]  the language describing Clinton's criminal actions as grossly negligent to
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.280]  the softer legal ease of extremely careless. Strugg was assigned to the
[02:13.280 --> 02:17.920]  task of interviewing Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. His notes
[02:17.920 --> 02:22.520]  claim that the women denied knowing anything about Hillary's secret server
[02:22.520 --> 02:28.000]  despite emails proving otherwise. Strugg essentially watered down all of the
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.960]  evidence surrounding Hillary's illegal server and then was the agent
[02:31.960 --> 02:36.880]  responsible for questioning Michael Flynn. But you have to ask yourself given
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.640]  the history of everybody involved in that case who were involved in the
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.800]  Hillary email server case where they conducted a totally irresponsible
[02:46.800 --> 02:51.640]  unprofessional invest criminal investigation and then they turn up the
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.040]  heat on this investigation of Flynn the same agency this is politics the bureau
[02:57.040 --> 03:01.440]  has been politicized. The Justice Department recently verified that Strugg
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.040]  had been exchanging emails insulting President Trump and was engaging in an
[03:06.040 --> 03:10.920]  extramarital affair with Mueller's trial lawyer Lisa Page and that was enough
[03:10.920 --> 03:15.920]  controversy to have Strugg moved to a human resources desk where Devin Nunes
[03:15.920 --> 03:19.280]  pestered Strugg for an interview. All we were doing was sending two of our
[03:19.280 --> 03:22.480]  investigators down there to start to begin to go through the documents to
[03:22.480 --> 03:27.760]  ensure that the documents that we had subpoenaed were provided. When my
[03:27.760 --> 03:32.680]  investigators got there there were four other staff from the other side of the
[03:32.680 --> 03:36.680]  aisle including a member of Congress or the ranking member from our committee
[03:36.680 --> 03:41.600]  which seems to me to be very bizarre behavior since Adam Schiff was there Adam
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.120]  Schiff was there two two Nancy Pelosi staffers were there correct? Yeah so I
[03:46.120 --> 03:49.640]  think here's the here's the bizarre part of it they didn't support the subpoena
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.160]  they said there was no reason to see this documentation so I don't know why
[03:53.160 --> 03:56.200]  they would run down there and be the first people to repeat the information. What does that tell you?
[03:56.200 --> 04:01.640]  Well it tells me that they're very very nervous. Nunes told the Daily Caller
[04:01.640 --> 04:07.440]  this is part of a month's long pattern by the DOJ and FBI of Stonewalling and
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.360]  obstructing the committee's oversight work particularly oversight of their use
[04:12.360 --> 04:16.840]  of the steel dossier. Unfortunately Struck is just one of the Democrats
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.880]  fueling Mueller's witch hunt. The Daily Caller reports at least nine of Mueller's
[04:21.880 --> 04:26.680]  prosecutors have donated to Democratic political candidates and all of the
[04:26.680 --> 04:31.960]  legal actions taken so far in Mueller's investigation have involved pro-Democrat
[04:31.960 --> 04:36.600]  prosecutors. The lawyers working the money laundering case against former
[04:36.600 --> 04:41.720]  Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates have donated
[04:41.720 --> 04:47.120]  to Obama's presidential campaigns. Struck is the face of the infiltration of the
[04:47.120 --> 04:52.080]  deep state upon the federal government a big clue revealing the hordes of Obama
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.840]  and Hillary Clinton loyalists working to undermine the highest office in the
[04:56.840 --> 05:01.680]  land. John Bown reporting for Info. I'm so excited the new product at

[05:22.800 --> 05:27.240]  doctors prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were
[05:27.240 --> 05:32.280]  charging people a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up

[06:05.600 --> 06:11.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[06:11.760 --> 06:31.040]  you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:31.040 --> 06:37.440]  Ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide. I'm Alex Jones
[06:37.440 --> 06:42.120]  your host thank you so much for joining us today Thursday the seventh day of
[06:42.120 --> 06:49.680]  December 2017 we're gonna be live here for the next four hours remember the
[06:49.680 --> 06:53.280]  globalists the multinationals that are anti-free market have been trying to
[06:53.280 --> 06:56.960]  shut down free speech here in America and in Europe they've been trying to
[06:56.960 --> 07:02.640]  adopt communist Chinese style systems of control and they're trying to focus in
[07:02.640 --> 07:07.200]  on info wars and use us as the case point example because they know we are
[07:07.200 --> 07:11.480]  the most effective at alerting the population of the planet to their
[07:11.480 --> 07:16.600]  criminal operations so when you share the local radio station you're listening
[07:16.600 --> 07:20.480]  to or the local TV station you're watching when you spread links to info
[07:20.480 --> 07:27.560]  wars.com and present planet.com and news wars.com it is a revolutionary act when
[07:27.560 --> 07:33.840]  you spread the live links from info wars.com forward slash show when you
[07:33.840 --> 07:38.920]  share the links you're watching live on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or other
[07:38.920 --> 07:44.160]  platforms or restrain them and post them on your Facebook page or Twitter it has
[07:44.160 --> 07:50.000]  a giant effect we're in a war so don't underestimate how vital how critical how
[07:50.000 --> 07:54.840]  absolutely key it is that if you don't spread these links and if you don't
[07:54.840 --> 07:59.160]  reach out to people and tell people about the show the censorship and control
[07:59.160 --> 08:03.600]  will be successful if you spread the word the Streisand effect will kick in
[08:03.600 --> 08:08.280]  that will explode in their face. Streisand effect is if they try to censor
[08:08.280 --> 08:12.240]  somebody and people take interest and spread the word it generally blows up
[08:12.240 --> 08:19.600]  ten times bigger than it would have but now we're up against AI and a lot more
[08:19.600 --> 08:23.480]  so it's really up to all of us and you've been doing it and we've been
[08:23.480 --> 08:26.920]  swimming upstream and having victory here and they're really really getting
[08:26.920 --> 08:30.720]  panicked but we aren't under attacks we need your hope your prayer and your
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.680]  support now more than ever and I know you will do it so for myself my family the
[08:34.680 --> 08:39.040]  crew and everybody else was in this fight together I salute you all because
[08:39.040 --> 08:47.120]  you are the resistance. I can officially say that we've gone from the establishment
[08:47.120 --> 08:55.800]  being in very serious trouble globally to them now being in danger of complete
[08:55.800 --> 09:00.360]  and total absolute implosion we're looking at the death of the new world
[09:00.360 --> 09:06.520]  order the death of the Anglo-American establishment the death of the whole
[09:06.520 --> 09:11.040]  globalist authoritarian system when I say Anglo-American establishment has
[09:11.040 --> 09:15.280]  nothing to do with the Anglos that is the technical term used by the Big
[09:15.280 --> 09:24.840]  Brzezinski and by David Rockefeller and by other top globalist for their
[09:24.840 --> 09:30.600]  global combined system meaning Anglo-American meaning a US British
[09:30.600 --> 09:36.560]  Empire power axis with the particular worldview that's not for the US or the UK
[09:36.560 --> 09:42.040]  but that parlays our power into the world to establish a corporate anti-free
[09:42.040 --> 09:47.880]  market austerity based world government and that is countervailing the
[09:47.880 --> 09:53.400]  American system so that is in deep trouble and what is certainly on the
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.960]  rocks and breaking up and that cannot be put back together again is the
[09:57.960 --> 10:01.480]  Democratic Party the fact that they try to steal the election the fact that they
[10:01.480 --> 10:04.920]  did steal it from Bernie Sanders in the primary the fact that they got caught in
[10:04.920 --> 10:08.520]  the WikiLeaks the fact that the mainstream media went along with it all
[10:08.520 --> 10:14.120]  and the establishment went along with it all irrevocably didn't just blow
[10:14.120 --> 10:20.600]  mortal wounds in the side of the Democrats but mortally wounded
[10:20.600 --> 10:26.600]  politically financially culturally the entire mainstream media dinosaur
[10:26.600 --> 10:33.760]  combined that was already on its last legs and now it has infected their
[10:33.760 --> 10:38.680]  entire global system and it is a chain reaction domino effect all over the
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.960]  world as people become wise to it their entire facade their entire hoax their
[10:43.960 --> 10:48.920]  entire curtain a smoke screen with the man behind it you know running the
[10:48.920 --> 10:53.960]  powerful Oz machine has collapsed there's still a lot of zombies and people
[10:53.960 --> 10:58.040]  that don't notice but everybody that is thinking person is now admitting this is
[10:58.040 --> 11:01.720]  the case and then a worldwide tyranny was being established by very very
[11:01.720 --> 11:07.440]  ruthless people with a eugenics worldview and aim and so the fact that the FBI
[11:07.440 --> 11:14.240]  under Comey and under Mueller are just the poster child children for hubris
[11:14.240 --> 11:22.000]  arrogance narcissistic loon behavior I mean it's just a total confidence game
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.440]  and the way they protected the Clintons on all their different crimes the
[11:26.440 --> 11:32.560]  foundation and uranium one and the secret servers and the lying to Congress
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.080]  and lying to the FBI I mean I'm not gonna and stealing money from the Haitians
[11:37.080 --> 11:44.360]  and being caught smuggling children on airplanes with convicted pedophiles it
[11:44.360 --> 11:47.320]  would take hours to list it all most people start trying to think about the
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.520]  Clintons crimes it makes your head hurt because there's so many examples so
[11:51.520 --> 11:55.920]  pulling back from it the fact that the power structure bet everything on
[11:55.920 --> 11:59.720]  Hillary and the fact that they said if we don't get Hillary in globalism is
[11:59.720 --> 12:04.640]  gonna collapse financial times of London New Yorker magazine Atlantic
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.560]  Monthly all the so-called elite publications all the folks that hijacked
[12:09.560 --> 12:12.880]  America and thought they were invincible a year and a half ago they were
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.240]  saying if Hillary loses it's gonna cause a chain reaction we ought to pull
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.720]  those articles up where they hit the panic button in the Rothschild own
[12:20.720 --> 12:26.000]  economist financial times of London I mean it was hundreds of them said if she
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.960]  goes down it's a chain reaction and boy you weren't lying because they'll lie in
[12:30.960 --> 12:34.560]  mainstream stuff the public in those more establishment publications their
[12:34.560 --> 12:40.120]  like we're gonna have the CIA kill the president and then fill mud things he
[12:40.120 --> 12:43.880]  can just go on CNN and say it well guess what the Secret Service is
[12:43.880 --> 12:49.480]  investigating that I can tell you that they are investigating mud they are
[12:49.480 --> 12:53.640]  investigating clapper Brennan all that went on the Aspen Institute three months
[12:53.640 --> 12:59.360]  ago and said he'll be gone by December extra judicially they said it won't be
[12:59.360 --> 13:03.680]  impeachment I know that's legislative but it's a judicial
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.560]  function of the legislative branch that's what impeachment is an indictment
[13:07.560 --> 13:11.960]  in the house a trial in the Senate and so the Secret Service just wanted me to
[13:11.960 --> 13:17.600]  know from Washington that this was two days ago that they are investigating
[13:17.600 --> 13:22.560]  these people and just said you have any more info and so I'm getting a bunch
[13:22.560 --> 13:27.880]  of information where they weren't even aware of some of the times Democrats and
[13:27.880 --> 13:37.280]  FBI operatives he wasn't just CIA also FBI mud who it appears his great great
[13:37.280 --> 13:40.320]  great great great grandfather was convicted of aiding John Willis Booth
[13:40.320 --> 13:44.680]  killing Lincoln that's why they say your name will be mud I'm not kidding you
[13:44.680 --> 13:49.720]  can't make this up they're investigating them all and I guess they just
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.200]  want them to know that too they just go ahead and tell people we are
[13:53.200 --> 13:59.280]  investigating so analysts see it on Trump the government's gonna kill this
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.520]  guy well mr. mud you had your big con game up there trying to act powerful and
[14:04.520 --> 14:07.840]  act tough to other rogue groups in the government to think man if they're
[14:07.840 --> 14:13.480]  talking about killing him on TV he must be weak you don't think people weren't
[14:13.480 --> 14:16.640]  aware of that and now it's come out that Eric Prince and all these other
[14:16.640 --> 14:20.160]  groups have had private security the entire time and I knew this didn't talk
[14:20.160 --> 14:23.640]  about it I know the other groups as well out of Florida that have been
[14:23.640 --> 14:27.320]  protecting Trump the entire time Trump's not stupid and they've got
[14:27.320 --> 14:34.200]  counter surveillance on you and now it's time for you to know that mr. mud and
[14:34.200 --> 14:40.240]  mr. Clinton and mr. Hillary and all the rest of you people and the morning Joe
[14:40.240 --> 14:45.120]  you don't think the president would just bring up that mysterious death of the
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.880]  intern getting a brains beat out in the middle of the night in your office if he
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.080]  wasn't intending to have some folks reopen that because there's no statute of
[14:53.080 --> 14:59.920]  limitations if it's deemed that and everybody's exhumed some are talking
[14:59.920 --> 15:05.800]  about that this was actually murdered so I'm just saying just saying you guys
[15:05.800 --> 15:12.360]  want to play this game you're about to get to play the game you want it you

[21:08.160 --> 21:12.800]  baron funded system that wanted to create a worldwide monopoly and end
[21:12.800 --> 21:18.320]  competition is being busted up right now globally just because the people have
[21:18.320 --> 21:23.480]  woken up and don't want it and there are now savvy individuals in government
[21:23.480 --> 21:28.280]  and in corporations and in the military that want prosperity and aren't complete
[21:28.280 --> 21:34.320]  psychopaths and are ready to ride this wave to power and I just say come on in
[21:34.320 --> 21:41.200]  come to power and let's go to the stars real simple what do we tell Hillary
[21:41.200 --> 21:45.480]  during the whole campaign we had a theme song for her a little bit vulgar but
[21:45.480 --> 21:49.400]  because it insults female dogs and I don't want to insult female dogs the
[21:49.400 --> 21:55.080]  term isn't strong enough but what it does how's a ludicrous song go move bitch
[21:55.080 --> 22:00.760]  get out the way you see them headlights you see them TVs who bought them TVs
[22:00.760 --> 22:07.520]  tell me that the point is is that get out the way get out the way get out the
[22:07.520 --> 22:15.080]  way move get out the way get out the way get out the way we don't want to fight
[22:15.080 --> 22:17.760]  with each other we don't want to be a bunch of idiots we don't want to fund
[22:17.760 --> 22:21.040]  radical Islamic groups to stir stuff up so we have an excuse to be in the
[22:21.040 --> 22:27.240]  Middle East the weird Machiavelli and geopolitical underhanded crap is bye bye
[22:27.240 --> 22:31.640]  that's not how we want to run civilization it doesn't work it works for
[22:31.640 --> 22:36.080]  scumbags that don't want prosperity and want to sit on top of third world
[22:36.080 --> 22:42.400]  banana republics we don't want that it doesn't mean if we shoot for being a
[22:42.400 --> 22:46.000]  pure society where we're gonna reach it but it's a lot better than trying to be
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.240]  evil so we're not selling a utopia we're simply selling the Americana
[22:52.240 --> 22:56.160]  Renaissance system the Enlightenment that we know is the best system by
[22:56.160 --> 23:02.200]  light years now that said coming up next segment I'm gonna get into the
[23:02.200 --> 23:09.120]  nightmare fires in California and some of that unbelievable footage and all the
[23:09.120 --> 23:15.240]  other plagues that have come upon the state also mainstream media is demonizing
[23:15.240 --> 23:20.080]  the president for keeping his promises and and just talking about how how
[23:20.080 --> 23:26.680]  terrible it is and how horrible it is Donald Trump keeper of promises is what
[23:26.680 --> 23:30.160]  CNN says and then they've got these graphs showing how he kept all his
[23:30.160 --> 23:34.200]  promises and is trying to keep the others and just how terrible this is
[23:34.200 --> 23:37.520]  we're gonna get into that and then we're also gonna get into Hamas leader calls
[23:37.520 --> 23:42.480]  for new intifada in the face of Israel all Trump did was keep his promise
[23:42.480 --> 23:46.640]  follow the law three other presidents were scared to do it and just say we're
[23:46.640 --> 23:50.040]  calling your bluff if you claim to attack us we have an embassy in a city
[23:50.040 --> 23:56.040]  where everybody else has their embassies then go ahead we're not gonna give in to
[23:56.040 --> 23:59.280]  the threat of terrorism is what that statement is we've got Al Franken who's
[23:59.280 --> 24:03.600]  announced he's resigning John Conyers all of that Russian military mission
[24:03.600 --> 24:09.840]  accomplished Islamic State defeated in Syria we have excerpts of the incoming
[24:09.840 --> 24:14.520]  FBI director defending the agency amid Trump criticism and the implosion of
[24:14.520 --> 24:18.240]  confidence in the agency after they were caught being completely political
[24:18.240 --> 24:21.560]  they didn't just get caught Mueller covered up everything for the Clintons
[24:21.560 --> 24:28.280]  so did coming does that fake Christian Lordy Lordy thing I just am a good man
[24:28.280 --> 24:34.000]  of the Lord I never even seen a woman with her clothes off I I just go to
[24:34.000 --> 24:40.440]  church nine days a week Lordy Lordy yeah right call me behind the scenes is
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.120]  anyways Lordy Lordy I think would be the word for that let's just say as phony
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.240]  as a three-dollar bill but their attempt to get rid of Trump is baloney and it's
[24:50.240 --> 24:56.000]  about a million years late the trillion dollar short so that's coming up as well
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  meanwhile the encryption cryptocurrency market is now worth more than JP Morgan
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.200]  which is worth 300 plus billion dollars so now I'm wishing I invested in
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.520]  Bitcoin but I couldn't understand it and I and I and people said it's fiat like
[25:11.520 --> 25:14.720]  the government's money I go well I know their money's fraudulent too but I
[25:14.720 --> 25:20.040]  guess it's just been allowed to operate and be the new dominant system 370
[25:20.040 --> 25:26.040]  billion smackers and of course bitcoins a part of that but wow that's coming up
[25:26.040 --> 25:33.960]  as well today so much to get to we've got senator Grassley just destroyed them in
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.880]  a 35 minute speech he gave on the floor of the Senate yesterday we're gonna play
[25:39.880 --> 25:46.560]  some powerful excerpts of that first but before I go any further I have something
[25:46.560 --> 25:51.640]  I want to announce here today and I think everybody should listen to me very
[25:51.640 --> 25:55.640]  very carefully because we spent a lot of time and energy on this I know folks
[25:55.640 --> 26:00.880]  love supermail vitality and it's wonderful I know folks love Anthroplex
[26:00.880 --> 26:05.880]  it's excellent but I set out to bring you a top-of-the-line formula with one
[26:05.880 --> 26:12.120]  of the top developers in the country that is so strong and so powerful that a
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.040]  lot of you probably won't even want to take it you'll probably want to take the
[26:15.040 --> 26:23.680]  Anthroplex or the alpha the supermail vitality because this new product alpha
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.800]  power actually has all the major clinical studies were even able to make
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.520]  major claims on it we went out and got the certified approved most expensive
[26:33.520 --> 26:38.600]  ingredients but sold to you at a price that leading competitors sell that is
[26:38.600 --> 26:45.240]  50 times weaker you heard me right 50 times this we can say this is the
[26:45.240 --> 26:52.920]  strongest formula with these known hit compounds that anybody's got and they're
[26:52.920 --> 26:56.880]  seeing is safe now that said ladies and gentlemen you better be careful with this
[26:56.880 --> 27:03.800]  alpha power now it's targeted at males but it works great on women as well the
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.680]  secret ingredient behind the all-new alpha power is the main ingredient lj 100
[27:08.680 --> 27:12.200]  now folks that know what that is know about it but if you don't you need to
[27:12.200 --> 27:15.960]  find out about it it is the most potent highest quality and most studied extract
[27:15.960 --> 27:20.920]  in its category on the market this ingredient is extracted to the most
[27:20.920 --> 27:25.040]  potent form available while maintaining the bioactive portion of the plant in
[27:25.040 --> 27:30.800]  the secret proprietary extraction process that ensures it's not been
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.760]  deteriorated or had any of its properties taken it's not been denatured let
[27:35.760 --> 27:41.040]  me just explain this to you not only is it many times stronger than any other
[27:41.040 --> 27:44.400]  leading competitor that has just the so-called herbs the way it's concentrated
[27:44.400 --> 27:50.840]  ladies and gentlemen is just completely insane and it is it is just
[27:50.840 --> 27:55.560]  incredibly powerful that's why you could say it's 50 times stronger than what
[27:55.560 --> 28:00.360]  other brands have with the so-called plant extract because lj 100 is
[28:00.360 --> 28:07.200]  patented proven documented studied to just be the ultimate and we've got a
[28:07.200 --> 28:12.040]  huge amount of it ladies and gentlemen in each capsule what we can say what I'm
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.280]  allowed to say this is from the lawyers boost sports performance increases
[28:16.280 --> 28:21.240]  physical and mental energy helps maintain normal high free testosterone levels
[28:21.240 --> 28:27.000]  in men which most men are low boosts healthy alpha pheromones yes there are
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.440]  real alpha pheromones improved sleep quality but the more energy during the

[33:44.400 --> 33:50.840]  who is bipartisanly respected as being really fair and even-handed destroying
[33:50.840 --> 33:55.600]  the partisanship of the FBI and the two-sidedness and the two different
[33:55.600 --> 34:00.560]  standards and the emptiness of the Russiagate witch hunt that's because
[34:00.560 --> 34:04.200]  Hillary was going for broke she'd committed all these crimes she had to
[34:04.200 --> 34:08.200]  get into the White House and when she didn't they had to turn it around and
[34:08.200 --> 34:13.360]  blame Trump for what they'd done and by the mainstream media and by the other
[34:13.360 --> 34:17.760]  Democrats signing on to this and some Republicans they have all irrevocably
[34:17.760 --> 34:24.560]  tied themselves to a big old box of rocks and chain their legs to it and
[34:24.560 --> 34:30.240]  thrown themselves into the abyss that's what they've done here and it just shows
[34:30.240 --> 34:35.440]  how they believe because they're in charge of this big powerful country that
[34:35.440 --> 34:41.680]  they are invincible and they're not so that's coming up we have several guests
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.720]  joining us I'll also open the phones up today but before I go any further here

[34:51.720 --> 34:57.440]  should be praying for the folks there in California because it's a hellhole
[34:57.440 --> 35:03.080]  situation you've got the super high taxes the regulations the TV outbreaks
[35:03.080 --> 35:07.840]  homeless people seems like defecating all over the place it looks like scenes
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.560]  out of hell from satellites and there's footage of people driving around most of
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.720]  you've seen it and you just see huge fires spanning in some cases all around
[35:17.720 --> 35:22.240]  them people wake up in the morning and the fires were five miles away and now
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.640]  the fires are just in their backyard and the police and the firefighters are
[35:26.640 --> 35:33.200]  getting totally exhausted they don't know what to do and it just really seems
[35:33.200 --> 35:39.200]  biblical I mean I'm not saying God's judging California I'm just saying it
[35:39.200 --> 35:42.520]  looks like something out of out of Armageddon but oh there's a bunch of
[35:42.520 --> 35:47.000]  Democrats in Hollywood people blaming Trump they say this is an omen that you
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.760]  know it's because of Trump this is happening so Ventura fires rage
[35:50.760 --> 35:56.200]  threatens communities both coastal and inland LA times huge flames ripping down
[35:56.200 --> 36:02.380]  the mountain the Thomas fire roars back to life homes threatened in
[36:02.380 --> 36:08.280]  Santa Paula that's all because of those winds coming from the east coming out
[36:08.280 --> 36:12.280]  over the west and out to the sea one of the images you really ought to see is
[36:12.280 --> 36:16.160]  the satellite images of the fires in California from NASA it's incredible
[36:16.160 --> 36:21.920]  southern Cal fires scorch an area the size of Atlanta and they're only getting
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.920]  tired more and more exhausted LA FD fire department chief our people are
[36:28.920 --> 36:33.600]  getting tired I bet they are this is just it's ongoing hurricane force Gus could
[36:33.600 --> 36:39.920]  cripple battle versus Southern California and the wild fires you really
[36:39.920 --> 36:44.160]  got a feel for those folks rich residents flee burning bell-air mansions in
[36:44.160 --> 36:51.600]  fifth Cali wildfire and it just shows how the rich are not exempt from any of
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.280]  this but historically people think as long as something is just down the
[36:55.280 --> 37:01.320]  street it's not really going to affect them well as we can see now ladies and
[37:01.320 --> 37:05.920]  gentlemen just because the fires over your hill doesn't mean tomorrow it won't
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.680]  be burning down your house and that's an effective metaphor for just life in
[37:11.680 --> 37:17.080]  general and the fires of communism the fires of authoritarianism the fires of
[37:17.080 --> 37:21.640]  the globalist imploding third-world countries
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.080]  they are being directed by the globalists in their own admissions they
[37:29.080 --> 37:32.920]  use these crises to try to gain even more power and in many cases let the
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.200]  crises get completely out of control even if we have good management and are
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.280]  moral and upright and try to not destroy ourselves in the planet even if we do our
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.440]  best job it's going to take praying and seeking God's discernment for humanity
[37:47.440 --> 37:52.120]  to make it to a type one civilization that's a civilization that can live
[37:52.120 --> 37:56.680]  outside of its own planet that's a civilization that makes it out of the
[37:56.680 --> 38:02.920]  nursery that's a civilization that makes it from being a tadpole into a frog or
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.760]  from being a caterpillar into a butterfly and I can tell you right now the
[38:08.760 --> 38:12.560]  globalists have decided to just mismanage stuff it's too hard just use
[38:12.560 --> 38:16.200]  crises to get more control because they think humanity is already over they're
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.280]  going to merge the machines they're going to supposedly you know just become
[38:20.280 --> 38:25.600]  these AI gods and so the earth they just think that they're going to transcend it
[38:25.600 --> 38:33.360]  by destroying it that's the evil cosmology the evil world view the evil
[38:33.360 --> 38:39.800]  ethos of what are the transhumanist who come out of the whole eugenics movement
[38:39.800 --> 38:43.920]  I'm not saying your average garden variety
[38:43.920 --> 38:49.360]  outer court porch transhumanist is a bad person I just want to live longer and
[38:49.360 --> 38:52.600]  be cyborgs or whatever and then of course there's a lot of innovations there
[38:52.600 --> 38:56.400]  and a lot of people may choose to do that the point is the globalist in the
[38:56.400 --> 39:01.760]  inner sanctum of transhumanism are worshiping an AI God that demands all
[39:01.760 --> 39:08.680]  of us first die before the select enlightened are given immortality I've
[39:08.680 --> 39:11.880]  been telling you that for 20 years since I learned about it made a film 10 years
[39:11.880 --> 39:15.360]  ago about it Elon Musk started warning you about a year ago he said I go to
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.560]  these meetings and they say humanity's over we're getting rid of them we're
[39:19.560 --> 39:24.680]  gonna merge with AI gods we're building God Elon Musk goes listen I go to these
[39:24.680 --> 39:28.280]  private off-the-record meetings and the majority of the billionaires plan to
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.880]  kill everybody he goes watch out people that talk about AI gods they're
[39:32.880 --> 39:38.640]  anti-human exterminists and now it's all over the news everything I told you
[39:38.640 --> 39:43.040]  what do you think I just made this stuff up and then somebody else picked it up
[39:43.040 --> 39:49.080]  that's why all the mainstream media edits what I say takes it out of context to
[39:49.080 --> 39:55.040]  try to psychologically inoculate people so that when they first run into me live
[39:55.040 --> 39:59.160]  or what I'm actually writing or saying they just tune out and ignore it thinking
[39:59.160 --> 40:03.960]  oh this guy you know this guy made this stuff up this guy's full of baloney this
[40:03.960 --> 40:10.000]  guy can't be trusted just again hoping you don't pay attention because folks it
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.920]  was in government documents 20 years ago that cable boxes had hidden cameras and
[40:13.920 --> 40:18.920]  microphones in them and I broke one open on television and they literally sent
[40:18.920 --> 40:23.200]  private paramilitary after me to attack me physically in a parking lot and tell
[40:23.200 --> 40:27.400]  me to shut up I mean that's the type of stuff that's going on ladies and gentlemen
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.440]  with the because back then if people would have found out then there'd have
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.360]  been a big scare a big freak out but instead they roll it out slow they
[40:35.360 --> 40:43.160]  water it down they slowly introduce it until okay yeah Samsung watches me Sony
[40:43.160 --> 40:50.520]  watches me okay my cable box watches me okay my smartphone watches me okay Airbnb
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.720]  watch it watches me okay okay there are animal human chimeras and Brad be
[40:55.720 --> 40:59.800]  talking about that 20 years ago oh you're crazy now it's in the news oh mice
[40:59.800 --> 41:05.360]  with human brains oh humanoids grown in cows for their organs to be harvested
[41:05.360 --> 41:10.120]  and they sign waiver forms and stuff it's been approved and people are already
[41:10.120 --> 41:13.320]  getting these levers already getting these kidneys they're just keeping an
[41:13.320 --> 41:20.920]  old DL down low now you see they're gonna come out with it all
[41:20.920 --> 41:25.640]  national geographic and everywhere else they're going oh we just now started
[41:25.640 --> 41:31.040]  doing it no it was in in it it was an industry and DARPA literature that was
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.200]  public 22 years ago is the first time I saw it and they were reporting on 10 and
[41:36.200 --> 41:43.560]  15 year old projects in 1995 they were reporting on 10 and 15 year old projects
[41:43.560 --> 41:47.200]  they were probably going on before that so I'm done talking about that for now
[41:47.200 --> 41:53.400]  when we come back it's incredible I've got the graphics from CNN themselves but
[41:53.400 --> 41:56.400]  from their perspective they think they're attacking the president from our
[41:56.400 --> 42:02.440]  perspective it's incredible where they show graphs of how he's horrible because
[42:02.440 --> 42:06.160]  he's delivering on his promises and fighting to deliver on the other
[42:06.160 --> 42:10.480]  promises and how it's the work and how he's naive and how he's bad and how he's
[42:10.480 --> 42:17.320]  stupid wait till that comes up and then senator Grassley I mean it's a 35 minute
[42:17.320 --> 42:20.360]  speech that we should play all of it but we've got it boiled down to like 15
[42:20.360 --> 42:24.080]  minutes I'm gonna air that the first part of the hour that Matt Bracken former
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.000]  Navy SEAL counterterrorism expert joins us about the whole Israel situation what

[42:32.200 --> 42:40.920]  and then we have the Breitbart Israel editor joining us to get into that
[42:40.920 --> 42:45.360]  perspective on the whole situation and so much more and then meanwhile Obama
[42:45.360 --> 42:51.160]  bought deportation of 550,000 legals more than Atlanta's entire population

[47:47.600 --> 47:51.600]  planet is turning against the globalist not just here in the US but all over the
[47:51.600 --> 47:57.880]  world and the Democratic Party is officially now a coastal elites party
[47:57.880 --> 48:02.880]  it is in freefall collapse there is a total political realignment the
[48:02.880 --> 48:06.840]  republican establishment is in freefall collapse they're being removed the
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.520]  secret service is investigating democratic party and deep state leaders
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.440]  that have been calling for Trump's death and who have been saying he'll soon be
[48:15.440 --> 48:22.960]  out of office incredible things are now happening we feel like we've been the
[48:22.960 --> 48:27.440]  underdog and and outside the power structure so long that we just think
[48:27.440 --> 48:31.840]  that the globalists are invincible they're not we're gonna take the country
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.520]  and the world back and then it's up to us to be moral and strong and
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.800]  upstanding and to not create a utopia that's impossible look out anybody tells
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.800]  you they can but to get back to the closest thing we can to it which is a
[48:45.800 --> 48:52.160]  rugged individualism based system so incredible things are happening it's an
[48:52.160 --> 49:00.240]  incredible time to be alive right now that said the culture of the mainstream
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.960]  media and the culture and the nastiness the globalist have created in the
[49:04.960 --> 49:11.120]  racism and enmity they've created our aftershocks and problems we're going
[49:11.120 --> 49:15.280]  to have to deal with for a long time we're defeating this current crop of
[49:15.280 --> 49:22.920]  arrogant kleptocrats but we've still got serious issues to deal with and you're
[49:22.920 --> 49:26.640]  still gonna have a lot of these people trained in deception and trained in
[49:26.640 --> 49:32.160]  upside-down world inversion wandering around society so there's gonna be
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.320]  serious blowback from this most of them are getting fired or laid off right now
[49:36.320 --> 49:40.560]  because they couldn't deliver for the establishment so that's why you see
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.720]  massive layoffs massive exodus 50% line laid off at Time Warner layoffs being
[49:46.720 --> 49:50.240]  announced every day because they're they're frauds they're piles of garbage
[49:50.240 --> 49:55.920]  but you're gonna have the zombie hordes now kind of wandering the land setting
[49:55.920 --> 50:02.920]  up their own scallywag and carpet bag operations in your area I don't mean
[50:02.920 --> 50:07.120]  northerners coming to the south I mean just like people come to any devastated
[50:07.120 --> 50:11.360]  area to take advantage of folks we're gonna see that in the modern modern
[50:11.360 --> 50:15.680]  sense just like the refugees from California bring their failed ways to
[50:15.680 --> 50:20.120]  your area and then try to collapse it not knowing why everything they touch is
[50:20.120 --> 50:26.960]  turns to garbage but here's the big story it's all over ABC News NBC News CBS
[50:26.960 --> 50:31.120]  News they've gone from saying Trump's a liar Trump's evil Trump's a fraud that
[50:31.120 --> 50:35.320]  hasn't worked to okay Trump is telling the truth because they know his
[50:35.320 --> 50:38.640]  constituents and his supporters know he's telling the truth but that's a bad
[50:38.640 --> 50:44.280]  idea and he's a Rube and he's a hayseed and he's a buffoon and the experts know
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.360]  he's wrong same experts said he couldn't win same experts said we couldn't have
[50:48.360 --> 50:53.440]  3% growth rate same experts say couldn't control the border and so they give a
[50:53.440 --> 50:58.520]  report card there's two different articles Donald Trump keeper of promises
[50:58.520 --> 51:03.840]  and there's a big article making fun of him and now he's obsessed with delivering
[51:03.840 --> 51:10.040]  then they got another article that is a graph breakdown tracking Trump's
[51:10.040 --> 51:16.680]  promises and then they go through it with a rundown where it stands and this
[51:16.680 --> 51:21.920]  is a rare moment we're seeing in is actually somewhat honest until the end
[51:21.920 --> 51:27.680]  Trump's travel ban 3.0 is now snaking its way to the Supreme Court which said
[51:27.680 --> 51:31.800]  on October 24th it wouldn't hear arguments about the second one which has
[51:31.800 --> 51:34.880]  now expired well they've actually approved it about a week earlier a
[51:34.880 --> 51:40.360]  federal judge in Maryland blocked the third ban finding that it wasn't tainted
[51:40.360 --> 51:43.560]  by religious discrimination another federal judge in a wide of the same
[51:43.560 --> 51:48.040]  thing saying it plainly discriminates based on nationality more details here
[51:48.040 --> 51:52.040]  so they throw a racism thing up front that has nothing to do with it when it's
[51:52.040 --> 51:56.200]  about sovereignty and basic vetting and not having the UN vet who comes into the
[51:56.200 --> 51:59.560]  country that's who's been in charge Trump's got pulled out of that and they
[51:59.560 --> 52:03.920]  finally get into what he's actually done number one Trump signs an executive order
[52:03.920 --> 52:08.180]  suspends for 90 days the entry of persons from seven heavily Muslim
[52:08.180 --> 52:15.120]  nations Syria Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Yemen and this order and it goes
[52:15.120 --> 52:21.160]  on to say he delivered on that front then it continues and you know where it
[52:21.160 --> 52:24.000]  currently stands at this level but the best way to do this is just to put the
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.800]  graph back on television for me please and because this this printed off
[52:28.800 --> 52:31.520]  differently than I actually read the whole thing this morning so there it is
[52:31.520 --> 52:36.880]  he's about 30% there on repealing and replacing Obamacare I'd say with these
[52:36.880 --> 52:40.480]  latest tax votes he's about 70% there but at least they admit he's trying to do
[52:40.480 --> 52:47.360]  it halt Muslim entry to the US they say he's 80% there that's unvetted Muslim so
[52:47.360 --> 52:50.720]  again the lies are in the headlines but still they're admitting he did what he
[52:50.720 --> 52:55.880]  said he do halt Muslim entry in the US no he's halting unvetted people from
[52:55.880 --> 53:00.080]  countries that don't even have real passports move the US embassy to Israel
[53:00.080 --> 53:03.800]  from Jerusalem they say he's halfway there withdraw from Paris climate
[53:03.800 --> 53:08.200]  agreement 100% that's the global carbon tax that Al Gore makes money off of and
[53:08.200 --> 53:12.440]  that India and China and everybody else are exempt from block Syrian refugees
[53:12.440 --> 53:17.120]  they say he's 70% there reverse environmental restrictions you mean
[53:17.120 --> 53:21.360]  red tape meant to shut us down they say he's about 60% there improve Russian
[53:21.360 --> 53:25.280]  relations he's 10% there but they're not letting him go the rest of the way
[53:25.280 --> 53:31.000]  build a US Mexico border wall they say he's 20% there I'd say it's more like
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.400]  40% because they're already building the demos and started that's half the battle
[53:34.400 --> 53:38.080]  deport millions of undocumented immigrants he's already deported about
[53:38.080 --> 53:45.200]  35% green light pipelines like DAPL and Keystone he's 90% there withdraw from the
[53:45.200 --> 53:51.400]  TPP global total takeover 100% there renegotiate from the withdrawal of
[53:51.400 --> 53:56.200]  naphthin gas 70% there that's accurate I can't believe CNN actually told the
[53:56.200 --> 54:01.400]  truth partly that was amazed this morning lower taxes for individuals and
[54:01.400 --> 54:07.160]  corporations he's about 15% there and with this week's tax vote I'd say he's
[54:07.160 --> 54:14.440]  40% there reintegrate and renegotiate the Iran deal 20% there bring back
[54:14.440 --> 54:19.800]  torture 0% there that's something I don't really agree with and he's he he
[54:19.800 --> 54:23.360]  backed off that he's just being open when he thought just it's already going on
[54:23.360 --> 54:27.440]  and he was just being honest and I'm even agree with it but that's then I
[54:27.440 --> 54:30.360]  agree he's being honest so there you go that's that's actually not true they're
[54:30.360 --> 54:35.120]  torturing torturing people okay believe me they're torturing a lot of folks that
[54:35.120 --> 54:38.280]  are ISIS or Al Qaeda and I think it's dangerous to turn into what we're
[54:38.280 --> 54:41.760]  fighting with there you go it's certainly been working so far though get rid
[54:41.760 --> 54:45.920]  of common core hasn't got that done yet but trying defeat ISIS they say he's
[54:45.920 --> 54:52.400]  95% there 90% there create a Muslim registry that's how they spotted it's
[54:52.400 --> 54:55.560]  not a Muslim registry it's an extremist registry of people saying they
[54:55.560 --> 54:59.840]  want to kill folks okay so that's that's just a fake point at the end build a
[54:59.840 --> 55:04.640]  Guantanamo Bay that's not what he said rebuild America's infrastructure they
[55:04.640 --> 55:09.680]  say zero no he's already got about 15% of that going they're just trying to tell
[55:09.680 --> 55:13.800]  you like Lloyd Blankfine said it'll never happen and then the final big lie
[55:13.800 --> 55:17.320]  they lie about him rebuilding America's infrastructure he's gotten that going and
[55:17.320 --> 55:20.760]  they lie about him bringing back jobs from overseas thousands of companies
[55:20.760 --> 55:24.320]  have announced they're coming back hundreds have come back and he stopped
[55:24.320 --> 55:29.240]  hundreds from leaving so at the end they lie about some of his biggest
[55:29.240 --> 55:32.240]  accomplishments how about the stock market he said he wanted to get the stock
[55:32.240 --> 55:36.280]  market up up at record levels how about getting consumer confidence back record
[55:36.280 --> 55:41.560]  levels how about getting small business startups back record levels so they
[55:41.560 --> 55:46.320]  don't really show everything he's done by a long mile crushing political
[55:46.320 --> 55:51.480]  correctness getting more visits for our VA folks it's up massively something like
[55:51.480 --> 55:54.480]  the most double the amount of appointments they're getting and they're
[55:54.480 --> 55:58.480]  now privatizing and out and stuff I mean so he's delivering there and I'm not
[55:58.480 --> 56:03.960]  worshiping Trump I'm I'm worshiping the truth you shall know the truth it shall
[56:03.960 --> 56:09.760]  set you free the power of truth and it's just the truth and I'm surprised that
[56:09.760 --> 56:13.360]  they're having to admit some of the truth but in the article they spent it
[56:13.360 --> 56:17.840]  like he's a buffoon everybody knows you're supposed to lie everybody knows
[56:17.840 --> 56:20.600]  you're not supposed to tell your constituents the truth everybody knows
[56:20.600 --> 56:25.120]  and you know all the experts say he's an idiot and blah blah blah know you're
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.920]  the idiots that hijacked the country and then now think it belongs to you when

[1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:53.440]  seeing and admits Trump has kept most of his promises news network shot that
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:57.240]  president would risk angering elite by actually following through on his word
[1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:01.120]  and they admit the other promises he hasn't kept he's trying to get them
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:05.320]  kept well that's because there's a businessman and a billionaire a self-made
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:09.600]  man he spent millions of dollars on op-ed articles against after and get and
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:13.240]  exposing globalism his dad was an anti-communist that gave my of the
[1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:17.480]  John Birch society and was a patriot and so he's sick of everything you're sick
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:21.760]  of and he's really real doesn't mean he's perfect but he's really real and
[1:01:21.760 --> 1:01:25.960]  that's why they're freaked out and you see the prosperity come roaring back
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:31.920]  ladies and gentlemen because God forbid that the president actually keep his
[1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:35.560]  promises and you go through the graph of all the things they show the promises
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:40.920]  he's kept this is an important article this article on info wars calm by Paul
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:46.560]  Joseph Watson needs to go mega viral ladies and gentlemen now there is so
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:50.520]  much breaking news unfolding right now but let's get back on how they're
[1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:56.680]  attacking the president Al Franken just a 30 minutes ago resigned on the Senate
[1:01:56.680 --> 1:02:02.960]  floor announced he has plans to resign is it might be like Brian Williams who
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:07.320]  said he was leaving NBC News but after folks forgot what a big liar he is and
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:12.160]  how he wasn't shot down on a helicopter and all other fake reports he then came
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:18.600]  back as I predicted but the fall of Al Franken champion of women slams Trump
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:24.120]  more on the way out here's the issue we didn't have these allegations about
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:28.520]  Trump until he ran for president these have been known about you forever and
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:32.200]  there's photos and there's videos and there's now more than 20 women with
[1:02:32.200 --> 1:02:35.400]  Trump a lot of the lawsuits turned out to be Jane Doe's they weren't real
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:41.480]  people and it was totally fake and people understand that you're also part of
[1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:46.440]  the globalist establishment they want out so it's your party that makes your
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:51.120]  allegations the reason people have to go not Trump he didn't go for the
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:57.000]  allegations most of which turned out to be false okay he didn't leave you guys
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.360]  create this stampede because this is your political weapon and now it's blown
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:08.720]  up in your own face but it's bigger than that it's been mainly Democrats it's
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:13.320]  been reported upwards of 90% they're saying that have been paid out to
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:19.840]  victims in the harassment and in the assaults inside Congress so again you're
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:24.080]  the ones with John Conyers and creepy Joe Biden I mean we got photos of him at
[1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:28.800]  Christmas parties grabbing women by their breast I saw some more videos just
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:33.840]  yesterday I meant to give him the crew I forgot that Pat Riley has them because I
[1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:36.560]  was looking at him on his phone I'm like what I was looking at his photos on his
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:40.680]  Facebook I was like well I never saw this and I I hit video and it's him at a
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:45.520]  Christmas party last year grabs the woman's breasts full grown woman just I
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.960]  mean next to the guy's wife so you're the guys that are out of control sure
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:55.080]  there's some Republican perverts as well but that's what's happening here so
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:59.920]  here he is blaming Trump and others on his way out for being a sack of unfunny
[1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:08.760]  unscrupulous Harvey Weinstein garbage here he is I have all people and aware
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:16.280]  that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who is
[1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:22.680]  bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:29.480]  and a man who has repeatedly prayed on young girls campaigns for the Senate
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:34.560]  with the with the full support of his party that's enough I'm gonna play more
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:37.960]  coming up we're gonna break here but did you catch how they wrote that to make it
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:42.480]  sound like he brags about assaulting women in the Oval Office he wasn't the
[1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:46.080]  Oval Office when this supposedly happened he wasn't bragging about it it's all
[1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:49.920]  edited tape he's saying women throw themselves on you you can do anything you
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:57.320]  want like Elvis with women climbing on top yeah our fire is on the top

[1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:54.720]  failed comedian Al Franken that demonic goblin creature has now announced he's
[1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:59.280]  going to be leaving the Senate and they'll have some new little shark tooth
[1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:05.840]  gremlin climb out a Mordor and I guess try to continue their strangulation of
[1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:10.000]  the country and you've got John Conyers leaving all these others having to leave
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:16.160]  and all these rhino neocon republicans what is it like four of them in the Senate 15 of them are
[1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:19.920]  so in the house they're leaving because their constituents are awake now and
[1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:27.920]  they're saying we want you gone but the big news the big news is that they went
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:31.760]  a bridge too far trying to steal the election steal the nomination from
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:35.680]  Sanders trying to stop Trump from being seated as president trying to block
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:39.120]  people going to the inauguration beating up families the fake Russia
[1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:43.440]  investigation just drew attention to uranium one and the cover-ups the
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:48.400]  foundation and the servers and then the missing kids and the kidnapped Haitians
[1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:54.240]  and the stolen Haitian money and on and on and on and now they're looking at
[1:07:54.240 --> 1:08:00.000]  Mueller and they're looking at Comey and their arrogance waddling around trying
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.760]  to frustrate the American voters and trying to stop the economic recovery
[1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:10.000]  and trying to destroy the FBI and suddenly democratic pundits even on msnbc and
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:13.920]  cnn are hedging their bets going well this does look bad this partisanship
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:18.880]  not just of this one senior russia expert FBI guy that we now know got the info
[1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:24.000]  from the made up 13 million dollar ppgate dossier
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:30.320]  but now now we're learning more of these people
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:34.560]  are in emails and text messages and that the congress has
[1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:39.760]  damning bombshell info that they're just waiting to see if Comey and Mueller do
[1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:44.160]  the right thing and back off and they're not going to
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:47.120]  they're never going to give up just like Monty Python
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:51.200]  for the night's attacking the guy and he cuts his arms off his legs off and he
[1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:53.440]  won't stop he goes look i've cut your arms and legs off he
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:58.640]  goes it's a mere flesh wound powered and keeps attacking
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:02.320]  they don't know when to give up and they're never
[1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:07.360]  going to give up until we politically put them down
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:09.520]  they're saying on tv they're gonna kill the president
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:12.560]  hashtag hunt republicans they've got former deputy fbi directors that
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:15.840]  Mueller brought in saying they're gonna kill the president
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:19.760]  the secret service is investigating it they're crazy they have to act confident
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:22.160]  they have to act like now come on everybody let's go kill
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:25.840]  trump let's say the russia come on i'm saying on tv we're strong
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:31.760]  no you're not your goddess your leader is a demonic crone that can hardly walk
[1:09:31.760 --> 1:09:35.200]  your delusional filth just because you sat on top of the country when it was
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:40.080]  asleep forever sucking it dry doesn't mean it goes on forever
[1:09:40.080 --> 1:09:42.400]  now there's a bunch of these and i'm gonna i'm not to play more of these in
[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:45.600]  the next hour it's in the full speeches up on info wars dot com
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:49.360]  grassley slams bipartisan oversight of fbi
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:53.200]  investigation grassley outlines political bias
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:56.720]  grassley addresses shortcomings of vetting fusion gps dossier
[1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:01.200]  grassley details problems concerning clinton email investigation
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:06.960]  which ones we play first matt grassley outlines political bias of fbi
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:11.520]  yeah let's do grassley slams bipartisan oversight of fbi investigation
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:17.040]  now this is uh again on info wars dot com from last night here it is
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:22.800]  i have been doing oversight of the executive branch for a very long time
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:28.160]  i've done it as ranking member i've done it as chairman
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:31.600]  i've done it when my party held the white house
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:35.920]  and i've done it when the other party held the white house
[1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:41.280]  earlier this year i stood up for the rights of my democrat colleagues
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:44.400]  to do oversight of the trump administration
[1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:50.560]  even while they are in the minority i did it because it was the right thing to
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:55.280]  do lots of people give lip service to the notion
[1:10:55.280 --> 1:11:01.520]  of bipartisan oversight but very few actually practice it
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:07.040]  it's tough you have to be willing to work with colleagues in the other party
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:11.280]  to ask tough questions of your own political allies
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:18.400]  and you can't just ask if you actually want answers you have to follow through
[1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:24.320]  true bipartisan oversight is impossible unless it's a two-way street
[1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:28.400]  if democrats are unwilling to ask hard questions and force answers
[1:11:28.400 --> 1:11:31.840]  from their own political allies then there simply
[1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:36.160]  is no way to move forward together in good faith
[1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:41.040]  both sides need to be committed to getting the whole story
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:45.120]  not just the half that they think helps their side
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:49.360]  regardless of whether my democrat colleagues join me or not
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:11:55.600]  i'm interested in that whole story there are two major controversies
[1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:58.720]  plaguing the credibility of the justice department
[1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:05.600]  and the fbi right now on the one hand the trump russia investigation
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.480]  and then the on the other hand the handling of the clinton investigation
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:14.880]  any congressional oversight related to either one of these topics
[1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:20.080]  is not credible without also examining the other
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:25.680]  both cases were active during last year's campaign
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:29.520]  both cases have been linked to the firing
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:34.480]  of the fbi director i have been trying to explain this to my democratic
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.440]  colleagues for months the political reality is that half
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:43.360]  of the country thinks that our law enforcement establishment
[1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:47.520]  gave hillary clinton and her aides a pass
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:51.600]  these questions go to the heart of the integrity
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.320]  of our federal law enforcement and justice system
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:59.280]  they're not going to go away just because clinton
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:05.040]  lost the election the independent inspector general at the justice department
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:11.520]  certainly isn't ignoring that issue democrats and republicans in congress
[1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:15.920]  have asked the inspector general to look into a host of issues
[1:13:15.920 --> 1:13:19.600]  involving the handling of the clinton investigation
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:25.600]  during the campaign his hard work has already uncovered some pretty
[1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:31.200]  disturbing information over the past week the press has reported
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:36.240]  that an fbi agent was removed from the special counsel's team
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:41.040]  and demoted at the fbi due to what do you think
[1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:46.160]  political bias the agent was at the very center
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:52.000]  of both of these high-profile investigations
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:59.040]  high-ranking fbi agent peter struck reportedly used his work phone
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:03.760]  to send anti-trump and pro-clinton text messages
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:06.960]  to another fbi agent with whom he was having
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:13.520]  an illicit and immoral relationship this man
[1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.440]  was the deputy assistant director for the fbi's
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.240]  counterintelligence division he worked on the investigation
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:25.200]  of former secretary of state hitory clinton's
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:30.240]  use of a private server to conduct what do you think
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:34.240]  official business according to news reports
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:39.360]  and according to documents it looks like he also helped draft
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:42.800]  combi's controversial public statement
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:47.840]  ending that case of hillary clinton and the emails
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:52.320]  specifically he apparently edited out language that suggested
[1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:59.360]  legal jeopardy for clinton press reports state that he opened the fbi's
[1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:05.840]  investigation of allegations of collusion between the trump campaign
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:12.560]  and the and russia and it's been reported that he was one of the
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:16.960]  two fbi agents who interviewed former national
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:24.560]  security advisor michael flinn can you imagine if the shoe
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:31.120]  were on the other foot what if a high-ranking fbi official
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:35.440]  got caught expressing pro trump political bias
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:42.000]  on his work on his work phone while leading what is supposed to be a
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:47.440]  professional objective and non-partisan search
[1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:50.400]  for the truth well i say the facade would fall

[1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:03.920]  in a move that some say will shake the middle east to the core
[1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:07.200]  israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with trump's announcement
[1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:11.280]  the turkish president warned trump that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of
[1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:14.560]  israel was a red line the Saudis are calling this a flagrant
[1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:17.600]  provocation of muslims and Palestinian leaders have already
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:21.280]  planned for protests terror group Hamas is calling for a day of
[1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:24.560]  rage friday urging Palestinians in an official

[1:19:28.880 --> 1:19:32.800]  after the upcoming friday prayers ahead of president trump's announcement the
[1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:36.400]  u.s military deployed additional forces throughout the middle east
[1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:40.640]  in anticipation of widespread political unrest and even terror attacks
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:44.400]  although some u.s officials had urged trump not to make this sort of a move
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:47.760]  u.s policy should never be dictated by threats of violence
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:51.520]  with the opposition against trump's historic decision building the days
[1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:57.760]  ahead could turn out to be tumultuous lienne macadoo info wars.com
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:20:07.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:34.960]  play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:39.360]  hitler took the guns stalling took the guns mal took the guns that el castro

[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:06.080]  tyranny over the mind of man
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:17.520]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:22.000]  by the way you can go back to ads i did 15 years ago where i do thumbs up for
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.160]  ballcaps and shirts and done like you know the a okay symbol
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:30.320]  when i grew up people i guess trump kind of was the 70s guy or something
[1:21:30.320 --> 1:21:33.360]  back when i was a kid the 70s thumbs up and everything's great
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:38.000]  like race car drivers or evil keneval you know after you made a jump he
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.360]  you know thumbs up and then like if something was a okay or like
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:44.320]  if grandma made some really good food my uncle walked out he'd go
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:48.240]  he'd go man it's good and and then maybe even you know kiss the
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:51.280]  you know kiss the two fingers the index and the thumb when they go together
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:54.800]  and people go look jones is doing a luma naughty program
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:01.280]  just like trump no actual psychology experts back when he was running in
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:05.200]  liberal and conservative publications had to admit no when trump puts his index
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:09.040]  and his thumb together he means he's committed i'm going to defend the
[1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:11.840]  borders i'm going to declare jerusalem you know the
[1:22:11.840 --> 1:22:16.160]  you know the capital i'm going to not go after your guns i'm going and then he
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:19.520]  puts that those fingers together that means i'm
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:23.280]  doing it means i plan to do it and i'm the exact same way
[1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:26.480]  and and it's there's video evidence of it and i i don't i don't know why do the
[1:22:26.480 --> 1:22:29.920]  same mannerisms trump does it's just to me growing up
[1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:35.120]  two thumbs up meant man this is really good even if you're on top of house
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:38.240]  roofing it or something you was when it was blowing you know
[1:22:38.240 --> 1:22:41.120]  grandpa's out at the truck getting more shingles off and
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:44.400]  hey you know are we going down for lunch you see grandpa dude you have both
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:47.040]  thumbs up i mean i think a lot of people use these
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:49.920]  mannerisms don't they but they make fun of the mannerisms because i because i
[1:22:49.920 --> 1:22:54.000]  caught myself coming in doing two thumbs up and just thought hey they're
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.200]  gonna get ripping trump off uh which no i mean we're just all doing this
[1:22:57.200 --> 1:23:00.880]  together two thumbs up means you know this is muy bueno
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:04.560]  doesn't muy bueno mean really good in spanish
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:08.880]  uh in fuego means on fire doesn't it the point is is that
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:12.560]  i got excited hearing that three and a half year old
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:16.560]  intro liner of confronting pierce morgan and i said listen
[1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:20.720]  you try to take our guns you keep pushing 1776 will commence again
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.000]  the republic will rise again well we just did it peacefully
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:29.520]  it's rising again getting trump inaugurated was the baby being born
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:32.800]  getting him into office was the baby starting to crawl
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:37.520]  the baby now is about six feet tall and 18 years old
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:41.280]  and it's about to really start kicking some butt
[1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:44.640]  because it's got a young man's brain and old man's heart
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:49.360]  took 18 years to get this far and that's why they're really scared right now
[1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:53.200]  because i'd say four years into this that you know
[1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:56.880]  this this this relaunch of the trumpian age
[1:23:56.880 --> 1:24:00.560]  it'll be about 40 years old a man in his pride
[1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:04.720]  in that cycle i'd say trump is reelected he's
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:09.680]  45 years old politically in that cycle and then he gets the other four years
[1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:13.520]  and delivers it'll be the old statesman
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:16.640]  the george washington part two to hand the baton
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:21.280]  legend that's why i said trump's so real even from a sociopathic perspective
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:24.480]  which he isn't but if he was his name's tied to this
[1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:28.560]  everything is on the line now to deliver and they say
[1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:31.760]  when people go sideways or try to change a bill or don't do what he's been
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:35.680]  pushing he will start screaming and and saying you are a
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:38.880]  traitor you are scum what is your problem we're going to commit we're
[1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:42.800]  going to deliver is that clear i will fire you right now and i will go out
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:46.320]  there to the cameras and i will tell people what a traitor you are do you
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:50.080]  understand that behind the scenes folks trumps just like this
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:54.240]  he's just for consumption doesn't act like it because that's how you get stuff
[1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:58.240]  done but only when you have to i was going to get to grass
[1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.960]  leave it down ranting i'll have to get to more grassy it's powerful we're going
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:04.880]  to play the grassy today i haven't got to the powerful party yet
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:09.280]  it's just that trump knows he's all tied up in you winning
[1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:13.280]  that it's it's all in ladies and gentlemen doesn't mean his perspective is
[1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:15.760]  perfect doesn't mean he'll get it all done no
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:18.720]  the vaccine stuff they appointed a pro vaccine guy
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:23.360]  who's even pushed forced inoculation to head up the center for disease control
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:26.480]  now that's a small part of the cdc's operation
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:29.520]  but still where's the committee where's the commission
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.640]  where's robert f kennedy jr trump is not delivering on that but
[1:25:34.640 --> 1:25:40.320]  if i was in a fist fight and and you know they land two blows and i land 15
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:42.720]  blows i'm not going to say i'm doing a bad job
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:45.520]  it's the same thing with trump he can't land every blow
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:49.760]  he's not superman so
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.520]  ladies and gentlemen he just pulled us out of the un unesco he just
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.880]  people are like oh he's wasting all the land out west he doesn't care
[1:25:56.880 --> 1:26:01.280]  he's stealing our public lands they take your land out of use
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:04.640]  in areas where they already had logging and they already had mining and we're
[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:08.800]  doing it safely so that globalist investments
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:12.880]  and chinese investments go up why do you think the chinese have 97 percent
[1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:17.600]  of rare earth mineral extraction worldwide because they don't follow any
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:21.280]  rules and they buy off governments and they don't care and the u.s has
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:25.120]  ended rare earth mineral extraction effectively
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:30.480]  i mean we don't have one lead mine they've shut down most of the gold mines
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:36.000]  we're a joke you can't have a country if you don't turn the resources on
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  so they tell you oh he just reversed two monuments he better reverse all 18 i
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.360]  looked it up last night obama designated 18
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:46.320]  areas wilderness or monument areas and took
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:50.640]  something like 20 million acres out of use i mean that is ridiculous
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:54.880]  the feds already have more than half the west in many states over 80 percent
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:00.720]  what do you need 95 percent in fact in utah it took it from what 88 percent
[1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:06.480]  to over 90 percent and shut down folks they go oh we designated
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:09.360]  yellowstone a global biosphere back in the 90s clinton did it
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:13.760]  there was a gold mine 54 miles away i visited it i covered it
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:17.520]  that they shut down saying oh you're now in the park
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:20.720]  they're like we're not in the park no one even can get get here there's one
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:25.280]  road in here there it is just from a couple years ago
[1:27:25.280 --> 1:27:29.040]  no that was actually the end of his term it was earlier this year obama's last
[1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:32.400]  minute land grabs only the tip of the presidential excess there it is the
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:36.400]  hill all trump did was say look the latest
[1:27:36.400 --> 1:27:41.680]  stuff you grabbed pac-man isn't yours comprende
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:45.040]  i'm in i just don't find any fault in trump
[1:27:45.040 --> 1:27:48.720]  there it is trumps rolling back obama's last minute land grab here's what must
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:52.080]  come next but the way the media spun this i had conservative friends come up to me
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:54.960]  and go hey your buddy trump's stealing the public's land
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:59.680]  oh all because they said that that oh that that oh trump took your public land
[1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:03.600]  the feds aren't even letting people four wheeler fish on most this now
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:07.520]  trump just kicked it back to the states or back to blm
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:11.680]  so they can't say it's a monument so you can go on it all he did
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:16.800]  was say you could go on the land and again it's not even about defending
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:20.960]  trump i am sick of the ignorance i'm sick of doing my homework i'm sick of
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:23.840]  being informed and having everybody else it seems around me
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:26.960]  just believe whatever crap comes out of the mainstream media
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:32.080]  i gotta tell you it's refreshing to see trump is like sickeningly on target
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:35.440]  it's like a 71 year old billionaire alex jones

[1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:33.040]  all right two days ago i got a call from the secret service
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:39.120]  and they were saying they want to work out a time to come visit with me
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:41.600]  in the next few days and i'm not going to get into when that's going to be
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:44.160]  happening but working on that right now
[1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:48.080]  and they said yeah no we got called from the senior folks in dc
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:50.960]  who read the pieces in the washington times they mentioned
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:54.400]  some other sites where i was laying out that they're openly saying they want to
[1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:56.960]  kill the president and they said you know what all do you
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:00.320]  know about this and i said it's on television you've got uh the former
[1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:03.280]  head of the cia saying we're going to remove him outside of impeachment
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:07.360]  extrajudicially that that tends to mean rendition or
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:12.080]  killing on the aspen institute and and brennan
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:14.880]  was there with clapper and they both nodded their heads with will blitzer
[1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:19.840]  then i said phil mud former head of counterterrorism
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:24.480]  in the cia that's direct action and then a deputy director of the fbi under
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:29.360]  muller said you know we're going to kill the president soon
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.400]  you got the hashtag hunt republicans we've got them canvassing
[1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:35.200]  republicans saying that they're soon going to be gone i do have sources i
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:38.320]  can't reveal there but i can call those members of congress if you'd like to
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:41.440]  talk to them and so that's all being worked out right now and the secret
[1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:46.320]  service said they are been directed to investigate
[1:34:46.320 --> 1:34:50.560]  uh my analysis of this notice the media hadn't picked up on this in two days
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:53.200]  because they want to make fun of it and all this stuff
[1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:55.920]  then they know it'll be get more attention because because they know
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:34:58.160]  they've been wanting to kill the president they know they've been pushing it
[1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:01.920]  and hyping it and all the rest of it and they know that we've collated it
[1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:05.840]  and shown where they talk about the succession and cog and
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:09.120]  how he needs to die in the new york times and cnn and all these
[1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:12.400]  hosts talking about it and saying the guy that shot congressman's police was a
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:16.800]  good guy that was also a wolf blitzer you know he he was a
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:19.840]  wasn't a terrorist he wasn't a bad guy he was mad about what's happening
[1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:22.640]  politically i mean there's so many examples of it
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:25.680]  it's crazy they're trying to hype somebody up to do it but they're also
[1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:30.400]  trying to telegraph they're strong and that they can
[1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:34.320]  remove the president and of course that's now come out uh out of the whole
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:38.880]  uh cia groups that are being quoted in major
[1:35:38.880 --> 1:35:42.320]  newspapers first picked up by the intercept that indeed
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:45.360]  they've got large groups of the cia direct action
[1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.240]  guarding the president since he was president elect
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:51.760]  uh and surveilling it and they've got what they call the tinfoil room
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:55.040]  where they travel around with the president watching everybody
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:58.880]  including the secret service the fbi because we know the globalists have
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:02.560]  moles in those groups so we've always known about those
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:05.040]  organizations and groups like a lot of it's not known i'm not going to get into
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:08.720]  it just because we've been involved since day one uh but
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:10.960]  that's what's going on and that's what's happening
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:14.800]  and so it's being taken very serious because there's been a move to get rid
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:18.000]  of the president by christmas they've been so arrogant they've
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:21.200]  telegraphed it to look powerful to other operatives in their
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:24.480]  criminal network in the deep state but it's not one monolithic deep state
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:28.560]  so i want to get matt bracket on he's a great strategist uh to give us his take
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:32.160]  on this and and now that the Mueller thing's falling apart and it really is
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:34.800]  i mean it's house of cards now that everybody's turning on them now that
[1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:37.520]  everybody knows that it was a cover-up for hillary who they thought they'd be
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:41.280]  president they are putting everything they've got together now
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:44.560]  on the dementia the 25th amendment that's failing
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:48.080]  so they're failing the only option they've gots plan c
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:51.040]  and so they've already canvassed congress and said he's going to be gone
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:55.440]  soon when we get rid of him you just don't do anything we won't get you next
[1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:58.960]  well congress is smart enough to know it'll be them next just like the
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:02.080]  soviets took over 1917 or the nazis got rid of the
[1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:05.360]  essay first none of the long knives i mean if you believe that like we're
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:08.640]  going to leave you alone we take out trump you need to stand down when we do
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:12.400]  i've gotten those phone calls okay and yes i've related to the secret service
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:15.600]  this isn't a game this is the real world everybody knows we predict things
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:18.480]  ahead of time because we're not predicting it we have the sources
[1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:21.680]  because we're crazy enough to put it out we we're fearless
[1:37:21.680 --> 1:37:25.120]  but we're not fearless we realize if we're not fearless we're going to lose
[1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:28.400]  so we're afraid to lose it so we're fearless get that folks so matt bracket
[1:37:28.400 --> 1:37:31.760]  former navy seal counterterrorism expert can also speak about the israel thing
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:34.960]  so he did a lot of his work uh you just heard my analysis
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:38.320]  what would you like to say to the secret service about what's going on i know
[1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:40.800]  you've read this stuff as well what's your analysis
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:43.840]  what do you expect them to throw at trump right now do you agree that the
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:48.560]  wheels have completely come off their bs uh russia fantasy
[1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:53.680]  no doubt this this is up this is a bureaucratic operation valkyrie
[1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:57.440]  just like the movie or the world war two uh deal with the uh
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:01.200]  you know the attempt to take out hitler the coup plotters
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:04.880]  they have the media still so they have their broadcasting
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:07.920]  that the new government is in charge in berlin but it's
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:11.600]  you know even as they're talking the doors are being broken down
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:15.520]  um this morning jim jordan he had the most explosive testimony
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:18.320]  actually he was asking it in the form of a question to ray
[1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:22.320]  which ray refused to answer which was did the assassin
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:28.720]  the political assassin struck did he was either the fusion gps cut out
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:33.600]  that gave the dirty dossier to the faiza court it he wasn't thrown out just
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:38.080]  over some some emails some texts to his girlfriend
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:41.520]  miss page that's not it that's the cover story
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:45.040]  jordan wouldn't have said that if he didn't know it he was just putting it on
[1:38:45.040 --> 1:38:50.400]  the record today so we it's just i i would assume 95 percent certainty
[1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:55.040]  strock was the guy that that delivered the dirty dossier to the faiza court
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:58.720]  to use that to leverage that into the intelligence community
[1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:02.960]  surveilling the trump campaign and then the the trump transition
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:08.880]  team if that happened there's no way even even uh you know abc nbc cbs
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:12.080]  cnn they won't be able to embargo that news
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:15.600]  so then the only thing that they've got left after this
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:19.600]  the muller comey uh operation valkyrie is falling apart
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:23.760]  is to signal to the crazy people the minions out there
[1:39:23.760 --> 1:39:27.200]  to try to do something to take trump out directly because he's such a crazy
[1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:30.320]  person such a threat and i'll remind people
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:36.720]  anwar sadat and indira ghandi were both assassinated by people in uniform
[1:39:36.720 --> 1:39:41.520]  you know with government-issued guns indira ghandi was killed by uh
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:45.280]  they were seeks actually but they were her most trusted bodyguard and by the
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:48.560]  way since day one trumps known that and that's why he's at his own
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:51.120]  let's just say special security that nobody sees
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:55.040]  yeah one of one of the biggest stories of the last year and most underreported
[1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:58.880]  amazing bombshell story is that the garland texas
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:02.000]  draw a mohammed event which had girt wilters
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.760]  uh pam of pam geller and robert spencer there
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:12.480]  an fbi special agent was accompanying the assassins from arizona
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:17.760]  to the garland texas event was in the car behind them texting them tear up
[1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:22.560]  texas he wasn't there to stop them he was there probably to like in case they
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:25.760]  got pulled over by local cops to make sure they weren't impeded
[1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:29.840]  he fled at when the security guard killed the jihad assassins
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:34.080]  he was an fbi special agent that's who they've been hiring for the last 10
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:37.120]  years you can't assume that somebody with a federal
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:41.600]  badge isn't a crazy social justice warrior that's who they've been hiring
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:44.720]  well yeah look at reality winner literally joined ices
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:48.320]  hated all white people who know she was white completely bonkers and they had
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:51.680]  her in a very high level top security clearance and they have just
[1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:55.680]  flooded the government with complete lunatics and you're right
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:59.520]  that's going to be their move is activating their mental patients
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:03.200]  inside inside we're not saying the whole secret service is bad or the fbi
[1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:07.360]  or or you know you a cook at the white house but this is definitely
[1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:10.800]  what we're facing they're signaling to the lunatics
[1:41:10.800 --> 1:41:17.120]  while i got a minute i i can't i have to mention in 1979 on this day
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:20.800]  bud's class 105 graduated that's why i'm wearing this today
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:25.200]  who y'all 105 who y'all all frogmen all seals all udt
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:29.600]  it's the the best bunch of guys i was ever associated with in my entire life
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:33.760]  and uh all i i just wanted to say that there are a lot more great loyal
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:37.680]  patriots out there not just the frogmen special forces
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:41.120]  rangers up and down the military that take their
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:44.320]  their oath very seriously to to protect the
[1:41:44.320 --> 1:41:48.960]  the uh the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:52.960]  and if something like this happens whether it's mule and comey's operation
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:58.400]  valkyrie uh coup or uh them triggering a maniac to try to
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:03.120]  to take trump out it won't work guys because if that ever happened
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:07.040]  thousands of people would take up their arms and we know who the traitors are
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:10.800]  there wouldn't be any huge plot it wouldn't be like marching on washington
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:14.800]  but the the traitors would be swinging from lamp posts i guarantee you
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:17.840]  well i think they realize that and suddenly i'm seeing democrats and even
[1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:20.960]  the democrats on fox news turn against hillary and comey
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:24.880]  it just happened the last 24 hours they know even more is about to come out and
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:27.760]  here's the big breaking news we'll hit when we come back it's not just
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:30.800]  strock and all these other fb agents they know that they're holding back on
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:33.600]  because they don't want to quote hurt the agency too bad
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:38.000]  i can confirm they've got bombs she'll stuff far worse than this top doj official

[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.720]  we're seeing cnn had to admit he's done everything he said he'd do
[1:47:44.720 --> 1:47:48.400]  and the other stuff he's starting to get done
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:51.440]  and now their whole russian investigation as we knew is a fraud i mean
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:54.080]  they're calling me a russian agent and saying they had proof but never showing
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:58.480]  it i mean it's like telling me again i'm a space alien i don't even know i am

[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:10.240]  they clearly wanted to get hillary and his president they thought that she was
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:12.880]  going to win so they could commit all the crimes they wanted
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:15.760]  and they fought so hard and so recklessly because they're afraid
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:17.600]  trump will go after him for what they've done
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:21.120]  he was willing to leave him alone let him sell off in the sunset
[1:48:21.120 --> 1:48:24.720]  but they tried to destroy trump they try to destroy me and drudge they've had
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:27.200]  they're having hearings they're censoring us right now i mean
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:30.400]  we're starting to win but the battle is still raging i'm gonna talk to matt
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:34.480]  bracken about where he sees this going and
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:38.320]  other things that we need to watch out for he's a great anti-terrorism expert
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:41.280]  and best-selling author he's got a new book out he's put out for free
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:44.960]  in the information war but briefly ladies and gentlemen
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:51.120]  i want to encourage all of the listeners to go to infowarstore.com
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:56.000]  and get our latest product we've launched several new products great pro
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:00.400]  biotics we've launched a digestive enzyme spectrum
[1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:02.880]  one of the top companies the u.s developed that helps you get more
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:06.880]  nutrients and absorb proteins and fats better
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:11.040]  that's the carnivore product but alpha power is targeted at men but it's for
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:16.800]  women as well and it has lj 100 is the most potent
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:20.640]  highest quality and most studied extract in the category
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:24.480]  which is boost sports performance increases physical and mental energy helps
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:28.800]  maintain normal high free to test their own levels in men boost healthy alpha
[1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:32.800]  pheromones and more improve sleep quality encourages
[1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:37.360]  prostate health helps support healthy cholesterol levels
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:40.880]  again it makes you awake when you take it but then it makes you sleepy when it's
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:44.560]  time in your regular cycle and let me tell you something
[1:49:44.560 --> 1:49:48.800]  it's 50 times stronger than leading competitors we can actually say that
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:52.000]  because women out and got the lj 100 and all the other stuff that's in it it's
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  ridiculous so if you like
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:59.440]  anthroplex and if you like supermail they're great a lot of you probably want
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:03.040]  to stay with those and they're high quality they're cold pressed
[1:50:03.040 --> 1:50:06.240]  this is also extracted in the system that doesn't use a bunch of heat
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:10.320]  but let me tell you something it is i said i want something that's thermal
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:13.440]  nuclear i want something for people that want
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:17.520]  of the over the top but i'm telling you it's all seen as generally safe
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:21.520]  we can make a lot of claims about it uh the stuff out there there's nothing out
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:25.200]  there like it there's crap out there it's not even as strong for $100
[1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:28.800]  so it normally at $69 it's inexpensive it's $34.95
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:33.440]  50% off out of the gates even though it cost me a lot to produce this
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:37.280]  i mean we're talking tens of thousands of dollars per kilo
[1:50:37.280 --> 1:50:42.880]  of just the lj 100 versus other people that just get the crap stuff that they
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:46.480]  from the herb but it's not even as strong it's 50 times weaker so again

[1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:44.160]  folks up as well because a lot of people aren't political but
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.480]  they'll read an exciting novel like the novels you write and james wasley ral's
[1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:51.280]  right so we'll talk about some of those as well i'll get you back soon just on
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:54.480]  the novels but first
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:58.640]  matt bracken without me even bringing it up earlier compared the attempts to
[1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:02.400]  overthrow trump not which is fake investigations but winding up crazy to
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:05.600]  killing and saying he'll soon be a sassinator to soon be gone
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:08.560]  with operation valkyrie and what happened in world war two and that's the
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:13.280]  parallel and i noticed that obama just came out yesterday it's on drugsreport.com
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:16.000]  to them for wars.com article paul joseph watson
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:21.120]  obama warns trump will lead america into genocide like hitler
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:26.080]  obama compares trump to hitler implies america like the 1930s nazi germany
[1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:30.320]  yeah did so hitler let the jews go to israel or whatever could help
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:35.200]  i mean this is crazy folks whose hitlerian is the national socialist
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:38.080]  and the democratic party they're the ones that act like thugs
[1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:42.080]  beating everybody up so that ties into what you were saying earlier
[1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:45.840]  what do you make of obama invokes hitler
[1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:49.520]  saying that trump is basically hitler and is undemocratic when they're the
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:52.720]  ones trying to kick out an elected president
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:56.000]  i could i would say that this is the same as people
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:53:00.400]  encouraging an assassination of trump what obama is trying to do
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:04.640]  without coming directly out and saying it is calling for like a massive
[1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:08.640]  intifada against trump and against europeans in general
[1:53:08.640 --> 1:53:12.400]  um i think that they see the wheels coming off of the
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:17.520]  the muller coup plot and um i think that what we're going to see in the next
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:20.960]  few days with that is is muller will will say that there's
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:25.200]  really no more charges that he can find uh the you know they'll proceed against
[1:53:25.200 --> 1:53:29.360]  flin but very minimal results they're going to try to wind it down and if
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:32.080]  anything comey will be left out to dry
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:35.520]  what's the deal that miller is going to make for self-preservation
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:39.840]  is to blame comey for all the leaks so comey's going to be the big leaker and
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:42.880]  take the fall comey's going to go into the reservoir
[1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:46.800]  you know tied to the anchor so people are right now trying to
[1:53:46.800 --> 1:53:49.920]  to make their own their own deals obama calling
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:53.760]  you know basically saying uh trump is hitler is the same as
[1:53:53.760 --> 1:53:57.200]  if trump is hitler then you're justified in killing trump
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:54:00.800]  you know that's a classic uh you know uh sociology
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:04.480]  question if you knew that you had a baby hitler would you strangle him in the
[1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:07.360]  crib you know would it be so that's what obama is
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:11.040]  trying to do but it's too late the the coup has already passed
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:14.560]  you know tom cruise is still in the building but he's got no more phones
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:19.440]  they just cut off his phone service you know that i did want to mention um
[1:54:19.440 --> 1:54:24.080]  it's a total coincidence this week i put all my books on a kindle free run
[1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:28.880]  this one is free today castigo key but it's all leading up the whole reason i'm
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:31.920]  doing it this is my counter jihad novel the red
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:35.440]  cliffs is their hoon and i want british people in particular to download and
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:38.480]  read this book it'll be free tomorrow and saturday
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:42.160]  so these books are free all well they were free the rest of the week
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:46.320]  but today it's this one tomorrow and saturday red cliffs
[1:54:46.320 --> 1:54:49.520]  it's a counter jihad novel i don't care how many people download it the more
[1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:52.720]  the better it'll cost nothing just go and click
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:57.440]  anyway we aren't we are in a war right now i see the jerusalem move
[1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:01.360]  as trump putting his chips into the counter jihad side
[1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:05.840]  this is a huge pushback against mur and the rest that's right it's beyond
[1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:09.440]  calling a bluff it's it's saying we recognize israel
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:12.800]  jihad is spreading islam is spreading all of the world the green is spreading
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:17.040]  across the map christianity is shrinking europe's turned itself over to islam
[1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:20.880]  we're not doing it and if you want to do a global infatata
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:24.560]  infatata bring it on you know so so instead of
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:28.720]  shrinking and saying well we don't want to upset the moderate muslims
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.960]  he's saying jerusalem's the capital what are you going to do about a punk
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:37.440]  you know it's that kind of a move literally so i would expect to see some
[1:55:37.440 --> 1:55:40.560]  you know spectacular terrorist events this christmas
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:44.080]  uh you know truck attacks things like that even though they've got the
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:48.640]  alahu ak barriers up all over europe you can't go to a christmas event in
[1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:51.280]  europe that it doesn't look like a style ag
[1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:55.120]  you know in terms of the security with metal detectors and jersey barricades
[1:55:55.120 --> 1:55:58.400]  all the way around and they tell german women don't wear short skirts now and
[1:55:58.400 --> 1:56:02.800]  expanding on that sweden wants to make it illegal to even say that a muslim
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:07.200]  engages in a crime if they are making it illegal and if you expand on that
[1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:10.240]  look at turkey they claim they were moderate while they merged with europe
[1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:13.600]  now urgun leads the radical jihad movement and is saying we're going to
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:17.600]  flood you with 50 million and take you over i mean i mean islam always does
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:20.800]  this friendly act until they get to a certain point
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:23.840]  yeah i think that this is coming to a boil now
[1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:29.760]  uh two years ago i wrote a story comparing this coming global into fata to
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:33.040]  to the tet uprising and i think i was early on my
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:36.000]  my timing but i still think that it's coming
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  in in europe it's so blatant now when you have to you can't go down the street
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:43.520]  without passing between anti truck barricades
[1:56:43.520 --> 1:56:46.960]  it's rather obvious why those anti truck barricades are up
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:49.760]  even if they try to dress them up like christmas presents
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:52.560]  you know it's because of the muslims that have come
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:56.400]  that are still full of you know jihad anger just they just
[1:56:56.400 --> 1:57:00.640]  in between trump retweeting the the truthful videos of the
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:03.600]  you know the handicapped dutch boy being beaten up
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:07.520]  the um teenager being thrown off a building presumably homosexual
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:11.680]  and the virgin mary statue being smashed these are all real
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:16.640]  real videos the the british elites the quizlings they went crazy
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:20.560]  and then and then therese may has an assassination plot against her
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:24.320]  you know like the next day a jihad assassination attempt you know you think
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:27.600]  these jihadis would get out of these hellholes they're in and show up
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:30.400]  somewhere like in germany and everything's free or england here's a
[1:57:30.400 --> 1:57:34.640]  free house they're like no i'm gonna kill you and i mean it's just like it's

[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:46.560]  just crazy matt bracken former navy seal best-selling author
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:49.600]  research we had about four or five months left in this segment you got cut
[2:00:49.600 --> 2:00:53.520]  off by the brakes i want to hear what it was you were trying to get to but
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:00:56.320]  i mean you agree the globalists are getting around it all over the world
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:01.440]  they're being exposed nationalism's rising uh the the the globalist attempt
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:05.440]  to invade even more with with radical islam to accelerate that
[2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:08.640]  i think finally even triggered good elements of the deep state
[2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:12.320]  to realize that this was maker to break it and now
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:15.200]  the attempts to put everybody back under their control i think you're gonna
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:18.240]  backfire matt bracken so what else do you expect to
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:21.840]  happen as this war goes into overdrive and as trump
[2:01:21.840 --> 2:01:27.440]  throws down the gauntlet well what we see on the outside is probably days or
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:30.400]  weeks after it's really happening on the inside
[2:01:30.400 --> 2:01:33.440]  and we sort of see the shadow of the pendulum moving
[2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:39.600]  but today we saw uh bruce or get fired at doj like you said they're taking out
[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:44.320]  the the obama staybehinds and some of these guys no doubt
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:48.000]  are going to be left in place uh having flipped
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:51.280]  and now they're going to be rounding up and this is a message to these guys what
[2:01:51.280 --> 2:01:55.360]  i'm saying now the ones that the the staybehinds that have flipped
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:58.640]  are now going to be collecting evidence against the
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:04.400]  more diehard coup plotters you know this is a bureaucratic operation valkyrie
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:08.880]  and we're now seeing the end stages it's fabulous watching history unfold
[2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:12.720]  what jim jordan said this morning i'm sure he didn't say it without cause
[2:02:12.720 --> 2:02:16.480]  that strock who's you know the the guy who protected hillary
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:20.160]  and then went after trump if he was the fusion gps
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:24.160]  dirty dossier man who used that to get a fiza warrant
[2:02:24.160 --> 2:02:27.200]  this now is something that is going to be beyond watergate
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:30.640]  and it could be used for a real clean sweep and purge
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:34.160]  which is going to take some doing because they've been hiring social justice
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:37.680]  warriors for 10 years you know there's an entire cadre
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:41.680]  an entire generation of of federal employees
[2:02:41.680 --> 2:02:45.760]  that are basically marxists so it's going to be a continuing battle to find
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:49.920]  these guys and isolate them but it's it's hopeful finally i mean this
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:52.880]  the plot is coming apart there's there's no doubt about that we're going to have
[2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:56.000]  that jim jordan clip coming up in the next segment we have some more guests
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.680]  they're experts on this joining us but uh this is an epic time to be alive and
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:02.880]  by the way when the secret service called me it wasn't like oh alex give us
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:05.760]  your help when they're really investigating me this was serious
[2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:10.160]  this came from dc uh and they are like looking at at criminal investigations
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:13.760]  they are looking at the plot and they said what else do you have
[2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.280]  uh and they're ready to go talk to folks in congress
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:21.280]  who've had the democrats come in canvas them that hey we're taking your boss out
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:24.960]  you want to work with us i mean they've really pushed it and i think trump
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:28.320]  strong enough to not just leave him in the shadows now after they're defeated
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:31.360]  they need to be fully routed they need to all be arrested and i think that's
[2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:34.560]  going to end up happening i think now they don't want them to know that so so
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:37.920]  they act even more violently but i think we've passed the point of
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:42.000]  return here matt yeah and and that's why he
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:46.800]  trump very wisely did not fire muhler firing muhler which was would be his
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:52.000]  constitutional uh right would have just uh played to the democrats led to you
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:56.880]  know calls for impeachment and so forth now watch for muhler to begin backpedaling
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:00.160]  and saying well i'm winding up the investigation basically meaning
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:04.320]  please let me get out of town without handcuffs on and if you need to arrest
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:09.120]  somebody as the leader of operation valkyrie it's that guy comey the leaker
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:14.640]  you know i i made that coup trap meme months ago with the four corners being
[2:04:14.640 --> 2:04:19.280]  comey muhler rozenstein and mccabe and yesterday i added
[2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:24.160]  uh strock weissman strock and weissman but they these are the ringleaders and
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:27.680]  the whole world knows it the whole world knows it
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:30.320]  and they're working for the clinton foundation they're all getting money from
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:36.080]  it iranium one i mean these guys are bold i'll give matt mad they are bold
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:41.200]  muhler has to watch out because he was on duty during the iranium one himself
[2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:44.480]  oh yeah he ended the investigation of the fbi all right
[2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:48.320]  145 million absolutely enemies far under domestic dot com matt
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:54.320]  rackham always amazing thank you sir

[2:04:59.120 --> 2:05:02.160]  move that some say will shake the middle east to the core
[2:05:02.160 --> 2:05:05.440]  israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with trump's announcement
[2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:09.440]  the turkish president warned trump that recognizing jerusalem as the capital of
[2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:12.720]  israel was a red line the saudis are calling this a flagrant
[2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:15.840]  provocation of muslims and palestinian leaders have already

[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:32.320]  ahead of president trump's announcement the u.s military deployed
[2:05:32.320 --> 2:05:36.400]  additional forces throughout the middle east in anticipation of widespread
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:40.240]  political unrest and even terror attacks although some u.s officials had
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:42.640]  urged trump not to make this sort of a move
[2:05:42.640 --> 2:05:46.000]  u.s policy should never be dictated by threats of violence
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:49.760]  with the opposition against trump's historic decision building the days
[2:05:49.760 --> 2:05:56.000]  ahead could turn out to be tumultuous leon macadoo info wars dot com
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:01.200]  well you've got it got it thank you for coming to you

[2:06:40.400 --> 2:06:44.160]  uh the san anna winds blasting in a hurricane force
[2:06:44.160 --> 2:06:48.160]  the police and firefighters completely exhausted pray for those folks
[2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:52.640]  the whole fbi democrat fake investigation imploding
[2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:56.480]  uh again i saw the canary in the coal mines democrats
[2:06:56.480 --> 2:07:01.520]  even on cnn msnbc distancing themselves from comey
[2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:07.520]  and hillary and all these resignations that are happening
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:11.280]  don't you think glenn beckon all the neocons and the weekly standard people
[2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:14.240]  and all the rest of them that thought that they could be
[2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:17.680]  never trumpers and stop this revolution to restore the republic
[2:07:17.680 --> 2:07:22.880]  don't you think they feel dumb now decimating their audiences turning their
[2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:27.280]  audiences off and missing out on me on the right side of history
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:30.480]  i don't want to be too confident right now but even if they kill trump it's
[2:07:30.480 --> 2:07:34.960]  going to blow up in their face and even if they do this whole phony indictment
[2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:38.400]  still i hope they go ahead with it by
[2:07:38.400 --> 2:07:44.240]  frankly i don't think roger stone is is is is is
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:47.600]  right at this point i i don't think trump should fire comey
[2:07:47.600 --> 2:07:50.800]  now now stone had the idea first to create another special counsel to
[2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:54.720]  investigate comey and investigate meal or excuse me fire meal or
[2:07:54.720 --> 2:08:00.240]  same same thing same person basically same institution
[2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:05.040]  his idea of having a special counsel is now being picked up i saw it on fox
[2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:09.600]  news this morning on two different shows so
[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:13.440]  it's now definitely happening and the recovery of the of the united states
[2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:17.520]  could actually happen doesn't mean we're out of the woods
[2:08:17.520 --> 2:08:21.920]  doesn't mean everything's perfect but it is a very very exciting time to be
[2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:24.320]  alive
[2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:28.240]  now i want to get to more of the senator grassley speech
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:31.360]  that he gave last night on the senate it's very very powerful we're gonna go to
[2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:36.480]  part two of that in a moment uh grassley outlines political bias of fbi
[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:40.320]  officials and grassley is impeccably bipartisan
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:43.040]  and he realizes the will of the people's turned against this
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:46.800]  folks really see through the witch hunt now and that's why you see the usual
[2:08:46.800 --> 2:08:50.880]  suspects acting super confident going he will go to prison he had the nuisance
[2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:53.280]  around his neck everyone associated with trump will be in
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:57.520]  prison for life he is insane he is he is evil he is hitler these are all
[2:08:57.520 --> 2:09:04.000]  quotes from obama and uh morning sloppy joe and
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:10.240]  brzezinski's dropping and all of it is a big news creature
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:13.680]  it's a big news brzezinski's leaving excuse me that's her name
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:19.200]  so you've got all of this happening and it's just an incredible time to be alive
[2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:22.960]  because the people are awake the people are awake not just here but all the
[2:09:22.960 --> 2:09:27.120]  world they're waking up more it's a great time of renewal happening
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:31.200]  there's going to be fits and pains and probably bad stuff happening but an
[2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:35.360]  awake population is 50 times better than one that isn't awake
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:39.760]  now briefly before i do this grassley clip we have a new product that i know
[2:09:39.760 --> 2:09:42.720]  is going to end up being our number one best seller i know it is because i've

[2:11:19.760 --> 2:11:23.280]  thank you all for your support let's start getting to more of the grassley here
[2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:26.960]  as i promised to do there's a senator grassley republican
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:30.560]  uh getting into outlining political bias of fbi officials and i've got clips of
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:33.520]  the new fbi director incoming getting into some things
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:36.960]  jim jordan pushes fb on ties between peter strock
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:40.800]  and trump surveillance and the ppgate dossier that's now coming out they did
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:43.840]  and they have another high level justice department officials just to step
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:47.280]  down completely not to stop the investigation for being
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:52.240]  clinton operatives show here's more of senator grassley
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:55.760]  it is interesting that before he was fired
[2:11:55.760 --> 2:12:00.320]  fbi director comey lectured our judiciary committee
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:04.000]  and lectured the public about how the men and women
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  of the fbi quote don't give a rip about politics
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:16.080]  end a quote i believe that for most of the hardworking
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:22.000]  rank and file fbi agents that is absolutely true
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:26.560]  their jobs normally don't involve controversial political questions
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:30.960]  and their own political views aren't relevant
[2:12:30.960 --> 2:12:38.080]  because they are professionals but no human is perfect
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:46.480]  and no organization is immune from air it does no good
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:52.480]  for the leaders of the fbi to pretend that its senior management is above
[2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:58.720]  all reproach that they would never show any improper political
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:05.760]  bias and would never make mistakes the only way to protect against
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:10.560]  bias or misconduct is to recognize that exist
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:14.800]  and to confront it not to hide it from congress
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:21.920]  and the american people the law and the facts is gonna blow up in their face
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:27.600]  should guide the work of the fbi and the justice department you're all going to
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:32.960]  jail politics infest infected the department's decisions
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:37.120]  during a hotly contested national political campaign
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:41.680]  we would have to look at it that is true whether it occurred in the clinton
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:47.920]  case or in the trump russia case or if it included both
[2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:52.560]  anyone claiming to do bipartisan oversight of the exeggity branch
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:58.960]  has to examine both ignoring either half of this story
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:03.760]  simply won't be credible with the other half
[2:14:03.760 --> 2:14:07.360]  i love the fact they tried it i love the fact they tried it everyone
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:10.960]  thought hillary clinton was going to be president
[2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:16.160]  everyone not me and the perception of a huge segment of the public
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:20.720]  is that the whole washington establishment worked overtime
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:23.920]  to get her name cleared before the democrat convention
[2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:29.200]  last summer that's right the fbi even called its case
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:34.320]  quote on quote mid-year exam
[2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:39.920]  director comey testified that the former attorney general refused to even name
[2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:45.280]  the fbi's work and investigation
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:49.360]  that's how political it came and she went on the tarmac
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:52.960]  the attorney general at that time insisting on calling
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:57.760]  it not an investigation but quote on quote a matter
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:15:02.080]  m-a-t-t-e-r and that's the same opera means
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:05.520]  we've learned that director comey started drafting his
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:10.320]  exoneration statement long before the investigation was done
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:14.240]  it looks like there was a rush to clear her
[2:15:14.240 --> 2:15:18.560]  it looks like the fix was in wow let's stop right there i know
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:22.240]  i'm going to come back but let's back to about 20 seconds i mean
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:25.520]  they've got them and more witnesses are coming forward and they've got
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:28.560]  their communications now that they're under investigation
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:33.200]  how they were rigging all this they were so arrogant because this trash
[2:15:33.200 --> 2:15:36.160]  at the top of the fbi on the justice department has been there
[2:15:36.160 --> 2:15:40.960]  since the clinton's and they just do whatever they want tarmac meetings that
[2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:45.120]  are illegal russian deals chinese deals chinese generals

[2:20:31.280 --> 2:20:37.280]  and there's beer in texas canna really exciting things you got senator
[2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:42.480]  grassley up there on the floor of the senate saying the public thinks the
[2:20:42.480 --> 2:20:46.000]  fix is in and the public's angry
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.680]  with this whole fake FBI investigation and now the democratic pundits aren't
[2:20:49.680 --> 2:20:52.640]  turning against hillary not turning into Hollywood
[2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:57.760]  the whole thing's falling apart and they're saying oh it looks really bad
[2:20:57.760 --> 2:21:02.240]  it's political they did this to destroy trump and get rid of the election
[2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:05.040]  they were so arrogant they've written articles about how they're gonna
[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:08.000]  get rid of trump and then suspend the whole election and get rid of any
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.240]  republicans that were elected but leave democrats in and then have a
[2:21:12.240 --> 2:21:16.080]  new elections with homeland security in charge and obama signed
[2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:20.720]  orders before he left federalizing homeland security
[2:21:20.720 --> 2:21:25.760]  i mean these guys are obvious and when you're awake
[2:21:25.760 --> 2:21:29.600]  they're really obvious i got a clip with jim jordan
[2:21:29.600 --> 2:21:32.800]  pushes up the eye on ties between peter strock
[2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:36.240]  have pronounced his name and trump surveillance we know the surveillance is
[2:21:36.240 --> 2:21:39.360]  being run by him we know he did it with the pp dossier
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:42.480]  that's all fake that's how they ran the fraud that's how they got the illegal
[2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:44.960]  surveillance that was the plan they thought they'd find
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:48.720]  something because they were all in bed with the russians
[2:21:48.720 --> 2:21:53.280]  that's big money they can't believe trump isn't like you
[2:21:53.280 --> 2:21:59.760]  he's not a sack of garbage like you so let's go back to senator
[2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:03.440]  shut grassy and then we'll go to jim jordan here is
[2:22:03.440 --> 2:22:07.280]  part of what he was saying we've learned that director comey
[2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:12.160]  started drafting his exoneration statement long before the investigation was
[2:22:12.160 --> 2:22:17.280]  done it looks like there was a rush to clear her
[2:22:17.280 --> 2:22:21.680]  it looks like the fix was in i know grammar
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:27.040]  democrats don't want to hear that they only want to talk about trump
[2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:32.560]  there is a double standard here in the way that they desperately want to go
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:36.880]  after the president but ignore all other
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:41.840]  potential wrongdoing in the previous administration
[2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:48.160]  it stinks to high heaven but democrats have visions of impeachment
[2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:54.320]  dancing in their heads rather than reserve judgment and carefully
[2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:59.520]  examined the facts all of the facts they're jumping to
[2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:04.000]  all sorts of conclusions the judiciary committee has an
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:09.600]  obligation to do both a deep dive into the firing of james comey
[2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:14.480]  and both of the two controversial political investigations
[2:23:14.480 --> 2:23:19.840]  that preceded it unfortunately the democrats are preventing any truly
[2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:24.160]  bipartisan path forward they appear to be assuming the
[2:23:24.160 --> 2:23:28.880]  conclusion at the outset they complained publicly
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:33.920]  and they complained privately that i'm not doing enough to investigate
[2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:40.880]  obstruction but obstruction of justice is a legal term of art
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:44.960]  it is a conclusion not evidence that's right
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:49.120]  that is not how i conduct my investigation exactly
[2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:53.760]  i do not make my conclusions first and try to shoehorn
[2:23:53.760 --> 2:24:00.080]  the facts to fit my conclusions i try to get the facts and then go where
[2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:05.040]  those facts lead to pause real quick let's people keep asking why we're so
[2:24:05.040 --> 2:24:07.840]  accurate and how we know stuff other people
[2:24:07.840 --> 2:24:11.520]  don't know and how we predict things that are like 95 percent accurate
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:16.080]  because i don't get up here and predict things because i want to make it true
[2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:21.200]  like Oprah Winfrey and the secret i don't believe in that
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:24.480]  i go off of history research and and and and being
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:28.320]  immersed in this to then tell you where i think things are going
[2:24:28.320 --> 2:24:31.360]  that's why we're so accurate it's like our government listens other
[2:24:31.360 --> 2:24:35.440]  governments listen i mean get tomorrow's news today
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:38.720]  get next year's news today at info wars dot com
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:42.080]  and that's just what grassley's saying here
[2:24:42.080 --> 2:24:45.680]  trumps mr americana he never built jack in russia
[2:24:45.680 --> 2:24:49.520]  there's nothing there let's continue
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:53.360]  better examples of where investigations have uncovered facts
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:58.960]  that point to quote on quote obstruction bill clinton and richard nixon
[2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:04.240]  both lied to investigators that is obstruction and that behavior got one
[2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:07.920]  of them impeached and forced the other to resign
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:11.120]  we also recently learned that hillary clinton's lawyers
[2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:18.240]  used a program called bleach bit to delete 33 000 emails
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:21.680]  under subpoena by the house of representatives that's open and shut
[2:25:21.680 --> 2:25:26.720]  obstruction now those government records and they are government records
[2:25:26.720 --> 2:25:31.120]  can never be recovered those facts certainly
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:35.920]  looked like obstruction oh we don't have all the facts here yet
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:41.840]  so far i've seen no credible evidence that president trump
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:48.000]  has told anyone to lie i also have seen no credible evidence
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  that here is the aids have destroyed records being sought by investigators
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:58.320]  many people firmly believe that the president fired the fbi director in
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:02.080]  order to improperly hold an investigation of lieutenant general
[2:26:02.080 --> 2:26:06.800]  flin now i'm not only willing but i'm
[2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:10.560]  eager to delve deeply into all the circumstances
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:17.680]  surrounding director comey's removal but to claim at the outset that his
[2:26:17.680 --> 2:26:22.720]  removal was obstruction of justice puts the cart
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:25.920]  before the horse and then you can't ever have a real
[2:26:25.920 --> 2:26:29.760]  investigation because you just botched it it's a mistrial and then you got the
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:33.520]  transcripts of doing u.s. interest on the phone so there's no crime
[2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:38.560]  to have obstruction to begin with it's baloney
[2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:42.800]  beyond baloney i wanted to say bravo sierra
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:49.360]  here's jim jordan congressman pushes fbi on ties between peter strock
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:52.560]  and the trump surveillance and they already know all this
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:55.920]  they just are letting them put the noose around their neck
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:27:00.400]  and act like they don't know this is really shameful the fbi sees the come
[2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:03.520]  clean on democratic operatives that penetrated them
[2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:06.960]  or the fbi is going to be finished i got your changer name
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:10.240]  and i'm not just saying that you've got to come clean now and get rid of these
[2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:13.600]  people or it's it's just you're going to be politically
[2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:18.720]  mud like you know your name is mud like mud's great great grand paul helping
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:21.280]  kill kennedy i mean helping kill the lincoln
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:25.040]  uh your name's mud and still today you want to kill the president here uh
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:28.240]  let's go or says he's gonna be killed he's running around free i'm
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:31.040]  we're gonna kill him we're gonna kill him i'm a former head of counterterrorism
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:33.760]  that did stuff like that i'm gonna kill we're gonna kill him soon
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:38.240]  let me know comes a secret service bro so uh let's go to the congressman
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:42.080]  i mean there are all kinds of people on moeller's team who are pro clinton
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:45.280]  there's been all kinds of story political fact reported 96 percent of the top
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:49.280]  lawyers uh contributions went to clinton or obama
[2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:52.720]  but peter struck the guy who ran the clinton investigation interviewed
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:56.720]  mills avidine interviewed secretary clinton changed gross negligence a crime
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:00.560]  to the term extreme carelessness who ran the russian investigation who
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:03.920]  interviewed mike flinn gets put on moeller's team
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:10.080]  and then he gets kicked off for a text message that's anti-trump
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:13.520]  if he kicked everybody off moeller's team it was anti-trump i don't think
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:17.280]  there'd be anybody left bingo so here there's gotta be
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:21.280]  something more here it's for optics it can't just be some text messages
[2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:24.880]  that show a pro-clinton anti-trump bias no he made up the he's gotta be
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:28.080]  something more and i'm trying to figure out what it is

[2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:23.760]  you keep saying you've got something for me
[2:33:23.760 --> 2:33:29.520]  something you call love but confess you've been a messin

[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:41.600]  i gotta tell you trump is delivering even cnn has the big articles saying he's
[2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:44.640]  following all his promises or trying to get the others done
[2:33:44.640 --> 2:33:47.360]  and they say that's a bad thing that you're not supposed to keep promises
[2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:51.200]  meanwhile obama compares him to hitler and says he'll commit genocide clearly
[2:33:51.200 --> 2:33:54.800]  trying to get an assassination going secret service is investigating
[2:33:54.800 --> 2:33:58.320]  democratic operatives and others for their statements they've told me they
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:02.320]  are investigating under the direction of the president
[2:34:02.320 --> 2:34:07.120]  from dc secret service i talked to were pretty amazed but
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:10.080]  the point is we we we are pointing all this out
[2:34:10.080 --> 2:34:12.880]  and i'm surprised other people have it co-edited all together or made a big
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:16.400]  deal but mainstream media made mistakes with my quotes all over the news last
[2:34:16.400 --> 2:34:19.120]  week because the secret service took notice and went and said yeah we
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:22.000]  we didn't even know about some of those clips on the news because it's big
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:25.600]  official people in public saying it like mud and others
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:30.480]  and brennan and clapper so folks are folks are really
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:33.440]  arrogant out there pushing this whole narrative
[2:34:33.440 --> 2:34:37.200]  now max keiser is a hard man to get on but he just landed
[2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:40.800]  in new york from wherever he's he's been to globetrotting
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:45.440]  he's one of the first people to promote cryptocurrencies and to promote bitcoin
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:48.800]  and i wish to heaven what was it five six years ago when he told me you got to
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:52.240]  get on a bitcoin that i'd listen to this man i'd never gotten into it because
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:55.120]  i'm busy in news and information i own no stocks
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:34:58.320]  i'm i just that's not what i do i'm just here with news and info
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:01.200]  because if i got into stocks and stuff i'd get obsessed with it whatever i
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:03.760]  work on i get obsessed with i've got everything about it
[2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:06.640]  you know i start watching sports that's all i do i mean i just saw it that's why
[2:35:06.640 --> 2:35:10.160]  i can't watch sports it's just news news news in my family that's it
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:13.440]  uh but man cryptocurrency market now worth more than
[2:35:13.440 --> 2:35:20.240]  jp morgan three hundred and seventy billion dollars and growing exponentially
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:23.680]  and i know it's it's real because it's at least something citizens have
[2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:27.120]  versus what the globalist have which is their own fiat money but then they just
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:30.240]  get to use it so central banks move on over i thought they'd
[2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:33.120]  shut it down but i guess they just couldn't stop it
[2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:37.280]  but bitcoin has gained four thousand in just two days
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:40.800]  sixteen thousand per bitcoin if i'd have bought
[2:35:40.800 --> 2:35:43.920]  bitcoin back when i first learned about it when nobody knew about it was just
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:48.240]  first hearing about max keiser i mean i could have invested a hundred thousand
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:51.440]  dollars and i'd have i'd have fifty million
[2:35:51.440 --> 2:35:54.560]  dollars i mean break this down for us this is just
[2:35:54.560 --> 2:35:58.720]  astonishing cnbc it's now the biggest thing in the world
[2:35:58.720 --> 2:36:02.720]  just cryptocurrencies alone is bigger than jp morgan
[2:36:02.720 --> 2:36:06.240]  what in the world is going on max keiser
[2:36:06.240 --> 2:36:10.480]  south con uh good my friend i mean i know you're in the airport but wow you
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:13.680]  you you told i first heard about bitcoin from you give me the history
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:18.720]  how many years ago was that yeah i was uh three dollars a coin back then and
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:23.280]  we suggested that this could do the work that our crash jp morgan by silver
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:26.800]  campaign was trying to do and that is to decapitalize the big bank
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:30.000]  i forgot word for word you said it was to get bigger than them
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:34.640]  you are like a profit yeah yeah pretty much because
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:38.880]  we needed a way to introduce money that they couldn't control and they couldn't
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:41.520]  manipulate and bitcoin is that money now they're all
[2:36:41.520 --> 2:36:45.200]  scrambling to get involved and the price is going to go a lot higher and this is
[2:36:45.200 --> 2:36:47.920]  the currency of the revolution this is the currency of the global
[2:36:47.920 --> 2:36:52.320]  insurrection against banker occupation bitcoin is the real thing alec
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:36:56.480]  i know it's real i just if i couldn't a hundred percent guarantee it was safe i
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:36:59.040]  couldn't i i agreed get it listeners if you think
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:02.320]  i had you on i've been a promoter of it just saying look out
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:05.920]  because you know i thought they'd shoot down the the lead elephant they haven't
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:08.880]  it looks like they're going to capitulate to it and like you said it may
[2:37:08.880 --> 2:37:13.760]  become the new global currency well they will capitulate to it as far as
[2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:18.240]  it being a global currency that's a loaded uh term i don't mean i don't mean
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:21.920]  politically with globalist running and i mean the people's global currency
[2:37:21.920 --> 2:37:25.920]  will be cryptocurrency in general the people's currency is definitely going
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:30.480]  to be cryptocurrency and the fiat money world is collapsing there's
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:34.000]  about 300 trillion dollars worth of debt in the world
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:37.200]  and all of that debt is going to collapse it's already collapsing fiat
[2:37:37.200 --> 2:37:41.280]  money is collapsing what's beautiful about bitcoin right now is there's a
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:45.280]  couple of concepts i want to tell you about one is called hyper bitcoinization
[2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:49.840]  and the other is called the bitcoin black hole so the bitcoin black hole
[2:37:49.840 --> 2:37:54.640]  is when bitcoin sucks in all the other fiat money from all the other
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:57.840]  exchanges and different fiat money in different currencies we see that
[2:37:57.840 --> 2:38:01.200]  happening right now and then hyper bitcoinization is when
[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:04.960]  bitcoin becomes a unit of account so everything at your store is priced in
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:08.320]  bitcoin people are paid in bitcoin people saving their bitcoin
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:12.480]  it becomes the de facto currency to go to currency that's what people want
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:17.200]  there's an old law in economics called fairer's law and it's talking about
[2:38:17.200 --> 2:38:20.560]  good money pushing out bad and we're seeing that happen on an epic global
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:24.240]  scale right now good money is pushing out the bad fiat money
[2:38:24.240 --> 2:38:27.920]  and anyone who owns it everything that they buy constantly goes down in price
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:31.760]  because it's highly deflationary the amount of supply goes down by 50
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:35.120]  percent every four years whereas in the fiat money world the supply
[2:38:35.120 --> 2:38:38.640]  increases dramatically every month and what you say is key what you say is
[2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:41.920]  key because all the old global currencies have
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:45.200]  got bad mortgages and scams and and derivatives
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:50.320]  infecting them and are all connected to bad assets when bitcoin is just
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:54.000]  people's confidence and its basic technology
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  it is the next level so it's better than the old fiat currency
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.040]  because that's what i kind of saw it as is a new fiat
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:04.080]  and it's being proven so but not just bitcoin i know that's
[2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:06.480]  you've created some other cryptocurrencies not just been one of the
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:09.920]  main launchers of bitcoin so let's expand on that where you think it's
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:14.160]  going and then who will be dominant in the new cryptocurrency system and can
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:18.240]  the empire strike back can they try to shut it down i think it's too late
[2:39:18.240 --> 2:39:24.240]  well the the idea of bitcoin being something that is outside of regulation
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:27.840]  and people are trying to regulate it and it's not regulated as false
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:31.680]  bitcoin is regulated by the bitcoin protocol it's regulated by software
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:36.000]  that's what i mean it's it's that's its value is that it's self-regulating
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:39.680]  it is it too well it's it there's a core development team
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:42.640]  that is maintaining the bitcoin network then you have the miners then you have
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:45.280]  the merchants and you have the people who are buying and holding or
[2:39:45.280 --> 2:39:49.040]  hotling as it's called and all these things work together in a very beautiful
[2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:54.000]  symmetry to create a parallel economy okay six months ago i was sold on it
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:57.120]  finally you know late to the game i asked you to come to us you said oh yes
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:40:00.960]  i'll be there in three weeks to help me help me invest help the audience and
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:05.840]  then you're just too powerful you won't come well it's just i mean the best thing
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:09.120]  you can do is just buy bitcoin and wait just buy and hold i don't know who to
[2:40:09.120 --> 2:40:11.440]  get it from or what to do and then and then
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:15.600]  some bitcoin and others just got raided not raided they just had hackers steal
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:18.160]  65 million i mean i want to know if i'm going to get
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:21.680]  into it kaiser i need to talk to one of the bitcoin wizards
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:25.120]  look there's a couple of uh misinformation out there this
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:28.160]  let me tell you if you want to buy bitcoin right now the people
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:31.360]  they're going to i'm asking you where do i buy the bitcoin
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:36.800]  think at coinbase.com okay i believe you i'm gonna okay now as far as the
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:40.000]  problems that you're talking about the exchanges where people
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:44.800]  trade bitcoin they are occasionally hacked and they occasionally have problems
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:48.960]  but that's uh that's nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol itself the core
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:52.560]  value of bitcoin it's not it's it's not the currency itself it's it's the
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:59.840]  money that people made off of it okay yeah i'm actually uh
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:03.440]  i'm heading to wall street right now i'm on wall street there's uh the police

[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:37.680]  attention now well if you put even two or three hundred dollars back at
[2:41:37.680 --> 2:41:40.880]  bitcoin at that time it would be worth almost two million dollars today
[2:41:40.880 --> 2:41:44.160]  oh my god you told me you said and you told me in
[2:41:44.160 --> 2:41:48.880]  london again four years ago you said alex alex at dinner and we hung up for

[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:57.680]  let's do this you know i was living in london i gave russell brand a thousand
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:42:02.080]  bitcoin as a gift when it was still in the two or three dollar range i don't
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:05.120]  know what he did with it i think he lost it but it's not worth 18 million
[2:42:05.120 --> 2:42:09.440]  dollars you gave him 18 million i wish you
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:13.200]  to give that to me i gave away so many bitcoin during
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:16.560]  those days when i was training for a buck i'd say here i remember you even

[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:24.560]  like i think i i gave george galloway a free coin i gave i tried to give you
[2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:28.080]  free coin i'm trying to get i've given away probably two or three thousand
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:30.720]  coins over the over the during the early years

[2:46:55.920 --> 2:47:10.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:13.280]  all right folks max geysers walk around the wall street about to go an important
[2:47:13.280 --> 2:47:16.800]  meeting just landed an hour and a half ago there in new york i'm trying to get
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:19.040]  him on via skype the next few days we're going to fly down here to austin
[2:47:19.040 --> 2:47:22.160]  because look i know about financial markets i study
[2:47:22.160 --> 2:47:24.880]  things but if i invest in them then i get obsessed with it
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:27.760]  i did this about 15 years ago i did some investing i did pretty good at it
[2:47:27.760 --> 2:47:30.400]  but then i want to know everything about it and it just takes over my time i
[2:47:30.400 --> 2:47:34.000]  want to be focused on news but bitcoin he said it's going to be
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:37.360]  revolutionary it'll be bigger than jp morgan it's going to take over
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:41.200]  and it just all came true and i remember him trying to give me bitcoin
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:44.320]  remember him giving russell brand bitcoin even though it had already
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:46.960]  gone up so i just sit back and think about how
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:49.840]  revolutionary this is against the globalists they may still pull something
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:52.880]  there's a bunch of other ones we have guests on about other ones they go up
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:57.920]  24% one day the one that uh macafe was pushing here
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:01.440]  and so i see everybody even on my own show promoting it and exploding and i'm
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:04.800]  like wow this could really help finance the operation against the globalists
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:08.000]  and i know eric prince has invested in a lot of other big wigs think it's the
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:12.240]  future but not just bitcoin it was the first tell us max keiser what else is
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:16.720]  coming what other good ones are uh what you expect we've seen
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:20.480]  crashes but it only gets bigger after i mean why does it seem invincible
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:23.920]  in the six years since its birth
[2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:31.680]  we just lost him on a cell phone max keiser drives me crazy
[2:48:31.680 --> 2:48:34.800]  he calls up must be need to go to like brazil whether they make a film or go to
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:38.240]  london and then i want to give him all about politics and he goes i want to
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:42.000]  talk about bitcoin i want to talk about crashing jp morgan
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:45.920]  and so he said he'd be on with us and now he's gone we call him back
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:50.080]  i love that what i'm like let's go to the congresswoman now
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:54.080]  i'm like it's like the millennium falcon when i watch this we're going to
[2:48:54.080 --> 2:49:01.040]  hyperspace nothing happens anyways i just don't want to be part
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:08.560]  of a tulip hysteria what was that 500 years ago
[2:49:08.560 --> 2:49:11.280]  did he think i wasn't going back to him you got to let him know we're going
[2:49:11.280 --> 2:49:15.200]  back to him they had that thing you know going on in europe
[2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:18.400]  when it started like in the netherlands and they were changing tulips his money
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:21.440]  and then it went up in like a month millions of times and then it all
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:24.800]  plunged so that's why i made the decision
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:29.120]  five six years ago hell it was more than five years ago he was promoting
[2:49:29.120 --> 2:49:32.640]  use it like silver to crash jp morgan five years ago it was longer than that
[2:49:32.640 --> 2:49:36.080]  when he it was four five years ago he predicted it would become bigger than
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:38.560]  jp morgan
[2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:43.360]  and then it was a year or so before that i guess the whole thing got launched and
[2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:45.760]  he's been intimately involved with the folks that have been involved in it from
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:48.960]  the very very beginning this is very intriguing so i'm now
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:52.640]  extremely intrigued by this you know he did get surrounded by police and was the
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:55.200]  middle of some type of demonstration so maybe
[2:49:55.200 --> 2:49:58.400]  something happened because he knew he was still on right
[2:49:58.400 --> 2:50:02.160]  okay well then it's his cell phone died or something well let's just stay on
[2:50:02.160 --> 2:50:06.320]  him and i want him on tomorrow uh wow that was
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:09.840]  amazing you know the biggest thing we can invest in is freedom
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:12.960]  and the biggest thing we can invest in is is getting politically involved in
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:16.720]  being informed and having a passion purpose driven life
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:21.600]  and americana and libertah and libertarianism and the renaissance
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:25.440]  and the enlightenment is what creates incredible freedom the problem is you
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:28.800]  got to challenge your children you got to challenge yourself you got to
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:31.520]  challenge your husband you got to challenge your wife because once we
[2:50:31.520 --> 2:50:35.120]  produce all this success and wealth we tend to get decadent and then corruption
[2:50:35.120 --> 2:50:42.960]  sets in and so that's the paradox but uh
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:47.760]  since i mentioned it imagine how much money he got it on the ground floor
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:50.720]  he was giving away
[2:50:51.040 --> 2:50:54.320]  thousands of bitcoins all the time tried to give me some and i he was like
[2:50:54.320 --> 2:50:57.440]  give me the laptop i remember in london we're at dinner
[2:50:57.440 --> 2:51:00.800]  and he's like laptop is your laptop's not he's like me
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:04.880]  i'm trying out was he trying to give me the i remember that now
[2:51:04.880 --> 2:51:08.560]  just like he gave russell brand 18 million dollars worth
[2:51:08.560 --> 2:51:11.120]  and the word is russell brand doesn't even know what he did with it i'm kind
[2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:15.040]  of the same way i mean i can be technical if i need to be i'll learn
[2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:18.640]  how something works but there's so much stuff i just i'm not technical i can
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:21.440]  be technical i'm not technical so it's kind of like what
[2:51:21.440 --> 2:51:26.320]  you know fairy dust over here but that's how all the money is it's all fiat
[2:51:26.320 --> 2:51:29.520]  by the way i want to keep cash and gold around and silver around
[2:51:29.520 --> 2:51:33.760]  just like land or just like patents or ideas and that's value
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:38.000]  and again the real problem with the bitcoin from my research
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:41.360]  is that it's it's it's people holding them online
[2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:45.360]  that the exchanges that get hacked and they get stolen you've got to have them
[2:51:45.360 --> 2:51:49.360]  hardwired outside the web you've got to have it
[2:51:49.360 --> 2:51:53.520]  what's the term they use in intelligence shuttered or cut off
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:57.440]  you've got to have it on a hard drive you got to have it on a memory stick
[2:51:57.440 --> 2:52:01.520]  cold storage that is not plugged into anything
[2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:05.200]  and hackers can even get into like hard drives that have these capacitors in them
[2:52:05.200 --> 2:52:08.880]  so the government can energize them with with with waves and then turn on a
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:12.560]  capacitor that has enough power to then blark transmit it
[2:52:12.560 --> 2:52:16.960]  onto the onto the phone lines or digital lines or even power lines
[2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:21.520]  can be used to oscillate power chips see i say i'm not technical but then i know
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:24.400]  all the spying stuff i just read the spying stuff i don't really
[2:52:24.400 --> 2:52:27.120]  get all the technicals but i just know how it works they have chips in all the
[2:52:27.120 --> 2:52:30.240]  major products that they can remotely even if you're in cold
[2:52:30.240 --> 2:52:32.400]  storage or not plugged into the internet
[2:52:32.400 --> 2:52:37.600]  they can then power up the the the chips that have transmission capacitors
[2:52:37.600 --> 2:52:41.920]  that then if they're transceivers they receive and transmit
[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:44.960]  built into your computer just like black boxes in your car they can taxi by the
[2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:48.640]  mile that all cars have now and then suddenly oh all cars are self-driving
[2:52:48.640 --> 2:52:53.920]  they all have the computer program in your car you're paying for that
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:52:58.640]  but then only the luxury cars first come out with it then all the idiots with
[2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:01.760]  you know alleys and Mercedes or whatever next year

[3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:31.600]  little exchange by jim jordan pushes fbi on ties between
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:35.920]  the fbi clinton operatives and the trump surveillance here it is
[3:00:35.920 --> 3:00:39.120]  there's been all kinds of story political facts reported 96 percent of the top
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:43.120]  lawyers uh contributions went to clinton or obama
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:46.800]  but peter struck the guy who ran the clinton investigation interviewed mills
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:49.600]  avidine interviewed secretary clinton changed gross
[3:00:49.600 --> 3:00:52.640]  negligence a crime to the term extreme carelessness
[3:00:52.640 --> 3:00:56.000]  who ran the russian investigation who interviewed mike flinn
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.200]  gets put on moeller's team and then he gets kicked off
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:03.920]  for a text message that's anti-trump
[3:01:04.640 --> 3:01:07.360]  if he kicked everybody off moeller's team it was anti-trump i don't think
[3:01:07.360 --> 3:01:11.120]  there'd be anybody left so here here there's got to be
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:15.120]  something more here it can't just be some text messages
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:19.920]  that show a pro-clinton anti-trump bias there's got to be something more
[3:01:19.920 --> 3:01:23.440]  and i'm trying to figure out what it is but my hunch is
[3:01:23.440 --> 3:01:27.600]  it has something to do with the dossier bb bb bb director did
[3:01:27.600 --> 3:01:32.640]  peter struck bb bb helped produce and present the application
[3:01:32.640 --> 3:01:37.840]  to defy the court bb to secure a warrant to spy on americans associated
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:42.000]  with the trump campaign bb bb congressman i'm not prepared to discuss
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:45.600]  anything about a fiza process and this is not a
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:48.000]  we're not talking about what happened in the court we're talking about what the
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:52.640]  fbi in his pants right now the application did peter struck
[3:01:52.640 --> 3:01:56.640]  was he involved in taking that to the court i'm not going to discuss
[3:01:56.640 --> 3:02:00.560]  in this setting anything to do with the fiza court applications well let's
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:03.440]  let's remember a couple things director and i know you know this we've
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:06.000]  we've all been made aware of this in the last few weeks let's remember a
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:09.840]  couple things about the dossier the democrat national committee in the
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:13.520]  clinton camp paid which we now know we're one in the same
[3:02:13.520 --> 3:02:19.760]  paid the law firm who paid fusion gps who paid christopher steele
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:25.760]  who then paid russians to put together a report that we call a dossier full of
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:30.400]  all kinds of fake news national inquire garbage
[3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:36.880]  and it's been reported that this dossier was all dressed up by the fbi
[3:02:36.880 --> 3:02:42.400]  taken to the fiza court and presented as a legitimate intelligence document
[3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:48.160]  that it became the basis for granting a warrant to spy on americans
[3:02:48.160 --> 3:02:51.680]  and i'm wondering i'm wondering if that actually took place it sure looks like
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.720]  it did this is solid gold and the easiest way to
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:02:57.520]  clear it up is for you guys to tell us what was in that application
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:03:03.040]  you're all screwed congressman our staffs have been having extensive
[3:03:03.040 --> 3:03:06.000]  interaction with both intelligence committees on our interaction with
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.200]  the court and i think that's the appropriate setting for those questions
[3:03:09.200 --> 3:03:13.280]  here's what i think director red they're all going to jail i think peter struck
[3:03:13.280 --> 3:03:16.480]  head of counterintelligence at the fbi long remember
[3:03:16.480 --> 3:03:20.480]  peter struck the guy who ran the clinton investigation
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:23.760]  did all the interviews peter struck the guy who was
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:28.080]  running the russian investigation at the fbi peter struck
[3:03:28.080 --> 3:03:32.160]  mr super agent at the fbi i think he's the guy
[3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:35.920]  who took the application to the fiza court and if that happened i mean
[3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:40.000]  think if this happens of course he did if you had the fbi
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:44.560]  working with a campaign the democrats campaign
[3:03:44.560 --> 3:03:48.640]  take an opposition research dressing it all up and turn it into an intelligence
[3:03:48.640 --> 3:03:52.400]  document and taking it to the fiza court so they can spy on the other campaign
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:57.440]  if that happened that is as wrong as it gets and you know what
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:04:00.720]  maybe i'm wrong you can clear it all up you can clear it all up for all of us
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:03.760]  here all the congressman wants to know and frankly all of america wants to know
[3:04:03.760 --> 3:04:06.880]  you can clear it all up by release we sent you a letter two days ago just
[3:04:06.880 --> 3:04:10.320]  release the application tell us what was in it tell us if i'm wrong
[3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:14.480]  but i don't think i am i think that's exactly what happened and if it did it
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:21.120]  is as wrong as it can be and people who did that need to be held accountable
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:24.320]  congressman we will not hesitate to hold people accountable
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:28.640]  after there has been an appropriate investigation independent and objective
[3:04:28.640 --> 3:04:32.480]  by the inspector general into the handling of the prior matter and based on
[3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:36.480]  that i will look at all available remedies that's the video that puts the
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:39.600]  final nails of the coffin the democrats are all turning against themselves
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:42.160]  right now they're burning down a front everybody
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:45.280]  it's all a giant fraud they're the ones in bed with the russians
[3:04:45.280 --> 3:04:53.200]  mueller all of them tell me the clinton's they are a joke and they went too far

[3:06:26.880 --> 3:06:31.360]  before uh my little portion of the program starts and listening to alex
[3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:38.800]  just the the the pleasure and happiness uh that i share with alex uh because of
[3:06:38.800 --> 3:06:42.960]  what's happening what we're seeing happening to uh the left
[3:06:42.960 --> 3:06:49.360]  their um one plus year temper tantrum continues
[3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:55.440]  and i don't know anybody who with an ounce of common sense in this country
[3:06:55.440 --> 3:07:00.080]  that isn't enjoying enjoying the temper tantrum
[3:07:00.080 --> 3:07:05.040]  and then watching the fallout from it how a lot of people
[3:07:05.040 --> 3:07:11.040]  again people with common sense were uh labeled horrible things over the past
[3:07:11.040 --> 3:07:13.920]  over a year well over a year and then eight years during the obama
[3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:16.960]  administration uh we've been labeled uh every kind of
[3:07:16.960 --> 3:07:21.520]  is an ism uh that that they could pull out
[3:07:21.520 --> 3:07:27.120]  and when it became unaffected or ineffective when uh people would call
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:31.520]  you these things and uh we all finally turned around and said
[3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:35.920]  who cares i don't care what you call me anymore
[3:07:35.920 --> 3:07:41.200]  i believe in this this is my position i support this
[3:07:41.200 --> 3:07:46.880]  uh they started going oh they're not getting upset with us anymore
[3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:50.800]  like a child trying to get attention from a parent
[3:07:50.800 --> 3:07:53.680]  and i think i don't mean to interrupt you while you're riffing here because i'm
[3:07:53.680 --> 3:07:57.200]  just here watching you but i'm gonna get at it right now but i'm gonna say this
[3:07:57.200 --> 3:08:01.440]  exactly and you know they've reached peak tantrum when obama came out and said
[3:08:01.440 --> 3:08:04.720]  trump is hitler and is going to commit a genocide
[3:08:04.720 --> 3:08:07.840]  but that i mean he actually said this in front of a whole crowd of people
[3:08:07.840 --> 3:08:11.120]  trump is hitler and we're all going to be murdered by him
[3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:15.200]  uh i mean the you know now they've really reached peak
[3:08:15.200 --> 3:08:19.760]  temper tantrum when when now a former president has called the new president
[3:08:19.760 --> 3:08:24.320]  hitler and he's going to kill all of us go ahead
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:31.680]  could you imagine that is the the peak of of insanity and i really i i compare it
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:37.520]  to childlike behavior if you look at people that have have children or your
[3:08:37.520 --> 3:08:40.480]  own children there is a point where they want your
[3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:44.960]  attention they want something and when you deny it to them
[3:08:44.960 --> 3:08:49.120]  they will have what is called a temper tantrum and that's exactly what we're
[3:08:49.120 --> 3:08:53.360]  seeing we are seeing people acting like absolute
[3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:57.680]  children trying to get daddy's attention or mommy's attention
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:02.160]  and it is one of the saddest things to watch and we see this has been going on
[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:05.760]  for uh well ever since since the campaign and by the way my children never
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:09.600]  did this but i've read the psychology books it's writing on the walls with
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:13.360]  crap i mean obama yesterday crapped in his hand and
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:17.200]  began writing on the walls hitler and then then then you know what and then
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:19.760]  went in front of mommy and daddy and pissed all over himself i mean
[3:09:19.760 --> 3:09:22.320]  i'm sorry to say it but that's what he even in fact that didn't get their
[3:09:22.320 --> 3:09:27.440]  attention so obama shoved it in his mouth
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:31.920]  it's it's astounding to watch this happen and i
[3:09:31.920 --> 3:09:39.520]  i don't want to uh be so happy watching it but i can't help it because as i said
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:43.040]  uh we people like uh alex and myself have been
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:48.080]  uh uh relegated to these isms and oligies and whatever else they could
[3:09:48.080 --> 3:09:53.760]  pull out to try to uh make us appear uncaring and and insane
[3:09:53.760 --> 3:09:57.840]  and and intolerant and to see it turn around
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:02.480]  when when i saw the likes of al franken deliver what what was that even supposed
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:06.320]  to be an apology that there there was no remorse
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:10.320]  whatsoever which i'm fine with i don't like the idea that people can
[3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:13.760]  no mean i agree but but it's his party that made him be stampeded into this
[3:10:13.760 --> 3:10:16.640]  what about bayhart celebrating that flinn met with the russians during the
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:19.920]  campaign was it true and then her half hearted apology i mean
[3:10:19.920 --> 3:10:23.600]  they're just jokes i'm sorry i'm i'm turning it over to you my friend i'm
[3:10:23.600 --> 3:10:27.520]  watching but you're absolutely on target and we really should celebrate
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:31.120]  i i that's why i am and that's why i feel so happy
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:35.280]  about what we're seeing with the likes of al franken i mean when we watched him
[3:10:35.280 --> 3:10:39.200]  during a lot of these congressional hearings just with complete
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:44.000]  bs coming out of his face uh trying to just stoke
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:47.120]  uh some kind of an issue with people that
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:52.240]  had uh done nothing but their jobs and by the way not just call the president
[3:10:52.240 --> 3:10:55.440]  hitler while the economy comes back and everything but say he's gonna
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:11:01.840]  genocide us genocide alex hitler genocide well they
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:07.520]  have to do this because if they commented on what trump is actually doing
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:14.640]  with uh uh a a an amazing tax bill the uh unemployment rate going down gdp
[3:11:14.640 --> 3:11:18.080]  going up jobs coming back to this country things we
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:24.320]  haven't seen uh in years or ever happening uh to this country the faith
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:27.760]  that americans have i i hear that just more
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:32.560]  more christmas lights are up already this year because all businesses
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:35.840]  everything everything well i'm gonna get out of here and just keep watching but
[3:11:35.840 --> 3:11:39.920]  i gotta say this too i've got all these news articles
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:44.560]  uh where universities strive for christmas free campuses
[3:11:44.560 --> 3:11:48.960]  cnn and and then they're actually saying no it's banned so they're literally
[3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:54.000]  becoming the grinch here banning are are they gonna ban uh
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:12:00.640]  kwanzaa celebrations too or um any uh islamic celebrations it's this double
[3:12:00.640 --> 3:12:04.800]  standard again that uh if if you're uh straight
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:08.800]  if you're white if you're christian uh you are now the new
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:13.040]  like they say hitler you're literally i like literally literally hitler
[3:12:13.040 --> 3:12:16.800]  if you're traditionalist and here's the deal most of course so-called minorities
[3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:19.840]  i know who are the new but they don't care they're not even buying it
[3:12:19.840 --> 3:12:23.840]  it's mainly weird neurotic white people that are trying to force all this
[3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:27.360]  insanity that's what we're seeing and i don't
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:31.200]  know where it comes from we said years ago when they started dishing out these
[3:12:31.200 --> 3:12:34.480]  trophies these participation trophies we said
[3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:41.600]  it's gonna breed a new type of a person that cannot accept no for an answer
[3:12:41.600 --> 3:12:45.200]  can't accept losing some type of competition
[3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:48.160]  and we will see these little temper tantrums going on
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:53.760]  and any inkling they have of power will be abused to the um
[3:12:53.760 --> 3:12:57.120]  10th level where uh you see on these college campuses
[3:12:57.120 --> 3:13:01.120]  they're saying they don't want christmas they don't want things like um
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:05.040]  like it's okay to be white which you know where you can interpret that
[3:13:05.040 --> 3:13:07.920]  whatever you want total control of every level of civilization
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:11.920]  they're a cult they want language control i mean yeah i mean i can't stand
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:15.920]  ultra super right-wing churches that pull that crap you know i love jesus i'm
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:18.720]  a christian but i walk out of a store and some guy's screaming and yelling
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:20.960]  you're going to hell you're you know you're with that
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:24.000]  woman is your wife i mean they're annoying too the difference is they're
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:28.480]  not running all the schools they're not running my life this is a real cult
[3:13:28.480 --> 3:13:31.440]  yeah and we've we've seen it the indoctrination is going on on college
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:36.080]  campuses the idea that free speech is something that they can pick and
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:39.360]  choose if they just have to label something hate speech
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:43.520]  which are above the criteria for that is whatever they want to come up with on
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:47.280]  the left is hate speech and they say that that isn't protected and
[3:13:47.280 --> 3:13:51.280]  they have no right to speak on these campuses and they honestly believe it
[3:13:51.280 --> 3:13:54.560]  i've never seen such an uneducated group of people
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:59.120]  as far as our constitutional amendments go uh speak about these things
[3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:02.720]  with complete ignorance let me ask you this complete confidence you're about
[3:14:02.720 --> 3:14:06.720]  to go to break and take over again folks compound media

[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:13.840]  this question just in one minute where does it go now though past insane
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:18.640]  temper tantrum i mean if obama has gone to writing in his own feces on the wall
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:21.760]  saying that you know that trumps hitler wants to kill everybody
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:24.800]  then i mean what's the next level after that
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:28.960]  i don't know how much further they can go before the sane rational people in
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:32.080]  this country really start making some noise about this
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:36.720]  i think as the country goes forward and we see trump doing such an amazing job
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:40.400]  bringing some of this tradition that made this country great
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:43.280]  back again we're going to see more people come on board

[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:34.240]  actually uh are the amazing people the amazing
[3:22:34.240 --> 3:22:42.400]  generation that uh uh answered the call these are people that
[3:22:42.400 --> 3:22:50.560]  were standing on lines to to sign up to get into some
[3:22:50.560 --> 3:22:54.960]  some part of the american military machine to do their part
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:23:03.920]  and fight for freedom um and against tyranny uh in this world
[3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:08.160]  and they they are often brought up in conversation
[3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:12.720]  uh people that had relatives and friends
[3:23:12.720 --> 3:23:15.840]  from the greatest generation that fought in that um
[3:23:15.840 --> 3:23:23.600]  unbelievable conflict um so long ago they they are often brought up
[3:23:23.600 --> 3:23:27.520]  in conversation what would my grandfather
[3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:32.400]  say what would my my grandfather fought for this
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:40.000]  or that and he would think this or that i have to assume
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:45.200]  that everyone that was on uh let's just say the the uh
[3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:52.320]  uss arizona perhaps on uh on that fateful day 76 years ago
[3:23:52.320 --> 3:23:56.480]  was not fighting for transgender bathrooms
[3:23:56.480 --> 3:24:02.880]  i don't think they were fighting so men dressed as women
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:08.880]  could go into the the ladies room i honestly don't think that
[3:24:08.880 --> 3:24:12.800]  i don't think they were fighting so that uh
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:19.040]  some uh child some childlike behavior on a college campus
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:23.840]  was preventing free speech literal and figurative
[3:24:23.840 --> 3:24:28.320]  book burnings going on on on campuses i don't think they'd have appreciated
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:33.120]  that honestly i don't think uh they would have
[3:24:33.120 --> 3:24:36.960]  appreciated a lot of these accusations going on
[3:24:36.960 --> 3:24:41.520]  i'm not talking sexual assault i'm not talking that
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:46.960]  i'm talking about maybe hanging a pinup uh where you work
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:52.400]  i'm talking about complimenting a girl uh these type of things these uh
[3:24:52.400 --> 3:24:57.360]  traditional practices of american men from the
[3:24:57.360 --> 3:25:01.520]  greatest generation as they were called
[3:25:02.880 --> 3:25:08.480]  you know we talk about them as heroes uh you look at a lot of that military
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:12.960]  equipment especially bomber aircraft look at the nose of
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:19.120]  those planes most of them were adorned with scantily
[3:25:19.120 --> 3:25:24.160]  clad women painted on the nose with highly suggestive titles
[3:25:24.160 --> 3:25:32.240]  for the names of their airplanes in today's society these men these heroes
[3:25:32.240 --> 3:25:35.280]  flying missions where many did not come back
[3:25:35.280 --> 3:25:42.560]  would be called horrible people yellow rose yellow rosa texas there she is
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:49.600]  with her little bippy top her little shorts that uh those men climbed into
[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:53.840]  these machines uh with a great possibility that
[3:25:53.840 --> 3:25:57.680]  they were not coming back and and painted these things these
[3:25:57.680 --> 3:26:03.200]  were parts of american tradition that would be looked at now
[3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:07.840]  as abominations and as sexist and and everything
[3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:15.200]  heavenly body there she is you think uh george uh will it uh
[3:26:15.200 --> 3:26:19.120]  mr what do they call him crafty you think he
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:24.560]  he would uh be tolerant to somebody spray painting over that maybe
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:28.960]  maybe he's just ready to take off and go on a bombing mission over dresden
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:33.440]  or something and some some uh a liberal walks up and goes
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:44.400]  no and spray paints over his nose art that's wrong man
[3:26:44.400 --> 3:26:48.240]  so anytime you bring up any of these amazing
[3:26:48.240 --> 3:26:56.560]  men who fought the f bomb that's clever uh bring up any of these amazing men
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:26:59.760]  that fought uh in this amazing conflict that we were
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:05.520]  brought into 76 years ago today uh let's not forget wow that guy's good
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:10.080]  huh that's an amazing little painting nice stems
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:15.840]  nice stems on that dame uh any anytime you bring that up just
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:20.720]  remember uh don't try to imagine what they would or
[3:27:20.720 --> 3:27:25.840]  wouldn't be fighting for today because i would have to assume
[3:27:25.840 --> 3:27:31.600]  and again i don't know but based on what i know and and the knowledge i have of
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:34.960]  that generation and what they were fighting for
[3:27:34.960 --> 3:27:41.680]  at the time i think american traditionalism uh and greatness
[3:27:41.680 --> 3:27:49.280]  a commonality of patriotism nationalism and freedom
[3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:54.000]  that's i think that's probably what got those guys
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:57.760]  to squeeze their asses into that narrow plane
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:02.160]  uh knowing there was a great chance they would not be coming back
[3:28:02.160 --> 3:28:07.760]  again not so some guy named bob can put a wig on
[3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:14.880]  and peace sitting down uh in in a public bathroom i don't know any
[3:28:14.880 --> 3:28:20.320]  of those men uh from interviews i've seen in documentaries
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:24.880]  that ran out of that amphibious vehicle or that landing craft
[3:28:24.880 --> 3:28:36.880]  onto a beach uh in france saying yes also bob can put on a wig
[3:28:36.880 --> 3:28:41.200]  and urinate next to women in a bathroom

[3:33:41.040 --> 3:33:46.160]  world war two um on this anniversary 76th anniversary
[3:33:46.160 --> 3:33:51.840]  of the bombing of pearl harbor by the japanese uh and look we're all getting

[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:05.920]  yeah they're just uh an amazing time in history
[3:34:05.920 --> 3:34:13.680]  the the sacrifice and commitment by uh the the american people to
[3:34:13.680 --> 3:34:19.520]  to fight tyranny that was you know an ocean away on either side of us
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:25.200]  but uh you know we we knew we knew what a good cause was
[3:34:25.200 --> 3:34:29.440]  we knew right from wrong and good from bad and uh it was um
[3:34:29.440 --> 3:34:32.720]  it was a lot clearer back then than it is now
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:38.640]  a travesty of justice happened last week in san francisco
[3:34:38.640 --> 3:34:45.600]  the garcia zarate case of course um kate steinald
[3:34:45.600 --> 3:34:49.760]  murdered i don't care what the verdict was that uh
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:56.800]  she was murdered um in san francisco and he got off
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:00.720]  pretty much with a slap on the wrist uh at that trial hopefully a
[3:35:00.720 --> 3:35:05.200]  federal trial will uh turn out a little differently
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:09.120]  this is a guy that was deported five times um
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:13.040]  he was in the uh city of san francisco
[3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:21.040]  a sanctuary city where they feel that the laws of the land don't apply to them
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:26.080]  that somebody breaking the law can just go about their business and continue
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:32.880]  breaking that law uh with impunity and uh the end
[3:35:32.880 --> 3:35:37.520]  of that whole thing and ended up with a beautiful woman
[3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:45.280]  a contributing member of society being murdered by this guy
[3:35:45.280 --> 3:35:51.200]  as if that wasn't bad enough he's put on trial through this uh
[3:35:51.200 --> 3:35:56.160]  justice system that is supposed to work in this country
[3:35:56.160 --> 3:36:02.640]  and they do not find him guilty of murder or manslaughter amazing he
[3:36:02.640 --> 3:36:07.440]  he picked up a gun uh a a gun that was stolen
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:14.880]  he picked up a stolen gun uh his actions were responsible for that gun
[3:36:14.880 --> 3:36:23.040]  going off and shooting that woman k and uh he goes to to trial
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:26.960]  in san francisco and they do not find him guilty
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:32.800]  of murder or manslaughter uh and this brings up
[3:36:32.800 --> 3:36:36.560]  another huge problem we are having with 2017
[3:36:36.560 --> 3:36:40.560]  united states of america we've heard this for years a
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:45.520]  jury of our peers when you are committing uh when you've committed
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:49.920]  a crime you're charged with a crime you are entitled to a trial
[3:36:49.920 --> 3:36:58.320]  in front of a jury of your peers now first of all this guy is an illegal
[3:36:58.320 --> 3:37:03.440]  alien who are his peers should we just go down and pluck some
[3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:08.720]  people out of mexico and have them sit in judgment of this man
[3:37:08.720 --> 3:37:14.080]  no a jury of our peers are supposed to be this was what it was supposed to be
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:17.840]  and what it was for many years and what it turned into
[3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:21.760]  uh something completely different a jury of our peers our people
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:29.200]  it doesn't mean white or black or of of certain ethnic backgrounds or
[3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:34.560]  places what it is is there's a commonality there
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:39.200]  the your your peers ship with these people are the fact that we are
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:46.640]  americans we have a common thread of a country culture
[3:37:46.640 --> 3:37:52.880]  language tradition values we know what what is
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:38:01.600]  innately good and bad right and wrong we have a a a want to make things
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:09.280]  better uh and we want the laws of this land enforced
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:16.560]  fairly and we want justice administered that's what the peers ship
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:22.240]  is supposed to be in those 12 people sitting in judgment
[3:38:22.240 --> 3:38:30.880]  of the person on a trial this doesn't exist anymore
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:36.800]  when you fill up a jury box when lawyers pick a jury
[3:38:36.800 --> 3:38:45.280]  they are looking for people that have no concept of everything i just mentioned
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:53.600]  any type of united front uh where where you're a peer of the person on trial
[3:38:53.600 --> 3:39:01.680]  because of your common uh ethics and morality and value system
[3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:08.800]  based on being an american so how could these people possibly
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:14.960]  come up with a verdict that is fair and based on those things if they don't
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:19.200]  even believe in them if they're plucked from this
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:25.840]  city of san francisco which believes in something like a sanctuary
[3:39:25.840 --> 3:39:30.480]  for criminals they actually have a belief system
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:35.040]  that if you're breaking the law we will not do anything about it
[3:39:35.040 --> 3:39:42.960]  because you vote democratic you'll raise kids that'll vote democratic
[3:39:42.960 --> 3:39:47.440]  uh i i even find it difficult to try to figure out why
[3:39:47.440 --> 3:39:51.920]  what's the motivation for this thing but it is true
[3:39:51.920 --> 3:39:56.720]  there is no common thread through the juries
[3:39:56.720 --> 3:40:01.120]  in the american judicial system anymore that leads them
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:04.480]  to a conclusion based on the facts that they heard
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:12.000]  that is fair and just it doesn't exist anymore and that is a scary
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:18.720]  scary uh prospect for anyone that is up on uh any type of charges
[3:40:18.720 --> 3:40:24.960]  not only if you're innocent if you are somebody that they deem
[3:40:24.960 --> 3:40:30.160]  a social pariah in san francisco which at this point is anyone
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:38.800]  who is perhaps white straight um uh successful if you're any one of uh
[3:40:38.800 --> 3:40:44.560]  those you already have a jury that probably is pitted against you
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:47.360]  so if you're innocent and have to go before a jury that
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:51.760]  isn't a jury of your peers uh there's a problem there
[3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:58.160]  and just like that if you're uh up on charges and you're you're guilty
[3:40:58.160 --> 3:41:02.960]  you're a criminal just for being in this country and you have a jury that is so
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:06.560]  sympathetic because they don't believe in the value system that
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:11.360]  we have in this country that's a scary prospect too
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:17.280]  uh i don't see where it ends uh hopefully with this
[3:41:17.280 --> 3:41:21.600]  momentum that we're getting uh that started with the election of donald
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:24.960]  trump it's it's funny to say and and i know some people say
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:28.320]  that and and people goof on him wow he's an idiot he's this that and the other
[3:41:28.320 --> 3:41:30.960]  thing regardless of what you think donald trump is
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:36.960]  he has turned uh this country um on its on its head
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:42.960]  peeling away the layers of bull that uh we have been living in
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:49.760]  exposing so much of the hypocrisy and uh outright criminality going on in the
[3:41:49.760 --> 3:41:54.720]  government and the mainstream media uh and hopefully
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:41:59.520]  that momentum will catch on and we will start seeing a change
[3:41:59.520 --> 3:42:05.280]  in uh certain areas like these sanctuary cities
[3:42:05.280 --> 3:42:08.800]  where is somebody supposed to get a fair trial
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:13.760]  when the jury box is loaded with people that don't share
[3:42:13.760 --> 3:42:19.120]  that that ideology and that that faith in the system
[3:42:19.120 --> 3:42:26.160]  there is literally uh a hatred of the very system that they're sitting in
[3:42:26.160 --> 3:42:31.200]  judgment uh on uh and i can only imagine having to
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:34.720]  turn around and look at a jury when you know they
[3:42:34.720 --> 3:42:40.560]  just have such disdain for the system in place that they are participating in
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:44.480]  scary prospect my friends uh we'll be back in a matter
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:49.120]  of moments don't go anywhere anthony comey in at info wars dot com

[3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:40.240]  um we are in a most insane crazy backwards
[3:48:40.240 --> 3:48:46.080]  bizarro world that in some of these stories that i read on a daily basis i
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:52.320]  am stunned even today i get stunned still uh i'm used to it
[3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:56.720]  i've seen lots of these stories but this is um
[3:48:56.720 --> 3:49:03.360]  pure insanity apparently in the great city of brotherly love which is just
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:07.680]  one of the greatest ironies i've ever ever heard in my life philadelphia
[3:49:07.680 --> 3:49:11.760]  pennsylvania some call it killadelfia
[3:49:11.760 --> 3:49:17.920]  uh a politician here city councilwoman cindy bass
[3:49:17.920 --> 3:49:26.240]  she is looking to remove bulletproof glass
[3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:30.240]  that you see in a lot of these convenience stores and liquor stores
[3:49:30.240 --> 3:49:35.360]  in uh urban areas you'll see a lot of these um
[3:49:35.360 --> 3:49:42.720]  people work with everything behind bulletproof glass now i'm silly
[3:49:42.720 --> 3:49:47.200]  i'm silly i would assume and maybe i'm wrong
[3:49:47.200 --> 3:49:52.800]  that you don't just all the sudden put bulletproof glass up in your business
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:58.160]  i go to a lot of stores uh place of business where i've never seen bullet
[3:49:58.160 --> 3:50:02.480]  proof glass i should ask the person why haven't you
[3:50:02.480 --> 3:50:06.720]  installed bulletproof glass here i'm assuming again maybe i'd get the answer
[3:50:06.720 --> 3:50:11.680]  we've never ever ever had somebody try to shoot us
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:14.640]  which would be reasonable why go through the cost of putting up the bulletproof
[3:50:14.640 --> 3:50:19.680]  glass but in killadelfia where armed robberies
[3:50:19.680 --> 3:50:25.040]  and assaults and murders are rampant some of these business owners have
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:30.160]  decided look i'm gonna put a barrier between myself
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:34.720]  and people who wish to kill me and uh they could
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:37.920]  give their money and i could give the merchandise through a little
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:41.360]  uh portal through this thing but i'll be safe
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:45.760]  from um the unbelievable violence that is happening in this
[3:50:45.760 --> 3:50:52.880]  city well cindy bass says right now the plexiglass
[3:50:52.880 --> 3:50:56.720]  has to come down she says she wants to put some
[3:50:56.720 --> 3:51:01.680]  controls on these small stores that from her point of view sell booze
[3:51:01.680 --> 3:51:08.080]  very little food and are a source of trouble for the district there she is
[3:51:08.080 --> 3:51:11.600]  uh we want to make sure that there isn't this sort of
[3:51:11.600 --> 3:51:18.080]  indignity in my opinion to serving food through a plexiglass only
[3:51:18.080 --> 3:51:21.840]  in certain neighborhoods
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:27.360]  the crazy bizarro backwards world of cindy bass
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:34.000]  dictates that it is degrading
[3:51:34.560 --> 3:51:42.560]  and um uh in somehow an indignity to want to protect your life and the
[3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:46.080]  lives of your workers and family that might be working at
[3:51:46.080 --> 3:51:50.480]  your store so instead of having the choice
[3:51:50.480 --> 3:51:54.320]  to defend yourself in the way that you deem fit
[3:51:54.320 --> 3:51:58.000]  and in this case would be bulletproof glass
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:02.800]  uh she's saying no through nothing more than political correctness
[3:52:02.800 --> 3:52:11.200]  she wants this removed uh there is a man rich kim rich kim he um
[3:52:11.200 --> 3:52:17.760]  resents the story um this uh this uh policy she wants to enact
[3:52:17.760 --> 3:52:21.440]  saying that uh the most important thing is safety
[3:52:21.440 --> 3:52:25.200]  and he says if the glass comes down the crime rate will rise and there will be
[3:52:25.200 --> 3:52:33.040]  a lot of dead bodies now honestly a lot of these stores are owned by
[3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:37.120]  koreans korean store owners and they have been
[3:52:37.120 --> 3:52:42.640]  the focus of a lot of abuse uh at the hands of the very community
[3:52:42.640 --> 3:52:46.880]  in which they are brave enough to bring business into
[3:52:46.880 --> 3:52:51.680]  it's either rich kim or you don't get your lottery tickets
[3:52:51.680 --> 3:52:56.800]  that's pretty much the bottom line in uh a lot of these inner city
[3:52:56.800 --> 3:53:01.840]  bodegas and stores uh like this these small stores
[3:53:01.840 --> 3:53:05.600]  kim's family's run a deli which sells a soda snacks meals beer
[3:53:05.600 --> 3:53:09.760]  for 20 years he said the glass went up after a shooting
[3:53:09.760 --> 3:53:12.960]  and claims it saved his mother-in-law from a knife attack
[3:53:12.960 --> 3:53:18.000]  now he may be forced to take the barriers down
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:25.440]  can anyone come up with a logical reason why
[3:53:25.440 --> 3:53:31.360]  you shouldn't have these things based on nothing more than political correctness
[3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:35.920]  and uh and uh politics this woman is trying to
[3:53:35.920 --> 3:53:40.320]  ingratiate herself with her uh constituency which i guess are made up of
[3:53:40.320 --> 3:53:43.520]  a lot of people that don't like the bulletproof glass
[3:53:43.520 --> 3:53:47.200]  i guess it cuts in on business if you're trying to rob a place and you walk in
[3:53:47.200 --> 3:53:50.080]  in this bulletproof glass it's just someone interfering with your
[3:53:50.080 --> 3:53:53.680]  livelihood this is interfering with people's jobs
[3:53:53.680 --> 3:53:57.920]  i'm a professional robber and i don't like this
[3:53:57.920 --> 3:54:01.920]  again uh liberals and democrats trying to keep
[3:54:01.920 --> 3:54:05.600]  you from defending yourself in the best way possible
[3:54:05.600 --> 3:54:11.440]  which brings me to uh this story which i love um they want to concealed carry
[3:54:11.440 --> 3:54:17.360]  reciprocity to reciprocate each state will reciprocate if you have a permit
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:21.760]  to carry a concealed weapon in the state of pennsylvania
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:24.800]  you should be able to drive over the border to new jersey
[3:54:24.800 --> 3:54:29.440]  and still have the ability to protect yourself with your concealed
[3:54:29.440 --> 3:54:34.560]  a handgun this has been something that has gone to states rights
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:38.400]  for many years um if you look at the second amendment
[3:54:38.400 --> 3:54:42.720]  these shall not be infringed is fairly clear
[3:54:42.720 --> 3:54:46.160]  shall not be infringed means shall not be infringed
[3:54:46.160 --> 3:54:50.720]  so uh they're looking to pass this the house passed it already
[3:54:50.720 --> 3:54:55.280]  it uh it goes to the senate and i really hope this passes
[3:54:55.280 --> 3:55:01.520]  this is key to american people being able to defend themselves no matter where
[3:55:01.520 --> 3:55:05.200]  they are if you go through all of the background checks
[3:55:05.200 --> 3:55:11.120]  and what have you that it takes to uh get a concealed carry in a state
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:13.680]  why shouldn't you be able to go to another state
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:18.640]  it's the constitution the the bill of rights the second amendment of the
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:22.480]  united states of america that allows you to bear arms
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:27.120]  a state's right should not be able to take away
[3:55:27.120 --> 3:55:32.000]  to take away your rights that are god given
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:36.880]  as a human being and in this country there it is
[3:55:36.880 --> 3:55:40.320]  the second amendment oh they always get on that militia part
[3:55:40.320 --> 3:55:45.040]  but it says a well-regulated militia yes comma being necessary
[3:55:45.040 --> 3:55:48.960]  to the security of a free state comma the right of the people
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:54.160]  to bear arms shall not be infringed because an armed populace are the only
[3:55:54.160 --> 3:55:58.320]  people that could form a well-regulated militia
[3:55:58.320 --> 3:56:00.960]  it doesn't say you need the militia to be armed
[3:56:00.960 --> 3:56:04.640]  obviously you need to be armed to form the militia
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:09.280]  that's what the the actual amendment uh dictates
[3:56:09.280 --> 3:56:13.680]  and the supreme court has agreed with that mind you
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:21.840]  but uh this is fantastic the ability for you as an american to protect yourself
[3:56:21.840 --> 3:56:25.520]  and your loved ones in the best possible way
[3:56:25.520 --> 3:56:30.480]  you want to now if you believe that that is a baseball bat next to your bed
[3:56:30.480 --> 3:56:36.400]  so be it no one's forcing you to arm yourself with a handgun
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:40.080]  but if you want to be on even footing with somebody that perhaps
[3:56:40.080 --> 3:56:44.720]  enters your house that's armed your car that is armed
[3:56:44.720 --> 3:56:48.720]  uh i don't know about you but i'd want to be on as equal of footing
[3:56:48.720 --> 3:56:53.440]  with that person as possible if you're a slight woman perhaps
[3:56:53.440 --> 3:56:57.920]  and a burly man comes in that obviously could subdue you
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:01.040]  with his physical strength don't you want something
[3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:05.120]  the ability the choice for yourself to make based
[3:57:05.120 --> 3:57:08.640]  on your constitutional rights to protect yourself
[3:57:08.640 --> 3:57:16.400]  why should a state some politician decide for you how best you should defend
[3:57:16.400 --> 3:57:20.880]  yourself and your loved ones absolutely unconstitutional
[3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:25.040]  so when i see a bill like this this is real
[3:57:25.040 --> 3:57:30.160]  meat and potatoes politics here and i i really love that this administration
[3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:35.680]  is pushing forward and giving americans back the rights that they are given
