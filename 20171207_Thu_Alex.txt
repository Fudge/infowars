[00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:18.209]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:31.953]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.953 --> 00:00:41.415]  Many times in history, big events take place politically and aren't recognized for what's actually happened at that point.
[00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:45.755]  Well, we're in one of those moments right now.
[00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:47.156]  I've looked at all the evidence.
[00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:48.617]  I've studied it.
[00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:51.358]  You've got all these Democrat senators and House members resigning.
[00:00:51.358 --> 00:00:55.120]  You've got all these Democrat mayors having to resign for pedophilia.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.881]  It's like 14 of them now.
[00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.262]  You've got Hollywood collapsing.
[00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:00.683]  The NFL collapsing.
[00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:02.784]  The EU collapsing.
[00:01:02.784 --> 00:01:08.127]  Socialist, globalist political parties collapsing all over the world on four different continents right now.
[00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:11.539]  Globalism is in free fall.
[00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:18.886]  And the FBI under Clinton control, trying to cover for all their crimes, thinking she'd be president, has blown up in their face.
[00:01:18.886 --> 00:01:24.031]  And the fact that they didn't know when to quit and pull this whole Russiagate thing is just incredible.
[00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:27.614]  It is absolutely eviscerating them.
[00:01:27.614 --> 00:01:30.817]  And John Bowne breaks it down in this report, busted.
[00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:34.361]  FBI Democrat could be the final straw that accelerates their collapse.
[00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.756]  It's your mother's FBI.
[00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:41.719]  What's wrong with the FBI is not the average everyday agent.
[00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:42.600]  They're great.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.642]  It's the management at the FBI that is the problem.
[00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:48.104]  Talk about the wolf guarding the hen house.
[00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:51.447]  Peter Strzok, FBI deputy and Russia expert.
[00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:52.427]  We're good to go.
[00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:12.433]  Strzok
[00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:32.293]  Yes.
[00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:55.378]  Invest- criminal investigation, and then they turn up the heat on this investigation of Flynn, the same agency.
[00:02:55.378 --> 00:02:56.619]  This is politics.
[00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.581]  The Bureau has been politicized.
[00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:10.149]  The Justice Department recently verified that Strzok had been exchanging emails insulting President Trump, and was engaging in an extramarital affair with Mueller's trial lawyer, Lisa Page.
[00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:17.875]  And that was enough controversy to have Strzok moved to a human resources desk, where Devin Nunes pestered Strzok for an interview.
[00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:27.560]  All we were doing was sending two of our investigators down there to start to begin to go through the documents to ensure that the documents that we had subpoenaed were provided.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:41.587]  When my investigators got there, there were four other staff from the other side of the aisle, including a member of Congress, the ranking member from our committee, which seems to me to be very bizarre behavior since they did not support... Adam Schiff was there.
[00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:42.848]  Adam Schiff was there.
[00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.189]  Two Nancy Pelosi staffers were there, correct?
[00:03:45.774 --> 00:03:48.539]  Yeah, so I think here's the bizarre part of it.
[00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:49.801]  They didn't support the subpoena.
[00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:52.265]  They said there was no reason to see this documentation.
[00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:55.531]  So, I don't know why they would run down there and be the first people to review it.
[00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:56.312]  What does that tell you?
[00:03:57.386 --> 00:04:00.148]  Well, it tells me that they're very, very nervous.
[00:04:00.148 --> 00:04:13.896]  Nunes told the Daily Caller, this is part of a months-long pattern by the DOJ and FBI of stonewalling and obstructing the committee's oversight work, particularly oversight of their use of the Steele dossier.
[00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:18.779]  Unfortunately, Strzok is just one of the Democrats fueling Mueller's witch hunt.
[00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:33.190]  The Daily Caller reports at least nine of Mueller's prosecutors have donated to Democratic political candidates, and all of the legal actions taken so far in Mueller's investigation have involved pro-Democrat prosecutors.
[00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:43.919]  The lawyers working the money laundering case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates have donated to Obama's presidential campaigns.
[00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.586]  Struck is the face of the infiltration of the deep state upon the federal government.
[00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:57.616]  A big clue revealing the hordes of Obama and Hillary Clinton loyalists working to undermine the highest office in the land.
[00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:59.359]  John Bowne reporting for Info.
[00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:00.460]  I'm so excited.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:10.666]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:16.170]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.192]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:27.978]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:35.362]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:05:35.362 --> 00:05:38.264]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:05:38.264 --> 00:05:49.650]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.331]  It is amazing!
[00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:57.314]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:06:06.256 --> 00:06:14.745]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:36.839]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.922]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:06:40.922 --> 00:06:43.143]  Thursday, the 7th day of December 2017.
[00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:47.666]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:56.452]  Remember, the globalists, the multinationals that are anti-free market have been trying to shut down free speech here in America and in Europe.
[00:06:56.452 --> 00:07:00.015]  They've been trying to adopt communist Chinese style systems of control.
[00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:13.586]  And they're trying to focus in on InfoWars and use us as the case point example because they know we are the most effective at alerting the population of the planet to their criminal operations.
[00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:21.328]  So when you share the local radio station you're listening to or the local TV station you're watching, when you spread links to InfoWars.com,
[00:07:22.248 --> 00:07:25.272]  And PrisonPlanet.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:07:25.272 --> 00:07:27.435]  It is a revolutionary act.
[00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:32.722]  When you spread the live links from InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:40.292]  When you share the links you're watching live on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or other platforms or restream them.
[00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:43.858]  And post them on your Facebook page or Twitter.
[00:07:43.858 --> 00:07:45.559]  It has a giant effect.
[00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:46.980]  We're in a war.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:57.066]  So don't underestimate how vital, how critical, how absolutely key it is that if you don't spread these links and if you don't reach out to people and tell people about the show...
[00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:00.608]  The censorship and control will be successful.
[00:08:00.608 --> 00:08:06.151]  If you spread the word, the Streisand effect will kick in, and it will explode in their face.
[00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:15.776]  Streisand effect is, if they try to censor somebody, and people take interest and spread the word, it generally blows up ten times bigger than it would have.
[00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:17.837]  But now we're up against AI and a lot more.
[00:08:20.376 --> 00:08:28.700]  So it's really up to all of us, and you've been doing it, and we've been swimming upstream and having victory here, and they're really, really getting panicked, but we are under attacks.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.022]  We need your hope, your prayer, and your support now more than ever, and I know you will do it.
[00:08:33.022 --> 00:08:42.106]  So, for myself, my family, the crew, and everybody else who's in this fight together, I salute you all, because you are the resistance.
[00:08:42.106 --> 00:08:43.847]  I can officially say
[00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:58.609]  That we've gone from the establishment being in very serious trouble globally to them now being in danger of complete and total absolute implosion.
[00:08:58.609 --> 00:09:03.773]  We're looking at the death of the New World Order, the death of the Anglo-American establishment,
[00:09:05.154 --> 00:09:08.756]  The death of the whole globalist authoritarian system.
[00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:13.199]  When I say Anglo-American establishment, it has nothing to do with Anglos.
[00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:22.504]  That is the technical term used by Zbigniew Brzezinski and by David Rockefeller and by other top globalists for
[00:09:24.713 --> 00:09:35.999]  Their global combined system, meaning Anglo-American, meaning a U.S.-British Empire power axis with a particular worldview that's not for the U.S.
[00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:45.804]  or the U.K., but that parlays our power into the world to establish a corporate, anti-free market, austerity-based world government.
[00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:49.506]  And that is countervailing the American system.
[00:09:50.635 --> 00:09:59.420]  So that is in deep trouble, and what is certainly on the rocks and breaking up, and that cannot be put back together again, is the Democratic Party.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:17.851]  The fact that they tried to steal the election, the fact that they did steal it from Bernie Sanders in the primary, the fact that they got caught in the WikiLeaks, the fact that the mainstream media went along with it all, and the establishment went along with it all, irrevocably, didn't just blow mortal wounds in the side of the Democrats.
[00:10:19.278 --> 00:10:31.580]  But mortally wounded, politically, financially, culturally, the entire mainstream media dinosaur combine that was already on its last legs, and now...
[00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:38.387]  It has infected their entire global system, and it is a chain reaction domino effect.
[00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:51.554]  All over the world, as people become wise to it, their entire facade, their entire hoax, their entire curtain, uh, smokescreen, with the man behind it, you know, running the powerful Oz machine, has collapsed.
[00:10:52.739 --> 00:11:06.270]  There's still a lot of zombies and people that don't notice, but everybody that is a thinking person is now admitting this is the case and that a worldwide tyranny was being established by very, very ruthless people with a eugenics worldview and aim.
[00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:18.700]  And so the fact that the FBI under Comey and under Mueller are just the poster children for hubris, arrogance, narcissistic, loon behavior.
[00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:22.512]  I mean, it's just a total confidence game.
[00:11:22.512 --> 00:11:42.643]  And the way they protected the Clintons on all their different crimes, the Foundation, and Uranium One, and the secret servers, and lying to Congress, and lying to the FBI, and stealing money from the Haitians, and being caught smuggling children on airplanes with convicted pedophiles.
[00:11:44.342 --> 00:11:45.743]  It would take hours to list it all.
[00:11:45.743 --> 00:11:47.985]  Most people start trying to think about the Clinton's crimes.
[00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:51.368]  It makes your head hurt, because there's so many examples.
[00:11:51.368 --> 00:12:00.776]  So, pulling back from it, the fact that the power structure bet everything on Hillary, and the fact that they said, if we don't get Hillary in, globalism is going to collapse.
[00:12:00.776 --> 00:12:10.925]  Financial Times of London, New Yorker Magazine, Atlantic Monthly, all the so-called elite publications, all the folks that hijacked America and thought they were invincible,
[00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:15.640]  A year and a half ago, they were saying, if Hillary loses, it's going to cause a chain reaction.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:23.424]  We've got to pull those articles up where they hit the panic button in the Rothschild-owned Economist, Financial Times of London.
[00:12:23.424 --> 00:12:28.105]  I mean, it was hundreds of them said, if she goes down, it's a chain reaction.
[00:12:28.105 --> 00:12:30.426]  And boy, you weren't lying.
[00:12:30.426 --> 00:12:32.387]  Because they'll lie in mainstream stuff for the public.
[00:12:32.387 --> 00:12:39.190]  In those more establishment publications, they're like, we're going to have the CIA kill the president.
[00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.551]  And then Phil Mudd thinks he can just go on CNN and say it.
[00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:43.051]  Well, guess what?
[00:12:43.051 --> 00:12:45.293]  The Secret Service is investigating that.
[00:12:45.293 --> 00:12:46.875]  I can tell you.
[00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:49.297]  They are investigating Mudd.
[00:12:49.297 --> 00:12:51.359]  They are investigating Clapper.
[00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:58.686]  Brennan went on the Aspen Institute three months ago and said he'll be gone by December extra-judicially.
[00:12:58.686 --> 00:13:00.107]  They said it won't be impeachment.
[00:13:02.045 --> 00:13:05.847]  I know that's legislative, but it's a judicial function of the legislative branch.
[00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:07.048]  That's what impeachment is.
[00:13:07.048 --> 00:13:09.990]  An indictment in the House, a trial in the Senate.
[00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.452]  And so the Secret Service just wanted me to know, from Washington...
[00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:20.980]  That, this was two days ago, that they are investigating these people and just said, do you have any more info?
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.943]  And so I'm getting them a bunch of information.
[00:13:24.943 --> 00:13:41.536]  They weren't even aware of some of the times Democrats and FBI operatives, he wasn't just CIA, also FBI, Mudd, who it appears his great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather was convicted of aiding John Wills Booth killing Lincoln.
[00:13:41.536 --> 00:13:43.118]  That's why they say your name will be Mudd.
[00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:47.560]  I'm not kidding, you can't make this up.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.021]  They're investigating them all.
[00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:51.282]  And I guess they just want them to know that, too.
[00:13:51.282 --> 00:13:52.982]  Go ahead and tell people.
[00:13:52.982 --> 00:13:54.803]  We are investigating them.
[00:13:54.803 --> 00:13:59.745]  So, analysts on Trump, the government's going to kill this guy.
[00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:10.249]  Well, Mr. Mudd, you had your big con game up there, trying to act powerful and act tough to other rogue groups in the government, to think, man, if they're talking about killing him on TV, he must be weak!
[00:14:12.298 --> 00:14:14.359]  You don't think people weren't aware of that?
[00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:19.120]  And now it's come out that Eric Prince and all these other groups have had private security the entire time.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.861]  I mean, I knew this but didn't talk about it.
[00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:25.202]  I know the other groups as well, out of Florida, that have been protecting Trump the entire time.
[00:14:25.202 --> 00:14:26.823]  Trump's not stupid.
[00:14:26.823 --> 00:14:29.884]  And they've got counter-surveillance on you!
[00:14:29.884 --> 00:14:32.165]  And now it's time for you to know that!
[00:14:33.137 --> 00:14:40.460]  Mr. Mudd, and Mr. Clinton, and Mr. Hillary, and all the rest of you people, and the Morning Joe.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:59.287]  You don't think the President would just bring up that mysterious death of the intern, getting their brains beat out, in the middle of the night in your office, if he wasn't intending to have some folks reopen that, because there's no statute of limitations, if it's deemed that another body's exhumed.
[00:14:59.287 --> 00:15:01.668]  Some are talking about that this was actually murder.
[00:15:03.294 --> 00:15:10.069]  No, I'm just saying, you guys want to play this game, you're about to get to play the game!
[00:15:11.687 --> 00:15:12.268]  You want it?
[00:15:12.268 --> 00:15:12.768]  You got it.
[00:15:12.768 --> 00:15:14.630]  See, a total overturn.
[00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.271]  A total new system.
[00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:17.412]  Back to America.
[00:15:17.412 --> 00:15:18.433]  Back to the future.
[00:15:18.433 --> 00:15:21.055]  Because America's been the future since we were founded.
[00:15:21.055 --> 00:15:24.878]  We've been the cutting edge of wanting liberty and striving and invention.
[00:15:24.878 --> 00:15:27.000]  And now we're getting back to the future.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.761]  You see?
[00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:35.807]  We're getting back to what was the cutting edge, instead of back to the super-ancient feudalism of globalism.
[00:15:35.807 --> 00:15:38.830]  Dead GOP AIDS autopsy report not released to the media.
[00:15:41.696 --> 00:15:44.239]  Well, well, well, Mr. Scarborough.
[00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:51.405]  You better run that con game up there on TV and act even more confident with you and Mika when you're really shaking in your boots.
[00:15:51.405 --> 00:15:54.448]  And you should be, little man!
[00:15:54.448 --> 00:15:56.270]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.071]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:01.680]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.502]  The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.

[00:16:27.993 --> 00:16:28.894]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:16:28.894 --> 00:16:31.656]  Could you please take a picture of my family and me with my cell phone?
[00:16:31.656 --> 00:16:33.757]  Sure, Mrs. Anderson.
[00:16:33.757 --> 00:16:35.398]  Smile for the camera.
[00:16:35.398 --> 00:16:39.521]  Too bad hackers never get proper permission to access your cell phone or computer camera.
[00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:42.443]  Anyone is or could be susceptible to illegal spying.

[00:16:58.564 --> 00:17:03.665]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:17:03.665 --> 00:17:09.366]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:14.567]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[00:17:16.508 --> 00:17:18.888]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[00:17:18.888 --> 00:17:19.848]  See guidelines.
[00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:23.129]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:16.433]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:16.433 --> 00:18:21.315]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:32.942]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[00:20:32.942 --> 00:20:38.065]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:40.043 --> 00:20:44.324]  Okay, let me do this, just so people know how important this transmission is.
[00:20:44.324 --> 00:20:45.945]  Let me just read you some of the headlines.
[00:20:45.945 --> 00:20:51.666]  We're going to be breaking down in detail throughout the transmission and tell you about some of the guests that are going to be joining us as well.
[00:20:51.666 --> 00:21:04.130]  But if you just tuned in, the old establishment that's anti-free market, that's pro-monopoly, and that's anti-Western and anti-Christian is getting broken up right now.
[00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:13.726]  The globalist, leftist, communist, robber baron funded system that wanted to create a worldwide monopoly and end competition.
[00:21:14.787 --> 00:21:20.351]  Is being busted up right now globally just because the people have woken up and don't want it.
[00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:32.680]  And there are now savvy individuals in government and in corporations and in the military that want prosperity and aren't complete psychopaths and are ready to ride this wave to power.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.364]  And I just say, come on in, come to power, and let's go to the stars.
[00:21:37.364 --> 00:21:38.645]  It's real simple.
[00:21:40.401 --> 00:21:43.303]  What did we tell Hillary during the whole campaign?
[00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:54.609]  We had a theme song for her, a little bit vulgar, but, because it insults female dogs, and I don't want to insult female dogs, the term isn't strong enough, but how's a ludicrous song go?
[00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:55.269]  Move, bitch!
[00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:56.410]  Get out the way!
[00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.010]  You see them headlights?
[00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.871]  You see them TVs?
[00:21:59.871 --> 00:22:00.852]  Who bought them TVs?
[00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:02.053]  Tell me that!
[00:22:02.053 --> 00:22:05.655]  The point is, is that, get out the way!
[00:22:05.655 --> 00:22:06.935]  Get out the way!
[00:22:06.935 --> 00:22:07.836]  Get out the way!
[00:22:08.948 --> 00:22:09.488]  Move!
[00:22:09.488 --> 00:22:10.689]  Get out the way!
[00:22:10.689 --> 00:22:13.031]  Get out the way!
[00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:13.971]  Get out the way!
[00:22:13.971 --> 00:22:15.692]  We don't want to fight with each other.
[00:22:15.692 --> 00:22:17.093]  We don't want to be a bunch of idiots.
[00:22:17.093 --> 00:22:21.576]  We don't want to fund radical Islamic groups to stir stuff up so we have an excuse to be in the Middle East.
[00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:27.848]  The weird Machiavellian geopolitical underhanded crap is bye-bye.
[00:22:27.848 --> 00:22:29.969]  That's not how we want to run civilization.
[00:22:29.969 --> 00:22:31.169]  It doesn't work.
[00:22:31.169 --> 00:22:37.552]  It works for scumbags that don't want prosperity and want to sit on top of third world banana republics.
[00:22:37.552 --> 00:22:40.494]  We don't want that.
[00:22:40.494 --> 00:22:47.577]  It doesn't mean if we shoot for being a pure society we're ever going to reach it, but it's a lot better than trying to be evil.
[00:22:47.577 --> 00:22:48.978]  So we're not selling a utopia.
[00:22:50.657 --> 00:22:57.199]  We're simply selling the Americana Renaissance system, the Enlightenment that we know is the best system by light years.
[00:22:57.199 --> 00:23:08.803]  Now, that said, coming up next segment, I'm going to get into the nightmare fires in California and some of that unbelievable footage.
[00:23:08.803 --> 00:23:10.704]  And all the other plagues that have come upon the state.
[00:23:12.105 --> 00:23:22.610]  Also, mainstream media is demonizing the president for keeping his promises and just talking about how terrible it is and how horrible it is.
[00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:27.253]  Donald Trump, keeper of promises, is what CNN says.
[00:23:27.253 --> 00:23:34.136]  And then they've got these graphs showing how he kept all his promises and is trying to keep the others and just how terrible this is.
[00:23:34.136 --> 00:23:35.697]  We're going to get into that.
[00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:39.839]  And then we're also going to get into Hamas leader calls for new intifada in the face of Israel.
[00:23:41.118 --> 00:23:55.169]  All Trump did was keep his promise, follow the law, three other presidents were scared to do it, and just say, we're calling your bluff, if you claim to attack us, we have an embassy in a city, where everybody else has their embassies, then go ahead!
[00:23:55.169 --> 00:23:58.292]  We're not going to give in to the threat of terrorism, is what that statement is.
[00:23:58.292 --> 00:24:01.734]  We've got Al Franken who's announced he's resigning, John Conyers, all of that.
[00:24:02.577 --> 00:24:04.379]  Russian military mission accomplished.
[00:24:04.379 --> 00:24:06.721]  Islamic State defeated in Syria.
[00:24:06.721 --> 00:24:18.691]  We have excerpts of the incoming FBI director defending the agency amid Trump criticism and the implosion of confidence in the agency after they were caught being completely political.
[00:24:18.691 --> 00:24:19.832]  They didn't just get caught.
[00:24:19.832 --> 00:24:21.974]  Mueller covered up everything for the Clintons.
[00:24:21.974 --> 00:24:22.655]  So did Comey.
[00:24:23.985 --> 00:24:26.606]  He does that fake Christian Lordy Lordy thing.
[00:24:26.606 --> 00:24:29.407]  I just am a good man of the Lord.
[00:24:29.407 --> 00:24:33.389]  I never even seen a woman with her clothes off.
[00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:35.870]  I just go to church nine days a week.
[00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.330]  Lordy Lordy.
[00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.071]  Yeah, right.
[00:24:38.071 --> 00:24:39.051]  Call me behind the scenes.
[00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:41.072]  Woo!
[00:24:41.072 --> 00:24:42.292]  Anyways.
[00:24:42.292 --> 00:24:44.193]  Lordy Lordy, I think would be the word for that.
[00:24:44.193 --> 00:24:46.894]  Let's just say it's phony as a three dollar bill.
[00:24:46.894 --> 00:24:53.377]  But, their attempt to get rid of Trump is baloney, and it's about a million years late, a trillion dollars short.
[00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:56.138]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:24:56.138 --> 00:25:01.949]  Meanwhile, the encryption cryptocurrency market is now worth more than JP Morgan.
[00:25:02.944 --> 00:25:05.626]  Which is worth 300 plus billion dollars.
[00:25:05.626 --> 00:25:12.811]  So now I'm wishing I invested in Bitcoin, but I couldn't understand it and people said, it's fiat like the government's money.
[00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:19.356]  And I go, well I know their money's fraudulent too, but I guess it's just been allowed to operate and be the new dominant system.
[00:25:19.356 --> 00:25:22.037]  370 billion smackers.
[00:25:22.037 --> 00:25:28.702]  And of course Bitcoin's a part of that, but wow, that's coming up as well today.
[00:25:28.702 --> 00:25:32.445]  So much to get to, we've got Senator Grassley just destroyed them.
[00:25:33.954 --> 00:25:39.196]  In a 35-minute speech he gave on the floor of the Senate yesterday.
[00:25:39.196 --> 00:25:43.997]  We're going to play some powerful excerpts of that first.
[00:25:43.997 --> 00:25:48.519]  But before I go any further, I have something I want to announce here today.
[00:25:48.519 --> 00:25:55.201]  And I think everybody should listen to me very, very carefully because we spent a lot of time and energy on this.
[00:25:55.201 --> 00:25:57.962]  I know folks love Super Mel Vitality and it's wonderful.
[00:25:57.962 --> 00:26:01.503]  I know folks love Anthroplex, it's excellent.
[00:26:02.654 --> 00:26:14.125]  But I set out to bring you a top-of-the-line formula with one of the top developers in the country that is so strong and so powerful that a lot of you probably won't even want to take it.
[00:26:14.125 --> 00:26:24.256]  You'll probably want to take the Anthroplex or the Alpha, the Super Mel Vitality, because this new product, Alpha Power,
[00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.091]  Actually has all the major clinical studies.
[00:26:28.091 --> 00:26:30.211]  We're even able to make major claims on it.
[00:26:30.211 --> 00:26:40.934]  We went out and got the certified, approved, most expensive ingredients, but sold to you at a price that leading competitors sell that is 50 times weaker.
[00:26:40.934 --> 00:26:41.694]  You heard me right.
[00:26:41.694 --> 00:26:42.874]  50 times.
[00:26:42.874 --> 00:26:51.917]  This, we can say, this is the strongest formula with these known kit compounds that anybody's got.
[00:26:52.657 --> 00:26:54.237]  And they're seen as safe.
[00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:57.638]  Now, that said, ladies and gentlemen, you better be careful with this.
[00:26:57.638 --> 00:26:59.519]  Alpha Power.
[00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:03.760]  Now, it's targeted at males, but it works great on women as well.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.441]  The secret ingredient behind the all-new Alpha Power is the main ingredient, LJ-100.
[00:27:08.441 --> 00:27:13.203]  Now, folks that know what that is know about it, but if you don't, you need to find out about it.
[00:27:13.203 --> 00:27:17.444]  It is the most potent, highest quality, and most studied extract in its category on the market.
[00:27:18.582 --> 00:27:34.027]  This ingredient is extracted to the most potent form available while maintaining the bioactive portion of the plant in the secret proprietary extraction process that ensures it's not been deteriorated or had any of its properties taken.
[00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:35.667]  It's not been denatured.
[00:27:35.667 --> 00:27:37.228]  Let me just explain this to you.
[00:27:37.228 --> 00:27:45.170]  Not only is it many times stronger than any other leading competitor that has just the so-called herbs, the way it's concentrated, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:27:47.836 --> 00:27:49.737]  is just completely insane.
[00:27:49.737 --> 00:27:52.379]  And it is just incredibly powerful.
[00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:58.784]  That's why you could say it's 50 times stronger than what other brands have with the so-called plant extract.
[00:27:58.784 --> 00:28:06.789]  Because LJ100 is patented, proven, documented, studied to just be the ultimate.
[00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:10.912]  And we've got a huge amount of it, ladies and gentlemen, in each capsule.
[00:28:10.912 --> 00:28:14.835]  What we can say, what I'm allowed to say, this is from the lawyers, boosts sports performance.
[00:28:15.623 --> 00:28:17.024]  Yes, there are real alpha pheromones!
[00:28:31.428 --> 00:28:36.893]  But more interesting during the day, encourages prostate health, helps support healthy cholesterol levels.
[00:28:36.893 --> 00:28:40.196]  I mean, this is going to be our best seller ever.
[00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:47.623]  Alpha Power, the first run, now available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:47.623 --> 00:28:52.088]  And I've got like 15 pages of the actual studies and literature on this.
[00:28:52.088 --> 00:28:56.492]  Find out today why it's called Alpha Power and support the transmission.

[00:32:00.053 --> 00:32:10.199]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:15.703]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:32:15.703 --> 00:32:18.705]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:32:18.705 --> 00:32:27.511]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:32:29.572 --> 00:32:49.177]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:32:49.177 --> 00:32:51.858]  It is amazing!
[00:32:51.858 --> 00:32:56.819]  Red Pill, now available at Infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:33:00.832 --> 00:33:03.446]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.274 --> 00:33:33.818]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:33.818 --> 00:33:36.258]  We're back live, folks.
[00:33:36.258 --> 00:33:37.739]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:37.739 --> 00:33:41.820]  And we've got to move quick now because there is so much incredible news to get to.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:48.942]  Again, I have Senator Grassley, who is bipartisanly respected as being really fair and even-handed.
[00:33:50.205 --> 00:33:58.910]  Destroying the partisanship of the FBI, and the two-sidedness, and the two different standards, and the emptiness of the Russiagate witch hunt.
[00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:02.172]  And that's because Hillary was going for broke.
[00:34:02.172 --> 00:34:03.772]  She'd committed all these crimes.
[00:34:03.772 --> 00:34:05.513]  She had to get it to the White House.
[00:34:05.513 --> 00:34:10.816]  And when she didn't, they had to turn it around and blame Trump for what they'd done.
[00:34:10.816 --> 00:34:19.301]  And by the mainstream media, and by the other Democrats signing onto this, and some Republicans, they have all irrevocably tied themselves
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:27.585]  To a big old box of rocks and chain their legs to it and throw themselves into the abyss.
[00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:29.606]  That's what they've done here.
[00:34:29.606 --> 00:34:38.614]  And it just shows how they believe because they're in charge of this big powerful country that they are invincible and they're not.
[00:34:38.614 --> 00:34:40.955]  So that's coming up.
[00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:42.176]  We have several guests joining us.
[00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:43.678]  I'll also open the phones up today.
[00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:51.411]  But before I go any further here, I'm going to go ahead and get into these reports out of California.
[00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:58.753]  We really should be praying for the folks there in California because it's a hellhole situation.
[00:34:58.753 --> 00:35:04.394]  You've got the super high taxes, the regulations, the TB outbreaks, homeless people.
[00:35:04.394 --> 00:35:07.095]  It seems like defecating all over the place.
[00:35:07.095 --> 00:35:12.276]  It looks like scenes out of hell from satellites and there's footage of people driving around.
[00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:13.036]  Most of you have seen it.
[00:35:14.144 --> 00:35:18.047]  And you just see huge fires spanning, in some cases, all around them.
[00:35:18.047 --> 00:35:24.692]  People wake up in the morning, and the fires were five miles away, and now the fires are just in their backyard.
[00:35:24.692 --> 00:35:29.455]  And the police and the firefighters are getting totally exhausted.
[00:35:29.455 --> 00:35:30.776]  They don't know what to do.
[00:35:30.776 --> 00:35:33.918]  And it just really seems biblical.
[00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:37.321]  I mean, I'm not saying God's judging California.
[00:35:38.613 --> 00:35:41.696]  I'm just saying it looks like something out of Armageddon.
[00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:44.839]  But oh, there's a bunch of Democrats and Hollywood people blaming Trump!
[00:35:44.839 --> 00:35:49.523]  They say this is an omen that, you know, it's because of Trump this is happening.
[00:35:49.523 --> 00:35:54.107]  So Ventura fires rage, threatens communities both coastal and inland, L.A.
[00:35:54.107 --> 00:35:54.927]  Times.
[00:35:54.927 --> 00:35:59.151]  Huge flames ripping down the mountain.
[00:35:59.151 --> 00:36:01.513]  The Thomas fire roars back to life.
[00:36:01.513 --> 00:36:03.335]  Homes threatened in Santa Paula.
[00:36:04.468 --> 00:36:10.850]  That's all because of those winds coming from the east, coming out over the west and then out to the sea.
[00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:15.652]  One of the images you really ought to see is the satellite images of the fires in California from NASA.
[00:36:15.652 --> 00:36:16.772]  It's incredible.
[00:36:16.772 --> 00:36:21.134]  Southern Cal fires scorch an area the size of Atlanta.
[00:36:21.134 --> 00:36:24.515]  And they're only getting tired, more and more exhausted.
[00:36:26.304 --> 00:36:30.026]  LAFD, Fire Department Chief, our people are getting tired.
[00:36:30.026 --> 00:36:30.887]  I bet they are.
[00:36:30.887 --> 00:36:32.228]  This is just, it's ongoing.
[00:36:32.228 --> 00:36:39.612]  Hurricane force gusts could cripple battle versus Southern California and the wildfires.
[00:36:39.612 --> 00:36:41.493]  You really got a feel for those folks.
[00:36:41.493 --> 00:36:47.337]  Rich residents flee burning Bel Air mansions in 5th Cali wildfire.
[00:36:47.337 --> 00:36:51.920]  And it just shows how the rich are not exempt from any of this.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.622]  But historically, people think as long as something is just down the street,
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.102]  It's not really going to affect them.
[00:36:59.102 --> 00:37:09.389]  Well, as we can see now, ladies and gentlemen, just because the fire's over your hill, doesn't mean tomorrow it won't be burning down your house.
[00:37:09.389 --> 00:37:13.132]  And that's an effective metaphor for just life in general.
[00:37:13.132 --> 00:37:19.697]  And the fires of communism, the fires of authoritarianism, the fires of the globalists imploding third world countries,
[00:37:25.677 --> 00:37:28.978]  They are being directed by the globalists in their own admissions.
[00:37:28.978 --> 00:37:35.321]  They use these crises to try to gain even more power and in many cases let the crises get completely out of control.
[00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:41.644]  Even if we have good management and are moral and upright and try to not destroy ourselves and the planet.
[00:37:41.644 --> 00:37:50.848]  Even if we do our best job, it's going to take praying and seeking God's discernment for humanity to make it to a type one civilization.
[00:37:50.848 --> 00:37:53.409]  That's a civilization that can live outside of its own planet.
[00:37:54.329 --> 00:37:57.792]  That's a civilization that makes it out of the nursery.
[00:37:57.792 --> 00:38:03.637]  That's a civilization that makes it from being a tadpole into a frog.
[00:38:03.637 --> 00:38:07.780]  Or from being a caterpillar into a butterfly.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:12.184]  And I can tell you right now, the globalists have decided to just mismanage stuff because it's too hard.
[00:38:12.184 --> 00:38:16.087]  Just use crises to get more control because they think humanity's already over.
[00:38:16.087 --> 00:38:18.389]  They're going to merge the machines.
[00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:21.651]  They're going to supposedly, you know, just become these AI gods.
[00:38:22.734 --> 00:38:27.775]  And so the Earth, they just think that they're going to transcend it by destroying it.
[00:38:27.775 --> 00:38:40.199]  That's the evil cosmology, the evil worldview, the evil ethos of what are the transhumanist who come out of the whole eugenics movement.
[00:38:40.199 --> 00:38:48.381]  I'm not saying your average garden variety, outer court, porch, transhumanist is a bad person.
[00:38:48.381 --> 00:38:50.402]  They just want to live longer and be cyborgs or whatever.
[00:38:51.226 --> 00:38:54.447]  And of course there's a lot of innovations there and a lot of people may choose to do that.
[00:38:54.447 --> 00:39:08.530]  The point is the globalists in the inner sanctum of transhumanism are worshipping an AI god that demands all of us first die before the select enlightened are given immortality.
[00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.091]  I've been telling you that for 20 years since I learned about it.
[00:39:11.091 --> 00:39:12.792]  Made a film 10 years ago about it.
[00:39:12.792 --> 00:39:14.812]  Elon Musk started warning you about a year ago.
[00:39:14.812 --> 00:39:17.513]  He said, I go to these meetings and they say humanity's over.
[00:39:17.513 --> 00:39:18.153]  We're getting rid of them.
[00:39:19.404 --> 00:39:23.405]  We're gonna merge with AI gods, we're building God.
[00:39:23.405 --> 00:39:29.707]  Elon Musk goes, listen, I go to these private, off-the-record meetings, and the majority of the billionaires plan to kill everybody.
[00:39:29.707 --> 00:39:35.529]  He goes, watch out, people that talk about AI gods, they're anti-human exterminists.
[00:39:35.529 --> 00:39:37.289]  And now it's all over the news.
[00:39:37.289 --> 00:39:39.350]  Everything I told you.
[00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:43.751]  What, do you think I just made this stuff up, and then somebody else picked it up?
[00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:47.512]  That's why all the mainstream media edits what I say, takes it out of context,
[00:39:49.005 --> 00:40:02.488]  To try to psychologically inoculate people so that when they first run into me live, or when I'm actually writing or saying, they just tune out and ignore it, thinking, oh, this guy, you know, this guy made this stuff up.
[00:40:02.488 --> 00:40:03.889]  This guy's full of baloney.
[00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:05.729]  This guy can't be trusted.
[00:40:05.729 --> 00:40:08.410]  Just, again, hoping you don't pay attention.
[00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:17.052]  Because, folks, it was in government documents 20 years ago that table boxes had hidden cameras and microphones in them, and I broke one open on television.
[00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:24.192]  And they literally sent private paramilitary after me to attack me physically in a parking lot and tell me to shut up.
[00:40:24.192 --> 00:40:27.953]  I mean, that's the type of stuff that's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:27.953 --> 00:40:40.816]  Because back then, if people would have found out then, there'd have been a big scare, a big freak out, but instead they roll it out slow, they water it down, they slowly introduce it.
[00:40:40.816 --> 00:40:44.938]  Until, okay, Samsung watches me, Sony watches me.
[00:40:44.938 --> 00:40:45.318]  Okay.
[00:40:46.328 --> 00:40:47.629]  My cable box watches me.
[00:40:47.629 --> 00:40:49.529]  Okay, my smartphone watches me.
[00:40:49.529 --> 00:40:52.511]  Okay, Airbnb watches me.
[00:40:52.511 --> 00:40:54.611]  Okay, okay, there are animal-human chimeras.
[00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:57.092]  Remember, I'd be talking about that 20 years ago.
[00:40:57.092 --> 00:40:58.053]  Oh, you're crazy.
[00:40:58.053 --> 00:40:59.133]  Now it's in the news.
[00:40:59.133 --> 00:41:00.974]  Oh, mice with human brains.
[00:41:00.974 --> 00:41:06.336]  Oh, humanoids grown in cows for their organs to be harvested.
[00:41:06.336 --> 00:41:08.537]  And they sign waiver forms and stuff.
[00:41:08.537 --> 00:41:09.618]  It's been approved.
[00:41:09.618 --> 00:41:11.378]  And people are already getting these livers.
[00:41:11.378 --> 00:41:12.699]  They're already getting these kidneys.
[00:41:12.699 --> 00:41:15.360]  They're just keeping an old DL down low.
[00:41:17.799 --> 00:41:21.563]  Now you see they're going to come out with it all.
[00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:23.865]  National Geographic and everywhere else.
[00:41:23.865 --> 00:41:26.127]  They're going, oh, we just now started doing it.
[00:41:26.127 --> 00:41:28.009]  No.
[00:41:28.009 --> 00:41:28.770]  It wasn't in it.
[00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:34.696]  It was an industry and DARPA literature that was public 22 years ago is the first time I saw it.
[00:41:34.696 --> 00:41:38.079]  And they were reporting on 10 and 15 year old projects in 1995.
[00:41:41.428 --> 00:41:43.749]  They're reporting on 10 and 15 year old projects.
[00:41:43.749 --> 00:41:44.970]  We're probably going on before that.
[00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.311]  So I'm done talking about that for now.
[00:41:47.311 --> 00:41:50.713]  When we come back, it's incredible.
[00:41:50.713 --> 00:41:56.156]  I've got the graphics from CNN themselves, but from their perspective, I think they're attacking the president.
[00:41:56.156 --> 00:41:59.617]  From our perspective, it's incredible.
[00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:03.900]  Where they show graphs of how he's horrible because he's delivering on his promises.
[00:42:04.969 --> 00:42:10.975]  And fighting to deliver on the other promises, and how he's naive, and how he's bad, and how he's stupid.
[00:42:11.977 --> 00:42:20.705]  Wait till that comes up and then, Senator Grassley, I mean it's a 35 minute speech so we should play all of it, but we've got it boiled down to like 15 minutes.
[00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.546]  I'm going to air that in the first part of the hour.
[00:42:22.546 --> 00:42:32.715]  Then Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, counter-terrorism expert joins us about the whole Israel situation, what he thinks Trump's really up to, what he thinks the responses are going to be.
[00:42:32.715 --> 00:42:35.618]  And then we have the Breitbart Israel editor.
[00:42:37.735 --> 00:42:43.882]  Joining us to get into that perspective on the whole situation and so much more.
[00:42:43.882 --> 00:42:51.491]  And then meanwhile, Obama blocked deportation of 550,000 illegals, more than Atlanta's entire population.
[00:42:51.491 --> 00:42:53.313]  That's being reported.
[00:42:53.313 --> 00:42:55.636]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:42:55.636 --> 00:42:56.276]  Spread those links.
[00:42:56.276 --> 00:42:56.557]  Thank you.
[00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:02.273]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:43:02.273 --> 00:43:10.359]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:43:10.359 --> 00:43:15.663]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:43:15.663 --> 00:43:18.185]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:43:18.185 --> 00:43:22.408]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:43:22.408 --> 00:43:24.850]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.

[00:46:59.964 --> 00:47:11.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.827 --> 00:47:14.448]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:14.448 --> 00:47:19.609]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:43.665]  It's escape from globalism!
[00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:47.208]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing something incredible happen.
[00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:49.911]  The entire planet is turning against the globalists.
[00:47:49.911 --> 00:47:53.013]  Not just here in the U.S., but all over the world.
[00:47:53.013 --> 00:47:58.598]  And the Democratic Party is officially now a coastal elites party.
[00:47:58.598 --> 00:47:59.939]  It is in freefall collapse.
[00:48:00.905 --> 00:48:02.785]  There is a total political realignment.
[00:48:02.785 --> 00:48:05.246]  The Republican establishment is in free fall collapse.
[00:48:05.246 --> 00:48:06.786]  They're being removed.
[00:48:06.786 --> 00:48:09.587]  The Secret Service is investigating.
[00:48:09.587 --> 00:48:16.868]  Democratic Party and deep state leaders that have been calling for Trump's death and who have been saying he'll soon be out of office.
[00:48:16.868 --> 00:48:22.069]  Incredible things are now happening.
[00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:29.090]  We feel like we've been the underdog and outside the power structure so long that we just think that the globalists are invincible.
[00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:29.450]  They're not.
[00:48:30.759 --> 00:48:37.544]  We're going to take the country and the world back and then it's up to us to be moral and strong and upstanding.
[00:48:37.544 --> 00:48:39.886]  And to not create a utopia, that's impossible.
[00:48:39.886 --> 00:48:41.647]  Look out, anybody tells you they can.
[00:48:41.647 --> 00:48:49.533]  But to get back to the closest thing we can to it, which is a rugged individualism-based system.
[00:48:49.533 --> 00:48:51.975]  So, incredible things are happening.
[00:48:51.975 --> 00:48:56.298]  It's an incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:48:56.298 --> 00:48:56.799]  That said,
[00:48:59.056 --> 00:49:13.186]  The culture of the mainstream media, and the culture and the nastiness the globalists have created, and the racism and enmity they've created, are aftershocks and problems we're going to have to deal with for a long time.
[00:49:13.186 --> 00:49:17.550]  We're defeating this current crop of arrogant pletnocrats.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:31.723]  But we've still got serious issues to deal with and you're still going to have a lot of these people trained in deception and trained in upside-down world inversion wandering around society.
[00:49:31.723 --> 00:49:34.323]  So there's going to be serious blowback from this.
[00:49:34.323 --> 00:49:39.785]  Most of them are getting fired or laid off right now because they couldn't deliver for the establishment.
[00:49:39.785 --> 00:49:45.106]  So that's why you see massive layoffs, massive exodus, 50% laid off at Time Warner.
[00:49:46.192 --> 00:49:49.317]  Layoffs being announced every day because they're frauds.
[00:49:49.317 --> 00:49:51.140]  They're piles of garbage.
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:50:01.176]  But you're going to have the zombie hordes now kind of wandering the land, setting up their own scallywag and carpetbag operations in your area.
[00:50:02.449 --> 00:50:04.510]  And I don't mean northerners coming to the South.
[00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:11.813]  I mean just like people come to any devastated area to take advantage of folks, we're going to see that in the modern sense.
[00:50:11.813 --> 00:50:22.717]  Just like the refugees from California bring their failed ways to your area and then try to collapse it not knowing why everything they touch turns to garbage.
[00:50:22.717 --> 00:50:24.478]  But here's the big story.
[00:50:24.478 --> 00:50:25.098]  It's all over.
[00:50:25.098 --> 00:50:27.239]  ABC News, NBC News, CBS News.
[00:50:28.274 --> 00:50:45.938]  They've gone from saying Trump's a liar, Trump's evil, Trump's a fraud, that hasn't worked, to okay, Trump is telling the truth, because they know his constituents, his supporters know he's telling the truth, but that's a bad idea, and he's a rube, and he's a hayseed, and he's a buffoon, and the experts know he's wrong.
[00:50:45.938 --> 00:50:50.879]  Same experts said he couldn't win, same experts said he couldn't have 3% growth rate, same experts say he couldn't control the border.
[00:50:51.775 --> 00:50:54.597]  And so they give a report card.
[00:50:54.597 --> 00:50:56.418]  There's two different articles.
[00:50:56.418 --> 00:50:59.941]  Donald Trump, keeper of promises.
[00:50:59.941 --> 00:51:04.744]  And there's a big article making fun of him and how he's obsessed with delivering.
[00:51:04.744 --> 00:51:12.149]  Then they got another article that is a graph breakdown, tracking Trump's promises.
[00:51:12.149 --> 00:51:16.512]  And then they go through it with a rundown, where it stands.
[00:51:16.512 --> 00:51:20.875]  And this is a rare moment where CNN is actually somewhat honest until the end.
[00:51:22.677 --> 00:51:32.487]  Trump's travel ban, 3.0, is now snaking its way to the Supreme Court, which said on October 24th it wouldn't hear arguments about the second one, which has now expired.
[00:51:32.487 --> 00:51:34.069]  Well, they've actually approved it.
[00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:38.374]  About a week earlier, a federal judge in Maryland blocked the third ban, finding that it wasn't
[00:51:40.066 --> 00:51:41.888]  Tainted by religious discrimination.
[00:51:41.888 --> 00:51:47.194]  Another federal judge in Hawaii did the same thing, saying it plainly discriminates based on nationality.
[00:51:47.194 --> 00:51:48.396]  More details here.
[00:51:48.396 --> 00:51:51.519]  So they throw a racism thing up front that has nothing to do with it.
[00:51:51.519 --> 00:51:56.525]  When it's about sovereignty and basic vetting and not having the UN vet who comes into the country.
[00:51:56.525 --> 00:51:57.607]  That's who's been in charge.
[00:51:57.607 --> 00:51:58.508]  Trump's now pulled out of that.
[00:51:59.352 --> 00:52:02.254]  And they finally get into what he's actually done.
[00:52:02.254 --> 00:52:09.119]  Number one, Trump signs an executive order, suspends for 90 days the entry of persons from seven heavily Muslim nations.
[00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:14.843]  Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and this order.
[00:52:14.843 --> 00:52:18.665]  And it goes on to say he delivered on that front.
[00:52:18.665 --> 00:52:22.568]  Then it continues, and you know, where it currently stands at this level.
[00:52:22.568 --> 00:52:25.690]  But the best way to do this is just to put the graph back on television for me, please.
[00:52:27.655 --> 00:52:30.777]  Because this printed off differently than I actually read the whole thing this morning.
[00:52:30.777 --> 00:52:32.338]  So there it is.
[00:52:32.338 --> 00:52:36.360]  He's about 30% there on repealing and replacing Obamacare.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.261]  I'd say with these latest tax votes, he's about 70% there.
[00:52:39.261 --> 00:52:41.202]  But at least they admit he's trying to do it.
[00:52:41.202 --> 00:52:42.803]  Halt Muslim entry to the U.S.
[00:52:42.803 --> 00:52:43.643]  They say he's 80% there.
[00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.270]  That's unvetted Muslims.
[00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:51.492]  So again, the lies are in the headlines, but still they're admitting he did what he said he'd do.
[00:52:51.492 --> 00:52:53.493]  Halt Muslim entry into the U.S.
[00:52:53.493 --> 00:52:57.894]  No, he's halting unvetted people from countries that don't even have real passports.
[00:52:57.894 --> 00:52:58.554]  Move the U.S.
[00:52:58.554 --> 00:53:00.875]  Embassy to Israel from Jerusalem.
[00:53:00.875 --> 00:53:02.396]  They say he's halfway there.
[00:53:02.396 --> 00:53:04.776]  Withdraw from Paris Climate Agreement.
[00:53:04.776 --> 00:53:05.117]  100%.
[00:53:05.117 --> 00:53:11.279]  That's the global carbon tax that Al Gore makes money off of and that India and China and everybody else are exempt from.
[00:53:11.279 --> 00:53:12.519]  Block Syrian refugees.
[00:53:12.519 --> 00:53:13.600]  They say he's 70% there.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.883]  Reverse environmental restrictions.
[00:53:16.883 --> 00:53:18.746]  You mean red taping to shut us down?
[00:53:18.746 --> 00:53:20.669]  They say he's about 60% there.
[00:53:20.669 --> 00:53:21.871]  Improve Russian relations.
[00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:24.376]  He's 10% there, but they're not letting him go the rest of the way.
[00:53:26.001 --> 00:53:28.783]  Build a US-Mexico border wall.
[00:53:28.783 --> 00:53:29.944]  They say he's 20% there.
[00:53:29.944 --> 00:53:33.446]  I'd say it's more like 40% because they're already building the demos and started.
[00:53:33.446 --> 00:53:34.848]  That's half the battle.
[00:53:34.848 --> 00:53:37.229]  Deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
[00:53:37.229 --> 00:53:39.411]  He's already deported about 35%.
[00:53:39.411 --> 00:53:43.034]  Green light pipelines like DAPL and Keystone.
[00:53:43.034 --> 00:53:44.495]  He's 90% there.
[00:53:44.495 --> 00:53:46.056]  Withdraw from the TPP.
[00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.117]  Global total takeover.
[00:53:47.117 --> 00:53:47.297]  100% there.
[00:53:49.258 --> 00:53:52.521]  Renegotiate from the withdrawal of NAFTA and GATS.
[00:53:52.521 --> 00:53:53.401]  70% there.
[00:53:53.401 --> 00:53:54.302]  That's accurate.
[00:53:54.302 --> 00:53:56.744]  I can't believe CNN actually told the truth, partly.
[00:53:56.744 --> 00:53:58.265]  I was amazed this morning.
[00:53:58.265 --> 00:54:02.989]  Lower taxes for individuals and corporations.
[00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:04.690]  He's about 15% there.
[00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:09.494]  And with this week's tax vote, I'd say he's 40% there.
[00:54:09.494 --> 00:54:12.356]  Reintegrate and renegotiate the Iran deal.
[00:54:12.356 --> 00:54:12.536]  20% there.
[00:54:14.062 --> 00:54:15.406]  Bring back torture.
[00:54:15.406 --> 00:54:17.131]  Zero percent there.
[00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:20.501]  That's something I don't really agree with and he backed off that.
[00:54:21.328 --> 00:54:23.449]  He's just being open when he thought, because it's already going on.
[00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:28.570]  And he was just being honest, and I don't even agree with it, but then I agree that he's being honest.
[00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.251]  So there you go, that's actually not true.
[00:54:30.251 --> 00:54:32.931]  They're torturing people.
[00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:38.653]  Believe me, they're torturing a lot of folks that are ISIS or Al-Qaeda, and I think it's dangerous to turn into what we're fighting with.
[00:54:38.653 --> 00:54:39.293]  There you go.
[00:54:39.293 --> 00:54:41.454]  It's certainly been working so far, though.
[00:54:41.454 --> 00:54:42.714]  Get rid of Common Core.
[00:54:42.714 --> 00:54:44.635]  Hasn't got that done yet, but it's trying.
[00:54:44.635 --> 00:54:45.415]  Defeat ISIS.
[00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:46.235]  They say he's 95% there.
[00:54:49.261 --> 00:54:51.322]  Create a Muslim registry.
[00:54:51.322 --> 00:54:52.302]  That's how they spun it.
[00:54:52.302 --> 00:54:53.743]  It's not a Muslim registry.
[00:54:53.743 --> 00:54:56.685]  It's an extremist registry of people saying they want to kill folks.
[00:54:56.685 --> 00:54:57.105]  Okay?
[00:54:57.105 --> 00:54:59.466]  So that's just a fake point at the end.
[00:54:59.466 --> 00:55:01.867]  Build a Guantanamo Bay.
[00:55:01.867 --> 00:55:03.228]  That's not what he said.
[00:55:03.228 --> 00:55:04.568]  Rebuild America's infrastructure.
[00:55:04.568 --> 00:55:05.969]  They say zero.
[00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:08.710]  No, he's already got about 15% of that going.
[00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:11.552]  They're just trying to tell you like Lloyd Blankfein said, it'll never happen.
[00:55:12.782 --> 00:55:13.983]  And then the final big lie.
[00:55:13.983 --> 00:55:16.124]  They lie about him rebuilding America's infrastructure.
[00:55:16.124 --> 00:55:17.205]  He's gotten that going.
[00:55:17.205 --> 00:55:19.687]  And they lie about him bringing back jobs from overseas.
[00:55:19.687 --> 00:55:22.309]  Thousands of companies have announced they're coming back.
[00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:23.790]  Hundreds have come back.
[00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:26.312]  And he stopped hundreds from leaving.
[00:55:26.312 --> 00:55:30.374]  So at the end, they lie about some of his biggest accomplishments.
[00:55:30.374 --> 00:55:31.415]  How about the stock market?
[00:55:31.415 --> 00:55:33.056]  He said he wanted to get the stock market up.
[00:55:33.056 --> 00:55:34.077]  Up at record levels.
[00:55:34.077 --> 00:55:36.018]  How about getting consumer confidence back?
[00:55:36.018 --> 00:55:37.159]  Record levels.
[00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:38.860]  How about getting small business startups back?
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:39.421]  Record levels.
[00:55:41.277 --> 00:55:58.091]  So they don't really show everything he's done by a long mile, crushing political correctness, getting more visits for our VA folks, it's up massively, something like, almost double the amount of appointments they're getting and they're now privatizing it out and stuff, I mean, so he's delivering there.
[00:55:58.091 --> 00:56:02.855]  And I'm not worshipping Trump, I'm worshipping the truth.
[00:56:02.855 --> 00:56:04.677]  You shall know the truth, it shall set you free.
[00:56:05.748 --> 00:56:15.415]  The power of truth, and it's just the truth, and I'm surprised that they're having to admit some of the truth, but in the article they spin it like he's a buffoon.
[00:56:15.415 --> 00:56:17.396]  Everybody knows you're supposed to lie.
[00:56:17.396 --> 00:56:20.058]  Everybody knows you're not supposed to tell your constituents the truth.
[00:56:20.058 --> 00:56:24.721]  Everybody knows, and all the experts say he's an idiot, and blah, blah, blah.
[00:56:24.721 --> 00:56:31.386]  No, you're the idiots that hijacked the country, and then now think it belongs to you and are mad we're taking it back.
[00:56:32.386 --> 00:56:38.532]  Now, before I end this hour, we have a bunch of specials that are going to end this weekend coming up.
[00:56:38.532 --> 00:56:48.441]  That's 50% off the high-quality Super Blue toothpaste for adults and children, emboldened and empowered and fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[00:56:48.441 --> 00:56:51.104]  50% off, and so is the concentrated mouthwash.
[00:56:51.104 --> 00:56:52.145]  That's called Dr. Jones.
[00:56:52.145 --> 00:56:56.249]  That's my dad, a dentist and oral surgeon's Super Blue toothpaste, made by one of the biggest
[00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:58.572]  Organic manufacturers in the country.
[00:56:58.572 --> 00:57:00.054]  We have the Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:57:00.054 --> 00:57:05.202]  It is 50% off as well and a bunch of other big specials.
[00:57:05.202 --> 00:57:07.966]  And now the new ultimate
[00:57:08.908 --> 00:57:19.174]  Female and male stamina, energy, libido, brain, heart, body, sleep, because it makes you more awake during the day and more sleepy at night.
[00:57:19.174 --> 00:57:23.096]  You can actually make these claims because a bunch of the stuff in it is certified and patented and confirmed.
[00:57:23.096 --> 00:57:31.700]  Boosts sports performance, increases physical and mental energy, helps maintain normal high free testosterone levels in men, boosts healthy alpha pheromones.
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:32.801]  Just one of the ingredients is LJ-100.
[00:57:35.587 --> 00:57:38.269]  LJ-100 is super potent level.
[00:57:38.269 --> 00:57:39.690]  So be careful, folks.
[00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:40.711]  This isn't a game.
[00:57:40.711 --> 00:57:42.912]  Alpha Power and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:57:42.912 --> 00:57:44.413]  Hour number two coming up.
[00:57:44.413 --> 00:57:44.954]  Spread links.
[00:57:44.954 --> 00:57:45.554]  It's a war.
[00:57:45.554 --> 00:57:46.055]  Spread links.
[00:57:46.055 --> 00:57:46.395]  It's a war.
[00:57:48.001 --> 00:57:48.481]  Not agree.
[00:57:48.481 --> 00:57:49.942]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:57:49.942 --> 00:57:51.262]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:57:51.262 --> 00:57:52.483]  Why is this show good?
[00:57:52.483 --> 00:57:57.765]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:57:57.765 --> 00:58:11.310]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:12.651]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:15.092]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:58:15.092 --> 00:58:17.653]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:58:17.653 --> 00:58:18.973]  These are all parasites.
[00:58:18.973 --> 00:58:20.074]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:58:20.074 --> 00:58:21.414]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:58:21.414 --> 00:58:25.916]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:58:25.916 --> 00:58:29.178]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:58:29.178 --> 00:58:32.259]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:33.299]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:58:33.299 --> 00:58:35.220]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.241]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:58:36.241 --> 00:58:38.962]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:58:38.962 --> 00:58:39.162]  And, uh,
[00:58:39.842 --> 00:58:40.863]  You support the broadcast.
[00:58:40.863 --> 00:58:42.204]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:58:42.204 --> 00:58:44.465]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:58:44.465 --> 00:58:46.427]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.701]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[00:58:52.701 --> 00:59:07.323]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:59:07.323 --> 00:59:14.885]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:59:15.145 --> 00:59:15.425]  Thank you.
[00:59:15.425 --> 00:59:20.347]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[00:59:20.347 --> 00:59:23.288]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[00:59:23.288 --> 00:59:26.569]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:32.611]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:59:32.851 --> 00:59:35.392]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:13.511]  Big Brother.
[01:00:13.511 --> 01:00:15.373]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:15.373 --> 01:00:17.014]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.555]  You want answers?
[01:00:18.555 --> 01:00:20.177]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.177 --> 01:00:24.240]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:30.345]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a must-see article
[01:00:38.911 --> 01:00:52.159]  Up on Infowars.com right now, by Paul Joseph Watson, titled, CNN admits Trump has kept most of his promises.
[01:00:52.159 --> 01:01:01.945]  News networks shocked that President would risk angering elite by actually following through on his word, and they admit the other promises he hasn't kept, he's trying to get them kept.
[01:01:01.945 --> 01:01:03.947]  Well, that's because as a businessman and a billionaire,
[01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:10.889]  A self-made man, he spent millions of dollars on op-ed articles against NAFTA and GATT and exposing globalism.
[01:01:10.889 --> 01:01:15.631]  His dad was an anti-communist that gave money to the John Birch Society and was a patriot.
[01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:19.252]  And so he's sick of everything you're sick of and he's really real.
[01:01:19.252 --> 01:01:23.234]  Doesn't mean he's perfect, but he's really real and that's why they're freaked out.
[01:01:23.234 --> 01:01:29.956]  And you see the prosperity come roaring back, ladies and gentlemen, because God forbid that the President
[01:01:31.391 --> 01:01:36.313]  Actually keep his promises, and you go through the graph of all the things they show, the promises he's kept.
[01:01:36.313 --> 01:01:38.254]  This is an important article.
[01:01:38.254 --> 01:01:45.558]  This article on Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson needs to go mega viral, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:45.558 --> 01:01:52.941]  Now, there is so much breaking news unfolding right now, but let's get back on how they're attacking the president.
[01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:58.304]  Al Franken, just 30 minutes ago, resigned on the Senate floor, announced he has plans to resign.
[01:02:00.569 --> 01:02:11.742]  It might be like Brian Williams who said he was leaving NBC News but folks forgot what a big liar he is and how he wasn't shot down in a helicopter and all his other fake reports.
[01:02:11.742 --> 01:02:14.265]  He then came back as I predicted.
[01:02:14.265 --> 01:02:20.051]  But the fall of Al Franken, champion of women, slams Trump more on the way out.
[01:02:21.092 --> 01:02:22.213]  Here's the issue.
[01:02:22.213 --> 01:02:26.936]  We didn't have these allegations about Trump until he ran for president.
[01:02:26.936 --> 01:02:32.099]  These have been known about you forever and there's photos and there's videos and there's now more than 20 women.
[01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:34.820]  With Trump, a lot of the lawsuits turned out to be Jane Doe's.
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.841]  They weren't real people.
[01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:37.722]  And it was totally fake.
[01:02:39.605 --> 01:02:44.207]  People understand that you're also part of the globalist establishment they want out.
[01:02:44.207 --> 01:02:49.670]  So it's your party that makes your allegations the reason people have to go, not Trump.
[01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:54.192]  He didn't go for the allegations, most of which turned out to be false.
[01:02:54.192 --> 01:02:55.132]  Okay?
[01:02:55.132 --> 01:02:56.593]  He didn't leave.
[01:02:56.593 --> 01:03:03.056]  You guys create this stampede because this is your political weapon and now it's blown up in your own face.
[01:03:05.026 --> 01:03:06.487]  But it's bigger than that.
[01:03:06.487 --> 01:03:18.973]  It's been mainly Democrats, it's been reported, upwards of 90% they're saying that have been paid out to victims in the harassment and in the assaults inside Congress.
[01:03:18.973 --> 01:03:23.035]  So again, you're the ones with John Conyers and creepy Joe Biden.
[01:03:23.035 --> 01:03:27.197]  I mean, we got photos of him at Christmas parties grabbing women by their breasts.
[01:03:27.197 --> 01:03:31.219]  I saw some more videos just yesterday I meant to give to the crew, I forgot.
[01:03:31.219 --> 01:03:32.080]  Pat Riley has them.
[01:03:33.712 --> 01:03:35.514]  Because I was looking at him on his phone, I'm like, what?
[01:03:35.514 --> 01:03:44.442]  I was looking at his photos on his Facebook, and I was like, I never saw this, and I hit video, and it's him at a Christmas party, last year, grabs the woman's breast!
[01:03:44.442 --> 01:03:47.785]  Full-grown woman, just, I mean, next to the guy's wife!
[01:03:47.785 --> 01:03:50.167]  So, you're the guys that are out of control!
[01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:54.971]  Sure, there's some Republican perverts as well, but that's what's happening here.
[01:03:54.971 --> 01:04:03.396]  So here he is blaming Trump and others on his way out for being a sack of unfunny, unscrupulous, Harvey Weinstein garbage.
[01:04:03.396 --> 01:04:06.778]  Here he is.
[01:04:06.778 --> 01:04:17.325]  I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape
[01:04:18.556 --> 01:04:27.117]  about his history of sexual assault sits in the oval office and a man who is repeatedly preyed on young girls
[01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:30.883]  That's enough.
[01:04:30.883 --> 01:04:34.464]  I'm going to play more coming up.
[01:04:34.464 --> 01:04:36.044]  We're going to go to break here.
[01:04:36.044 --> 01:04:42.005]  But did you catch how they wrote that to make it sound like he brags about assaulting women in the Oval Office?
[01:04:42.005 --> 01:04:44.806]  He wasn't in the Oval Office when this supposedly happened.
[01:04:44.806 --> 01:04:45.806]  He wasn't bragging about it.
[01:04:45.806 --> 01:04:46.746]  It's all in edited tape.
[01:04:46.746 --> 01:04:49.047]  He's saying, women, throw themselves on you.
[01:04:49.047 --> 01:04:50.687]  You can do anything you want.
[01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:52.467]  Like Elvis with women climbing on top of him.
[01:04:57.156 --> 01:05:00.117]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:09.220]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.601]  So what do we do about it?
[01:05:10.601 --> 01:05:13.722]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:05:13.902 --> 01:05:21.629]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[01:05:21.629 --> 01:05:27.874]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.

[01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:49.265]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[01:05:49.265 --> 01:05:50.586]  It's the real deal.
[01:05:50.586 --> 01:05:52.326]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:05:52.326 --> 01:05:55.647]  Secure your bottle right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:06.607 --> 01:06:09.349]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:12.071]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:13.512]  Listen, baby.
[01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:22.298]  Ain't no mountain high, ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough, baby.
[01:06:22.298 --> 01:06:27.762]  If you need me, call me, no matter where you are, no matter how far.
[01:06:29.429 --> 01:06:37.734]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:37.734 --> 01:06:42.296]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and big things are happening.
[01:06:42.296 --> 01:06:55.844]  That little snot-nosed actor and failed comedian, Al Franken, that demonic goblin creature, has now announced he's going to be leaving the Senate.
[01:06:57.622 --> 01:07:07.087]  And they'll have some new little shark-toothed gremlin climb out of Mordor and, I guess, try to continue their strangulation of the country.
[01:07:07.087 --> 01:07:13.009]  And you've got John Conyers leaving, and all these others having to leave, and all these rhino, neocon Republicans.
[01:07:13.009 --> 01:07:17.171]  What is it, like four of them in the Senate, 15 of them or so in the House?
[01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:22.414]  They're leaving because their constituents are awake now, and they're saying, we want you gone.
[01:07:23.766 --> 01:07:38.472]  But the big news, the big news is that they went a bridge too far trying to steal the election, steal the nomination from Sanders, trying to stop Trump from being seated as president, trying to block people going to the inauguration, beating up families.
[01:07:38.472 --> 01:07:51.278]  The fake Russia investigation just drew attention to Uranium One and the cover-ups of the foundation, and the servers, and the missing kids, and the kidnapped Haitians, and the stolen Haitian money, and on and on and on.
[01:07:53.075 --> 01:08:06.803]  And now they're looking at Mueller and they're looking at Comey and their arrogance waddling around trying to frustrate the American voters and trying to stop the economic recovery and trying to destroy the FBI.
[01:08:06.803 --> 01:08:22.052]  And suddenly, Democratic pundits even on MSNBC and CNN are hedging their bets going, well this does look bad, this partisanship, not just to this one senior Russia expert FBI guy that we now know got the info from the made-up $13 million PPGate dossier.
[01:08:24.821 --> 01:08:44.312]  But now, now we're learning more of these people are in emails and text messages and that the Congress has damning bombshell info that they're just waiting to see if Comey and Mueller do the right thing and back off, and they're not going to!
[01:08:44.312 --> 01:08:48.475]  They're never going to give up, just like Monty Python, where the Knight's attacking the guy.
[01:08:49.437 --> 01:08:52.138]  And he cuts his arms off, his legs off, and he won't stop.
[01:08:52.138 --> 01:08:53.438]  He goes, look, I've cut your arms and legs off.
[01:08:53.438 --> 01:08:55.959]  And he goes, it's a mere flesh wound!
[01:08:55.959 --> 01:08:56.759]  Coward!
[01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:58.779]  And keeps attacking.
[01:08:58.779 --> 01:09:01.520]  They don't know when to give up.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.240]  And they're never going to give up.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.501]  Until we politically put them down.
[01:09:07.501 --> 01:09:09.682]  They're saying on TV they're going to kill the president.
[01:09:09.682 --> 01:09:10.882]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:09:10.882 --> 01:09:15.143]  They've got former deputy FBI directors that Mueller brought in saying they're going to kill the president.
[01:09:16.052 --> 01:09:17.953]  The Secret Service is investigating it.
[01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:18.874]  They're crazy!
[01:09:18.874 --> 01:09:19.935]  They have to act confident.
[01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:22.857]  They have to act like, come on everybody, let's go kill Trump!
[01:09:22.857 --> 01:09:23.797]  Let's save the Russia!
[01:09:23.797 --> 01:09:26.019]  Come on, I'm saying it on TV, we're strong!
[01:09:26.019 --> 01:09:26.880]  No, you're not.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.903]  Your goddess, your leader, is a demonic crone that can hardly walk.
[01:09:31.903 --> 01:09:33.504]  You're delusional filth.
[01:09:33.504 --> 01:09:38.628]  Just because you sat on top of the country when it was asleep forever, sucking it dry, doesn't mean it goes on forever.
[01:09:40.265 --> 01:09:43.387]  Now there's a bunch of these, and I'm going to have to play more of these in the next hour.
[01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:45.708]  The full speech is up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:45.708 --> 01:09:51.311]  Grassley slams bipartisan oversight of FBI investigation.
[01:09:51.311 --> 01:09:53.352]  Grassley outlines political bias.
[01:09:53.352 --> 01:09:56.874]  Grassley addresses shortcomings of vetting fusion GPS dossier.
[01:09:56.874 --> 01:10:01.357]  Grassley details problems concerning Clinton email investigation.
[01:10:01.357 --> 01:10:02.998]  Which one should we play first, Matt?
[01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.639]  Grassley outlines political bias of FBI.
[01:10:07.128 --> 01:10:11.811]  Yeah, let's do Grassley Slam's bipartisan oversight of FBI investigation.
[01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:14.733]  This is, again, on Infowars.com from last night.
[01:10:14.733 --> 01:10:17.254]  Here it is.
[01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:22.957]  I have been doing oversight of the executive branch for a very long time.
[01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:25.639]  I've done it as ranking member.
[01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:28.341]  I've done it as chairman.
[01:10:28.341 --> 01:10:31.763]  I've done it when my party held the White House.
[01:10:31.763 --> 01:10:35.145]  And I've done it when the other party held the White House.
[01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:47.771]  Earlier this year, I stood up for the rights of my Democrat colleagues to do oversight of the Trump administration, even while they are in the minority.
[01:10:47.771 --> 01:10:51.812]  I did it because it was the right thing to do.
[01:10:51.812 --> 01:11:01.635]  Lots of people give lip service to the notion of bipartisan oversight, but very few actually practice it.
[01:11:01.635 --> 01:11:02.075]  It's tough.
[01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:11.413]  You have to be willing to work with colleagues in the other party to ask tough questions of your own political allies.
[01:11:11.413 --> 01:11:13.255]  And you can't just ask.
[01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:18.475]  If you actually want answers, you have to follow through.
[01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:24.520]  True bipartisan oversight is impossible unless it's a two-way street.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:36.310]  If Democrats are unwilling to ask hard questions and force answers from their own political allies, then there simply is no way to move forward together in good faith.
[01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:40.394]  Both sides need to be committed to getting the whole story.
[01:11:41.161 --> 01:11:45.282]  Not just the half that they think helps their side.
[01:11:45.282 --> 01:11:52.824]  Regardless of whether my Democrat colleagues join me or not, I'm interested in that whole story.
[01:11:52.824 --> 01:12:02.026]  There are two major controversies plaguing the credibility of the Justice Department and the FBI right now.
[01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:04.587]  On the one hand, the Trump-Russia investigation.
[01:12:05.729 --> 01:12:10.653]  And then, on the other hand, the handling of the Clinton investigation.
[01:12:10.653 --> 01:12:20.220]  Any congressional oversight related to either one of these topics is not credible without also examining the other.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:25.785]  Both cases were active during last year's campaign.
[01:12:25.785 --> 01:12:30.909]  Both cases have been linked to the firing of the FBI director.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:37.424]  I have been trying to explain this to my Democratic colleagues for months.
[01:12:37.424 --> 01:12:47.650]  The political reality is that half of the country thinks that our law enforcement establishment gave Hillary Clinton and her aides a pass.
[01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:55.195]  These questions go to the heart of the integrity of our federal law enforcement and justice system.
[01:12:56.434 --> 01:13:01.316]  They're not going to go away just because Clinton lost the election.
[01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:09.379]  The independent Inspector General at the Justice Department certainly isn't ignoring that issue.
[01:13:09.379 --> 01:13:20.623]  Democrats and Republicans in Congress have asked the Inspector General to look into a host of issues involving the handling of the Clinton investigation during the campaign.
[01:13:21.747 --> 01:13:28.029]  His hard work has already uncovered some pretty disturbing information.
[01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:43.593]  Over the past week, the press has reported that an FBI agent was removed from the special counsel's team and demoted at the FBI due to, what do you think, political bias.
[01:13:43.593 --> 01:13:50.255]  The agent was at the very center of both of these high-profile investigations.
[01:13:52.208 --> 01:14:12.113]  High-ranking FBI agent Peter Strzok reportedly used his work phone to send anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages to another FBI agent with whom he was having an illicit and immoral relationship.
[01:14:12.113 --> 01:14:12.673]  This man
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:20.022]  was the Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI's Counterintelligence Division.
[01:14:20.022 --> 01:14:31.386]  He worked on the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private server to conduct, what do you think, official business.
[01:14:32.521 --> 01:14:46.668]  According to news reports and according to documents, it looks like he also helped draft Comey's controversial public statement ending that case of Hillary Clinton and the emails.
[01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:55.245]  Specifically, he apparently edited out language that suggested legal jeopardy for Clinton.
[01:14:55.245 --> 01:15:08.972]  Press reports state that he opened the FBI's investigation of allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
[01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:14.135]  And it's been reported that he was one of the two FBI agents
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:21.423]  Who interviewed former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
[01:15:21.423 --> 01:15:27.265]  Can you imagine if the shoe were on the other foot?
[01:15:27.265 --> 01:15:36.289]  What if a high-ranking FBI official got caught expressing pro-Trump political bias on his work?
[01:15:37.361 --> 01:15:48.232]  On his work phone, while leading what is supposed to be a professional, objective, and non-partisan search for the truth.
[01:15:48.232 --> 01:15:50.495]  Well, I say the facade would fall.
[01:15:50.495 --> 01:15:53.198]  We'll be right back where it really gets powerful, straight ahead.
[01:15:53.198 --> 01:15:54.319]  Stay with us, I'm Alex Jones.

[01:18:57.182 --> 01:19:04.109]  President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel this week in a move that some say will shake the Middle East to the core.
[01:19:04.109 --> 01:19:07.353]  Israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with Trump's announcement.
[01:19:07.353 --> 01:19:12.879]  The Turkish president warned Trump that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a red line.
[01:19:12.879 --> 01:19:16.202]  The Saudis are calling this a flagrant provocation of Muslims.
[01:19:16.202 --> 01:19:18.785]  And Palestinian leaders have already planned for protests.
[01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:31.092]  Terror group Hamas is calling for a day of rage Friday, urging Palestinians in an official Arabic statement to send a message with all available means to Israel after the upcoming Friday prayers.
[01:19:31.092 --> 01:19:33.253]  Ahead of President Trump's announcement, the U.S.
[01:19:33.253 --> 01:19:40.557]  military deployed additional forces throughout the Middle East in anticipation of widespread political unrest and even terror attacks.
[01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:41.598]  Although some U.S.
[01:19:41.598 --> 01:19:44.899]  officials had urged Trump not to make this sort of a move, U.S.
[01:19:44.899 --> 01:19:47.921]  policy should never be dictated by threats of violence.
[01:19:47.921 --> 01:19:53.904]  With the opposition against Trump's historic decision-building, the days ahead could turn out to be tumultuous.
[01:19:53.904 --> 01:19:59.307]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[01:19:59.307 --> 01:20:02.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.501 --> 01:20:14.782]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:20:14.782 --> 01:20:16.983]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:20:16.983 --> 01:20:19.584]  Mao took the guns.
[01:20:19.584 --> 01:20:22.765]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:20:22.765 --> 01:20:26.227]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:20:44.113 --> 01:20:49.575]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:20:49.575 --> 01:20:52.696]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:20:52.696 --> 01:21:02.040]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny of the mind.
[01:21:06.192 --> 01:21:07.315]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:21:07.315 --> 01:21:09.381]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:17.679 --> 01:21:26.363]  By the way, you can go back to ads I did 15 years ago where I do thumbs up for ball caps and shirts and them, like, you know, the A-OK symbol.
[01:21:26.363 --> 01:21:35.987]  When I grew up, people, I guess Trump kind of was a 70s guy or something, because back when I was a kid, the 70s thumbs up and everything's great, like race car drivers or Evel Knievel.
[01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:39.449]  You know, after he made a jump, he'd do a thumbs up.
[01:21:39.449 --> 01:21:46.012]  And then, like, if something was A-OK, or, like, if grandma made some really good food, my uncle would walk out and he'd go, he'd go, man, it's good.
[01:21:46.012 --> 01:21:51.535]  And then maybe even, you know, kiss the, you know, kiss the two fingers, the index and the thumb when they go together.
[01:21:51.535 --> 01:21:56.378]  And people go, look, Jones is doing a Illuminati program, just like Trump.
[01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:57.159]  No, actual
[01:21:58.362 --> 01:22:08.287]  Psychology experts back when he was running in liberal and conservative publications had to admit, no, when Trump puts his index and his thumb together, he means he's committed.
[01:22:08.287 --> 01:22:09.667]  I'm going to defend the borders.
[01:22:09.667 --> 01:22:13.029]  I'm going to declare Jerusalem the capital.
[01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:15.890]  I'm going to not go after your guns.
[01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:16.671]  And then he puts that.
[01:22:17.927 --> 01:22:18.707]  Those fingers together.
[01:22:18.707 --> 01:22:19.988]  That means I'm doing it.
[01:22:19.988 --> 01:22:21.568]  It means I plan to do it.
[01:22:21.568 --> 01:22:23.489]  And I'm the exact same way.
[01:22:23.489 --> 01:22:25.310]  And there's video evidence of it.
[01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:27.931]  And I don't know why I do the same mannerisms Trump does.
[01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:33.313]  It's just, to me growing up, two thumbs up meant, man, this is really good.
[01:22:34.198 --> 01:22:38.340]  Even if you're on top of a house roofing it or something, wind was blowing, you know.
[01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:43.342]  Grandpa's out at the truck getting more shingles off and, hey, you know, are we going down for lunch?
[01:22:43.342 --> 01:22:45.542]  You see Grandpa doing both thumbs up.
[01:22:45.542 --> 01:22:47.983]  I mean, I think a lot of people use these mannerisms, don't they?
[01:22:47.983 --> 01:22:49.624]  But they make fun of the mannerisms.
[01:22:49.624 --> 01:22:55.926]  Because I caught myself coming in doing two thumbs up and just thought, hey, they're going to think you're ripping Trump off.
[01:22:55.926 --> 01:22:57.627]  Which, no, I mean, we're just all doing this together.
[01:22:57.627 --> 01:23:01.108]  Two thumbs up means, you know, this is muy bueno.
[01:23:01.108 --> 01:23:02.749]  Doesn't muy bueno mean really good in Spanish?
[01:23:05.175 --> 01:23:07.136]  And fuego means on fire, doesn't it?
[01:23:07.136 --> 01:23:15.659]  The point is, is that I got excited hearing that three-and-a-half-year-old intro liner of confronting Piers Morgan.
[01:23:15.659 --> 01:23:22.321]  And I said, listen, you try to take our guns, you keep pushing, 1776 will commence again, the Republic will rise again.
[01:23:22.321 --> 01:23:24.142]  Well, we just did it peacefully.
[01:23:24.142 --> 01:23:27.623]  It's rising again!
[01:23:27.623 --> 01:23:29.604]  Getting Trump inaugurated was the baby being born.
[01:23:29.604 --> 01:23:32.085]  Getting him into office was the baby starting to crawl.
[01:23:32.938 --> 01:23:37.705]  The baby now is about 6 feet tall and 18 years old.
[01:23:37.705 --> 01:23:41.349]  And it's about to really start kicking some butt.
[01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:44.734]  Because it's got a young man's brain and an old man's heart.
[01:23:44.734 --> 01:23:46.516]  Took 18 years to get this far.
[01:23:47.819 --> 01:23:58.669]  That's why they're really scared right now, because I'd say four years into this, this relaunch of the Trumpian age, it'll be about 40 years old.
[01:23:58.669 --> 01:24:02.132]  A man in his prime, in that cycle.
[01:24:02.132 --> 01:24:08.377]  I'd say Trump gets re-elected, he's 45 years old, politically, in that cycle.
[01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:12.581]  And then he gets the other four years and delivers, it'll be the old statesman.
[01:24:13.663 --> 01:24:18.146]  The George Washington Part 2 to hand the baton, legend.
[01:24:18.146 --> 01:24:19.828]  That's why I said Trump's so real.
[01:24:19.828 --> 01:24:24.591]  Even from a sociopathic perspective, which he isn't, but if he was, his name's tied to this.
[01:24:24.591 --> 01:24:27.353]  Everything is on the line now to deliver.
[01:24:27.353 --> 01:24:33.318]  And they say, when people go sideways or try to change a bill or don't do what he's been pushing, he will start screaming.
[01:24:34.956 --> 01:24:37.697]  And saying, you are a traitor, you are scum, what is your problem?
[01:24:37.697 --> 01:24:39.917]  We're going to commit, we're going to deliver.
[01:24:39.917 --> 01:24:40.678]  Is that clear?
[01:24:40.678 --> 01:24:45.979]  I will fire you right now, and I will go out there to the cameras, and I will tell people what a traitor you are!
[01:24:45.979 --> 01:24:47.480]  Do you understand that?
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.220]  Behind the scenes, folks, Trump's just like this.
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:53.241]  He's just, for consumption, doesn't act like it.
[01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:55.942]  Because that's how you get stuff done, but only when you have to.
[01:24:55.942 --> 01:24:59.223]  I was going to get to Grassley, but now I'm ranting.
[01:24:59.223 --> 01:25:00.223]  I'll have to get to more Grassley.
[01:25:00.223 --> 01:25:00.903]  It's powerful.
[01:25:00.903 --> 01:25:01.864]  We're going to play the Grassley today.
[01:25:01.864 --> 01:25:03.004]  I haven't gotten to the powerful part yet.
[01:25:05.034 --> 01:25:09.736]  It's just that Trump knows he's all tied up in you winning.
[01:25:09.736 --> 01:25:12.257]  It's all in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:12.257 --> 01:25:13.897]  Does it mean his perspective's perfect?
[01:25:13.897 --> 01:25:14.938]  Does it mean he'll get it all done?
[01:25:14.938 --> 01:25:15.938]  No.
[01:25:15.938 --> 01:25:16.919]  The vaccine stuff.
[01:25:16.919 --> 01:25:23.461]  They appointed a pro-vaccine guy who's even pushed forced inoculation to head up the Centers for Disease Control.
[01:25:23.461 --> 01:25:26.642]  Now, that's a small part of the CDC's operation.
[01:25:26.642 --> 01:25:28.703]  But still, where's the committee?
[01:25:28.703 --> 01:25:29.683]  Where's the commission?
[01:25:29.683 --> 01:25:31.964]  Where's Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?
[01:25:31.964 --> 01:25:33.525]  Trump is not delivering on that.
[01:25:34.895 --> 01:25:42.768]  If I was in a fist fight and they land two blows and I land 15 blows, I'm not going to say I'm doing a bad job.
[01:25:42.768 --> 01:25:43.770]  It's the same thing with Trump.
[01:25:43.770 --> 01:25:45.733]  He can't land every blow.
[01:25:45.733 --> 01:25:46.855]  He's not Superman.
[01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:53.653]  Ladies and gentlemen, he just pulled us out of the UN, UNESCO.
[01:25:53.653 --> 01:25:55.974]  People are like, oh, he's wasting all the land out west.
[01:25:55.974 --> 01:25:56.995]  He doesn't care.
[01:25:56.995 --> 01:25:59.136]  He's stealing our public lands.
[01:25:59.136 --> 01:26:07.261]  They take your land out of use in areas where they already had logging and they already had mining and we're doing it safely.
[01:26:07.261 --> 01:26:10.422]  So that globalist investments and Chinese investments go up.
[01:26:10.422 --> 01:26:14.945]  Why do you think the Chinese have 97% of rare earth mineral extraction worldwide?
[01:26:16.479 --> 01:26:20.283]  Because they don't follow any rules, and they buy off governments, and they don't care.
[01:26:20.283 --> 01:26:20.904]  And the U.S.
[01:26:20.904 --> 01:26:25.328]  has ended rare earth mineral extraction effectively.
[01:26:25.328 --> 01:26:28.552]  I mean, we don't have one lead mine.
[01:26:28.552 --> 01:26:30.674]  They've shut down most of the gold mines.
[01:26:30.674 --> 01:26:32.756]  We're a joke!
[01:26:32.756 --> 01:26:35.039]  You can't have a country if you don't turn the resources on.
[01:26:36.115 --> 01:26:38.556]  So, they tell you, oh, he just reversed two monuments.
[01:26:38.556 --> 01:26:39.676]  He better reverse all 18.
[01:26:39.676 --> 01:26:41.176]  I looked it up last night.
[01:26:41.176 --> 01:26:48.498]  Obama designated 18 areas, wilderness or monument areas, and took something like 20 million acres out of use.
[01:26:48.498 --> 01:26:50.838]  I mean, that is ridiculous.
[01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:53.499]  The Feds already have more than half the West.
[01:26:53.499 --> 01:26:54.319]  In many states, over 80%.
[01:26:54.319 --> 01:26:54.699]  What do you need, 95%?
[01:26:54.699 --> 01:26:55.920]  In fact, in Utah, it took it from, what, 88% to over 90%.
[01:27:03.106 --> 01:27:04.186]  And shut down.
[01:27:04.186 --> 01:27:08.748]  Folks, they go, oh, we designated Yellowstone a global biosphere back in the 90s.
[01:27:08.748 --> 01:27:09.508]  Clinton did it.
[01:27:09.508 --> 01:27:11.929]  There was a gold mine 54 miles away.
[01:27:11.929 --> 01:27:12.669]  I visited it.
[01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:13.909]  I covered it.
[01:27:13.909 --> 01:27:15.670]  That they shut down.
[01:27:15.670 --> 01:27:17.711]  Saying, oh, you're now in the park.
[01:27:17.711 --> 01:27:19.131]  They're like, we're not in a park.
[01:27:19.131 --> 01:27:20.452]  No one even can get here.
[01:27:20.452 --> 01:27:21.392]  There's one road in here.
[01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:25.131]  There it is, just from a couple years ago.
[01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:27.612]  No, that was actually at the end of his term.
[01:27:27.612 --> 01:27:28.432]  This was earlier this year.
[01:27:28.432 --> 01:27:31.994]  Obama's last minute land grabs, only the tip of the presidential excess.
[01:27:31.994 --> 01:27:33.815]  There it is, the hill.
[01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:39.818]  All Trump did was say, look, the latest stuff you grabbed, Pac-Man, isn't yours.
[01:27:39.818 --> 01:27:41.959]  Comprende?
[01:27:41.959 --> 01:27:43.560]  Again, I just don't find any fault in Trump.
[01:27:45.265 --> 01:27:46.025]  There it is.
[01:27:46.025 --> 01:27:48.306]  Trump's rolling back Obama's last-minute land grab.
[01:27:48.306 --> 01:27:49.467]  Here's what must come next.
[01:27:49.467 --> 01:27:55.229]  But the way the media spun this, I had conservative friends come up to me and go, hey, your buddy Trump's stealing the public's land.
[01:27:55.229 --> 01:27:59.891]  Oh, all because they said that, oh, Trump took your public land?
[01:27:59.891 --> 01:28:03.773]  The feds aren't even letting people four-wheel or fish on most of this now.
[01:28:03.773 --> 01:28:06.394]  Trump just kicked it back to the states.
[01:28:06.394 --> 01:28:10.876]  Or back to BLM so they can't say it's a monument so you can go on it.
[01:28:10.876 --> 01:28:13.517]  All he did was say you can go on the land!
[01:28:15.322 --> 01:28:17.324]  And again, it's not even about defending Trump.
[01:28:17.324 --> 01:28:18.925]  I am sick of the ignorance.
[01:28:18.925 --> 01:28:20.547]  I'm sick of doing my homework.
[01:28:20.547 --> 01:28:27.213]  I'm sick of being informed and having everybody else it seems around me just believe whatever crap comes out of the mainstream media.
[01:28:27.213 --> 01:28:32.297]  I gotta tell you, it's refreshing to see Trump is like sickeningly on target.
[01:28:32.297 --> 01:28:36.281]  It's like a 71-year-old billionaire Alex Jones in office.
[01:28:37.463 --> 01:28:42.085]  And all you're getting is prosperity, all you're getting is Americana, and do I like it?
[01:28:42.085 --> 01:28:43.506]  You better believe I like it!
[01:28:43.506 --> 01:28:44.687]  Woo!
[01:28:44.687 --> 01:28:46.428]  Ha ha!
[01:28:46.428 --> 01:28:48.289]  Ha ha!
[01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:48.809]  Woo!
[01:28:48.809 --> 01:28:50.470]  But the globalists are mad.
[01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:52.431]  They're gonna strike back.
[01:28:56.949 --> 01:29:00.070]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:01.611]  Big Berkey Water Filters!
[01:29:01.611 --> 01:29:03.531]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[01:29:03.531 --> 01:29:08.193]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[01:29:08.193 --> 01:29:11.754]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:29:12.034 --> 01:29:15.758]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:29:15.758 --> 01:29:21.305]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:29:21.305 --> 01:29:25.309]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[01:29:25.309 --> 01:29:30.315]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[01:29:30.695 --> 01:29:37.316]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[01:29:44.398 --> 01:29:45.318]  That's 877-99-BER-K-E-Y.
[01:29:45.318 --> 01:29:46.598]  Gift well this Christmas.
[01:29:46.598 --> 01:29:48.259]  Give a Big Berkey Water Filter!

[01:31:59.701 --> 01:32:04.364]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:32:04.364 --> 01:32:05.885]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[01:32:06.943 --> 01:32:11.587]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:32:11.587 --> 01:32:13.909]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:32:13.909 --> 01:32:15.690]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:32:15.690 --> 01:32:20.974]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:32:20.974 --> 01:32:23.296]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[01:32:23.296 --> 01:32:28.941]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:32:28.941 --> 01:32:29.341]  Secret 12.
[01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:30.102]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:32:30.382 --> 01:32:31.143]  We're good to go.
[01:32:57.981 --> 01:33:08.524]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.524 --> 01:33:10.665]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:10.665 --> 01:33:13.045]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.334 --> 01:33:36.523]  Alright, two days ago, I got a call from the Secret Service, and they were saying they want to work out of town to come visit with me.
[01:33:39.301 --> 01:33:44.302]  In the next few days, and I'm not going to get into when that's going to be happening, but working on that right now.
[01:33:44.302 --> 01:33:48.263]  And they said, yeah, no, we got called from the senior folks in D.C.
[01:33:48.263 --> 01:33:50.084]  who read the pieces in the Washington Times.
[01:33:50.084 --> 01:33:55.705]  They mentioned some other sites where I was laying out that they're openly saying they want to kill the president.
[01:33:55.705 --> 01:33:57.545]  And they said, what all do you know about this?
[01:33:57.545 --> 01:33:58.626]  And I said, it's on television.
[01:33:58.626 --> 01:34:04.227]  You've got the former head of the CIA saying we're going to remove him outside of impeachment extrajudicially.
[01:34:05.077 --> 01:34:15.065]  That tends to mean rendition or killing, on the Aspen Institute, and Brennan was there with Clapper and they both nodded their heads with Will Blitzer.
[01:34:15.065 --> 01:34:28.036]  Then I said Phil Mudd, former head of counter-terrorism in the CIA, that's direct action, and then deputy director of the FBI under Mueller, said we're going to kill the president soon.
[01:34:29.502 --> 01:34:31.063]  You got the hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:34:31.063 --> 01:34:34.546]  We've got them canvassing Republicans saying that they're soon going to be gone.
[01:34:34.546 --> 01:34:39.250]  I do have sources I can't reveal there, but I can call those members of Congress if you'd like to talk to them.
[01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:40.951]  And so that's all being worked out right now.
[01:34:40.951 --> 01:34:43.874]  And the Secret Service said they are been directed.
[01:34:44.707 --> 01:34:48.669]  To investigate my analysis of this.
[01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:53.352]  Notice the media hadn't picked up on this in two days because they want to make fun of it and all this stuff.
[01:34:53.352 --> 01:34:55.453]  Then they know it'll get more attention.
[01:34:55.453 --> 01:34:57.194]  Because they know they've been wanting to kill the president.
[01:34:57.194 --> 01:35:00.076]  They know they've been pushing it and hyping it and all the rest of it.
[01:35:00.076 --> 01:35:01.497]  And they know that we've collated it.
[01:35:02.137 --> 01:35:13.087]  And show them when they talk about the succession and COG and how he needs to die and the New York Times and CNN and all these hosts talking about it and saying the guy that shot Congressman Scalise was a good guy.
[01:35:13.087 --> 01:35:15.169]  That was also on Wolf Blitzer.
[01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:17.751]  You know, he wasn't a terrorist.
[01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:18.552]  He wasn't a bad guy.
[01:35:18.552 --> 01:35:20.673]  He was mad about what's happening politically.
[01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:22.795]  I mean, there's so many examples of it.
[01:35:22.795 --> 01:35:23.296]  It's crazy.
[01:35:23.296 --> 01:35:27.439]  They're trying to hype somebody up to do it, but they're also trying to telegraph their strong.
[01:35:28.775 --> 01:35:31.378]  And that they can remove the president.
[01:35:31.378 --> 01:35:40.306]  And of course that's now come out out of the whole CIA groups that are being quoted in major newspapers.
[01:35:40.306 --> 01:35:47.673]  First picked up by the Intercept that indeed they've got large groups of the CIA direct action guarding the president since he was president-elect.
[01:35:48.414 --> 01:36:00.361]  Uh, and surveilling it, and they've got what they call the tinfoil room, where they travel around with the President watching everybody, including the Secret Service, the FBI, because we know the globals have moles in those groups.
[01:36:00.361 --> 01:36:03.463]  So, we've always known about those organizations and groups.
[01:36:03.463 --> 01:36:04.403]  In fact, a lot of it's not known.
[01:36:04.403 --> 01:36:06.865]  I'm not going to get into it, just because we've been involved since day one.
[01:36:06.865 --> 01:36:10.367]  Uh, but that's what's going on, and that's what's happening.
[01:36:11.067 --> 01:36:16.969]  And so it's been taken very serious because there's been a move to get rid of the president by Christmas.
[01:36:16.969 --> 01:36:22.791]  They've been so arrogant they've telegraphed it to look powerful to other operatives in their criminal network in the deep state.
[01:36:22.791 --> 01:36:24.691]  But it's not one monolithic deep state.
[01:36:24.691 --> 01:36:26.712]  So I want to get Matt Bracken on, he's a great strategist.
[01:36:27.512 --> 01:36:44.684]  Uh, to give us his take on this, and now that the Mueller thing's falling apart, and it really is, I mean, it's a house of cards, now that everybody's turning on him, now that everybody knows that it was a cover-up for Hillary, who they thought they'd be president, they are putting everything they've got together now on the dementia, the 25th Amendment, that's failing.
[01:36:44.684 --> 01:36:47.205]  So they're failing, the only option they've got is Plan C.
[01:36:48.226 --> 01:36:51.751]  And so, they've already canvassed Congress and said he's gonna be gone soon.
[01:36:51.751 --> 01:36:55.595]  When we get rid of him, you just don't do anything and we won't get you next.
[01:36:55.595 --> 01:36:57.778]  Well, Congress is smart enough to know it'll be them next.
[01:36:58.584 --> 01:37:04.026]  Just like the Soviets took over in 1917, or the Nazis got rid of the SA first and out of the long knives.
[01:37:04.026 --> 01:37:08.848]  I mean, if you believe that, like, we're going to leave you alone when we take out Trump, but you need to stand down when we do.
[01:37:08.848 --> 01:37:10.568]  I've gotten those phone calls, okay?
[01:37:10.568 --> 01:37:12.589]  And yes, I've related them to the Secret Service.
[01:37:12.589 --> 01:37:14.409]  This isn't a game, this is the real world.
[01:37:14.409 --> 01:37:18.631]  Everybody knows we predict things ahead of time, because we're not predicting it, we have the sources.
[01:37:18.631 --> 01:37:20.351]  Because we're crazy enough to put it out.
[01:37:20.351 --> 01:37:21.272]  We're fearless.
[01:37:21.932 --> 01:37:22.533]  We're not fearless.
[01:37:22.533 --> 01:37:25.275]  We realize if we're not fearless, we're going to lose.
[01:37:25.275 --> 01:37:27.076]  So we're afraid of losing, so we're fearless.
[01:37:27.076 --> 01:37:27.937]  Get that, folks?
[01:37:27.937 --> 01:37:31.781]  So Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert, can also speak about the Israel thing.
[01:37:31.781 --> 01:37:33.722]  That's where he did a lot of his work.
[01:37:33.722 --> 01:37:35.083]  You just heard my analysis.
[01:37:35.083 --> 01:37:38.226]  What would you like to say to the Secret Service about what's going on?
[01:37:38.226 --> 01:37:39.567]  I know you've read this stuff as well.
[01:37:39.567 --> 01:37:40.948]  What's your analysis?
[01:37:40.948 --> 01:37:42.750]  What do you expect them to throw at Trump right now?
[01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:47.214]  Do you agree that the wheels have completely come off their BS Russia fantasy?
[01:37:48.652 --> 01:37:50.293]  No doubt.
[01:37:50.293 --> 01:37:59.717]  This is bureaucratic Operation Valkyrie, just like the movie or the World War II deal with the attempt to take out Hitler.
[01:37:59.717 --> 01:38:07.260]  The coup plotters, they have the media still, so they're broadcasting that the new government is in charge in Berlin.
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:11.082]  But even as they're talking, the doors are being broken down.
[01:38:11.862 --> 01:38:15.624]  This morning, Jim Jordan, he had the most explosive testimony.
[01:38:15.624 --> 01:38:31.251]  Actually, he was asking it in the form of a question to Ray, which Ray refused to answer, which was, did the assassin, the political assassin, Strzok, did he, was he the fusion GPS cutout that gave the dirty dossier to the FISA court?
[01:38:32.525 --> 01:38:38.427]  He wasn't thrown out just over some emails, some texts to his girlfriend, Ms.
[01:38:38.427 --> 01:38:39.427]  Page.
[01:38:39.427 --> 01:38:40.087]  That's not it.
[01:38:40.087 --> 01:38:41.588]  That's the cover story.
[01:38:41.588 --> 01:38:44.028]  Jordan wouldn't have said that if he didn't know it.
[01:38:44.028 --> 01:38:45.989]  He was just putting it on the record today.
[01:38:45.989 --> 01:39:00.933]  So I would assume 95% certainty, Strzok was the guy that delivered the dirty dossier to the FISA court to use that, to leverage that into the intelligence community surveilling the Trump campaign, and then the
[01:39:01.613 --> 01:39:01.853]  Thank you.
[01:39:13.495 --> 01:39:28.745]  The only thing that they've got left after this, the Mueller-Comey Operation Valkyrie is falling apart, is to signal to the crazy people, the minions out there, to try to do something to take Trump out directly because he's such a crazy person, such a threat.
[01:39:28.745 --> 01:39:38.732]  And I'll remind people, Anwar Sadat and Indira Gandhi were both assassinated by people in uniform, you know, with government-issued guns.
[01:39:39.492 --> 01:39:45.036]  Indira Gandhi was killed by, they were Sikhs actually, but they were her most trusted bodyguards.
[01:39:45.036 --> 01:39:50.741]  And by the way, since day one, Trump's known that, and that's why he's had his own, let's just say, special security that nobody sees.
[01:39:51.626 --> 01:40:18.318]  One of the biggest stories of the last year and most underreported, amazing bombshell story, is that the Garland, Texas, Draw Muhammad event, which had Geert Wilders, Pam Geller, and Robert Spencer there, an FBI special agent was accompanying the assassins from Arizona to the Garland, Texas, event, was in the car behind them, texting them, tear up Texas!
[01:40:19.033 --> 01:40:20.713]  He wasn't there to stop them.
[01:40:20.713 --> 01:40:25.855]  He was there probably to, like, in case they got pulled over by local cops to make sure they weren't impeded.
[01:40:25.855 --> 01:40:29.935]  He fled when the security guard killed the Jihad assassins.
[01:40:29.935 --> 01:40:31.856]  He was an FBI special agent.
[01:40:31.856 --> 01:40:34.856]  That's who they've been hiring for the last 10 years.
[01:40:34.856 --> 01:40:40.518]  You can't assume that somebody with a federal badge isn't a crazy social justice warrior.
[01:40:40.518 --> 01:40:41.638]  That's who they've been hiring.
[01:40:41.698 --> 01:40:55.786]  Well yeah, look at Reality Winner, literally joined ISIS, hated all white people who know she was white, completely bonkers, and they had her in a very high level top security clearance, and they have just flooded the government with complete lunatics, and you're right.
[01:40:55.786 --> 01:41:08.193]  That's going to be their move, is activating their mental patients inside, we're not saying the whole Secret Service is bad or the FBI, or a cook at the White House, but this is definitely what we're facing.
[01:41:08.846 --> 01:41:10.947]  They're signaling to the lunatics.
[01:41:10.947 --> 01:41:19.433]  While I got a minute, I have to mention, in 1979, on this day, Buds Class 105 graduated.
[01:41:19.433 --> 01:41:20.433]  That's why I'm wearing this today.
[01:41:20.433 --> 01:41:22.134]  Hooyah 105!
[01:41:22.134 --> 01:41:24.816]  Hooyah all frogmen, all SEALs, all UDT.
[01:41:24.816 --> 01:41:29.739]  It's the best bunch of guys I was ever associated with in my entire life.
[01:41:29.739 --> 01:41:35.903]  And I just wanted to say that there are a lot more great, loyal patriots out there, not just the frogmen.
[01:41:36.383 --> 01:41:49.090]  Special Forces, Rangers, up and down the military that take their oath very seriously to protect the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:41:49.090 --> 01:41:59.495]  And if something like this happens, whether it's Mueller and Comey's Operation Valkyrie coup, or them triggering a maniac to try to take Trump out,
[01:42:00.095 --> 01:42:07.183]  It won't work, guys, because if that ever happened, thousands of people would take up their arms, and we know who the traitors are.
[01:42:07.183 --> 01:42:14.512]  There wouldn't be any huge plot, it wouldn't be like marching on Washington, but the traitors would be swinging from lampposts, I guarantee you.
[01:42:14.932 --> 01:42:21.174]  Well I think they realize that and suddenly I'm seeing Democrats and even the Democrats on Fox News turn against Hillary and Comey.
[01:42:21.174 --> 01:42:23.295]  It just happened in the last 24 hours.
[01:42:23.295 --> 01:42:26.296]  They know even more is about to come out and here's the big breaking news.
[01:42:26.296 --> 01:42:27.256]  We'll hit when we come back.
[01:42:27.256 --> 01:42:32.938]  It's not just Strzok and all these other FBI agents they know that they're holding back on because they don't want to quote, hurt the agency too bad.
[01:42:33.778 --> 01:42:34.359]  I can confirm.
[01:42:34.359 --> 01:42:36.841]  They've got bombshell stuff far worse than this.
[01:42:36.841 --> 01:42:40.964]  Top DOJ official demoted amid probe of contacts with Trump.
[01:42:40.964 --> 01:42:45.248]  That's Bruce G. O. H. R. or he has been removed.
[01:42:45.248 --> 01:42:46.389]  So it's beginning.
[01:42:46.389 --> 01:42:50.172]  They're removing the Clinton Stay Behind Network.
[01:42:50.172 --> 01:42:53.134]  The Clinton Foundation Crime Network is being removed right now.

[01:46:00.212 --> 01:46:14.816]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:46:14.816 --> 01:46:22.379]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:22.919 --> 01:46:27.842]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[01:46:27.842 --> 01:46:30.804]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[01:46:30.804 --> 01:46:34.066]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:34.066 --> 01:46:40.229]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:42.751]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.

[01:46:58.285 --> 01:47:00.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.157 --> 01:47:13.517]  Some heads are gonna roll.
[01:47:13.517 --> 01:47:16.238]  And they're starting to roll.
[01:47:16.238 --> 01:47:19.659]  And we're there as the sentinels.
[01:47:19.659 --> 01:47:20.379]  Not saints.
[01:47:20.379 --> 01:47:24.440]  We're just people that look from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.960]  We live in a free country.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.480]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.781]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:29.781 --> 01:47:31.701]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:47:31.701 --> 01:47:34.222]  From the InfoWars.com studios.
[01:47:37.045 --> 01:47:38.866]  We are seeing history happen right now.
[01:47:38.866 --> 01:47:40.907]  We are seeing the president deliver.
[01:47:40.907 --> 01:47:48.611]  We're seeing CNN have to admit he's done everything he said he'd do, and the other stuff he's starting to get done.
[01:47:48.611 --> 01:47:51.253]  And now their whole Russia investigation, as we knew, is a fraud.
[01:47:51.253 --> 01:47:54.755]  I mean, they're calling me a Russian agent and saying they have proof, but never showing it.
[01:47:54.755 --> 01:47:57.776]  I mean, it's like telling me, again, I'm a space alien.
[01:47:57.776 --> 01:47:58.777]  I don't even know I am one.
[01:47:58.777 --> 01:48:00.218]  I mean, if I am one, I didn't know it.
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.342]  It's crazy.
[01:48:03.342 --> 01:48:07.366]  And now their whole globalist operation's in trouble.
[01:48:07.366 --> 01:48:09.388]  They clearly wanted to get Hillary in as president.
[01:48:09.388 --> 01:48:13.052]  They thought that she was going to win so they could commit all the crimes they wanted.
[01:48:13.052 --> 01:48:17.837]  And they fought so hard and so recklessly because they're afraid Trump will go after them for what they've done.
[01:48:17.837 --> 01:48:20.039]  He was willing to leave them alone and let them settle off in the sunset.
[01:48:21.323 --> 01:48:22.804]  But they tried to destroy Trump.
[01:48:22.804 --> 01:48:24.506]  They tried to destroy me and Drudge.
[01:48:24.506 --> 01:48:25.567]  They're having hearings.
[01:48:25.567 --> 01:48:26.767]  They're censoring us right now.
[01:48:26.767 --> 01:48:29.890]  I mean, we're starting to win, but the battle is still raging.
[01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:36.796]  I want to talk to Matt Bracken about where he sees this going and other things that we need to watch out for.
[01:48:36.796 --> 01:48:39.398]  He's a great anti-terrorism expert and best-selling author.
[01:48:39.398 --> 01:48:42.861]  He's got a new book out he's put out for free in The Information War.
[01:48:42.861 --> 01:48:49.266]  But briefly, ladies and gentlemen, I want to encourage all of the listeners to go to Infowarstore.com
[01:48:51.317 --> 01:48:53.600]  And get our latest product.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.562]  We've launched several new products.
[01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:56.684]  Great probiotics.
[01:48:56.684 --> 01:49:01.750]  We've launched a digestive enzyme spectrum that one of the top companies in the U.S.
[01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:05.655]  developed that helps you get more nutrients and absorb proteins and fats better.
[01:49:07.034 --> 01:49:12.679]  That's the Carnivore product, but Alpha Power is targeted at men, but it's for women as well.
[01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:31.314]  And it has LJ100 as the most potent, highest quality, and most studied extract in the category, which is boosts sports performance, increases physical and mental energy, helps maintain normal, high free testosterone levels in men, boosts healthy alpha pheromones, and more.
[01:49:31.314 --> 01:49:35.258]  Improves sleep quality, encourages prostate health, helps support healthy cholesterol levels.
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:42.085]  Again, it makes you awake when you take it, but then it makes you sleepy when it's time in your regular cycle.
[01:49:42.085 --> 01:49:45.128]  And let me tell you something.
[01:49:45.128 --> 01:49:47.551]  It's 50 times stronger than leading competitors.
[01:49:47.551 --> 01:49:48.952]  We can actually say that.
[01:49:48.952 --> 01:49:51.775]  Because we went out and got the LJ100 and all the other stuff that's in it.
[01:49:51.775 --> 01:49:53.437]  It's ridiculous.
[01:49:53.437 --> 01:49:54.498]  So, if you like...
[01:49:56.178 --> 01:49:56.538]  I think so.
[01:50:15.146 --> 01:50:17.727]  But I'm telling you, it's all seen as generally safe.
[01:50:17.727 --> 01:50:19.748]  We can make a lot of claims about it.
[01:50:19.748 --> 01:50:22.429]  There's nothing out there like it.
[01:50:22.429 --> 01:50:25.370]  There's crap out there that's not even as strong for $100.
[01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:26.750]  So it normally is $69.
[01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:28.971]  It's inexpensive.
[01:50:28.971 --> 01:50:29.511]  It's $34.95.
[01:50:29.511 --> 01:50:32.152]  50% off out of the gate, even though it cost me a lot to produce this.
[01:50:32.152 --> 01:50:38.115]  I mean, we're talking tens of thousands of dollars per kilo of just the LJ100.
[01:50:40.054 --> 01:50:44.957]  Versus other people that just get the crap stuff that they, from the herb, but it's not even as strong.
[01:50:44.957 --> 01:50:46.158]  It's 50 times weaker.
[01:50:46.158 --> 01:50:50.881]  So again, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:50:50.881 --> 01:50:56.164]  I didn't get into all the maca root and the horny goat weed and the tribulus and everything else.
[01:50:56.164 --> 01:50:58.005]  I mean, I didn't mention the libido part.
[01:50:58.005 --> 01:50:58.966]  That's what everybody really notices.
[01:50:59.406 --> 01:51:04.910]  Infowarslife.com, we got 50% off on our high-quality non-fluoride toothpaste, Super Blue, and a lot more.
[01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:08.272]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:51:08.272 --> 01:51:18.218]  And if you shop with us for Christmas, you get great products, give yourself the gift of freedom, and know that you're forging this weapons system to an even greater level.
[01:51:18.218 --> 01:51:28.465]  In the fires of Festus, in the fires of Vulcan, you know, under the volcano here, we are forging weapons of truth against lies, and it is you that is financing it all.
[01:51:29.571 --> 01:51:40.499]  Now, Matt Bracken, it's incredible you raised this, and I want to also get into your newest book that you put out free on Amazon, but also some of the books people should actually buy for Christmas and support your great work and wake folks up as well.
[01:51:40.499 --> 01:51:48.785]  Because a lot of people aren't political, but they'll read an exciting novel, like the novels you write and James Wesley Rawls writes.
[01:51:48.785 --> 01:51:50.126]  We'll talk about some of those as well.
[01:51:50.126 --> 01:51:52.408]  I'll get you back soon just on the novels, but first,
[01:51:55.302 --> 01:52:09.273]  Matt Bracken, without me even bringing it up earlier, compared the attempts to overthrow Trump, not with his fake investigations, but winding up crazies to kill him, and saying he'll soon be assassinated or soon be gone, with Operation Valkyrie, and what happened in World War II, and that's the parallel.
[01:52:09.273 --> 01:52:19.942]  And I noticed that Obama just came out yesterday, it's on DrugsReport.com, it's an Infowars.com article, Paul Joseph Watson, Obama warns Trump will lead America into genocide, like Hitler,
[01:52:21.337 --> 01:52:26.221]  Obama compares Trump to Hitler, implies America like the 1930s Nazi Germany.
[01:52:26.221 --> 01:52:30.444]  Yeah, so Hitler let the Jews go to Israel or whatever and help?
[01:52:30.444 --> 01:52:32.806]  I mean, this is crazy, folks.
[01:52:32.806 --> 01:52:36.449]  Who's Hitlerian is the National Socialist and the Democratic Party.
[01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:39.011]  They're the ones that act like thugs, beating everybody up.
[01:52:39.011 --> 01:52:41.272]  So, that ties into what you were saying earlier.
[01:52:42.233 --> 01:52:53.277]  What do you make of Obama invokes Hitler saying that Trump is basically Hitler and is undemocratic when they're the ones trying to kick out an elected president?
[01:52:53.277 --> 01:52:58.659]  I would say that this is the same as people encouraging an assassination of Trump.
[01:52:58.659 --> 01:53:08.303]  What Obama is trying to do without coming directly out and saying it is calling for like a massive intifada against Trump and against Europeans in general.
[01:53:10.032 --> 01:53:14.201]  I think that they see the wheels coming off of the Mueller coup plot.
[01:53:15.221 --> 01:53:23.844]  And I think that what we're going to see in the next few days with that is Mueller will say that there's really no more charges that he can find.
[01:53:23.844 --> 01:53:27.745]  They'll proceed against Flynn, but very minimal results.
[01:53:27.745 --> 01:53:29.266]  They're going to try to wind it down.
[01:53:29.266 --> 01:53:32.287]  And if anything, Comey will be left out to dry.
[01:53:32.287 --> 01:53:38.109]  What's the deal that Mueller is going to make for self-preservation is to blame Comey for all the leaks.
[01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:41.030]  So Comey is going to be the big leaker and take the fall.
[01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:44.071]  Comey is going to go into the reservoir tied to the anchor.
[01:53:44.745 --> 01:53:48.969]  So people are right now trying to make their own their own deals.
[01:53:48.969 --> 01:53:57.538]  Obama calling, you know, basically saying Trump is Hitler is the same as if Trump is Hitler, then you're justified in killing Trump.
[01:53:57.538 --> 01:54:01.361]  That's a classic, you know, sociology question.
[01:54:01.361 --> 01:54:04.845]  If you knew that you had a baby Hitler, would you strangle him in the crib?
[01:54:05.966 --> 01:54:09.089]  So, that's what Obama's trying to do, but it's too late.
[01:54:09.089 --> 01:54:11.332]  The coup has already passed.
[01:54:11.332 --> 01:54:14.655]  Tom Cruise is still in the building, but he's got no more phones.
[01:54:14.655 --> 01:54:17.659]  They just cut off his phone service.
[01:54:17.659 --> 01:54:24.206]  I did want to mention, it's a total coincidence, this week I put all my books on a Kindle free run.
[01:54:24.206 --> 01:54:26.048]  This one is free today, Castigo Key.
[01:54:26.949 --> 01:54:36.374]  But it's all leading up, the whole reason I'm doing it, this is my counter-jihad novel, The Red Cliffs of Zerhoun, and I want British people in particular to download and read this book.
[01:54:36.374 --> 01:54:38.655]  It'll be free tomorrow and Saturday.
[01:54:38.655 --> 01:54:46.520]  So these books are free, well, they were free the rest of the week, but today it's this one, tomorrow and Saturday, Red Cliffs.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:52.203]  It's a counter-jihad novel, I don't care how many people download it, the more the better, it'll cost nothing, just go and click.
[01:54:52.899 --> 01:54:55.740]  Anyway, we are in a war right now.
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:01.501]  I see the Jerusalem move as Trump putting his chips into the counter-jihad side.
[01:55:01.501 --> 01:55:04.922]  This is a huge pushback against Mueller and the rest of the world.
[01:55:04.922 --> 01:55:05.322]  That's right.
[01:55:05.322 --> 01:55:06.983]  It's beyond calling a bluff.
[01:55:06.983 --> 01:55:09.504]  It's saying we recognize Israel.
[01:55:09.504 --> 01:55:10.564]  Jihad is spreading.
[01:55:10.564 --> 01:55:11.984]  Islam is spreading all over the world.
[01:55:11.984 --> 01:55:14.005]  The green is spreading across the map.
[01:55:14.005 --> 01:55:15.445]  Christianity is shrinking.
[01:55:15.445 --> 01:55:17.206]  Europe's turned itself over to Islam.
[01:55:17.206 --> 01:55:17.906]  We're not doing it.
[01:55:18.909 --> 01:55:23.635]  And if you want to do a global infitada, bring it on.
[01:55:23.635 --> 01:55:33.286]  So instead of shrinking and saying, well, we don't want to upset the moderate Muslims, he's saying, Jerusalem's the capital, what are you going to do about it, punk?
[01:55:33.286 --> 01:55:34.808]  It's that kind of a move, literally.
[01:55:35.368 --> 01:55:47.197]  So, I would expect to see some, you know, spectacular terrorist events this Christmas, you know, truck attacks, things like that, even though they've got the Allahu Akbar-iers up all over Europe.
[01:55:47.197 --> 01:55:50.960]  You can't go to a Christmas event in Europe that it doesn't look like a stalag.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:55.884]  You know, in terms of the security with metal detectors and jersey barricades all the way around.
[01:55:55.884 --> 01:56:03.709]  And they tell German women don't wear short skirts now, and expanding on that, Sweden wants to make it illegal to even say that a Muslim engages in a crime.
[01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:05.371]  In fact, they are making it illegal.
[01:56:05.371 --> 01:56:08.013]  And if you expand on that, look at Turkey.
[01:56:08.013 --> 01:56:10.355]  They claim they were moderate while they merged with Europe.
[01:56:10.355 --> 01:56:16.199]  Now, Erdogan leads the radical jihad movement and is saying, we're going to flood you with 50 million and take you over.
[01:56:16.199 --> 01:56:20.022]  I mean, Islam always does this friendly act until they get to a certain point.
[01:56:21.239 --> 01:56:24.261]  I think that this is coming to a boil now.
[01:56:24.261 --> 01:56:35.627]  Two years ago, I wrote a story comparing this coming global intifada to the Tet Uprising, and I think I was early on in my timing, but I still think that it's coming.
[01:56:35.627 --> 01:56:38.369]  In Europe, it's so blatant now.
[01:56:38.369 --> 01:56:43.712]  You can't go down the street without passing between anti-truck barricades.
[01:56:43.712 --> 01:56:49.475]  It's rather obvious why those anti-truck barricades are up, even if they try to dress them up like Christmas presents.
[01:56:49.895 --> 01:56:55.420]  You know, it's because of the Muslims that have come that are still full of, you know, jihad anger.
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:57:10.853]  They just, in between Trump retweeting the truthful videos of the, you know, the handicapped Dutch boy being beaten up, the teenager being thrown off a building, presumably homosexual, and the Virgin Mary statue being smashed.
[01:57:10.853 --> 01:57:12.434]  These were all real videos.
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:16.764]  The British elites, the Quislings, they went crazy.
[01:57:16.764 --> 01:57:19.968]  And then Theresa May has an assassination plot against her.
[01:57:20.743 --> 01:57:22.324]  You know, like the next day.
[01:57:22.324 --> 01:57:23.845]  A jihad assassination attempt.
[01:57:23.845 --> 01:57:30.150]  You know, you'd think these jihadis would get out of these hell holes they're in and show up somewhere like in Germany and everything's free or England.
[01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:31.011]  Here's a free house.
[01:57:31.011 --> 01:57:33.333]  Here, they're like, no, I'm gonna kill you.
[01:57:33.333 --> 01:57:35.935]  And I mean, it's just like, it's crazy town.
[01:57:35.935 --> 01:57:38.136]  It's absolute crazy town.
[01:57:38.136 --> 01:57:45.022]  It's like swimming in your swimming pool and putting 500 piranhas in it and slicing your leg with razor blades and jumping in and wondering why they attacked you.
[01:57:46.144 --> 01:57:50.765]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[01:59:49.158 --> 01:59:51.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.232 --> 02:00:26.281]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:37.594]  Stuff's gotten so crazy that I didn't even get into Obama saying Trump's Hitler and is going to commit genocide in America until an hour and 50 minutes into the show.
[02:00:37.594 --> 02:00:44.597]  And they just walked in here with breaking stacks of news from NewsWars.com and Infowars.com that are just crazy.
[02:00:44.597 --> 02:00:49.179]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author, researcher, we've got about four or five minutes left in this segment.
[02:00:49.179 --> 02:00:50.360]  You got cut off by the breaks.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.101]  I want to hear what it was you were trying to get to, but...
[02:00:53.703 --> 02:00:56.384]  I mean, you agree the globalists are getting routed all over the world.
[02:00:56.384 --> 02:00:57.944]  They're being exposed.
[02:00:57.944 --> 02:01:00.184]  Nationalism's rising.
[02:01:00.184 --> 02:01:05.585]  The globalists attempt to invade even more with radical Islam to accelerate that.
[02:01:05.585 --> 02:01:11.467]  I think finally even triggered good elements of the deep state to realize that this was make it or break it.
[02:01:11.467 --> 02:01:17.068]  And now the attempts to put everybody back under their control I think are going to backfire, Matt Rackin.
[02:01:17.068 --> 02:01:22.889]  So what else do you expect to happen as this war goes into overdrive and as Trump throws down the gauntlet?
[02:01:24.437 --> 02:01:30.139]  Well, what we see on the outside is probably days or weeks after it's really happening on the inside.
[02:01:30.139 --> 02:01:33.581]  And we sort of see the shadow of the pendulum moving.
[02:01:33.581 --> 02:01:38.262]  But today we saw Bruce Orr get fired at DOJ.
[02:01:38.262 --> 02:01:41.884]  Like you said, they're taking out the Obama stay-behinds.
[02:01:42.504 --> 02:01:55.042]  And some of these guys no doubt are going to be left in place having flipped and now they're going to be rounding up and this is a message to these guys what I'm saying now the ones that the stay behinds that have flipped
[02:01:55.592 --> 02:02:01.016]  Are now going to be collecting evidence against the more diehard coup plotters.
[02:02:01.016 --> 02:02:06.640]  This is a bureaucratic Operation Valkyrie and we're now seeing the end stages.
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:09.081]  It's fabulous watching history unfold.
[02:02:09.081 --> 02:02:19.669]  What Jim Jordan said this morning, I'm sure he didn't say it without cause, that Strzok, the guy who protected Hillary and then went after Trump, if he was the fusion GPS
[02:02:20.259 --> 02:02:24.242]  Dirty dossier man who used that to get a FISA warrant.
[02:02:24.242 --> 02:02:27.365]  This now is something that is going to be beyond Watergate.
[02:02:27.365 --> 02:02:35.991]  And it could be used for a real clean sweep and purge, which is going to take some doing because they've been hiring social justice warriors for 10 years.
[02:02:35.991 --> 02:02:43.677]  There's an entire cadre, an entire generation of federal employees that are basically Marxists.
[02:02:43.677 --> 02:02:47.240]  So it's going to be a continuing battle to find these guys and isolate them.
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:49.241]  But it's hopeful, finally.
[02:02:49.241 --> 02:02:51.363]  I mean, the plot is coming apart.
[02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:52.463]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:02:52.463 --> 02:02:55.085]  We're going to have that Jim Jordan clip coming up in the next segment.
[02:02:55.085 --> 02:02:57.427]  We have some more guests that are experts on this joining us.
[02:02:57.427 --> 02:02:59.748]  But this is an epic time to be alive.
[02:02:59.748 --> 02:03:04.932]  And by the way, when the Secret Service called me, it wasn't like, oh, Alex, give us your help when they're really investigating me.
[02:03:04.932 --> 02:03:05.933]  This was serious.
[02:03:05.933 --> 02:03:07.794]  This came from D.C.
[02:03:07.794 --> 02:03:10.296]  And they are looking at criminal investigations.
[02:03:10.296 --> 02:03:12.037]  They are looking at the plot.
[02:03:12.037 --> 02:03:13.378]  And they said, what else do you have?
[02:03:15.439 --> 02:03:21.422]  Ready to go talk to folks in Congress who've had the Democrats come and canvas them that, hey, we're taking your boss out.
[02:03:21.422 --> 02:03:22.383]  You want to work with us?
[02:03:22.383 --> 02:03:24.264]  I mean, they've really pushed it.
[02:03:24.264 --> 02:03:28.486]  And I think Trump's strong enough to not just leave him in the shadows now after they're defeated.
[02:03:28.486 --> 02:03:29.526]  They need to be fully routed.
[02:03:29.526 --> 02:03:30.787]  They need to all be arrested.
[02:03:30.787 --> 02:03:32.268]  And I think that's going to end up happening.
[02:03:32.268 --> 02:03:34.449]  I think now they don't want him to know that.
[02:03:34.449 --> 02:03:35.949]  So so they act even more violently.
[02:03:35.949 --> 02:03:38.751]  But I think we've passed the point of return here, Matt.
[02:03:39.915 --> 02:03:45.076]  Yeah, and that's why Trump very wisely did not fire Mueller.
[02:03:45.076 --> 02:03:54.259]  Firing Mueller, which would be his constitutional right, would have just played to the Democrats, led to, you know, calls for impeachment and so forth.
[02:03:54.259 --> 02:04:02.721]  Now watch for Mueller to begin backpedaling and saying, well, I'm winding up the investigation, basically meaning, please let me get out of town without handcuffs on.
[02:04:03.374 --> 02:04:09.198]  And if you need to arrest somebody as the leader of Operation Valkyrie, it's that guy Comey, the leaker.
[02:04:09.198 --> 02:04:17.804]  You know, I made that coup trap meme months ago with the four corners being Comey, Mueller, Rosenstein, and McCabe.
[02:04:17.804 --> 02:04:22.327]  And yesterday I added Strzok and Wiseman.
[02:04:22.327 --> 02:04:25.249]  But these are the ringleaders, and the whole world knows it.
[02:04:25.976 --> 02:04:27.797]  The whole world knows it.
[02:04:27.797 --> 02:04:29.238]  And they're working for the Clinton Foundation.
[02:04:29.238 --> 02:04:31.060]  They're all getting money from it.
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:32.421]  Uranium One.
[02:04:32.421 --> 02:04:33.761]  I mean, these guys are bold.
[02:04:33.761 --> 02:04:34.562]  I'll give them that, Matt.
[02:04:34.562 --> 02:04:36.223]  They are bold.
[02:04:36.223 --> 02:04:41.387]  Mueller has to watch out because he was on duty during the Uranium One himself.
[02:04:41.387 --> 02:04:45.129]  Oh yeah, he ended the investigation of the FBI.
[02:04:45.129 --> 02:04:46.070]  145 million.
[02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.630]  Absolutely.
[02:04:46.630 --> 02:04:48.011]  EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com.
[02:04:48.011 --> 02:04:48.852]  Matt Bracken.
[02:04:48.852 --> 02:04:49.472]  Always amazing.
[02:04:49.472 --> 02:04:49.813]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:55.390 --> 02:05:02.337]  President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel this week in a move that some say will shake the Middle East to the core.
[02:05:02.337 --> 02:05:05.581]  Israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with Trump's announcement.
[02:05:05.581 --> 02:05:11.087]  The Turkish president warned Trump that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a red line.
[02:05:11.087 --> 02:05:16.993]  The Saudis are calling this a flagrant provocation of Muslims and Palestinian leaders have already planned for protests.
[02:05:17.233 --> 02:05:29.301]  Terror group Hamas is calling for a day of rage Friday, urging Palestinians in an official Arabic statement to send a message with all available means to Israel after the upcoming Friday prayers.
[02:05:29.301 --> 02:05:31.463]  Ahead of President Trump's announcement, the U.S.
[02:05:31.463 --> 02:05:38.788]  military deployed additional forces throughout the Middle East in anticipation of widespread political unrest and even terror attacks.
[02:05:38.988 --> 02:05:39.808]  Although some U.S.
[02:05:39.808 --> 02:05:43.110]  officials had urged Trump not to make this sort of a move, U.S.
[02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:46.151]  policy should never be dictated by threats of violence.
[02:05:46.151 --> 02:05:52.133]  With the opposition against Trump's historic decision building, the days ahead could turn out to be tumultuous.
[02:05:52.133 --> 02:05:54.074]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[02:05:56.201 --> 02:05:57.462]  You've got it.
[02:05:57.462 --> 02:06:03.288]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:03.288 --> 02:06:07.652]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:07.652 --> 02:06:13.777]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:13.777 --> 02:06:17.300]  Biblical?
[02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:19.763]  What do you mean by biblical?
[02:06:21.204 --> 02:06:23.986]  I mean wrath of God type stuff.
[02:06:23.986 --> 02:06:25.406]  Fire and brimstone.
[02:06:25.406 --> 02:06:27.848]  The dead rising from the graves.
[02:06:27.848 --> 02:06:30.409]  Cats and dogs living together.
[02:06:30.409 --> 02:06:31.130]  Quote Ghostbusters.
[02:06:31.130 --> 02:06:33.291]  I'm going to paraphrase it.
[02:06:33.291 --> 02:06:34.211]  This is serious.
[02:06:34.211 --> 02:06:36.653]  Giant record fires all over California.
[02:06:36.653 --> 02:06:38.254]  Southern California.
[02:06:38.254 --> 02:06:40.895]  Satellite photos are just incredible.
[02:06:40.895 --> 02:06:44.357]  The Santa Ana winds blasting in a hurricane force.
[02:06:44.357 --> 02:06:46.358]  The police and firefighters completely exhausted.
[02:06:46.358 --> 02:06:47.159]  Pray for those folks.
[02:06:48.331 --> 02:06:53.373]  The whole FBI Democrat fake investigation imploding.
[02:06:53.373 --> 02:06:54.934]  Again, I saw the canary in the coal mines.
[02:06:54.934 --> 02:07:07.660]  Democrats, even on CNN, MSNBC, distancing themselves from Comey and Hillary and all these resignations that are happening.
[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:11.462]  Don't you think Glenn Beck and all the neocons and the Weekly Standard people and
[02:07:12.321 --> 02:07:17.806]  All the rest of them that thought that they could be never Trumpers and stop this revolution to restore the Republic.
[02:07:17.806 --> 02:07:21.009]  Don't you think they feel dumb now?
[02:07:21.009 --> 02:07:25.953]  Decimating their audiences, turning their audiences off, and missing out on being on the right side of history.
[02:07:25.953 --> 02:07:32.399]  I don't want to be too confident right now, but even if they kill Trump, it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:07:32.399 --> 02:07:38.885]  And even if they do this whole phony indictment still, I hope they go ahead with it, quite frankly.
[02:07:41.078 --> 02:07:45.602]  I don't think Roger Stone is right at this point.
[02:07:45.602 --> 02:07:47.783]  I don't think Trump should fire Comey.
[02:07:47.783 --> 02:07:55.549]  Now Stone had the idea first to create another special counsel to investigate Comey and investigate Mueller, excuse me, fire Mueller.
[02:07:55.549 --> 02:08:00.413]  Same thing, same person, basically, same institution.
[02:08:00.413 --> 02:08:07.259]  His idea of having a special counsel is now being picked up, I saw it on Fox News this morning, on two different shows.
[02:08:08.846 --> 02:08:15.211]  So, it's now definitely happening and the recovery of the United States could actually happen.
[02:08:15.211 --> 02:08:17.653]  Doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
[02:08:17.653 --> 02:08:20.195]  Doesn't mean everything's perfect.
[02:08:20.195 --> 02:08:22.297]  But it is a very, very exciting time to be alive.
[02:08:24.622 --> 02:08:29.844]  Now, I want to get to more of the Senator Grassley speech that he gave last night in the Senate.
[02:08:29.844 --> 02:08:31.104]  It was very, very powerful.
[02:08:31.104 --> 02:08:33.425]  We're going to go to Part 2 of that in a moment.
[02:08:33.425 --> 02:08:39.827]  Grassley outlines political bias of FBI officials, and Grassley is impeccably bipartisan.
[02:08:40.467 --> 02:08:43.108]  And he realizes the will of the people turned against this.
[02:08:43.108 --> 02:08:57.096]  Folks really see through the witch hunt now and that's why you see the usual suspects acting super confident going, he will go to prison, he has the nooses around his neck, everyone associated with Trump will be in prison for life, he is insane, he is evil, he is Hitler.
[02:08:57.096 --> 02:09:07.581]  These are all quotes from Obama and Morning Sloppy Joe and Brzezinski's dropping and all of it.
[02:09:07.581 --> 02:09:08.682]  He's a big news creature.
[02:09:10.602 --> 02:09:13.804]  The big news is Brzezinski's leaving, excuse me, that's her name.
[02:09:13.804 --> 02:09:17.206]  So you've got all of this happening.
[02:09:17.206 --> 02:09:21.149]  And it's just an incredible time to be alive because the people are awake.
[02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:23.310]  The people are awake, not just here but all over the world.
[02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:25.151]  They're waking up more.
[02:09:25.151 --> 02:09:27.273]  It's a great time of renewal happening.
[02:09:27.273 --> 02:09:34.578]  There's going to be fits and pains and probably bad stuff happening, but an awake population is 50 times better than one that isn't awake.
[02:09:35.509 --> 02:09:41.973]  Now briefly, before I get to this Grassley clip, we have a new product that I know is going to end up being our number one bestseller.
[02:09:41.973 --> 02:09:48.757]  I know it is because I've taken it in the last month and quite frankly I can't even hardly handle it myself.
[02:09:48.757 --> 02:09:51.819]  It is so incredibly strong.
[02:09:51.819 --> 02:09:52.660]  It's alpha power.
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:57.763]  It increases physical and mental energy, boosts sports performance, helps reduce fatigue,
[02:09:59.207 --> 02:10:03.072]  Alpha power and the ingredients in it are just heads above the best.
[02:10:03.072 --> 02:10:07.717]  We can say this is the most powerful formula in the class that it is out there.
[02:10:07.717 --> 02:10:08.278]  It's amazing.
[02:10:08.278 --> 02:10:10.640]  Stamina, libido, sports performance, brain.
[02:10:11.792 --> 02:10:13.373]  Cholesterol.
[02:10:13.373 --> 02:10:16.956]  You can say it works on that and makes that healthy.
[02:10:16.956 --> 02:10:21.760]  I mean, it's just crazy how amazing alpha power is.
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:28.226]  We also have our colloidal silver fortified and iodine fortified fluoride-free super blue toothpaste for children and adults.
[02:10:28.226 --> 02:10:31.188]  Both types, both bubblegum flavor and peppermint.
[02:10:31.188 --> 02:10:33.490]  50% off, along with the mouthwash, 50% off.
[02:10:34.651 --> 02:10:38.876]  We also have 50% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion with Amino Acids Fruit Punch Drink.
[02:10:38.876 --> 02:10:44.082]  Great for yourself, great for children, great way to absorb more of the multivitamins and minerals in that fruit punch.
[02:10:44.082 --> 02:10:44.983]  Those are the sales.
[02:10:44.983 --> 02:10:46.284]  They're huge.
[02:10:46.284 --> 02:10:46.665]  50% off.
[02:10:46.665 --> 02:10:49.308]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:49.628 --> 02:10:54.669]  China Ferrato is shipping an initial 10% off, and those products at 50% off are lost liters.
[02:10:54.669 --> 02:10:58.630]  And Alfa Power is 50% off out of the gates.
[02:10:58.630 --> 02:11:01.671]  It's a very expensive formula, the amount of product we put in it.
[02:11:01.671 --> 02:11:09.433]  Leading competitors, ladies and gentlemen, sell something similar but watered down for more than we do, and ours is 50 times stronger.
[02:11:09.433 --> 02:11:16.275]  That's the LJ100 alone is off the charts.
[02:11:17.287 --> 02:11:17.788]  I don't think so.
[02:11:37.048 --> 02:11:42.511]  It is interesting that before he was fired, FBI Director Comey lectured our Judiciary Committee and lectured the public about how the men and women of the FBI
[02:12:06.129 --> 02:12:10.132]  Quote, don't give a rip about politics.
[02:12:10.132 --> 02:12:12.294]  End of quote.
[02:12:12.294 --> 02:12:22.121]  I believe that for most of the hard-working rank-and-file FBI agents, that is absolutely true.
[02:12:22.121 --> 02:12:34.410]  Their jobs normally don't involve controversial political questions and their own political views aren't relevant because they are professionals.
[02:12:35.674 --> 02:12:44.298]  But no human is perfect, and no organization is immune from error.
[02:12:44.298 --> 02:13:02.467]  It does no good for the leaders of the FBI to pretend that its senior management is above all reproach, that they would never show any improper political bias, and would never make mistakes.
[02:13:03.971 --> 02:13:17.259]  The only way to protect against bias or misconduct is to recognize it exists and to confront it, not to hide it from Congress and the American people.
[02:13:17.259 --> 02:13:17.780]  The law
[02:13:18.903 --> 02:13:27.007]  And the facts, whoever they are, should guide the work of the FBI and the Justice Department.
[02:13:27.007 --> 02:13:28.247]  You're all going to jail.
[02:13:28.247 --> 02:13:39.453]  If politics infected the department's decisions during a hotly contested national political campaign, we would have to look at it.
[02:13:39.453 --> 02:13:46.836]  That is true whether it occurred in the Clinton case, or in the Trump-Russia case, or if it included both.
[02:13:48.144 --> 02:13:55.893]  Anyone claiming to do bipartisan oversight of the executive branch has to examine both.
[02:13:55.893 --> 02:14:03.961]  Ignoring either half of this story simply won't be credible with the other half.
[02:14:03.961 --> 02:14:05.723]  I love the fact they tried it.
[02:14:05.723 --> 02:14:06.684]  I love the fact they tried it.
[02:14:06.684 --> 02:14:09.828]  Everyone thought Hillary Clinton was going to be president.
[02:14:11.113 --> 02:14:11.993]  Everyone.
[02:14:11.993 --> 02:14:13.014]  Not me.
[02:14:13.014 --> 02:14:24.677]  And the perception of a huge segment of the public is that the whole Washington establishment worked overtime to get her name cleared before the Democrat convention last summer.
[02:14:24.677 --> 02:14:25.877]  That's right.
[02:14:25.877 --> 02:14:32.279]  The FBI even called its case quote-unquote mid-year exam.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:45.382]  Director Comey testified that the former Attorney General refused to even name the FBI's work and investigation.
[02:14:45.382 --> 02:14:47.883]  That's how political it came.
[02:14:47.883 --> 02:14:49.483]  And she went on the tarmac.
[02:14:49.483 --> 02:14:57.945]  The Attorney General at that time, insisting on calling it not an investigation, but quote-unquote, a matter.
[02:14:57.945 --> 02:14:59.446]  M-A-T-T-E-R.
[02:14:59.446 --> 02:15:00.526]  And that's the same operative.
[02:15:02.133 --> 02:15:10.482]  We've learned that Director Comey started drafting his exoneration statement long before the investigation was done.
[02:15:10.482 --> 02:15:14.446]  It looks like there was a rush to clear her.
[02:15:14.446 --> 02:15:16.988]  It looks like the fix was in.
[02:15:22.352 --> 02:15:29.977]  They've got them and more witnesses are coming forward and they've got their communications now that they're under investigation, how they were rigging all this.
[02:15:29.977 --> 02:15:37.022]  They were so arrogant because this trash at the top of the FBI and the Justice Department has been there since the Clintons.
[02:15:37.842 --> 02:15:39.923]  And they just do whatever they want.
[02:15:39.923 --> 02:15:51.590]  Tarmac meetings that are illegal, Russian deals, Chinese deals, Chinese generals in the White House, murdering people, you name it, with that big arrogant pumpkinhead Mueller up there like he's God.
[02:15:51.590 --> 02:15:52.891]  You're not a God filth!
[02:15:54.178 --> 02:15:56.079]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:15:56.079 --> 02:15:59.301]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:15:59.301 --> 02:16:00.903]  Savory and delicious.
[02:16:00.903 --> 02:16:03.744]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:16:03.744 --> 02:16:04.405]  Awesome!
[02:16:04.405 --> 02:16:07.487]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[02:16:07.487 --> 02:16:09.048]  NASA PAC Technology.

[02:20:12.665 --> 02:20:20.348]  We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[02:20:20.348 --> 02:20:23.749]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[02:20:23.749 --> 02:20:25.089]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:31.338 --> 02:20:35.599]  And there's Peter in Texarkana.
[02:20:35.599 --> 02:20:36.679]  Really exciting things.
[02:20:36.679 --> 02:20:44.000]  You got Senator Grassley up there on the floor of the Senate saying the public thinks the fix is in.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.281]  And the public's angry with this whole fake FBI investigation.
[02:20:48.281 --> 02:20:50.722]  And now the Democratic pundits aren't turning against Hillary.
[02:20:50.722 --> 02:20:52.802]  They're not turning against Hollywood.
[02:20:52.802 --> 02:20:54.963]  The whole thing's falling apart.
[02:20:54.963 --> 02:20:56.843]  And they're saying, oh, it looks really bad.
[02:20:57.930 --> 02:20:58.870]  It's political.
[02:20:58.870 --> 02:21:02.431]  They did this to destroy Trump and get rid of the election.
[02:21:02.431 --> 02:21:20.856]  They were so arrogant, they've written articles about how they're gonna get rid of Trump and then suspend the whole election and get rid of any Republicans that were elected, but leave Democrats in, and then have new elections with Homeland Security in charge, and Obama signed orders before he left, federalizing Homeland Security.
[02:21:20.856 --> 02:21:23.877]  I mean, these guys are obvious.
[02:21:23.877 --> 02:21:24.657]  And when you're awake,
[02:21:25.882 --> 02:21:27.503]  They're really obvious.
[02:21:27.503 --> 02:21:29.765]  I got a clip with Jim Jordan.
[02:21:29.765 --> 02:21:32.947]  Pushes FBI on ties between Peter Strzok.
[02:21:32.947 --> 02:21:33.867]  Hard to pronounce his name.
[02:21:33.867 --> 02:21:34.848]  And Trump surveillance.
[02:21:34.848 --> 02:21:37.230]  We know the surveillance is being run by him.
[02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:39.471]  We know he did it with the PP dossier.
[02:21:39.471 --> 02:21:40.232]  That's all fake.
[02:21:40.232 --> 02:21:41.693]  That's how they ran the fraud.
[02:21:41.693 --> 02:21:43.374]  That's how they got the illegal surveillance.
[02:21:43.374 --> 02:21:44.154]  That was the plan.
[02:21:44.154 --> 02:21:48.897]  They thought they'd find something because they were all in bed with the Russians.
[02:21:48.897 --> 02:21:50.559]  That's big money.
[02:21:50.559 --> 02:21:53.460]  I can't believe Trump isn't like you.
[02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:55.342]  He's not a sack of garbage like you.
[02:21:57.267 --> 02:22:02.628]  Let's go back to Senator Chuck Grassley, then we'll go to Jim Jordan.
[02:22:02.628 --> 02:22:05.169]  Here is part of what he was saying.
[02:22:05.169 --> 02:22:13.491]  We've learned that Director Comey started drafting his exoneration statement long before the investigation was done.
[02:22:13.491 --> 02:22:17.452]  It looks like there was a rush to clear her.
[02:22:17.452 --> 02:22:18.572]  It looks like the fix
[02:22:19.914 --> 02:22:24.739]  I know Democrats don't want to hear that.
[02:22:24.739 --> 02:22:27.141]  They only want to talk about Trump.
[02:22:27.141 --> 02:22:42.015]  There is a double standard here in the way that they desperately want to go after the president, but ignore all other potential wrongdoing in the previous administration.
[02:22:42.015 --> 02:22:44.177]  It stinks to high heaven.
[02:22:45.336 --> 02:22:50.879]  But Democrats have visions of impeachment dancing in their heads.
[02:22:50.879 --> 02:23:02.504]  Rather than reserve judgment and carefully examine the facts, all of the facts, they're jumping to all sorts of conclusions.
[02:23:02.504 --> 02:23:10.308]  The Judiciary Committee has an obligation to do both a deep dive into the firing of James Comey and both
[02:23:11.323 --> 02:23:16.786]  Of the two controversial political investigations that preceded it.
[02:23:16.786 --> 02:23:22.770]  Unfortunately, the Democrats are preventing any truly bipartisan path forward.
[02:23:22.770 --> 02:23:27.032]  They appear to be assuming the conclusion at the outset.
[02:23:27.032 --> 02:23:29.093]  They complain publicly.
[02:23:29.093 --> 02:23:31.175]  And they complain privately.
[02:23:31.175 --> 02:23:35.917]  That I'm not doing enough to investigate obstruction.
[02:23:35.917 --> 02:23:40.060]  But obstruction of justice is a legal term of art.
[02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:44.393]  It is a conclusion, not evidence.
[02:23:44.393 --> 02:23:45.054]  That's right.
[02:23:45.054 --> 02:23:48.457]  That is not how I conduct my investigation.
[02:23:48.457 --> 02:23:49.337]  Exactly.
[02:23:49.337 --> 02:23:57.364]  I do not make my conclusions first and try to shoehorn the facts to fit my conclusions.
[02:23:57.364 --> 02:24:01.788]  I try to get the facts and then go where those facts lead.
[02:24:01.788 --> 02:24:03.410]  Pause real quick.
[02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:05.632]  People keep asking why we're so accurate.
[02:24:06.758 --> 02:24:11.619]  And how we know stuff other people don't know, and how we predict things that are like 95% accurate?
[02:24:11.619 --> 02:24:18.240]  Because I don't get up here and predict things because I want to make it true, like Oprah Winfrey and The Secret.
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:21.401]  I don't believe in that.
[02:24:21.401 --> 02:24:28.382]  I go off of history, research, and being immersed in this, to then tell you where I think things are going.
[02:24:28.382 --> 02:24:29.802]  That's why we're so accurate.
[02:24:29.802 --> 02:24:32.423]  It's why our government listens, other governments listen.
[02:24:32.423 --> 02:24:34.423]  I mean, get tomorrow's news today.
[02:24:35.526 --> 02:24:38.909]  Get next year's news today at InfoWars.com.
[02:24:38.909 --> 02:24:42.192]  And that's exactly what Grassley's saying here.
[02:24:42.192 --> 02:24:44.074]  Trump's Mr. Americana.
[02:24:44.074 --> 02:24:45.816]  He never built Jack in Russia.
[02:24:45.816 --> 02:24:46.757]  There's nothing there.
[02:24:46.757 --> 02:24:48.839]  Let's continue.
[02:24:49.844 --> 02:24:57.427]  ...examples of where investigations have uncovered facts that point to, quote-unquote, obstruction.
[02:24:57.427 --> 02:25:01.349]  Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon both lied to investigators.
[02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:03.069]  That is obstruction.
[02:25:03.069 --> 02:25:07.031]  And that behavior got one of them impeached and forced the other to resign.
[02:25:08.072 --> 02:25:20.918]  We also recently learned that Hillary Clinton's lawyers used a program called Bleach Bit to delete 33,000 emails under subpoena by the House of Representatives.
[02:25:20.918 --> 02:25:22.578]  That's open and shut, obstruction!
[02:25:22.578 --> 02:25:28.181]  Now those government records, and they are government records, can never be recovered.
[02:25:29.284 --> 02:25:33.326]  Those facts certainly look like obstruction.
[02:25:33.326 --> 02:25:36.047]  But we don't have all the facts here yet.
[02:25:36.047 --> 02:25:45.051]  So far, I've seen no credible evidence that President Trump has told anyone to lie.
[02:25:45.051 --> 02:25:52.955]  I also have seen no credible evidence that he or his aides have destroyed records being sought by investigators.
[02:25:54.139 --> 02:26:03.722]  Many people firmly believe that the president fired the FBI director in order to improperly hold an investigation of Lieutenant General Flynn.
[02:26:03.722 --> 02:26:15.165]  Now, I'm not only willing, but I'm eager to delve deeply into all the circumstances surrounding Director Comey's removal.
[02:26:15.165 --> 02:26:23.668]  But to claim at the outset that his removal was obstruction of justice puts the cart before the horse.
[02:26:24.659 --> 02:26:28.083]  And then you can't ever have a real investigation because you just botched it.
[02:26:28.083 --> 02:26:29.105]  It's a mistrial.
[02:26:29.105 --> 02:26:31.247]  And then you've got the transcripts of doing U.S.
[02:26:31.247 --> 02:26:35.293]  interest on the phone, so there's no crime to have obstruction to begin with.
[02:26:35.293 --> 02:26:38.757]  It's baloney!
[02:26:38.757 --> 02:26:39.578]  Beyond baloney.
[02:26:39.578 --> 02:26:40.819]  I wanted to say Bravo Sierra.
[02:26:44.568 --> 02:26:50.852]  Here's Jim Jordan, congressman, pushes FBI on ties between Peter Strzok and the Trump surveillance.
[02:26:50.852 --> 02:26:52.633]  And they already know all this.
[02:26:52.633 --> 02:26:58.237]  They just are letting them put the noose around their neck and act like they don't know.
[02:26:58.237 --> 02:26:59.258]  This is really shameful.
[02:26:59.258 --> 02:27:05.842]  The FBI needs to come clean on Democratic operatives that penetrated them, or the FBI is going to be finished.
[02:27:05.842 --> 02:27:07.183]  You're going to have to change your name.
[02:27:07.183 --> 02:27:08.464]  And I'm not just saying that.
[02:27:08.464 --> 02:27:13.928]  You've got to come clean now and get rid of these people, or it's just you're going to be politically mud.
[02:27:15.008 --> 02:27:17.291]  Like, you know, your name is Mudd.
[02:27:17.291 --> 02:27:19.813]  Like Mudd's great-great-grandpa helping kill Kennedy.
[02:27:19.813 --> 02:27:21.695]  I mean, helping kill Lincoln.
[02:27:21.695 --> 02:27:24.298]  Your name's Mudd, and still today you want to kill the President.
[02:27:24.298 --> 02:27:27.061]  Here, let's go, or says he's going to be killed.
[02:27:27.061 --> 02:27:27.981]  He's running around free.
[02:27:27.981 --> 02:27:28.962]  We're going to kill him!
[02:27:28.962 --> 02:27:29.623]  We're going to kill him!
[02:27:29.623 --> 02:27:31.845]  I'm a former head of counterterrorism that did stuff like that.
[02:27:31.845 --> 02:27:32.606]  I'm going to kill him.
[02:27:32.606 --> 02:27:34.508]  We're going to kill him soon.
[02:27:34.508 --> 02:27:36.009]  Here comes the Secret Service, bro.
[02:27:36.009 --> 02:27:37.231]  So, let's go to the Congressman.
[02:27:38.387 --> 02:27:41.569]  I mean, there are all kinds of people on Mueller's team who are pro-Clinton.
[02:27:41.569 --> 02:27:43.070]  There's been all kinds of stories.
[02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:49.434]  PolitiFact reported 96% of the top lawyers' contributions went to Clinton or Obama.
[02:27:49.434 --> 02:28:08.107]  But Peter Strzok, the guy who ran the Clinton investigation, interviewed Mills, Abedin, interviewed Secretary Clinton, changed gross negligence and crime to the term extreme carelessness, who ran the Russian investigation, who interviewed Mike Flynn, gets put on Mueller's team, and then he gets kicked off for a text message that's anti-Trump.
[02:28:11.008 --> 02:28:15.090]  If he kicked everybody off Mueller's team who was anti-Trump, I don't think there'd be anybody left.
[02:28:15.090 --> 02:28:15.770]  Bingo!
[02:28:15.770 --> 02:28:18.311]  So here, there's got to be something more here.
[02:28:18.311 --> 02:28:19.031]  It's for optics.
[02:28:19.031 --> 02:28:23.653]  It can't just be some text messages that show a pro-Clinton, anti-Trump bias.
[02:28:23.653 --> 02:28:24.534]  No, he made up the PPG.
[02:28:24.534 --> 02:28:26.314]  There's got to be something more.
[02:28:26.314 --> 02:28:27.615]  And I'm trying to figure out what it is.
[02:28:27.615 --> 02:28:28.195]  PPG.
[02:28:28.195 --> 02:28:31.597]  But my hunch is, it has something to do with the dossier.
[02:28:31.597 --> 02:28:31.897]  PPG.
[02:28:32.947 --> 02:28:33.888]  Director did.
[02:28:33.888 --> 02:28:35.009]  Peter struck.
[02:28:35.009 --> 02:28:35.329]  Hit pause.
[02:28:35.329 --> 02:28:35.910]  We're going to come back.
[02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:37.431]  This is too powerful.
[02:28:37.431 --> 02:28:38.732]  And literally, that's what's happening.
[02:28:38.732 --> 02:28:39.693]  It's like a Geiger counter.

[02:31:13.329 --> 02:31:20.914]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:31:21.454 --> 02:31:26.356]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[02:31:26.356 --> 02:31:29.318]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.

[02:33:11.992 --> 02:33:18.096]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.096 --> 02:33:23.860]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:27.262]  Something you call love, but confess.
[02:33:27.262 --> 02:33:29.564]  You've been a messin'.
[02:33:29.564 --> 02:33:31.145]  You've been a messin'.
[02:33:31.145 --> 02:33:33.266]  Well, you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[02:33:33.266 --> 02:33:35.648]  With America's prosperity and America's freedom.
[02:33:38.115 --> 02:33:39.515]  I gotta tell you, Trump is delivering.
[02:33:39.515 --> 02:33:44.816]  Even CNN has the big articles saying he's following all his promises or trying to get the others done.
[02:33:44.816 --> 02:33:46.177]  And they say that's a bad thing.
[02:33:46.177 --> 02:33:47.437]  You're not supposed to keep promises.
[02:33:47.437 --> 02:33:53.178]  Meanwhile, Obama compares him to Hitler and says he'll commit genocide, clearly trying to get an assassination going.
[02:33:53.178 --> 02:33:57.819]  The Secret Service is investigating Democratic operatives and others for their statements.
[02:33:57.819 --> 02:34:01.420]  They've told me they are investigating under the direction of the President.
[02:34:02.423 --> 02:34:02.803]  From D.C.
[02:34:02.803 --> 02:34:28.105]  The Secret Service and I talked to were pretty amazed, but the point is, we're pointing all this out, and I'm surprised other people haven't co-edited it all together or made a big deal, but mainstream media made mistakes with my quotes all over the news last week, because the Secret Service took notice and went and said, yeah, we didn't even know about some of those clips on the news, because it's big official people in public saying it, like Mudd and others, and Brennan and Clapper, so folks are
[02:34:28.826 --> 02:34:32.441]  Folks are really arrogant out there pushing this whole narrative.
[02:34:33.584 --> 02:34:40.969]  Now, Max Keiser is a hard man to get on, but he just landed in New York from wherever he's been globetrotting.
[02:34:40.969 --> 02:34:45.632]  He's one of the first people to promote cryptocurrencies and to promote Bitcoin.
[02:34:45.632 --> 02:34:51.216]  And I wish to heaven, what was it, five, six years ago when he told me, you got to get on a Bitcoin, that I'd listen to this man.
[02:34:51.216 --> 02:34:54.018]  I've never gotten into it because I'm busy in news and information.
[02:34:54.018 --> 02:34:56.039]  I own no stocks.
[02:34:56.039 --> 02:34:57.100]  I just, that's not what I do.
[02:34:57.100 --> 02:35:00.602]  I'm just here with news and info because if I got into stocks and stuff, I'd get obsessed with it.
[02:35:00.602 --> 02:35:02.723]  Whatever I work on, I get obsessed with.
[02:35:02.723 --> 02:35:03.444]  I've got everything about it.
[02:35:03.965 --> 02:35:05.066]  You know, I start watching sports.
[02:35:05.066 --> 02:35:05.687]  That's all I do.
[02:35:05.687 --> 02:35:07.850]  I mean, that's why I can't watch sports.
[02:35:07.850 --> 02:35:09.392]  It's just news, news, news, and my family.
[02:35:09.392 --> 02:35:10.573]  That's it.
[02:35:10.573 --> 02:35:14.378]  But man, cryptocurrency market now worth more than JP Morgan.
[02:35:14.378 --> 02:35:16.481]  $370 billion and growing exponentially.
[02:35:20.570 --> 02:35:28.073]  And I know it's real because it's at least something citizens have versus what the globalists have, which is their own fiat money, but then they just get to use it.
[02:35:28.073 --> 02:35:29.693]  So central banks move on over.
[02:35:29.693 --> 02:35:33.255]  I thought they'd shut it down, but I guess they just couldn't stop it.
[02:35:33.255 --> 02:35:38.477]  But Bitcoin has gained $4,000 in just two days.
[02:35:38.477 --> 02:35:39.877]  $16,000 per Bitcoin.
[02:35:39.877 --> 02:35:47.960]  If I'd have bought Bitcoin back when I first learned about it, when nobody knew about it, it was just first hearing about Max Keiser, I mean, I could have invested $100,000 and I'd have
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:51.941]  I'd have 50 million dollars.
[02:35:51.941 --> 02:35:54.102]  I mean, break this down for us.
[02:35:54.102 --> 02:35:55.323]  This is just astonishing.
[02:35:55.323 --> 02:35:58.845]  CNBC, it's now the biggest thing in the world.
[02:35:58.845 --> 02:36:02.807]  Just cryptocurrencies alone is bigger than JP Morgan.
[02:36:02.807 --> 02:36:06.389]  What in the world is going on, Max Keiser?
[02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:08.130]  How's it going?
[02:36:08.130 --> 02:36:08.730]  Good, my friend.
[02:36:08.730 --> 02:36:13.033]  I mean, I know you're in the airport, but wow, you told... I first heard about Bitcoin from you.
[02:36:13.033 --> 02:36:13.833]  Give me the history.
[02:36:13.833 --> 02:36:14.694]  How many years ago was that?
[02:36:15.888 --> 02:36:22.555]  Yeah, it was $3 a coin back then, and we suggested that this could do the work that our Crash J.P.
[02:36:22.555 --> 02:36:26.980]  Morgan Buy Silver campaign was trying to do, and that is to decapitalize the big banks.
[02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:27.500]  Oh, I forgot!
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:30.123]  Word for word, you said it was to get bigger than them!
[02:36:30.123 --> 02:36:31.685]  You are like a prophet!
[02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:40.061]  Yeah, pretty much, because we needed a way to introduce money that they couldn't control and they couldn't manipulate.
[02:36:40.061 --> 02:36:41.222]  And Bitcoin is that money.
[02:36:41.222 --> 02:36:44.884]  Now they're all scrambling to get involved and the price is going to go a lot higher.
[02:36:44.884 --> 02:36:46.766]  And this is the currency of the revolution.
[02:36:46.766 --> 02:36:50.268]  This is the currency of the global insurrection against banker occupation.
[02:36:50.268 --> 02:36:51.549]  Bitcoin is the real thing, Alex.
[02:36:52.529 --> 02:36:53.950]  I know it's real.
[02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:57.812]  I just, if I couldn't 100% guarantee it was safe, I couldn't, I agreed.
[02:36:57.812 --> 02:36:59.272]  Get it, listeners, if you think.
[02:36:59.272 --> 02:37:00.033]  I had you on.
[02:37:00.033 --> 02:37:02.494]  I've been a promoter of it, just saying, look out.
[02:37:02.494 --> 02:37:05.335]  Because, you know, I thought they'd shoot down the lead elephant.
[02:37:05.335 --> 02:37:06.116]  They haven't.
[02:37:06.116 --> 02:37:08.117]  It looks like they're going to capitulate to it.
[02:37:08.117 --> 02:37:10.278]  And like you said, it may become the new global currency.
[02:37:11.656 --> 02:37:13.497]  Well, they will capitulate to it.
[02:37:13.497 --> 02:37:17.218]  As far as it being a global currency, that's a loaded term.
[02:37:17.218 --> 02:37:19.979]  I don't mean politically with globalists running it.
[02:37:19.979 --> 02:37:24.320]  I mean the people's global currency will be cryptocurrencies in general.
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:30.342]  The people's currency is definitely going to be cryptocurrency, and the fiat money world is collapsing.
[02:37:30.342 --> 02:37:36.104]  There's about $300 trillion worth of debt in the world, and all of that debt is going to collapse.
[02:37:36.104 --> 02:37:37.084]  It's already collapsing.
[02:37:37.084 --> 02:37:38.205]  Fiat money is collapsing.
[02:37:38.205 --> 02:37:39.285]  What's beautiful about
[02:37:39.745 --> 02:37:43.407]  Bitcoin right now is, there's a couple of concepts I want to tell you about.
[02:37:43.407 --> 02:37:48.028]  One is called hyper-Bitcoinization, and the other is called the Bitcoin black hole.
[02:37:48.028 --> 02:37:57.512]  So the Bitcoin black hole is when Bitcoin sucks in all the other fiat money from all the other exchanges and different fiat money and different currencies.
[02:37:57.512 --> 02:37:58.613]  We see that happening right now.
[02:37:59.173 --> 02:38:03.259]  And then hyper-Bitcoinization is when Bitcoin becomes a unit of account.
[02:38:03.259 --> 02:38:08.507]  So everything at your store is priced in Bitcoin, people are paid in Bitcoin, people's savings are in Bitcoin.
[02:38:08.507 --> 02:38:11.651]  It becomes the de facto currency, the go-to currency.
[02:38:11.651 --> 02:38:12.593]  That's what people want.
[02:38:12.593 --> 02:38:15.437]  There's an old law in economics called Fair's Law.
[02:38:16.335 --> 02:38:18.738]  And it's talking about good money pushing out bad.
[02:38:18.738 --> 02:38:21.441]  And we're seeing that happen on an epic global scale right now.
[02:38:21.441 --> 02:38:24.424]  Good money is pushing out the bad fiat money.
[02:38:24.424 --> 02:38:29.769]  And anyone who owns it, everything that they buy constantly goes down in price because it's highly deflationary.
[02:38:29.769 --> 02:38:36.877]  The amount of supply goes down by 50% every four years, whereas in the fiat money world, the supply increases dramatically every month.
[02:38:38.018 --> 02:38:49.229]  And what you say is key, because all the old global currencies have got bad mortgages and scams and derivatives infecting them and are all connected to bad assets.
[02:38:49.229 --> 02:38:55.155]  When Bitcoin is just people's confidence and it's basic technology, it is the next level.
[02:38:55.155 --> 02:39:00.119]  So it's better than the old fiat currency, because that's what I kind of saw it as, is a new fiat.
[02:39:01.221 --> 02:39:03.441]  And it's being proven so, but not just Bitcoin.
[02:39:03.441 --> 02:39:08.182]  I know that you've created some other cryptocurrencies, not just been one of the main launchers of Bitcoin.
[02:39:08.182 --> 02:39:15.644]  So let's expand on that, where you think it's going, and then who will be dominant in the new cryptocurrency system, and can the empire strike back?
[02:39:15.644 --> 02:39:16.824]  Can they try to shut it down?
[02:39:16.824 --> 02:39:18.384]  I think it's too late.
[02:39:18.384 --> 02:39:26.986]  Well, the idea of Bitcoin being something that is outside of regulation, and people are trying to regulate it, and it's not regulated, is false.
[02:39:27.958 --> 02:39:30.282]  Bitcoin is regulated by the Bitcoin protocol.
[02:39:30.282 --> 02:39:31.825]  It's regulated by software.
[02:39:31.825 --> 02:39:32.947]  That's what I meant.
[02:39:32.947 --> 02:39:35.252]  That's its value is that it's self-regulating.
[02:39:36.121 --> 02:39:37.902]  It is.
[02:39:37.902 --> 02:39:41.544]  There's a core development team that is maintaining the Bitcoin network.
[02:39:41.544 --> 02:39:46.706]  Then you have the miners, then you have the merchants, then you have the people who are buying and holding, or hodling as it's called.
[02:39:46.706 --> 02:39:51.089]  And all these things work together in a very beautiful symmetry to create a parallel economy.
[02:39:51.089 --> 02:39:55.911]  Okay, six months ago I was sold on it finally, you know, late to the game.
[02:39:55.911 --> 02:39:56.731]  I asked you to come to Austin.
[02:39:56.731 --> 02:40:00.993]  You said, oh yes, I'll be there in three weeks to help me, help me invest, help the audience.
[02:40:00.993 --> 02:40:02.434]  And then you're just too powerful.
[02:40:02.434 --> 02:40:03.595]  You won't come.
[02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:07.421]  Well, it's just, I mean, the best thing you can do is just buy Bitcoin and wait.
[02:40:07.421 --> 02:40:08.361]  Just buy it and hold it.
[02:40:08.361 --> 02:40:10.642]  I know, but I don't know who to get it from or what to do.
[02:40:10.642 --> 02:40:16.744]  And then some Bitcoin and others just got raided, not raided, they just had hackers steal 65 million.
[02:40:16.744 --> 02:40:21.846]  I mean, I want to know, if I'm going to get into it, Kaiser, I need to talk to one of the Bitcoin wizards.
[02:40:21.846 --> 02:40:25.267]  Look, there's a couple of misinformation out there.
[02:40:25.267 --> 02:40:30.869]  Let me tell you, if you want to buy Bitcoin right now, people, they're going to... I'm asking you, where do I buy the Bitcoin?
[02:40:31.847 --> 02:40:33.287]  At Coinbase.com.
[02:40:33.287 --> 02:40:33.907]  Okay.
[02:40:33.907 --> 02:40:35.108]  I believe you.
[02:40:35.108 --> 02:40:42.889]  Okay, now as far as the problems that you're talking about, the exchanges where people trade Bitcoin, they are occasionally hacked.
[02:40:42.889 --> 02:40:44.929]  And they occasionally have problems.
[02:40:44.929 --> 02:40:50.090]  But that has nothing to do with the Bitcoin protocol itself, the core value of Bitcoin.
[02:40:50.090 --> 02:40:50.710]  I got it.
[02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:53.971]  It's not the currency itself, it's the money that people have made off of it.
[02:40:53.971 --> 02:40:55.971]  Get to Wall Street.
[02:40:55.971 --> 02:40:57.652]  Okay.
[02:40:57.652 --> 02:40:58.712]  Yeah, I'm actually...
[02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:01.621]  I'm heading to Wall Street right now.
[02:41:01.621 --> 02:41:03.101]  I'm on Wall Street.
[02:41:03.101 --> 02:41:06.003]  The police have cordoned off a big block here.
[02:41:06.003 --> 02:41:07.443]  I'm giving you breaking news, Alex.
[02:41:07.443 --> 02:41:08.143]  I'm on Wall Street.
[02:41:08.143 --> 02:41:09.584]  There's a police action going on.
[02:41:09.584 --> 02:41:10.625]  Some kind of demonstration.
[02:41:10.625 --> 02:41:14.966]  I don't know what the heck's going on, but I'm trying to make my way across the street here.
[02:41:14.966 --> 02:41:17.067]  But anyway, continue please.
[02:41:17.067 --> 02:41:17.988]  No, you're the wizard.
[02:41:17.988 --> 02:41:21.009]  You're the guy that was dead on like a prophet like you had a time machine.
[02:41:21.009 --> 02:41:21.969]  How many years ago was that?
[02:41:21.969 --> 02:41:23.150]  Like five, four, five years ago?
[02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:23.210]  In 2011.
[02:41:26.377 --> 02:41:29.959]  Well, if you put even two or three hundred dollars back at Bitcoin at that time, it would be worth almost two million dollars today.
[02:41:42.728 --> 02:41:51.853]  You told me, you said, and you told me in London again four years ago, you said, Alex, Alex, at dinner, we hung out for days, I'm like, shut up about Bitcoin, Max!
[02:41:51.853 --> 02:41:53.994]  I wish you'd have punched me in the nose!
[02:41:53.994 --> 02:42:01.999]  Listen to this, you know, I was living in London, I gave Russell Brand a thousand Bitcoin as a gift when it was still in the two or three dollar range.
[02:42:01.999 --> 02:42:06.161]  I don't know what he did with it, I think he lost it, but it's now worth 18 million dollars.
[02:42:06.161 --> 02:42:07.402]  Jesus!
[02:42:07.402 --> 02:42:09.183]  You gave him 18 million?
[02:42:09.183 --> 02:42:10.364]  I wish you'd have given that to me!
[02:42:11.562 --> 02:42:15.584]  I gave away so many bitcoins during those days when I was trading for a buck, I'd say, here.
[02:42:15.584 --> 02:42:17.545]  I remember you even tried to give me some.
[02:42:17.545 --> 02:42:21.147]  You said, here, here, let's get on your computer.
[02:42:21.147 --> 02:42:23.968]  I gave George Galloway a free coin.
[02:42:23.968 --> 02:42:25.188]  I tried to give you a free coin.
[02:42:25.188 --> 02:42:28.530]  I've given away probably 2,000 or 3,000 coins during the early years.
[02:42:30.908 --> 02:42:36.653]  I feel, this is one of the few things I regret in my life, because I don't worship money, but missing it and not being able to fund the operation.
[02:42:36.653 --> 02:42:37.033]  Stay there.
[02:42:37.033 --> 02:42:38.014]  I know you're walking around on Wall Street.
[02:42:38.014 --> 02:42:39.235]  We're going to come back in a few more minutes.
[02:42:39.235 --> 02:42:40.536]  I know you've got to go to a meeting.
[02:42:40.536 --> 02:42:45.540]  But Max, please come to town so you get your proper coronation as the first guy to launch Bitcoin.
[02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:46.341]  Because I follow the news.
[02:42:46.341 --> 02:42:47.722]  You're the first guy I ever heard about it from.
[02:42:47.722 --> 02:42:49.964]  And I know you've done quite well with it yourself.
[02:42:49.964 --> 02:42:52.646]  I don't know how much you've got, but wow.
[02:42:54.039 --> 02:43:09.430]  Hey, if you want to slow down your aging process and protect your heart and brain from constant exposure to harmful toxins, then you need DNA Force, the most complete, full-spectrum, age-defying, cell-protecting formula in the world.
[02:43:09.430 --> 02:43:11.852]  DNA Force is designed to help inner
[02:43:11.852 --> 02:43:12.972]  Yeah, you like the sound of that?
[02:43:12.972 --> 02:43:16.913]  Go to Infowarslife.com right now and check out the reviews for yourself.
[02:43:16.913 --> 02:43:18.113]  And now, just in time for Christmas,
[02:43:37.858 --> 02:43:38.218]  Yeah!
[02:43:38.218 --> 02:43:39.059]  I'm so excited.
[02:43:39.059 --> 02:43:41.721]  The new product at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:41.721 --> 02:43:45.383]  In a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to the brim.
[02:43:45.383 --> 02:43:46.864]  Filled to the absolute top.
[02:43:46.864 --> 02:43:48.065]  The real red pill.
[02:43:48.065 --> 02:43:49.686]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[02:44:08.238 --> 02:44:13.782]  A nootropic doesn't have any stimulus in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:13.782 --> 02:44:22.567]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:24.668 --> 02:44:34.914]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:44:34.914 --> 02:44:44.260]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:46.962]  It is amazing!
[02:44:46.962 --> 02:44:51.925]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:44:55.066 --> 02:44:56.948]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:44:56.948 --> 02:44:58.269]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:44:58.269 --> 02:44:59.470]  Why is this so good?
[02:44:59.470 --> 02:45:04.754]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:45:04.754 --> 02:45:18.305]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:45:18.305 --> 02:45:19.667]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:45:20.427 --> 02:45:22.088]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:45:22.088 --> 02:45:24.610]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:45:24.610 --> 02:45:25.971]  These are all parasites.
[02:45:25.971 --> 02:45:27.051]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:45:27.051 --> 02:45:28.412]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:45:28.412 --> 02:45:32.915]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:45:32.915 --> 02:45:36.037]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:45:36.237 --> 02:45:39.241]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:45:39.241 --> 02:45:40.282]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:45:40.282 --> 02:45:41.123]  Living Defense.
[02:45:41.123 --> 02:45:42.225]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:42.225 --> 02:45:43.246]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:45:43.246 --> 02:45:45.950]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:47.872]  And you support the broadcast.
[02:45:47.872 --> 02:45:49.214]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:49.214 --> 02:45:51.477]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:45:51.477 --> 02:45:53.420]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:45:54.733 --> 02:46:06.807]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[02:46:06.807 --> 02:46:08.169]  So what do we do about it?
[02:46:08.169 --> 02:46:11.293]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[02:46:11.493 --> 02:46:19.201]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[02:46:19.201 --> 02:46:25.427]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.

[02:46:56.693 --> 02:46:59.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.390 --> 02:47:10.991]  All right, folks.
[02:47:10.991 --> 02:47:13.653]  Max Keiser is walking around on Wall Street about to go to an important meeting.
[02:47:13.653 --> 02:47:16.496]  Just landed an hour and a half ago there in New York.
[02:47:16.496 --> 02:47:18.037]  I'm trying to get him on via Skype the next few days.
[02:47:18.037 --> 02:47:21.900]  We're going to fly down here to Austin because, look, I know about financial markets.
[02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:22.461]  I study things.
[02:47:22.461 --> 02:47:25.103]  But if I invest in them, then I get obsessed with it.
[02:47:25.103 --> 02:47:26.304]  I did this about 15 years ago.
[02:47:26.304 --> 02:47:26.865]  I did some investing.
[02:47:26.865 --> 02:47:27.966]  I did pretty good at it.
[02:47:27.966 --> 02:47:29.327]  But then I want to know everything about it.
[02:47:29.327 --> 02:47:30.428]  And it just takes over my time.
[02:47:30.428 --> 02:47:31.429]  I want to be focused on news.
[02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:34.702]  But Bitcoin, he said, it's gonna be revolutionary.
[02:47:34.702 --> 02:47:36.203]  It'll be bigger than JP Morgan.
[02:47:36.203 --> 02:47:37.564]  It's gonna take over.
[02:47:37.564 --> 02:47:39.045]  And it just all came true.
[02:47:39.045 --> 02:47:41.246]  And I remember him trying to give me Bitcoin.
[02:47:41.246 --> 02:47:45.469]  I remember him giving Russell Brand Bitcoin, even though it had already gone up.
[02:47:45.469 --> 02:47:48.691]  So I just sit back and think about how revolutionary this is against the globalists.
[02:47:48.691 --> 02:47:50.032]  They may still pull something.
[02:47:50.032 --> 02:47:51.333]  There's a bunch of other ones.
[02:47:51.333 --> 02:47:52.574]  We have guests on about other ones.
[02:47:52.574 --> 02:47:54.916]  They go up 24% in one day.
[02:47:54.916 --> 02:47:57.478]  The one that McAfee was pushing here.
[02:47:58.098 --> 02:48:04.965]  And so I see everybody, even on my own show, promoting it and exploding, and I'm like, wow, this could really help finance the operation against the globalists.
[02:48:04.965 --> 02:48:08.608]  And I know Eric Prince is invested in it, a lot of other bigwigs think it's the future.
[02:48:08.608 --> 02:48:10.690]  But not just Bitcoin, it was the first.
[02:48:10.690 --> 02:48:12.732]  Tell us, Max Keiser, what else is coming?
[02:48:12.732 --> 02:48:15.635]  What other good ones are?
[02:48:15.635 --> 02:48:16.375]  What do you expect?
[02:48:16.375 --> 02:48:18.738]  We've seen crashes, but it only gets bigger after.
[02:48:18.738 --> 02:48:21.961]  I mean, why does it seem invincible in the six years since its birth?
[02:48:27.233 --> 02:48:29.194]  We just lost him on a cell phone.
[02:48:29.194 --> 02:48:31.856]  Max Keiser drives me crazy.
[02:48:31.856 --> 02:48:42.181]  He calls up once we go to like Brazil whether to make a film or go to London and then I want to give him about politics and he goes, I want to talk about Bitcoin, I want to talk about crashing JPMorgan.
[02:48:42.181 --> 02:48:44.842]  And so he said he'd be on with us and now he's gone.
[02:48:44.842 --> 02:48:46.103]  We call him back.
[02:48:46.103 --> 02:48:48.845]  I love that when I'm like, let's go to the congresswoman now.
[02:48:50.333 --> 02:48:53.296]  It's like the Millennium Falcon.
[02:48:53.296 --> 02:48:53.857]  Watch this!
[02:48:53.857 --> 02:48:57.701]  We're going to hyperspace!
[02:48:57.701 --> 02:48:59.423]  Nothing happens.
[02:48:59.423 --> 02:49:04.449]  Anyways, I just don't want to be part of a tulip hysteria.
[02:49:04.449 --> 02:49:05.890]  What was that?
[02:49:05.890 --> 02:49:08.974]  500 years ago?
[02:49:08.974 --> 02:49:10.275]  Did he think I wasn't going back to him?
[02:49:10.275 --> 02:49:11.697]  You gotta let him know we're going back to him.
[02:49:13.151 --> 02:49:22.375]  They had that thing going on in Europe, but it started like in the Netherlands, and they were exchanging tulips as money, and then it went up in like a month, millions of times, and then it all plunged.
[02:49:22.375 --> 02:49:25.856]  So that's why I made the decision five, six years ago.
[02:49:25.856 --> 02:49:28.157]  Hell, it was more than five years ago.
[02:49:28.157 --> 02:49:31.658]  He was promoting, use it like silver to crash JP Morgan five years ago.
[02:49:31.658 --> 02:49:33.339]  It was longer than that.
[02:49:33.339 --> 02:49:36.620]  It was five years ago he predicted it would become bigger than JP Morgan.
[02:49:39.966 --> 02:49:46.549]  And then, it was a year or so before that, I guess the whole thing got launched, and he's been intimately involved with the folks that have been involved in it from the very, very beginning.
[02:49:46.549 --> 02:49:48.370]  This is very intriguing.
[02:49:48.370 --> 02:49:50.752]  So I'm now extremely intrigued by this.
[02:49:50.752 --> 02:49:58.516]  You know, he did get surrounded by police and was in the middle of some type of demonstration, so maybe something happened to him, because he knew he was still on, right?
[02:49:58.516 --> 02:50:01.017]  Okay, well then his cell phone died or something.
[02:50:01.017 --> 02:50:05.519]  Well, let's just stay on him, and I want him on tomorrow.
[02:50:05.519 --> 02:50:06.900]  Wow, that was amazing.
[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:08.821]  You know, the biggest thing we can invest in is freedom.
[02:50:10.069 --> 02:50:24.940]  And the biggest thing we can invest in is getting politically involved, and being informed, and having a passion, purpose-driven life, and Americana, and Liberta, and Libertarianism, and the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment is what creates incredible freedom.
[02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:36.668]  The problem is you gotta challenge your children, you gotta challenge yourself, you gotta challenge your husband, you gotta challenge your wife, because once we produce all this success and wealth, we tend to get decadent, and then corruption sets in.
[02:50:36.668 --> 02:50:38.209]  And so, that's the paradox.
[02:50:43.078 --> 02:50:46.520]  Since I mentioned it, imagine how much money.
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:47.921]  He got it on the ground floor.
[02:50:47.921 --> 02:50:52.824]  He was giving away thousands of bitcoins all the time.
[02:50:52.824 --> 02:50:55.305]  Tried to give me some, and he was like, give me the laptop.
[02:50:55.305 --> 02:51:01.789]  I remember in London, we're at dinner, and he's like, laptop, your laptop's not, and he's like, man, I'm trying, Alex.
[02:51:01.789 --> 02:51:07.272]  He's trying to give me the, I remember that now, just like he gave Russell Brand $18 million worth.
[02:51:08.680 --> 02:51:10.901]  And the word is Russell Brand doesn't even know what he did with it.
[02:51:10.901 --> 02:51:11.802]  I'm kind of the same way.
[02:51:11.802 --> 02:51:14.243]  I mean, I can be technical.
[02:51:14.243 --> 02:51:17.085]  If I need to be, I'll learn how something works, but there's so much stuff.
[02:51:17.085 --> 02:51:18.546]  I just, I'm not technical.
[02:51:18.546 --> 02:51:19.367]  I can be technical.
[02:51:19.367 --> 02:51:20.287]  I'm not technical.
[02:51:20.287 --> 02:51:25.050]  So it's kind of like what, you know, fairy dust over here, but that's how all the money is.
[02:51:25.050 --> 02:51:26.471]  It's all fiat.
[02:51:26.471 --> 02:51:31.994]  By the way, I want to keep cash and gold around and silver around just like land or just like patents or ideas.
[02:51:31.994 --> 02:51:32.535]  It has value.
[02:51:33.922 --> 02:51:43.706]  And again, the real problem with the Bitcoin, from my research, is that it's people holding them online at the exchanges that get hacked and they get stolen.
[02:51:43.706 --> 02:51:47.567]  You've got to have them hardwired outside the web.
[02:51:47.567 --> 02:51:51.329]  You've got to have it... What's the term they use in intelligence?
[02:51:51.329 --> 02:51:53.689]  Shuttered or cut off?
[02:51:53.689 --> 02:51:54.950]  You've got to have it on a hard drive.
[02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:57.571]  You've got to have it on a memory stick.
[02:51:57.571 --> 02:52:00.292]  Cold storage that is not plugged into anything.
[02:52:01.687 --> 02:52:19.470]  And hackers can even get into like hard drives that have these capacitors in them so the government can energize them with waves and then turn on a capacitor that has enough power to then blurp transmit it onto the phone lines or digital lines or even power lines can be used to oscillate power chips
[02:52:20.211 --> 02:52:22.372]  See, I say I'm not technical, but then I know all the spying stuff.
[02:52:22.372 --> 02:52:23.632]  I just read the spying stuff.
[02:52:23.632 --> 02:52:26.093]  I don't really get all the technicals, but I just know how it works.
[02:52:26.093 --> 02:52:38.096]  They have chips in all the major products that they can remotely, even if you're in cold storage or not plugged into the internet, they can then power up the chips that have transmission capacitors that then
[02:52:38.996 --> 02:52:40.277]  Yes, they're transceivers.
[02:52:40.277 --> 02:52:42.018]  They receive and transmit.
[02:52:42.018 --> 02:52:46.582]  Built into your computer, just like black boxes in your car that can tax you by the mile that all cars have now.
[02:52:46.582 --> 02:52:48.804]  And then suddenly, oh, all cars are self-driving.
[02:52:48.804 --> 02:52:50.845]  They all have the computer program in your car.
[02:52:50.845 --> 02:52:52.046]  You're paying for that.
[02:52:52.046 --> 02:52:57.791]  But then only the luxury cars first come out with it.
[02:52:57.791 --> 02:53:07.979]  Then all the idiots with, you know, Audis and Mercedes or whatever next year pay extra for the self-driving software when really it's already on board all the new cars coming out for years.
[02:53:10.114 --> 02:53:11.355]  So I say I'm not technical.
[02:53:11.355 --> 02:53:27.921]  I'm super technical in the generality of what they're doing and how their grid all works and how it all interconnects, but not from an engineer perspective, just reading the white papers on how the whole internet of things and the whole panopticonic system works.
[02:53:27.921 --> 02:53:30.602]  So I am gonna, I keep, I get busy.
[02:53:30.602 --> 02:53:35.344]  And again, I'm not, I get busy and I mean to research Bitcoin and I mean to get involved in it.
[02:53:35.344 --> 02:53:38.846]  I mean to study the other cryptocurrencies and then I just don't want to steer you wrong.
[02:53:40.137 --> 02:53:54.426]  And because I'm too busy covering plots to kill the president and the fake Russia investigation and, you know, the stuff they're trying to shut me down, I just can't get a handle on it properly to then tell you what I think everybody should do.
[02:53:54.426 --> 02:53:55.406]  Not that you're listening to me.
[02:53:55.406 --> 02:53:56.367]  I just don't want to talk about it.
[02:53:56.367 --> 02:53:58.028]  I don't have the answers.
[02:53:58.028 --> 02:54:00.530]  But then I see Kaiser, who's been like so dead on.
[02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:06.293]  I just go, OK, I'm ready to just believe this guy knows what he's talking about because he's proven he does.
[02:54:06.293 --> 02:54:08.795]  Hell, his whole silver program brought silver up.
[02:54:09.770 --> 02:54:13.073]  With this show and others, our show is a big part of it.
[02:54:13.073 --> 02:54:17.997]  This broadcast to $50 an ounce or whatever, that really screwed up JP Morgan.
[02:54:17.997 --> 02:54:24.362]  Then they short sold it and did a bunch of naked shorting and crap.
[02:54:24.362 --> 02:54:29.186]  The power of this audience, I don't have power.
[02:54:29.186 --> 02:54:31.948]  Individually, I have great power, but I'm not the big powerful guy.
[02:54:31.948 --> 02:54:32.388]  It's us.
[02:54:33.502 --> 02:54:43.893]  And it's every color and every creed, one race, red blood, oscillating in the universe with our little brains as antennas to God, our hearts and souls.
[02:54:43.893 --> 02:54:45.495]  It's amazing.
[02:54:45.495 --> 02:54:50.400]  You know, they've proven the gut, the heart and the brain have magnetized cells in them.
[02:54:51.257 --> 02:54:54.920]  That they thought were about electrochemical communication with nerves, but they're more than that.
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:54:56.462]  They found that they're actually receivers.
[02:54:56.462 --> 02:55:00.345]  That's like they receive the sun's broadcast, the moon when the sun's on it.
[02:55:00.345 --> 02:55:02.267]  This is mainline science.
[02:55:02.267 --> 02:55:03.408]  Migratory birds have it.
[02:55:04.482 --> 02:55:11.385]  But nobody, no animals they've tested have any time close to the magnetized cells that humans have.
[02:55:11.385 --> 02:55:15.487]  We've got, and I don't understand it all, I'm just saying we're amazing folks.
[02:55:15.487 --> 02:55:17.568]  We're picking up broadcasts, we have a Sixth Sense.
[02:55:17.568 --> 02:55:19.949]  We're out in the woods for an hour and all of a sudden you feel somebody looking at you.
[02:55:19.949 --> 02:55:22.691]  You look up, there's a deer stand 500 yards away and a guy looking at you.
[02:55:22.691 --> 02:55:24.592]  I mean, we've all experienced it.
[02:55:24.592 --> 02:55:29.074]  And this is just a magical world we're in, in deep space with incredible things going on.
[02:55:29.074 --> 02:55:31.095]  We're all meant to experience each other in this
[02:55:32.273 --> 02:55:34.015]  Beyond simulation that God created.
[02:55:34.015 --> 02:55:36.878]  It's real, but it's a simulation of God.
[02:55:36.878 --> 02:55:43.164]  It's a simulation in the 3D, in the third dimension, with our minds connecting all the way up to the twelfth dimension.
[02:55:46.949 --> 02:55:50.531]  And it's just amazing to be part of this with all of you.
[02:55:50.531 --> 02:55:58.797]  I'm going to come back and hit a few other video clips I haven't got to of this amazing Jim Jordan congressman pushes up beyond ties between Peter Stroke and Trump.
[02:55:58.797 --> 02:56:00.638]  I'm going to just air the whole thing in the next segment.
[02:56:00.638 --> 02:56:03.440]  Just briefly, it's ending in the next few days.
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:06.542]  We're selling out of DNA Force, 33% off.
[02:56:06.542 --> 02:56:14.547]  We've got the toothpaste that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine, fluoride-free, super blue for adults and children and the mouthwash, 50% off.
[02:56:14.547 --> 02:56:14.927]  That's huge.

[02:56:47.972 --> 02:56:50.674]  Why fight all the garbage?

[02:57:23.224 --> 02:57:27.266]  The return of humanity being awake, not sleeping.
[02:57:27.266 --> 02:57:29.108]  They said it couldn't happen.
[02:57:29.108 --> 02:57:33.010]  They said it was the thing that should not be.
[02:57:33.010 --> 02:57:38.633]  Because with stranger eons, even death may die.
[02:57:38.633 --> 02:57:39.134]  H.P.
[02:57:39.134 --> 02:57:39.594]  Lovecraft.

[02:59:47.206 --> 02:59:49.809]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.246 --> 03:00:01.269]  We are on the march.
[03:00:01.269 --> 03:00:04.733]  The empire is on the run.
[03:00:04.733 --> 03:00:08.497]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:08.497 --> 03:00:12.762]  The whole globalist house of cards on Russiagate is coming down.
[03:00:12.762 --> 03:00:14.384]  The Democrats are eating their own.
[03:00:14.384 --> 03:00:16.106]  They're resigning en masse.
[03:00:16.106 --> 03:00:18.768]  This is a huge, huge time to be alive right now.
[03:00:19.841 --> 03:00:26.007]  We have Anthony Cumia, amazing syndicated TV and radio host, coming up that is loaded for bear in the next segment.
[03:00:26.007 --> 03:00:34.495]  But first, this entire little exchange by Jim Jordan pushes FBI on ties between the FBI Clinton operatives and the Trump surveillance.
[03:00:34.495 --> 03:00:36.096]  Here it is.
[03:00:36.096 --> 03:00:36.917]  There's been all kinds of stories.
[03:00:36.917 --> 03:00:42.462]  PolitiFact reported 96% of the top lawyers' contributions went to Clinton or Obama.
[03:00:43.257 --> 03:01:04.847]  But Peter Strzok, the guy who ran the Clinton investigation, interviewed Mills, Abedin, interviewed Secretary Clinton, changed gross negligence and crime to the term extreme carelessness, who ran the Russian investigation, who interviewed Mike Flynn, gets put on Mueller's team, and then he gets kicked off for a text message that's anti-Trump.
[03:01:04.847 --> 03:01:08.269]  If he kicked everybody off Mueller's team who was anti-Trump, I don't think there'd be anybody left.
[03:01:09.588 --> 03:01:12.849]  So here, there's gotta be something more here.
[03:01:12.849 --> 03:01:18.171]  It can't just be some text messages that show a pro-Clinton, anti-Trump bias.
[03:01:18.171 --> 03:01:20.131]  There's gotta be something more.
[03:01:20.131 --> 03:01:22.012]  And I'm trying to figure out what it is.
[03:01:22.012 --> 03:01:26.773]  But my hunch is, it has something to do with the dossier.
[03:01:26.773 --> 03:01:39.017]  Director Didd, Peter Strzok, helped produce and present the application to the FISA court to secure a warrant to spy on Americans associated with the Trump campaign.
[03:01:40.496 --> 03:01:45.719]  Congressman, I'm not prepared to discuss anything about a FISA process in this setting.
[03:01:45.719 --> 03:01:49.961]  We're not talking about what happened in the court, we're talking about what the FBI took to the court.
[03:01:49.961 --> 03:01:51.502]  The application.
[03:01:51.502 --> 03:01:55.544]  Did Peter Strzok, was he involved in taking that to the court?
[03:01:55.544 --> 03:02:00.006]  I'm not going to discuss in this setting anything to do with the FISA court applications.
[03:02:00.006 --> 03:02:02.347]  Well, let's remember a couple things, Director.
[03:02:02.347 --> 03:02:05.549]  And I know you know this, we've all been made aware of this in the last few weeks.
[03:02:05.549 --> 03:02:07.370]  Let's remember a couple things about the dossier.
[03:02:08.612 --> 03:02:30.583]  The Democrat National Committee and the Clinton campaign, which we now know were one and the same, paid the law firm, who paid Fusion GPS, who paid Christopher Steele, who then paid Russians, to put together a report that we call a dossier full of all kinds of fake news, National Enquirer garbage.
[03:02:30.583 --> 03:02:33.445]  And it's been reported that this dossier
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:35.880]  This is solid gold.
[03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:36.661]  You're all screwed.
[03:03:00.373 --> 03:03:06.862]  Congressman, our staffs have been having extensive interaction with both intelligence committees on our interaction with FISA.
[03:03:06.862 --> 03:03:09.245]  I think that's the appropriate setting for those questions.
[03:03:09.245 --> 03:03:11.007]  Here's what I think, Director Redd.
[03:03:11.007 --> 03:03:15.934]  I think Peter Strzok, head of counterintelligence at the FBI, Peter Strzok
[03:03:18.342 --> 03:03:34.991]  The guy who ran the Clinton investigation, did all the interviews, Peter Strzok, the guy who was running the Russian investigation at the FBI, Peter Strzok, Mr. Super Agent at the FBI, I think he's the guy who took the application to the FISA court.
[03:03:34.991 --> 03:03:38.013]  And if that happened, I mean, if this happened... Of course he did.
[03:03:38.013 --> 03:03:42.936]  If you had the FBI working with a campaign, the Democrats' campaign,
[03:03:44.673 --> 03:03:52.563]  Taking opposition research, dressing it all up and turning it into an intelligence document and taking it to the FISA Court so they can spy on the other campaign?
[03:03:52.563 --> 03:03:55.928]  If that happened, that is as wrong as it gets.
[03:03:55.928 --> 03:03:56.388]  And you know what?
[03:03:57.588 --> 03:03:58.369]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[03:03:58.369 --> 03:03:59.490]  You can clear it all up.
[03:03:59.490 --> 03:04:03.873]  You can clear it all up for all of us here, all the Congress who wants to know, and frankly, all of America who wants to know.
[03:04:03.873 --> 03:04:06.815]  You can clear it all up by releasing... We sent you a letter two days ago.
[03:04:06.815 --> 03:04:08.076]  Just release the application.
[03:04:08.076 --> 03:04:09.157]  Tell us what was in it.
[03:04:09.157 --> 03:04:10.478]  Tell us if I'm wrong.
[03:04:10.478 --> 03:04:11.899]  But I don't think I am.
[03:04:11.899 --> 03:04:13.721]  I think that's exactly what happened.
[03:04:13.721 --> 03:04:15.963]  And if it did, it is as wrong as it can be.
[03:04:15.963 --> 03:04:18.605]  And people who did that need to be held accountable.
[03:04:21.224 --> 03:04:32.007]  Congressman, we will not hesitate to hold people accountable after there has been an appropriate investigation, independent and objective, by the Inspector General into the handling of the prior matter.
[03:04:32.007 --> 03:04:34.827]  And based on that, I will look at all available remedies.
[03:04:34.827 --> 03:04:37.828]  Folks, that's the video that puts the final nails in the coffin.
[03:04:37.828 --> 03:04:40.109]  The Democrats are all turning against themselves right now.
[03:04:40.109 --> 03:04:42.269]  They're burning down in front of everybody.
[03:04:42.269 --> 03:04:43.469]  It's all a giant fraud.
[03:04:43.469 --> 03:04:45.350]  They're the ones in bed with the Russians.
[03:04:45.350 --> 03:04:48.591]  Mueller, all of them, Comey, the Clintons, they are a joke.
[03:04:48.591 --> 03:04:49.511]  And they went too far.
[03:04:53.348 --> 03:04:57.751]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[03:04:57.751 --> 03:05:05.857]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:05:05.857 --> 03:05:11.141]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[03:05:11.141 --> 03:05:13.663]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:05:13.663 --> 03:05:17.886]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[03:05:17.886 --> 03:05:20.328]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[03:05:21.008 --> 03:05:28.253]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[03:05:28.253 --> 03:05:35.438]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:05:36.318 --> 03:05:43.504]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[03:05:43.504 --> 03:05:44.945]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[03:05:44.945 --> 03:05:47.607]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[03:05:47.607 --> 03:05:51.069]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[03:05:51.069 --> 03:05:52.791]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[03:05:58.229 --> 03:06:05.284]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:05.284 --> 03:06:08.590]  And now, your host, Anthony Cuglia.
[03:06:17.549 --> 03:06:19.290]  Yes, welcome!
[03:06:19.290 --> 03:06:24.254]  Hi everybody, Anthony Cumia here for InfoWars.com.
[03:06:24.254 --> 03:06:31.499]  Alex, I love sitting here before my little portion of the program starts and listening to Alex.
[03:06:31.499 --> 03:06:42.346]  Just the pleasure and happiness that I share with Alex because of what's happening, what we're seeing happening to the left.
[03:06:43.095 --> 03:06:49.582]  Their one-plus-year temper tantrum continues.
[03:06:49.582 --> 03:07:02.295]  And I don't know anybody with an ounce of common sense in this country that isn't enjoying the temper tantrum and then watching the fallout from it.
[03:07:03.465 --> 03:07:12.111]  How a lot of people, again, people with common sense, were labelled horrible things over the past, over a year.
[03:07:12.111 --> 03:07:21.718]  Well over a year, and then eight years during the Obama administration, we've been labelled every kind of ist and ism that they could pull out.
[03:07:21.718 --> 03:07:32.305]  And when it became ineffective, or ineffective, when people would call you these things, and we all finally turned around and said, who cares?
[03:07:33.181 --> 03:07:36.126]  I don't care what you call me anymore.
[03:07:36.126 --> 03:07:37.788]  I believe in this.
[03:07:37.788 --> 03:07:38.970]  This is my position.
[03:07:38.970 --> 03:07:41.934]  I support this.
[03:07:41.934 --> 03:07:46.962]  They started going, oh, they're not getting upset with us anymore.
[03:07:46.962 --> 03:07:48.023]  Like a child.
[03:07:48.900 --> 03:07:50.962]  Trying to get attention from a parent.
[03:07:50.962 --> 03:07:57.329]  And Anthony, I don't mean to interrupt you while you're riffing here, because I'm just hearing my lunch watching you, but I'm going to get out of here right now, but I'm going to say this.
[03:07:57.329 --> 03:07:57.850]  Exactly.
[03:07:57.850 --> 03:08:04.937]  And you know they've reached peak tantrum when Obama came out and said Trump is Hitler and is going to commit a genocide.
[03:08:04.937 --> 03:08:07.921]  He actually said this in front of a whole crowd of people.
[03:08:07.921 --> 03:08:10.523]  Trump is Hitler and we're all going to be murdered by him.
[03:08:12.205 --> 03:08:22.414]  I mean, you know now they've really reached peak temper tantrum when now a former president has called the new president Hitler and he's going to kill all of us.
[03:08:22.414 --> 03:08:22.734]  Go ahead.
[03:08:24.398 --> 03:08:25.600]  Could you imagine?
[03:08:25.600 --> 03:08:29.445]  That is the peak of insanity.
[03:08:29.445 --> 03:08:34.192]  And I really, I compare it to childlike behavior.
[03:08:34.192 --> 03:08:41.061]  If you look at people that have children or your own children, there is a point where they want your attention.
[03:08:41.622 --> 03:08:47.828]  They want something, and when you deny it to them, they will have what is called a temper tantrum.
[03:08:47.828 --> 03:08:49.910]  And that's exactly what we're seeing.
[03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:57.837]  We are seeing people acting like absolute children trying to get daddy's attention or mommy's attention.
[03:08:57.837 --> 03:09:00.079]  And it is one of the saddest things to watch.
[03:09:00.539 --> 03:09:04.700]  And we see this has been going on for, well, since the campaign started.
[03:09:04.700 --> 03:09:08.362]  And by the way, my children never did this, but I've read the psychology books.
[03:09:08.362 --> 03:09:10.382]  It's riding on the walls with crap.
[03:09:10.382 --> 03:09:19.505]  I mean, Obama, yesterday, crapped in his hand and began riding on the walls, Hitler, and then went in front of mommy and daddy and pissed all over himself.
[03:09:19.505 --> 03:09:21.466]  I mean, I'm sorry to say it, but that's what he did.
[03:09:21.466 --> 03:09:24.507]  In fact, that didn't get their attention, so Obama shoved it in his mouth.
[03:09:28.377 --> 03:09:38.381]  It's astounding to watch this happen, and I don't want to be so happy watching it, but I can't help it.
[03:09:38.381 --> 03:09:55.630]  Because as I said, people like Alex and myself have been relegated to these isms and ologies and whatever else they could pull out to try to make us appear uncaring and insane and intolerant.
[03:09:56.110 --> 03:10:02.772]  And to see it turn around, when I saw the likes of Al Franken deliver what, what was that even supposed to be?
[03:10:02.772 --> 03:10:04.433]  An apology?
[03:10:04.433 --> 03:10:07.273]  There was no remorse whatsoever.
[03:10:07.273 --> 03:10:13.935]  Which I'm fine with, I don't like the idea that people can... No, I mean, I agree, but it's his party that made him be stampeded into this.
[03:10:13.935 --> 03:10:17.336]  What about Behar celebrating that Flynn met with the Russians during the campaign?
[03:10:17.336 --> 03:10:18.277]  Was it true?
[03:10:18.277 --> 03:10:19.617]  And then her half-hearted apology.
[03:10:19.617 --> 03:10:21.638]  I mean, they're just jokes!
[03:10:21.638 --> 03:10:22.098]  I'm sorry, I'm...
[03:10:22.478 --> 03:10:23.578]  I'm turning it over to you, my friend.
[03:10:23.578 --> 03:10:24.018]  I'm watching.
[03:10:24.018 --> 03:10:28.319]  You're absolutely on target and we really should celebrate.
[03:10:28.319 --> 03:10:33.961]  That's why I am and that's why I feel so happy about what we're seeing with the likes of Al Franken.
[03:10:33.961 --> 03:10:43.343]  I mean, when we watched him during a lot of these congressional hearings, just with complete BS coming out of his face, trying to just stoke
[03:10:45.094 --> 03:10:50.477]  Some kind of an issue with people that had done nothing but their jobs.
[03:10:50.477 --> 03:10:56.420]  And by the way, not just call the President Hitler while the economy comes back and everything, but say he's gonna genocide us!
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:10:59.481]  Genocide, Alex.
[03:10:59.481 --> 03:11:01.483]  Hitler, genocide.
[03:11:01.483 --> 03:11:24.058]  Well, they have to do this because if they commented on what Trump is actually doing with an amazing tax bill, the unemployment rate going down, GDP going up, jobs coming back to this country, things we haven't seen in years or ever happening to this country, the faith
[03:11:24.458 --> 03:11:26.079]  That Americans have.
[03:11:26.079 --> 03:11:31.222]  I hear that just more, more Christmas lights are up already this year.
[03:11:31.222 --> 03:11:34.123]  Small businesses, everything, everything.
[03:11:34.123 --> 03:11:37.925]  Well, I'm gonna get out of here and just keep watching, but I gotta say this too.
[03:11:37.925 --> 03:11:47.971]  I've got all these news articles where universities strive for Christmas-free campuses, CNN, and then they're actually saying, no, it's banned.
[03:11:47.971 --> 03:11:50.292]  So they're literally becoming the Grinch here.
[03:11:51.451 --> 03:11:52.412]  Banning.
[03:11:52.412 --> 03:11:55.854]  Are they going to ban Kwanzaa celebrations too?
[03:11:55.854 --> 03:11:59.758]  Or any Islamic celebrations?
[03:11:59.758 --> 03:12:10.106]  It's this double standard again that if you're straight, if you're white, if you're Christian, you are now the new, like they say, Hitler.
[03:12:10.106 --> 03:12:12.968]  You are literally, I like literally, literally Hitler.
[03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:18.777]  Give your traditionalists, and here's the deal, most of the so-called minorities I know who are the new, but they don't care.
[03:12:18.777 --> 03:12:19.978]  They're not even buying it.
[03:12:19.978 --> 03:12:24.425]  It's mainly weird neurotic white people that are trying to force all this insanity.
[03:12:25.339 --> 03:12:28.803]  That's what we're seeing and I don't know where it comes from.
[03:12:28.803 --> 03:12:44.879]  We said years ago when they started dishing out these trophies, these participation trophies, we said it's gonna breed a new type of person that cannot accept no for an answer, can't accept losing some type of competition,
[03:12:45.379 --> 03:12:54.994]  And we will see these little temper tantrums going on, and any inkling they have of power will be abused to the umpteenth level.
[03:12:54.994 --> 03:13:00.383]  Where, uh, you see on these college campuses, they're saying they don't want Christmas, they don't want things like, um...
[03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:03.330]  Like, it's okay to be white.
[03:13:03.330 --> 03:13:05.651]  Which, you know, you can interpret that however you want.
[03:13:05.651 --> 03:13:08.012]  They want total control of every level of civilization.
[03:13:08.012 --> 03:13:08.692]  They're a cult.
[03:13:08.692 --> 03:13:10.513]  They want language control.
[03:13:10.513 --> 03:13:14.855]  I mean, I can't stand ultra-super right-wing churches that pull that crap.
[03:13:14.855 --> 03:13:20.097]  You know, I love Jesus, I'm a Christian, but I walk out of a store and some guy's screaming and yelling, you're going to hell!
[03:13:20.097 --> 03:13:22.399]  You know, you're with that woman, it's your wife.
[03:13:22.399 --> 03:13:23.399]  I mean, they're annoying too.
[03:13:23.399 --> 03:13:25.440]  The difference is they're not running all the schools.
[03:13:25.440 --> 03:13:26.540]  They're not running my life.
[03:13:26.540 --> 03:13:27.541]  This is a real cult.
[03:13:28.632 --> 03:13:51.478]  Yeah, and we've seen it, the indoctrinations going on on college campuses, the idea that free speech is something that they can pick and choose if they just have to label something hate speech, which the criteria for that is whatever they want to come up with on the left is hate speech, and they say that that isn't protected and they have no right to speak on these campuses, and they honestly believe it!
[03:13:51.478 --> 03:13:56.879]  I've never seen such an uneducated group of people, as far as our constitutional amendments go,
[03:13:57.419 --> 03:13:57.859]  I agree.
[03:13:57.859 --> 03:14:00.941]  Speak about these things with complete ignorance.
[03:14:00.941 --> 03:14:01.561]  Let me ask you this.
[03:14:01.561 --> 03:14:02.521]  Complete confidence.
[03:14:02.521 --> 03:14:04.822]  You're about to go to break and take over.
[03:14:04.822 --> 03:14:07.263]  Again, folks, compoundmedia.com.
[03:14:07.263 --> 03:14:08.884]  Everybody should go visit, be a part of it.
[03:14:08.884 --> 03:14:09.744]  It's awesome.
[03:14:09.744 --> 03:14:11.445]  Let me ask you this question, just in one minute.
[03:14:11.445 --> 03:14:14.786]  Where does it go now, though, past insane temper tantrum?
[03:14:14.786 --> 03:14:23.770]  I mean, if Obama has gone to writing in his own feces on the wall saying that Trump's Hitler and wants to kill everybody, then, I mean, what's the next level after that?
[03:14:24.995 --> 03:14:32.281]  I don't know how much further they can go before the sane, rational people in this country really start making some noise about this.
[03:14:32.281 --> 03:14:48.014]  I think as the country goes forward and we see Trump doing such an amazing job bringing some of this tradition that made this country great back again, we're going to see more people come on board and really start pointing these people out for the mental patients that they are.
[03:14:48.474 --> 03:14:49.895]  Well, I'm proud of the West.
[03:14:49.895 --> 03:14:55.699]  The West isn't even the West until 500 years ago when it started adopting everything from other cultures that worked.
[03:14:55.699 --> 03:14:58.060]  English is a modern language of everything.
[03:14:58.060 --> 03:14:59.201]  We just take whatever works.
[03:14:59.201 --> 03:15:00.742]  Black, white, you can be part of the West.
[03:15:00.742 --> 03:15:01.842]  It doesn't matter.
[03:15:01.842 --> 03:15:04.304]  And it's all about success.
[03:15:04.304 --> 03:15:13.549]  When we say traditionalism, we meant the most cutting-edge system that produced the most choices, the most wealth, the most freedom, the most everything.
[03:15:13.549 --> 03:15:16.111]  And yeah, we'll take that over North Korea and Venezuela.
[03:15:16.331 --> 03:15:17.152]  You're damn right.
[03:15:17.152 --> 03:15:18.053]  We want it back.
[03:15:18.053 --> 03:15:19.554]  Anthony Comey had taken over.

[03:16:53.172 --> 03:16:55.633]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.
[03:16:55.633 --> 03:16:57.494]  They may look the same on the outside.
[03:16:57.494 --> 03:16:58.234]  They're stylish.

[03:17:48.451 --> 03:18:00.559]  IDStronghold.com President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel this week in a move that some say will shake the Middle East to the core.
[03:18:00.559 --> 03:18:03.801]  Israel's neighbors are extremely displeased with Trump's announcement.
[03:18:03.801 --> 03:18:09.325]  The Turkish president warned Trump that recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a red line.
[03:18:09.325 --> 03:18:12.647]  The Saudis are calling this a flagrant provocation of Muslims.
[03:18:12.647 --> 03:18:15.229]  And Palestinian leaders have already planned for protests.
[03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:27.538]  Terror group Hamas is calling for a day of rage Friday, urging Palestinians in an official Arabic statement to send a message with all available means to Israel after the upcoming Friday prayers.
[03:18:27.538 --> 03:18:29.700]  Ahead of President Trump's announcement, the U.S.
[03:18:29.700 --> 03:18:37.025]  military deployed additional forces throughout the Middle East in anticipation of widespread political unrest and even terror attacks.
[03:18:37.225 --> 03:18:38.045]  Although some U.S.
[03:18:38.045 --> 03:18:41.347]  officials had urged Trump not to make this sort of a move, U.S.
[03:18:41.347 --> 03:18:44.389]  policy should never be dictated by threats of violence.
[03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:50.372]  With the opposition against Trump's historic decision building, the days ahead could turn out to be tumultuous.

[03:21:35.472 --> 03:21:37.313]  Out of control.
[03:21:37.313 --> 03:21:41.735]  Today, a very notable day.
[03:21:41.735 --> 03:21:44.117]  December 7th.
[03:21:44.117 --> 03:21:45.037]  Back in 1941, the Japanese
[03:21:49.528 --> 03:21:55.251]  Decided it was time to bring the United States of America into WW2.
[03:21:55.251 --> 03:21:56.491]  World War 2.
[03:21:56.491 --> 03:22:08.657]  And, um, had a sneaky little attack on a little Hawaiian enclave called Pearl Harbor.
[03:22:08.657 --> 03:22:10.858]  That was 76 years ago.
[03:22:10.858 --> 03:22:15.680]  My goodness, how things have changed in 76 years.
[03:22:15.680 --> 03:22:17.641]  What we remember
[03:22:18.769 --> 03:22:40.146]  I think most what we remember when we bring up these anniversaries, especially ones that are closing in on a century mark, won't be long actually, are the amazing people, the amazing generation that answered the call.
[03:22:40.146 --> 03:22:47.312]  These are people that were standing on lines to sign up.
[03:22:48.214 --> 03:23:04.182]  To get into some, some part of the American military machine to do their part and fight for freedom and against tyranny in this world.
[03:23:04.182 --> 03:23:08.744]  And they are often brought up in conversation.
[03:23:08.744 --> 03:23:17.568]  People that had relatives and friends from the greatest generation that fought in that unbelievable conflict
[03:23:18.730 --> 03:23:21.992]  Um, so long ago.
[03:23:21.992 --> 03:23:25.153]  They are often brought up in conversation.
[03:23:25.153 --> 03:23:28.715]  What would my grandfather say?
[03:23:28.715 --> 03:23:37.640]  What would my... My grandfather fought for this or that, and he would think this or that.
[03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:47.325]  I have to assume that everyone that was on, uh, let's just say the USS Arizona, perhaps,
[03:23:49.121 --> 03:23:56.666]  on that fateful day 76 years ago was not fighting for transgender bathrooms.
[03:23:56.666 --> 03:24:06.393]  I don't think they were fighting so men dressed as women could go into the ladies room.
[03:24:06.393 --> 03:24:09.095]  I honestly don't think that.
[03:24:09.095 --> 03:24:15.019]  I don't think they were fighting so that some child
[03:24:16.013 --> 03:24:22.437]  Some childlike behavior on a college campus was preventing free speech.
[03:24:22.437 --> 03:24:26.680]  Literal and figurative book burnings going on on campuses.
[03:24:26.680 --> 03:24:31.784]  I don't think they'd have appreciated that, honestly.
[03:24:31.784 --> 03:24:37.128]  I don't think they would have appreciated a lot of these accusations going on.
[03:24:37.128 --> 03:24:39.889]  I'm not talking sexual assault.
[03:24:39.889 --> 03:24:41.711]  I'm not talking that.
[03:24:41.711 --> 03:24:43.452]  I'm talking about maybe hanging a pin-up.
[03:24:45.691 --> 03:24:47.112]  Where you work.
[03:24:47.112 --> 03:24:50.495]  I'm talking about complimenting a girl.
[03:24:50.495 --> 03:25:02.963]  These type of things, these traditional practices of American men from the greatest generation as they were called.
[03:25:02.963 --> 03:25:06.986]  You know, we talk about them as heroes.
[03:25:06.986 --> 03:25:12.010]  You look at a lot of that military equipment, especially bomber aircraft.
[03:25:12.010 --> 03:25:13.691]  Look at the nose of those planes.
[03:25:14.776 --> 03:25:27.801]  Most of them were adorned with scantily clad women, painted on the nose, with highly suggestive titles for the names of their airplanes.
[03:25:27.801 --> 03:25:38.526]  In today's society, these men, these heroes, flying missions where many did not come back, would be called horrible people!
[03:25:39.233 --> 03:25:40.294]  Yellow Rose.
[03:25:40.294 --> 03:25:41.515]  Yellow Rose of Texas.
[03:25:41.515 --> 03:25:42.676]  There she is.
[03:25:42.676 --> 03:25:45.497]  With her little bippy top.
[03:25:45.497 --> 03:25:48.339]  Her little shorts.
[03:25:48.339 --> 03:25:56.345]  Those men climbed into these machines with a great possibility that they were not coming back.
[03:25:56.345 --> 03:25:57.626]  And painted these things.
[03:25:57.626 --> 03:26:04.691]  These were parts of American tradition that would be looked at now as abominations.
[03:26:05.513 --> 03:26:07.897]  And a sexist and everything.
[03:26:07.897 --> 03:26:10.942]  Heavenly body, there she is!
[03:26:10.942 --> 03:26:16.872]  You think George Willet, Mr. what do they call him, Crafty?
[03:26:17.964 --> 03:26:24.709]  You think he would be tolerant to somebody spray-painting over that, maybe?
[03:26:24.709 --> 03:26:34.676]  Maybe he's just ready to take off and go on a bombing mission over Dresden, or something, and some liberal walks up and goes, NO!
[03:26:34.676 --> 03:26:38.619]  And spray-paints over his nose art?
[03:26:38.619 --> 03:26:41.041]  That's wrong, man!
[03:26:44.506 --> 03:27:06.781]  So anytime you bring up any of these amazing men who fought the F-bomb, that's clever, bring up any of these amazing men that fought in this amazing conflict that we were brought into 76 years ago today, let's not forget, wow, that guy's good, huh?
[03:27:06.781 --> 03:27:08.803]  That's an amazing little painting.
[03:27:08.803 --> 03:27:10.204]  Nice stems!
[03:27:10.204 --> 03:27:11.825]  Nice stems on that dame!
[03:27:14.548 --> 03:27:23.533]  Anytime you bring that up, just remember, don't try to imagine what they would or wouldn't be fighting for today.
[03:27:23.533 --> 03:27:40.863]  Because I would have to assume, and again, I don't know, but based on what I know and the knowledge I have of that generation and what they were fighting for at the time, I think American traditionalism and greatness
[03:27:41.787 --> 03:27:49.914]  A commonality of patriotism, nationalism, and freedom?
[03:27:49.914 --> 03:28:02.305]  I think that's probably what got those guys to squeeze their asses into that narrow plane, knowing there was a great chance they would not be coming back.
[03:28:02.305 --> 03:28:09.171]  Again, not so some guy named Bob can put a wig on and pee sitting down.
[03:28:10.774 --> 03:28:13.655]  In a public bathroom.
[03:28:13.655 --> 03:28:39.265]  I don't know any of those men from interviews I've seen and documentaries that ran out of that amphibious vehicle or that landing craft onto a beach in France saying, yes, also Bob can put on a wig and urinate next to women in a bathroom.
[03:28:41.388 --> 03:28:48.176]  It was the amazingness of America and American ideals that those men were fighting for.
[03:28:48.176 --> 03:28:48.876]  And freedom.
[03:28:48.876 --> 03:28:50.258]  Sacrifice!

[03:33:27.747 --> 03:33:30.969]  Greetings, greetings, welcome back everybody.
[03:33:30.969 --> 03:33:33.551]  Anthony Cumia at Infowars.com.
[03:33:37.153 --> 03:33:50.965]  We're just talking about the, uh, the amazing, greatest generation ever, World War II, um, on this, uh, anniversary, 76th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese.
[03:33:50.965 --> 03:33:53.127]  Uh, and look, we're all getting along now.
[03:33:53.127 --> 03:34:00.874]  Japan, one of our greatest allies down there in, uh, the South Pacific, as it were.
[03:34:00.874 --> 03:34:03.116]  Um, yeah, they're just, uh,
[03:34:03.866 --> 03:34:06.067]  An amazing time in history.
[03:34:06.067 --> 03:34:19.632]  The sacrifice and commitment by the American people to fight tyranny that was, you know, an ocean away on either side of us.
[03:34:19.632 --> 03:34:24.274]  But, you know, we knew what a good cause was.
[03:34:25.310 --> 03:34:32.936]  We knew right from wrong and good from bad and it was a lot clearer back then than it is now.
[03:34:32.936 --> 03:34:38.781]  A travesty of justice happened last week in San Francisco.
[03:34:38.781 --> 03:34:46.707]  The Garcia Zarate case, of course, Kate Steinle murdered.
[03:34:46.707 --> 03:34:53.293]  I don't care what the verdict was, that she was murdered in San Francisco.
[03:34:54.612 --> 03:35:00.776]  And he got off pretty much with a slap on the wrist at that trial.
[03:35:00.776 --> 03:35:05.399]  Hopefully a federal trial will turn out a little differently.
[03:35:05.399 --> 03:35:09.362]  This is a guy that was deported five times.
[03:35:09.362 --> 03:35:21.290]  He was in the city of San Francisco, a sanctuary city, where they feel that the laws of the land don't apply to them.
[03:35:21.290 --> 03:35:23.031]  That somebody breaking the law
[03:35:24.133 --> 03:35:32.078]  Can just go about their business and continue breaking that law with impunity.
[03:35:32.078 --> 03:35:45.567]  And the end of that whole thing ended up with a beautiful woman, a contributing member of society, being murdered by this guy.
[03:35:45.567 --> 03:35:47.348]  As if that wasn't bad enough!
[03:35:48.718 --> 03:35:56.303]  He's put on trial through this justice system that is supposed to work in this country.
[03:35:56.303 --> 03:36:01.667]  And they do not find him guilty of murder or manslaughter.
[03:36:01.667 --> 03:36:02.127]  Amazing.
[03:36:02.127 --> 03:36:03.748]  He picked up a gun.
[03:36:03.748 --> 03:36:07.590]  A gun that was stolen.
[03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:11.053]  He picked up a stolen gun.
[03:36:11.053 --> 03:36:17.397]  His actions were responsible for that gun going off and shooting that woman.
[03:36:18.413 --> 03:36:20.855]  Okay.
[03:36:20.855 --> 03:36:30.140]  And he goes to trial in San Francisco, and they do not find him guilty of murder or manslaughter.
[03:36:30.140 --> 03:36:39.146]  And this brings up another huge problem we are having with 2017 United States of America.
[03:36:39.146 --> 03:36:40.366]  We've heard this for years.
[03:36:40.366 --> 03:36:42.768]  A jury of our peers
[03:36:43.536 --> 03:36:54.786]  When you are committing, uh, when you've committed a crime, you're charged with a crime, you are entitled to a trial in front of a jury of your peers.
[03:36:54.786 --> 03:36:58.910]  Now, first of all, this guy is an illegal alien.
[03:36:58.910 --> 03:37:01.292]  Who are his peers?
[03:37:01.292 --> 03:37:07.758]  Should we just go down and pluck some people out of Mexico and have them sit in judgment of this man?
[03:37:08.832 --> 03:37:18.515]  No, a jury of our peers are supposed to be, this was what it was supposed to be and what it was for many years and what it turned into.
[03:37:18.515 --> 03:37:19.955]  Something completely different.
[03:37:19.955 --> 03:37:30.638]  A jury of our peers are people, it doesn't mean white or black or of certain ethnic backgrounds or places.
[03:37:30.638 --> 03:37:33.239]  What it is, is there's a commonality there.
[03:37:34.888 --> 03:37:40.853]  Your peership with these people are the fact that we are Americans.
[03:37:40.853 --> 03:37:51.343]  We have a common thread of country, culture, language, tradition, values.
[03:37:51.343 --> 03:37:57.608]  We know what is innately good and bad, right and wrong.
[03:37:57.608 --> 03:38:02.032]  We have a want to make things better.
[03:38:03.501 --> 03:38:13.488]  And we want the laws of this land enforced fairly, and we want justice administered.
[03:38:13.488 --> 03:38:26.797]  That's what the peership is supposed to be in those 12 people sitting in judgment of the person on trial.
[03:38:26.797 --> 03:38:31.000]  This doesn't exist anymore.
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:32.141]  When you fill up
[03:38:33.226 --> 03:38:45.413]  A jury box, when lawyers pick a jury, they are looking for people that have no concept of everything I just mentioned.
[03:38:45.413 --> 03:38:57.641]  Any type of united front where you're a peer of the person on trial because of your common ethics.
[03:38:58.877 --> 03:39:06.180]  And morality and value system based on being an American.
[03:39:06.180 --> 03:39:17.325]  So how could these people possibly come up with a verdict that is fair and based on those things if they don't even believe in them?
[03:39:17.325 --> 03:39:26.930]  If they're plucked from this city of San Francisco, which believes in something like a sanctuary for criminals,
[03:39:27.972 --> 03:39:39.654]  They actually have a belief system that if you're breaking the law, we will not do anything about it because you vote Democratic?
[03:39:39.654 --> 03:39:43.855]  You'll raise kids that'll vote Democratic?
[03:39:43.855 --> 03:39:50.456]  I even find it difficult to try to figure out why, what's the motivation for this thing?
[03:39:50.456 --> 03:39:51.977]  But it is true.
[03:39:51.977 --> 03:39:54.177]  There is no common thread
[03:39:54.835 --> 03:40:07.924]  through the juries in the American judicial system anymore that leads them to a conclusion based on the facts that they heard that is fair and just.
[03:40:07.924 --> 03:40:10.186]  It doesn't exist anymore.
[03:40:10.186 --> 03:40:18.812]  And that is a scary, scary prospect for anyone that is up on any type of charges.
[03:40:18.812 --> 03:40:23.756]  Not only if you're innocent, if you are somebody that they deem
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:37.544]  A social pariah in San Francisco, which at this point is anyone who is perhaps white, straight, successful.
[03:40:37.544 --> 03:40:44.727]  If you're any one of those, you already have a jury that probably is pitted against you.
[03:40:44.727 --> 03:40:51.909]  So if you're innocent and have to go before a jury that isn't a jury of your peers, there's a problem there.
[03:40:51.909 --> 03:40:53.870]  And just like that, if you're
[03:40:54.782 --> 03:40:58.264]  Uh, up on charges and you're guilty.
[03:40:58.264 --> 03:41:01.646]  You're a criminal just for being in this country.
[03:41:01.646 --> 03:41:08.429]  And you have a jury that is so sympathetic because they don't believe in the value system that we have in this country.
[03:41:08.429 --> 03:41:11.650]  That's a scary prospect too.
[03:41:11.650 --> 03:41:14.452]  Uh, I don't see where it ends.
[03:41:15.912 --> 03:41:22.496]  Hopefully with this momentum that we're getting, that started with the election of Donald Trump.
[03:41:22.496 --> 03:41:26.658]  It's funny to say, and I know some people say that, and people goof on them.
[03:41:26.658 --> 03:41:28.939]  Wow, he's an idiot, he's this, that, and the other thing.
[03:41:28.939 --> 03:41:43.847]  Regardless of what you think Donald Trump is, he has turned this country on its head, peeling away the layers of bull that we have been living in, exposing
[03:41:44.565 --> 03:41:53.790]  There's so much of the hypocrisy and outright criminality going on in the government and the mainstream media.
[03:41:53.790 --> 03:42:05.395]  And hopefully that momentum will catch on and we will start seeing a change in certain areas like these sanctuary cities.
[03:42:05.395 --> 03:42:12.459]  Where is somebody supposed to get a fair trial when the jury box is loaded with people that don't share
[03:42:13.855 --> 03:42:19.199]  That ideology and that faith in the system.
[03:42:19.199 --> 03:42:29.187]  There is literally a hatred of the very system that they're sitting in judgment on.
[03:42:29.187 --> 03:42:36.193]  And I can only imagine having to turn around and look at a jury when you know they just have such disdain
[03:42:37.006 --> 03:42:40.588]  for the system in place that they are participating in.
[03:42:40.588 --> 03:42:43.049]  Scary prospect, my friends.
[03:42:43.049 --> 03:42:45.330]  We'll be back in a matter of moments.
[03:42:45.330 --> 03:42:46.371]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:46.371 --> 03:42:49.192]  Anthony Cumia in at InfoWars.com.
[03:42:49.192 --> 03:42:49.933]  See you in seconds.

[03:43:03.668 --> 03:43:12.593]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a

[03:43:55.063 --> 03:44:04.170]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[03:44:04.170 --> 03:44:05.552]  So what do we do about it?

[03:48:29.752 --> 03:48:30.513]  Welcome.
[03:48:30.513 --> 03:48:34.076]  Anthony Cumia, InfoWars.com.
[03:48:34.076 --> 03:48:36.178]  Um, we are in...
[03:48:37.478 --> 03:48:47.832]  A most insane, crazy, backwards, bizarro world that in some of these stories that I read on a daily basis, I'm stunned.
[03:48:47.832 --> 03:48:51.316]  Even today, I get stunned still.
[03:48:51.316 --> 03:48:52.498]  I'm used to it.
[03:48:52.498 --> 03:48:54.380]  I've seen lots of these stories.
[03:48:54.380 --> 03:48:55.622]  But this is, um...
[03:48:56.844 --> 03:48:58.245]  Pure insanity.
[03:48:58.245 --> 03:49:08.790]  Apparently in the great city of brotherly love, which is just one of the greatest ironies I've ever, ever heard in my life, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[03:49:08.790 --> 03:49:12.712]  Some call it Killadelphia.
[03:49:12.712 --> 03:49:25.138]  A politician here, City Councilwoman Cindy Bass, she is looking to remove bulletproof glass
[03:49:26.363 --> 03:49:33.126]  That you see in a lot of these convenience stores and liquor stores in urban areas.
[03:49:33.126 --> 03:49:40.809]  You'll see a lot of these people work with everything behind bulletproof glass.
[03:49:40.809 --> 03:49:42.949]  Now, I'm silly.
[03:49:42.949 --> 03:49:44.550]  I'm silly.
[03:49:44.550 --> 03:49:53.053]  I would assume, and maybe I'm wrong, that you don't just all of a sudden put bulletproof glass up in your business.
[03:49:53.053 --> 03:49:54.634]  I go to a lot of stores
[03:49:55.953 --> 03:50:00.477]  Places of business where I've never seen bulletproof glass.
[03:50:00.477 --> 03:50:04.420]  I should ask the person, why haven't you installed bulletproof glass here?
[03:50:04.420 --> 03:50:11.826]  I'm assuming again, maybe I'd get the answer, we've never, ever, ever had somebody try to shoot us.
[03:50:11.826 --> 03:50:15.549]  Which would be reasonable, why go through the cost of putting up the bulletproof glass?
[03:50:15.549 --> 03:50:22.675]  But in Killadelphia, where armed robberies and assaults and murders are rampant,
[03:50:23.718 --> 03:50:33.623]  Some of these business owners have decided, look, I'm gonna put a barrier between myself and people who wish to kill me!
[03:50:33.623 --> 03:50:47.589]  And they could give their money, and I could give the merchandise through a little portal through this thing, but I'll be safe from the unbelievable violence that is happening in this city.
[03:50:47.589 --> 03:50:49.310]  Well, Cindy Bass!
[03:50:50.203 --> 03:50:55.126]  Says right now the plexiglass has to come down.
[03:50:55.126 --> 03:51:06.413]  She says she wants to put some controls on these small stores that from her point of view sell booze, very little food, and are a source of trouble for the district.
[03:51:06.413 --> 03:51:08.494]  There she is.
[03:51:08.494 --> 03:51:12.857]  We want to make sure that there isn't this sort of indignity
[03:51:13.954 --> 03:51:22.741]  In my opinion, to serving food through a plexiglass only in certain neighborhoods.
[03:51:22.741 --> 03:51:32.189]  The crazy, bizarro, backwards world of Cindy Bass dictates that it is degrading
[03:51:34.777 --> 03:51:48.026]  And in somehow an indignity to want to protect your life and the lives of your workers and family that might be working at your store.
[03:51:48.026 --> 03:52:00.314]  So instead of having the choice to defend yourself in the way that you deem fit, and in this case would be bulletproof glass, she's saying no.
[03:52:00.314 --> 03:52:03.976]  Through nothing more than political correctness, she wants this removed.
[03:52:05.204 --> 03:52:08.086]  Uh, there is a man, Rich Kim.
[03:52:08.086 --> 03:52:09.427]  Rich Kim.
[03:52:09.427 --> 03:52:13.029]  He, um, resents the story.
[03:52:13.029 --> 03:52:17.852]  Um, this, uh, this, uh, policy she wants to enact.
[03:52:17.852 --> 03:52:21.634]  Saying that, uh, the most important thing is safety.
[03:52:21.634 --> 03:52:29.539]  And he says, if the glass comes down, the crime rate will rise and there will be a lot of dead bodies.
[03:52:29.539 --> 03:52:33.142]  Now, honestly, a lot of these stores are owned by Koreans.
[03:52:34.338 --> 03:52:47.003]  Korean store owners and they have been the focus of a lot of abuse at the hands of the very community in which they are brave enough to bring business into.
[03:52:47.003 --> 03:52:51.785]  It's either Rich Kim or you don't get your lottery tickets.
[03:52:51.785 --> 03:53:00.668]  That's pretty much the bottom line in a lot of these inner city bodegas and stores like this, these small stores.
[03:53:01.986 --> 03:53:07.047]  Kim's family's run a deli which sells soda snacks, meals, beer for 20 years.
[03:53:07.047 --> 03:53:13.108]  He said the glass went up after a shooting and claims it saved his mother-in-law from a knife attack.
[03:53:13.108 --> 03:53:18.049]  Now he may be forced to take the barriers down.
[03:53:18.049 --> 03:53:27.411]  Can anyone come up with a logical reason why you shouldn't have these things?
[03:53:28.849 --> 03:53:34.311]  Based on nothing more than political correctness and politics.
[03:53:34.311 --> 03:53:43.675]  This woman is trying to ingratiate herself with her constituency, which I guess are made up of a lot of people that don't like the bulletproof glass.
[03:53:43.675 --> 03:53:45.556]  I guess it cuts in on business.
[03:53:45.556 --> 03:53:51.358]  If you're trying to rob a place and you walk in and there's bulletproof glass, it's just someone interfering with your livelihood.
[03:53:51.358 --> 03:53:53.899]  This is interfering with people's jobs!
[03:53:53.899 --> 03:53:56.620]  I'm a professional robber, and I don't like this.
[03:53:58.035 --> 03:54:05.782]  Again, Liberals and Democrats trying to keep you from defending yourself in the best way possible.
[03:54:05.782 --> 03:54:09.286]  Which brings me to this story, which I love.
[03:54:09.286 --> 03:54:14.811]  They want concealed carry reciprocity to reciprocate.
[03:54:14.811 --> 03:54:16.312]  Each state will reciprocate.
[03:54:16.312 --> 03:54:21.137]  If you have a permit to carry a concealed weapon in the state of Pennsylvania,
[03:54:21.883 --> 03:54:30.707]  You should be able to drive over the border to New Jersey and still have the ability to protect yourself with your concealed handgun.
[03:54:30.707 --> 03:54:37.270]  This has been something that has gone to states' rights for many years.
[03:54:37.270 --> 03:54:42.813]  If you look at the Second Amendment, the shall not be infringed is fairly clear.
[03:54:42.813 --> 03:54:46.234]  Shall not be infringed means shall not be infringed.
[03:54:46.234 --> 03:54:48.915]  So they're looking to pass this.
[03:54:48.915 --> 03:54:49.996]  The House passed it already.
[03:54:50.888 --> 03:54:55.391]  It goes to the Senate and I really hope this passes.
[03:54:55.391 --> 03:55:02.254]  This is key to American people being able to defend themselves no matter where they are.
[03:55:02.254 --> 03:55:12.960]  If you go through all of the background checks and what have you that it takes to get a concealed carry in a state, why shouldn't you be able to go to another state?
[03:55:13.815 --> 03:55:22.638]  It's the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment of the United States of America that allows you to bear arms.
[03:55:22.638 --> 03:55:33.821]  A state's right should not be able to take away your rights that are God-given as a human being.
[03:55:33.821 --> 03:55:36.182]  And in this country, there it is.
[03:55:36.983 --> 03:55:38.204]  The Second Amendment.
[03:55:38.204 --> 03:55:40.425]  Oh, they always get on that militia part.
[03:55:40.425 --> 03:55:43.026]  But it says a well-regulated militia!
[03:55:43.026 --> 03:55:51.171]  Yes, comma, being necessary to the security of a free state, comma, the right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:55:51.171 --> 03:55:57.494]  Because an armed populace are the only people that can form a well-regulated militia.
[03:55:58.445 --> 03:56:01.087]  It doesn't say you need the militia to be armed.
[03:56:01.087 --> 03:56:04.670]  Obviously you need to be armed to form the militia.
[03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:09.414]  That's what the actual amendment dictates.
[03:56:09.414 --> 03:56:13.778]  And the Supreme Court has agreed with that, mind you.
[03:56:13.778 --> 03:56:16.140]  But this is fantastic.
[03:56:16.140 --> 03:56:17.121]  The ability
[03:56:17.995 --> 03:56:26.681]  For you, as an American, to protect yourself and your loved ones in the best possible way you want to.
[03:56:26.681 --> 03:56:31.464]  Now, if you believe that that is a baseball bat next to your bed, so be it.
[03:56:31.464 --> 03:56:36.527]  No one's forcing you to arm yourself with a handgun.
[03:56:36.527 --> 03:56:44.012]  But if you want to be on even footing with somebody that perhaps enters your house that's armed, your car that is armed,
[03:56:45.190 --> 03:56:50.813]  I don't know about you, but I'd want to be on as equal a footing with that person as possible.
[03:56:50.813 --> 03:57:08.740]  If you're a slight woman, perhaps, and a burly man comes in that obviously could subdue you with his physical strength, don't you want something, the ability, the choice for yourself to make based on your constitutional rights to protect yourself?
[03:57:08.740 --> 03:57:10.261]  Why should a state
[03:57:10.945 --> 03:57:18.037]  Some politician decide for you how best you should defend yourself and your loved ones.
[03:57:19.136 --> 03:57:20.977]  Absolutely unconstitutional.
[03:57:20.977 --> 03:57:27.659]  So when I see a bill like this, this is real meat and potatoes politics here.
[03:57:27.659 --> 03:57:38.204]  And I really love that this administration is pushing forward and giving Americans back the rights that they are given by being born in this amazing country of ours.

[03:58:46.786 --> 03:59:01.375]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[03:59:01.375 --> 03:59:08.640]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[03:59:08.960 --> 03:59:09.481]  Well, thank you.
[03:59:09.481 --> 03:59:14.405]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[03:59:14.405 --> 03:59:17.367]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[03:59:17.367 --> 03:59:20.630]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:26.775]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[03:59:26.775 --> 03:59:29.318]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[03:59:30.038 --> 03:59:36.883]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
