[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:11.640 --> 00:19.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:19.040 --> 00:22.960]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Sunday, October 25, 2015.
[00:22.960 --> 00:24.680]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:24.680 --> 00:26.680]  We have a lot of breaking news.
[00:26.680 --> 00:29.000]  The BLM is at it again.
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.480]  The same people that came after the ranchers, the cowboys, the farmers, the miners, now
[00:35.480 --> 00:39.280]  are coming after the horses.
[00:39.280 --> 00:42.160]  And this is also an illegal operation that they've got going on here.
[00:42.160 --> 00:45.000]  And of course, we have some updates as well.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.800]  There's also Department of the Secretary of the Interior, the Department of the Interior
[00:49.800 --> 00:52.960]  that is in charge of the catastrophe at that gold mine.
[00:52.960 --> 00:55.960]  It was miners in Oregon, you remember, that they were going to shut down because they
[00:55.960 --> 00:59.880]  were just too concerned about any tiny spillovers.
[00:59.880 --> 01:03.000]  So then they go to another area to a gold mine.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.280]  And even though a retired engineer said what they were proposing to do was going to explode,
[01:08.280 --> 01:11.480]  he did it about a month, I think, before they actually did the operation.
[01:11.480 --> 01:14.300]  He said, of course, they're going to do it anyway, and they're going to use this as an
[01:14.300 --> 01:17.640]  excuse to increase the size of the bureaucracy.
[01:17.640 --> 01:22.400]  And now we see that the Indians downstream, this went through several states, massive pollution
[01:22.400 --> 01:27.480]  of heavy metals from the explosion that the EPA caused, again, the EPA as well as the
[01:27.480 --> 01:30.800]  BLM under the Department of the Interior.
[01:30.800 --> 01:34.760]  This massive explosion that released all of this heavy metal into the river that polluted
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.480]  the river through multiple states is now going into the lands of the Navajo Indians.
[01:40.480 --> 01:42.320]  And they could care less about that.
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.040]  They said, you're not going to get any help from the EPA, you're not going to get any
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  help from FEMA.
[01:47.040 --> 01:50.560]  We're just going to destroy your drinking water.
[01:50.560 --> 01:51.560]  That's the way the government rolls.
[01:51.560 --> 01:56.160]  We're also going to take a look at politics because we've got some new polls showing that
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.840]  Ben Carson is now taking the lead in Iowa, and he is beating the drum about an intensified
[02:01.840 --> 02:02.840]  drug war.
[02:02.840 --> 02:08.080]  Yes, maybe Ben has been under anesthesia for the last 44 years.
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.560]  Ben, the drug war doesn't work.
[02:10.560 --> 02:12.840]  You need to understand it doesn't work.
[02:12.840 --> 02:14.240]  We're going to talk about why it doesn't work.
[02:14.240 --> 02:19.200]  We're going to talk about why Ben Carson doesn't seem to understand the Constitution or individual
[02:19.200 --> 02:20.200]  liberty.
[02:20.200 --> 02:24.440]  We're also looking at Jeb Bush's campaign is collapsing.
[02:24.440 --> 02:27.800]  But when questioned about it, he says, blah, blah, blah.
[02:27.800 --> 02:28.800]  That's my response.
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.200]  Kind of like, I guess, in that first debate when he said they call me Jeb and I earned
[02:32.200 --> 02:33.200]  that.
[02:33.200 --> 02:35.800]  I still don't understand what that comment meant.
[02:35.800 --> 02:38.560]  But yeah, his response was blah, blah, blah.
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.520]  And then he goes on to say that if he wasn't running for president, taking all this flack
[02:42.520 --> 02:45.840]  from Donald Trump, he could be doing some really cool things.
[02:45.840 --> 02:51.360]  Well, we want to encourage Jeb Bush to go explore those really cool things.
[02:51.360 --> 02:52.840]  Who knows what he might be doing?
[02:52.840 --> 02:56.240]  Maybe he'll be parachuting out of airplanes like his dad used to do.
[02:56.240 --> 02:57.960]  But let's encourage him to do that.
[02:57.960 --> 03:00.280]  We've got an update from Tony Blair.
[03:00.280 --> 03:04.080]  He's now issued an apology for Iraq.
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.080]  Well, kind of, not really.
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.600]  He says, I'm sorry that I acted on bad intelligence that was given to me by other people.
[03:10.600 --> 03:13.280]  That's as close as you're going to get to an apology from any of these people.
[03:13.280 --> 03:16.320]  We're going to look at what happened in detail with Tony Blair.
[03:16.320 --> 03:19.880]  We're going to look at the long history of the buildup to Iraq.
[03:19.880 --> 03:21.080]  We'll point out that.
[03:21.080 --> 03:27.440]  But I also want to tie it in with a documentary that I saw yesterday.
[03:27.440 --> 03:32.280]  It was essentially about a back and forth between charter schools and public schools.
[03:32.280 --> 03:33.600]  What can go wrong with charter schools?
[03:33.600 --> 03:37.760]  Looking at some of the crony capitalism problems that you get when you have the government
[03:37.760 --> 03:41.080]  financing charter schools.
[03:41.080 --> 03:43.960]  And they looked at the Fatala Ghulain schools.
[03:43.960 --> 03:47.120]  Fatala Ghulain is a man who came from Turkey.
[03:47.120 --> 03:48.120]  We'll talk about that.
[03:48.120 --> 03:54.680]  And we'll talk about the fact that this is one of the largest networks of charter schools
[03:54.680 --> 03:58.320]  in the world and in the country and in Texas.
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.400]  It was just recently surpassed by another charter school group in Texas.
[04:03.400 --> 04:06.880]  But they have over a thousand schools worldwide.
[04:06.880 --> 04:13.480]  This is a radical Turkish Imam who was kicked out of Turkey because they were concerned
[04:13.480 --> 04:18.200]  that he wanted to set up an Islamic State, a transnational caliphate.
[04:18.200 --> 04:19.520]  Does that sound familiar?
[04:19.520 --> 04:22.280]  Actually, that happened back in 1999.
[04:22.280 --> 04:24.600]  When they kicked him out of Turkey, where do you think he went?
[04:24.600 --> 04:27.600]  He went to the United States.
[04:27.600 --> 04:29.520]  Who got him into the United States?
[04:29.520 --> 04:31.000]  The CIA.
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.200]  The CIA wrote letters of accommodations for this fellow who has now, through his network
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.080]  of charter schools, ripped off the American public to the tune of half a billion dollars.
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.440]  And this is a guy who wants to put out the Islamic Caliphate State, not just training
[04:45.440 --> 04:47.920]  terrorists, just educating the next generation of terrorists.
[04:47.920 --> 05:17.680]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[05:17.680 --> 05:19.680]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[05:28.120 --> 05:29.120]  Brain force is here.
[05:29.120 --> 05:31.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[05:31.320 --> 05:35.360]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because
[05:35.360 --> 05:36.360]  of brain force.
[05:36.360 --> 05:39.480]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[05:39.480 --> 05:42.920]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[05:42.920 --> 05:45.040]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[05:45.040 --> 05:46.040]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.040]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.160]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[06:16.840 --> 06:18.080]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:18.080 --> 06:21.320]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, October 25th, 2015.
[06:21.320 --> 06:27.600]  As I mentioned in the last segment, we're going to talk about the latest BLM illegal
[06:27.600 --> 06:33.400]  operation, killing 2,000 horses that are protected, wild horses.
[06:33.400 --> 06:38.600]  It was an illegal operation, but even more interesting is how much money was made by
[06:38.600 --> 06:40.120]  an individual.
[06:40.120 --> 06:44.560]  And then the fact that the Office of Inspector General doesn't really want to investigate
[06:44.560 --> 06:45.560]  this.
[06:45.560 --> 06:50.880]  And most interesting, but before we do, I want to talk about the latest updates that
[06:50.880 --> 06:52.320]  we have coming out of the Middle East.
[06:52.320 --> 06:59.520]  We've got Tony Blair in an article on infowars.com from RT acknowledging that ISIS stemmed from
[06:59.520 --> 07:03.120]  the Iraq invasion, but he refuses to apologize for toppling Saddam.
[07:03.120 --> 07:07.800]  He says, I can say that I apologize for the fact that the intelligence we received was
[07:07.800 --> 07:08.800]  wrong.
[07:08.800 --> 07:11.200]  In other words, he's not apologizing.
[07:11.200 --> 07:13.040]  He's simply passing the buck.
[07:13.040 --> 07:17.560]  Of course, Hillary Clinton never apologizes, never even comes that close to an apology.
[07:17.560 --> 07:22.080]  And we're going to talk some more about the lies of the Benghazi hearing that we heard
[07:22.080 --> 07:25.880]  the other day, as well as the concerns about her health.
[07:25.880 --> 07:29.720]  I think legitimate concerns that have been brought up by Matt Drudge, the Washington
[07:29.720 --> 07:31.280]  Post pushed back on that.
[07:31.280 --> 07:35.160]  And then Drudge yesterday pushed back on what the Washington Post said.
[07:35.160 --> 07:37.160]  So we're going to have the back and forth of that.
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.080]  We're also going to play a little bit of what Drudge was referring to when he talked about
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.880]  there were issues of her health that were maybe the most important things that came
[07:45.880 --> 07:47.960]  out of the Benghazi hearings.
[07:47.960 --> 07:51.640]  But before we get to Hillary Clinton, before we get to the BLM, I want to take a look at
[07:51.640 --> 07:56.160]  what's going on with this Blair non-admission of problems.
[07:56.160 --> 08:00.040]  He says, I find it hard to apologize for removing Saddam.
[08:00.040 --> 08:06.760]  I think even from today in 2015, it's better that he's not there than that he is there.
[08:06.760 --> 08:09.320]  And I would have to say exactly how.
[08:09.320 --> 08:14.400]  Can you stop and think about the massive amount of blood and money that has been spent, the
[08:14.400 --> 08:20.800]  massive amount of innocent lives that have been spent, the pollution of Fallujah with
[08:20.800 --> 08:26.600]  weapons of depleted uranium that's causing birth defects, things that are going to happen
[08:26.600 --> 08:29.400]  and continue to happen for generations.
[08:29.400 --> 08:31.360]  How do you justify something like that?
[08:31.360 --> 08:37.800]  And of course, when I look at Tony Blair confessing to what he says is blowback and then not even
[08:37.800 --> 08:40.520]  really taking responsibility for making the decision.
[08:40.520 --> 08:45.480]  Look, those people work for you, as Harry Truman said, the buck stops with you.
[08:45.480 --> 08:50.080]  If you hire the intelligence people, if they're your people, they're producing the intelligence,
[08:50.080 --> 08:54.720]  you trust them, you don't want to vet that intelligence yourself personally, you're still
[08:54.720 --> 08:55.720]  responsible.
[08:55.720 --> 08:56.720]  You're ultimately responsible.
[08:56.720 --> 08:58.400]  You're the one pushing this war.
[08:58.400 --> 09:03.920]  And we know from just released memos that Tony Blair was conspiring with George W. Bush
[09:03.920 --> 09:06.320]  a year in advance of this all happening.
[09:06.320 --> 09:08.960]  This was something they're working on for a very long time.
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.000]  But of course, what he would like to do is he would like to have you continue to focus
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.600]  on the fact that mistakes are made, that this is all part of a blowback, that ISIS came
[09:18.600 --> 09:23.920]  from bad policy, that bad policy came from bad intelligence.
[09:23.920 --> 09:27.560]  That's simply not the case, not the case at all.
[09:27.560 --> 09:29.120]  This is not blowback.
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.680]  This is criminal conspiracy to create ISIS.
[09:32.680 --> 09:34.240]  This is what we're looking at here.
[09:34.240 --> 09:38.680]  I think it's interesting, go back and look at a documentary film called The Fog of War
[09:38.680 --> 09:41.200]  that was done by Errol Morris, a very good documentarian.
[09:41.200 --> 09:48.600]  He did another film called A Thin Blue Line that was about the murder of a police officer,
[09:48.600 --> 09:51.720]  a guy that was sitting on death row.
[09:51.720 --> 09:56.400]  And when Errol Morris looked and investigated this case and started looking at the facts
[09:56.400 --> 09:58.400]  of it, he found they had the wrong man.
[09:58.400 --> 10:02.320]  They were interested in getting somebody punished for the death of this police officer, but
[10:02.320 --> 10:03.320]  it was the wrong man.
[10:03.320 --> 10:06.280]  And actually, this is actually really an amazing documentary.
[10:06.280 --> 10:11.920]  He got the person who actually did the murder to confess when he was interviewing him for
[10:11.920 --> 10:12.920]  the documentary.
[10:12.920 --> 10:14.400]  So that's the Thin Blue Line.
[10:14.400 --> 10:17.240]  He followed that up with a lot of good documentaries.
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.000]  I think the best was The Fog of War.
[10:20.000 --> 10:21.840]  And that was about Robert McNamara.
[10:21.840 --> 10:27.420]  And again, he had this setup, he called it the enterotron.
[10:27.420 --> 10:34.000]  And it was kind of like a teleprompter, except that instead of them seeing what they're supposed
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.480]  to read, and it's a TV announcer is typically the way the anchors typically do it.
[10:39.480 --> 10:43.960]  We don't use teleprompters here, but in most news organizations, they will have everything
[10:43.960 --> 10:44.960]  written out for them.
[10:44.960 --> 10:46.640]  They just read it off the teleprompter.
[10:46.640 --> 10:49.880]  But instead, these people would look at, when they would look at this teleprompter, they
[10:49.880 --> 10:52.480]  would see Errol Morris' face.
[10:52.480 --> 10:54.600]  And they would have a conversation with this box.
[10:54.600 --> 10:59.960]  And it was interesting because it kind of put it off at another level of indirection.
[10:59.960 --> 11:05.680]  Kind of the same way that when Alex went into Google and put a real camera in front of the
[11:05.680 --> 11:11.000]  people's face and started talking to them last Thursday, recording them, putting a camera
[11:11.000 --> 11:15.560]  there, they got all flustered because he was right there with that camera in their face.
[11:15.560 --> 11:19.280]  But they were sitting in front of a laptop that has a camera, has a microphone.
[11:19.280 --> 11:20.680]  They don't think about that.
[11:20.680 --> 11:26.600]  Same way we had the video of Tom Mabe as he would dress up like a man in black government
[11:26.600 --> 11:30.120]  agent with the headphones and carrying a boom mic, and he would chase people around in public.
[11:30.120 --> 11:32.480]  He'd go up to them and put a boom mic in front of their faces.
[11:32.480 --> 11:35.360]  They're talking to other people, sitting on a bench, or they're walking down the street
[11:35.360 --> 11:40.080]  talking on the phone, and they would start to get angry, or they would try to run away
[11:40.080 --> 11:41.080]  from him.
[11:41.080 --> 11:44.520]  And yet, their phone conversations are being recorded all the time by the government, by
[11:44.520 --> 11:49.640]  the NSA, being passed on to the government by the phone company.
[11:49.640 --> 11:57.400]  So when Errol Morris would do this with his documentaries, he would use this in Tarotron.
[11:57.400 --> 12:01.440]  And they would be talking to a box instead of to a person that would relax people, interestingly
[12:01.440 --> 12:02.440]  enough.
[12:02.440 --> 12:03.440]  That's how he got the murder to confess.
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.280]  And that's how he got Robert McNamara, the former Defense Secretary during the Vietnam
[12:08.280 --> 12:09.280]  War.
[12:09.280 --> 12:11.360]  That's how he got him to confess to being a war criminal.
[12:11.360 --> 12:13.040]  Yeah, he did that.
[12:13.040 --> 12:20.400]  He got him to confess to using the Gulf of Tonkin as a false flag, interestingly enough.
[12:20.400 --> 12:23.720]  Now, that right there was huge.
[12:23.720 --> 12:27.480]  He got him to confess that they knew that the domino theory was total nonsense.
[12:27.480 --> 12:34.400]  He recalled a meeting that they had with the North Vietnamese decades after the war.
[12:34.400 --> 12:39.600]  And one of the North Vietnamese pounded the table and said, you stupid idiot, you thought
[12:39.600 --> 12:42.280]  we were going to become pawns of the Chinese.
[12:42.280 --> 12:43.480]  Don't you know anything about history?
[12:43.480 --> 12:47.480]  Don't you know that the Vietnamese have been fighting the Chinese for a thousand years
[12:47.480 --> 12:49.160]  for their independence?
[12:49.160 --> 12:51.000]  We didn't want to be slaves of the French.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.760]  We didn't want to be slaves of the Americans.
[12:52.760 --> 12:55.680]  We didn't want to be slaves of the Chinese either.
[12:55.680 --> 12:57.920]  And of course, we've seen that now in subsequent years.
[12:57.920 --> 13:02.620]  We've seen that there's been a back and forth of the Chinese trying to encroach upon Vietnam.
[13:02.620 --> 13:04.440]  And we've seen them pushing back.
[13:04.440 --> 13:05.440]  So he admitted that.
[13:05.440 --> 13:10.840]  He admitted that they knew that the Gulf of Tonkin, quote unquote, attack was total nonsense.
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.160]  And they used it as justification to escalate the war.
[13:14.160 --> 13:15.400]  But he tried to deflect things.
[13:15.400 --> 13:18.880]  He didn't want to say that he was a war criminal because of Vietnam.
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.320]  What he wanted to say was, well, he was at the end of his life.
[13:23.320 --> 13:25.840]  He died shortly after this documentary was done.
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.120]  And so he wanted to confess to being a war criminal, but not in a way that could really
[13:29.120 --> 13:30.120]  get him in trouble.
[13:30.120 --> 13:34.880]  So what he said was, the bombing campaigns that they conducted during World War II against
[13:34.880 --> 13:40.280]  Japan, the firebombing campaigns, he said, they cause massive destruction that was far
[13:40.280 --> 13:42.920]  worse than the nuclear weapons that were dropped.
[13:42.920 --> 13:44.080]  Then he said it was unwarranted.
[13:44.080 --> 13:50.760]  And he said, if we had lost the war, we would have been tried as war criminals.
[13:50.760 --> 13:56.280]  So he would confess to being over the top with World War II because World War II was
[13:56.280 --> 13:58.280]  recognized by everyone as being a just war.
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.080]  We were attacked by the Japanese, we were responded.
[14:01.080 --> 14:06.640]  But when he would not confess to being a war criminal when it came to Vietnam because they
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.440]  had initiated that war and they had created that war with a false flag attack.
[14:11.440 --> 14:12.440]  So watch that film.
[14:12.440 --> 14:13.440]  Watch Fog of War.
[14:13.440 --> 14:16.760]  It's a very well done documentary, it'll really enlighten you to it.
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.160]  But I thought about that again yesterday as I saw this Blair acknowledgement of ISIS being
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.960]  created by their blowback by their bad policy.
[14:25.960 --> 14:27.720]  I was watching another documentary.
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.880]  It was a screening by a local filmmaker.
[14:32.880 --> 14:34.160]  I was invited to see it.
[14:34.160 --> 14:35.480]  It's called Killing Ed.
[14:35.480 --> 14:40.720]  It's about charter schools, the back and forth between charter schools and public schools.
[14:40.720 --> 14:45.040]  One of the things that I think is very interesting about this is they use the worst case example
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.560]  of what can go wrong with charter schools, which is the Gulen organization, started by
[14:50.560 --> 14:52.320]  Fatala Gulen.
[14:52.320 --> 14:58.600]  Now Fatala Gulen was someone who was a radical imam in Turkey.
[14:58.600 --> 15:01.640]  So radical in fact, that he had to flee the country.
[15:01.640 --> 15:07.560]  What he was saying in Turkey was he wanted to establish a transnational Islamic state,
[15:07.560 --> 15:08.560]  a caliphate.
[15:08.560 --> 15:10.240]  Does that sound familiar?
[15:10.240 --> 15:13.680]  Of course, this was prior to 1999.
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.680]  He fled in 1999, 16 years ago.
[15:16.680 --> 15:22.640]  Well before, ISIS appeared on the scene a couple of years ago when they started calling
[15:22.640 --> 15:25.920]  him ISIS because we all know what ISIS is.
[15:25.920 --> 15:31.040]  We have seen the American government, we've seen the CIA create the Mujahideen and use
[15:31.040 --> 15:32.040]  them against Russia.
[15:32.040 --> 15:37.000]  They became al-Qaeda, then al-Qaeda goes into Syria to be used as our surrogates.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.120]  They call them al-Nusrat first and they call them ISIS and this is something that's been
[15:42.120 --> 15:45.680]  going on a long time and he had to come up with a new narrative and we're going to tell
[15:45.680 --> 15:47.400]  you how this worked out when we come back.
[15:47.400 --> 15:57.440]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[15:57.440 --> 16:01.360]  B-12, InfoWarsLives, Vitamin B-12 formulation.
[16:01.360 --> 16:06.680]  Most forms of vitamin B-12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed
[16:06.680 --> 16:07.680]  by the body.
[16:07.680 --> 16:12.360]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B-12 injections, which

[19:57.920 --> 20:23.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:23.400 --> 20:28.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, your host.
[20:28.360 --> 20:33.120]  We were talking in the last segment about Tony Blair apologizing that he had received
[20:33.120 --> 20:39.840]  bad intelligence and saying that because somebody else had made mistakes, I mean, this is not
[20:39.840 --> 20:44.960]  even mistakes are made type of vague apologies, he's not even acknowledging responsibility
[20:44.960 --> 20:45.960]  for bad intelligence.
[20:45.960 --> 20:50.760]  He said, I received it, I'm sorry I received it, but hey, you know, wars happen.
[20:50.760 --> 20:57.440]  So after all this happened, and after we see now that ISIS has been the logical conclusion
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.960]  many people are saying, the blowback, that's what he's trying to put out there for you.
[21:00.960 --> 21:04.960]  What I'm trying to get you to understand is that this is not blowback.
[21:04.960 --> 21:10.120]  This is not only a phony apology, it is a phony explanation for ISIS.
[21:10.120 --> 21:15.560]  You have to understand, as we've pointed out so many times here on infowars, they have
[21:15.560 --> 21:21.720]  been using Islamic jihadists as surrogate fighters for a very long time against Russia.
[21:21.720 --> 21:25.080]  And of course, Vladimir Putin just said that.
[21:25.080 --> 21:31.800]  He said, there are no moderate terrorists in spite of what we've been told by John McCain
[21:31.800 --> 21:36.040]  as he meets with Al-Nusra, which then becomes Al-Qaeda.
[21:36.040 --> 21:40.080]  They've seen the fact that we use the Mujahideen in Afghanistan against the Russians, then
[21:40.080 --> 21:42.000]  they became Al-Qaeda.
[21:42.000 --> 21:46.920]  They've seen the fact that we used Chechen terrorists against Russia internally, then
[21:46.920 --> 21:50.200]  they brought these same Chechen terrorists into Syria.
[21:50.200 --> 21:53.160]  They became Al-Nusra and ISIS.
[21:53.160 --> 21:54.600]  This is very obvious to everybody.
[21:54.600 --> 21:58.800]  We've had even congressmen when they were trying to get the Syrian war started in a year
[21:58.800 --> 22:02.600]  and a half ago, congressmen were saying, and it became a meme.
[22:02.600 --> 22:04.640]  We helped to publicize that.
[22:04.640 --> 22:10.880]  Do not use our military forces as an air force for Al-Qaeda.
[22:10.880 --> 22:15.040]  We knew that these quote, unquote, Syrian rebels and moderate rebels so forth, they were
[22:15.040 --> 22:16.680]  all Al-Qaeda.
[22:16.680 --> 22:20.840]  They were the Jihadist terrorists, whatever name you want to call them, ISIS, ISIL, doesn't
[22:20.840 --> 22:21.840]  matter.
[22:21.840 --> 22:23.680]  They're all the same.
[22:23.680 --> 22:25.360]  And we knew that it was rigged up.
[22:25.360 --> 22:29.280]  We had multiple congressmen saying, we had Dennis Kucinich, retired congressman saying
[22:29.280 --> 22:34.720]  it, Rand Paul, I think Ted Cruz said it, it's air force for Al-Qaeda.
[22:34.720 --> 22:39.520]  And of course, they're being used as surrogates, but this is not something that happened because
[22:39.520 --> 22:41.720]  of bad foreign policy.
[22:41.720 --> 22:43.220]  This is by design.
[22:43.220 --> 22:45.240]  It's by design by the CIA.
[22:45.240 --> 22:49.680]  The CIA created these organizations, they equip these organizations, they train them,
[22:49.680 --> 22:53.960]  and they continue to equip them and support them and not fight them.
[22:53.960 --> 22:57.360]  And that's what we're seeing now that Putin is going into the area.
[22:57.360 --> 23:02.200]  We have this article up on Infowars.com, Baghdad allows Russia to bomb ISIL terrorists who are
[23:02.200 --> 23:04.280]  running from Syria into Iraq.
[23:04.280 --> 23:06.320]  They say, come on, get rid of them.
[23:06.320 --> 23:12.400]  We're tired of them being given equipment and allowed to operate here with impunity
[23:12.400 --> 23:14.120]  because the Americans can see them there.
[23:14.120 --> 23:20.600]  But they want to use them as leverage against not only Russia, but against us internally.
[23:20.600 --> 23:26.000]  Understand that when the USSR collapsed, they lost their justification for the big ticket
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.960]  items that they had been using the military industrial complex for the Cold War.
[23:29.960 --> 23:35.040]  How do you justify these transcontinental ballistic missiles, the multiple warheads,
[23:35.040 --> 23:40.080]  the massive bombers, and the big naval group carriers?
[23:40.080 --> 23:42.680]  You can't justify that against terrorists.
[23:42.680 --> 23:44.800]  So they had to start the Cold War back up.
[23:44.800 --> 23:50.000]  And what better way to do it than to use the same group of terrorists that they had used
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.440]  to essentially defeat the USSR in Afghanistan.
[23:53.440 --> 23:58.400]  The same group of terrorists that they had created in order to start the never-ending
[23:58.400 --> 24:03.520]  war on terror to justify the buildup, the military buildup within our country, within
[24:03.520 --> 24:04.520]  America.
[24:04.520 --> 24:09.800]  This is the characterization of the police and using the military as police in our country.
[24:09.800 --> 24:15.200]  And a good example of this, as I started to talk about yesterday, was the, as I started
[24:15.200 --> 24:20.480]  talking about in the last break, was the film that I saw yesterday that was going through
[24:20.480 --> 24:25.600]  the history of one of the largest charter school groups in the country.
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.880]  And it's being run by a guy who is here on exile out of Turkey, Fatala Gulen.
[24:30.880 --> 24:35.760]  He had to flee Turkey 16 years ago because he was trying to create ISIS 16 years ago
[24:35.760 --> 24:36.760]  in Turkey.
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.560]  A transnational Islamic caliphate, and he was thrown out of Turkey, had to flee.
[24:42.560 --> 24:43.560]  Where did he go?
[24:43.560 --> 24:48.600]  He went to America, and he got into America because the CIA gave him special letters.
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.600]  There were many people in the government that didn't want him to come into the country
[24:52.600 --> 24:54.480]  that opposed that.
[24:54.480 --> 24:57.440]  But they were overruled by these letters by the CIA.
[24:57.440 --> 24:59.200]  And so what has he done?
[24:59.200 --> 25:06.600]  In the last 16 years, he has been setting up Islamic schools for his brand of Islam throughout
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.680]  the world, and especially in the United States, and not only that, but we are subsidizing
[25:11.680 --> 25:12.680]  that.
[25:12.680 --> 25:17.360]  And he talks about how he's creating the golden generation, talking about how they're going
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.760]  to set up a spider net, a spider web, to collect people in this spider web.
[25:22.760 --> 25:24.720]  They're going to buy their time, just like a spider.
[25:24.720 --> 25:25.960]  They're creating this web.
[25:25.960 --> 25:30.040]  They're creating the next generation of fighters in these schools, and they're just going to
[25:30.040 --> 25:31.680]  wait for this to happen.
[25:31.680 --> 25:36.280]  And he's supported in all this by the CIA, the same people that created al-Qaeda, the
[25:36.280 --> 25:44.080]  same people that created ISIS, the way you can change society, the way you can control
[25:44.080 --> 25:47.120]  societal change, of course, is through schools, through education.
[25:47.120 --> 25:52.400]  And I don't want my schools being controlled by somebody like Bill Ayers, but that's where
[25:52.400 --> 25:53.840]  he went to hang out.
[25:53.840 --> 26:00.160]  See, the educational establishment, the other side of this, of course, we can have organizations
[26:00.160 --> 26:04.240]  like the Ghoulin schools get massive funding from the government through the charter school
[26:04.240 --> 26:05.240]  program.
[26:05.240 --> 26:09.640]  But on the other side, you have the socialists like Bill Ayers who insinuate themselves into
[26:09.640 --> 26:15.400]  the government education system with the intention of remaking our society.
[26:15.400 --> 26:19.360]  And that's been the purpose of the government schools for quite some time.
[26:19.360 --> 26:23.800]  They didn't really start to realize that purpose until they consolidated control to the national
[26:23.800 --> 26:24.800]  level.
[26:24.800 --> 26:26.960]  And now things are starting to change very rapidly.
[26:26.960 --> 26:28.860]  We can all see what's happening.
[26:28.860 --> 26:31.320]  And the question is, are we going to be able to control that?
[26:31.320 --> 26:34.800]  But that's the way you change society.
[26:34.800 --> 26:38.480]  Every dictator has known that you grab the children when they're young, going all the
[26:38.480 --> 26:39.800]  way back to Plato's society.
[26:39.800 --> 26:43.000]  He said, we got to take the children away from their parents.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.640]  We don't want to have families.
[26:45.640 --> 26:50.080]  Not only do they not want to have strong families in Plato's Republic, they wanted to make sure
[26:50.080 --> 26:53.320]  no one even knew who their mother and father were.
[26:53.320 --> 26:58.400]  And so that's been the goal of people who want to have an authoritarian society throughout
[26:58.400 --> 26:59.720]  history.
[26:59.720 --> 27:00.720]  And you've heard the quotes.
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.960]  Get me a child when he's three.
[27:02.960 --> 27:06.720]  Let me have him for a few years and he's mine for life, or the biblical version of it.
[27:06.720 --> 27:10.560]  Train up a child in the way he should go and he will not depart from it when he is old.
[27:10.560 --> 27:11.560]  So there's your choice.
[27:11.560 --> 27:14.240]  You want to change the future?
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.160]  You do it with your children.
[27:16.160 --> 27:20.080]  And you either turn your children over to some social engineer, whether they're an Islamic
[27:20.080 --> 27:25.840]  fundamentalist or whether they're a socialist like Bill Eyre, or you do it yourself.
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.560]  And you instill the values in them that you want to instill in them.
[27:29.560 --> 27:31.200]  That's the future.
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.880]  The future is in your hands to educate your children, but that's where the people who
[27:35.880 --> 27:40.080]  want to engineer, who want to overthrow society, and I think it's very troubling to see that
[27:40.080 --> 27:45.800]  we have all these Islamic schools done by one of the first persons to talk about the Islamic
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.960]  state, to talk about a transnational caliphate being brought here to the United States and
[27:50.960 --> 27:56.240]  being used to train children in the United States.
[27:56.240 --> 28:00.400]  And bring over a lot of people to do that from Turkey, by the way.
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.920]  Now there's another article that we have today on Infowars.com, again about Syria.
[28:04.920 --> 28:08.440]  Russian airstrikes hit nine hospitals in Syria.
[28:08.440 --> 28:15.800]  I've talked many, many times about the repeated airstrikes by the Obama administration in
[28:15.800 --> 28:16.800]  Afghanistan.
[28:16.800 --> 28:20.760]  They attacked a doctors without borders hospital for over a half hour.
[28:20.760 --> 28:23.440]  Hospital that they knew was a hospital prior to that.
[28:23.440 --> 28:27.720]  They were called as the attack was going, that continued on for a half hour.
[28:27.720 --> 28:29.600]  It was a horrendous atrocity.
[28:29.600 --> 28:31.120]  They have not apologized for it.
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.800]  They tried to cover up the investigation.
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.760]  But now we see that it is something that is now, evidently, the rule of war by everyone.
[28:37.760 --> 28:41.640]  Now we have the Russians doing it to nine hospitals in Syria.
[28:41.640 --> 28:44.880]  That is the kind of brutality we have and it makes it all the more important that we
[28:44.880 --> 28:46.680]  stop these wars.
[28:46.680 --> 28:47.680]  Stay with us.
[28:47.680 --> 28:48.680]  We're going to be right back.
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.680]  We're going to talk about the BLM.
[28:49.680 --> 28:50.680]  We're going to war with Americans.
[28:50.680 --> 28:51.680]  We'll be right back.
[28:51.680 --> 29:19.480]  We're going to be right back.
[29:19.480 --> 29:45.880]  We're going to be right back.
[29:45.880 --> 30:11.800]  We're going to be right back.
[30:11.800 --> 30:38.200]  We're going to be right back.
[30:38.200 --> 31:08.120]  We're going to be right back.
[31:08.120 --> 31:36.040]  We're going to be right back.
[31:36.040 --> 31:39.000]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.200]  I'm staring at the computer all day working doing good.
[31:41.200 --> 31:42.520]  You're still damaging your brain.
[31:42.520 --> 31:44.720]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[31:44.720 --> 31:45.720]  It doesn't have stimulus.
[31:45.720 --> 31:46.880]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[31:46.880 --> 31:48.880]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[16:34.780 --> 33:38.680]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[33:38.680 --> 33:39.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[33:39.840 --> 33:44.600]  I'm David Knight your host on this Sunday, October 25, 2015 we're going to talk about
[33:44.600 --> 33:49.360]  this situation with the BLM illegally selling thousands of wild horses and of course we've
[33:49.360 --> 33:54.800]  had Vigo Mortensen the star of many movies but one of them that you may know of course
[33:54.800 --> 34:00.000]  is Lord of the Rings trilogy, many, many other movies though but he was on talking to Alex
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  Jones about a documentary that he had done about this very thing, about the illegal
[34:05.000 --> 34:11.520]  slaughter of wild horses but now it's been taken to a new level and I would say not just
[34:11.520 --> 34:16.800]  crony capitalism but I would say it looks kind of criminal to me.
[34:16.800 --> 34:20.840]  I want to get to that story and that's the story we have up on infowars.com today.
[34:20.840 --> 34:23.720]  First real quickly we have ancient defense back for a limited time.
[34:23.720 --> 34:27.080]  We have 15% off of ancient defense.

[34:58.840 --> 35:06.200]  Now in this story about the BLM illegally slaughtering horses, one of the things that I think
[35:06.200 --> 35:11.040]  is interesting about this, this is something that potentially may get the public upset,
[35:11.040 --> 35:13.480]  may get them angry when they see horses being slaughtered.
[35:13.480 --> 35:19.680]  You can't get them upset when they throw ranchers off of their land in Nevada so they can seize
[35:19.680 --> 35:24.440]  the land and turn it over to some large corporations for crony capitalist purposes.
[35:24.440 --> 35:30.680]  You can't get them upset when they throw miners off the land and take away their mining rights
[35:30.680 --> 35:34.600]  that they've had for nearly as long as this has been a country.
[35:34.600 --> 35:37.080]  No, you can't get them upset about that.
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.560]  They say, well, these ranchers, they're just rich people and it's like, no, they're not
[35:41.560 --> 35:42.560]  rich.
[35:42.560 --> 35:46.640]  And even though they had a large fine put against the Bundy family, they were not rich.
[35:46.640 --> 35:50.680]  You don't get rich because you have large fines, folks, okay?
[35:50.680 --> 35:56.200]  You also have the BLM throwing the miners out because they said, well, there's going
[35:56.200 --> 36:02.280]  to be a little bit of soil runoff into the water and then they have this massive destruction
[36:02.280 --> 36:08.800]  of a gold mine done by the EPA, which the Navajo Indians are asking for help now and
[36:08.800 --> 36:11.000]  the federal government says, no, we're not going to help you at all.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.160]  We're not going to give you any FEMA help.
[36:13.160 --> 36:14.880]  We're not going to do anything to clean this up.
[36:14.880 --> 36:20.360]  The massive spill that the EPA created, that they were warned would happen by people who
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.240]  were there and we were told by the retired engineer who wrote the op-ed piece.
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.560]  He says, not only are they going to blow this thing up and create an environmental catastrophe,
[36:28.560 --> 36:32.200]  but they're going to use it as justification to make the agency bigger.
[36:32.200 --> 36:35.040]  All of these things are happening, very, very predictable.
[36:35.040 --> 36:39.160]  So does the American public get angry when they do this kind of stuff to ranchers, to
[36:39.160 --> 36:40.360]  miners, to farmers?
[36:40.360 --> 36:45.800]  We had the Texas farmer and rancher that we just ran the story about two weeks ago.
[36:45.800 --> 36:48.880]  BLM is trying to take his half of his land.
[36:48.880 --> 36:53.080]  They're going through Texas, the Red River area, they're moving the boundaries around
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.080]  and they're going to take a massive amount of land if they're not stopped.
[36:57.080 --> 37:01.600]  The Texas governor, Governor Abbott, has put together a task force to push back against
[37:01.600 --> 37:05.280]  this theft by the BLM.
[37:05.280 --> 37:09.080]  So hopefully that won't happen, but they're going to take not only that rancher's land,
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.600]  but they will take his house if they are successful in moving those boundaries.
[37:12.600 --> 37:19.600]  And there's many, many other ranchers in that area that are also in that kind of situation.
[37:19.600 --> 37:21.480]  But now we've got a situation with horses.
[37:21.480 --> 37:25.000]  Horses that were slaughtered, horses are wonderful animals.
[37:25.000 --> 37:26.400]  People can get upset about this.
[37:26.400 --> 37:31.640]  Maybe they will care more about that than they do when the government throws cowboys
[37:31.640 --> 37:35.920]  and Indians off of their land, when they take their property, when they take their property
[37:35.920 --> 37:39.680]  rights, when they destroy their livelihood, when they destroy their lives.
[37:39.680 --> 37:43.240]  They've done everything short of killing them, and of course they came pretty close to killing
[37:43.240 --> 37:45.560]  us when we were out there at the Bundy Ranch.
[37:45.560 --> 37:47.200]  But they have killed a lot of horses.
[37:47.200 --> 37:50.360]  Now listen to this, here's what happened.
[37:50.360 --> 37:54.040]  They sold these 2,000 horses to a rancher.
[37:54.040 --> 38:02.560]  They paid $140,000 to deliver these 2,000 horses to a rancher named Mr. Davis.
[38:02.560 --> 38:06.920]  He paid only $10 apiece, $10 apiece.
[38:06.920 --> 38:15.680]  So he paid $20,000 for these horses, and they paid $140,000 just to transport them to him.
[38:15.680 --> 38:17.440]  You see a problem with that?
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.640]  If you're a taxpayer, even if you don't care about horses, do you see a problem with that?
[38:21.640 --> 38:29.400]  And then he turned around and made a profit of $154,000 by slaughtering them immediately.
[38:29.400 --> 38:33.000]  And that was against the law to slaughter the horses.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.400]  Now the BLM employees never attempted to verify the information that Mr. Davis provided regarding
[38:37.400 --> 38:42.400]  his intentions for the horses that he bought, despite the unusually large number of horses
[38:42.400 --> 38:43.800]  that he was buying.
[38:43.800 --> 38:49.240]  The agency also did not stop selling the horses to Mr. Davis after receiving reports
[38:49.240 --> 38:51.800]  that he was sending them to slaughter.
[38:51.800 --> 38:57.640]  So not only did they not do due diligence, but when they were warned that he was illegally
[38:57.640 --> 39:00.360]  slaughtering these horses, they continued with the program.
[39:00.360 --> 39:05.800]  And they continued with it, giving him this massive windfall, okay?
[39:05.800 --> 39:13.720]  He made $154,000 profit, spending $20,000, and they spent $140,000 just to transport
[39:13.720 --> 39:15.200]  the horses to him.
[39:15.200 --> 39:18.040]  Now you would think there'd be an investigation, wouldn't you?
[39:18.040 --> 39:23.320]  No, the Office of Inspector General declined to investigate Mr. Davis.
[39:23.320 --> 39:28.440]  They declined to investigate his ties to Mr. Salazar, the head of the Department of the
[39:28.440 --> 39:32.040]  Interior, which is over the BLM.
[39:32.040 --> 39:35.080]  The investigation was then referred to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of
[39:35.080 --> 39:36.080]  Colorado.
[39:36.080 --> 39:37.880]  He said, no, I'm not interested.
[39:37.880 --> 39:40.000]  These are powerful people.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.120]  Then it was turned over to the State of Colorado County District Attorney's Office.
[39:44.120 --> 39:49.560]  They also declined any civil or criminal prosecution because you know in this country, if you're
[39:49.560 --> 39:52.480]  rich and powerful, you can get away with anything.
[39:52.480 --> 39:54.240]  It doesn't matter.
[39:54.240 --> 39:57.160]  Nobody's going to take a look at what you're doing.
[39:57.160 --> 39:58.160]  Nothing will stop them.
[39:58.160 --> 40:00.920]  And again, let's take a look at this report that just came out.
[40:00.920 --> 40:06.760]  FEMA will not help the Navajo Nation with the Gold King Mine Spill Cleanup.
[40:06.760 --> 40:12.360]  FEMA says they have rejected a plea from the Navajo Nation for assistance in dealing with
[40:12.360 --> 40:19.720]  the fallout from the August 5 Gold Mines Spill that sent more than 3 million gallons of toxic
[40:19.720 --> 40:23.280]  waste water downstream into critical Navajo waterways.
[40:23.280 --> 40:27.040]  Now, of course, they've said that the EPA is to blame.
[40:27.040 --> 40:30.760]  They've accepted fault for that, just like in the kind of the indirect way that Tony
[40:30.760 --> 40:33.200]  Blair said, yeah, yeah, we were at fault for the Iraq war.
[40:33.200 --> 40:34.200]  So what?
[40:34.200 --> 40:35.200]  So what?
[40:35.200 --> 40:36.200]  Doesn't matter.
[40:36.200 --> 40:38.520]  So they create this explosion.
[40:38.520 --> 40:40.640]  They're warned this is going to happen.
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.760]  And this toxic waste is going to be very difficult to get rid of.
[40:44.760 --> 40:45.760]  But they're not going to help.
[40:45.760 --> 40:47.640]  The EPA is not going to help.
[40:47.640 --> 40:48.640]  They created it.
[40:48.640 --> 40:51.480]  They're supposed to protect the environment, weren't they?
[40:51.480 --> 40:54.400]  They're not only not going to protect the environment, but they're not going to clean
[40:54.400 --> 40:55.560]  up their own pollution.
[40:55.560 --> 41:00.760]  You see, the pollution is worse wherever the government controls all the land.
[41:00.760 --> 41:02.120]  We've seen this for a very long time.
[41:02.120 --> 41:05.440]  Look at the pollution in China, for example, communist China especially.
[41:05.440 --> 41:09.480]  But even now, that just a few people control everything in China.
[41:09.480 --> 41:17.880]  The real answer to pollution is not to create public lands, not to create massive government
[41:17.880 --> 41:18.880]  projects.
[41:18.880 --> 41:21.120]  It's to have private property.
[41:21.120 --> 41:25.000]  The Navajos don't want the water dirty.
[41:25.000 --> 41:30.000]  Individuals who have private property are going to take better care of it than the government
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  is.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.480]  The government uses this to increase the size of their department.
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.400]  The Interior Department probe of this spill concludes that the spill that fouled rivers
[41:39.400 --> 41:44.440]  in three states could have been avoided had the EPA team checked on water levels before
[41:44.440 --> 41:46.240]  digging into the mine.
[41:46.240 --> 41:49.480]  And the Colorado Attorney General says, and answers the questions, we've been asking the
[41:49.480 --> 41:50.480]  EPA.
[41:50.480 --> 41:55.400]  And the current owner of the Gold King mine feels that the EPA needs to better involve
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.520]  the private sector, including other area mine owners, instead of taking on the cleanup
[41:59.520 --> 42:00.520]  itself.
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.120]  See, they don't trust the EPA to clean up their own mess.
[42:03.120 --> 42:04.120]  And I don't blame them.
[42:04.120 --> 42:05.880]  I wouldn't trust them either.
[42:05.880 --> 42:07.400]  It's absolute insanity.
[42:07.400 --> 42:08.400]  But we see this.
[42:08.400 --> 42:12.640]  He says, the takeaway is the huge government action is not the answer.
[42:12.640 --> 42:17.880]  You cannot keep the government accountable, whether it is fouling the water or destroying
[42:17.880 --> 42:22.080]  the wild horses that they were tasked to protect or the water that they were tasked to protect.
[42:22.080 --> 42:25.760]  They destroy the very things that they're tasked to protect.
[42:25.760 --> 42:30.320]  Because the only thing that matters to these government bureaucracies is making the government
[42:30.320 --> 42:33.800]  bureaucracies even larger than they were to start with.
[42:33.800 --> 42:39.720]  When we come back, we're going to take a look at Hillary Clinton and what happened at the
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.520]  Benghazi hearing, was the most interesting thing, the fact that she portrayed herself
[42:43.520 --> 42:44.520]  as a victim?
[42:44.520 --> 42:46.680]  Or was it maybe what we learned about her health?
[42:46.680 --> 42:57.280]  We'll be right back.
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.840]  After the release of numerous videos showing questionable Planned Parenthood practices,
[43:01.840 --> 43:04.040]  multiple facilities have been raided.
[43:04.040 --> 43:09.200]  Reuters reports, Texas officials raided several Planned Parenthood facilities on Thursday,
[43:09.200 --> 43:13.240]  in a move that comes days after the state's Republican leaders barred the women's health
[43:13.240 --> 43:15.760]  group from receiving state Medicaid money.
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.080]  The inspector general's office declined to comment, but its agents were seen on local
[43:20.080 --> 43:24.440]  news reports entering a Planned Parenthood facility in San Antonio.
[43:24.440 --> 43:28.440]  Texas said it would launch a probe of Planned Parenthood after the release of videos in
[43:28.440 --> 43:33.840]  July by an anti-abortion activist group, Center for Medical Progress, in which a Planned Parenthood
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.520]  official is seen talking about transactions involving fetal tissue.
[43:38.520 --> 43:43.320]  And speaking on a personal note, Planned Parenthood continues to say that the videos were edited,
[43:43.320 --> 43:48.360]  which they were much like you would edit a state of a union address down to a few soundbites,
[43:48.360 --> 43:51.280]  but that doesn't mean that they were taken out of context.
[43:51.280 --> 44:19.360]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[44:34.760 --> 44:39.800]  or maximum potency, they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just
[44:39.800 --> 44:43.640]  cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that
[44:43.640 --> 44:48.120]  gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source, so it's pretty exciting and

[45:57.880 --> 46:02.040]  Many of the products at infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[46:02.040 --> 46:06.040]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[46:06.040 --> 46:10.800]  But when we look at a product like survival shield nasoniodine x2, it's something that
[46:10.800 --> 46:13.760]  really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years.
[46:13.760 --> 46:18.400]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of
[46:18.400 --> 46:23.200]  it be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in
[46:23.200 --> 46:24.320]  iodine was causing.
[46:24.320 --> 46:28.040]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves.
[46:28.040 --> 46:29.120]  What do you have to lose?
[46:29.120 --> 46:32.920]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.560]  product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[46:37.560 --> 46:40.840]  And the final reason to try x2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[46:40.840 --> 46:45.040]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[46:45.040 --> 46:47.280]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.920]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on survival shield x2 today
[46:51.920 --> 47:01.800]  at infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[47:01.800 --> 47:12.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:12.000 --> 47:18.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[47:18.560 --> 47:26.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on the Sunday, October 25th, 2015, I'm David Knight,
[47:26.440 --> 47:27.440]  your host.
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.640]  We're going to take a look at the Benghazi hearings with Hillary Clinton.
[47:31.640 --> 47:37.000]  As Maureen Dowd said in the New York Times, nobody plays the victim like Hillary.
[47:37.000 --> 47:41.600]  She can wield that label like a wrecking ball and certainly she did.
[47:41.600 --> 47:47.560]  It looks like it was a master performance for Hillary Clinton as she lied, but there
[47:47.560 --> 47:52.120]  was one aspect of it that Matt Drudge picked up on that I think is very key.
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.520]  We mentioned it briefly on Friday, but I want to play this again for you along with what
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.840]  happened in the subsequent to Matt Drudge pointing that out, Washington Post pushed
[48:01.840 --> 48:05.200]  back on it and Drudge pushed back on what the Washington Post said.
[48:05.200 --> 48:08.600]  Before we go to that first, I want to let you know that we now have 10% off of info
[48:08.600 --> 48:12.000]  wars select foods and free shipping.
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.920]  This savings could amount to $300 on a one-year food supply because free shipping on this
[48:17.920 --> 48:22.120]  food is a huge savings in addition to the 10% off.
[48:22.120 --> 48:25.600]  This is USA ingredients packaged exclusively in the USA.
[48:25.600 --> 48:30.000]  Starting from the tote to the packaging to the food, everything is made in the US.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.860]  It's all packaged in Ziploc bags, so nothing goes to waste.
[48:33.860 --> 48:36.560]  You can reseal it after it is opened.
[48:36.560 --> 48:38.920]  Very high quality packaging, very high quality food.
[48:38.920 --> 48:41.760]  Here's a couple of reviews from our site.
[48:41.760 --> 48:45.840]  Great value, what you get for the price and perfect storage container to take up the
[48:45.840 --> 48:47.720]  least amount of space.
[48:47.720 --> 48:49.120]  Great dishes for the whole family.
[48:49.120 --> 48:51.920]  That was from Sky Lookup at East Bay, California.
[48:51.920 --> 48:55.840]  That riot in LA, California says I've already eaten three of the food items in the product.
[48:55.840 --> 48:57.000]  They're really good.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.920]  Maybe ordering the three-month selection now.
[48:59.920 --> 49:06.600]  Again, you can get 10% off of info wars select foods at infowarselect.com and free shipping
[49:06.600 --> 49:10.720]  on any of the food that you buy there right now.
[49:10.720 --> 49:15.960]  As we looked at the Benghazi performance by Hillary Clinton, one of the things that stood
[49:15.960 --> 49:22.280]  out was, and it's interesting that the title of Maureen Dowd's story talking about how
[49:22.280 --> 49:27.160]  she played the victim, it's called The Empire Strikes Back, and Hillary sounded at one point
[49:27.160 --> 49:30.960]  like she needed respirator as badly as Darth Vader.
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.960]  She got on a coughing spree that lasted for a couple of minutes.
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.800]  Drudge said I think that's maybe the most important revelation was perhaps her health.
[49:40.800 --> 49:45.200]  At which point, then subsequent to that, the Washington Post on Friday declared, and this
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.280]  is Drudge putting back his commentary.
[49:49.280 --> 49:53.320]  They pushed back on what Drudge had said, and so Drudge says, well, here's what Washington
[49:53.320 --> 49:54.960]  Post said, and here's what I say.
[49:54.960 --> 49:58.040]  So the Washington Post on Friday declared that Hillary Clinton does not suffer from
[49:58.040 --> 50:01.360]  hypothyroidism even though her own doctor says she does.
[50:01.360 --> 50:06.840]  He says symptoms of low thyroid function include fatigue, hoarseness, impaired memory, reporter
[50:06.840 --> 50:12.640]  Philip Bump consulting with his own doctor diagnosed Clinton is having normal thyroid
[50:12.640 --> 50:17.840]  function based on her Benghazi performance, but Hillary's internist revealed in August
[50:17.840 --> 50:22.280]  that the Democrat frontrunner's medical conditions include hypothyroidism.
[50:22.280 --> 50:23.280]  So there you go.
[50:23.280 --> 50:26.360]  You got the Washington Post covering up for Hillary.
[50:26.360 --> 50:29.880]  Let's play a little bit of that clip and let you see what we're talking about here.
[50:29.880 --> 50:41.480]  A missile cruiser, a missile destroyer, a tanker he served in Vietnam in the Persian Gulf.
[50:41.480 --> 50:45.240]  You need some water, madam.
[50:45.240 --> 50:46.240]  Be careful with that water.
[50:46.240 --> 50:49.320]  If you spill it, she might melt.
[50:49.320 --> 50:51.920]  So this goes on for quite a while.
[50:51.920 --> 50:53.720]  Now, this is something that's hard to do on the radio.
[50:53.720 --> 50:57.640]  We didn't play this very long, but really to get the impact of this, they're going to
[50:57.640 --> 50:58.640]  continue playing this.
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.880]  So really to get the impact of this, you have to understand that this goes on for a full
[51:02.880 --> 51:05.360]  two minutes, okay?
[51:05.360 --> 51:07.200]  Goes on for a full two minutes.
[51:07.200 --> 51:11.840]  Actually, she did eventually recover and she resumed lying.
[51:11.840 --> 51:13.080]  But I want to play for you.
[51:13.080 --> 51:17.600]  When Matt Drudge was here visiting the studio, he and Alex talked about this very issue,
[51:17.600 --> 51:18.600]  about Hillary Clinton's health.
[51:18.600 --> 51:21.280]  I want to play a little clip of that right now.
[51:21.280 --> 51:29.480]  Alex, you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent
[51:29.480 --> 51:30.480]  American.
[51:30.480 --> 51:37.160]  In a big way, if your calling is media fine, if your calling is sports, whatever it is,
[51:37.160 --> 51:43.880]  but you've got to be the greatest you can be now, now, before this country is so completely
[51:43.880 --> 51:44.880]  captured.
[51:44.880 --> 51:49.800]  And we're left with Hillary's brain in the Oval Office in a jar, because that's what
[51:49.800 --> 51:50.800]  we're getting.
[51:50.800 --> 51:52.560]  She's old and she's sick.
[51:52.560 --> 51:54.160]  She's not a contender.
[51:54.160 --> 51:57.960]  They're making her a contender with these propped up Saturday Night Live things.
[51:57.960 --> 52:00.200]  It's like a head on a stick.
[52:00.200 --> 52:06.360]  And then on the Today Show with the gun three, a head on a stick, she is not a viable, vibrant
[52:06.360 --> 52:13.360]  leader for this country of 300, including the illegals, 380 million Americans.
[52:13.360 --> 52:17.040]  So the media is trying to put us to sleep.
[52:17.040 --> 52:18.040]  You're not letting them, Alex.
[52:18.040 --> 52:20.840]  Let me ask you this question, Matt.
[52:20.840 --> 52:24.440]  Is the establishment, which we know is diverse, but there's different conglomerates, is it
[52:24.440 --> 52:25.680]  panicking?
[52:25.680 --> 52:29.320]  Is it trying to push everything through right now because it knows people are waking up?
[52:29.320 --> 52:33.200]  Or is it just completely arrogant and thinks it's invincible?
[52:33.200 --> 52:38.400]  It's trying to consolidate control, yes, and there is a sense of panic about it.
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.440]  You look at a telemundo or a univision, they're kind of panicked.
[52:42.440 --> 52:46.160]  You look at some of these interviews that are happening this election cycle where Trump
[52:46.160 --> 52:53.280]  comes along, says a few things, just a few things, and soars to the top of the list.
[52:53.280 --> 52:54.840]  That's profound.
[52:54.840 --> 52:59.280]  Imagine if we actually had a good selection of candidates who were saying a lot, and I
[52:59.280 --> 53:03.800]  know Cruz and Rand and all the rest, however, you've got to be dynamic in this atmosphere
[53:03.800 --> 53:05.920]  and it's a media country.
[53:05.920 --> 53:07.720]  You've got to be dynamic in media.
[53:07.720 --> 53:09.640]  That's the only thing that's going to work.
[53:09.640 --> 53:16.200]  So I am left with thinking there's not a lot of time to be your greatest self, especially
[53:16.200 --> 53:22.960]  online because if it continues to get consolidated to this degree, and then we're moving into
[53:22.960 --> 53:28.400]  the robots, which you're so profound on, and it's going to get really ugly, really fast.
[53:28.400 --> 53:32.440]  There's already automated news sites, Google News, Hello Anybody.
[53:32.440 --> 53:36.640]  They actually, the idiots reading that crap think there is actually a human there.
[53:36.640 --> 53:38.680]  There is no human there.
[53:38.680 --> 53:43.280]  You are being programmed to being automated, even up to your news.
[53:43.280 --> 53:45.880]  And Apple News, I don't know what that's about.
[53:45.880 --> 53:47.360]  That was also creepy.
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.320]  A same corporate glaze over everything.
[53:51.320 --> 53:52.640]  I don't see the world that way.
[53:52.640 --> 53:59.160]  I live in a world that's free, colorful, vibrant, takes chances, bold, stands up to power.
[53:59.160 --> 54:01.240]  And that's where I've made my success.
[54:01.240 --> 54:04.920]  And we're always hearing in the last six, seven years that Matt Drudge is over, Matt
[54:04.920 --> 54:08.400]  Drudge doesn't exist, but then they have to admit Matt Drudge is bigger than ever.
[54:08.400 --> 54:14.360]  So this attempt to control reality or control who talks to who by these totalitarians that
[54:14.360 --> 54:17.120]  masquerade as liberals, I don't think is working.
[54:17.120 --> 54:22.320]  And now with Boehner being forced out, I think it shows the rumblings of the Tea Party beneath
[54:22.320 --> 54:23.320]  the surface.
[54:23.320 --> 54:26.840]  So, Matt, before you leave us, and I really appreciate your time.
[54:26.840 --> 54:31.400]  Oh, and by the way, the presidential candidates, that's exactly what you're saying, the rumblings.
[54:31.400 --> 54:38.200]  Look at anybody who has any form of success in the polls is because they rumble.
[54:38.200 --> 54:40.920]  Where it's gonna end up, I don't know, I'm very pessimistic.
[54:40.920 --> 54:45.760]  I'm very pessimistic on this race because I'm just not so sure it's not gonna end up
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.600]  with the dreaded brain in the jar in the Oval Office, once known as Hillary Clinton, who
[54:51.600 --> 54:53.440]  is hypothyroid.
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.640]  Anybody who is 70 years old who's hypothyroid, you do not elect president, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:58.640 --> 55:00.400]  You don't do it.
[55:00.400 --> 55:04.520]  Now they'll say, well, it has to be who her VP is, whether it's the Castro from San Antonio
[55:04.520 --> 55:08.560]  or the other Castro from San Antonio or the other Castro from San Antonio, whoever it's
[55:08.560 --> 55:10.120]  gonna be.
[55:10.120 --> 55:18.480]  I'm just shaking now after seeing NBC giving her endless hours of airtime over the past
[55:18.480 --> 55:22.560]  72 hours that Hillary's back and she's back for real.
[55:22.560 --> 55:25.880]  Now what that means to you or me, what it means to me, I've got a long history with
[55:25.880 --> 55:26.880]  these people.
[55:26.880 --> 55:27.880]  They're ugly.
[55:27.880 --> 55:28.880]  They play dirty.
[55:28.880 --> 55:33.240]  They sued me for $30 million last time around with the approval of the president announced
[55:33.240 --> 55:37.280]  by the press secretary of the White House, a civil action.
[55:37.280 --> 55:40.880]  These people, and they didn't have the NSA then, they had echelon, they had all these
[55:40.880 --> 55:43.880]  other things you were talking about even then.
[55:43.880 --> 55:50.400]  Maybe Clinton with the NSA, good luck if you dissent, good luck if you dissent.
[55:50.400 --> 55:52.800]  Snowden, I'll switch places with you.
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.240]  You can come over here in rotten hell, cuz that's what it's gonna be.
[55:56.240 --> 56:01.120]  So I'm very concerned with the lay of the land, but the rumblings you're talking about,
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.720]  that we've seen a Trump, that we've seen a Carly, that do we see in a Sanders?
[56:05.720 --> 56:09.200]  Yeah, maybe, also old, old.
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.400]  Can the Democrats find anybody under the age of 70?
[56:12.400 --> 56:17.440]  What is this oldness in a vibrant country that needs to go forward to a new century?
[56:17.440 --> 56:23.160]  So I don't know, I'm hoping for surprises, I'm hoping for some jolts, we'll have to
[56:23.160 --> 56:24.160]  see.
[56:24.160 --> 56:28.800]  And again, that was Matt Drudge when he was here at the InfoWars Studio talking to Alex
[56:28.800 --> 56:34.160]  Jones about this very issue, saying that he knew that Hillary Clinton had health issues.
[56:34.160 --> 56:38.080]  And then we saw that two minute spell there where she could not get her breath where she
[56:38.080 --> 56:39.480]  couldn't say a single thing.
[56:39.480 --> 56:44.600]  Again, you can't play that on the radio, we can't have silence with an occasional coughing
[56:44.600 --> 56:46.600]  going on for full two minutes on the radio.
[56:46.600 --> 56:49.480]  But it is pretty amazing if you look at that story.
[56:49.480 --> 56:54.200]  When we come back, we're gonna talk about the legitimate concerns about what was going
[56:54.200 --> 56:55.200]  on in Libya.
[56:55.200 --> 56:58.960]  I mean, there's legitimate concerns about the email, that's a whole other aspect.
[56:58.960 --> 57:04.680]  The possession of classified information on her server and non-classified information
[57:04.680 --> 57:10.000]  that people have been prosecuted for, other people, but not the rich and powerful like
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Hillary Clinton.
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.680]  But we're gonna focus on what was going on in Libya and the lies that were told by Hillary
[57:14.680 --> 57:15.680]  Clinton when we come back.
[57:15.680 --> 57:44.200]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[57:46.680 --> 57:48.680]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[57:48.680 --> 57:50.200]  You can't survive without it.
[57:50.200 --> 57:51.200]  But where do you get it?

[58:48.160 --> 58:51.680]  InfoWarsLife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[58:51.680 --> 58:57.120]  We have now procured the most high-quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market,
[58:57.120 --> 59:02.120]  a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used
[59:02.120 --> 59:08.040]  by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health, sourced from top-leading manufacturers
[59:08.040 --> 59:12.280]  to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.

[59:20.920 --> 59:25.600]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and
[59:25.600 --> 59:30.360]  enhance overall health, wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts
[59:30.360 --> 59:33.880]  agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.

[59:51.760 --> 01:00:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.560]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.680]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:16.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.960]  On this segment, I would like to cover what we've been talking about, Hillary Clinton.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.480]  Let's talk about the reality of what was going on in Libya.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.800]  And of course, again, Maureen Dowd talks about how they didn't lay a hand on her.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.360]  She's excellent at playing the victim.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:37.400]  But let's understand, as she points out, that it was really Hillary that was focusing on
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400]  going after Libya.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:45.120]  She says that she urged Obama to help topple Qaddafi without learning anything from the
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.040]  Iraq invasion that she had voted for.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.320]  And since she was, as her aide Jake Sullivan put it, the public face of the U.S. effort
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.440]  in Libya, one of the Furies, along with Samantha Power and Susan Rice, who'd pushed for military
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.480]  intervention on humanitarian grounds, Hillary needed to stay on top of it.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:06.320]  She says, when you're the Valkyrie who engineers the intervention, you can't say that it's
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.000]  then beneath you to pay attention to the ludicrously negligent security for your hand-picked choice
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  of ambassador in a lawless country full of assassinations and jihadist training camps.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  Well, they're full of a lot of training camps now.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.240]  And as a matter of fact, what was really behind this, as we've learned from multiple revelations,
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.800]  multiple sources, and we're going to play the report for you from John Bowne, what was
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:38.280]  at the bottom of this was really arms trade by the CIA going on at that Benghazi ambassadorship
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280]  there.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.440]  Let's play that report from John Bowne.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.400]  74 combined years in prison.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:49.400]  That's how Iceland's Supreme Court and the Reykjavik District Court respond to those
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.920]  responsible for Iceland's financial collapse.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:59.720]  This brings the total to 26 bankers now behind bars in Iceland, with most being CEOs of large
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.280]  financial institutions rather than low-level traders.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:09.560]  Most of those jailed will serve terms of two to five years, according to a report by Iceland
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:16.000]  magazine, which notes that three executives at Lansbanken and two at Kalpin, along with
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.440]  one prominent investor, have been prosecuted.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:24.320]  Their crimes include market manipulation, embezzlement, and breach of fiduciary duties.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.120]  Their market manipulation destroyed the country's economy, and to this day, Iceland is still
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.280]  having to repay the global loan sharks at the IMF, as well as governments of other countries.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280]  Okay, let's pull that.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.920]  Actually, I wanted to run John Bowne's report on the arms trade in Benghazi.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.160]  They got John Bowne's report on the bankers in Iceland.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.880]  Let me tell you what was going on in Benghazi.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.760]  As I pointed out in this hearing here, she says this is marine doubt again.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:56.280]  She says in a rare moment of lucidity, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas said to Clinton, you
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:01.320]  described Mr. Stevens as having the best knowledge of Libya of anyone, but when he asked for
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.920]  increased security, you didn't give it to him.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:10.720]  And she says, well, you know, I didn't have his personal email or his cell phone number.
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.120]  So she doesn't have any of that stuff.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.440]  She says there's no call logs of talks between Stevens and Clinton.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.320]  She said she couldn't remember if she ever spoke to him again after she swore him in
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.840]  in May.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:28.160]  But as Marine Doubts points out, Libya was the country where she was midwife to chaos.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.360]  And again, she throws Stevens under the bus saying that he was responsible for his own
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360]  security.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.800]  She said we were really counting on Chris to guide us and to give us the information
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.960]  on the ground.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.800]  This is a story that we had up on October 22nd on Infowars.com.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.560]  In other words, he failed me.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.800]  I didn't make a mistake.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800]  He made a mistake.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.400]  But again, Rand Paul says Hillary Clinton was bugging Obama to intervene in Libya, exactly
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.680]  saying the same thing that Marine Doubts said.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.000]  He says there's another story here.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.200]  Why were we in Libya?
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.200]  Was it a good idea?
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:06.200]  Hillary Clinton was the biggest proponent, bugging Obama saying we need to topple Gaddafi.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.800]  Rand Paul goes on to say, well, if you look at Libya now, it's a failed state.
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:13.840]  There's no government, a third of those in Libya pledge allegiance to ISIS.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.120]  I contend that not only did she not provide adequate security in Benghazi, but that she
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.160]  was a proponent for a war that actually made things less stable, worse off, and made it
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.560]  more likely that we will be attacked by someone in Libya.
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.640]  But it's even more obvious than that.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:34.800]  This is a story from antiwar.com saying Hillary claims that Libya shows that the consequences
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.720]  of US military withdrawal.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.160]  In other words, all of this is happening because we left the area.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.160]  That's not true.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.800]  We're going to tell you why that's not true.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.120]  We're going to tell you what was exactly happening there when we come back.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.120]  Stay with us.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:58.120]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.840]  As any regular listener knows, I don't script what I have to say.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.440]  I do my research and then I tell it like it is and let the chips fall where they may.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.200]  And I'm going to do that right now.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:14.160]  I have never, in my 20 years on air, seen a time where it's more important to be prepared.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.840]  Even most mainline analysts are now saying, we've entered this critical juncture.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.840]  We've got to get prepared.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.600]  Everyone knows I'm obsessed with win-win situations.

[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.600]  We are on the march.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.720]  The empire is on the run.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:22.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday, October 25th, 2015.
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.800]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.280]  We've been talking about Hillary Clinton.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:35.360]  We talked about the revelations that we saw as she gassed for air for over two minutes
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:41.240]  coughing and went back to Matt Drudge talking about her hypothyroidism.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:47.000]  This is a well-known fact by her doctor going back to August, but of course Washington Post
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.040]  pushes back on that and says, no, no, no, she had a great performance, so I don't think
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.400]  she's sick at all in spite of that.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:58.640]  And we talked about what Matt Drudge pointed out that, well, actually her doctor said it.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.280]  Your doctor who hasn't examined her pointed out that he didn't think that she had a condition.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.440]  But let's talk a little bit about the Libya connection because we've talked a lot about
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.000]  the email issues, the fact that many of these things are born classified.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.080]  That's what the retired person who was in charge of classifying documents has said.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.760]  He says, if you're talking to a foreign head of state and you have private conversations
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.520]  between them, that is born classified.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.920]  But the very fact that she would set this up on an internal server, that she would put
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.280]  documents there that our State Department documents, that she would use it for official
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.400]  conversations, that in and of itself is a problem.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:40.400]  We have seen NSA whistleblowers like Thomas Drake charged and prosecuted, although the
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.040]  charges were dropped because it was a phony prosecution, it was a persecution of him.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.440]  Nevertheless, we've seen that he and others have been charged with deleting emails or
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:56.120]  having documents on their computers that are not even classified.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.400]  So the fact that she says these were not classified, that doesn't matter.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:05.400]  They charged Thomas Drake with having documents on his computer that were not classified.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.280]  She violated the law.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.940]  She deleted not just one email as the CIA whistleblower was prosecuted for doing.
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:15.560]  She deleted thousands, tens of thousands of emails.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.880]  So we've talked about that, but let's talk about what was going on in Libya.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.960]  Let's talk about the bull face lies that she told.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.680]  Here's a story from antiwar.com.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:30.080]  Bizarre revisionism, Hillary Clinton claims Libya shows the consequences of US military
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.080]  withdrawal.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:36.000]  In other words, we have this mess there because we withdrew our forces.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.640]  And Jason Ditz points out there never was a formal ground operation in Libya to begin
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.640]  with.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.280]  He says while the US illegally participated in the NATO war against Libya in 2011, they
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.960]  never actually had a ground presence in the country in the first place.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:54.840]  Security was simply at the embassy level as it is in most non-occupied countries.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.880]  Okay, while Clinton presented the situation as a power vacuum, it was fueling extremism.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.280]  It wasn't the case.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.160]  The centerpiece of the US operations he points out in the country at the time was a CIA weapons
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.720]  smuggling operation inside of Benghazi.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.800]  The reality is that when dozens of CIA agents are smuggling arms into the city, the American
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:23.160]  consulate in that city is inevitably, how's that operation necessarily becomes a high
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.560]  value target.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.440]  That is precisely what happened.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.160]  Now, again, there's a story from New American Clinton exposed as a liar in Benghazi gate
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.240]  hearings, but the secrets remain.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:41.120]  They say facing a question by Representative Mike Pompeo, Kansas, asked about whether Clinton
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.680]  knew of a gun-running scheme to Libyan rebels, Clinton said, well, I think the answer is
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.840]  no.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.360]  Then asked if she knew whether the US government or its proxies were sending weapons to Syrian
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.160]  rebels from Libya.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:58.840]  She also said, did you ever consider the idea of using private security experts to arm the
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840]  opposition?
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.280]  And she said, not seriously, no.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.800]  And they point out that the word seriously appears to be an effort to conceal the truth
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.600]  and to prevent her from being brought up on perjury charges.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:19.480]  Because right after she said that, no, not seriously, Pompeo read an email from Clinton
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.200]  to another official at the time outlining a scheme to do exactly that.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:31.720]  Quote, for your information, the idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.360]  should be considered, she said.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.040]  So there you go.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:39.240]  That's what was at the bottom of what was going on there, and of course, Rand Paul is
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:45.040]  correct to point out that it has now become an arms bizarre, has descended into total
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:49.760]  chaos because Hillary Clinton pushed Obama to get rid of Qaddafi.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.440]  Qaddafi was not a threat to anyone, had not been a threat to anyone for quite some time,
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:59.000]  but our government has had a long list and we've had the Obama administration and Hillary
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.560]  Clinton as Secretary of State has gone down this list of countries invading and continuing
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.400]  wars in at least seven different countries in the Middle East.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:15.880]  They want to have continued instability, continued chaos, because it helps their military industrial
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:22.360]  complex programs to have another Cold War that they're pushing with Russia.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.000]  Let's go on to some political news now.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  We've got Ben Carson, came out, this is a story on InfoWars.com, he says, intensify
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.720]  the drug war.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.920]  He was talking to Glenn Beck and he said, if elected, he will intensify the war on drugs.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.600]  He said he also opposes the legalization of marijuana.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.400]  When asked about those, he says, absolutely, he said he would continue the war on drugs.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:49.520]  I intend to fight, as I said before, has he been under anesthesia for the last 44 years
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.840]  to see what a failure the war on drugs has been?
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:00.000]  As we point out in our article, in 2010 alone, the federal government spent over $15 billion
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.400]  batting the use and distribution of illegal drugs while state and local governments spent
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.560]  $25 billion.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:13.060]  So look, in 2010, combined state and federal spending on the drug war was $40 billion.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.560]  Multiply that out by 44 years.
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.560]  What do you get?
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.360]  $1.7 trillion, if that was typical, a typical year.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:24.760]  Now that's an insane amount of money.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.680]  That's an insane amount of money, $1.7 trillion, and I don't know what the total figure is.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.200]  It's just a rough calculation based on what we spent in 2010.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:37.520]  But that doesn't include the cost in the lives that have been lost from the war on drugs.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.260]  It doesn't include the cost of people's lives that have been destroyed by being put in prison
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.040]  with mandatory minimums.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:49.160]  It doesn't include the cost to the public of civil asset forfeiture, where without due
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.680]  process your property is stolen.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.960]  We have lost the concept of due process.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.120]  We've lost the concept of private property because of the war on drugs.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.640]  And of course, it has been a boon to the government.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.040]  It's been a boon to the organized crime figures.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.680]  It's given them a monopoly on a very lucrative black market, just as we saw during alcohol
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.080]  prohibition.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.300]  And it brings up the point yet again that Ben Carson doesn't understand or care the
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.840]  first thing about individual liberty or the Constitution.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.640]  We don't have legal authority and the Constitution of the federal government doesn't have legal
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.120]  authority for a drug war.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.720]  Has Ben Carson, and do the conservatives who support him, do they realize that the war
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.360]  on drugs is a UN agenda?
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.120]  It was something that was created, our four schedules where they have schedule one, two,
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.120]  three, four drugs.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.920]  Marijuana is a schedule one drug saying that it has absolutely no medical use.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.600]  That's an outright lie, but that's the way they operate with the war on drugs.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.400]  That whole process was set up by the United Nations in 1961, ten years before Richard
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.680]  Nixon declared the war on drugs in 1971.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.640]  This whole thing is a UN agenda.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.880]  And conservatives are buying into a UN agenda that has destroyed private property, that
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:09.200]  has bred corruption, that has increased organized crime, that has filled our prisons at a rate
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.800]  that no country in history has ever had people in prison.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.200]  We've got more people in prison than China.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.600]  And they've got a population that I think is, if I remember the statistics, seven times
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.160]  larger than ours.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.960]  We've got more people in prison than any other country, China, Russia, North Korea.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.120]  We've got a larger number of people, a larger percentage by far than any other country.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.520]  And it's because of the war on drugs.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:39.320]  And Ben Carson wants to stomp on the rights of states to stop this madness.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.120]  That's a form of madness itself.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.400]  And this is how he justifies it.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:48.880]  He says, we're gradually just removing all the barriers to hedonistic activity.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.480]  Removing the barriers to hedonistic activity.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:58.640]  So he wants to continue this insane illegal war on drugs that hasn't accomplished anything.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.800]  Because he doesn't like hedonistic activity.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.960]  I look at this, and I look at my friends who support him, my Christian friends who support
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.960]  him.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.720]  And I say, the Christian church in America worships government, not God.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.200]  It sees more power in the fist of the police.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.640]  Sees more power in the truncheon than it does in the cross.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.760]  And it disgusts me to see people so in love with government, so completely blind to the
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:30.720]  power of Christ to change lives, that they want to use the fist of government.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.720]  And then he goes on to say, well, do the same people that argue for getting rid of the war
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.920]  on drugs, do they argue for freedom of choice when someone says they want to buy a gun?
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.840]  Of course they don't.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.360]  And that's the problem.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.120]  The left wants to take away the second amendment, and the right wants to take away the ninth
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.960]  and the tenth and the fourth and everything else.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:54.560]  We have to come together, and the war on drugs needs to stop, and so does the war on the
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.760]  right to keep them bare-armed.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.760]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.480]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.720]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.880]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:14.160]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.680]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.200]  of brain force.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.200]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.800]  Staying at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.880]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.040]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:00.960]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built up toxins, and even dangerous objects
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.360]  known as liver stones.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.360]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.080]  other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.400]  and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.400]  effect.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.480]  Livershield is the only liver support product in the market that uses a patented, spy-girex
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.080]  blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.360]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:30.360]  liver detox.

[01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.720]  I love our candy, I love our video games, why not mine?
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.480]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.440]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.080]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:18.560]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:23.080]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.600]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.600]  drugs.
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:32.520]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.560]  that children would actually like and take.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.120]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.320]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:31.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.040]  I'm David Knight, your host on this Sunday, October 25, 2015.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.440]  We're going to get back to politics.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.160]  We were just talking about what Ben Carson was saying about the drug war.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.400]  He wants to ramp up the drug war.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.680]  And we talked about the insanity of that.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.560]  We're going to go back to some of what the other candidates are saying.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:56.160]  Of course, Jeb Bush is saying some pretty incredibly stupid things are starting to collapse
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:00.400]  around him and he's starting to get a bit crazy with the things that he says.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]  We're going to cover that.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:05.160]  We're also going to take your calls if you want to call in and comment on some of the
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.040]  topics we've been talking about today or on something else.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:12.560]  The number will be 877-789-2539.
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.240]  That's 877-789-ALAX if you want to call in and comment on what we've been talking about
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240]  today.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.680]  Before I get back to the news, I just want to let you know that we have a supermael vitality
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.560]  back in stock.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.680]  It's back for a limited run.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.680]  Now is the time to get yours before we sell out again.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:32.320]  Once we sell out, it could be months before we're able to secure another shipment.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:38.480]  This ultra strength formula contains organic herbs and acids and that are the real deal.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.360]  Let me give you a couple of comments on our site here.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:50.920]  This is because we give people the capability to make comments about the different products
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:55.400]  so you can help make up your mind about what you like with this, what will work for you.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.480]  Here's one from Guide in Boise, Idaho.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:00.720]  He says, this is far superior to other products I've tried in the past.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.560]  He says, stamina and clarity, especially in the morning with no running out of gas in
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.720]  the afternoon.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.280]  It works for me and I notice a better recovery after my workouts.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:15.480]  Another review from Info Warrior in Osville, Kentucky says there's nothing bad about supermael.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.600]  The best product I've found that works, I use it daily.
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.760]  It's great to take and work out with.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.120]  Alex Jones has great products.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.080]  I've been telling all my friends about this product.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.440]  Alex Jones, you're the best.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:33.480]  Again, you can read those reviews at infowarslife.com and order supermael vitality before we sell
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.480]  out.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480]  Again, it's back in stock.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.480]  It won't last very long.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.560]  Going back to the comments that Ben Carson said, one of the last things that he had in
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:46.480]  this article we got up on infowars.com from Curt Nimo, he says, well, do those same people
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:49.640]  who argue for freedom of choice with drugs.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:55.280]  When someone says I want to buy a gun, I want to buy an Uzi, Carson said, let's be consistent
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.280]  with this thing.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.520]  I was like, yeah, let's be consistent.
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.280]  Let's follow the Constitution.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:05.320]  Let's understand that you don't have the authority to ban this stuff.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:10.880]  And if you take this, if you allow people to prohibit things that you don't have the authority
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:15.200]  to prohibit, then they're going to come after things that are even expressly protected,
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.980]  like the right to keep and bear arms.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.040]  We need to be consistent.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.120]  We need to be constitutional.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.840]  And I would like to see Ben Carson actually read the Constitution and understand it.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.120]  Again, as I've said before, the way I look at the way he's running for president is
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:32.000]  like somebody, he's a physician, he's a brain surgeon.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.560]  It would be as if he was trying to do brain surgery, never having red, gray's anatomy.
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:40.880]  The man has absolutely no appreciation of or understanding of individual liberty.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.360]  He wants to take away your informed consent when it comes to vaccinations.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.280]  He has opposed the right to keep and bear arms in the past.
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.840]  And now he thinks that he can just arbitrarily, along with the rest of the politicians in
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:54.840]  Washington, they can arbitrarily tell you what you can and cannot put in your body.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.560]  And that includes the FDA as well.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:58.240]  That includes the FDA as well.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.920]  But of course, as a doctor, he thinks that they ought to be able to dictate to you what
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.880]  medicines you are allowed to take and what you must take in the future.
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.440]  That's going to be the other side of that.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.720]  That's the vaccine side.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.640]  And Mike Huckabee talked about guns.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.800]  He said that gun stores should disobey any Obama executive orders, because we see that
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:22.800]  Obama is now increasingly talking about doing gun control by executive order.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.320]  Mike Huckabee, who's also running for president, said the more we surrender the Constitution,
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.200]  the more he will keep that going precisely.
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:34.000]  But what he needs to understand and what he needs to talk to people about, but you won't
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.720]  hear any presidential candidates talk about state nullification, because that's what
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:44.440]  the states have done with the legalization of drugs, with medical marijuana as well as
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.440]  with recreational use of marijuana.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.000]  That is state nullification.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.400]  That is the people saying, we're tired of this failed war on drugs.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.320]  It hasn't done anything but give us more dangerous forms of the drugs.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.400]  It hasn't reduced the amount of usage instead.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:02.440]  What we've gotten is a massive police state, a massive prison state, massive organized
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.960]  crime, given a monopoly in the black market.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]  And we're tired of it.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:10.400]  So we're going to nullify that federal war on drugs, which is really a UN agenda, as
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.080]  I mentioned in the last segment.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.660]  So Huckabee needs to talk about state nullification, not only for all of these issues.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.080]  We have to understand that this is about individual freedom.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.760]  It isn't about whether you like guns or whether you like drugs.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:28.560]  If we can get past that, if we can get past the idea that the left wants to have drugs
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.880]  legalized because they like them, the right wants to have guns legalized because they
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.880]  like them.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.440]  We need to understand that we don't want government dictating to us these things, and we need
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:38.440]  to come together.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.640]  And we need to allow people to have the freedom to do things that we wouldn't necessarily
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.120]  want to do if we're going to have the freedom to do what we want to do.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.120]  You understand that?
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.920]  It's all the way across the spectrum.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.200]  It's all or nothing.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.280]  You either respect individual rights and the Constitution that was written to respect
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.400]  those individual rights, or you get nothing.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.520]  You won't have your guns if you take away people's drugs because you're supporting an
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.560]  illegal operation by an illegal government without authority.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.560]  And he needs to talk about not only state nullification, but Mike Huckabee needs to
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.920]  talk about jury nullification.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.840]  Because if people in gun stores are going to say, well, I don't like Obama's laws about
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.800]  guns, then they're going to be thrown in jail just like the people who disobey the illegal
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.560]  war on drugs.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.000]  And we need to stop that.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.280]  And the way to stop that is with jury nullification if we can't get people at the state level
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280]  to do it.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:33.440]  Otherwise, the gun store owners are going to kind of be left out there on their own,
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.920]  as we have seen with people who legitimately were growing medical marijuana following state
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.240]  laws and then arrested by the federal government.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.240]  We've seen that happen.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.880]  It will happen with the gun store owners, even if those orders are illegal because having
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.520]  an illegal order doesn't mean anything in America.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.880]  They will use force of arms even if they don't have the legal authority.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.960]  Now, things are getting really tough for Jeb.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.560]  We have a story up on infowars.com today.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:05.360]  Jeb says, I could be doing really cool things instead of being presidents, instead of running
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.360]  for president.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:11.160]  They say the outburst is likely the culmination of frustration that his sagging campaign is
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.600]  going nowhere.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:18.880]  And I would say, please, please do, please go do your really cool thing and don't inflict
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:20.960]  us with another Bush presidency.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.440]  The American Mirror says Jeb Bush is now acting as though the American people should be grateful
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.680]  that he is running for president.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:30.200]  Here's the clip where he says that.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.120]  If this election is about how we're going to fight to get nothing done, then I don't
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.280]  want anything, I don't want any part of it.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.640]  I don't want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.720]  that people literally are in decline in their lives.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.720]  That is not my motivation.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.680]  I got a lot of really cool things I could do other than that.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.280]  Okay, okay, you hear that?
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:56.040]  I don't want to see gridlock happening where people are literally having a decline in their
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.040]  lives.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:02.800]  Do you understand what a statist mindset that is, that if the government doesn't keep writing
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.360]  more laws, our lives are going to literally decline?
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.440]  Nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.840]  We got to get over this mentality that's been around my entire life is there ought to be
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.840]  a law about that.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.880]  There ought to be a law about this, there ought to be a law about that other thing.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:22.000]  That's what has killed this country, and we don't need more of that.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.960]  We don't depend on the government to pass more laws in order to keep things flowing.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:30.960]  He says, we're going to be literally in decline.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:33.120]  I want gridlock.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.400]  He says he thinks that Trump is going to bring gridlock.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.100]  Well, that's the best argument I've heard yet for electing Donald Trump.
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:41.800]  We need to stop the government from creating more laws.
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.360]  We have so many laws now, nobody knows what they are.
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:48.440]  We'll be right back, we'll continue on with what Jeb Bush has to say.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:57.640]  You won't believe what else he had to say, we'll be right back.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:03.240]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:09.760]  Stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.800]  warrants.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:17.120]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:23.760]  into signing nondisclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:28.480]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:34.120]  legal authority for warrantless Stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:40.600]  information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.600]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.

[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.360]  day working doing good. You're still damaging your brain. Ultimately we've
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:45.080]  all been dumbed down to some degree. It doesn't have stimulus. It doesn't have

[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:18.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We now take you live to the Central
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:30.920]  Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance. Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:36.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:43.040]  David Knight on this Sunday October 25th 2015. We've been talking about Jeb Bush.
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:49.160]  As Gerald Slenty says, when people lose everything, they lose it. Well, we see Jeb Bush
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:53.720]  losing it. He's a good example of this. We just heard part of a clip. I want to
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:56.840]  finish this clip and then we're going to go to our callers. We heard this clip
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:02.400]  where he's saying, well, we don't want to have gridlock because in gridlock we're
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.520]  going to see people literally declining in their lives. In other words, if I'm
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:11.280]  not there, if Jeb Bush is not there to save you, you are literally going to have
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.440]  a decline in your life because you're not going to have new laws passed. I need to
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:19.360]  be there to run your lives for you. Let's play the rest of this clip. Absolutely
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:24.040]  amazing. You see gridlock just becomes so dominant that people literally are
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:28.240]  going to decline in their lives. That is not my motivation. I got a lot of really
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:33.000]  cool things that I could do other than sit around being miserable, listening to
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.480]  people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:42.800]  joke. Elect Trump, if you want that. He's got very things to do. And of course, he
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:48.440]  says this in this really hokey photo. If you look at this, he's sitting in a chair
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:53.240]  in front of a picture of the Lincoln Memorial where Lincoln is sitting in a
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:58.160]  chair and he is sitting there exactly like Lincoln. No subliminal messages
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.560]  there for you, okay? Sorry. Having the name Bush, sitting in front of a picture
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.080]  of Lincoln and posing like Lincoln in front of the picture of Lincoln ain't
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.920]  going to do it, Jeb. This is what's happening to the campaign. He's flashing
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:16.000]  payroll costs by 40%. He's downsizing his Miami headquarters more than 50%. He's
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.760]  reducing travel costs by 20%. He's cutting 45% of spending in areas not
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.920]  related to media and voter contact. He's letting a senior officials continue on a
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:30.440]  volunteer basis and he's letting his non-senior officials go, okay? Now, Trump
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.120]  jumped on this. Trump said, here's a guy who wants to run our country. He can't
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.800]  even run his own campaign. You know what? He's cutting back big. Bush has no money.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.320]  He's cutting. He's meeting today with mommy and daddy and they're working on
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.960]  their campaign. Yes, exactly what's happening. It was reported one of the
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.840]  headlines. There is a royal summit of the Bushes going on. They are having
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:57.480]  everyone come in. W is coming in along with mommy and daddy and they're
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:01.920]  entertaining potential donors and trying to push this. Here we go. Emergency
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:06.440]  Royal Family Meeting. Jeb to meet with former presidents Bush 41 and 43 in
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:10.840]  Houston as the campaign is struggling. Will that pull him out? I don't think so.
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:14.720]  But of course, the other part of the problem is maybe this is not a problem.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.440]  Maybe this is a feature. Maybe this is intentional. Donald Trump's speeches are
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:22.880]  at a fourth grade level. Finds a study. This is a readability test, the
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.680]  flush concave test. It ranks speeches by grade level. It finds out that those who
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.560]  are doing the best or those who are speaking at the lowest grade level,
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.320]  those who are doing the worst, are speaking at the higher grade levels in
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.680]  general. The two candidates speaking at the highest grade levels, Mike Huckabee
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:42.720]  and Jim Gilmore, are struggling in the polls. But Trump is doing well when he
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.320]  talks to people at a fourth grade level. Now, looking at the speeches from George
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:51.200]  Washington, for example, they find that he was speaking at graduate degree
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:59.040]  levels at nearly grade 18, to be exact, okay? So that would be postgraduate. They
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.840]  say Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address was at 11th grade level. I guess today
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:06.720]  you would lose the citizens right from the very beginning. When you say a four
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.560]  score and seven years ago, they'd say, what? What's that about? To give you an
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.640]  example, though, of the kind of fourth grade rhetoric that we've got going on,
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:19.640]  we've got Trump also coming after Rubio. He goes right to their home turf in
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:24.080]  Florida, and he talks about Rubio. He says, Rubio was very disloyal to Bush.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.800]  Everybody admits Bush was his mentor. They're fighting like crazy. I'm laughing,
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.960]  watching them fight. And he needs a lot of water on top of everything else,
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.520]  talking about the fact that he had to have a drink of water in the middle of
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:39.680]  his response to the State of the Union. That is really not why we shouldn't get
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.720]  Rubio. There's plenty of reasons not to have Rubio. Rubio is an open borders guy.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:52.360]  He is for the police state. He's for unlimited wars. He is for everything
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:57.200]  that is anti-freedom, essentially. But of course, this election, like most of the
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.640]  rest of the elections that we had, are going to be on personality. That's what
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:06.520]  it seems to be turning on. But it's not just Trump that's resorting to low
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.000]  levels of dialogue, low grade levels of dialogue. Of course, as I said, Bush is
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.680]  losing it. Jeb is losing it. When people asked him about what was going on with
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.600]  his campaign, his response was, blah, blah, blah. Bush said, that's my answer.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:27.800]  Blah, blah, blah. He truly is losing it. He was asked a very serious question,
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:31.640]  because again, the press wants to know what's going on with the surveillance
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.800]  data. I mean, we just passed CISA, right? They want to know what's going on with
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:39.960]  the Cloak and Dagger wars that they're creating, the CIA creating terrorist
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.640]  organizations creating wars. No, no, they're not asking about that. What they
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.200]  asked Jeb Bush about was, who are your favorite Marvel superheroes? And here's
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:54.560]  what Jeb Bush had to say. Who is your favorite superhero Marvel they have in
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:58.600]  parentheses? And why do you think this is the second time I've been asked this
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:04.320]  question? What's up with this? That people want to know. Someone told me
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.560]  there's a new Marvel shows about Ant-Man or something like that. You like that one?
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:17.880]  No, I haven't met Ant-Man yet. I like watching the movies, and I wish I owned
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:23.480]  Marvel as someone that believes in capitalism. I don't know, I'm kind of
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:28.840]  old school. I kind of like the old school guys like Batman, a little dark
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:35.760]  these days. Good choice, good choice. I saw that there's a super girl is on TV. I
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.400]  saw it on the when I was working out this morning. There's an ad promoting super
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:43.560]  girl. She looked kind of, she looked pretty hot. There you go. That's the
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:47.360]  important questions that we need to have asked in this presidential campaign. You
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:51.200]  know, they may be talking to the population at a fourth grade level
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:55.000]  because that's the kind of questions that the population wants answered. And of
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.640]  course, if anybody's paying any attention, super girl and Batman or DC comics,
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.880]  they're not even Marvel comics. But what difference does it make? I mean, who cares?
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:08.320]  Let's go to Ronnie in Texas. Ronnie, you had a comment about Ben Carson and the
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:14.600]  war on drugs. Go ahead. Well, yes, sir. Dr. Ben Carson's candidacy, the media darling
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:21.000]  Ben Carson, is supposedly absolutely blowing, not in spite of, but because of
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.680]  Dr. Ben Carson's surrender to the organized crime, the gobbly, on our
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:31.480]  overwhelmingly beneficial natural medicine called marijuana. By the way, it
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.760]  can give, I can give a personal testimonial about how tetrahydrocannabinol
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:42.560]  has helped my ongoing recovery from my own coma inducing traumatic brain injury
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:47.760]  helped save our troops with THC, helped save lives, helped save our nation by
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.920]  taking money from organized crime thugs and while helping to save our nation's
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:56.680]  struggling family farms, no matter what they grow. And by the way, Dr. Rand Paul
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:02.120]  has long been on the right side of this liberty issue here. Surprise, our lame
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.640]  scheme prostitutes are lockstep in giving Dr. Rand Paul the Dr. Ron Paul
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:12.360]  treatment by ignoring him and or dismissing him or distorting what he has
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.960]  to say. Well, I agree. I think that Ben Carson is going to be a Jimmy Carter
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.200]  type of president if he gets elected. I think he'll be easily controlled by
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:23.600]  somebody like, is the big new Brzezinski like controlled Carter or by
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.520]  somebody like Henry Kissinger. He really doesn't seem to know what's going on. I
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.240]  think he is somebody that they understand they can control. He's taken
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:36.200]  essentially down the line, the traditional GOP parting line positions.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:40.720]  And I think it's very interesting, Ronnie, that here we have a guy who's a brain
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.840]  surgeon. He says he's also a specialist on epilepsy. One of the exemptions that
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.680]  we just had put in in Texas, the only exemption for marijuana was for people
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:55.080]  who were struggling from uncontrollable seizures, continuous seizures.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:00.720]  And in most cases, these children in Texas that have or suffering from this,
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:06.560]  they got that interestingly enough as an adverse reaction to a vaccine. But we
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.240]  have Dr. Carson who says, no, we're going to tell you when you should take
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.800]  vaccines. We're going to tell you how many you should have. We're going to tell
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.000]  you which ones you're going to take and you have no informed consent in the
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.360]  matter. He supports that in principle. And then he seems to be completely clueless
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.160]  as to the adverse reactions to some of these vaccines that people have had. And
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:34.600]  the cure for it, the only cure for it, which is medical marijuana. Thanks, Ronnie.
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.200]  When we come back, we're going to take some more of your calls. We're also going
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.400]  to take a look at another political race that is very important and that is the
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:45.880]  one for Speaker. It may already be over. We may have already been betrayed by the

[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.160]  Let's go back to our callers. Stephen in Florida, you had a comment about Dr.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:36.160]  Carson and his wanting to revive the war on drugs or keep it going. Go ahead.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.160]  Yeah, hey David, before I get to that, just let me say this real quick. You're
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:44.160]  talking about the Bushes. You know, instead of the Royal Commission or
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:47.160]  committee, whatever it is you're saying they're going to get together.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:51.160]  Yeah, I really put it this way. The Nazi high command is getting together when
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:55.160]  you look at their history. Oh yeah, yeah, going back to Prescott, yeah.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:59.160]  Yeah, because they're just total scumbags supporting Planned Parenthood
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:04.160]  and everything else they've involved in. But as far as Carson, here's what I wanted
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:09.160]  to say about him. Ben Carson typifies what's wrong with Christianity in
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.160]  America because here, you know, he's talking about the war on drugs and I'm
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:18.160]  against all drugs as a Christian, but I don't do them because Jesus saved me.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.160]  That's why I gave them all up. But here's the thing. If he was really serious about
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:28.160]  going after the evils of drugs, why doesn't he get on board with
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:33.160]  outlawing the main cartel that pushes drugs? And that's the combination of the
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:39.160]  FDA, the CDC, the DEA and the pharmaceutical industry. They're the
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:44.160]  biggest drug operation in the world. But no, instead he supports them by saying
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.160]  there's no connection between autism and vaccines when it's clear there is
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.160]  and all the other things he's pushing. So my conclusion about Mr. Carson is
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:57.160]  typical of Christianity in America. He's living in a fancy world. Either he's
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:01.160]  been bought off at Big Pharma and like all the perks he gets from him being a
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:06.160]  pill-pushing priest for their eugenics religion, or he's living in a religious
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.160]  bubble and it's just totally oblivious to reality. And that's the way Christianity
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:14.160]  in America, unfortunately, to a great extent, has become. And it's no wonder
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.160]  America's in the shape of that.
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.160]  Oh, I agree. Absolutely. It's a spiritual issue. It's a psychological issue,
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:26.160]  if you will. It is not a law enforcement issue. And we have been using this
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.160]  for the last 44 years and getting awful results. We've just made everything
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.160]  worse with it. As you're pointing out, there's a new study. They came back
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:41.160]  two-thirds of people who are using antidepressant 69% don't have depression.
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:45.160]  They don't meet the qualifications for depressive disorder. They are typically
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.160]  Caucasian. They have recent or current physical problems. Or maybe they've got
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:53.160]  an insurance policy that will pay for these kinds of antidepressant drugs.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.160]  That's why it's being done. It's being done for profit. And we see that the most
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:05.160]  dangerous drugs out there are the legal SSRI drugs. That's the common link
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:10.160]  behind all these mass shootings and suicides that we see going on and on.
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:14.160]  But that's coming from big farmers. So you're not going to hear Dr. Carson
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:17.160]  or any of the Republican candidates or Democrat candidates, for that matter,
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:21.160]  talking about that. Thank you, Steve. Let's go to Joe in Arkansas. You want to
[01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:24.160]  make a comment on conservatives and the UN agenda. Go ahead.
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.160]  Yeah, you were talking about how conservatives support the UN agenda
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:30.160]  when they support the war on drugs. And I wanted to point out another place
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:34.160]  where conservatives are supporting the UN agenda. And that's when they support
[01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:38.160]  free trade. And if you read UN Agenda 21, you'll see that the first thing that
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:42.160]  it calls for before it gets into the environmental stuff is it calls for
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:47.160]  getting rid of all protectionism so that the wealth of the more developed
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.160]  countries can be transferred to the third world. And also in the 1963
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:55.160]  congressional record where it listed the current goals of the Communist Party
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:59.160]  of the United States, one of them was free trade with all countries,
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.160]  regardless of communist affiliation, such as maybe China. And Carl Marx said
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:08.160]  that he, in 1848, Carl Marx said that he was in favor of free trade because
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:11.160]  it would increase the gap between the rich and poor. It would exaggerate
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:15.160]  and intensify class warfare. And it would make it easier to recreate working
[01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:20.160]  people to support socialism. And the Republicans in the late 19th
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.160]  and early 20th century, there were strong supporters of protectionism.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.160]  There were strong supporters of terrorist unimport. And it was because of that
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:31.160]  that the United States, during that time, became the greatest manufacturing
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.160]  country in the strongest economy in the world. And of course, now we see
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:38.160]  when we've gotten rid of that, when we've gone to the communist way of free trade,
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:44.160]  we're declining as a manufacturing power and an economic power in the world.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.160]  I would agree with what you say about free trade. And I would say that when you
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:50.160]  look at these free trade agreements, though, it's even worse than that.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:55.160]  Because these are globalist agreements. These are, as Senator Sessions
[01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:59.160]  looked at it, he said, you are creating a transnational governance.
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:03.160]  Once you create these so-called treaties, and they're going to do them by
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:07.160]  ignoring the constitutional process for passing treaties, once you pass these
[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:12.160]  still secret treaties, you are going to allow this transnational committee
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.160]  to alter this without any further input from any state legislatures.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:20.160]  They can add different countries to this agreement. They can change
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:23.160]  everything about the agreement. And of course, they are going to be above
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:27.160]  the nations who sign on to this agreement. So in many ways, this is about
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:32.160]  our internet freedom, it's about sovereignty, and it is not simply about free trade.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:35.160]  We can have that discussion about free trade, but it is about globalism.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:38.160]  And when we look at this, we need to understand how the conservatives
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:42.160]  have betrayed us on the speakership position. Some conservatives got together
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:46.160]  and they pushed out Boehner, but now when it comes to getting his replacement,
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:50.160]  it looks like Paul Ryan is going to be a shoe-in. Why? Because conservative
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:55.160]  opposition to him has folded, and it has folded because we've got people like
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:59.160]  the Heritage Foundation, very conservative mainstream conservative organizations,
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:03.160]  people like Jim DeMint, now throwing their backing behind Paul Ryan.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:09.160]  And Paul Ryan supports this secret treaty that we still don't know what's in it.
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:13.160]  He also has supported his entire career. Even going back to being a staffer
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:17.160]  with Jack Kemp, he supported open borders, open immigration.
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:21.160]  It's a total betrayal of what we're looking at in a course with open borders
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:25.160]  and with transnational governance. Both these treaties and the open borders
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:30.160]  are about creating a globalist governance. If you go back and you look at
[01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.160]  what's going on with these trade agreements and you look at what Paul Ryan did,
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:37.160]  he was called on this by a fellow congressman. He said,
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:41.160]  you read through this language down in the secret room talking to Mr. Ryan.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:45.160]  And he said, and I welcome the day when people can read it. Ryan responded.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:49.160]  It could be read by the general public once it's agreed to. Well, he's lying about that.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.160]  It's been about three weeks now that they said they've agreed to,
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.160]  they've reached an agreement on this, and we still haven't been able to see what's in it.
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:55:00.160]  He says this caused some to recall that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.160]  reference to the contents of Obamacare, where she said, we have to pass the bill
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:09.160]  so you can find out what's in it. That's the kind of person that the conservatives are now pushing.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.160]  Somebody who has supported open borders and amnesty for his entire political career,
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:20.160]  who supports a secret trade agreement, who has worked with Obama on both of these globalist agendas.
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:27.160]  Thank you, Joe. Let's go to Joe in southern Indiana. You wanted to talk about Benghazi. Go ahead.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:35.160]  I would like to know why the congressional committee did not make a major issue out of
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:46.160]  who ordered a stand down that prevented a military action to rescue and respond to the heroic,
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:55.160]  epic, heroic efforts of three soldiers who disobeyed orders to stand down and went to the rescue
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:00.160]  knowing they were going to die because there were hundreds of attackers.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.160]  Yes.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:08.160]  And who ordered that stand down and whoever did should be tried for treason
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:14.160]  because they went against everything that every true military man and soldier believes in,
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.160]  which is that you go to the help of those under attack.
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:25.160]  Exactly. And that goes back, Joe, to the issues about whether or not Benghazi was the hub of an arms trade
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.160]  that was going on with the CIA, whether they wanted to cover that up.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:34.160]  And it also, I would say, suggests that the person who came up with all of these phony stories
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:41.160]  in the wake of what happened, talking about how it was a reaction to some obscure film that nobody had seen
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:46.160]  and nobody would possibly take seriously, leading to the arrest of that filmmaker,
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:48.160]  that would be Hillary Clinton.
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:52.160]  So we see a massive campaign of lies that were changing on a daily basis.
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:58.160]  In the wake of that, we see that we had secure documents that were being kept on her email.
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:01.160]  We see just a trail of lies. I agree with you.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:03.160]  There's so many different aspects of Benghazi.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.160]  That's why this has gone on for so long, but that's her strategy.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:13.160]  The Clintons love to let these investigations just drag on and on and on until people's eyes glaze over
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:16.160]  and they fall asleep, and that's been a very effective strategy.
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:19.160]  Let's go real quickly if we've got time. Well, we don't have time.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:25.160]  I wanted to get to Maggie in Texas to get her comments about the BLM and the horses, but we just don't have time.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:32.160]  So sorry. Join us tomorrow. We'll be back at 11 Central, 12 Eastern for the Alex Jones radio show.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:37.160]  That's it for today's broadcast.
