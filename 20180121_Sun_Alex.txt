[00:00.000 --> 00:18.840]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18.840 --> 00:25.000]  It's Sunday, the 21st day of January 2018.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.520]  This is the hated broadcast.
[00:26.520 --> 00:28.400]  This is the enemy of the globalist.
[00:28.400 --> 00:34.680]  This is what mainstream media corrupt governments across the world absolutely hate because we
[00:34.680 --> 00:36.600]  have their number.
[00:36.600 --> 00:42.960]  We are aware of their activities and we are exposing it in a big, big way.
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.080]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday Transmission.
[00:47.080 --> 00:49.920]  We're going to be here for the next two hours.
[00:49.920 --> 00:53.880]  Roger Stone will join us with big breaking news in the last 30 minutes of the transmission.
[00:53.880 --> 01:00.760]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11am central with the weekday broadcast that airs for four hours.
[01:00.760 --> 01:01.760]  Wow.
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.240]  I mean, every time I start the show, I say wow, but somehow I've got to cover all this
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.240]  today.
[01:08.240 --> 01:09.240]  Look at this headline.
[01:09.240 --> 01:18.680]  Google has an actual secret speech police.
[01:18.680 --> 01:26.680]  Britain's automated grocery store of the future opens Monday.
[01:26.680 --> 01:32.840]  This city has been shaken for seven straight days by earthquakes in the U.S., Reno, Nevada.
[01:32.840 --> 01:35.080]  That's just one of the stacks.
[01:35.080 --> 01:40.880]  Britt Teen Hacker poses CIA boss to access secret military files.
[01:40.880 --> 01:44.400]  I could talk for the whole two hours about that one article.
[01:44.400 --> 01:50.160]  I'm just letting you in on my frustration and then it continues.
[01:50.160 --> 01:52.960]  I'm not even going from the most important news to the least important.
[01:52.960 --> 01:54.800]  I'm just starting at one point.
[01:54.800 --> 02:05.800]  Feds collect record taxes through November, still run a $201 billion deficit, GOP bouncing
[02:05.800 --> 02:13.120]  back in 2018 polls after tax cuts, that's their fake polls, markets brush off U.S. government
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.200]  shutdowns, we're going to get into all the details of the shutdown and what's behind
[02:18.200 --> 02:19.200]  that.
[02:19.200 --> 02:22.640]  I mean, it's the obstructionist Democrats trying to hold the country hostage.
[02:22.640 --> 02:24.920]  You just have unlimited open borders.
[02:24.920 --> 02:25.920]  The U.N.
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.640]  goal of Peter Sutherland who died last week and if Trump wants it to be reasonable, well,
[02:30.640 --> 02:34.520]  that's not going to happen because the globalists know they can flood any Western country they
[02:34.520 --> 02:38.480]  want with illegals, turn them into political operatives and then out and vote anybody.
[02:38.480 --> 02:40.080]  They use our openness against us.
[02:40.080 --> 02:41.080]  That's coming up.
[02:41.080 --> 02:47.440]  Also, we already knew this, I've talked about this a lot, Illinois, California and other
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.160]  states have passed in their legislatures bills to legalize illegal aliens voting.
[02:53.160 --> 02:56.840]  Then they go on the news and say, we don't want illegals to vote, that's a right-wing
[02:56.840 --> 02:57.840]  conspiracy theory.
[02:57.840 --> 03:05.080]  Well, here's an article, majors state to registry legal aliens to vote automatically
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.200]  and that's California, so that's coming up.
[03:10.200 --> 03:16.280]  Anything of that with 25,339 murders we know of in 2017, Mexico suffers record homicide
[03:16.280 --> 03:17.280]  tally.
[03:17.280 --> 03:24.600]  But we should just open ourselves up to what's happening down there because a very small
[03:24.600 --> 03:31.920]  minority of people in Mexico are homicidal maniacs.
[03:31.920 --> 03:34.920]  But still, it's one of the largest percentages.
[03:34.920 --> 03:40.880]  This is very, very interesting sociology, psychology, demography, when Mexico is one
[03:40.880 --> 03:47.200]  of the peacefulest low crime nice areas in the general public, the main spectrum.
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.640]  And then they've got a very small group that is the most psychotic murdering you can imagine
[03:51.640 --> 03:55.360]  on the planet and not afraid of anything as well.
[03:55.360 --> 04:00.320]  So we're going to look at those numbers and it ties into this guy that killed the cops
[04:00.320 --> 04:02.680]  says I can't wait to get out to kill more.
[04:02.680 --> 04:05.400]  And then Trump puts a video out about it and he goes, oh, you're racist.
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.240]  I mean, there are white serial killers, there are brown serial killers, there are black
[04:10.240 --> 04:13.560]  serial killers, there are albino serial killers.
[04:13.560 --> 04:16.200]  They're almost all male, but they're male.
[04:16.200 --> 04:19.880]  You want to blame some group, but they're all colors.
[04:19.880 --> 04:25.080]  And the idea that these crazy people, you can't criticize them because one is a Mexican
[04:25.080 --> 04:26.240]  is insane.
[04:26.240 --> 04:27.960]  So that is coming up.
[04:27.960 --> 04:33.400]  Meanwhile, some really good news, science is revolutionizing arguments about abortion
[04:33.400 --> 04:39.400]  and that ties into Planned Parenthood, condemns house passage and building sure babies born
[04:39.400 --> 04:42.920]  alive during abortion receive care because they actually harvest them and keep them
[04:42.920 --> 04:44.840]  to get their organs and stuff for a couple of hours.
[04:44.840 --> 04:46.240]  Of course, that should be illegal.
[04:46.240 --> 04:50.320]  I mean, you're going to butcher the meat, throw it the trash, don't let the mothers know
[04:50.320 --> 04:52.760]  it's worth a couple hundred thousand dollars.
[04:52.760 --> 04:55.400]  Mothers ought to just be surrogates and grow the meat up and sell it if you're going to
[04:55.400 --> 04:56.400]  be liberal.
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.240]  Shouldn't you make money, ladies?
[05:00.240 --> 05:02.360]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[05:02.360 --> 05:03.360]  Go ahead.
[05:03.360 --> 05:05.080]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[05:05.080 --> 05:09.040]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[05:09.040 --> 05:10.040]  It just gets old, man.
[05:10.040 --> 05:13.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.240]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[05:15.240 --> 05:19.400]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.200]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm if that was happening to anybody else, I'd be
[05:24.200 --> 05:25.200]  freaked out.
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.680]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[05:28.680 --> 05:29.680]  You know what, Alex?
[05:29.680 --> 05:30.680]  I put him on pause again.
[05:30.680 --> 05:36.200]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[05:36.200 --> 05:38.080]  under attack, we need your help.
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.440]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[05:42.440 --> 05:45.480]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[05:45.480 --> 05:46.480]  Do you understand?
[05:46.480 --> 05:47.480]  I need your help, Frank.
[05:47.480 --> 05:49.960]  I need your help, Frank.
[05:49.960 --> 05:55.560]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund The Info War.
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.560]  Do you understand?
[05:56.560 --> 05:57.960]  I need your help, Frank.
[05:57.960 --> 06:26.640]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[06:26.640 --> 06:32.040]  Here we are, Sunday, the 21st of January, 2018, we're going to be live over the next
[06:32.040 --> 06:39.560]  two hours, and I want to go right into the news because there is so much of it to cover.
[06:39.560 --> 06:41.160]  We're going to get into government shutdown.
[06:41.160 --> 06:46.360]  We're going to get into the new military developments that are taking place, and Communist
[06:46.360 --> 06:52.600]  China caught involved in so many of our even local government activities.
[06:52.600 --> 06:56.800]  That's finally even hitting the Washington Post, even Jeff Bezos, I guess, can tell the
[06:56.800 --> 06:58.200]  truth occasionally.
[06:58.200 --> 07:05.320]  That is all coming up, but first off, a big deal.
[07:05.320 --> 07:11.040]  The media, the controlled corporate media made a lot of jokes about it, what four months
[07:11.040 --> 07:17.120]  ago when the Vegas attack happened, three, four months ago, and they said, Jones doesn't
[07:17.120 --> 07:24.920]  have FBI hostage rescue team sources, and of course I do, in that case.
[07:24.920 --> 07:28.600]  And I just said that they said that there was paraphernalia going to the Middle East,
[07:28.600 --> 07:34.800]  literature, anti-philiterature, that he was shooting up inside the hotel down the hallways,
[07:34.800 --> 07:41.080]  that there was other shooting going on in the city that night, and that there was a cover-up
[07:41.080 --> 07:46.400]  going on, and that there had been a big Islamic convention going on, the Saudi Arabian military
[07:46.400 --> 07:53.480]  was having a convention that week in Vegas, and that's what I got the days after.
[07:53.480 --> 08:02.120]  Then I had a high-level Army Special Operations Command source basically confirm everything
[08:02.120 --> 08:07.320]  that we already knew, and then say, get ready for this to happen, and what Zach said then
[08:07.320 --> 08:12.960]  came true, and the FBI came and picked him up, took him into the military base there
[08:12.960 --> 08:16.560]  in Florida, and then they just told him, watch what he said, but he didn't give anything
[08:16.560 --> 08:21.440]  out classified, because as a citizen he gave his view on things that got people to connect
[08:21.440 --> 08:22.440]  the dots.
[08:22.440 --> 08:31.080]  The reason I say that is, you get next year's news today, you get tomorrow's news today,
[08:31.080 --> 08:34.920]  just like it was first four months ago that Roger Stone said that the head of CNN would
[08:34.920 --> 08:48.320]  be out by early 2018, and that indeed that's now happened, head of CNN was signed Friday
[08:48.320 --> 08:55.720]  night, Zucker, and I'm not going to tell you how Roger knew that, but I mean I didn't just
[08:55.720 --> 09:00.720]  believe my reporter, you know I believe him, I wanted the details, and he trusted me off
[09:00.720 --> 09:08.160]  record I got him, that came directly, not from the president, but from the people that
[09:08.160 --> 09:13.160]  own CNN, I mean I'm going to leave it at that, Roger's coming up later in the next
[09:13.160 --> 09:21.360]  hour, but again he may just go ahead and tell you, but that came directly from the people
[09:21.360 --> 09:28.280]  that employed that guy at dinner, and I'm allowed to say that part, because he said
[09:28.280 --> 09:36.800]  that four months ago, so and of course you already ran CNN into the ground, so why not
[09:36.800 --> 09:42.400]  run ESPN, ESPN's ratings are down what 30% is like the NFL, after all their SJW crap,
[09:42.400 --> 09:48.800]  so just put that smug person that thinks that people want to look at other smug sociopath
[09:48.800 --> 09:53.840]  data males on rampaging power trips trying to be somebody, and that's the guy that gave
[09:53.840 --> 10:05.000]  you Brian Stelter, so it's like psychopaths on parade, losers on parade, guys that screwed
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.120]  the pooch on parade, it's just amazing, but people are okay, okay he said that would happen
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.520]  and happen, he's got a lot of the big news that he's going to exclusively give you in
[10:14.520 --> 10:20.020]  the last 30 minutes, now that said let's get back into Vegas, because they say what happens
[10:20.020 --> 10:26.480]  in Vegas stays in Vegas, which is why I've never done anything in Vegas, because they
[10:26.480 --> 10:30.720]  tell you something stays somewhere and that's their logo that you can believe it's the opposite,
[10:30.720 --> 10:37.240]  what you do in Vegas you get compromised with in Vegas, but we've got the reports right
[10:37.240 --> 10:43.080]  here on infowars.com, I smell a rat, Republican congressman claims he has credible evidence
[10:43.080 --> 10:48.040]  that ISIS was behind Las Vegas shooting despite the FBI and police saying that government
[10:48.040 --> 10:53.280]  Stephen Paddock acted alone, but then you actually read what the congressman Perry of Pennsylvania
[10:53.280 --> 11:00.320]  is saying on Tucker Carlson Friday night, it's up on infowars.com, the newswars.com
[11:00.320 --> 11:07.840]  right now, he said they took credit, they posted a graphic of the Vegas skyline with
[11:07.840 --> 11:13.120]  that Mandalay building right in the middle a week before, and they took credit, and ISIS
[11:13.120 --> 11:18.760]  only takes credit for stuff they've actually done or been part of, but forget that, he
[11:18.760 --> 11:25.880]  said I've got other intel, well I mean I know the intel, we've gotten information from the
[11:25.880 --> 11:31.920]  FBI hostage rescue team members at least three times, and I'm not going to get into all those
[11:31.920 --> 11:37.600]  cases here, but I was told about it the morning after, I was told don't report it yet, I got
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.400]  a text saying go ahead and report it, I reported it on air that day, the media made a big joke
[11:42.400 --> 11:48.160]  about it, like oh Jones is looking at his phone just making it up, oh yeah, like the
[11:48.160 --> 11:52.080]  times I've been on air and Trump calls me or the times I've been on air, and this is
[11:52.080 --> 11:55.680]  just sick, how they sit there and we have this track record, they know it's real, that's
[11:55.680 --> 11:58.880]  why they hate us, and people know that we're willing to report the truth, we're willing
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.480]  to stick our necks out there, and so that's why they play these games, but now you've
[12:02.480 --> 12:07.600]  got the, in the last week, you notice the congressman came out the day after the sheriff
[12:07.600 --> 12:12.160]  came out and said okay the FBI's reporting, there could be other shooters, other people
[12:12.160 --> 12:17.000]  involved, and they're looking at gun running, because Paddock's in the emails saying he's
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.480]  gun running, that's exactly what all our sources from the FBI and the Pentagon, which means
[12:24.480 --> 12:29.560]  the CIA, the CIA connected Pentagon, that's special operations, that's what they told
[12:29.560 --> 12:32.960]  us, and these are the good guys that continue to give us good info, it doesn't mean the
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.920]  whole thing's good, there's a civil war in America right now, one group wanted to totally
[12:38.920 --> 12:43.200]  sell out the Congress Chinese, that's coming up in the next segment, the other group isn't
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.760]  out to rape America completely, so you're kind of stuck between that, but just remember
[12:49.760 --> 12:56.400]  what we told you the day it happened, and those videos are up on infowars.com, info wars
[12:56.400 --> 13:05.720]  vindicated, FBI investigating, second shooters, gun running, boom, precisely what we told
[13:05.720 --> 13:13.360]  you, day one, and then our reporters got you the intel on how many people were inside,
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.240]  and the girlfriend visiting days before, and shooting up inside the hotel, and trying
[13:17.240 --> 13:21.860]  to blow up the fuel tanks, and the helicopter activity, and the Islamists having a big meeting
[13:21.860 --> 13:26.680]  that week they're in town, and of course then they can't bring guns in, so they contact
[13:26.680 --> 13:29.640]  a known gun runner, they've already gotten weapons for her in the Middle East, who's
[13:29.640 --> 13:35.640]  really a CIA contractor, Patek, they had him show up, kill him, use that as the cover to
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.680]  launch the attack, as a threat to Trump, don't try to cut us off in Saudi Arabia, that Trump
[13:41.680 --> 13:47.040]  was already planning the next week, which we did, because they had operatives inside
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.040]  our own military, and inside the CIA like Brennan, and others that told the Saudis what
[13:53.040 --> 13:59.600]  was coming, and they decided to run that threat to piss in Trump Cheerios, and so I don't
[13:59.600 --> 14:03.400]  like covering up real news, and I understand why the President sat back and didn't create
[14:03.400 --> 14:08.320]  a panic, he was about to move against him the next week, but then other people decided
[14:08.320 --> 14:11.880]  it was important that this not be blamed on gun owners, and so that the truth should
[14:11.880 --> 14:16.280]  limited be given to you, because you're aware and know what's going on, particularly the
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.840]  military and law enforcement listed on this channel, so they wanted you to know, that's
[14:21.840 --> 14:30.320]  what happened, and that's why you were given the information, Alex Jones, the Vegas shooting
[14:30.320 --> 14:36.080]  was real, it was part of a Saudi civil war, there it is, November 29th, but that was weeks
[14:36.080 --> 14:43.200]  and weeks after what happened on November 1st, so we're giving you the best intel there
[14:43.200 --> 14:47.280]  is, and again, that's why they hate us, because they know we've got a platform, we're willing
[14:47.280 --> 14:53.000]  to tell the truth, and we've got armed guard stationed around, and all the rest of us,
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.520]  we can carry this out, because it's gone to that level, now that said, just pay attention
[14:57.520 --> 15:00.720]  to what we cover here, because we're trying to tell you the truth, we've got a good track
[15:00.720 --> 15:05.060]  record of being right, doesn't mean we're perfect, so check what we say as well, a Vegas
[15:05.060 --> 15:11.120]  sheriff, FBI's ongoing case against individual other than Paddock, as he said in the beginning,
[15:11.120 --> 15:14.760]  before they clamped down on him, he said he had help obviously, as any other people,
[15:14.760 --> 15:20.360]  the FBI has an ongoing case against individuals of federal interest, but meanwhile, thousands
[15:20.360 --> 15:24.960]  of newspapers like the Washington Post attacked Congressman Perry, saying channeling conspiracy
[15:24.960 --> 15:29.320]  theory, congressman says Las Vegas attacked, linked the possible terrorist nexus, he didn't
[15:29.320 --> 15:33.800]  just say he thought it, because ISIS took responsibility, he said I've been given information

[20:03.440 --> 20:26.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:26.640 --> 20:37.880]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:37.880 --> 20:43.600]  What incredible news have you just joined us up on InfoWars.com, all the videos, all the
[20:43.600 --> 20:49.520]  reports from back in November last year, we broke it all down, the FBI's investigating
[20:49.520 --> 20:53.920]  multiple shooters, Saudi Arabia and civil war connections, gun running, everything we
[20:53.920 --> 21:02.160]  told you day one, but it was so shocking that this happened that it was basically deep
[21:02.160 --> 21:09.440]  checked because they thought the public couldn't handle it and of course you saw then what
[21:09.440 --> 21:16.360]  happened in Saudi Arabia, thousands of people arrested, hundreds killed, big firefights,
[21:16.360 --> 21:21.320]  very prints that had already been fingered and reported to be connected to it, arrested,
[21:21.320 --> 21:25.280]  that's the big news and you saw what happened now.
[21:25.280 --> 21:28.600]  More on that coming up, let's get into the big news everybody wants to know about because
[21:28.600 --> 21:30.680]  the media is making a big deal out of it.
[21:30.680 --> 21:36.600]  This is purely political, the government shut down, the Democrats are targeting critical
[21:36.600 --> 21:43.280]  infrastructure areas and refusing to vote on it because they want under globalism to
[21:43.280 --> 21:49.120]  make the central government capitulate to bring in illegals that the media has branded
[21:49.120 --> 21:57.040]  and brainwashed to be Democrats and who are then kept as illegals as a permanent underclass
[21:57.040 --> 22:02.320]  to be exploited to drive down wages just like NAFTA and GATT and all these different systems
[22:02.320 --> 22:05.160]  have been engaged in.
[22:05.160 --> 22:10.800]  And so you got Trump and his State of the Union coming up this next week and the word
[22:10.800 --> 22:15.280]  is that is meant to embarrass the president ahead of all this and to hopefully kill the
[22:15.280 --> 22:20.560]  stock market and kill the recovery, you can argue well it's a big bubble, well if it's
[22:20.560 --> 22:25.880]  a bubble to bring industry back and infrastructure it's not a bubble and you got all these people
[22:25.880 --> 22:30.280]  heavily invested in China like Peter Schiff is a nice guy, whatever I don't blame him
[22:30.280 --> 22:35.120]  making a buck, heavily invested in China and he's betting against America and they'll
[22:35.120 --> 22:38.880]  sit there and tell you oh China's in a much better position but you look at the numbers,
[22:38.880 --> 22:42.920]  that's not the case, they are tenfold the amount of quantitative easing we're involved
[22:42.920 --> 22:47.720]  in, Trump has increased its sum and tried to boost things but mainly done it through
[22:47.720 --> 22:52.960]  exuberance and small businesses to invest, the biggest growth here is record small business
[22:52.960 --> 22:59.200]  growth, record unemployment for African Americans and others and that's the real numbers because
[22:59.200 --> 23:05.160]  people believe in the future and if you don't have exuberance you have nothing so there's
[23:05.160 --> 23:13.280]  a major attempt to sabotage that going on right now and it's a shame but here's some
[23:13.280 --> 23:21.040]  of the headlines, GOP bounces back in 2018 polls after tax cuts, that's Axios, you know
[23:21.040 --> 23:27.200]  what's funny is these polls all sample 9, 10, 15, 20 up to 30 plus points but usually
[23:27.200 --> 23:31.680]  about 9 to 10 points, 15 points, it's all in that area 9 to 15, there's the average
[23:31.680 --> 23:38.920]  by 12, they usually sample 12 points more Democrat so it doesn't matter, okay Republicans
[23:38.920 --> 23:44.440]  are suddenly up to 50 or whatever, it means they're at 60 or 65, just like people are
[23:44.440 --> 23:49.280]  like oh the New York Times says Trump's going to lose by 98% on election day, I told you
[23:49.280 --> 23:55.800]  that was malarkey and the real fight was over could they steal the election, they stole
[23:55.800 --> 24:01.960]  six states, tried to steal five others, always flip it, stole five states, tried to steal
[24:01.960 --> 24:06.740]  six, no, no they stole five, tried to steal six, that's right and the state heads came
[24:06.740 --> 24:11.120]  out and said homeland security was breaking into our computers flipping votes while we
[24:11.120 --> 24:16.520]  were in there watching it, I mean this is crazy, let me move along, got like 20 articles
[24:16.520 --> 24:21.520]  on this one subject and a bunch of clips coming up in the next segment, markets brush off
[24:21.520 --> 24:27.880]  government shutdowns, it's more a political event than an economic one, Reuters, absolutely
[24:27.880 --> 24:35.240]  that's exactly what's going on, it's a stunt, Trump tells GOP to go nuclear a showdown fight
[24:35.240 --> 24:41.000]  enters day two, he says use the 51 vote to bypass obstructionist dims if they refuse
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.840]  the votes before, boy they really ruled the day they, they thought Hillary would have
[24:44.840 --> 24:51.040]  that, but now just, now Trump's got it, so there's some argument parliamentary wise they
[24:51.040 --> 24:58.600]  can do that but it's just crazy, it's absolutely crazy and imagine the democrats juxtaposing
[24:58.600 --> 25:05.320]  themselves here where, we're going to let illegal aliens be legalized but we're not
[25:05.320 --> 25:14.640]  going to pay the post office and the marine corps, it's like what, and then Trump we learn
[25:14.640 --> 25:18.600]  was ready to legalize 800,000 people this week who have no criminal records, have been
[25:18.600 --> 25:22.880]  living here for decades, I say legalize them too, I don't, that vet people, they're not
[25:22.880 --> 25:26.520]  criminals, they're hard working, bring them in, we need people, that's what he said during
[25:26.520 --> 25:32.160]  the campaign, the media shed he hated all Mexicans and said they were all criminals, when he
[25:32.160 --> 25:37.000]  said wonderful people, great people, I love the Mexican people but a lot of criminals,
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.680]  a lot of bad people coming in, we got to stop them, and the conservatives again go oh you're,
[25:42.680 --> 25:46.720]  you're supposed to hate all the Mexicans, we heard that, some of them are racist, you
[25:46.720 --> 25:51.360]  know they're, it's all smoke and mirrors but see I have a memory and I have the videos
[25:51.360 --> 25:58.080]  and I have the transcripts so Trump is sickeningly at an OCD level, the democrats hate, following
[25:58.080 --> 26:03.240]  what he said he would do and they don't like it, because with Trump there's not a bunch
[26:03.240 --> 26:06.640]  of smoke and mirrors, they're just, this is what I'm going to do, I'm going to deliver
[26:06.640 --> 26:12.360]  it, if you want that that's fine and if America rejects that, you know what, I'm a smart
[26:12.360 --> 26:16.960]  guy, I'm going to be okay either way, but I feel sorry for the average person that took
[26:16.960 --> 26:24.040]  prosperity, took a gift horse and basically shot at the head for no reason, why do you
[26:24.040 --> 26:26.600]  look a gift horse in the mouth, you know if you're going to buy a horse you check its
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.000]  teeth to see how long it can live or how healthy it is, this is what it gives you a horse,
[26:31.000 --> 26:35.480]  you don't look a gift horse in the mouth, but then again you can take a horse to water
[26:35.480 --> 26:41.760]  but you can't make it drink and the metaphors and cliches just go on from there, I mean
[26:41.760 --> 26:46.920]  this is jackass behavior going on, total jackass behavior.
[26:46.920 --> 26:52.440]  So continuing here with this, Pence says, I'm going to play this clip first, I'm going
[26:52.440 --> 26:57.920]  to play this clip right now, Pence says immigration talks over until government reopens and he's
[26:57.920 --> 27:03.840]  there with the military because they're using the illegals as babies and crying on TV, humanizing
[27:03.840 --> 27:07.360]  them, the media goes how dare him give a speech in front of the military, they're the ones
[27:07.360 --> 27:10.480]  that aren't going to get their paycheck the next few weeks, when a lot of them are living
[27:10.480 --> 27:14.680]  paycheck to paycheck very low pay, Trump has increased the pay like 20% thank God the first
[27:14.680 --> 27:21.600]  time in over 15 years with inflation it's not even an increase, it's just median fairness
[27:21.600 --> 27:27.080]  and they spin it like Pence is bad when he's saying hey these are people too, here it is.
[27:27.080 --> 27:32.280]  I'm sure you're all aware of what's going on in Washington DC, despite bipartisan support
[27:32.280 --> 27:37.320]  for a budget resolution, a minority in the Senate has decided to play politics with military
[27:37.320 --> 27:43.000]  pay, but you deserve better, you and your family shouldn't have to worry for one minute
[27:43.000 --> 27:48.240]  about whether you're going to get paid as you serve in the uniform of the United States.
[27:48.240 --> 27:54.480]  So know this, your president, your vice president and the American people are not going to put
[27:54.480 --> 28:04.360]  up with it.
[28:04.360 --> 28:07.880]  We're going to demand that they reopen the government, in fact we're not going to reopen
[28:07.880 --> 28:13.040]  negotiations on illegal immigration until they reopen the government and give you our
[28:13.040 --> 28:19.480]  soldiers and your families the benefits and wages you've earned.
[28:19.480 --> 28:24.360]  And then I've got all the articles here saying it's dangerous in front of the military, they're
[28:24.360 --> 28:28.800]  the ones you're screwing, so you've got countless shows crying for the illegal aliens all the
[28:28.800 --> 28:55.200]  rest of it, we're going to show who you're actually screwing.
[28:58.800 --> 29:02.640]  Not a group you develop living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[29:02.640 --> 29:04.360]  Why is this so good?
[29:04.360 --> 29:09.040]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[29:09.040 --> 29:13.680]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[29:13.680 --> 29:19.360]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[29:19.360 --> 29:22.720]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[29:22.720 --> 29:27.800]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[29:27.800 --> 29:29.040]  going on everywhere.
[29:29.040 --> 29:30.040]  These are all parasites.
[29:30.040 --> 29:32.760]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said, there's so many things that are in it.
[29:32.760 --> 29:37.720]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, I recommend
[29:37.720 --> 29:40.440]  doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[29:40.440 --> 29:43.720]  Alright well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today, I just
[29:43.720 --> 29:48.240]  came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com and folks you can't lose, it's full of stuff

[31:13.400 --> 31:14.840]  and normal breathing.
[31:14.840 --> 31:15.840]  This is pollen block.
[31:15.840 --> 31:21.160]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[31:21.160 --> 31:27.240]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[31:27.240 --> 31:28.840]  and excessive mucus production.
[31:28.840 --> 31:33.680]  They began studying the effects in their public trials.
[31:33.680 --> 31:39.800]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets

[33:23.440 --> 33:28.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:28.240 --> 33:35.160]  If you want to stop tyranny, well so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's
[33:35.160 --> 33:38.160]  Alex Jones.
[33:38.160 --> 33:45.360]  So Facebook, Google, and it's a YouTube platform, Twitter, you name it.
[33:45.360 --> 33:51.360]  They're all announcing massive plans to ban all pro-Trump, all pro-America statements.
[33:51.360 --> 33:54.600]  We have the articles right here.
[33:54.600 --> 33:58.680]  And the new Facebook statement is, Google says we're hiring secret police to watch you
[33:58.680 --> 33:59.680]  and then ban you.
[33:59.680 --> 34:02.680]  They're working with the German government if you've criticized somebody raping your
[34:02.680 --> 34:03.680]  daughter.
[34:03.680 --> 34:06.760]  They're Islamic, you know, you get arrested.
[34:06.760 --> 34:12.680]  Facebook is going to start surveying users to determine trustworthy news sources.
[34:12.680 --> 34:17.280]  So they're already run by the ADL, the Southern Primary Law Center and these other think tanks
[34:17.280 --> 34:19.120]  that tell them what to ban and block.
[34:19.120 --> 34:24.440]  But now, oh, because of lawsuits, we're going to go to our trusted users, leftist.
[34:24.440 --> 34:27.400]  And then they'll say, what's real and what's not.
[34:27.400 --> 34:34.200]  That's like Hitler going to a Nuremberg rally and saying, tell me who to kill, Jews!
[34:34.200 --> 34:38.200]  Or to Klan rally in 1930s Alabama, who do we go after, the blacks!
[34:38.200 --> 34:43.720]  Who do we go after today, the conservatives, the libertarians, the Christians, we're going
[34:43.720 --> 34:46.360]  to get them!
[34:46.360 --> 34:50.960]  And they go, oh, our users voted to not allow you to share on Facebook.
[34:50.960 --> 34:56.520]  I'm sorry, but they choose the users they want for that determination.
[34:56.520 --> 35:01.400]  And they admit that they're nudging us and bullying us and intimidating us to go along
[35:01.400 --> 35:02.400]  with this.
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.960]  Because after all Zuckerberg said, I can't believe, I can't believe our users trust us,
[35:08.960 --> 35:09.960]  the dumb Fs.
[35:09.960 --> 35:13.720]  Yeah, that's out of the verge.
[35:13.720 --> 35:14.720]  Here's another one.
[35:14.720 --> 35:18.280]  Google has an actual secret speech police.
[35:18.280 --> 35:24.120]  It says it's run by the Anti-Defamation League and a European organization, the EU government,
[35:24.120 --> 35:27.200]  and it tells you what you can see.
[35:27.200 --> 35:28.200]  Isn't that sweet?
[35:28.200 --> 35:32.320]  It's a daily caller, it's just, you know, it's been out for months, but just there
[35:32.320 --> 35:33.600]  they are right about today.
[35:33.600 --> 35:35.600]  I mean, think about how creepy that is.
[35:35.600 --> 35:41.640]  And then now, Amazon's bought three different grocery store chains, including Whole Foods,
[35:41.640 --> 35:46.000]  and they're getting rid of the people that announced it'll be all automated this year
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.560]  at many other stores, and that's okay because the trendies that are there, they just want
[35:50.560 --> 35:53.000]  to commit suicide.
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.320]  They hate serving you anyways.
[35:54.320 --> 35:55.440]  They love Amazon.
[35:55.440 --> 35:59.400]  They love being replaced because it's trendy.
[35:59.400 --> 36:02.720]  They're not mad at that big corrupt mega corporation displacing humans.
[36:02.720 --> 36:03.720]  Oh, no, no, no.
[36:03.720 --> 36:05.880]  As long as it displaces everyone, it's good.
[36:05.880 --> 36:15.400]  As long as Bezos justice signals when he shoots you in the back of the head financially,
[36:15.400 --> 36:17.200]  it's okay.
[36:17.200 --> 36:21.000]  Just say black lives matter and you can abort all the black babies.
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.080]  Walk up to the black woman, just stab her right in the neck and go, black lives matter.
[36:24.080 --> 36:27.000]  As long as you do that and kill her, it's okay.
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  Not according to me, according to them.
[36:28.000 --> 36:29.960]  I mean, that's where this goes.
[36:29.960 --> 36:32.240]  It's all about form over function.
[36:32.240 --> 36:36.800]  It's all about propaganda over reality.
[36:36.800 --> 36:45.440]  Now, let's get to some of these clips I promised I was going to go to.
[36:45.440 --> 36:48.080]  We've got so much more in the next segment.
[36:48.080 --> 36:54.080]  Let's start with White House changes public voice mail say dims holding government hostage,
[36:54.080 --> 36:59.120]  which it was a minority of Democrat senators that held it hostage saying total legalization
[36:59.120 --> 37:06.640]  of illegals, fifth cousins, you name it can come in, or it's the end of the country.
[37:06.640 --> 37:12.640]  Or we will hold up payment to the Postal Service and federal employees and the military
[37:12.640 --> 37:13.880]  and everything else.
[37:13.880 --> 37:17.240]  So the president and the White House which board tells the truth.
[37:17.240 --> 37:18.240]  Here it is.
[37:18.240 --> 37:21.400]  Thank you for calling the White House comment line.
[37:21.400 --> 37:24.320]  Thank you for calling the White House.
[37:24.320 --> 37:28.920]  Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding
[37:28.920 --> 37:34.440]  government funding, including funding for our troops and other national security priorities
[37:34.440 --> 37:39.040]  hostage to an unrelated immigration debate due to this obstruction.
[37:39.040 --> 37:42.440]  The government is shut down in the meantime.
[37:42.440 --> 37:50.640]  You can leave a comment for the president at www.whitehouse.gov forward slash contact.
[37:50.640 --> 37:56.560]  We look forward to taking your calls as soon as the government reopens.
[37:56.560 --> 37:59.160]  I'm going to give you the big secret of Trump.
[37:59.160 --> 38:04.640]  If he doesn't deliver on the recovery for America, his name is crap.
[38:04.640 --> 38:09.360]  Just like the doctor that helped John Wilkes Booth kill Lincoln.
[38:09.360 --> 38:11.400]  His last name is now known as mud.
[38:11.400 --> 38:12.400]  Your name is mud.
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.200]  And his great, great, great, great grandson is on TV saying kill the president, former
[38:16.200 --> 38:17.360]  deputy C.I. director.
[38:17.360 --> 38:18.600]  You can't make this up.
[38:18.600 --> 38:19.680]  Three strings of the fiction.
[38:19.680 --> 38:20.680]  His name is mud.
[38:20.680 --> 38:22.880]  His name is crap.
[38:22.880 --> 38:28.240]  Trump wants that name to still be like in cards, the name, the Trump.
[38:28.240 --> 38:34.640]  And I guess interdimensionally, culturally, people understand it's the Trump.
[38:34.640 --> 38:36.160]  It's the Trump card.
[38:36.160 --> 38:41.080]  When they got off the boat, you know, his, his, his dad's parents got off the boat.
[38:41.080 --> 38:44.640]  The name was a longer German name that had Trump in the front of it.
[38:44.640 --> 38:45.640]  They cut it to Trump.
[38:45.640 --> 38:50.040]  But in, in cultural parlance, it's now ace of spades.
[38:50.040 --> 38:51.040]  You're trumped.
[38:51.040 --> 38:52.040]  Royal flush.
[38:52.040 --> 38:53.040]  You're trumped.
[38:53.040 --> 38:54.040]  So Trump gets that.
[38:54.040 --> 38:58.080]  If he can turn things around from his own selfishness, if you think that his family,
[38:58.080 --> 39:00.440]  his name is platinum gold.
[39:00.440 --> 39:01.440]  Okay.
[39:01.440 --> 39:03.840]  If he doesn't, he fails.
[39:03.840 --> 39:09.840]  He's metaphysically joined to this battle and he, and believe me, he knows it.
[39:09.840 --> 39:14.960]  And so that's why they're freaking out so bad and he's simply trying to deliver.
[39:14.960 --> 39:20.560]  And so when you get this straight shooting from the president, it's just the Democrats
[39:20.560 --> 39:22.400]  are saying, we shut it down.
[39:22.400 --> 39:25.520]  Republicans before wouldn't run a thing like that, but it's true.
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.480]  So they're just going to be honest with you.
[39:29.480 --> 39:32.320]  I thought the Pentagon five years ago when they said, we're going to stop lying.
[39:32.320 --> 39:33.320]  We've been wrong.
[39:33.320 --> 39:35.040]  We're turning against Obama and the government.
[39:35.040 --> 39:36.640]  I thought this is a giant.
[39:36.640 --> 39:40.360]  Remember the whole headline I put out Pentagon admits they're going to stop lying because
[39:40.360 --> 39:41.360]  of drudge.
[39:41.360 --> 39:42.720]  You can pull that up.
[39:42.720 --> 39:48.360]  And I was at four or five years ago and I, I, I didn't believe it, but actually they
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.680]  got that they had hooked onto this Chinese communist program and this whole thing.
[39:53.680 --> 39:54.920]  And then it was destroying everybody.
[39:54.920 --> 39:56.480]  They said, we're going to stop lying.
[39:56.480 --> 39:57.640]  We're going to recruit candidates.
[39:57.640 --> 39:58.640]  Don't lie.
[39:58.640 --> 40:01.240]  And the military is going to be involved locally in your government is trying to reboot America.
[40:01.240 --> 40:03.440]  I thought, look at this cynical BS.
[40:03.440 --> 40:07.240]  And then I saw it actually happen, but it wasn't out of some altruistic thing.
[40:07.240 --> 40:08.640]  It was out of pure survival.
[40:08.640 --> 40:13.440]  Now there it is 2013, hardly that's five years ago.
[40:13.440 --> 40:14.440]  Wow.
[40:14.440 --> 40:16.640]  Government promises to stop lying because of drudge report spotlight.
[40:16.640 --> 40:17.840]  Go watch that video.
[40:17.840 --> 40:24.880]  If you want to understand everything, man, we could have a whole hour long show every
[40:24.880 --> 40:25.880]  day.
[40:25.880 --> 40:30.680]  Just the things we predicted and showed that it's amazing.
[40:30.680 --> 40:34.160]  But here's Democrat Senator who voted to shut down government says government should
[40:34.160 --> 40:36.800]  be shut down, shouldn't be shut down.
[40:36.800 --> 40:41.600]  And he's on Fox news thinking they won't go, but you voted to shut it down.
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.320]  You're the one that did it, but you think the constituents are dumb and you saying you
[40:45.320 --> 40:46.320]  didn't again.
[40:46.320 --> 40:49.720]  I mean, can you imagine going through life lying like this?
[40:49.720 --> 40:52.240]  Good God, just straight shoot, man.
[40:52.240 --> 40:58.920]  That's where the power is and we're rediscovering that America is about straight shooting.
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.240]  Even we say we're coming to kill you.
[41:00.240 --> 41:05.440]  We just told you from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
[41:05.440 --> 41:08.520]  Let's go ahead now and go to that club here at us.
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.600]  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator, are you willing to see
[41:12.600 --> 41:15.840]  that and other vital programs shut down?
[41:15.840 --> 41:17.360]  The government should not be shut down.
[41:17.360 --> 41:21.600]  That's why I spent all day yesterday listening to working with Republicans.
[41:21.600 --> 41:22.760]  You voted to shut it down.
[41:22.760 --> 41:24.200]  You voted against the CR.
[41:24.200 --> 41:29.000]  I voted against a 30 day CR and to be clear on Friday, an assistant to that Secretary
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.000]  of Defense, Secretary Mattis.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  Stop right there.
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  That's another is crap.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  And he tried that slick one didn't work.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  These people never end.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.240]  All right, there's another complicit.
[41:39.240 --> 41:44.080]  Trump campaign slams Democrats is complicit in murders by illegal immigrants and explosive
[41:44.080 --> 41:45.080]  new add.
[41:45.080 --> 41:46.080]  Here it is.
[41:46.080 --> 41:51.520]  That's illegal immigrant Luis Bracca Montez charged with murdering
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.480]  two police officers.
[41:55.480 --> 41:57.840]  It's pure evil.
[41:57.840 --> 41:59.280]  President Trump is right.
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.160]  Build the wall, deport criminals, stop illegal immigration now.
[42:04.160 --> 42:09.360]  Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.
[42:09.360 --> 42:13.000]  President Trump will fix our border and keep our families safe.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.800]  I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message.
[42:15.800 --> 42:19.480]  The wall like in China is a symbol of sovereignty.
[42:19.480 --> 42:22.920]  And it allows criminals to run back and forth across the border.
[42:22.920 --> 42:26.200]  50 years ago, Mexico used to bet that we sent our criminals there.
[42:26.200 --> 42:27.800]  It was true.
[42:27.800 --> 42:30.320]  Mexico has the highest murder rate in the world.
[42:30.320 --> 42:33.920]  And now people are running back and forth across it, but you can't go to Mexico and
[42:33.920 --> 42:35.280]  stay if you don't want to.
[42:35.280 --> 42:39.000]  So again, it's reality setting in on the other side.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the big news China that our media defends, but the Trump exposes
[42:45.600 --> 42:50.880]  bans Christianity nationwide.
[42:50.880 --> 42:53.480]  But the good news is here.
[42:53.480 --> 42:56.560]  Science is revolutionizing arguments against abortion.
[42:56.560 --> 42:59.400]  Stay with us and spread the links.
[42:59.400 --> 43:05.840]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by Info Wars Life for those who want

[44:03.840 --> 44:06.280]  But instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced
[44:06.280 --> 44:07.280]  personally.
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.600]  From all the wives, tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[44:11.600 --> 44:14.880]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[44:14.880 --> 44:19.960]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[44:19.960 --> 44:25.360]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and
[44:25.360 --> 44:32.880]  the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.

[44:41.080 --> 44:48.920]  gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[44:54.800 --> 44:58.440]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[44:58.440 --> 45:05.640]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still
[45:05.640 --> 45:08.640]  maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[45:08.640 --> 45:09.640]  That's right.
[45:09.640 --> 45:14.320]  It's time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's Freeze Dryers.
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.520]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology
[45:19.520 --> 45:20.520]  that's easy to use.
[45:20.520 --> 45:21.800]  And let me tell you something.
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.360]  It is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire
[45:27.360 --> 45:28.360]  meals.
[45:28.360 --> 45:29.360]  Woo!
[45:29.360 --> 45:30.360]  That's what I'm talking about.
[45:30.360 --> 45:34.840]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[45:34.840 --> 45:38.840]  you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[45:38.840 --> 45:44.720]  Harvest Right Freeze Dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[45:44.720 --> 45:48.200]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[45:48.200 --> 45:51.600]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.760]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[45:55.760 --> 45:56.760]  So what are you waiting for?
[45:56.760 --> 45:59.920]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[45:59.920 --> 46:05.200]  Introducing Floor Life, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowars Life.
[46:05.200 --> 46:09.880]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[46:09.880 --> 46:14.520]  Floor Life probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[46:14.520 --> 46:18.640]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[46:18.640 --> 46:23.120]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[46:23.120 --> 46:27.480]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.200]  Floor Life supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[46:32.200 --> 46:34.640]  immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[46:34.640 --> 46:38.680]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[46:38.680 --> 46:43.360]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[46:43.360 --> 46:48.000]  Floor Life is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.360]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.600]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floor Life probiotics today.
[46:55.600 --> 47:03.400]  That's infowarslife.com.
[47:03.400 --> 47:10.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:33.400 --> 47:57.400]  We're going to ride, we're going to ride, ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with
[47:57.400 --> 48:07.400]  a devil close behind, one-eyed jack of Odin, one eye in the heavens, one eye on earth,
[48:07.400 --> 48:08.400]  all that metaphysical.
[48:08.400 --> 48:13.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's get into the big news here today on the Sunday
[48:13.400 --> 48:14.400]  Transmission.
[48:14.400 --> 48:17.400]  I'm going to chase the sky.
[48:17.400 --> 48:20.960]  Let's get into it right now.
[48:20.960 --> 48:21.960]  People are people.
[48:21.960 --> 48:25.480]  No matter what color or skin color is, there's good people, there's bad people, there's
[48:25.480 --> 48:30.080]  folks from good families and bad families, and sometimes you get good people out of bad
[48:30.080 --> 48:31.880]  families, but that's rare.
[48:31.880 --> 48:36.920]  You usually get good people out of good families, and you get some bad people as well, but that's
[48:36.920 --> 48:37.920]  rare as well.
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.680]  That's just the way it works, everybody knows it.
[48:41.680 --> 48:45.040]  You go out with some girl or some guy, and you go meet their family or a bunch of scam
[48:45.040 --> 48:50.280]  artists, a bunch of trash, you know, they're bad people.
[48:50.280 --> 48:53.480]  And I've got some really important news I want to head about the attacks on Christians
[48:53.480 --> 49:00.240]  in China and folks that are fighting back against that at the moment, but first off,
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.560]  I wanted to just get to a video that's on infowars.com that's got so much cussing on
[49:04.560 --> 49:07.000]  it, I can't play it.
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  There's dozens of videos shot in LA and shot in New York by crews.
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.520]  I sent both places to cover the women's marches, and Milly Weaver and Gavin Wentz were out
[49:16.520 --> 49:23.240]  there and they went out to these crowds of Trump supporters and a good 20, 30% were Hispanic,
[49:23.240 --> 49:29.200]  but the police would come get them and separately say, you got to go to another area because
[49:29.200 --> 49:34.080]  you are just you being Hispanic and wearing an American flag.
[49:34.080 --> 49:40.760]  You are in danger and you're invoking a problem, kind of like the Ninth Circuit rule four
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.040]  years ago, five years ago, you can't wear a American flag at school.
[49:45.040 --> 49:47.480]  That's gang paraphernalia, but you can wear a Mexican flag.
[49:47.480 --> 49:52.080]  So this has a left who claims they're tolerant that they don't want to wall the north or
[49:52.080 --> 49:59.160]  south border, but they want walls up in D.C. or New York or LA, which we have videos of
[49:59.160 --> 50:08.040]  on infowars, left sets up walls blocking people going to a theater to hear Owen Shroyer and
[50:08.040 --> 50:16.000]  Mike Cernovich and James O'Keefe and a bunch of other speed and you're like, well, we
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  want to go in.
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.040]  No, we're blocking you just like I spent three hours trying to get into Trump's inauguration
[50:22.040 --> 50:27.200]  and I would fight through the crowds and the police would say, sorry, because Black Lives
[50:27.200 --> 50:30.440]  Matter is blocking this or anti-fayers were not letting you in.
[50:30.440 --> 50:31.440]  They were part of it.
[50:31.440 --> 50:32.880]  And it came out in the news.
[50:32.880 --> 50:39.800]  The Democrat run city of D.C. I watched the left beat up women.
[50:39.800 --> 50:41.680]  So we'd go over and run them over.
[50:41.680 --> 50:42.680]  We wouldn't hit them.
[50:42.680 --> 50:43.680]  We'd knock them down.
[50:43.680 --> 50:49.320]  And I guess I could say I had more courage than usual because I had a couple of Navy
[50:49.320 --> 50:54.400]  Sills with me and Army operators and Delta Force and all the rest of the retired folks
[50:54.400 --> 50:55.400]  there.
[50:55.400 --> 50:56.400]  We were knocking them down.
[50:56.400 --> 51:01.440]  We'd knock down 20 deep people, just video, knock them over, didn't matter.
[51:01.440 --> 51:05.760]  Cops would say, you're not going into this, they turn around or I'm going to arrest you.
[51:05.760 --> 51:08.040]  The cops would grab us and we didn't resist them.
[51:08.040 --> 51:10.440]  They did have like some seven foot tall cops, man.
[51:10.440 --> 51:12.080]  Didn't know there was that many big Irishmen.
[51:12.080 --> 51:13.920]  There's a big ass white cops.
[51:13.920 --> 51:20.960]  They'd drag us out of there and say, you're not going in here.
[51:20.960 --> 51:24.840]  A part of ours, by the way, I'm not knocking them, but there were gigantic Irish cops.
[51:24.840 --> 51:28.880]  These guys were so big or NBA players and we're just like, we're going to fight cops
[51:28.880 --> 51:29.880]  to go in this.
[51:29.880 --> 51:33.640]  And then we got to see the news say, look, nobody's there to see Trump at 10 o'clock
[51:33.640 --> 51:36.680]  in the morning when they first opened the gates because nobody could get in.
[51:36.680 --> 51:37.680]  They said nobody was there.
[51:37.680 --> 51:43.360]  Again, lies, lies, lies, frustrating my free speech, pissing on me and my family.
[51:43.360 --> 51:49.800]  And I'm tired of it because it's one thing if I got to run through 15 deep black lives
[51:49.800 --> 51:52.920]  matter in Antifa, all their punchiness and stuff.
[51:52.920 --> 51:56.600]  We just ran them over and the cops are like, you're not going in.
[51:56.600 --> 51:57.760]  They blocked this entrance.
[51:57.760 --> 52:03.080]  But when I went to the VIP entrance and every attention I had the VIP ticket, there was
[52:03.080 --> 52:08.240]  nobody there because Antifa had coordinated with the DC police and we even have the documents.
[52:08.240 --> 52:10.800]  They didn't mess with everybody going in the VIP entrance.
[52:10.800 --> 52:13.160]  I didn't even think of that was way up north.
[52:13.160 --> 52:17.040]  I was just trying to my hotel down the South trying to get in, but see, I tried to get
[52:17.040 --> 52:19.600]  in where the normal people get in.
[52:19.600 --> 52:24.200]  See, that's who they were beating up and keeping from going in and just instinctively, I went
[52:24.200 --> 52:26.680]  to the blue collar entrance, the nearest entrance.
[52:26.680 --> 52:30.320]  I didn't like an elitist go, well, I'm going to the elitist's entrance.
[52:30.320 --> 52:35.160]  That's where all, but sure enough, everything was peaches and cream.
[52:35.160 --> 52:38.520]  God, you talk about a class system.
[52:38.520 --> 52:42.680]  This makes me sick.
[52:42.680 --> 52:46.920]  I don't care if you're black, white, Hispanic, who you are, you want to go see the inauguration,
[52:46.920 --> 52:51.480]  you should go see it.
[52:51.480 --> 52:56.040]  And I got a bunch of clips to get to.
[52:56.040 --> 52:57.040]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[52:57.040 --> 52:58.040]  It was just a one minute clip.
[52:58.040 --> 53:02.560]  There's not cussing from the powerful Melly Weaver interview on info wars.com that deserves
[53:02.560 --> 53:05.000]  to be seen, but it will only be seen if you get it out.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  Here it is.
[53:06.000 --> 53:11.280]  These people that accuse us of being racist, all because I say I'm an American and I support
[53:11.280 --> 53:12.280]  my president.
[53:12.280 --> 53:14.280]  They are actually the ones that call me a biner.
[53:14.280 --> 53:18.560]  They are actually the ones that call me a senna.
[53:18.560 --> 53:26.080]  They call me Indian, an Indian, which is a derogatory term for indigenous people.
[53:26.080 --> 53:30.920]  So that's what they try to categorize me as just because I support America, because I
[53:30.920 --> 53:36.280]  am an American, I support my president, and that's totally wrong from people that accuse
[53:36.280 --> 53:39.000]  us of being racist when they themselves are racist.
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  Yeah, so it's bad, it's bad, but I don't go back with their racial slurs.
[53:45.000 --> 53:51.320]  I always stay to the issue and yell out the facts and the truth, and unfortunately, they
[53:51.320 --> 53:53.320]  just can't get it.
[53:53.320 --> 53:58.680]  They lost, they're crying about it, they're throwing a tantrum, and it's sad.
[53:58.680 --> 54:00.920]  You see the key there?
[54:00.920 --> 54:05.400]  You said they call me Indian, Indio, because there's racism all over the world.
[54:05.400 --> 54:10.920]  You go to China, it's the most homogenic, racist group in the world, even more than Japan,
[54:10.920 --> 54:12.680]  and I'm not blaming them on their own country.
[54:12.680 --> 54:15.680]  They don't let one Muslim into Japan.
[54:15.680 --> 54:21.720]  China, if you got money like Switzerland, you're not even getting in.
[54:21.720 --> 54:28.360]  But the point is they call him an Indian, because in Mexico, that's the lower class,
[54:28.360 --> 54:30.400]  the lighter your skin is, the more elite you are.
[54:30.400 --> 54:38.080]  You look at the Mexican Congress, those people are wider than I am.
[54:38.080 --> 54:41.560]  And that's what's so sick about all this class crap, and the globalists know how to manipulate
[54:41.560 --> 54:45.080]  it, and that's what makes me sick.
[54:45.080 --> 54:47.800]  Now let's look at some big news here before I end this hour and come back with even more
[54:47.800 --> 54:48.800]  news.
[54:48.800 --> 54:55.560]  Macron, who was the leftist savior, admits France would vote to leave the EU if referendum
[54:55.560 --> 54:56.640]  was held.
[54:56.640 --> 55:02.760]  And that's why this is so big, is that Germany is losing control, all the EU countries are
[55:02.760 --> 55:11.680]  losing control, the globalists are in trouble, people are shutting it down, German cities
[55:11.680 --> 55:16.160]  are voting to not take any more, quote, migrants that are military aged men.
[55:16.160 --> 55:22.600]  There was an attempted 21st century coup over Europe to bring in, they brought in 10 million
[55:22.600 --> 55:27.240]  Muslims in five years, they want 20 million in the next five.
[55:27.240 --> 55:31.160]  And then you look at the photos, I tweeted out on real life shows, it's like people
[55:31.160 --> 55:35.600]  crapping in the street, people cooking chickens on the side of the road, and I'm not even
[55:35.600 --> 55:39.360]  bashing that, you don't build a high tech civilization and then bring in a bunch of
[55:39.360 --> 55:43.960]  people that don't even have housing, it's meant to sabotage things.
[55:43.960 --> 55:48.200]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip of the French president here it is.
[55:48.200 --> 55:52.840]  Yes or no in a very complicated context, if France had a referendum, it might have had
[55:52.840 --> 56:00.040]  the same result, yeah, probably, probably, in a similar context, but our context was
[56:00.040 --> 56:12.080]  very different, so I don't want to make any, I mean to take any bet, but I would have definitely
[56:12.080 --> 56:20.440]  found very hard to win, but I think it's a mistake when you just ask yes or no, when
[56:20.440 --> 56:25.800]  you don't ask people how to improve the situation and to explain how to improve it.
[56:25.800 --> 56:29.560]  Okay, and then I can't find it in my stack of articles, there were like 300 articles
[56:29.560 --> 56:35.480]  here, but I've got articles, we're in Sweden, there are bomb attacks daily on the police
[56:35.480 --> 56:42.040]  stations, rapes, murders everywhere, and they brought in the failed ISIS fighters out
[56:42.040 --> 56:46.920]  of Syria and said come there and they give them free housing and they're just killing
[56:46.920 --> 56:47.920]  everybody.
[56:47.920 --> 56:51.680]  I mean that's in my stack, I haven't even gotten to that yet, it's just like you asked
[56:51.680 --> 56:56.800]  yourself what planet is this, so it gets crazier and crazier, second hour, I haven't gotten

[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.680]  What can you learn by ambulating through the seething crowds of estrogen at the annual
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:43.920]  women's march in Austin, Texas, well apparently men are evil misogynistic scum, this is women
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:02:00.480]  hating their own species being taught to die, all men were women, this is insane about this,
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:18.240]  your mother decides your sex, and notice how these women that want to lead women don't
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.760]  look like women, white men need to be reconditioned to accept their white guilt and submit to
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:44.600]  Marxist feminism, and the numbers are way down this year in Austin, Texas, and the numbers
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:54.840]  are way down this year in Austin, Texas, I think it's got a little bit of a different
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:01.160]  vibe this year, I think well right now we're mostly towards like the Roe v. Wade section
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.400]  of the day, so it's kind of a little bit different than what the women's march is, I think we've
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.840]  had a good turnout, it's not as big as anybody would like to have one like we had last year,
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:17.040]  but that's, that was a unique situation, so you could walk around, why do you think that
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040]  is?
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.680]  How about women having to do forced abortions in China, they're not going to say a damn
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:28.240]  thing, you virtue signaling pieces of crap to your bankroll by those people, were people
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:36.200]  angrier at Trump last year, look at these dumbasses, they take the strength of America's
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:58.080]  way to piss on it, that veils going to be gone soon sister.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.880]  But the main threat to the feminist agenda was abundantly clear, President Trump became
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:08.800]  the first sitting president to address the 45th annual pro-life march for life.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:14.920]  The march for life is a movement born out of love, you love your families, you love
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:21.960]  your neighbors, you love our nation, and you love every child born and unborn because you
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:29.440]  believe that every life is sacred, that every child is a precious gift from God.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:58.400]  That's right, humans are crap.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:15.800]  This is
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.900]  caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:38.960]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.780]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.520]  species and other free radicals.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.500]  Boost, protect and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:59.160]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:27.520]  All right, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.360]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, Roger Stonneson joins us with a huge breaking news.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:37.320]  I'm Alex Schoens, your host, newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, and I mentioned
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.400]  this in the last hour, but I couldn't find the stack.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:45.560]  I did find the stack, so I'm going to hit this now, then get into China, cracks down
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:53.280]  on Christianity, demolishes evangelical church, and science is revolutionizing arguments
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280]  against abortion.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:04.960]  That's all coming up, but first, major state to register illegal aliens to vote automatically.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.400]  This is a WorldNetDaily.com article, but it links to the California New Law, where
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.400]  they're now saying we're going to register illegals to vote.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.440]  If you have a driver's license, you can vote.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:22.280]  So they say Trump's crazy, they say it's not happening, blah, blah, blah, nobody wants
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.960]  your guns, but their official platform is to take your guns to the UN and Uniteer.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.960]  There it is.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:37.440]  Meanwhile, teens roam the streets with rifles, this is out of the times of the UK, as crime
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:43.080]  swamp Sweden, and it describes the daily bombings of police stations.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:47.360]  As the bomb went off and blew the police station up, they thought, is it another attack?
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.600]  Yes, it was.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:53.320]  Shootings, killings, they brought in over a million military policemen into Sweden, and
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.560]  just the last four and a half years, they're raping, they're killing, they're slaughtering,
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:04.560]  and the government just says, submit, submit, submit, because this is the globalist operation.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:10.600]  It's not for the Muslims either, it's just a program to bring down open societies and
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.400]  use our strength against us.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.560]  So read that article.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:20.880]  German city bans new refugees as anti-migrant increases.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.840]  We're not taking women and children out of the Middle East that could be assimilated and
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.160]  not reeducated, but at least shown that, no, you bring in the Muslims, you let in 80%
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:36.800]  of them are men, you put them in charge, and then German television, Dutch television, Swedish
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:43.040]  television, we showed it last week, says, where the jib, join Islam, children.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.480]  This is what's happening.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.280]  German city bans new refugees as anti-migrant mood increases.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:54.480]  There's that report, up on infowars.com, a little on a telegraph.
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.480]  Here's another one.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.840]  Video, the future of Europe is the caliphate, unless the citizens rise and defend the culture,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.680]  voice of Europe, and you've got all the Islamic leaders saying, we're taking you over, you're
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:13.600]  done, and you've got Turkey saying, we've got 20 million Turks inside Europe.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.040]  We're going to burn everything down.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:24.400]  That's a quote from last year, unless you submit, I mean, it's just insanity.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.400]  Because here's the truth.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.040]  We need hybrid vigor.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.200]  If you just inbreed, whether you're a Middle Eastern or whether you're a European or whether
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.280]  you're a Latin American or whether you're an Asian, China has incredible birth defects
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:42.800]  because they have the closest genetics of any group in the world.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.320]  One reason Hitler came to power, he was a bad guy, but like there was like 10% of Germans
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.320]  were deformed.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.920]  Well, they were all living in the same towns, having sex with each other.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.680]  And that's why the Hitler said, well, let's bring Muslims in, you know, they're right
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.160]  here looking for them, they'll bring some genetics.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.040]  You do need hybrid vigor.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.600]  You don't want to be a purebred dog.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.720]  Everybody knows purebred dogs are mentally ill.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.720]  They're crazy.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:09.200]  They bite you and they got problems, but this isn't doing that for genetics.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.200]  This is coming in and saying, we're going to submit to the screwed up inbred culture
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.840]  when nobody has got more screwed up genes than North Africans and Middle Eastern.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:26.520]  I mean, they have the highest rates of birth defects in the world.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:34.040]  They are the most inbred people because of all the Islamic, Marrior cousin stuff.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.080]  Pakistanis are half of 1% in England.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.720]  They're 35%, 36% of birth defects.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.280]  I mean, well, nothing against Pakistanis, a lot of them have super IQs.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.120]  Those are the ones that can function, but they all look just the same cause it's the
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  same dude.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.240]  I mean, you know, it's a clone.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.640]  You start marrying your sister and down the road, I mean, it's the same dude and genetic
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:07.040]  problems are magnified, are magnified in mental illness and the willingness to be aggressive
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.160]  and kill people.
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.440]  That's your problem right there.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:20.080]  British Royals, Queen Elizabeth, what had five siblings, all but one are in mental institutions
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.080]  or have died.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:27.840]  I mean, they're like right on the wall with their crap because they're all inbred, man.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.360]  You go look at Egyptian mummies and they go, oh, it must be a space alien, its head looks
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:37.840]  like a cantaloupe or looks like a egg plant.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.480]  No, that's 10 generations of inbreeding.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.080]  It doesn't work.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.080]  It's bad.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:51.560]  I already mentioned Macron and Midge, France would vote to leave EU of referendum held,
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:56.480]  right wing Italian favorite blast, the EU can eff his shelf.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.160]  Italian populist candidate, EU again.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:04.160]  So it just goes on from there and look, look, I don't virtue signal with this, but I mean,
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:10.120]  I've got Native American in one area of my mom's side, very small area, my dad's quite
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:17.040]  a bit, but it's known that that genetically boost my intelligence, boost my vigor, boost
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:23.600]  my genetic prowess for pollinating females, everything else.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:29.840]  You had a little bit of those genes to my genes and it soups me up.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.360]  So again, I'm not against brown people.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:38.440]  The point is I'm against inbred cultures being brought in to be shut up because they're
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.920]  politically servile and dependent on welfare to be controlled.
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.920]  That is what I'm against.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920]  That is what I'm against.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:53.640]  All right, let's continue ladies and gentlemen, let's get to the really big news and I don't
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.240]  hold this off on purpose because I should have opened the show with, but I'm going to
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:57.240]  do it the next segment.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240]  So I have time.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.280]  I'm going to come back directly with this when we come back in the next segment.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.520]  China cracks down on Christianity demolishes evangelical church.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:12.600]  Meanwhile, science is revolutionizing arguments against abortion, Planned Parenthood condemns
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:19.280]  house passions of bill to ensure babies born alive aren't harvested.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:23.320]  So we're going to cover that when we come back on the other side briefly because the
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.920]  crew is right to do this.
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:32.200]  We're not going to exist at its info wars unless you continue to pray for us and spread
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.000]  the articles, spread the videos, and tell neighbors and friends and everybody else on
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  your email.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  You name it that.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Hey, this is an important show.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.480]  You ought to tune in every time we're live.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.480]  You do that.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.640]  It breaks the algorithm.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:45.200]  It breaks the computers.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.360]  It breaks the AI.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:52.760]  It breaks the will of the Zuckerbergs and the Bezos and the smits at Google that think
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:53.800]  they can stop you.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:14:05.360]  You taking action is unstoppable and that said we need your financial support, but plus
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:12.320]  we have produced the cleanest, purest iodine from our research that is out there, X2.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.280]  And what it does to block the other bad halogens in the garbage is incredible.
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:22.960]  It's 40% off right now with secret 12, which again, even BuzzFeed tested it and said, okay,
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.600]  it's the purest bottom and be 12 out on the market.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.960]  I couldn't believe they were actually honest.
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.840]  I mean, they said, oh, look, this is the purest in the country.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.840]  And here's Jones's.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.560]  They didn't know we were private labeling the purest in the country and then discounting
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560]  it 30%.

[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:38.200]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly

[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.960]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:15.320]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:20.640]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:27.040]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.160]  This coffee gives you a long smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.320]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.600]  It's down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.760]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.000]  I don't think you're going to be disappointed available in original or with our immune support
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.040]  infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.640]  tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:04.000]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.360]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:17.600]  or videos or other material from InfowarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:22.520]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear, and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.520]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.200]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.360]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:37.280]  children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, the colloidal
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.920]  silver and iodine as well, InfowarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139, and your purchase of the
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.760]  products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.480]  and their satanic pedophile armies, and that's who they are, and they know we know who they
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:20:02.000]  are, and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:12.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:18.920]  I have sworn the ultimate of God, resistance.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:31.720]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones, a darkest hour, but I realized
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:38.320]  they had a posthuman future for us, they turned us all against each other, and I could only
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:46.320]  fight the cultural racism by engaging in it, but only to get their attention, to see the
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:55.400]  whole plan laid out, and I had a plan to stop it, but only if you look inside yourself and
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:01.000]  realize the truth of it, Roger Stone is going to host the last two segments because you
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.280]  got so much important stuff to say, I'll tend to interrupt, so just occasionally I'd let
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.000]  folks co-host the show and take over, we're going to go to Roger here in just a minute,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.520]  but let me get these two stories first that I have been mentioning but I haven't gotten
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.960]  to.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:23.360]  Science is revolutionizing arguments against abortion, that's a daily caller article,
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:34.920]  but we know that the average baby, aborted after the second trimester, is sold for over
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:41.400]  $100,000, now think about that, you go pay to have your baby aborted $300, but you're
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:47.040]  not being told that this turkey, this thing is crap, see I'm bad to call it crap, I don't
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.240]  believe it's crap, but this piece of crap, this little bastard, he deserves to die scumbag
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:57.600]  filth, this ugly son of a bitch up, they didn't tell you, you get paid a lot of money for
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:06.160]  that, they didn't tell you that there were hundreds of adoption centers that would pay
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:16.640]  you between $50,000 and $400,000.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:23.200]  There is a racism, $50,000 for a black baby, I guess $300,000 is the high for black hair
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.040]  blue eyes or green eyes, I get $300,000, I mean these are known, I've had experts on
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:33.000]  about it, the point is they say, oh nobody wants these black babies, BS, I know so many
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.560]  white folks you name it, Hispanics, blacks that have six, seven, eight adopted black
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.280]  babies, they love them, they're good people, they grew up being members of society, but
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:47.320]  the racism is the black babies are $50,000 if you don't abort them, the white babies
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:55.080]  are 100, the blonde-haired blue-eyed babies are maybe 150, but the black-haired blue-eyed
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:23:00.800]  or green-eyed 300,000 and more, that's what the elite are really looking for, but let's
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:07.000]  just move past that, they don't tell you when you come in to have that baby, there's hundreds
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.360]  of charities, Christian charities, Catholic charities, you name it, we're ready to pay
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:17.400]  for that baby, you go in and you pay, so the way to defeat abortion, because there's more
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.920]  people wanting to adopt every year than there are abortions in the US, look it up, my family
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:29.840]  adopted my sister from Korea, from a starving orphanage, David Nod adopted his daughter
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.400]  from China, even though he already had two sons, went there she was starving to death,
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:40.040]  maybe 40% under what she should have weighed, they was telling me this day, she gets food
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.640]  and goes off and eats it or whatever, but that's what she went there and we were super
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:50.600]  happy to adopt a Korean baby, it didn't matter to us, the whole point was is that there is
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:59.360]  a price on this flesh, but the medical experiments on average $100,000 per baby that's in the
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:07.080]  third trimester, so I just tell women, you can sell that meat, but let's just say it's
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:15.080]  crap, it's, I agree with the leftist, it's crap, filth, filth, why don't you at least
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:21.400]  get some money for that dead baby, for that dead scum, you call it scum, Gloria Steinem
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:26.320]  says I'm proud of it, let's call it filth, that filthy baby deserves to die, that is
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:32.560]  we thought a human F that baby, ah yeah let's go that way, I agree with you, it's liberal,
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.480]  you just cut yourself out of an investment, why'd you pay $2,000 for a partial birth abortion
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.760]  or 300 bucks for that second term, why'd you do that, why'd you get some good cash off
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:52.800]  killing your baby, get some cash, but see the cash is for keeping it alive, the cash
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:25:00.280]  is off that, see, they're gonna sell your baby, they're gonna grind it up, baby, baby
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:07.040]  is pure DNA, it's pure life force, and so they can grow tissue, that tissue grows in
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.080]  these vats they've got, and then they grind it up to vaccines, cosmetics, you name it,
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:19.040]  I just think women ought to know there's a market in your babies, more money to keep
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.400]  them alive, but you want to kill them, that's liberal, it's kind of a cool feminist thing
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.080]  to do, I guess it's a little Satanism, little demon comes to you with a little bit of power,
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:31.080]  I get it, kill them, kill them all you want, murder them, tell, watch video, I'm chopping
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.880]  them up as babies, even four month old fight with their arms hard, screw them, we got victory
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:42.320]  over those babies, let's chop their asses up and get off on it, I like it, but I think
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.720]  you ought to get some cash when you kill your baby, when you slice his throat and cut its
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:53.840]  head off, get some money, I'm a Satanist, I'm a liberal, I want to eff everybody over,
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:58.320]  so all the liberal women, there's a market in killing your babies and selling their
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:06.560]  slop, they are slop aren't they, eff them, I agree with you, I agree, I love Satan, make
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.520]  money off your babies, don't just give it to these dudes, real Satanists will make money
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.520]  off killing their own baby, make some money you dumb bitches, all right we're going to
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.240]  break and come back with Roger Stone, I'm going to turn it over to him, he's got huge breaking
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:25.000]  news, but look at this filthy article, science is turning people against abortion, knowing
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.320]  the baby sucks his thumb is alive, just kill it and be liberal, and then of course Planned
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:34.840]  Parenthood condemns House passage of bill to ensure babies born alive, because they keep
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.840]  them alive to harvest their organs, I just say hang them up other feet and pass a law,
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.960]  you electroshock torture them, I'm sure Weinstein would like that, and then another one China
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:50.480]  cracks down on Christianity demolishes evangelical church, German news and China churches are
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.840]  being demolished and new laws are set to increase modern religious activities or put them in
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.320]  camps and taking their organs, well just like babies, take those Buddhists and those Christians
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:03.960]  and take them into a facility and work them in slave labor and cut their guts out and
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:08.560]  put it in some trendy liberal, I agree with it, I'm liberal, I'm all about diversity,
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.440]  I say murder everybody and just chop their organs out, just give it to liberals, because
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.920]  they're our God and they taught us to be immoral and they rule everything, so there's your
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.760]  stories right there, under stone, good to have you, whether you're about to host the
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.720]  next two segments, you've got big breaking news, you first said six months ago, or four
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:32.600]  or five months ago, that Zucker would be out, and CNN, you've been reporting that correctly,
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:38.320]  so please take it over, thank you Alex, you know the one thing that gives me heart after
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:44.080]  heart, your soliloquy there is that President Trump is a total solidarity with the life
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:50.480]  movement and unlike previous Republican presidents who gave it lip service, he was there and
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:56.240]  he was strong and we were strong, I'm one of those Republicans who's gone full cycle,
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.880]  yes, there was a time that I was pro-choice because I didn't like the idea of the government
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.160]  telling anybody what they could do with their body, now I realize how wrong that was and
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:11.760]  I realize we have a president who stands tall for life, how refreshing, how different, a
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.040]  guy who runs for president and actually does what he says, I was about to say none of us
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.160]  judge people that have abortions, we're not saying you're evil if you did it, the thing
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.960]  above it is evil, it's the harvesting of children and Trump's the first Republican
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:29.280]  to actually go to the march, he did what he said again, Roger, it's astounding, it really
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:36.160]  is and he's making America great and boy it is driving the libtards crazy, driving them crazy,
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.640]  you're at the Alex Jones show and I'll be right back, we're going to talk about the
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:47.040]  special US vaccination court and the latest cover-up that we have determined is underway
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.840]  right here at InfoWars, we'll be right back. That's right, tomorrow's news today,

[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:07.920]  after years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same, FloorLife

[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:19.120]  pollen block. In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:24.720]  from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:30.560]  eyes and excessive mucus production. They began studying the effects in published trials, in
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:36.240]  their published trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:42.000]  just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.120]  starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress. Enjoy the air you

[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.360]  I was once sold on abortion thinking it was just a woman's right until I realized it was the
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:30.480]  government harvesting those babies. Live. Live from the InfoWars.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.200]  Rodgers Jones taking over these next few segments man he called the
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.120]  jucker departure at CNN on target he's got so much big news. Warnings to Trump he's gonna make as well
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:46.560]  but again I don't judge a woman that had an abortion I've been honest about this back when
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:50.080]  I was a teenager and stuff I paid for plenty of them because I bought it it's not a human and all
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:54.400]  this if you've been conned into it you're not judging you but the people on top of it's about
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:59.920]  harvesting babies it's about the humanization population control they admit that and so that's
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:04.560]  the only area I'm getting into here and I've looked it up the average woman could be paid
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:10.320]  hundreds of thousands of dollars just for the flesh of the baby if you got killing your kid I
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.520]  guess it's your body murder them no you can get some cash and if that's ever comes out it's over
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:22.320]  they're selling it all but what about the fact that people would pay to adopt your babies so
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.920]  Wes had the great point I'm gonna go out soon in front of the abortion clinic and I'm literally gonna
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:31.840]  offer a hundred thousand dollars for people to not kill their babies and they'll claim well there's
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:36.080]  a law against child trafficking I'll probably get indicted like you didn't kill the baby you
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:41.600]  wanted to pay for it but we're going to do it bet your bottom dollar Roger Stone from Florida
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:48.640]  takes over right now I'm Alex Jones join me tomorrow 11 a.m. Roger Alex thank you for bringing
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:56.160]  me in here yes it's absolutely true only months ago I predicted that Jeff Zucker the extreme left
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:04.160]  winger who is the head of CNN and who drives their anti-trump coverage would be out and indeed
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:12.240]  as Matt Drudge reported on late Friday out he is who's next is it Jake Tapper is it Wolf Blitzer
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:20.800]  is it the lovable Anna Navarro we shall see my next prediction more big shake up at CNN
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:28.960]  but here breaking news the deputy clerk of the US special court that's also known as the
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:36.080]  vaccination court has informed info wars that for the first time ever they will not publish
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:44.480]  the results of lawsuits and findings against the US government on their website why well
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:51.840]  perhaps it's because we have learned that the US government has already paid out 3.5 billion
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:59.600]  dollars to US citizens who were damaged by vaccinations the special court it records all
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.720]  of the lawsuits against the Department of Justice the Department of the Interior the
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:13.360]  Veterans Administration and our US military that's why we have absolutely proved we'd be on a
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:20.400]  shadow of a doubt that vaccinations are not safe now President Trump promised back when he was
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:26.720]  president-elect that he would appoint a special commission to study and look into the safety
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:34.000]  of vaccinations he even promised that former senator robert f kennedy son robert f kennedy
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:41.440]  junior a noted environmentalist would chair this important commission notice when the president's
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:47.200]  physical was announced last week that they said all of his vaccinations were up today
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.680]  we have called on the president who is making America great and so many other areas to keep
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:37:01.280]  this important promise but now I sense a government cover-up of the truth about vaccinations will
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:07.680]  they get away with this can they hide the evidence well fortunately a whistleblower has
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:15.120]  has obtained for info wars the initial pleadings this doesn't tell us the results of the lawsuits
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:21.600]  but it is a list of everyone who has filed a suit against the american government over the past year
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:29.440]  due to damage due to vaccinations yes we're going to bring you that uh this week on info wars we
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:35.360]  will not give up fighting against mandatory vaccinations until we get this information
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:41.920]  and we prove yet again that vaccinations are most probably not safe and we intend to continue to
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:48.800]  call on the president to keep his solemn pledge down front is a man of his word now i am disappointed
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.400]  in some of his appointments in the health area but we know from a long history of the things that he
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:00.880]  has said that he has his own concerns about the safety of vaccinations and therefore i believe
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:07.440]  the president will come through we will keep you up to date on this important story i do want to
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:14.000]  mention now that if you are liking our expanded coverage on info wars if you're enjoying the real
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.080]  news with david night in the mornings and of course the midday fair with alex jones not to mention
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:26.560]  the war room with my colleague owin schreuer uh in the afternoon understand that we are completely
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:32.320]  and totally listener and viewer supported here at info wars that's why we can investigate and
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.240]  report to you on any story that's in the news we have no corporatist masters telling us you can't
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:44.160]  say that or you can't report that or you can't follow up on the vaccination story it's too
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:50.560]  controversial nothing is too controversial for info wars we go where the truth takes us but we're
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.760]  only able to do it if you go to the info wars store now let's take a look at some of these
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:02.800]  incredible prices you're talking about 50 40 off for the entire super alpha male pack that includes
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:10.560]  both alpha power and the super male vitality i myself have now become a convert to immune wall
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:18.080]  this is the very best natural formula to promote immunity i admit i had the flu recently and it
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:23.120]  really knocked me back a good three weeks i don't think i could have turned the corner without
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.600]  immune wall and that was after the fact i suggest you take and use immune wall as a prophylactic
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:35.920]  because frankly this is the best of the old and the new oh also i think there it is immune wall
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:42.320]  this is a really an extraordinary formula combining some of the best of ancient chinese
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:49.440]  pharmacology with cutting-edge nutraceuticals to torque up your own natural immune system
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.160]  i really found that this helped me come back and if you take it prophylactically perhaps you can
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:59.120]  avoid the flu or the colds that are going around this particularly feel this particular flu
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:07.040]  is debilitating so help yourself help us it's a 360 win as alice jones likes to say
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.200]  aid it helps us pay for the expansion that he has mapped out here folks we're moving towards 24
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.360]  hours a day that's right round the clock coverage from info wars but we cannot do it with your help
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:26.960]  please go to the info war store now and support the fight for freedom i reported here on info wars
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:34.560]  several weeks ago that senator oren hatch a truly great american and my friend since 1975
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:42.400]  would retire from the u.s senate despite the urgings of president trump oren hatch has decided
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:49.840]  to throw in the towel after a long and distinguished record of public service frankly i've been around
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:56.640]  the washington seen long enough to see the sadness of those who don't know when to go uh and they
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:03.600]  ultimately end up either being defeated or running out of energy to do the job so oren hatch god bless
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.440]  you for your long record of public service in the fact that you were never corrupted by the
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:16.960]  washington buddy system you never became part of the special interest uh system of favors and
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:24.400]  backscratching a principled conservative right to the very end god bless you oren hatch but i also
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:31.600]  predicted here on info wars confirmed today by the business insider that former massachusetts
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:38.480]  governor mit romney would run for oren hatch you see what you say why would a man born in michigan
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:47.040]  and who grew up to be governor of mit of massachusetts seek a utah senate seat why would a man at his
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:54.560]  age want to be a junior member of the us senate let me reiterate reiterate it one more time for you
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:00.640]  mit romney plans to run for president of the united states in 2020 to challenge uh
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:06.000]  donald trump for the republican nomination yes with every day of trump's success that
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:13.360]  becomes less and less viable but you heard it here first make no mistake about it my sources
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:21.120]  inside the utah republican party my sources into inside the church of latter day saints are impeccable
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:27.520]  mit romney has no interest in being a junior senator at his age he is running for president
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:34.560]  you heard it here at info wars where you will get tomorrow's news today we have been very proud of
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:43.360]  our track record we predicted the uh phisa court uh uh four page memo expose months ago we were the
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.480]  ones who told you that the front line of the asa was spying on donald trump and the president was

[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:11.360]  and women couples can see their baby is having a profound effect on people's attitudes about abortion
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:17.520]  those who are pro-life that number is gaining those who favor abortion on demand that number is
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:24.880]  dropping and donald trump is helping move this needle this important needle so kudos to the
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:33.760]  president for standing up for life in a historic move that his republican predecessors never quite
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.280]  got to you see they gave lip service to the movement they wanted to harvest the votes
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:45.680]  from the life movement but they didn't want to be there when it matters down from standing tall
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:53.600]  how refreshing somebody who actually does what they say they're going to do i'm also very pleased
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:49:00.160]  to announce that i have accepted the invitation for the prestigious oxford union in the united
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:08.160]  kingdom and i will be addressing the union and then standing for their raucous q and a on january
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:17.360]  30th i also will be honored to be speaking to the durham union society on february first
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:25.600]  a similar format these are very prestigious forums in the case of the oxford union previous
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:32.320]  speakers include former president richard nixon former president ronald reagan house speaker
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:39.280]  newt gingrich and so on so i am both flattered and pleased and honored to be announced to announce
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:46.880]  that i will be visiting the uk the bow society is holding a dinner in my honor a prestigious
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:54.000]  tory society and i will be talking to selected reporters there but most importantly we're going
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:01.840]  to bring you the news right here at info wars so we will be broadcasting from london from oxford
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:10.400]  from durham look for it the week after next we have an enormous showdown coming that has
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:17.120]  political implications that info warriors need to know about the president has designated an attorney
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:24.000]  named john burman as the us attorney for the southern district of new york that is of course
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.920]  the district that president trump lives in this is where trump tower is located and where the
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:39.600]  trump organization is headquartered now however uh the mr burman is serving 128 days in a presidential
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:46.640]  appointment after which his nomination must either be sent to the u.s senate for confirmation
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:55.440]  or withdrawn senator christin jillibrand has announced that she will use her blue slip
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:02.480]  prerogative to stall and kill the nomination of john burman why you might ask why would she
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:09.120]  appoint why would she oppose the president's prerogative to name the federal prosecutor in the
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:15.360]  home jurisdiction of the president well it's quite simple you see a first year law student
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:22.800]  could take the contributions to senator chuck schumer and his votes in the us senate and quickly
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:30.480]  figure out that the good senator trades votes for money yes i just said it and it's true everybody
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:38.320]  knows that for 20 bucks you can buy chuck schumer he is a cash and carry operator known for uh his
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:46.480]  groveling for special interest contributions now the thin read that miss jillibrand who is a sock
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:55.120]  puppet for senator schumer gives us is that mr burman has done legal work for deuchess bag
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:01.920]  and that deuchess bank has been a substantial lender to the real estate projects of the trump
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:08.160]  organization the implication of course is that the president or the trump organization has
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:15.360]  done something wrong this is a dark rumor among lefties that doesn't seem to have any basis in
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:23.440]  fact here are the facts jillibrand and schumer will oppose any honest prosecutor whose name is put
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:33.120]  forward by uh by uh president trump and uh we we know that this will end up in the hands of
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:40.400]  senator chuck grasley grasley will either honor the blue slip from uh senator jillibrand or he
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:47.120]  will move this for a vote and now my colleague owin schreuer is calling in with breaking news
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:54.160]  owin lay it on us well roger uh i have a bad voice right now i blew my voice out yesterday
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:53:00.480]  shouting down the racist fascist trump hating america hating uh libtards in the streets of new
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:05.200]  york yesterday but here's the story roger last night there was an event and everybody's talking
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:10.720]  about chelsea manning who showed up at a conservative event last night and just to give you a little
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:15.520]  background she showed up and everyone was nice to her everyone was cordial there was nothing
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.640]  bad about it there was no arguments or anything so everything seems fine then she goes on social
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.640]  media and says that it's a bunch of white supremacists and she's talking trash on us and all this
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:30.480]  stuff so that was the story that kind of broke on chelsea manning but then we realized something
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:34.880]  at dinner tonight when we were discussing this there was another phenomenon from the event last
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:41.360]  night roger where antifa somehow knew where the event was and that's because it got doxed now
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:47.360]  mike sernovich had to change locations of this event three was it three times twice yes so this
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:54.000]  was a third venue that he was that he was using so there was no way for them to actually know where
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:00.080]  we were there was no way for them to have planned a protest outside because they couldn't have possibly
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:04.720]  known where they are because sernovich kept that address close to his chest plus he had to move it
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:10.400]  i think like either 24 or 48 hours before the event even happened so antifa shows up violently
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:15.120]  and everyone's wondering how they found out who doxed us who released the address and then it
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:21.520]  hit us it was chelsea manning it had to be chelsea manning she's obviously anti-conservative
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:26.480]  she's obvious or or just a puppet of the obama administration she reaches a deal with obama
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:31.520]  i'm theorizing here roger but you know she cut to deal with obama obama gives her a pardon now
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:37.680]  she's obama's puppet but regardless everyone was wondering how the event got doxed last night
[01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:42.480]  everyone was wondering i think i think we've figured it out i think it was chelsea manning
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:46.960]  she was at the event she would have been the only one who would have sent that address an event
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:52.720]  location out so that antifa could have showed up so for all those who heard about antifa showing up
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.320]  and trying to protest violently outside of a night for freedom last night i do believe
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.280]  since we can't figure out we cannot put our finger on who doxed the event sernovich kept the
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:08.400]  address close to his chest we believe that it was chelsea manning that doxed the event
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.840]  so that antifa could show up and then they even violently beat up a woman was it a woman or a
[01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:20.480]  man that left the event so so a couple people got attacked by antifa because somebody doxed and
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.640]  released the information on the event and we believe that that was chelsea manning roger
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:28.480]  my voice is about to go you can probably hear it i gotta sign off buddy we'll talk to you next
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:34.800]  week on the war room god bless all right a terrific report there a stunning report from my colleague

[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:49.600]  while we are here at info wars it's important for me to mention to you that the efforts of facebook
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:55.280]  to crack down on conservatives have switched into high gear late last week there was a new
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:02.320]  communique from mr zuckerberg in which they justify the crackdown that is happening my
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:07.760]  colleague and friend jason feik has told me that literally millions of trump supporters are being
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:13.840]  disenfranchised so here's the point if you like what you're seeing at info wars if you like the
