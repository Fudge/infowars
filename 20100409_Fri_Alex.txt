[00:00.000 --> 00:14.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.040 --> 00:23.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen
[00:23.960 --> 00:31.880]  it is April 9th 2010 I am Jason Burmos sitting in for Alex Jones we have Bob Chapman coming up in
[00:31.880 --> 00:38.280]  the second hour and we are joined by Mark Dice for the entire first hour of course Mark Dice is
[00:38.280 --> 00:46.200]  featured in my newest documentary Invisible Empire a new world order defined and I did this film
[00:46.840 --> 00:53.640]  because of really the lack of knowledge out in the culture right now and even out in the culture
[00:53.640 --> 01:02.360]  when I was asleep 10 years ago now I had no idea about this stuff and Mark it really saddens me to
[01:02.360 --> 01:11.240]  see a society a once great society of manufactured cloned puppets that suck on pop culture and really
[01:11.240 --> 01:16.840]  are so involved in the minutiae of their favorite sports team or their favorite celebrity that they
[01:16.840 --> 01:21.240]  cannot see what's really going on around them no and that is part of the new world order to
[01:21.240 --> 01:25.800]  distract everybody with bread and circus and that's why I'm really looking forward to this film
[01:25.800 --> 01:32.600]  congratulations it looks absolutely amazing and and that is what they need that's why the new
[01:32.600 --> 01:37.720]  world order has been able to succeed obviously because people aren't politically aware and I
[01:37.720 --> 01:43.160]  think the time is right with this now because you have a segment of the population after 9-11 that
[01:43.160 --> 01:48.200]  knew that it was an inside job or that we're just against the wars in general that's that's one
[01:48.200 --> 01:53.320]  particular issue there's a large segment of the population that obviously supported the war or
[01:53.320 --> 01:57.800]  just we're really indifferent but now that the economic collapse has happened a lot of people
[01:57.800 --> 02:04.360]  are looking for answers as to why as to who to blame they're getting worried and so now everybody's
[02:04.360 --> 02:09.400]  lives are affected because you know with 9-11 a lot of people were disconnected they didn't feel
[02:09.400 --> 02:15.240]  a personal connection to the war to the soldiers that they didn't feel that you know sending the
[02:15.240 --> 02:21.000]  soldiers over to die that fairly affected them but now everybody's pocketbook is affected everybody's
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.600]  talking about the economic collapse everybody wants to know you know what group what what sort of
[02:26.600 --> 02:33.560]  back room deals led to this collapse and and is continuing to just run the country down the toilet
[02:33.560 --> 02:39.320]  and so I think this is just fantastic I think this is the primer it looks better than any history
[02:39.320 --> 02:44.600]  channel show I've ever seen I mean this is going to be fantastic well thank you so much Mark and
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.040]  as you were talking about the economy you're right now that the Obama administration is in we are
[02:50.040 --> 02:55.800]  bringing in so-called conservatives of course you and I know that the there is a false left right
[02:55.800 --> 03:01.160]  paradigm out here out there to control both of us to make us really choose sides and think we're
[03:01.160 --> 03:06.920]  part of a team I got news for you folks we're not part of any team at all it's us versus them you
[03:06.920 --> 03:14.440]  have more in common than your so-called liberal counterparts than you realize and Bernanke yesterday
[03:14.440 --> 03:19.640]  it was uh and the Associated Press is saying now we have to make difficult choices remember the
[03:19.640 --> 03:24.040]  economy was recovering and now they made up a new term it's a double-dip recession it's really a
[03:24.040 --> 03:30.120]  depression folks they're telling you 10 on employment it's 20 plus percent in this country don't
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.240]  believe the hype he's saying to avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits the nation will
[03:35.240 --> 03:39.880]  ultimately have to choose among and it won't be a choice they'll be doing all of these things
[03:39.880 --> 03:45.080]  among higher taxes so they're going to raise your taxes they're already taking 20 30 sometimes
[03:45.080 --> 03:51.080]  40 and 50 percent depending on what uh tax bracket you're in modifications to entitlement programs
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.920]  such as social security and medicare and those aren't entitlement programs those are programs
[03:54.920 --> 04:00.520]  we've paid into our entire lives forcibly through our paychecks we don't really get a choice there
[04:00.520 --> 04:04.840]  so they're going to take away those programs and raise taxes and now they're out in the open
[04:04.840 --> 04:09.960]  talking about it mark yeah i don't know that i want to talk to about taxes obviously tax day
[04:09.960 --> 04:16.440]  april 15th uh also the release of invisible empires that also the deadline for your extortion
[04:16.440 --> 04:21.560]  check to be sent in to the to the federal government for your income tax and so a lot of people
[04:21.560 --> 04:27.960]  obviously in this movement in this audience are are involved in seeing how the tax scheme is a
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.760]  fraud everybody's probably seen and russo's film america freedom to fascism and some people
[04:32.760 --> 04:36.600]  might just think well i'm just not going to pay them and i just want to urge you that i i've done
[04:36.600 --> 04:42.520]  that before and i can tell you that after about a year or so we'll catch up to you and uh you'll
[04:42.520 --> 04:47.800]  pay have a heavy fine and they're going to garnish your check so even though yes the income tax is
[04:47.800 --> 04:52.600]  a fraud it needs to be taken care of on a legislative level and if you just don't talk about that more

[08:17.800 --> 08:24.200]  dot tv and info wars dot com right now we're joined by mark dice and i want to talk a little bit
[08:24.200 --> 08:27.720]  about this because there's a lot there's a crowd out there that doesn't pay their taxes that thinks
[08:27.720 --> 08:33.720]  that common law is the answer but what they don't understand is by paying your taxes you stay out
[08:33.720 --> 08:38.440]  of their crosshairs and their system further i mean tell us your experience with not paying your
[08:38.440 --> 08:43.320]  taxes mark we admit it's not legal we promote freedom to fascism we're trying to get the
[08:43.320 --> 08:47.800]  information out there but at the same time we don't want to end up in a prison cell we don't
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.080]  want the very little assets that we actually have taken away or garnished yeah it is extortion
[08:53.080 --> 08:57.960]  we're all in agreement on that and about five years ago i just decided to just not pay i just
[08:57.960 --> 09:03.720]  didn't even file i just said forget about it you know and it i they sent me a few letters saying
[09:03.720 --> 09:09.080]  and you forgot to file of course i just ignored all of them and i just just figured it would go away
[09:10.360 --> 09:16.840]  and they started garnishing my wages at at my day job and which of course is i should have known
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.240]  that they were going to do i just didn't realize that yeah a year goes by and they thought figure
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.840]  they just forgot about it no no started garnishing my wages and i think i paid over a five hundred
[09:26.840 --> 09:32.920]  dollar fine interest and all this stuff and so you know yesterday i posted a message on my facebook
[09:32.920 --> 09:39.160]  page just reminding people to get their taxes done on time you know pay your extortion check on time
[09:39.160 --> 09:43.480]  you don't have to pay the fines and the interest and a couple guys on there that were saying oh
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.480]  you're just funding you know you shouldn't be complaining about the new world order because
[09:47.480 --> 09:52.520]  you're just funding them you're just paying their check you know you're you're sending them the money
[09:52.520 --> 09:57.800]  to have them build a new world order and so you shouldn't even complain about it i'm just thinking
[09:57.800 --> 10:04.680]  well you know i actually agree that the taxes are illegal it is extortion but we need to take
[10:04.680 --> 10:10.440]  care of this on a legislative level by just simply not paying your taxes it may seem like you're
[10:10.440 --> 10:15.560]  protesting but honestly you're just a number they don't care they're going to start garnishing your
[10:15.560 --> 10:20.840]  wages they're going to come to your door they will seize your assets and so there's a better way
[10:20.840 --> 10:27.960]  to fight the tax revolt than there is uh just to simply not pay it and people mark they think that
[10:27.960 --> 10:31.640]  there's a silver bullet out there they think that there's these solutions that are going to happen
[10:31.640 --> 10:38.120]  overnight i have the solution they believe in phony documents and underground seal teams that are
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.000]  ready to save us at a moment's notice no that's not how the world works you have to work towards a
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.760]  goal you have to gain momentum you have to get people behind an idea and you have to mobilize them
[10:48.760 --> 10:52.840]  i think that civil disobedience is one of the greatest ways that we can achieve these kind
[10:52.840 --> 10:58.040]  of goals but first we have to educate the public we have to explain to them their methods their
[10:58.040 --> 11:03.480]  modes of control the organizations out there that really do matter that do pull the strings that set
[11:03.480 --> 11:09.240]  the policy that sit in the boardrooms and decide what your and my life is going to look like in
[11:09.240 --> 11:15.400]  the next five to ten years if we get more people like congressman ron paul on our side or we start
[11:15.400 --> 11:21.720]  taking part in massive tax day protests uh just getting hundreds of thousands millions of people
[11:21.720 --> 11:28.360]  in multiple cities clamoring we use films like invisible empire and others to educate those that
[11:28.360 --> 11:32.360]  aren't aware you know some people in the audience may think that they already know everything that
[11:32.360 --> 11:36.760]  there is to know maybe they're obsessed with researching this as we are but i can guarantee
[11:36.760 --> 11:41.240]  you that there's stuff out there and in little aspects of of this that that we don't know about
[11:41.240 --> 11:47.480]  and i myself become very educated even from your films and from other films and as much as i obsessed
[11:47.480 --> 11:51.960]  about this and research this i certainly don't know everything uh and so the films are great
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.000]  especially you know some people think oh this is just the same old stuff rehashed well then maybe
[11:57.000 --> 12:01.960]  it's not for you maybe it's for your friends and your family and so instead of sending them a link
[12:01.960 --> 12:06.040]  to a youtube video and saying here check this out maybe you should have everybody over for a party
[12:06.040 --> 12:10.040]  and watch it on your 50 inch flash screen and that that's how you're going to get the message
[12:10.040 --> 12:15.080]  across because everybody's so busy you send someone a link to one-tenth of the part of of the
[12:15.080 --> 12:20.920]  digital empire or some other films or end game or some of the stuff about 9 11 and maybe they
[12:20.920 --> 12:25.800]  watch it maybe they don't you know you get jokes from your family and friends and you know if you're
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.240]  busy you're just going to pass through it so that's why i i think i saw alex did a quick video
[12:31.240 --> 12:35.560]  urging viewing parties it's just really the best thing to do because now i'd rather watch it on a
[12:35.560 --> 12:41.080]  50 inch flash screen than you know watching it on a tiny little laptop computer or you have it at
[12:41.080 --> 12:45.320]  your local church or community center and you get one of those projectors and it's actually on a
[12:45.320 --> 12:49.080]  movie screen i can't tell you how many times we did that with loose change and loose change
[12:49.080 --> 12:55.880]  final cut in fact i want to play a sneak peek right now of invisible empire and this is a
[12:55.880 --> 13:00.760]  section dealing with the council on foreign relations it features g edward griffin and we're
[13:00.760 --> 13:05.960]  going to come back after that so this is a brand new sneak peek of my latest film coming out april
[13:05.960 --> 13:14.120]  15th tax day invisible empire a new world order defined here's a short sneak peek from the council
[13:14.120 --> 13:20.040]  on foreign relations roundtable groups section from invisible empire in all of the british
[13:20.040 --> 13:25.800]  dependencies these organizations the front groups were called the royal institute for international
[13:25.800 --> 13:33.000]  affairs in the united states they chose a different name they chose the council on foreign relations
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.960]  but it held exactly the same relationship to this inner society of uh seasaw roads among the
[13:39.960 --> 13:44.840]  charter members were wavril harriman of union banking then president of the united states
[13:44.840 --> 13:51.640]  woodrow wilson's main advisor journal edward mendell house john d rockefeller the founder of standard
[13:51.640 --> 14:05.160]  oil banking mogul jp morgan and prominent bankster paul warbird well the council and foreign relations
[14:05.160 --> 14:12.120]  exist today it's probably the most powerful single organization in america many observers
[14:12.120 --> 14:18.440]  including myself believe that it is the hidden government of the united states these people
[14:18.440 --> 14:25.320]  are not elected to office and most americans don't even know who they are but they are holding all of
[14:25.320 --> 14:29.960]  the important positions in society they're only about four thousand of them in the united states
[14:29.960 --> 14:34.120]  but i don't care what organization you want to look at whether it's government or whether it's
[14:34.120 --> 14:40.680]  universities or the large immediate centers or whatever it is you look at the people at the
[14:40.680 --> 14:46.680]  tops of those organizations the owners the managers the ceo's the board of directors
[14:46.680 --> 14:54.120]  and i'm going to say probably 80 to 90 percent of the great power centers of america are dominated
[14:54.120 --> 15:00.920]  by just those four thousand people who are members of the council and foreign relations
[15:00.920 --> 15:07.160]  that was just a short clip from invisible empire where we're chronicling how the shadow government
[15:07.160 --> 15:12.760]  controls society through groups like the council on foreign relations that operate as front groups
[15:12.760 --> 15:17.720]  for the roundtable group intelligence systems that control our society from behind the throne
[15:20.280 --> 15:25.080]  there it is folks invisible empire a new world order to find at prisonplanet.tv first and we're
[15:25.080 --> 15:30.680]  streaming their live i also want to remind people to support acola blue dot com acola blue fresh
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.720]  water from the air you don't even need a source it makes up to seven and a half gallons of water
[15:35.720 --> 15:43.160]  per day call them at one eight hundred six nine one six zero four three or go to acola blue dot com
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.840]  mark that's just a small snippet of my film it's two hours and 12 minutes and i really
[15:48.840 --> 15:54.360]  think that g edward griffin being one of the primary characters in the patriot movement somebody
[15:54.360 --> 16:01.800]  who's been around for i believe 50 plus years he made movies like katanga the capitalist conspiracy
[16:01.800 --> 16:08.120]  back in the 70s when really all she had was well not even a powerpoint presentation it was literally
[16:08.120 --> 16:13.160]  slides on a projector and to progress to the level where we're using after effects we're
[16:13.160 --> 16:18.200]  we're using final cut pro we're not only getting to the level of the history channel but surpassing
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.840]  it in many ways is very exciting to me because i feel like not only are we going to reach a younger
[16:22.840 --> 16:28.120]  audience a newer audience but it's going to hold true with our already great audience out there who
[16:28.120 --> 16:34.520]  can make copies and hand it out to people and unfortunately you can put together a tremendous
[16:34.520 --> 16:39.320]  film or even just a videotape of a speech of somebody and it isn't going to have the impact
[16:39.320 --> 16:46.760]  because we're so used to the mtv style quick graphics and just incredible sound and so that
[16:46.760 --> 16:51.240]  you know you're sort of playing their game if your culture jamming the system you're using
[16:51.240 --> 16:57.640]  their own game against them which i think is is fantastic well i've often talked to you about how
[16:57.640 --> 17:02.680]  we're going to win this thing and i said if we don't have our own media arm if we don't have our
[17:02.680 --> 17:10.200]  own competition for cnn msnbc and fox news we truly are going to be doomed we do need something
[17:10.200 --> 17:15.800]  like info wars and prison planet that pumps out 25 stories a day that pumps out three or four
[17:15.800 --> 17:22.920]  documentaries a year that keeps up on the activism front that keeps people in tune with the real news
[17:22.920 --> 17:29.000]  the real issues how else are we supposed to compete with literal multi-billion and trillion
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.160]  dollar corporations like general electric and westinghouse that own nbc and all of these other
[17:35.160 --> 17:41.160]  huge networks well probably the elks jones radio shows fantastic too because we do need
[17:41.160 --> 17:45.560]  you know a daily radio shows several hours because i mean what are you going to choose from
[17:45.560 --> 17:52.520]  john hannity glenn beck rush limbo i mean you know even if you're a conservative okay some of their
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.360]  issues that they talk about might be interesting but once you understand that they are just a
[17:56.360 --> 18:01.320]  bunch of propaganda and a bunch of gatekeepers you need some sort of an alternative so you
[18:01.320 --> 18:05.800]  know the alex jones show other shows like and are just perfect because you can sit there you
[18:05.800 --> 18:10.440]  can download the mp3 they have the great guest because occasionally the mainstream media will
[18:10.440 --> 18:16.280]  get a guest like gerald salante on or peter shift but you know that's very rare and it's for one
[18:16.280 --> 18:21.880]  segment so you maybe get five minutes of their knowledge so you get alex jones show other shows
[18:21.880 --> 18:26.360]  your show and you know you can get these people on there and you'll interview them for a half an hour
[18:26.360 --> 18:32.040]  45 minutes or for a full hour to get a little more comprehensive understanding instead of just
[18:32.040 --> 18:37.240]  the sound bite mentality of the rare occurrence that peter shift for any of these other heroes
[18:37.240 --> 18:42.360]  that can enter the polytano are on the mainstream news just a few seconds of what they have to say
[18:42.360 --> 18:49.160]  versus 30 minutes or an hour absolutely and when you're listening to this mainline garbage
[18:49.160 --> 18:55.160]  you're fitting the mold that they're really crafting for you they want you to be on one side
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.880]  or the other they don't want you to look at both sides i often look at both sides of the picture
[18:59.880 --> 19:04.520]  the right perspective the left perspective of course our perspective so that i can take those
[19:04.520 --> 19:10.760]  and analyze them and find out what is the real deal what does the evidence point towards what
[19:10.760 --> 19:16.440]  can we do to stop this how do we educate people about these issues and obviously like you said
[19:16.440 --> 19:23.160]  the economy is a huge hot button issue and it's being manipulated on all fronts right now in fact
[19:23.160 --> 19:27.720]  the new york times is running a headline when they're saying why so glum numbers point to
[19:27.720 --> 19:34.520]  her recovery yes they point to her recovery when the banks are giving out record numbers to their
[19:34.520 --> 19:40.760]  own associates while they take your pension funds that's right record bonuses for their guys as they

[24:33.720 --> 24:41.880]  jones show we're joined by mark dice and i really want to talk about being mesmerized hypnotized
[24:41.880 --> 24:49.720]  by the system because again i can remember myself in 99 2000 even after the 9 11 attacks without
[24:49.720 --> 24:56.120]  really looking into it just being totally brain damaged and dead it was only 9 11 that got me
[24:56.120 --> 25:00.920]  even involved in the mainstream media that's where i started watching these 24 hour news
[25:00.920 --> 25:08.040]  network starting to realize that geo politics was important before that i was watching temptation
[25:08.040 --> 25:12.840]  island i was watching every garbage show that's out there i would probably still be the guy
[25:12.840 --> 25:19.080]  watching jersey shore or some other crap like that if i hadn't awakened to the real system in fact
[25:19.080 --> 25:23.240]  later on tonight i'm going to be on tap out radio a lot of people out there know that i'm a huge
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.560]  MMA fan but i'm going to have the opportunity for an hour to reach out to an audience that 90%
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.920]  of them probably don't have any idea what i'm going to talk about i can introduce them to an idea
[25:34.920 --> 25:41.400]  like the new world order and quite frankly when i first watched road to tyranny alex jones's film
[25:41.400 --> 25:46.440]  about 9 11 not only did i not want to believe it but i was uncomfortable with the term new world
[25:46.440 --> 25:50.840]  order i was like why doesn't this guy stick to global elite or something like this new world
[25:50.840 --> 25:55.320]  order makes him sound like a kook it makes him sound like all those christians that think that
[25:55.320 --> 26:01.160]  the world is going to end and the rapture is about to come here i don't want to hear that but as i
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.600]  progressed mark as i learned more and more and more i realized hey wait a minute new world order
[26:06.600 --> 26:12.840]  is their term and that's why i made this film i made this film because i'm taking their propaganda
[26:12.840 --> 26:17.320]  and using it against them and i'm showing what it's really about i'm exposing that a new world
[26:17.320 --> 26:23.320]  order is truly a government in which the state is god where they micromanage your entire life
[26:23.320 --> 26:29.080]  in a cashless society control grid where your every single move is tracked traced and databaseed
[26:29.080 --> 26:34.520]  through an rfid implant mark and you are a big part of this film why don't you speak to the fact
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.120]  that people can have awakenings that they don't have to be drones all their lives
[26:38.120 --> 26:43.480]  it you know and we're not saying that you you need to completely smash your television and
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.960]  never watch anything again i mean of course with moderation it's it's good to have your
[26:47.960 --> 26:53.880]  entertainment you have your your multiple your mma fights for for entertainment and it's okay but
[26:53.880 --> 26:59.320]  just among most people watch as much television as they do as a person has a part-time or even
[26:59.320 --> 27:05.640]  a full-time job that's a problem and so you have this high tech system and our celebrities are built
[27:05.640 --> 27:09.400]  up you know let's just look at some of the celebrities and what they've done with their
[27:09.400 --> 27:15.640]  lives as you have sober house with dr drew or celebrity rehab you know these these icons
[27:15.640 --> 27:19.480]  that are built up and then that's what they've done with their lives they have destroyed
[27:19.480 --> 27:23.080]  their lives and that's that's really what the new world order wants you to do so that you're not
[27:23.080 --> 27:26.840]  going to go to a protest so that you're not going to be educated so they want you to just
[27:27.560 --> 27:35.560]  waste away your life in a fictional world of pop culture and reality television and of course
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.200]  you know i said in moderation it's okay yeah this stuff you don't need to be constantly
[27:40.200 --> 27:45.240]  researching the new world order only watching dvds about this kind of stuff but really just take a
[27:45.240 --> 27:51.880]  step back and look at your life and just think am i wasting hours of my day or of my week you know
[27:51.880 --> 27:57.560]  could i be doing at least something more productive could i be having fun with my friends and family
[27:57.560 --> 28:04.680]  could i be out exercising doing a hobby uh you know enjoying nature uh something to that effect
[28:04.680 --> 28:12.520]  and that that's a major goal of the new world order is to to uh hypnotize us to create a standard
[28:12.520 --> 28:19.240]  of of immorality and selfishness and some people criticize me all because i'm just a christian
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.880]  and i say that but even from a secular standpoint you have to admit that it's it's horrific what's
[28:23.880 --> 28:28.680]  happening in society and we have we have kids doing things that that are just they really
[28:28.680 --> 28:34.200]  should not be doing there's there's new phenomena going on in the culture uh that that people are
[28:34.200 --> 28:39.720]  just utterly shocked i myself am shocked i mean jason we're about the same age i'm i'm only 32
[28:39.720 --> 28:44.040]  and i still just look around at how much the world has changed in 10 years no i can't believe that
[28:44.040 --> 28:49.000]  10 year old girls idolize whores like paris hilden as if they're real celebrities no they're
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.560]  celebratards that were born into billions of dollars who have wasted their life on the
[28:53.560 --> 29:00.040]  literal most shallow things you could care about without having any semblance of reality
[29:00.040 --> 29:05.400]  that surrounds them they have no idea what the real world is like they spend their lives going
[29:05.400 --> 29:11.240]  around to these little parties getting coked up and little girls small girls your daughters your
[29:11.240 --> 29:16.280]  nephews your nieces your the people that are going to grow up and supposed to take care of you when
[29:16.280 --> 29:22.120]  you're old are not going to have a moral compass they are going to watch things like celebrity rehab
[29:22.120 --> 29:26.360]  and think you know what i should be partying my entire life they don't see that that could turn
[29:26.360 --> 29:32.120]  into them that they're going to crash and burn no they want to be like these rock star idiots out
[29:32.120 --> 29:36.760]  there that don't have any clue what's going on but they don't realize it's never going to get that far

[33:36.360 --> 33:43.240]  on the website all these things are over at info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv and i want
[33:43.240 --> 33:47.880]  to talk about this call to action because without you guys out there without the listeners without
[33:47.880 --> 33:52.520]  the viewers without people burning these discs and getting them out to their friends their family
[33:52.520 --> 33:58.280]  members and complete strangers yes i said complete strangers we don't have an impact that's why loose
[33:58.280 --> 34:04.760]  change was so huge because people saw a resonance in a message copied the discs handed them out
[34:04.760 --> 34:11.080]  in masses really got the word out and we need that again and i'm not trying to brag here but back
[34:11.080 --> 34:17.240]  in 2002 when i first woke up to this stuff and there wasn't a prison planet dot tv where i could
[34:17.240 --> 34:23.720]  just out all of alex jones's films i was actually making my own disc this is before dvdr's were out
[34:23.720 --> 34:31.480]  there i was burning cdr's from file share pro i was using like morpheus and kaza all the the
[34:31.480 --> 34:36.200]  predecessors to limewire basically newtella i was on all these little networks and i was getting
[34:36.200 --> 34:41.320]  the alex jones films and i was getting raw video from 9 11 and i was creating folders this is before
[34:41.320 --> 34:49.080]  i was a filmmaker 2002 and i was burning cd after cd of things like masters of terror matrix of evil
[34:49.080 --> 34:54.840]  in 2004 when that came out i might even been 2003 and getting the word out saying hey check this out
[34:54.840 --> 34:58.440]  now a lot of people would just throw the disc away but some people would watch one or two of the
[34:58.440 --> 35:02.680]  things and then they'd watch the rest and say wow this is some pretty interesting stuff but is it
[35:02.680 --> 35:08.760]  all true and now i can put together a package a two hour and 12 minute movie that if you have no
[35:08.760 --> 35:15.640]  idea what global governance is what a one world order might look like you can have that information
[35:15.640 --> 35:21.400]  in a couple of hours and with you the listeners out there handing them out it can have just
[35:21.400 --> 35:27.400]  such an impact mark you yourself went through colleges and rated a classrooms handing out
[35:27.400 --> 35:33.640]  loose change yeah and even before that uh... i was downloading films off of bear share alex
[35:33.640 --> 35:39.480]  jones films too and just saving them as though you know windows media files and i was giving them
[35:39.480 --> 35:45.240]  out to people and friends and former teachers of mine and so yeah i just got so angry and i
[35:45.240 --> 35:50.840]  realized that this information is so powerful and so important and it it needed to pierce
[35:50.840 --> 35:56.520]  the mainstream and that's what i've you know tried to do with calling into these mainstream shows
[35:57.240 --> 36:03.320]  we usually my way into the gossip column the celebrity gossip column criticizing celebrities
[36:03.320 --> 36:08.280]  in a in a relevant way and then pointing people down the path they can find a bigger bigger picture
[36:08.280 --> 36:12.760]  and and we didn't need to continue that because people now are looking for answers like i said
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.920]  before a lot of people didn't care about the war they didn't think it affected them people weren't
[36:16.920 --> 36:22.120]  involved in politics we just didn't care but now that their pocketbook is hurt now that they're
[36:22.120 --> 36:26.440]  scared that they're going to lose their job maybe they've taken a pay cut maybe they've had to cut
[36:26.440 --> 36:32.840]  back from full time to part time maybe they've lost their 401k match uh... their friends and
[36:32.840 --> 36:37.640]  families that could be losing their home people now are looking for answers so this is a perfect
[36:37.640 --> 36:44.120]  time to give them those answers absolutely and uh saying that we are now going to play this call
[36:44.120 --> 36:50.520]  to action by alex jones for my new film invisible empire a new world order defined comes out april

[37:45.160 --> 37:50.600]  with the establishment of the g20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else

[41:32.600 --> 41:46.920]  888-253-3139 and mark i believe in this country i believe in humanity in general and i know that
[41:46.920 --> 41:53.400]  there are a lot of well-meaning ignorant people out there that believe in climate change that
[41:53.400 --> 41:58.920]  don't understand that it's really about not only a global government folks but about population
[41:58.920 --> 42:05.240]  control about population reduction about getting into every facet of your life and this film exposes
[42:05.240 --> 42:11.160]  that amongst other things a lot of people are just misguided of what their modes of control are if
[42:11.160 --> 42:15.400]  they can't get you with the war they're going to try to get you with the environment that's what
[42:15.400 --> 42:20.760]  this false left right paradigm is and that's why it's so crucial to break that paradigm mark
[42:21.480 --> 42:26.840]  yes and i myself but it's embarrassing for me to admit this but uh at the onset of the war in
[42:26.840 --> 42:33.880]  iraq i still was not awakened to 9 11 i'm still not awakened to uh the false like terrorism i was
[42:33.880 --> 42:38.840]  just a typical college kid and i remember on my college campus there were some people protesting
[42:39.320 --> 42:44.600]  uh the onset of the war right right before operations shocking on they had a microphone and
[42:44.600 --> 42:48.440]  people could get up there and say their piece about why we should do this and i ran up there and i
[42:48.440 --> 42:53.080]  grabbed the microphone and i said you know you people don't know what's going on i said you
[42:53.080 --> 42:58.840]  spend most of your time watching t you know mtv reading us weekly i so you need to just
[42:58.840 --> 43:03.560]  you know trust our leaders and they know they have more information more knowledge than you do
[43:03.560 --> 43:08.600]  so if they want to go to war i'm sure that there's a good reason and you know there was a good reason
[43:08.600 --> 43:13.320]  it was just not the reason that i had thought at that time and you know i had i had well meaning
[43:13.320 --> 43:20.040]  intentions but i was you know using my extreme extrovert itself to go up there and do what i
[43:20.040 --> 43:25.960]  thought needed to be done uh just you know to put these people down and i'm very embarrassed about
[43:25.960 --> 43:30.920]  that now because now that i realized the bigger picture i see the error of my ways and so i'm
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.320]  sure there's a lot of other people out there that are like me like you uh that that are really
[43:35.320 --> 43:41.640]  passionate and want to do good and to think that sean hannity is a great american and we need to
[43:41.640 --> 43:48.200]  help uh wake those people up and and to get them on our side and it might be a slow process but i
[43:48.200 --> 43:53.160]  think looking how far we've come now i mean i was downloading films off of bear share and streaming
[43:53.160 --> 43:59.560]  on this is before youtube and and it's so much easier now we can we can grab somebody's attention
[43:59.560 --> 44:05.560]  so much faster than we did even just four years ago and that's why they're going after the internet
[44:05.560 --> 44:11.000]  they do realize that the internet does pose a great threat to them not just wiki leaks not just
[44:11.000 --> 44:17.000]  krypton but really google video was shut down because of the success of loose change final cut
[44:17.000 --> 44:22.680]  and then it started happening with terror storm and end game and even films like zeitgeist got too
[44:22.680 --> 44:28.280]  big for their britches and they had to literally shut that down and put you in this new youtube
[44:28.280 --> 44:33.480]  paradigm with the two companies merging can't even upload anything to google video folks i
[44:33.480 --> 44:38.600]  uploaded my last movie to google video i couldn't get any stats on it i was number two in the world
[44:38.600 --> 44:43.880]  within 24 hours of the release i was number one in the world within 48 hours of release and then
[44:43.880 --> 44:49.000]  i just disappeared for the page for an entire week mark where i couldn't even find myself in the top
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.720]  one thousand no and then you know the big brother grid i see as a part of the film and it's incredible
[44:55.720 --> 45:02.200]  people think that that organizations are systems like echelon is some sort of a conspiracy theory
[45:02.200 --> 45:08.760]  but it's very true and and we're really as bad as it is now with the big brother scenario and with
[45:08.760 --> 45:16.920]  their magic memory holes it's getting worse and it's interesting a lot of people may use terminology
[45:16.920 --> 45:24.520]  from george orwell's 1984 novel such as memory hole big brother or wellian thought police all
[45:24.520 --> 45:31.480]  of these terms were actually coined by george orwell in his novel that was published in 1949
[45:32.040 --> 45:38.280]  and it's so crazy because he so accurately predicted it's almost prosthetic what his
[45:38.280 --> 45:43.960]  book is i mean here's a here's a description of him talking about telescreen a lot of people
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.920]  may be familiar this other audience members knew may not which are the screens that he wrote about
[45:48.920 --> 45:55.240]  that watched and listened everybody into society and this is what he wrote in 1949 quote the telescreen
[45:55.240 --> 46:00.120]  received and transmitted simultaneously and he found that went and made above the level of a low
[46:00.120 --> 46:05.160]  whisper would be picked up by it moreover so as long as he remained within the field of vision of
[46:05.160 --> 46:12.280]  the metal plaque he could be seen as well as heard he had to live did live from habit that
[46:12.280 --> 46:18.200]  became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness
[46:18.200 --> 46:24.600]  every movement and that's what's happening with that we have all the cameras over the street
[46:24.600 --> 46:30.360]  now i am sure you cover this in the film and putting cameras in in school bathrooms they're
[46:30.360 --> 46:35.240]  putting cameras in private citizens home and let's stop right there let's talk about that right
[46:35.240 --> 46:42.600]  there in the united kingdom the so-called other great nation in the westernized world in europe
[46:42.600 --> 46:49.160]  they are putting cctv cameras they already have in 2000 plus homes and that was over a year ago
[46:49.160 --> 46:54.680]  and they said within the next 24 months they were going to try to make it 20 000 homes and of course
[46:54.680 --> 47:00.440]  they always pick the dregs of society the people that they've cps their kids or have been in and
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.400]  out family court the ones that are taking social services over there but it starts with them and
[47:05.400 --> 47:12.200]  it goes to everybody else and i don't care how bad it is we shouldn't have cctv cameras that are man
[47:12.200 --> 47:17.880]  24 7 in our homes it wouldn't matter if they weren't man but they realized they don't have enough
[47:17.880 --> 47:23.160]  infrastructure enough personnel to have them watch those cameras so what we also cover in the movie
[47:23.160 --> 47:28.120]  is the fact that you can now watch from the from your computer you don't have to be a law enforcement
[47:28.120 --> 47:34.360]  officer no you can be just a random person who gets cash prizes for turning in criminals from
[47:34.360 --> 47:43.320]  watching random cctv cameras mark and these cctv cameras as of last year in london um i don't know
[47:43.320 --> 47:50.440]  how many but they've implemented a program called isis it stands for integrated sensor information
[47:50.440 --> 47:57.480]  system now isis is the egyptian goddess uh and mother of the sun god oris and and these are
[47:57.480 --> 48:04.440]  pre-crime cameras they have created a software system that looks at groups of people and by
[48:04.440 --> 48:12.120]  and it's allegedly can determine whether they're getting hostile or or whether they're uh participating
[48:12.120 --> 48:18.920]  in suspicious behavior and i mean one of the officials said quote when a crime looks like
[48:18.920 --> 48:25.880]  it's going to occur the system will verbally warn the perpetrator and if necessary alert the nearest
[48:25.880 --> 48:33.480]  police officer and this is this is what's happening and this is only this is last year and just imagine
[48:33.480 --> 48:37.320]  what's going to happen in the next few years when these systems come on holland has a system
[48:37.960 --> 48:44.760]  that can record and listen to conversations from up to a hundred yards away using an echelon type
[48:44.760 --> 48:49.480]  of keyword system so if somebody's on the streets and they're talking about a particular issue
[48:49.480 --> 48:54.120]  they're talking about the new world order and they happen to mention several keywords if this
[48:54.120 --> 48:59.720]  system can't detect it now if the next generation system will just imagine being being to hang out
[48:59.720 --> 49:04.360]  on the street with your friends and just talking about a political issue and several keywords
[49:04.920 --> 49:11.320]  come up uh that in the conversation and this system can detect that and all of a sudden it's
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.880]  going to start looking at you closer it's going to take your picture put you into a database
[49:16.440 --> 49:21.880]  this is the new world order and this is right around the corner it's not only around the
[49:21.880 --> 49:26.280]  corner it's here and i want to talk about how they talk to you how they talk to the populace
[49:26.280 --> 49:33.560]  the general public out there they say cash prizes as if it's a game show they want you to associate
[49:33.560 --> 49:39.080]  those endorphins with that game show that winning mentality and of course money makes us feel good
[49:39.080 --> 49:43.640]  so it's a cash prize when you turn in your neighbor but it's not really your neighbor
[49:43.640 --> 49:48.440]  they're on the other side of town or they're in a different county or they're you know 200 miles away
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.320]  but what they want to create and super create because hillar created this type of a society
[49:53.320 --> 49:59.000]  where stasi forces tattle tail on one another and you don't know who the government informant is
[49:59.000 --> 50:04.120]  because you all become the government informants your 12 year old is going to be sitting on these
[50:04.120 --> 50:08.440]  computers instead of an allowance he's going to be be like oh i can make 20 or 30 or maybe
[50:08.440 --> 50:15.560]  200 or 300 dollars if i man the cameras for a few days it's insane to me mark there was a presentation
[50:15.560 --> 50:20.600]  you can probably find this on the internet by a man named jesse shell who used to work as a creative
[50:20.600 --> 50:28.600]  director for disney and this was at the 2010 they called the dice summit at the design initiative
[50:28.600 --> 50:34.920]  communication entertain summit at the summit of video game executives talking about the future of
[50:34.920 --> 50:40.280]  video game and right there because we also go into the future of video gaming and how they
[50:40.280 --> 50:45.640]  want to microchip you in the future with these systems i'm not making it up that's a step beyond

[54:15.400 --> 54:20.920]  empire a new world order to find us the alex joneshow i am jason bermas sitting in and finish
[54:20.920 --> 54:26.760]  up mark you were talking about the future of video gaming this is a big shot that used to work for
[54:26.760 --> 54:32.360]  disney and now has its own video game company and at this technology summit he was talking about the
[54:32.360 --> 54:40.600]  future of video games and he was basically saying he says quote you have no idea what books or what
[54:40.600 --> 54:45.560]  books your grandparents read or where they went on a daily basis but these sensors he was talking
[54:45.560 --> 54:50.360]  about sensors that are going to be everywhere that are going to be on us and all around us
[54:50.360 --> 54:55.720]  everywhere i'm quoting him here to be tracking and watching what we're doing forever and he says
[54:55.720 --> 55:00.440]  our grandchildren will know every book we've read and then he goes on to say that they'll know what
[55:00.440 --> 55:06.600]  we did on a daily basis and he concluded his speech by saying that since this computer system is
[55:06.600 --> 55:11.560]  going to know everything that we do everything we look at everything we buy everything we eat
[55:12.280 --> 55:18.840]  the books movies the music that we use he says that maybe we'll actually become better people
[55:18.840 --> 55:26.360]  oh yes we're going to be concerned with people judging us oh yes big brother needs to judge us
[55:26.360 --> 55:33.080]  in order in order for humanity to evolve mark that's the big cell no it's for our own good we're
[55:33.080 --> 55:38.440]  we're not evolved enough right now we need to be watched so we make better moral decisions well
[55:38.440 --> 55:44.600]  why don't we just make better moral decisions on our own why don't we just find a moral compass
[55:44.600 --> 55:51.000]  again love thy neighbor work with one another work against the tyrants that keep taking more and more
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.400]  and in their own documents they admit it i don't know if you've seen capitalism a love story yet
[55:55.400 --> 56:01.960]  of course michael more misidentifies the problem as capitalism when it's really globalism but city
[56:01.960 --> 56:07.000]  group has these internal documents where they admit we are no longer in a democracy or a
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.880]  constitutional republic or anything of that nature they admit we are in a plutonomy in which the rich
[56:13.880 --> 56:19.720]  keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poor and the great divide becomes so great the only
[56:19.720 --> 56:25.320]  thing they're worried about is an elastic effect where we the people actually get a spine mark and
[56:25.320 --> 56:31.880]  revolt you know the future is Ray Kurzweil's written some pretty incredible books about the future of
[56:31.880 --> 56:38.040]  technology of the age of intelligent machines the age of spiritual machine he actually admits
[56:38.040 --> 56:43.080]  in one of his books that in the future he i think he predicts by about 2029 that there's going to be
[56:43.080 --> 56:50.600]  a tremendous gap between because of technology between those who are just completely politically
[56:50.600 --> 56:55.720]  disconnected socially disconnected and he kind of dances around the fact that there is going to be
[56:55.720 --> 57:02.760]  a a technocracy uh elite that that have access to all of this technology that use the technology
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.560]  and then just the slaves that uh really have nothing in our kind of just left you know running
[57:07.560 --> 57:14.120]  on the treadmill slaving to the man as i like to say but i even think that's a soft term a
[57:14.120 --> 57:19.640]  technocracy that implies as though the people have some say in this no we live in a technopoly
[57:19.640 --> 57:26.120]  now run by the military industrial complex that really started to gain momentum in the 30s 40s
[57:26.120 --> 57:32.600]  50s and by the 60s eisenhower had identified it and warned us against it again that is featured
[57:32.600 --> 57:38.600]  in my new film invisible empire we really go over the entire history in a nutshell of the term new
[57:38.600 --> 57:44.520]  world order of its modes of control of those who wanted a one world government a one world society
[57:44.520 --> 57:50.280]  where the state is god where a collectivist mindset is put upon us and we no longer have
[57:50.280 --> 57:57.720]  our humanity or individuality mark no that's part of the plan and it gets so creepy i mean some people
[57:58.760 --> 58:03.400]  can't even grasp what it is that's happening and what's coming around the corner i have dug up
[58:03.400 --> 58:10.920]  actual patents of subliminal messaging devices that have been patented for 20 years back in
[58:10.920 --> 58:17.080]  the in the late 70s the wall street journal and time magazine did articles on shopping malls that
[58:17.080 --> 58:23.480]  were implanting subliminal messages in this in the music system to try to get people to not
[58:23.480 --> 58:28.520]  shop left and apparently they had success but there's one patent here that i have the file in
[58:28.520 --> 58:36.520]  1989 that can submit subliminal messages not even with mark people don't understand the amount of
[58:36.520 --> 58:40.040]  control they're really under i thank you for joining us it's the alex joneshow back after this
[58:40.040 --> 58:49.320]  us america's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade we are the gcn radio
[58:49.320 --> 58:54.840]  network hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[58:54.840 --> 58:59.560]  and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid
[58:59.560 --> 59:03.640]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[59:03.640 --> 59:08.120]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[59:08.120 --> 59:12.920]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[59:12.920 --> 59:18.840]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[59:18.840 --> 59:23.160]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified
[59:23.160 --> 59:28.520]  in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[59:28.520 --> 59:37.800]  today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[59:37.800 --> 59:46.840]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[59:46.840 --> 59:49.320]  this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[59:49.320 --> 59:58.520]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:12.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:21.240]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:27.160]  a power packed program today ladies and gentlemen i am jason bermas sitting in for alex jones it is
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:31.480]  the alex jones show we just had mark dice the author of new world order facts and fiction on
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:38.120]  and now we are joined by bob Chapman of the international forecaster dot com and i want to
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:42.920]  talk about the economy i want to talk about vernaki openly saying they're not only going to raise
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:49.800]  taxes but take away quote unquote entitlement programs that people have bought into for years
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:55.080]  and years and years we're talking decades upon decades and now they're saying no you're not going
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:59.720]  to get your social security no you're not going to get your medicare and they're going to take it
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:06.360]  away incrementally bob i want to get your take on this quote from vernaki yesterday to avoid large
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:11.400]  and unsustainable budget deficits the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:16.120]  modifications of entitlement programs such as social security and medicare less spending on
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:20.520]  everything else from education to defense and we all know their defense budget will never really
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:28.600]  go down they'll just use black ops or some combination of the above bob Chapman well i think
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:34.280]  they're planning another war and so that's going to cost us another it'll probably be a world war
[1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:39.800]  so it'll probably cost us about five trillion and so they don't want to talk about that but
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:45.240]  that they've got that in the cards and that's how you know i i i project ahead what they're
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:51.400]  going to do and that's how i was able to make the call on 9 11 and in iraq and afghanistan
[1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:58.680]  because these are diversions so in the context of budget it what he said was meaningless other
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:06.440]  than the fact that we're going to take you uh from a recession and then into a depression
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:12.920]  and then we're gonna bring you deeply into poverty that's really what it's all about
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:20.120]  and they were even talking about a vat a value added tax and because it's so complex you're
[1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:31.400]  talking about it being a minimum of 10% tax because that 10% will go to the uh of the
[1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:40.680]  monitoring and operation of the tax itself so that's why vat usually run somewhere between 17
[1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:49.720]  and 21% and we'll say the average is 18 and a half and so about eight and a half percent goes and to
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:57.080]  defray other costs and the remainder goes for administration so to speak and so the talkie
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:03:02.120]  of hoka was the one that brought that up again the other day others have brought it up as well
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:08.520]  but there's no question but to fully answer this question i'll reiterate something i've said
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:15.480]  on alex's show before several times and that is i'm expecting next year that
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:23.960]  these countries that have these sovereign debt problems and there's 19 of them and by mid next
[1:03:23.960 --> 1:03:28.360]  year there'll be more of them and they're going to have a meeting and they're going to devalue
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:34.600]  worldwide currencies simultaneously and they are going to
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:43.960]  settle a debt default among nations and this could be the crisis that they're looking for to bring
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:51.480]  in their world financial constitution as gordon brown mused in late february of this year that's
[1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:58.200]  right and that and i just got off a program which alex is the only other american that's been on
[1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:05.880]  there because the um international radio out of the athens which is carried by bbc in deutsch
[1:04:05.880 --> 1:04:13.560]  vela and uh and the french national act network and you know helens scope has said to me well why
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:19.000]  are they doing this why is this happening i said ash your prime minister he's a member of the bill
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.680]  de berger group and it'll be interesting to see if that's edited out of the tape or not when it's
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:34.120]  uh when it goes on the air but the point is this that's why greece was used as a poster child well
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:39.400]  let's come back to that on the other side then i also want you to break down it what exactly is
[1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:45.240]  a value added tax who's going to be paying it how are they going to implement it and how gradually
[1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:49.560]  will it be increased just like every other tax we have it's the alex joneshowe we're streaming live

[1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:12.760]  we are back to the alex joneshow i am jason bermes singing and we're joined by bob
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:19.560]  chatman and bob i want you to go over why greece is the model for the global economic collapse
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:24.040]  and then coming up at the 30 aftermark i'm actually going to play gordon brown
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:30.840]  announcing the need for a global constitution and this is a man who has called for a new world
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:35.800]  order literally dozens upon dozens of times so bob why is greece the model
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:41.960]  because they're very vulnerable uh they should have never gone into the eurozone in the first
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:47.240]  place because they didn't qualify goldman sacks come in and mickey mounts their books for them
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:51.960]  and now they're paying for it and uh they did the same thing for italy as well
[1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:56.520]  uh italy should have never been accepted uh because they didn't qualify either under the
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:09:03.480]  master guidelines and so whether they're headed with this and the only reason i think that they
[1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:09.080]  brought this up instead of covering up any kind of a problem that they had previously
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:15.160]  is pappadreo uh is a builder burger so he knows what's going on and so what they did
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:23.000]  is they decided that we're going to have inflation between now and sometime next year
[1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:28.680]  and what they're going to do is they're going to bring all these nations together they're
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:33.480]  going to devalue and default and then they're going to have a deflationary depression and
[1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:38.680]  they're going to take them all down together there's 19 countries that have virtually bankrupt
[1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:43.160]  and they're going to take them all down together at the same time and by that time
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:47.880]  they'll probably be more of them and so Greece was chosen because it was easy
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:52.920]  now you're you're saying you're going to see a domino effect or you're saying right at the
[1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:58.440]  same time as soon as one of these large nations economically collapses is it going to be like a
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:02.840]  week long period a month long period are we literally going to see an economic collapse
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:08.680]  happen before our eyes in days and then them either magically have one of these global summits on the
[1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:14.280]  horizon it'll happen just before that or they'll create a new global summit in which they have to
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:21.720]  bring in this global constitution either or but I don't think they're going to bring the
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:31.640]  constitution in quickly they have to put the world into well put them on their knees financially
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:37.000]  and economically and then they will be because they'll be wards of the state so to speak because
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.320]  everything will be chaos financially and economically and we'll probably have another war
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:46.840]  going on at the same time they'll say oh gee maybe six months down the line we have to have this
[1:10:47.480 --> 1:10:53.400]  international world constitution and that's when they'll try to ram it in but I think you know
[1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:59.640]  they're incrementalists and what they'll do is they'll lead up this one's got a problem Latvia
[1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:07.080]  or Iceland or Poland and and and you'll start reading about sovereign debt problems among 15 or
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:11.960]  20 countries including the United States and all of a sudden bingo we got to have that meeting
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:17.960]  and then they'll have their meeting and then we'll be in perpetual depression for a long time
[1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:23.960]  now you were talking about a value added tax and how complex it was now how would this be
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:31.640]  thrust upon the people and who would be paying at first well value added tax is paid at all stages
[1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:39.400]  of services or production and so it's a multiple tax it just isn't the 18 and a half percent
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:46.040]  on average that I mentioned within that which the people pay at the counter so to speak when
[1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:55.080]  they buy an iron or an ironing board or something like that before that they tax at each stage in
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:12:04.280]  other words when the steel or whatever the the implement is made out of reaches the gate of
[1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:12.440]  the manufacturer it's taxed and then once it's processed and and it's finished product it's
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:19.160]  taxed and then it goes to the middleman in its tax and then it goes from the middleman
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:24.760]  to the retail counter and that's when you pay your 18 and a half percent so it really may not
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:31.400]  be 18 and a half percent to the entire economy it may be 23 and a half percent or more and it may
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:35.640]  cause these production people to actually raise the prices so the people at the counter will be
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:40.280]  paying even more than an 18 and a half percent tax increase they'll be paying perhaps another 10
[1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:47.960]  or 20 percent because of the cost to the producers and manufacturers very perceptive and that's what
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:59.480]  happened in europe and also right after they uh they set new guidelines to um equalize all of the
[1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:05.160]  vats that they had in different countries under the european union and once they did that you had
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:10.280]  a jump in cost and that's why everything in europe cost so much more today than the cost of the united
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:17.640]  states in fact uh record highs today it's nine dollars for a gallon of gas and uh i believe it's
[1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:23.240]  in the united kingdom six pounds if you will which is nine dollars here nine dollars for a gallon of
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:28.840]  gas and i gripe when it's above three or it's at 450 or almost five when i go to new york sometimes
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:37.880]  but they're paying nine dollars a gallon in gas bob well a valley value added tax at this stage of
[1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:46.680]  america's um problem development will put it uh is going to be disastrous i mean it'll be like
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:51.960]  financially imprisoning people i mean the whole setup in the united states will change and it
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:58.040]  will become even more fascistic or socialistic whichever you want to call it and the the government
[1:13:58.040 --> 1:14:05.560]  will have more and more control over people by using a vat yeah but bob the new york times is
[1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:10.280]  telling me everything is okay this is the headline of the new york times it's a joke folks why so
[1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:16.040]  glum numbers point to a recovery the american economy appears to be in a cyclical recovery that
[1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:23.000]  is gaining strength berms have begun to hire and consumer spending seems to be accelerating meanwhile
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  we have over 20 real unemployment in this country bernackie is openly saying they're going to tax
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.360]  you even further take away your social security and medicare and the bankers are also openly saying
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:40.520]  they're taking your pensions but everything's okay according to the new york times bob that's why
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:47.320]  the new york times is about to go out of business well i hope that's true i could tie to being lied to
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:56.680]  it simple as that i mean this is why alternative radio as well as the internet is so popular
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:03.000]  particularly among younger people whose younger people under 45 well i think it's also the fact
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.400]  that they can read through the propaganda new york times may not go out of business but they have
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:14.200]  to find a way to pose people against one another instead of directing them towards the bankers
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:19.240]  towards the elitists towards the people that are really bringing this and let me give you an example
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:24.520]  this one's out of the associated press yesterday nearly half of us households escape federal
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:29.880]  income tax see your neighbors aren't paying federal income tax they're the enemy bob they're the reason
[1:15:29.880 --> 1:15:37.240]  this country is going under let's start with the people who make lots of money they don't pay any
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:43.480]  taxes exactly corporations pay their very little well explain that to people explain to people how
[1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:48.760]  corporate welfare works paying taxes because they live next door because you're an avoid
[1:15:50.440 --> 1:15:55.320]  well again explain those people the big corporations out there they're the ones that really don't pay
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:16:01.160]  the taxes that and then in turn take our tax money through corporate welfare to ensure their
[1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:07.800]  programs their government subsidized and bernanke's a good example with tarp and all of those other
[1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:16.760]  programs that they bailed out wall street banking insurance companies a i g g e uh g m between our
[1:16:16.760 --> 1:16:25.480]  own is uh taxpayers of the united states and so uh they're they're doing exactly what they want to
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:33.720]  do that is not to pay taxes and one of the facets that almost everybody forgets is when these companies
[1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:42.680]  will take g e as an example do business all over the world they have subsidiaries and they funnel
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:50.760]  the profits into offshore subsidiary corporations set up in the cayman islands and places like
[1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:56.440]  that now you and i can't do that but the corporations can and the last time they gave them
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:17:05.000]  them an act of congress that said you international corporations have promised to create jobs so
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:12.040]  we're going to let you bring back money and they put back 350 billion dollars into the united states
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:18.200]  and only paid five and a quarter percent tax it's almost five years ago now they created no jobs
[1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:28.920]  regular taxation is 33 percent right now there is approximately well let me get the fingers
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:35.400]  about 1.3 trillion dollars sitting out there that they've never paid tax on and they're
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:40.840]  going to pull the same thing again and we allow them to get away with this and we don't shine the
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:46.360]  light on the real problem the ignorant masses out there just buy into this propaganda and that's a
[1:17:46.360 --> 1:17:52.360]  huge part of the problem they don't understand the real issues they don't understand that their bank
[1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:57.560]  accounts have incrementally been driven down the value of the dollar has incrementally been driven
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:18:04.120]  down we've been moved towards a global currency an sdr unit the dollar is no longer the choice
[1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:09.560]  world reserve currency and i want to get into that as well they've dumped the dollar and gold
[1:18:09.560 --> 1:18:14.120]  seems to be up yet again today how can people ensure that they can keep some of the value that
[1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:21.480]  they work so hard for in their lives well it's very simple it's called minus resources you buy
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:27.480]  gold and silver coins that's what you do and incidentally i talked to ted earlier and he
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:37.000]  told me to offer their french franc for 249 dollars and 68 cents and if you do that you'll get a free
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.800]  one year subscription to the international forecaster which is a dynamite deal and he does
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:54.360]  pay for that believe me and that number to call is 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 that is a super deal
[1:18:54.360 --> 1:19:01.080]  but that's how you protect yourself you buy gold and silver and you put it away now bob on the other
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:06.280]  side of the next segment i want to talk about you alluding us into another war are we going to be
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:13.080]  attacking iran if so does that lead to a world war what would world war three really work look like
[1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:18.120]  in this time and age i mean would we have troops on the street here in the united states would be
[1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:22.680]  be fighting a war on the united states would it be looking more like a terrorist war would there be
[1:19:22.680 --> 1:19:28.600]  more false flags in this country to actually control the populace would we see a mandatory
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:35.400]  conscription the bring back of the draft i mean what could i can't fathom what a world war would
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:40.200]  look like i can see the wars that we have in the middle east where we literally dominate these other
[1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:45.480]  nations for imperial power but a world war i don't know what that's going to look like we'll be back

[1:24:08.680 --> 1:24:13.000]  we are back at the College Jones show I am Jason Burma sitting in we're joined by
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:19.800]  Bob Chapman and Bob you are alluding to the fact that we may be put into another world war
[1:24:19.800 --> 1:24:23.160]  how do you think that will be started will be started through Iran and then what does it look
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:29.960]  like I mean Obama and Medvedev just signed this new treaty this new arms treaty so a lot of people
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:35.400]  are saying it doesn't look like we're really in any danger of a hot war with Russia however I do see
[1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:40.920]  a real separation between Russia and the United States at least in the currency trade with groups
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:48.040]  like brick trying to challenge the United States's power that's Brazil Russia Indonesia and China and
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:53.800]  even Medvedev himself showing a sample coin of this elusive global currency that the globalists
[1:24:53.800 --> 1:25:00.920]  seem to want to bring in so how do we get involved in a world war what side will we be on who will
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:08.040]  be who will be our allies who will be our enemies well I think the brick nations will be our enemies
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:15.960]  and the reason why is that they have treaties with Iran and Iran's the one that's going to be attacked
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:23.240]  and it'll engulf the entire Middle East for openness I think the move by the president
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:29.560]  of the United States to have this non-nuclear treaty uh was just to paint in a different
[1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:35.400]  direction I don't think it means anything so it's off the show talking about it doing away
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:39.560]  with nuclear weapons but I don't think they're going to do that well obviously I mean they're
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:44.600]  saying that it wouldn't actually it would be a 30 reduction which is nothing they could still
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:50.120]  destroy each other but obviously there's some kind of a geopolitical reason to do this to put
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:55.720]  these people on stage together but you do believe that if we do get involved in a world war it probably
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:26:00.520]  will be sparked with some kind of a conflict in the Middle East probably Iran and then it will
[1:26:00.520 --> 1:26:06.520]  be the brick nations that we're fighting Brazil Russia Indonesia and China yeah but it'll involve
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:12.920]  a lot more than that and it'll probably go on for a number of years but this is a method of
[1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:18.840]  distraction when you're more worried about your children getting killed in warfare uh you're you
[1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:24.280]  take your eye off the ball and the ball happens to be the problem economically and financially
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:31.400]  it also will allow and I live through the second world war so I'm very well aware of it uh it'll
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:40.280]  allow a government to be able to control people more easily like if they say that you can't go
[1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:47.640]  out on the street between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. well you can't and and so on and so forth so you're
[1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:51.720]  saying that they'll probably even if if there isn't a hot warfare that takes place in the United
[1:26:51.720 --> 1:26:56.760]  States or one of the surrounding regions they'll impose curfews and further extend martial law in
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:03.240]  this country could very well be and they would use homeland security local law enforcement
[1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:10.440]  and perhaps this uh new uh hitler younger type the augulate organization that our president
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:16.120]  wants to put into operation starting with six thousand and I'm sure before you'll know it'll
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:23.560]  be six hundred thousand of these little goons running around the country yeah it really struck
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:29.640]  me very hard and I saw the promotion of social programs like city year and instead of what it's
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:36.440]  supposed to be about helping the community it's kids in military formation doing jumping jacks
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:44.680]  talking about change in red white and black jackets uh that looks a lot to me like hitler youth
[1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:50.360]  in those same color schemes only a more advanced version of it 60 plus years later
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:28:01.960]  and yelling Obama Obama Obama it's so true eating a cult is what you're creating and you know
[1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:07.080]  these young people they're new they don't know that they're getting brainwashed when they are
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:13.560]  and they didn't in Germany either that matter and uh and so that's you know the path it'll take

[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:06.920]  little uh i think about two months ago now calling for a global constitution nothing
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:13.160]  short of a global constitution to regulate all financial systems and this coming on the heels
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:18.680]  of last year's announcement that the imf would actually be absorbing the sec and federal reserve
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:25.880]  as they came into a more cohesive unit under the united nations and global governments let's hit it
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:32.600]  now over the last decade policy network has performed a momentous role in the development
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:39.320]  of progressive thinking bringing us together as one global progressive family and i think few
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:45.080]  organizations could have achieved more in such a short space of time so i too want to thank lord
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:50.280]  sainsbury's and all those who have contributed to the board of policy network and let me say
[1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:57.320]  it is an honor to welcome here today uh the leader of the swedish social democratic party
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:02.200]  monosalon i'm very grateful that she has managed to be with us and i thank her for the work she's
[1:35:02.200 --> 1:35:08.120]  doing right across europe commissioner almunia uh it is a great pleasure to have you here and we
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:12.680]  will have discussions later in the day uh pascal lamby the head of the world trade organization
[1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:18.200]  is to be with us and it's an honor also that we will be able to welcome prime minister stoltenberg
[1:35:18.200 --> 1:35:23.640]  and zapatero to britain all right let's stop the clip right there see right there he's giving
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:28.680]  homage to all of his globalist crime partners and admitting we couldn't have gotten this done
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:34.280]  without you let's continue as you know has been a global leader in development and climate change
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:40.040]  and let me thank him and norway for the pioneering initiatives on health education and the environment
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:44.280]  and prime minister zapatero who will join us later has inspired the world with his passion
[1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:49.000]  and program for social rights his commitment to equality for women and his determination
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.560]  that spain will lead in international aid for the poorest countries of the world all right let's
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:58.120]  pause it right there see he talks about climate change to speak to the well-meaning idiots out
[1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:05.400]  there social equality they cloak themselves as the heroes as the saviors as they openly announce
[1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:12.600]  despotic one world government let's go actions they and so many of you have taken founded on
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:17.880]  progressive beliefs that you hold we have seen apart prime minister stoltenberg prime minister
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:22.680]  zapatero and all of you changing the world for the better over these last few years and we're
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:28.280]  very proud of all that you have achieved we thank all of you for joining us here in london today
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:35.960]  today i want to still imagine what people will see of us all a century from now people look back
[1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:44.760]  on the moments that are the turning points in world history 1789 1848 1945 1989 only in retrospect
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:49.960]  do people see the significance of the times that they are living through but in the last two years
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:55.720]  our world has been suffering not just a ordinary economic downturn but what will be remembered
[1:36:55.720 --> 1:37:02.840]  as the first crisis of globalization all right let's stop right there the first crisis of globalization
[1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:10.280]  these people bring order out of chaos they look for these crises they create these crises in order
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:17.320]  to incrementally institute their policies let's go the first crisis of a world being totally
[1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:23.240]  transformed by the scale of global financial flows by the global sourcing of goods and by the speed
[1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:29.080]  the scale and the scope of globalization itself and it's a world of massive new opportunities
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:35.480]  that i want to talk about but also as we found a world of massive new uncertainties and insecurities
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:42.520]  too what we experienced is not just the usual inflation driven economic crises such as we
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.640]  such as we have seen in the past 50 years but a wholesale crisis that has gone right to the
[1:37:47.640 --> 1:37:54.120]  heart of the global financial system itself and so it is time for us as we reflect on these events
[1:37:54.120 --> 1:38:00.200]  to draw conclusions about the new framework and the new policies we do need to build a stronger
[1:38:00.200 --> 1:38:05.720]  and fairer world economy that will need meet the needs of its citizens in this new global age
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:12.280]  quite simply without radical change we will not be able to emerge from the crisis into a stronger
[1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:19.000]  fairer more stable future let's stop right here a new global age they're always talking about this
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:25.960]  new age that's coming we need new radical ideas everything is new new new new new global global
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:32.600]  global global global global and he's about to announce his world financial constitution hit the
[1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:39.640]  clip are my proposals for discussion today i believe first of all that we now need nothing
[1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:45.400]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system secondly i believe that each
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:51.480]  country needs national growth and jobs strategies that are founded on science innovation and skills
[1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:58.360]  for the future all right let's stop now there it is again he calls for the world constitution then
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:03.240]  the second thing is oh we're going to create jobs we're going to have a better economy they always
[1:39:03.240 --> 1:39:07.720]  act like their solution is going to be for the betterment of humanity bob but that is in the
[1:39:07.720 --> 1:39:16.680]  case is it no it's not absolutely not and um uh this gentleman is not a gentleman he's one of the
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:24.200]  most disgusting creatures uh in the new world order movement uh on a plane with people like
[1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:32.280]  henry kissinger and the bushes and um you know the people don't know what he's talking about
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:38.280]  it just sounds good to them and uh i talked about that today on that interview in athens
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:45.880]  and you know people have got to do their homework they have to understand what these people have
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:52.440]  created and where they headed with this thing he's telling you and that's what greece was all about
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:58.120]  and they're going to lead us into this uh deflationary depression down the road here a year and a
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:04.600]  half or two or three whatever it is and uh and from there on out it's going to be a struggle to survive
[1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:10.040]  and i want to bring uh ted anderson of mitis resources up right now to tell people how they
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:15.320]  can try to survive in this global financial crisis which gordon brown was just openly
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:22.280]  talking about if you want to maintain the real value you worked so hard for the past 20 30 40
[1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:27.000]  years or you want to have a future it is so important to get into precious metals gold and
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:32.440]  silver ted yeah i'm right here well that is for sure because your other alternative is a fiat
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:37.880]  paper currency and every single country right now is resorting to a printing press to solve their
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:42.760]  problems well you know with grease falling apart in the well i shouldn't even go to grease i mean
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:48.280]  right here in the united states the the budget is so far out of whack and there's just so much
[1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:53.720]  debt being pounded on top of debt and top of debt it's just compounding against the taxpayers
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:59.160]  really even if we didn't have a world crisis we will be eaten alive by the interest that it's
[1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:05.480]  going to just consume us and believe me the united states government is to stop and stave off any
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:09.960]  kind of problems they have they're going to go to the federal reserve system the open market
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:14.840]  operation and they're going to ask them to buy 30 year us treasury bills so it can be spent into
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:20.920]  the economy which means a lot of a lot of new money that's being printed out of nothing out of
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:27.000]  thin air no value to it at all and that money is going to be competing with your labor and i don't
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:32.120]  know how in the world the united states citizen is going to be able to survive in a in a scenario
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:36.280]  like that but that's what we're dealing with and there is just absolutely no other way that you
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:41.480]  can explain it other than the fact that the united states government is willing to destroy our currency
[1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:47.720]  in order to to uh fall in line i guess with this new new world order just simply should not could
[1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:54.600]  not should never have happened the united states the people who founded this country set up a constitution
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:42:00.840]  so this would not happen and for whatever reason we decided to ignore it 1913 and we're paying big
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:07.240]  time because of it right now and i just it makes me so angry we continue to ignore it that that's
[1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:13.000]  the thing we continue to let it get eviscerated and ripped apart and become more and more irrelevant
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:18.280]  as the days pass on it sure is and it's taken the country that was once a great superpower and turning
[1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:23.080]  it into a third world country and it's just sad to see that happen but what you're talking about
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:28.840]  right now is what are we going to do about it well uh alex asked me if i'd hold that frank price down
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:37.960]  at 249 68 even though golden i was shot up over 1160 dollars an ounce close to 1170 dollars an ounce
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:43.560]  and i told my wood he's on vacation i wish him well i hope he's having a great r and r there
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:49.160]  because he works so darn hard but we have the frank currently right now at 249 68 and yes
[1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:54.360]  you will get the subscription to the international forecaster if you just buy one that's bob's
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:43:00.520]  international forecaster that's uh bob chatman's newsletter just a great newsletter and i just can't
[1:43:00.520 --> 1:43:06.280]  lay it out for you better than that right now you're buying gold for less than 500 dollars an ounce
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:10.200]  that's less than half of the price when you consider the discount for that subscription this
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:17.240]  coin contains an ounce of gold or a fifth of an ounce of gold so you can call 1-800-686-2237
[1:43:17.240 --> 1:43:24.120]  or you can go to minus resources right now ted explain to people where the dollar is going
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:29.240]  we just see the dollar going down down down and like you said gold is almost up to 1200 dollars
[1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:34.360]  today once it gets past that 1200 mark do you think we'll be able to hit 1500 within the next few
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:40.440]  months because we did see a large spike this year yeah we sure have and and 1500 dollars an ounce
[1:43:40.440 --> 1:43:45.800]  i think is going to be reality before we see the calendar turn i was uh i wasn't sure whether if
[1:43:45.800 --> 1:43:50.440]  we'd see it by spring and i don't think we will unless if something really radical happens right
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:55.080]  now and i know that greece has a lot of problems but i'm sure that we're going to see 1500 dollars
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:44:00.200]  an ounce before the end of the year i must predicate this though too if you're getting into
[1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:05.960]  gold and silver you can lose money the price can go down on you and if you're trying to sell in the
[1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:10.920]  marketplace when the market is not favorable to the conditions for you you might not get as much
[1:44:10.920 --> 1:44:17.720]  as you put into this however i also will say that if anybody had purchased gold in the last 10 years
[1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:23.160]  or go back to 10 years ago by now you would have quadrupled the amount of money that you'd get if
[1:44:23.160 --> 1:44:28.360]  you were to sell now i would say that gold is a much safer bet seeing as out has a
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:34.360]  six thousand year history of holding value and the united states currency has only been
[1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:40.600]  valued without gold since 1971 and has done nothing but slide down backwards and lose
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:45.560]  purchasing power i think it's a safe bet to own gold right now i think it's the only bet i remember
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:53.640]  listening to alex jones back in 2003 when gold was hovering around 290 to 330 an ounce and then that
[1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:59.560]  just shooting up over the next four or five years then i remember not this christmas but the christmas
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:05.240]  before this gold was around 800 it had peaked around 900 and i was talking to my stepfather i'm
[1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:09.640]  saying listen you should probably get into this even though it's going down oh i don't know jason
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:16.200]  i don't know where it's going to go and a year later it's up around 1100 so really there is no
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:21.400]  roof on this thing it's an actual precious metal it's a hard currency it's not a fiat currency and
[1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:26.840]  that's why we encourage people to get involved in gold and silver it's mitusresources.com what's
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:38.680]  the number 10 it's 1-800-686-2237 again 1-800-686-2237 you do have to mention that you heard it on the
[1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:45.160]  alex jones show if you don't that coins closer to 255 i believe it is right now and you will not
[1:45:45.160 --> 1:45:49.400]  get the year subscription to the box you know to the international forecaster i mean you can't
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:54.760]  beat the deal i really have really cut it right down to the bone i'm losing money to the point of
[1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:59.960]  about 50 cents on the dollar for everybody who buys for me right now i just can't go much longer than

[1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:21.960]  right ted thank you so much mitusresources.com is the website going back to bob Chapman bob you've
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:28.200]  seen it firsthand people who get into the precious metals market they have a real future because they
[1:46:28.200 --> 1:46:34.360]  have a hard currency they have real savings their pension isn't getting gutted their 401k
[1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:39.960]  isn't evaporating their social security isn't dependent upon and we may not see that social
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:46.120]  security in 20 years maybe not even in 10 according to Bernacke after all these entitlement programs
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:54.440]  may have to go and we may have to raise taxes bob it's the only safe place to be and when you have
[1:46:55.240 --> 1:47:02.600]  the richard russell dow theory letter 60 years in existence he's uh he's 86 years old now
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:09.000]  saying i think that the dow's going back down to a thousand uh the world's got a real problem in
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:13.720]  front of it and i think he's right and jill grandville says the same thing and so do i so
[1:47:14.920 --> 1:47:22.760]  it's the only safe place to be you've got to have golden silver coins and you got to have if you can
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:32.520]  dehydrated and freeze dry foods and a water filter method of defending your family and again
[1:47:32.520 --> 1:47:36.360]  right now they're promoting that the economy is getting better but they've been telling you that
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:42.200]  the last six months the last 12 months the last 18 months oh no the economy's fine larry summers
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:46.600]  told me that the recession was over it doesn't matter that they're making up terms like double
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:53.320]  dip recession when we're in a depression in this country 20 plus percent real unemployment you were
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:58.040]  talking about that value added tax they may not even go to the value added tax before they start
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:04.280]  gouging prices is out of Reuters strong us earning scene but may be priced in us corporate earnings
[1:48:04.280 --> 1:48:08.760]  should top forecast again this quarter but the extent of the stock market's rally means investors
[1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:13.160]  are expecting a lot from companies so they just might charge you more and again they're giving
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:22.600]  away record bonuses after a 27 trillion plus bailout bob these people have no shame none whatsoever
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:28.200]  and you know the big cuts that they've made in order to improve it earnings particularly last year
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:36.760]  were in the area where 75 percent of their cost is and that's people and that's why unemployment
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:44.200]  is 22 and an eighth percent what does the country look like we continue to do that either so again
[1:48:44.200 --> 1:48:48.360]  what does the country look like with a 40 percent unemployment rate i mean that's not out of the realm
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:53.880]  of possibility at this very moment there are people out there that are very hard up for work in fact
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:59.800]  i've had families call into this show my mom's a teacher i'm a teacher my dad had a union job he
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:05.640]  was laid off three years ago my mom was laid off last year i just got my pink slip six months ago
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:10.680]  we're a month behind on the mortgage i've never not worked in my life what does a country with 40
[1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:15.320]  percent unemployment look like after all they're shutting down uh schools in michigan and other
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:19.960]  states to the tune of two to one literally half the schools are getting shut down in some places
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:27.400]  bomb and that's correct and it will continue and in the meantime they'll go and arrange a war
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:33.800]  and then people will get ratted and they'll go off and get killed it is the trick of the elite in
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:39.160]  fact i believe it was medley butler who said that war is the biggest racket out there and it is a
[1:49:39.160 --> 1:49:46.040]  racket for us to die for for people that never really owned anything to begin with they will
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:51.800]  create an enemy they will induce fear upon you they'll make you feel that jingoistic patriotic
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:49:58.200]  spirit where you don't question anything how i felt after 9 11 how i felt after i thought that
[1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:03.480]  muslim extremists had betrayed us on the highest level by killing men women and children in the
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:09.960]  world trade center i had no idea about this globalist program for a one world order and that's why
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:15.800]  i made my latest film invisible empire a new world order to find you can pre-order it today
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:20.280]  we've got a sneak peek up we've got a new trailer up there's two great trailers out there

[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:18.120]  jason bermas sitting in for alex jones alex will be up in the next hour the next segment
[1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:23.640]  bob we now live in a society where they openly steal pension funds where they're telling us
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:28.920]  that our entitlement program social social security that we have bought into for so many decades
[1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:34.920]  are no longer going to be available for us they're telling us that this is a deindustrialized nation
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:42.920]  that we don't have any real manufacturing jobs in this country what will we become in the next five
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:48.600]  to ten years will we become an amalgamated part of a north american union in this new world order
[1:54:48.600 --> 1:54:54.200]  plot or will it just forgo that all together and be part of this global government hegemony
[1:54:55.640 --> 1:55:03.080]  well i think that um the devaluations and the defaults will bring in at that time
[1:55:03.080 --> 1:55:09.000]  uh the cutting of these entitlements such as social security and medicare probably by two
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:16.280]  thirds for starters and and that'll be justified by the fact that the economy is in the tank still
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:25.160]  and it's getting worse uh the funding isn't there and uh also uh the cost of this new ongoing war
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:31.560]  and the amount of money that government is going to spend is not going to uh
[1:55:31.560 --> 1:55:37.800]  diminuate it's not going to stop it's going to get worse and of course all the jobs that have
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:44.680]  left the country uh have left the country because it was done deliberately to the industrialized
[1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:52.520]  united states and and that's part of bringing the united states to its knees so when we have that
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:57.800]  happen over the next couple of years we're also going to have a collapse in the stock market and
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:04.440]  higher interest rates which means a collapse of the bond market and uh with all of that said all
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:10.600]  of the groundwork the seed work is there along with the war to cut all of these uh costs that
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:15.720]  that the government doesn't want and of course getting rid of older people and lots of young
[1:56:15.720 --> 1:56:22.440]  people too in the wars and the only real question bob is whether we the people are going to step up
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:27.400]  to the plate and say no if we the people are going to declare that ben Bernanke isn't truly
[1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:33.320]  the man of the year as time magazine propagates along with hitler and others throughout history
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:38.120]  while he tells us that we are going to be taxed to get to death and that we will no longer have
[1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:44.600]  the programs that our taxes supposedly paid for for all those years i want to encourage people to
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:51.000]  get out into the streets to become more active to not fall for the johnny nonsense that is thrust
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:57.080]  upon you in the mainstream media of cnn the washington post the washington times the new york
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:57:03.160]  times fox news no they're not good either they're still promoters of war and death if you can't
[1:57:03.160 --> 1:57:09.240]  see that please look at those reporters and children being gunned down judge jury and
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:14.760]  executioner from the sky style by our very own troops the people that are supposed to be defending
[1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:20.360]  this country country from enemies foreign and domestic i'm sorry but reporters that are trying
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:26.120]  to tell the truth are not our enemy so please get out there please spread the word please get
[1:57:26.120 --> 1:57:31.800]  my latest film invisible empire a new world order defined and police state for i'm in police state
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:37.320]  for you can see me at the g20 really getting down and dirty with the troops that shouldn't be on the
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:43.320]  streets in the first place none of them could even tell me what posi common taught us was uh bob these
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:49.240]  are people that were anywhere from 18 to 19 year old new recruits to 45 and 50 year old kernels
[1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:56.920]  and generals they could not tell me what posi common taught us was bob no and um you know they
[1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:03.960]  don't think it's necessary for them to know those things they own they know military nomenclature
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:10.520]  nomenclature and that's where it begins and ends they're there protecting my freedoms we're here
[1:58:10.520 --> 1:58:16.920]  so you got a freedom of speech and i'm like no you're here in violation of the emergence of police
[1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:23.400]  and military when we have the police and military on the streets as the police we live in a police
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:30.360]  state like that of china or soviet russia or nazi germany that's not my style alex jones

[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:19.080]  oh isn't that amazing here it's been in the new york times top 10 for four weeks now i think
[2:01:19.080 --> 2:01:24.520]  and not one reviewer has even reviewed the book well i think that's an endorsement just like to
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:29.720]  huffington post censored your article about 9 11 even though they asked you to write it uh now
[2:01:29.720 --> 2:01:35.640]  you're seeing uh censorship in the book world that's unheard of four weeks new york times top 10
[2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:40.760]  and no book reviews yeah well there's someone there's there's a few reviews on the internet
[2:01:40.760 --> 2:01:46.440]  but there haven't been there's been no reviews by any of the major media no reviews of the book at
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:52.440]  all i think it's a case alex where they feel that if they review it they give a credibility for this
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:57.480]  thing away from it unbelievable we'll walk through some of the things that are covered in the book
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:02.760]  and why it's seen as controversial but you know that's why the mainstream media is dying is because
[2:02:02.760 --> 2:02:09.080]  people know they're acting as gatekeepers oh there's no doubt about it you know they uh i i i just
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:15.720]  spoke earlier on another show and they asked me how i if why the mainstream media won't question
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:20.600]  the government and i said it's simple because if they don't play along with the government they
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:27.720]  get no access to them and if they're denied access to them they're dead in the water so therefore they
[2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:33.560]  go along to get along so that they can do their jobs and continue to have access with you know the
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:38.920]  senators the congressman the president and all that stuff because if they question anything
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:46.600]  they lose that access which is the kiss of death it is the kiss of death uh when we come back i want
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:52.280]  to get into the war we're now almost seven years into iraq or we are seven years in now
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:57.960]  in march uh last month this was the seventh anniversary we're eight years into afghanistan
[2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:04.040]  and there's just no end in sight i mean when is it going to end well first thing i'd like to ask
[2:03:04.040 --> 2:03:12.600]  you alex is what the hell are we accomplishing a bunch of weapon sales and oil you know that's
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:19.880]  the that's the bottom line for me and maybe i say this selfishly but how is these two wars
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:27.160]  help jessie ventura or how are these two wars helped alex jones or how are these two wars helped
[2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:34.120]  the average joe citizen of this country other than bankrupting us what is the ultimate goal
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:37.880]  that we will achieve to where we can all feel good about them
[2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:44.360]  absolutely i mean if our country was invaded that'd be one thing or even if we were an evil
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:49.960]  empire and the empire gave us some of the booty but no we we pay for it for offshore corporations
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:56.440]  that get them the the money in power exactly and and we're sitting here our kids are dying over there
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:02.600]  well you know what it clearly shows me alex people should really wake up to the fact that the
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:10.040]  president date in charge that's a good point because because clearly opama ran to get us out of the
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:17.880]  wars he said he closed down gitmo he said all of this stuff and yet it's all gone the opposite way
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:27.000]  hasn't it it has we're more into the wars gitmo's still here so people should see clearly that the
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:34.200]  president is no longer in charge of the country and then the next question is what do we do to
[2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:40.200]  reverse that and i've documented that the government's provocaturing militias and other groups to
[2:04:40.200 --> 2:04:45.880]  demonize the tea parties in any opposition to that we'll talk about it all with former minnesota

[2:08:53.880 --> 2:08:59.640]  jesse ventura for those who just joined us we started getting into eight years of iraq or seven
[2:08:59.640 --> 2:09:05.960]  years of iraq eight years of afghanistan no end in sight new wars they're expanding all this
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:11.400]  footage coming out of reporters being massacred being targeted children being gunned down by
[2:09:11.400 --> 2:09:17.080]  apache helicopters premeditatedly all of that happening and we were discussing during the break
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:22.360]  that that this points out that the president isn't really the president and and doesn't have the
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:28.120]  power let's break it down well i really don't think he does and what's really educated me alex
[2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:33.720]  is i've been reading i've read i'm in the process of finishing my second book by colonel fletcher
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:41.320]  proddy and i highly recommend both of the people need to read the colonel's books he died in 2001
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:47.720]  if jude but if you read fletcher proddy's books one of them's called the secret team and the other
[2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:54.920]  one is called jfk and if you read those two books it will become very clear that the history you've
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:10:00.520]  been taught is not the history of what's happened and let me make my point here for a moment
[2:10:01.160 --> 2:10:07.960]  proddy was there who fletcher proddy was do you remember the movie jfk by oliver storm of course
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:15.640]  yes he is the donald sutherland character he is the real life mr x the guy that that
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:21.320]  costner ghost is washington and talks to him on the steps of the lincoln memorial when they sit on
[2:10:21.320 --> 2:10:27.960]  that bench and he lays the whole thing out well in real life that was colonel leary fletcher
[2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:36.600]  proddy colonel united states air force and for i think 11 or 12 years he was the top man the liaison
[2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:45.160]  between the pentagon and the cia and i can't tell people how much they need to read to understand
[2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:50.760]  and when you read proddy's books you will become much more clear on what's happening because
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:55.800]  proddy tells you in the books that the entire cold war was a setup
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:04.280]  that there was a meeting that took place at the end of world war two right before we were done we
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:09.880]  technically were going to invade japan like normandy and then of course they dropped the two bombs
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:16.600]  and they didn't have to but in in preparing for that invasion they moved massive armaments into
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:24.920]  okinawa well there was a meeting because proddy flew in shangkai shack and it was between shangkai
[2:11:24.920 --> 2:11:31.560]  shack who at that time was ahead of china starlin Churchill and roosevelt and at that point it was
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:37.240]  determined that our wars were from then on would be fought in third world countries that there would
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:44.440]  be no direct objective that the military could achieve in which to declare victory now look back
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:52.600]  alex and our history since world war two is that not all true that is it's all true that's what
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:59.080]  really resonated with me when i read proddy's books i went oh my god the things he said here
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:05.800]  is exactly what has gone down well let me be clear so fought in third world countries oh and
[2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:13.640]  remember them armaments that i told you they put in okinawa yes it came of those no they were split in half
[2:12:13.640 --> 2:12:19.320]  half of them according to colonel proddy half of them went to korea and half of it went to hochi min
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:28.520]  they were setting up for the next two wars well governor follows through with all of this
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:34.040]  excuse me from the radio i shouldn't have said that but all of this stuff in afghanistan
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:39.960]  iraq and all of it fits right into what colonel proddy talked about well i'm chomping at the
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:43.720]  bit here and i want to sit back and shut up and you can tell us what you've learned but this is
[2:12:43.720 --> 2:12:49.560]  what's so incredible i've known you for about four and a half years now and the process you knew
[2:12:49.560 --> 2:12:54.360]  about gulf of tonkin you knew about the lives of vietnam you were very well informed you've been
[2:12:54.360 --> 2:13:00.280]  visited by the cia when you were governor but it's been a process of you reading and researching and
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:05.640]  now to see you i interviewed proddy had to be like a 1997 we've been digging around looking for the
[2:13:05.640 --> 2:13:11.320]  tapes and i have read over his work i've read his first book not the second one you're talking about
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:16.920]  and then you discover that joe mccarthy was actually right but he was being used to set up a police
[2:13:16.920 --> 2:13:22.760]  state domestically with low-level communists but as soon as he found out the pentagon
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:27.080]  was running everything remember that was what they said was so absurd then they set him up and
[2:13:27.080 --> 2:13:32.440]  destroyed him and used the term mccarthyism to demonizing but then it was declassified seven
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:37.640]  years ago or six years ago that the russian said no it's true he was right and then you learn
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:42.840]  that the whole geopolitical system is a war against individual populations and there was a deal with
[2:13:42.840 --> 2:13:47.960]  the russians to build up their police state they would take over half the world the us would build
[2:13:47.960 --> 2:13:53.560]  up its police state military system and take over its other half and go into these black hole wars
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:59.640]  to then militarize a cadre of men to come back and take over the domestic country itself and now
[2:13:59.640 --> 2:14:05.640]  you're researching that governor it's so exciting well you know the thing is now is is this alex
[2:14:05.640 --> 2:14:11.640]  i have the time to do it now you know when you're being a governor you're governing the state or
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:17.400]  you're working in that capacity you don't have time to do any research because your day is for
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:25.640]  24 hours a day seven days a week just doing your job and now i don't have that job to do anymore
[2:14:25.640 --> 2:14:33.160]  and living in mexico like i do for half the year i read 15 to 17 books every winter down there
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:38.600]  and it's amazing how reading to educate you something i think we're losing track of in this
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:44.200]  country well i want to be specific it's amazing to see your development and i'm not like on some
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:49.320]  mountain saying that because i've noticed your discernment with issues getting into the whole
[2:14:49.320 --> 2:14:54.280]  conspiracy realm you go right to the best sources the best documents the best history
[2:14:54.280 --> 2:15:00.760]  and it gets it's just very exciting governor ventura to see you with a hit tv show a best-selling
[2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:05.800]  book and to really be one of the main leaders now of questioning our reality but but i don't
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:09.720]  want to interrupt go back give people the name of the book again because i want to go buy it and
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:15.960]  read it uh fletcher proudy on record the head of black ops between the pentagon and cia he was
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:23.000]  sent away uh you know uh to the arctic uh when they killed jfk he talked about how they pulled
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:28.680]  the security off how it was a pentagon black ops job we're going to play a clip from jfk coming
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:33.480]  up later but take your time into break with more of what you've learned and how you tie that in
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:40.840]  to all your other life knowledge well again it's a case that uh you know fletcher proudy just uh he
[2:15:40.840 --> 2:15:47.320]  lived through it and uh i i enjoy reading what he knows about these exceptionally bright guys
[2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:54.600]  see the other thing he he shows very clearly which tells you how obama isn't really in charge
[2:15:54.600 --> 2:16:03.880]  proudy shows you that most of the politicians only learn of these events till they're already in motion
[2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:11.480]  they're set in motion by people in the government you know people in the cia at lower you know not
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:17.240]  the high level positions but in their secondary positions they're the ones that move forward on
[2:16:17.240 --> 2:16:23.640]  all this stuff the lures everything all the pretty stuff that goes on so that by the time our elected
[2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:29.000]  politicians are briefed on it this thing's already halfway to life it's already happening
[2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:36.920]  so they really our politicians are playing catch up and and that's who proudy explains in that book
[2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:44.280]  the secret team that's who the secret team is the secret team are these right under level
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:51.240]  government people who are literally running amok and there's nobody in control of them and uh
[2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:57.560]  that you know the cia has its own money now and own money sources so they can basically do anything
[2:16:57.560 --> 2:17:03.080]  they want and our president and the rest of them seem to be powerless to them well that's what ron
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:07.640]  paul said two months ago in a speech that will cue that up it's about 20 seconds he said we've
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:13.160]  had a cia coup since the 60s they're bringing in the drugs we have a shadow government and my whole
[2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:19.880]  point is we have to come to the point as a nation to realize presidents come and go but the secret
[2:17:19.880 --> 2:17:26.440]  teams run by the big wall street banks that set up the cia rule this country and by extension the
[2:17:26.440 --> 2:17:36.760]  world yeah pretty much that's the information that i'm arriving at it's not a nice arrival but
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:44.200]  you know what can we do well um well i've been harping on it for about 12 years alex you can
[2:17:44.200 --> 2:17:50.680]  start by stop voting for democrats and republicans i don't care who you vote for don't vote for them
[2:17:51.400 --> 2:17:58.200]  they're the problem they're not the solution and that that's you know really it gets to that then
[2:17:58.200 --> 2:18:03.320]  of course you have to question is the voting reel because with these electronic voting machines

[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:40.520]  in perfect for surfing so i had two great days of surfing down there and uh... whenever i can

[2:24:47.480 --> 2:24:52.120]  you have a tsunami and then the earthquake but no problems no i didn't feel the earthquake
[2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:57.240]  the earthquake happened way up by mexico valley which is right on the border of mexico and california
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:25:02.040]  oh i do want to hear one thing when we talk that alex said i wanted to word out to people on
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:08.200]  please allow me to do it here everyone out there that knows anyone in the state of california
[2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:12.600]  please encourage them this far to vote for the legalization of marijuana
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:19.400]  it's going to be on the ballot in california full legalizations where marijuana would be treated
[2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:25.720]  like alcohol and tobacco and the reason i'm pleading with people to support this is to stop
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:31.880]  the carnage at the border alex it's awful seventeen thousand people have died on the
[2:25:31.880 --> 2:25:37.560]  mexican u.s border just in the last year i know it's it's it's a war zone it's a war zone and we
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:43.560]  can end it we can end it by simply legalizing because that puts the cartels out of business
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:48.600]  they have nothing to sell them but that's common sense all these fake conservatives say that's of
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:53.720]  the devil meanwhile the cia wants to keep all the drugs illegal so they have an excuse to put
[2:25:53.720 --> 2:25:58.920]  people in prison and so they can launder the money exactly but see we've got it here's a chance
[2:25:58.920 --> 2:26:04.280]  where we've got it in the palm of our hand alex if the elections legitimate out in california
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:11.400]  the people out there can vote for the first step full legalization of marijuana and i think if you
[2:26:11.400 --> 2:26:17.880]  see california do it it'll go like wildfire right across the country absolutely so you've
[2:26:17.880 --> 2:26:23.960]  heard it here folks vote for the decriminalization legalization of marijuana in california
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:29.480]  here's a roiders article nato rejects russian call for afghan poppy spraying nato wednesday
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:34.760]  rejected russian calls for to eradicate opium poppy fields in afghanistan saying the best
[2:26:34.760 --> 2:26:39.800]  way for moscow to help control the drug would be to give more assistance against the insurgency
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:45.720]  then i was listening to bbc a few months ago and they were admitting that the us protects the opium
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:51.160]  to be friends with the locals and it's up more than 12 times what it was nine years ago and
[2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:55.640]  there's opium flooding the world right now what's your take on government drug dealing and that
[2:26:55.640 --> 2:27:02.120]  they're openly protecting the poppy fields well you know look at it this way alex the major banks
[2:27:02.120 --> 2:27:06.680]  of the international banks of the world where do you think all that money get those millions and
[2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:12.600]  billions of dollars for the for the uh heroin trade gets laundered through and look at the
[2:27:12.600 --> 2:27:19.160]  timing of it the last week crash happened right at the time the Taliban put the poppy growers
[2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:26.120]  out of business yep because all and and there may be a correlation there you're talking about
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:32.360]  2000 2001 hundred money these billions of dollars of laundered drug money and that could very
[2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:37.880]  well have hurt the cash flow of these banks and that very well could have been i'm not saying it's
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:43.480]  the full thing but it certainly could have been part of the catalyst that made the last week crash
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:51.160]  happen in a way well there's also the fact that the Taliban was cutting it off in 2000 2001 and
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:59.240]  you had the crash in 2001 yep notice how every time the drugs get cut off it seems last week
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:04.680]  crash is shortly thereafter well you're right on that front again but how can they just be in
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:09.800]  Reuters saying we're not going to eradicate any poppy fields i mean how obvious is that
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:17.720]  well it's the old thing of the way we fight the worst today you know sometimes the people you
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:23.880]  get in bed with are worse than the people you're fighting you're absolutely right uh you know
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:28.360]  governor jesse vinter i have a lot of questions that i want to ask here in my list but going out
[2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:32.200]  to break on this short segment uh what else do you want to relate to this audience that you
[2:28:32.200 --> 2:28:38.520]  think's important well again just to be vigilant and pay attention and uh and question your government
[2:28:38.520 --> 2:28:44.280]  at all times because it needs to be questioned uh right now you know like i said it should be
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:51.000]  clear to everyone that obama's not in charge i don't believe that he is now because you see
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:55.960]  everything that he ran on it is he hasn't come through on virtually anything he's now on the
[2:28:55.960 --> 2:29:02.920]  opposite camp really and it's almost like he arrived there with this fresh clean agenda and
[2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:07.240]  it was like they took him to the witch hut and told him well you might be the president but you
[2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:13.880]  don't run things well certainly plus they financed him they financed mccain no matter
[2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:19.720]  who gets in they control him oh yeah absolutely you know you you look at obama's biggest contributor
[2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:26.520]  was goldman sacks and uh they're the ones that uh what is it the last five or six department
[2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:31.320]  of treasury secretaries have all come out of there and absolutely and then you look at chili
[2:29:32.040 --> 2:29:39.640]  iceland uh you look at uh greece you look at all these countries first world second world
[2:29:39.640 --> 2:29:45.000]  they're all run by goldman sacks people that's the key heart to this group a ton of questions

[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:29.960]  he's for real and i want to get into how did he get his tv show on air we talked about this last
[2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:34.760]  time and he marveled but now we see the censorship of his book no book reviews even though it's
[2:33:34.760 --> 2:33:38.760]  number four on the new york times bestseller list how did that happen we're gonna talk about that in
[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:44.280]  a moment but first governor i got an email from a lady saying effective immediately she's never
[2:33:44.280 --> 2:33:50.200]  listening to my radio show again because i played the gun pod footage from the apaches killing these
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:56.120]  reporters shooting these kids laughing about it and then lying about it later all these other
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:34:02.600]  massacre videos here's the new york times today u.s forces horrifying afghanistan cover up uh
[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:07.000]  obviously we're not saying the individual troops are all bad but pat tilman went over there found

[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:40.440]  we went through this in vietnam i would think that this country would have a little bit longer
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:47.000]  memory of the same type of affair took place in vietnam where you have the the massacre at me
[2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:53.720]  lie you know people and and believe me i'm not blaming the soldiers i'm blaming the politicians

[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:10.120]  and the end result is war and it's so when your politicians fail you you go to war and

[2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:22.360]  course they what they did is not good but let's remember something some of these guys are on
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:29.000]  their fifth sixth and seventh tour over there they've been hardened now they've been changed they are
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:37.400]  not the same people that left trust me on that and so war there is nothing great and glorious about
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:44.520]  war war is the worst thing man's ever come up with and that's killing each other over what
[2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:51.560]  political reasons religion whatever stupidity we might decide to go to war and murder each other
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:59.640]  over and so no we are not wrong in showing this because what's wrong is sheltering people from
[2:35:59.640 --> 2:36:05.960]  it that's why these wars are going on alex is because the american people have been sheltered
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:10.520]  the media is not portraying what's happening over there and they're not even showing the
[2:36:10.520 --> 2:36:17.880]  body bags when they come home well you're absolutely right and you talked about flexor
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:23.880]  proudies who ran black ops in the pentagon that's on record the liaison to the cia and he's
[2:36:23.880 --> 2:36:29.000]  documenting how they made the decision at the end of world war two to attack third world countries
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:34.040]  to divide them to never have an outcome so the armaments industries could make a lot of money
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:39.240]  and get a lot of power and then we sit here and say that's exactly what afghanistan and iraq are
[2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:43.640]  we know this is the policy of divide and conquer we know they're turning our country into a
[2:36:43.640 --> 2:36:49.640]  militarized surveillance police state and it's our right as citizens to say that we don't want to be
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:54.440]  part of these illegal wars that george washington said you know that we shouldn't be involved in
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:37:03.800]  foreign wars well again i guess sometimes a war is justified you know there are occasions you know
[2:37:03.800 --> 2:37:08.680]  where a war you've got to go fight because there may be a tyrant like adas Hitler out there
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:16.760]  and and that type of situation but ever since world war two you cannot tell me one war that
[2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:22.920]  has been justified but you talked about it being a failed policy failed from our perspective but
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:28.200]  we know they're premeditated to be quagmires to make money then it's not a failed policy you know
[2:37:28.200 --> 2:37:32.680]  they say the war on drugs is a failure there's more drugs more people in prison but for the big
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:38.520]  banks and the military industrial complex that's a success oh yeah very much so for the for the
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:44.920]  people need to always remember there are profiteers that were there are people that wait for war
[2:37:44.920 --> 2:37:51.160]  because they become exceptionally wealthy when there's worse thought and these are the people
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:58.040]  that lead these are the lobbyists that get those secret team guys at that level of government
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:04.520]  to move forward like here's what proudy also brings out very clearly he brings out the fraud of the
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:11.960]  cia we all believe the cia is there to gather intelligence right yes well proudy says that's
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:18.840]  about 10 percent of what they do the other 90 percent is tearing out these military agendas
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:24.120]  and creating the wars and assassinations yeah well that's what i have to create the wars
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:32.120]  see they they were designed by harry twillman to not set policy they were supposedly to be there
[2:38:32.120 --> 2:38:39.400]  only to provide information for the president and allen bellis proudy makes it very clear
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:44.200]  that allen bellis and of course he's net deep a member of the war and commission and all that on
[2:38:44.200 --> 2:38:52.840]  kennedy allen bellis is the one that created today's cia this this independent world outlaw state
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:57.400]  that is uncontrollable now even by our own government they're they're on their own now
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:06.120]  they're cowboys where do you see this going because i have a bloomberg report here in my stack
[2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:13.400]  where the federal government is telling uh private and public pension funds you must
[2:39:13.400 --> 2:39:17.960]  invest quote in failed banks and now they're getting ready to go after people's pension
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:23.240]  funds are they trying to push the american people into some type of armed revolt
[2:39:24.520 --> 2:39:27.720]  he i i believe they're trying to destroy the middle class
[2:39:30.120 --> 2:39:34.840]  absolutely and why uh because we're the only country that's ever really had one
[2:39:36.040 --> 2:39:42.040]  that that's always been the american dream is that you can rise from poverty in this country
[2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:48.280]  and you can become a millionaire well that dream is vanishing quickly uh there is not
[2:39:48.280 --> 2:39:54.120]  going to be a middle class in about 15 years i don't believe there will just be rich and poor
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:40:00.200]  and therefore we will be like every other country around the globe and maybe alex is being done to
[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:07.480]  globalize mexico canada and us absolutely north american union that way people are so poor they
[2:40:07.480 --> 2:40:12.040]  can't ever resist the ruling class here's that bloomberg article they got to bring us down to
[2:40:12.040 --> 2:40:17.320]  mexico's level oh that exactly that's what the globalists say uh in in fact there's a clip we
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:24.200]  have of obama where he says in this new world order no nation can be above another but that doesn't
[2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:29.160]  mean raise the third world in the globalist documents they want to lower everybody yeah no
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:35.240]  they would rather lower us down to the third world level unbelievable to raising up the third world
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:41.320]  car level let's uh read this bloomberg headline for folks that are doubting me failed banks may get
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:46.360]  pension fund backing as fdic six cash the federal deposit insurance corporation is trying to encourage
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:51.880]  public retirement funds that control more than two trillion to buy all or part of failed lenders
[2:40:52.440 --> 2:40:57.320]  assets taking on a more direct role in propping up banking systems and it talks about how the
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:41:02.680]  regulators are ordering them to do it since when do regulators order private and public pension
[2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:08.280]  funds to be invested in in in the failed banks and since when would you look at the clear conscience
[2:41:08.280 --> 2:41:14.840]  want to invest in a failed bank well the government says jesse they want to grab your 401k and give it
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:24.200]  to the bankers well i'll tell you alex i don't know maybe they do want an on-the-street resolution
[2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:28.840]  i don't know well i know they've been setting up for it and infiltrating i know they infiltrated
[2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:33.080]  these militias and set them up to create the illusion that there's about to be all this domestic
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:37.800]  terror and i believe they're getting ready to stage terror attacks governor to blame it on the
[2:41:37.800 --> 2:41:43.080]  american people to use north com against the american people so that what they could empower
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:48.200]  themselves into town martial law type situation i know they've been making preparations for two
[2:41:48.200 --> 2:41:53.640]  decades in earnest starting with oliver north and i know i've never seen such a build up towards it
[2:41:53.640 --> 2:42:00.920]  okay well it's something we all got to be aware of without a doubt but uh you know there's still
[2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:06.760]  us all the masses out there and uh we're still very powerful but the only thing is we have to
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:12.440]  learn to use our power well you've got a powerful voice as a political icon and independent a former
[2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:17.480]  governor what would you say to the american people if we see some terror attacks they're
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:22.680]  blamed on the american people and they start trying to use these different enemy combatant
[2:42:22.680 --> 2:42:29.080]  acts belligerent acts to start grabbing us citizens well you know i think the first thing we need to
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:37.000]  do is this i think we need to put huge pressure on the obama administration to rescind the patriot
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:43.960]  act yes i think that would be the great starting point for people to start marching and demanding
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:51.400]  that the patriot act be abolished that's a good the patriot act is the thing that's taken away
[2:42:51.400 --> 2:42:57.400]  our freedoms it's taking away habeas corpus where they can arrest you simply say you committed a
[2:42:57.400 --> 2:43:02.920]  terrorist act you can't get a lawyer they could hold you without a trial and people in this country
[2:43:02.920 --> 2:43:08.760]  better wake up because what they're doing to them guys at guantanamo down at gitmo they could do to
[2:43:08.760 --> 2:43:14.920]  you well that's what the belligerent act states that john mccain's introduced and lindsay graham
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:20.840]  supporting it says for any intelligence reason or any direction of the president citizens can be
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:25.640]  grabbed and given enhanced interrogation and never be seen again i'm not kidding i even had
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:32.280]  judge the public cleaned absolutely supporting something like that guys print the belligerent
[2:43:32.280 --> 2:43:36.760]  act i want to read governor of interior the actual passage yes sir and i had judge napolitano on is a
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:42.680]  former federal judge and and he pointed out it says that the fact that you've been grabbed
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:48.520]  is a secret unless the house and senate intelligence committee vote to allow it to be known you've
[2:43:48.520 --> 2:43:57.720]  even been grabbed really well then let me say this on your show alex i will never disappear by my own
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:07.000]  choice good point so i've said it now on your show so everybody knows that if jessie finner
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:13.960]  suddenly disappears they'll know that i i wouldn't do that other than to go surfing in mexico and
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:19.960]  you know that i'll come back every spring well i tell you that brings me to the next question i mean
[2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:25.720]  as things heat up as you become even more prominent if that's possible but you sure you are and as
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:30.200]  people's respect for you goes even higher we need to take good care of you so watch out there aren't
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:35.160]  some frogmen out there when you're surfing that try to try to make you disappear be careful hope
[2:44:35.160 --> 2:44:41.240]  you're strapping a sidearm or at least a speargun when you're out there no i you know when you're
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:46.120]  i've always been a pretty good swimmer alex and then i can take care of myself in the water
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:53.160]  and i truly don't believe any of my co team mates would do that to me now i don't think
[2:44:53.160 --> 2:44:57.880]  they wouldn't either you know what they don't believe that would happen and so i maybe i'm
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:04.520]  wrong but i don't think so and not but uh no it's just a case again where we we've got to keep
[2:45:04.520 --> 2:45:10.200]  talking when when when that like that lady that sent you that thing i have sympathy for her son
[2:45:10.200 --> 2:45:15.560]  who's over there fighting because it's our fault people need to understand this also
[2:45:16.600 --> 2:45:22.520]  we can end all these wars by bringing the draft back and i used to be on the abolished the draft
[2:45:22.520 --> 2:45:29.320]  movement after vietnam but now i realize that the professional military is a mistake because the
[2:45:29.320 --> 2:45:35.720]  problem is this when you get a professional military like we have we the public are then not
[2:45:35.720 --> 2:45:43.240]  vigilant we need to be vigilant to never send those young men and women into harm's way unless it
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:48.600]  is absolutely essential well now we've got a mercenary army i think we should ban that first
[2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:54.600]  and then totally you got to get rid of these mercenaries you got to get rid of black water
[2:45:54.600 --> 2:45:59.480]  you got to get rid of all of them groups of because there's actually more mercenaries interact
[2:45:59.480 --> 2:46:05.400]  today than there are soldiers well i've talked to anthony shaver special forces colonel commander
[2:46:05.400 --> 2:46:09.800]  and he talked about how the cia wouldn't let him kill bin laden two weeks before 9 11
[2:46:09.800 --> 2:46:14.040]  and he said that was being done because they already had contractors in the cia
[2:46:14.040 --> 2:46:18.920]  with more power than the army and the navy and that they basically are above the law
[2:46:18.920 --> 2:46:24.760]  and can do whatever they want so in priorities book you'll find out the cia runs our military
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:33.000]  our military is used to back up whatever the cia is getting involved with well that's what uh
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:38.840]  that's what colonel uh shaffer says you know oh yeah parties present too well he might be good to
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:44.760]  interview anthony shaver uh he's on fox and msnbc and cnn all of them let me read this to you just
[2:46:44.760 --> 2:46:50.200]  so it's on record in fact here's the bill right here racing through the senate right now the centers
[2:46:50.200 --> 2:46:56.120]  to be detained as enemy belligerence the full bill can be read here a person is considered a high value
[2:46:56.120 --> 2:47:01.480]  detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria and it says uh number three potential
[2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:05.960]  intelligence value number five such other matters as the president considers appropriate
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:11.160]  and it says the enemy belligerent interrogation detention and prosecution act of 2010 and it
[2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:16.200]  says they can secretly grab you put a bag over your head and then they can use intent enhanced
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:22.840]  interrogation which is torture uh i mean what's your take on alex torture you to do what
[2:47:25.160 --> 2:47:30.200]  i guess to to say you're guilty well i don't know okay let's say hypothetically they grabbed me
[2:47:30.200 --> 2:47:33.480]  what would they torture me to find out
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:40.040]  that's the whole point they only torture for terror and to get false confessions
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:46.920]  okay so i'd have to confess to something then right yes okay that's what i was interested in why
[2:47:46.920 --> 2:47:51.000]  on earth would they do you know would they pick someone and then torture them for what purpose
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:56.120]  well now if we ever have another big war and people torture our troops how can we say it's
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:48:04.040]  wrong we can't we haven't been able to do that since obu grob and go get mo we can't we can't
[2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:10.840]  you know let me throw this out for your listeners to understand this to alex you know we're the
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:16.760]  united states and let me reiterate my father's a world war two vet my mother's a world war two
[2:48:16.760 --> 2:48:22.120]  vet my brother and i are both vietnam vets i say that because of what i'm going to tell you now
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:28.600]  now we in the united states have been practicing terrorism for 50 years we just call it foreign
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:35.880]  policy yes because we've been terrorizing cuba we've attempted to kill castron multiple occasions
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:42.280]  we've we've ruined their cane fields we've attempted to destroy their economy and have
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:48.840]  it now do you know about this character orlando bosh tell folks about it well orlando bosh was
[2:48:48.840 --> 2:48:58.680]  a guy who blew up a civilian cuban airliner for the cia and got protected but no there were 73
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:07.720]  people on board now is that not an act of terrorism it is well the senior pardoned him yes this guy
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:17.080]  that blew up a plane with 73 people on it in fact we need to realize that we need to take our heads
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:23.800]  out of the sand the citizens of the united states of america and start realizing think of it this way
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:30.840]  why do we have to spend so much money on our defense budget of course after us and for what reason
[2:49:32.280 --> 2:49:38.600]  what are we protecting ourselves from obviously we haven't behaved very well throughout the world
[2:49:39.400 --> 2:49:45.640]  because clearly if we're in such danger that literally half of our money in our taxes have to
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:51.400]  go to defense spending what does that tell you well i wanted to add that that individual you
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:57.800]  mentioned we cover in terror storm it's declassified that he blew up a plane full of the olympic team
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:05.400]  for the cubans yeah so so again and then there really isn't many people attacking us so the
[2:50:05.400 --> 2:50:11.160]  military industrial complex goes out and finances terror groups or stages attacks as the pretext to
[2:50:11.160 --> 2:50:16.840]  you ratchet up the naked body scanners and the face scanners and the control yeah maybe well you
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:24.200]  may well be right on that because again you know we've been practicing terrorism for 50 years we
[2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:30.200]  just call it foreign policy you know i mean look at all the look at all the people we've tried to
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:36.760]  assassinate down in central america that's not terrorism when you go in and attempt just because
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:43.080]  a country has a different form of government than you have what gives us the right to go into that
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:48.360]  country and attempt to assassinate their leader well if they tried it here they'd be called terrorist
[2:50:48.360 --> 2:50:53.000]  i'm skipping this network break we got about nine minutes left with jessie ventura this is a network

[2:52:18.280 --> 2:52:27.320]  they they are allowing me to go back after jfk so we will be taking one trip back to the past
[2:52:27.960 --> 2:52:34.200]  and uh we were going to unleash some probably new things on the john f kennedy assassination
[2:52:34.200 --> 2:52:39.400]  that i don't believe anybody else and if and if we're successful on one of the things we do
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:45.960]  it will completely show that it was a that that it was a conspiracy and that oswald did not act
[2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:52.600]  alone amazing and that's all i'll say for now because i don't care go any farther well if you
[2:52:52.600 --> 2:52:57.320]  don't know the if you don't know the past you're not going to know the future exactly and you know
[2:52:57.320 --> 2:53:03.960]  and then uh other other things that are are on the radar screen are you familiar with this plum island
[2:53:04.600 --> 2:53:08.920]  oh biological weapons zoological weapons laboratory off the coast of new york where we
[2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:14.440]  got Lyme disease and so much more now they've built 36 of these in major cities yeah well we're
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:19.720]  that that's out that's on the screen right now and there's a few other good ones and again we're
[2:53:19.720 --> 2:53:26.440]  just paring them down now we'll probably see what happens is this third tv will start off and they'll
[2:53:26.440 --> 2:53:32.280]  approve like two or three of them so we'll go ahead and begin working on them then in the process
[2:53:32.280 --> 2:53:38.600]  of working on them other approvals will come for the other shows yeah and so then don't that then
[2:53:38.600 --> 2:53:44.840]  the staff will start ramping up for those shows also that what gets confusing in doing the shows
[2:53:44.840 --> 2:53:51.160]  is that sometimes we'll be doing three of them at one time well you guys aren't half-assing this
[2:53:51.160 --> 2:53:56.200]  either you do a lot of research a lot of work a lot goes into this television show well i'll tell
[2:53:56.200 --> 2:54:05.080]  you for our for our for our little purse string budget that we're we do a hell of a job because
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:11.240]  you know what i actually didn't in negotiations this year what i was already locked in for the
[2:54:11.240 --> 2:54:16.920]  second season so i couldn't negotiate money at all but i couldn't negotiate artistically
[2:54:17.640 --> 2:54:23.960]  i told i told my top agent that william morris has said look i said i want it in writing
[2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:28.520]  that this year will actually get a set of clappers for when we're out on the streets
[2:54:28.520 --> 2:54:35.720]  what clappers are now right uh to tell me well they're those little boards you see in hollywood
[2:54:35.720 --> 2:54:40.120]  with the clickers in front of the camera what scene it is blah blah blah and then they clap
[2:54:40.120 --> 2:54:47.640]  then yes you can separate all your shoots well we were so cheap in doing this thing initially
[2:54:47.640 --> 2:54:54.680]  we had to use our hands i remember yeah the clap and so i told them i said look the only thing i
[2:54:54.680 --> 2:55:01.400]  demand is that i want it in writing that we will have a clapper sent out shoots and it was funny
[2:55:01.400 --> 2:55:08.280]  because my top agent that william morris is laughing and he said governor i can assure you we i'll
[2:55:08.280 --> 2:55:16.040]  take it out of our end you will have a clapper this year man i tell you and you spent so much time
[2:55:16.040 --> 2:55:21.880]  what six months of work or more over a year making the last television program so when will we see
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:29.000]  this air uh in the in the fall of this year i can't even venture a guess right now because again it'll
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:34.840]  depend on how many of them they want done and in the camp and how many and at what point are we
[2:55:34.840 --> 2:55:40.600]  out to finish up whatever is left before they because once they make the decision to start airing
[2:55:40.600 --> 2:55:46.360]  them i've got a feeling they're going to want to have the majority of them done so that they can air
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:51.560]  them weekly like they did last time we're 10 weeks in a row you will get a different conspiracy every
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:56:05.640]  week well i look forward to seeing you again in person you're so great so is your son and the
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:10.920]  whole crew the book is american conspiracies available at info wars dot com and everywhere
[2:56:10.920 --> 2:56:18.600]  else but we have it discounted with a free film at info wars dot com or by calling 8882533139
[2:56:18.600 --> 2:56:24.360]  governor ventura in closing we got about three minutes left here studying the new world order
[2:56:24.360 --> 2:56:30.440]  studying the global elite studying these shadowy organizations what has it been like your your
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:36.440]  your immersion in this and and what is your model now of who's running the world and what their agenda
[2:56:36.440 --> 2:56:42.760]  is well i still don't know exactly who is you know if you're asking me to name names i can't
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:48.520]  do that even fletcher probably can't do it now but what their agenda is well to me the agenda is simple
[2:56:48.520 --> 2:56:54.520]  and it seems clear to me uh... ever since 9-11 it's been an agenda to take away our freedoms
[2:56:55.800 --> 2:57:00.440]  slavery you can leave it right at that because slavery the most dangerous thing i've seen that
[2:57:00.440 --> 2:57:07.080]  have come out of all of this crap in the last 10 years is the fact that they suspended habeas corpus
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:12.280]  they've literally shredded the fourth amendment of illegal search and seizure every person in
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:19.000]  america needs to understand that every phone call you make and every email you send the government
[2:57:19.000 --> 2:57:25.640]  has the capability to be dropping that now are they doing it all of them of course not but they
[2:57:25.640 --> 2:57:32.200]  have the ability and they have the and they have the assurance that they can do it because apparently
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:38.200]  our constant you know it's the kind of interesting alex is this i now understand why they eradicate
[2:57:38.200 --> 2:57:45.160]  marihuana you know i can understand that why because our constitution bill of rights are
[2:57:45.160 --> 2:57:53.320]  and the flag are made of marihuana that's true did you damn right it's true all the originals are
[2:57:53.320 --> 2:58:00.040]  him they were made out of marihuana the constitution the bill of rights and betsey ross's flag
[2:58:01.800 --> 2:58:06.920]  and so it doesn't surprise me that they want to eradicate marihuana because they're eradicating
[2:58:06.920 --> 2:58:12.040]  our constitution they're eradicating our bill of rights and they've certainly eradicated the flag
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:16.920]  in my opinion governor i'm going to say bye to you as soon as the show ends here in about 30 seconds
[2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:20.680]  but i really want to thank you for coming on congratulations for doing it your way telling

[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:28.280]  dr paul craig roberts former editor of the wall street journal the father of ergonomics the head
[3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:33.000]  of policy department treasury under reagan the best-selling author syndicated columnist about
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:39.080]  a week and a half ago wrote this article goodbye truth has fallen and taken liberty with it and
[3:00:39.080 --> 3:00:43.320]  he said he'll do a few more interviews in fact he wants to come on tax day to talk about the slavery

[3:00:50.360 --> 3:00:54.760]  here with us today to talk about a host of issues in fact he's got a list of things
[3:00:54.760 --> 3:00:59.320]  he wants to talk about and why he is saying sayonara and then we're going to get into
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:06.760]  vulgar carbon tax vat should be on the table on top of the income tax we'll be discussing that
[3:01:06.760 --> 3:01:12.120]  with dr paul craig roberts doc good to have you here with us all right alex well you've got the
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:16.760]  floor i mean why are you leaving why have you made this decision we're gonna we're gonna walk
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:22.760]  through it it says remind alex that he wants to ask me about uh 9 11 murrow office bombing
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:28.040]  waco operation northwoods jfk and we'll talk about the economy and the dying superpower so here you
[3:01:28.040 --> 3:01:37.160]  are you got the floor well alex you you'd wanted me to explain why i was stopping column and uh
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:42.920]  basically a bunch of things just came together one is i'm just tired i've been trying to save
[3:01:42.920 --> 3:01:49.960]  the country all my life um the main thing is though i think i came to the conclusion that
[3:01:50.680 --> 3:01:59.960]  that it's it's futile uh to write about what's happening to you know write about the wars and
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  the police state the lack of our civil liberties as long as the event that set those in motion
[3:02:10.600 --> 3:02:19.400]  itself can't be analyzed and of course we talk about now 11 so it dawned on me that sites of
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:30.840]  which i was sort of a uh a favorite uh columnist like anti-war dot com a counter punch um where
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:41.400]  i had a big following that neither side for example would would let me uh even present
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:53.080]  facts or even present the evidence that the uh scientists who uh claimed to have found nanothermite
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:03:03.400]  in the residue of the world trade senate house uh they wouldn't even let me report that there were
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:12.200]  a thousand architects and engineers who had sent a petition to congress demanding an investigation
[3:03:12.200 --> 3:03:20.360]  and so it made me realize that uh here were sites totally opposed to the war totally opposed to the
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:25.800]  police state and the loss of our civil liberties that sites who don't believe a word the government
[3:03:25.800 --> 3:03:34.840]  says about anything except 9 11 i got to thinking well what is the point of this how can you
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:44.760]  um oppose the government when you give it the grounds on which it's acting so i came to
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:51.320]  conclusion that since 9 11 since it cannot be discussed except you know in a few places like
[3:03:51.320 --> 3:04:03.560]  your site and and since people uh believe that they were attacked by muslims and that we have to
[3:04:03.560 --> 3:04:09.000]  have police state powers to protect us from more attacks there really nothing can be done
[3:04:09.800 --> 3:04:18.280]  and so i said it's futile and and and pointless and then about that time i saw uh the latest poll
[3:04:18.280 --> 3:04:28.120]  that said 59 of the emerging people has three-fifths of the population uh are ready to go to war with
[3:04:28.120 --> 3:04:38.040]  iran uh if they don't stop their uh peaceful uh nuclear energy program and i got to thinking well
[3:04:39.240 --> 3:04:46.200]  how can people come to this conclusion they've been lied to about weapons of mass destruction
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:52.600]  okay everything well doc stay there we got a break we're gonna come back and discuss this fact that
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:04:56.360]  99 percent of the time the government's lying we know they're involved in every form of evil you

[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:16.840]  dr paul craig roberts is with us if you just joined us for the rest of the hour
[3:08:16.840 --> 3:08:22.120]  we've got to do this interview and then one on tax day with us and then uh bow out perhaps
[3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:27.080]  forever he's not writing his column anymore he's been writing two a week for a very long time
[3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:32.840]  due to uh so much censorship out there in the median things he's coming to this radio show
[3:08:32.840 --> 3:08:37.800]  because we don't censor anything we tell the truth justice be done may the heavens fall
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:42.760]  okay you were getting into the fact that we've been lied to so much so why do we believe the
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:48.600]  story with about 9-11 go ahead yeah you know it's an unbelievable story in fact you know if you
[3:08:48.600 --> 3:08:56.200]  just look anybody that looks at the world trade center towers for 15 seconds you realize these
[3:08:56.200 --> 3:09:01.320]  are not buildings falling down there's no sign of a building falling down they're blowing up
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:06.920]  and anybody that looks at it 15 seconds should be able to see the difference between a building
[3:09:06.920 --> 3:09:13.160]  that's falling down one's blowing up and so americans can't even use their eyes you see what i'm
[3:09:13.160 --> 3:09:20.280]  saying and then we have this fantasy figure shake mohammed now uh you know they said that uh
[3:09:20.920 --> 3:09:29.240]  bin laden was responsible but uh now it's this shake mohammed the guy they waterboarded 183
[3:09:29.240 --> 3:09:34.920]  times until he finally confessed to being the mastermind of 9-11 and if you look at this it
[3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:44.360]  makes no sense because uh look at this guy's feet shake mohammed outwitted all 16 u.s. intelligence
[3:09:44.360 --> 3:09:51.000]  agencies along with those of all u.s. allies including israel's most thought so no intelligent
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:57.880]  service on on earth nor all of them combined was a match for shake mohammed he outwitted the national
[3:09:57.880 --> 3:10:04.040]  security council dick cheney the pentagon state department nor rent u.s. air force air traffic
[3:10:04.040 --> 3:10:10.120]  control he caused airport security to fail four times in one morning he caused the state of the
[3:10:10.120 --> 3:10:18.200]  art air defenses of the pentagon to fail he he had people who couldn't find planes pulling off
[3:10:18.200 --> 3:10:27.640]  fantastic flight feats he was able to do all of these things now he he's more of a superhero
[3:10:27.640 --> 3:10:36.360]  than v in that movie v for vendetta nobody can do things like that nobody could pull off an
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:41.880]  operation like that that's just fantasy beyond fantasy and yet people have fallen for this
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:50.840]  so you realize you really just can't help people they can't think they can't see their own eyes now
[3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:56.760]  what also happens when you try to raise these questions with people even tells you people
[3:10:56.760 --> 3:11:04.440]  they say oh our government would never kill its own citizens oh yeah what about waco the branch
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:10.600]  dividend to a hundred men women and children that the government murdered no one was ever held
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:19.000]  accountable but they say oh well it was all the branch the billions bought but the government
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:25.960]  would never have a plot like 9-11 what about operation northwards anybody can read about
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:35.400]  this this was a a plan designed by the joint chief of staff general lineman limitzer it was released
[3:11:36.360 --> 3:11:44.120]  by the warren commission after the kennedy report it's available online but it's available in the
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:50.200]  national security archives you can read about in wikipedia it's everywhere here was an official
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:12:00.520]  plot by united states military and various black off groups in the government to gun down american
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:12.920]  citizens in miami in washington dc to blow up boats of cuban refugees to fabricate
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:21.160]  uh a crash to airliners and to blame it all on castros so they could invade cuba this is
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:28.920]  a known thing that that uh we were prepared to do and this was you know like 60 a more this was
[3:12:28.920 --> 3:12:39.400]  what 40 50 years ago when we allegedly were still somewhat of a of a freedom and democracy country
[3:12:39.400 --> 3:12:45.560]  and they were willing to do that then in kennedy of course uh fired limitzer and a lot of people
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:12:52.280]  believe that's why kennedy was assassinated and then we have this very curious murrah office
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:13:00.040]  building bombing Oklahoma city bombing that was penned on mack bay with his truck for a lot of
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:10.760]  bomb well in general part it was head of air force munitions spent his life developing testing
[3:13:10.760 --> 3:13:21.640]  explosives for the air force he put out a very big report in which he said that that that building
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:28.760]  was blown up from the inside out and it most certainly was not blown up by truck bomb the truck
[3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:38.440]  bomb of that sort 60 feet away couldn't possibly have done the damage and produced the uh the
[3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:45.080]  outward explosions and their structural damage to those reinforced concrete columns so
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:52.680]  he was a real expert who put it on the line they had no impact whatsoever
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:14:01.080]  uh he sent it to the congress he tried to talk to them it was just all deep six
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:12.920]  so what you have is a situation where it's impossible for experts even to bring facts
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:19.160]  not just the public attention but to the attention of people in government who are supposed to be
[3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:24.840]  overseeing the government such as the various congressional committee so when you have that
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:32.920]  type of a of a situation you know what what has become of truth it simply disappeared you can't
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:42.200]  it hasn't it can't even get into the arena where various material interests operate
[3:14:42.200 --> 3:14:52.680]  and so you have to ask yourself what are these columns for the people fall for anything they
[3:14:52.680 --> 3:15:01.160]  must absurd explanations and fantasies they accept as if they were actually real and yet
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:09.560]  they're completely deaf to experts the facts and so you can't help them and so that's really
[3:15:09.560 --> 3:15:15.640]  the main reason I quit at during the column I just came to the conclusion it was it was
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:23.400]  futile and the people are just so gullible well doctor let me throw something in here but I mean
[3:15:23.400 --> 3:15:29.480]  we don't need to lose all hope uh it did take time to expose Oklahoma City columns further back
[3:15:29.480 --> 3:15:34.920]  were blown off with blast points uh then columns right up beside the truck bomb that weren't even
[3:15:34.920 --> 3:15:40.040]  damaged part and pointed that out the local news showed them removing the bombs the governor said
[3:15:40.040 --> 3:15:45.720]  that were unexploded bombs inside the batf showed up and told medical workers patch us up like we
[3:15:45.720 --> 3:15:51.080]  were here minutes after it happened lying saying they were on the ninth floor Terrence Yakey a
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:55.400]  local police officer that was a hero carried people out said it was all staged they murdered and
[3:15:55.400 --> 3:16:00.920]  tortured him going back to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed backing you up there he confessed to bombing
[3:16:00.920 --> 3:16:06.680]  buildings that weren't built till four years after he was incarcerated and even the hundred plus
[3:16:06.680 --> 3:16:12.280]  water boardings wouldn't make him lie and say he ran 9-11 so then they threatened to do stuff to
[3:16:12.280 --> 3:16:18.120]  his family and that's mainstream news so finally for his children uh he confessed to it but but
[3:16:18.120 --> 3:16:24.680]  it's a process and it was five percent won the revolutionary war or less and just because they
[3:16:24.680 --> 3:16:29.960]  do have a large portion of the public like congressman johnson from georgia who believes that
[3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:33.960]  islands float and that they're going to capsize if there's too many people on them that's i mean
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:38.760]  that you know a lot of dumb down people out there even in government it doesn't matter because your
[3:16:38.760 --> 3:16:43.800]  work and others work uh is really woken a lot of people up and i see a giant awakening happening
[3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:50.600]  i don't blame you for quitting a twice a week uh twice a week uh column but i think that you've
[3:16:50.600 --> 3:16:56.040]  got a fighting spirit you should take some time off but i believe that you're going to be back and
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:16:59.640]  that you're not going to be able to control yourself even though you're 71 years old because
[3:16:59.640 --> 3:17:04.120]  you have liberty and and love of the truth beating in your breast and you know we can't give up we
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:09.240]  know things will be much worse if we weren't here speaking out today so i want to commend you for
[3:17:09.240 --> 3:17:13.960]  all your work and i'm sorry that you were getting censored but uh we'll continue going through the
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:21.720]  points you wanted to make well well you know alex uh uh you say it's public knowledge i mean it's
[3:17:21.720 --> 3:17:27.480]  available to the public they could know it but they don't i mean you know it i know it a few others
[3:17:27.480 --> 3:17:37.720]  north and the people that they call kooks the 9 11 9 11 skeptics but uh it's public knowledge only
[3:17:37.720 --> 3:17:42.280]  in the sense that it's available by the public doesn't know it and doesn't want to know it and if
[3:17:42.280 --> 3:17:46.840]  you try and tell them that you man well doctor let me stop you again you know you use a poll of
[3:17:46.840 --> 3:17:53.640]  57 percent wanting to attack iran they have select demographics they can call i've commissioned polls
[3:17:53.640 --> 3:17:58.280]  before and i know you know about polls been in government and in you know media a lot longer
[3:17:58.280 --> 3:18:05.160]  than i have uh been in the media i mean we've got an angus and read new york times poll from 2006
[3:18:05.160 --> 3:18:12.120]  with 84 percent believing we've been lied to about 9 11 and so uh i don't trust some of these polls
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:17.720]  we're seeing well i agree with the polls could actually never even occur i mean i could see that
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:25.320]  uh the cia or some government agency the Pentagon goes to polls and say here's a bunch of money
[3:18:25.320 --> 3:18:31.640]  give us this result here's the result and that's entirely possible i mean i think as i said my sound
[3:18:31.640 --> 3:18:38.600]  off article money has replaced everything and uh people will do anything for money live sheets
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:45.800]  deal and they do all the time and so you're completely right uh but let's assume that
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:52.920]  that people do know uh they still do nothing about it they've got no way of doing anything about it
[3:18:53.640 --> 3:19:01.160]  the government doesn't represent them doesn't listen to them uh in in every sense they become
[3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:09.880]  irrelevant the government represents the powerful-minded interest groups that finance the political
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:19.960]  campaigns and so the people are really even if we had them all uh educated and aware which i don't
[3:19:19.960 --> 3:19:30.200]  think we do um still there's nothing short of arming themselves and rebellion that there's no
[3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:35.400]  way they can impact or influence the government because paying attention to them because care left
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:45.480]  about the people was having told them what they think so it is a pretty bad uh situation stay there
[3:19:45.480 --> 3:19:53.160]  dr paul craig roberts joins us today we're gonna continue going over his swan song final article

[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:16.040]  is afraid we're going to win this thing ladies and gentlemen thanks to the work of people like
[3:24:16.040 --> 3:24:23.560]  dr paul craig roberts the fundamental situation we face is a decadent entertainment drunk culture
[3:24:23.560 --> 3:24:29.240]  who don't see themselves in the role of being informed or involved our numbers are much greater
[3:24:29.240 --> 3:24:34.840]  than many know because i'm here every day i see the numbers and i see the trend going up but
[3:24:34.840 --> 3:24:41.240]  the scientific dictatorship has set up homeland security in north com they want to push the american
[3:24:41.240 --> 3:24:48.760]  people into violent resistance so they can bring in a full tyranny we must resist we must speak out
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:55.080]  we must deprogram people and that's what we attempt to do here each and every day but they say there's
[3:24:55.080 --> 3:25:01.240]  a sign as you enter hell all those that enter here give up hope well we haven't reached hell yet
[3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:08.600]  but uh you know we have dr roberts is being censored in his uh editorials by major publications
[3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:13.080]  i think talk radio is the way to go and the mainstream media is imploding and losing all
[3:25:13.080 --> 3:25:17.720]  credibility because of the fact that the general public and major polls trust the alternative
[3:25:17.720 --> 3:25:22.360]  media a lot more than they trust the mainstream media so there is hope but i i do think it's
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:27.880]  important that we do realize that we are in dire straits here dr roberts yeah
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:36.600]  now we are we're in dire straits and i still think the people are not aware they're in susan
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:46.200]  and look think think about the uh we covered uh you know the uh you know the meg bay
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:52.120]  oakland city bombing 9 11 operation northwards but just think about the kennedy assassination i
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:57.640]  think when when the black ops groups got away with that that's what kind of sealed our fate and and the
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:05.960]  liberals let them get away with it because with with the election of kennedy you see uh the liberals
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:12.760]  had overcome the eisenhower republicans and we're now going to use the government to do
[3:26:12.760 --> 3:26:18.600]  great things we're going to use the government to great things the american people and remakes
[3:26:18.600 --> 3:26:26.840]  us out in maybe more fair and just and all of this so they couldn't possibly uh let it out that the
[3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:37.320]  government had killed president so they concocted another fantasy story about how oswald uh with
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:44.360]  the worthless rifle uh shot kennedy uh from behind and killed him with a magic bullet that
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:53.080]  also wounded connelly and did all kinds of improbable things and yet all the evidence is that kennedy
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:58.360]  was hit from the right front hit the right front temple blew out the back of his head you can see
[3:26:58.360 --> 3:27:05.000]  that in the films that tourist took and you can see jackie his wife crawling out on the trunk of
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:10.280]  the limo to recover the back part of his skull that you've just seen blown out from the front
[3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:16.680]  uh you know the bullet hitting in the front blowing out all these things are are available
[3:27:16.680 --> 3:27:24.600]  and then they get this patch of oswald and before he can ever be questioned uh jack ruby is somehow
[3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:31.000]  with a gun inside a jail where he doesn't belong he has no right to be inside the jail much less
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:40.120]  with a gun and he shoots oswald inside the jail and yet people still fall for the warring commission
[3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:46.520]  report which has been disproved over and over and over and over by expert after expert after expert
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:58.920]  and yet we still have this sort of uh the apology of of oswald kill kennedy and then even after
[3:27:58.920 --> 3:28:06.360]  uh all the evidence finally forced the congressional committee to look at it again and and you had
[3:28:06.360 --> 3:28:15.320]  all these witnesses who sold a gunman at the grassy knoll shoot and so what does the what do
[3:28:15.320 --> 3:28:23.000]  they do finally well um the congress issues the report well there was a second gunman
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:33.160]  another loner another deranged loner so we have two deranged loners operating independently of
[3:28:33.160 --> 3:28:40.360]  one another both decided to shoot kennedy on the same date the same place now how can anybody
[3:28:40.360 --> 3:28:46.120]  believe these things and yet they do and you're talking about the 79 report where they said a
[3:28:46.120 --> 3:28:55.960]  98 chance that it was a conspiracy well you know they kind of the the conspiracy
[3:28:56.680 --> 3:29:00.680]  sort of well maybe i don't remember exactly right but i thought the conspiracy kind of
[3:29:00.680 --> 3:29:10.920]  disappeared by the by the final conclusion that uh uh it was a second-blown gun yeah they inserted
[3:29:10.920 --> 3:29:20.040]  that in there yeah somebody did it so basically the government seems to be able to do whatever
[3:29:20.040 --> 3:29:27.240]  he wants and i don't i can't say the government i have some there's some parts part of the government

[3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:20.200]  we have a clip of obama a few months ago at the un and he said no new world order can have one nation
[3:33:20.200 --> 3:33:25.240]  above another and people thought oh that means have equality no that means lower all of us the
[3:33:25.240 --> 3:33:31.880]  third world standing and that's what bill gates ted turner the un this is the ultra rich mafia
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:37.160]  basically coming in and taking over society through environmental taxes through all of it and we

[3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:47.640]  one of the top 10 living economists and i was talking to him about kennedy cutting taxes between
[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:53.240]  50 and 30 percent depending on which tax it was and he said basically that's correct and more
[3:33:53.240 --> 3:33:59.000]  money came in the government knows this you cut taxes the economy starts racing but it's the free
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:04.040]  market main street economy and and the big central banks don't want that they want to
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:09.880]  control vertically integrated economy and they want to impoverish people it's the third world rule
[3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:13.480]  where you have more billionaires in mexico we have here in the u.s but one of the poorest
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:18.760]  populations in the world so i want to encourage everyone to understand what's happening and it's

[3:35:15.240 --> 3:35:18.040]  roberts we've been having very interesting discussions behind the scenes i want to get into
[3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:23.240]  the economy but first going back to to violent revolution they've now framed that even if you
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:28.920]  defend yourself when cps without due process is snatching your kid dying core runs many of the
[3:35:28.920 --> 3:35:35.720]  systems in the states convicted white slavery traffickers that's chicago tribune ap if if you
[3:35:35.720 --> 3:35:40.920]  resist them taking your farm you're a terrorist they clearly have set up this system now we have
[3:35:40.920 --> 3:35:44.680]  the homeland security internal documents where they admit homeland security is set up for the
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:49.320]  american people uh so i mean where do you see this going because they're they're not going
[3:35:49.320 --> 3:35:54.040]  to implement any real reforms this is by design in my opinion and i mean where is it going
[3:35:55.240 --> 3:36:01.400]  well it's the police state that's that's been obvious since the you know like the second
[3:36:01.400 --> 3:36:05.480]  year of the bush administration where we used to talk about it if you remember you're now
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:16.600]  when you do interviews uh where is it going i it's uh look the local police now militarized
[3:36:18.120 --> 3:36:24.120]  um if you go to a gun club uh all the police will be there they got automatic weapons they'll be
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:32.040]  out there'll be 20 30 40 50 of them and they're practicing mass fire and what's it all about it's
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:43.640]  it's for controlling the people who pay the salaries so the whole thing is is set up to prevent
[3:36:43.640 --> 3:36:50.600]  any kind of opposition from the population and it's like you say they can they can now declare
[3:36:51.240 --> 3:36:59.640]  anybody to be a terrorist and therefore they can confiscate not just your life and rights
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:07.480]  but all your assets so it's the police state people don't are not aware of this they they
[3:37:07.480 --> 3:37:14.600]  still think the government is there to protect them in some way and i get a lot of emails from
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:22.040]  people who are already suffering these types of infusions where they've read my book you know about
[3:37:22.040 --> 3:37:28.760]  how the law has been destroyed and they wonder what they can do of course they haven't got any
[3:37:28.760 --> 3:37:38.360]  rights so they can't do anything so you know i don't know how much of it is um a plan with a
[3:37:38.360 --> 3:37:46.600]  direct goal in mind or how much of it is just the police agency's grabbing power and of course it
[3:37:46.600 --> 3:37:55.320]  doesn't much matter because under either system uh we're we've lost our rights and it's very hard
[3:37:55.320 --> 3:38:03.640]  for people uh even if they if they're organized and have weapons and to to resist because the
[3:38:03.640 --> 3:38:11.160]  kinds of weapons the police and military have i mean you know they have their rights and so the
[3:38:11.160 --> 3:38:17.480]  kinds of weapons people have are evil and now under north com we have the military everywhere
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:22.840]  conditioning the public at dw i checkpoints at the kanducky derby at football games searching
[3:38:22.840 --> 3:38:28.440]  children running checkpoints on the highways right an armed camp drilling and training to go
[3:38:28.440 --> 3:38:34.600]  after us right i want to cover one other issue before we get into the economy dr roberts have
[3:38:34.600 --> 3:38:39.800]  you seen the gun camera footage from three years ago in iraq that wiki leaks released a few days
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:45.480]  ago they said they've got scores of these videos they're going to be releasing where they are killing
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:51.160]  the or killing the people and shooting the kids in the minivan trying to get a wounded reporter
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:55.960]  off the street and then secondarily i get these emails it's a minority of the emails saying how
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:39:01.320]  dare you criticize our troops this is a war well yeah this is a war that was built on lies and
[3:39:01.320 --> 3:39:07.080]  wmds we go invade the country we kill over a million of them and then there's this droning
[3:39:07.080 --> 3:39:12.680]  brainwashed message that we've got to support the troops by keeping them in two three four five
[3:39:12.680 --> 3:39:19.240]  six tours and treating them like garbage when they get back and it's just this mindless supposed
[3:39:19.240 --> 3:39:24.760]  patriotism to worship tyranny it's it's very reminiscent of what happened in nazi germany
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:28.520]  yes that's right you know i they're brown shirts i've been calling them brown shirts
[3:39:28.520 --> 3:39:38.040]  for years and you've described it uh accurately that's exactly the the situation and it's another
[3:39:38.040 --> 3:39:46.200]  reason that i thought writing for these people is is pointless i mean they can't they can't
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:52.920]  fathom the danger that they're in and uh many of them of course are still fighting the the bit
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:58.120]  nimble they're still angry that we didn't win the war but i suppose we had one and what would be any
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:07.800]  different the whole thing is it's it's it's some form of emotional infantilism they're people who
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:16.280]  are still three years old and they they're they're ruled by some sort of blind emotions that's incapable
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:25.880]  of thought they can't even take in facts so talking to them is a waste of time but well it is
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:32.280]  arrested development they're very childlike facts mean nothing and it's this petty power trip that
[3:40:32.280 --> 3:40:37.080]  they're part of the state they're part of the system they're winners but that very system is
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:41.400]  destroying their future as well and as you know if someone has researched history once you give
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:47.000]  into one big lie that it's a bigger lie a bigger lie and then things accelerate at the end and do
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:52.600]  you agree that we're now reaching that acceleration point where all of this preparatory slide into
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:58.600]  tyranny and corruption has seemed fast but we ain't seen nothing yet yes that that's true and if
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:04.440]  you look at it at the complexity of the federal courts even the supreme court i mean how quiet
[3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:11.560]  they've been and tolerant of this and the law schools and the law deans and the bar association
[3:41:12.440 --> 3:41:20.920]  the law firms wherever you look is just acceptance there's essentially acceptance of this and you
[3:41:20.920 --> 3:41:26.040]  would have thought that that all the prestigious law schools would be on the high horse the bar
[3:41:26.040 --> 3:41:31.880]  association people would be screaming what are you doing you can't destroy civil liberties on the
[3:41:31.880 --> 3:41:37.560]  basis of the hoax but that's exactly what's happening and people are accepting and they just
[3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:44.680]  try to find some way to make money out of it you know well the point i make is all these people
[3:41:44.680 --> 3:41:54.440]  that dehumanize iraqis or afghans or others or the serbs or the south ossetians they have to
[3:41:54.440 --> 3:42:01.720]  understand that in 100 of the time in history when you get sucked in by an imperial spirit of
[3:42:01.720 --> 3:42:10.600]  evil and it's like a team spirit once you do that it's always visited on you it always comes back
[3:42:10.600 --> 3:42:17.880]  the system has a desire and they will carry it out on all of these people that have gone along with
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:23.960]  it and you've got all these well look what happened to his brown shirts the first thing he did when
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:29.640]  he had real power was turn on the brown shirts and destroy them they were all killed arrested
[3:42:29.640 --> 3:42:34.440]  don't you remember that i mean this is one of the key things in the not in the nazi
[3:42:34.440 --> 3:42:40.360]  history that the brown shirts that marched through the streets boy hitler and uh you know attacked
[3:42:40.360 --> 3:42:45.960]  all the jews the crystal knocked all of that stuff all of this this violent crowd the first thing
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:53.480]  illa did was to eliminate them so you're exactly right that's exactly what happens well that's what
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:59.480]  stalin did what stalin did to the bolsheviks the bolsheviks made the revolution so he eliminated
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:04.600]  because they know how to get things done that's in their handbook you know people really don't
[3:43:04.600 --> 3:43:10.280]  know this but it's a fact mal was basically put on house arrest the last few years of his life
[3:43:10.280 --> 3:43:15.560]  his wife was arrested and the communists then scapegoated him and he was certainly part of it
[3:43:15.560 --> 3:43:21.400]  for all of their evil so they come to full power and have giant purges and they even flushed the
[3:43:21.400 --> 3:43:29.000]  top people down the toilet that's right that's exactly that's exactly that once it starts it
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:33.640]  it and then of course the police have to prove that they're on the government side and the way you
[3:43:33.640 --> 3:43:40.360]  do that you you're always producing new terrorists or new enemies of the people or you know the kgb
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:45.720]  under stalin they used to have what they call street sweeps the officers would just grab the
[3:43:45.720 --> 3:43:53.400]  street and rest everybody on the street by the way we went to the gulag wow two weeks ago a bunch
[3:43:53.400 --> 3:43:59.400]  of articles came out the same time about police admitting quotas and not just for parking tickets
[3:43:59.400 --> 3:44:04.360]  or speeding but to just arrest people and federal marshals have come out and said they're meant to
[3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:09.160]  put people on terror list for no reason in the airports and that there are quotas to create
[3:44:09.160 --> 3:44:15.240]  the perception that there are all these criminals right that's exactly it i mean it's out of control
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:22.120]  i think as you emphasize this it's out of control i don't know whether they have any kind of specific
[3:44:22.120 --> 3:44:28.280]  plan that they're implementing step by step i don't think things happen that way i think it's just
[3:44:30.120 --> 3:44:35.640]  people bullies people who won't power they see opportunities to get it they grab it well i agree
[3:44:35.640 --> 3:44:40.200]  with you doctor but there's a national law enforcement think tank council and our day
[3:44:40.200 --> 3:44:46.440]  saveta takes blood without warrants total police state shuts down gun shows without any law just
[3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:51.640]  thuggishly just does it under fed control and it turns out he was picked by the feds from california
[3:44:51.640 --> 3:44:56.920]  brought here and is now the front runner for dallas and this secretive national council
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:45:03.000]  is telling dallas to hire him and then if they do federal funds come in yeah well i'm not in the
[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:10.680]  least i'm not the least surprised um we're running out of time for the economy you want to do anything
[3:45:10.680 --> 3:45:16.760]  on that absolutely sir in fact in fact let's get into the carbon tax the value added uh where all
[3:45:16.760 --> 3:45:25.800]  this is going okay you ready yes sir all right well they're coming up with these taxes because
[3:45:25.800 --> 3:45:33.960]  they have bankrupted the federal treasury and of course the states and this is endangering the
[3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:41.880]  dollar and if the dollar cracks their power goes with it i mean what could really what would stop
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:48.840]  the american empire and its tracks would be the failure of the dollar is reserve currency because
[3:45:48.840 --> 3:45:55.640]  that's what american power is based on it's not based on anything else it's based on the the dollar
[3:45:55.640 --> 3:46:02.840]  is reserve currency so they're bank bailouts and uh their wars they produce such massive
[3:46:02.840 --> 3:46:10.760]  deficits that they cannot be financed by world savings um and so i mean even if the other
[3:46:10.760 --> 3:46:16.360]  countries were still willing to buy the treasury bonds it's just not enough world savings to
[3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:22.840]  finance the united states government's deficit so they they they have the dollar in danger and
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:28.120]  their powers are dangerous so they got to find some new tax revenues and so that's what the value
[3:46:28.120 --> 3:46:34.360]  added tax is about because it's like a sales tax you you can't avoid it except by not purchasing
[3:46:35.880 --> 3:46:45.080]  and if you don't buy anything then you you don't have to pay that tax now the carbon tax in my
[3:46:45.080 --> 3:46:52.920]  opinion is uh it's just another charade that the corporations came up with because it lets them
[3:46:52.920 --> 3:46:59.880]  buy and sell the right to pollute so they can they can turn environmental damaging action
[3:46:59.880 --> 3:47:07.800]  pollution into a profit making venture so that's what the carbon tax does and the corporations
[3:47:07.800 --> 3:47:15.560]  of course are all in in favor of it because they can now buy buy and sell it and the wall
[3:47:15.560 --> 3:47:19.960]  street wants it because they'll turn it into derivatives you know the right to pollute
[3:47:20.600 --> 3:47:29.480]  becomes valuable and so uh that's that's what that that's what that's about it so what what
[3:47:29.480 --> 3:47:36.840]  happened so here we have the american people the middle class uh is essentially destroyed
[3:47:36.840 --> 3:47:43.560]  because there's been no new middle class jobs no net new middle class jobs in a decade so all the
[3:47:43.560 --> 3:47:49.880]  people who graduate from college and have hopes and all of that there's nothing for them to do
[3:47:51.240 --> 3:47:58.760]  and engineers can't find work you know so they they they close this down there's no growth in
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:04.840]  the income of the average american except for the one percent super rich whose income is growing
[3:48:04.840 --> 3:48:12.360]  phenomenally so there's no income growth people have lost their jobs the real unemployment rate
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:22.360]  is around 22 percent so you have all these people out of work losing their homes and now they want
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:32.360]  to make them pay a very added tax so the effect of all this is to drive the people into the ground
[3:48:32.360 --> 3:48:40.440]  it's it's it's it's most destructive thing that you can do you drive them into the ground you make
[3:48:40.440 --> 3:48:51.800]  them more desperate right now you know you there's still some fat in the system some parents still
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:57.560]  have money the kids can come live at home even though they got college degrees but all of that
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:49:11.720]  drains away and so this is probably the first time in history where a government has intentionally
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:20.520]  destroyed its own population the economic prospects of murdered people are being destroyed by the
[3:49:20.520 --> 3:49:28.440]  government that they elect they think represents them and has their best interest at heart so
[3:49:28.440 --> 3:49:39.560]  this is a phenomenal development as well it it's just as extraordinary as the criminal actions of
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:48.040]  the government in creating a terrorist event that then let it launch wars against the rest of the
[3:49:48.040 --> 3:49:58.360]  world they have a term for it command destruction and it vertically integrates the economy
[3:49:59.240 --> 3:50:03.720]  accelerates the power of the super rich but destroys the engine of wealth development
[3:50:03.720 --> 3:50:09.160]  but when you look at moray strong in 1992 and you look at what all these other environmentalists
[3:50:09.160 --> 3:50:15.400]  have said and you look at the head of nasa climatology he says it is our job this is a credo
[3:50:15.400 --> 3:50:23.400]  a maxim to destroy the industrial society and this is feudalism this is absolute despotism
[3:50:24.840 --> 3:50:33.240]  yes i think i think that's true the real the real question is is what can the united states
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:38.920]  government do about china and russia let's talk about that when we come back doctor final segment

[3:54:07.480 --> 3:54:14.200]  dr paul craig roberts moves our yes doc before we get into china the geopolitical breakdown uh tell
[3:54:14.200 --> 3:54:23.160]  folks about your latest book well it's how the economy was lost it tells how the offshoring of
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:31.160]  jobs for example has prevented the growth of middle-class jobs for over a decade and has
[3:54:31.160 --> 3:54:37.640]  suppressed the growth of American incomes and made the economy totally dependent on debt expansion
[3:54:37.640 --> 3:54:41.800]  which is now of course ruined everyone because they can't pay the debts that was in the home
[3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:54.440]  and it also then discusses the whole hoax of free trade or the free trade cloak for offshoring
[3:54:55.160 --> 3:55:02.520]  it has offshoring is not free trade is not any kind of trade it's labor retries and I also
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:11.640]  discussed the failures of the most impressive failures in economic theory in the games that
[3:55:11.640 --> 3:55:20.760]  economists play to hide the defects in their models that are helping us move along the road to
[3:55:21.560 --> 3:55:29.480]  economic armageddon so it is all written in very accessible languages no formulas no
[3:55:29.480 --> 3:55:41.320]  no arcane words and essentially anybody can can read it far it certainly is a good offset
[3:55:42.600 --> 3:55:49.080]  to the kind of disinformation that they get from the financial news well doc in the time we've got
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:56.680]  left um geopolitically with the different power blocks that are out there you were getting into
[3:55:56.680 --> 3:56:04.680]  China well you know they there's no doubt that the United States is on a hegemonic path it
[3:56:04.680 --> 3:56:10.680]  was to be the world hegemon and you know you approach it various ways it's the new world order
[3:56:10.680 --> 3:56:17.240]  and plan the world government and so forth but there's no indication whatsoever that Russia or
[3:56:17.240 --> 3:56:25.560]  China is on this path or would go along with it or and so the question is how what does the United
[3:56:25.560 --> 3:56:36.040]  States government do about Russia and China because they are clearly obstacles to American
[3:56:36.040 --> 3:56:43.080]  domination of the world and now Russia is relatively weak but it has been an unlimited
[3:56:43.080 --> 3:56:50.120]  number of nuclear missiles that can blow us up many times over and of course the Chinese economy now
[3:56:50.120 --> 3:56:58.120]  is in terms of industry uh manufacturing is rabies the passes the United States economy
[3:56:58.760 --> 3:57:05.400]  I mean there's steel production for example there's many times hours there heavy equipment
[3:57:05.400 --> 3:57:15.640]  the manufacturing advanced technology we we're a second rate economy compared to Chinese industry
[3:57:15.640 --> 3:57:22.680]  and manufacturing so how can we shove them aside of course they're also our biggest creditor well
[3:57:22.680 --> 3:57:29.320]  we know how they plan that emergency encourages stand as police fire on protesters the CIA is
[3:57:29.320 --> 3:57:37.400]  admittedly in all the major stands it's in Georgia it's encircling China and financing rebels to attack
[3:57:37.400 --> 3:57:42.520]  these countries and that's why the communist Chinese are getting hopping mad well you're
[3:57:42.520 --> 3:57:49.000]  right that's what the CIA is doing but the Russians and the Chinese unlike the American
[3:57:49.000 --> 3:57:58.280]  people are aware of it and I don't think they'll sit there indefinitely passively and so something
[3:57:59.800 --> 3:58:08.760]  they're likely to do something and both of them have various powerful responses that they could
[3:58:08.760 --> 3:58:15.160]  make to be short of military attacks so the Russians can cut Europe off from natural gas
[3:58:16.360 --> 3:58:22.680]  uh in fact the Russians could could punish severely these various stands that we're
[3:58:22.680 --> 3:58:29.160]  now operating in the former constituent parts of the Soviet Union uh the Chinese
[3:58:30.040 --> 3:58:34.760]  it's starting to cause us a lot of financial worries but doc stay there stay there we're coming
