[00:00.000 --> 00:06.200]  There's a new report out that Bill Clinton collected $50,000 per month from MF Global
[00:06.200 --> 00:09.880]  while Newt Gennrich got millions from what was it, Freddie Mac.
[00:09.880 --> 00:15.160]  This later report from How Dairy You, Department of Clinton Criminal Enterprises, and it just
[00:15.160 --> 00:20.440]  goes through all the reported things he's done as an advisor through Joe S. Corzine,
[00:20.440 --> 00:24.840]  the former New Jersey governor, former head of Goldman Sachs, who admittedly made 40 to
[00:24.840 --> 00:28.080]  one bets, customers' private accounts.
[00:28.080 --> 00:32.760]  Continuing the real reason for Obama's threat to veto indefinite detention bill, Obama wants
[00:32.760 --> 00:38.320]  to veto indefinite detention bill because it would hold the U.S. to the Geneva Convention.
[00:38.320 --> 00:42.440]  And it would give Congress the power, which it rightfully does, to make law.
[00:42.440 --> 00:45.560]  Obama's already told him, I'll kill citizens, I'll arrest citizens.
[00:45.560 --> 00:50.080]  The executive holds that, and his lawyers came out last week and said he may veto the
[00:50.080 --> 00:54.120]  National Defense Authorization Act because he can use the military in America if he
[00:54.120 --> 00:55.120]  wants.
[00:55.120 --> 00:56.120]  He can do whatever he wants.
[00:56.120 --> 01:00.040]  So that's the facts there, and that's now coming out weeks after we told you what was
[01:00.040 --> 01:02.600]  really going on.
[01:02.600 --> 01:08.440]  There's also not a happy ending to Obama's little Hollywood romance.
[01:08.440 --> 01:11.000]  He can't make up his mind about anything, said Mr. Lear.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.120]  He just vacillates like Democrats do generally.
[01:14.120 --> 01:15.600]  On taxes, he doesn't take a strong stand.
[01:15.600 --> 01:17.600]  He can't make up his mind about immigration.
[01:17.600 --> 01:22.760]  I don't even know if he's come clean on waterboarding or torture, any of those things.
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.960]  And that's prominent Hollywood people are mad at him because, you know, he hasn't taxed
[01:27.960 --> 01:28.960]  the rich enough.
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.880]  What do you mean he's financed by the mega-elite, and at the same time, because he's continued
[01:33.880 --> 01:35.880]  all the torture and the rest of it.
[01:35.880 --> 01:41.160]  So that love affair is ending with Obama, who's a nothing teleprompter reading puppet.
[01:41.160 --> 01:45.480]  Continuing here, British Petroleum accuses Halliburton, same folks running Kellogg Brown
[01:45.480 --> 01:48.440]  and Root, of destroying evidence following Gulf's pill.
[01:48.440 --> 01:54.160]  VP is accused Halliburton of destroying damaging evidence about the quality of its cement that
[01:54.160 --> 01:59.440]  came out day one that went into drilling the well that blew out last year and caused the
[01:59.440 --> 02:03.520]  worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.
[02:03.520 --> 02:05.720]  So the rats are turning on each other.
[02:05.720 --> 02:11.960]  Now getting into the incredible Panoptagon surveillance grid, RT interviewed the inventor
[02:11.960 --> 02:19.440]  of the free software movement and legendary programmer and code person, Facebook is massive
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.360]  surveillance says Stallman, Richard Stallman.
[02:23.360 --> 02:26.960]  This is an example of malicious features in non-free software.
[02:26.960 --> 02:32.240]  These mobile phones are being run by non-free software, so it's no surprise that they have
[02:32.240 --> 02:33.400]  malicious features in them.
[02:33.400 --> 02:37.080]  The most commonly used non-free programs do, Stallman sadly pointed out.
[02:37.080 --> 02:42.440]  Now you think an application is one thing, you're really paying to be surveilled and
[02:42.440 --> 02:46.000]  the phone companies and others are making more money off selling your data than they
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.680]  are on the phone program and they're tracking everything you do, they're always finding
[02:49.680 --> 02:53.880]  back doors and trojan horses in them that began with the Telecommunications Act of 96
[02:53.880 --> 02:56.860]  and have expanded on since then.
[02:56.860 --> 03:02.080]  So that's basically what, well the head of Facebook called his customers dumb efforts
[03:02.080 --> 03:03.080]  that they knew trusting.
[03:03.080 --> 03:08.440]  I mean these are just arrogant dirt bags folks, these are slime bags, they've been chosen
[03:08.440 --> 03:14.520]  to be promoted by the system because they are sociopaths at best, some of them psychopaths.
[03:14.520 --> 03:20.040]  Alright now some spectacular news and information and great graphics put together by our own
[03:20.040 --> 03:21.440]  Darren McBreen.
[03:21.440 --> 03:27.040]  But now we look into the limitless universe with the trillions of galaxies and quadrillions
[03:27.040 --> 03:34.120]  of stars and planets to new discoveries by NASA.
[03:34.120 --> 03:41.520]  NASA Telescope confirms alien planet in habitable zone, the potentially habitable alien world
[03:41.520 --> 03:46.400]  orbits a star very much like our own sun, the discovery brings scientists one step closer
[03:46.400 --> 03:52.440]  to finding a planet like our own, one which could conceivably harbor life scientists said.
[03:52.440 --> 03:57.520]  Here it goes on, the new found planet is in habitable zone called Kelper 22B, it's located
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.160]  about 600 light years away orbiting a sun-like star.
[04:02.160 --> 04:07.680]  Amazing information, what humanity could do if we just stopped the psychopaths from taking
[04:07.680 --> 04:10.840]  control of our society and stopped being gullible.
[04:10.840 --> 04:15.640]  Shifting to another sector of the universe, astronomers have discovered the biggest black
[04:15.640 --> 04:20.760]  holes ever, scientists have discovered two of the biggest black holes ever observed, each
[04:20.760 --> 04:27.120]  has a mass a billions of times greater than the sun according to a study just to give
[04:27.120 --> 04:35.120]  you an idea of how massive these are, they could swallow up entire galaxy clusters, what
[04:35.120 --> 04:41.840]  a gorgeous and limitless cosmos we are a part of and our consciousness and being alive and
[04:41.840 --> 04:47.000]  able to observe this is an incredible gift from the creator and if you don't think something
[04:47.000 --> 04:52.560]  made all this ladies and gentlemen, my god can you imagine our consciousness and our
[04:52.560 --> 04:57.800]  intellect and we are tiny little creatures living in a thin ribbon of life on the surface
[04:57.800 --> 04:58.800]  of a globe.
[04:58.800 --> 05:05.400]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator,
[05:05.400 --> 05:10.080]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[05:10.080 --> 05:14.240]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.880]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[05:18.880 --> 05:24.120]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self produced nano silver
[05:24.120 --> 05:31.000]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.440]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products.
[05:34.440 --> 05:40.080]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator, very
[05:40.080 --> 05:45.280]  easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making production fast and simple.
[05:45.280 --> 05:51.280]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[05:51.280 --> 06:04.040]  Silver Lungs Generator that's www.silverlungs.com.
[06:04.040 --> 06:10.560]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[06:10.560 --> 06:20.640]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[06:20.640 --> 06:27.960]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to an extremely important edition of Infowars Nightly News.
[06:27.960 --> 06:40.240]  It is Tuesday, December 6th, 2011 and this is going to be a huge show tonight with so
[06:40.240 --> 06:44.880]  many incredibly important topics covered and normally I would mention some of what's coming
[06:44.880 --> 06:54.960]  up but the news we've got tonight is so incredibly devastating to our republic and is breaking
[06:54.960 --> 06:59.560]  as we speak that I'm going to cover our top story obviously first here before getting
[06:59.560 --> 07:03.640]  into any of the other news.
[07:03.640 --> 07:11.320]  I'm holding here in my hand a document that just went up minutes ago at infowars.com and
[07:11.320 --> 07:17.160]  prisonplot.com and we've called the numbers involved, we've checked the individuals listed
[07:17.160 --> 07:23.040]  in this document and they're accompanying emails and it is authentic Kellogg Brown and
[07:23.040 --> 07:27.400]  Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton.
[07:27.400 --> 07:33.760]  The story is at infowars.com and is breaking at infowars.com right now.
[07:33.760 --> 07:41.440]  The headline by Curt and Emma at infowars.com is exclusive government activating FEMA camps
[07:41.440 --> 07:43.600]  across the United States.
[07:43.600 --> 07:50.000]  Now in 2006 it was in the Houston Chronicle and Wall Street Journal that they got a $300
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.440]  million contract to build three 1 million person camps for political dissidents, illegal
[07:57.440 --> 08:01.880]  immigrants you name it for economic collapse.
[08:01.880 --> 08:06.720]  They've introduced legislation to fund more of this and to bring it out in the open.
[08:06.720 --> 08:12.600]  The emergency centers establishment act last year that got so much attention that says
[08:12.600 --> 08:16.680]  that they will in turn entire families in these facilities.
[08:16.680 --> 08:21.680]  It also came out earlier in the year that the army and other private groups are trying
[08:21.680 --> 08:30.440]  to hire around 100,000 internment specialists when you read its domestic and international
[08:30.440 --> 08:36.840]  prison guards and of course our so called government has camps all over the world.
[08:36.840 --> 08:43.120]  Kellogg Brown and Root has been caught with its main company Halliburton running slave
[08:43.120 --> 08:46.120]  labor camps in the Philippines and other areas.
[08:46.120 --> 08:50.600]  In the Chicago Tribune you cannot make this magnitude of information up.
[08:50.600 --> 08:54.880]  It is the mainstream media's job and other people comedy central and others that make
[08:54.880 --> 08:56.680]  fun of us they did last night.
[08:56.680 --> 08:58.120]  You actually go research this.
[08:58.120 --> 09:05.280]  This is not a joke and you'll be seen in history whether we defeat this or it goes through
[09:05.280 --> 09:09.340]  as sympathizers basically with the likes of Hitler, Stalin and Mao.
[09:09.340 --> 09:11.060]  This is not a joke.
[09:11.060 --> 09:13.280]  This is not a game.
[09:13.280 --> 09:17.800]  And the detailed article that Kurt Nemo and I put together today goes through all of this
[09:17.800 --> 09:18.800]  information.
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.960]  We were sent this by a state employee involved in the program.
[09:22.960 --> 09:26.240]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[09:26.240 --> 09:30.280]  And it was basically a hidden link on the KBR site we're able to confirm it is there
[09:30.280 --> 09:33.560]  on the KBR site and non-published link.
[09:33.560 --> 09:36.720]  And that is in our article where we got the link from and everything else.
[09:36.720 --> 09:44.360]  Just unbelievable information here and it says that they need people to set up barbed wire
[09:44.360 --> 09:47.200]  fences and barricades.
[09:47.200 --> 09:50.680]  And I've been to urban warfare drills across the country with the Marines, the Army practice
[09:50.680 --> 09:54.240]  taking on the American people and do set up the barricades and the towns and the cities
[09:54.240 --> 09:56.880]  and around the camps.
[09:56.880 --> 09:59.800]  Now again I want to explain these camps are already built.
[09:59.800 --> 10:02.120]  They admit they're the old military bases.
[10:02.120 --> 10:12.760]  Now they are preparing in all 50 states to activate the camps with laundry, guards, people
[10:12.760 --> 10:17.900]  cooking the food, sentries.
[10:17.900 --> 10:21.080]  And we've got all the video and photos they've released on the Northcom website where the
[10:21.080 --> 10:28.240]  Army and Marines and Air Force Security Forces, you name it, are all training to arrest American
[10:28.240 --> 10:29.240]  citizens.
[10:29.240 --> 10:32.080]  They're doing manuals with law enforcement of sentence that have been national news,
[10:32.080 --> 10:36.080]  say it's returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr
[10:36.080 --> 10:39.760]  supporters, anybody who basically understands what freedom is.
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.280]  This is like in a science fiction movie when the evil corporation takes over the government
[10:44.280 --> 10:46.880]  and orders the good guys arrested.
[10:46.880 --> 10:50.920]  But of course those movies are all based on real things that have happened in history.
[10:50.920 --> 10:53.240]  So truth is stranger than fiction.
[10:53.240 --> 10:55.080]  Fiction actually imitates life.
[10:55.080 --> 11:04.000]  The more I learn, I learn that I always thought that life was imitating art, so the way around,
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.640]  art is imitating life.
[11:05.640 --> 11:06.960]  And this is so incredible.
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.680]  This article goes over it all and it should not be up to a small independent media operation
[11:12.680 --> 11:14.120]  to be breaking all of this.
[11:14.120 --> 11:17.600]  The mainline corporate prostitute should be doing it.
[11:17.600 --> 11:23.080]  But later we've got a sociologist joining us who's broken down the actuaries that actually
[11:23.080 --> 11:26.960]  when the mainstream media endorses something, people run from it like the plague.
[11:26.960 --> 11:31.960]  We've got new news on the Ron Paul front with a sociologist and statistician joining us
[11:31.960 --> 11:38.800]  in studio, again jam packed transmission, but exclusive government activating FEMA camps
[11:38.800 --> 11:39.800]  across the U.S.
[11:39.800 --> 11:41.200]  They're already built.
[11:41.200 --> 11:42.800]  They now admit they're there.
[11:42.800 --> 11:48.320]  Now they're going out and saying in all 50 states, they're going to have 300 person staging
[11:48.320 --> 11:57.360]  camps, 1,000 person staging camps, and again you can go to infowars.com and get the full
[11:57.360 --> 12:00.480]  report with the documents, the emails, all of it.
[12:00.480 --> 12:03.760]  Exclusive government activating FEMA camps across the United States.
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.440]  Just a devastating, devastating investigative report up there right now.
[12:08.440 --> 12:12.560]  I don't even feel worthy to be bringing you this information.
[12:12.560 --> 12:14.920]  I hope it's not pearls before swine.
[12:14.920 --> 12:20.880]  We have the KBR instrumental in establishing new camps that are now to be activated in 2006.
[12:20.880 --> 12:26.360]  The internment camp service bid arrives after the National Defense Authorization Act.
[12:26.360 --> 12:30.640]  We have links in here where the government says it's terrorism to protest, and those
[12:30.640 --> 12:33.720]  documents have been leaked by good people in the government.
[12:33.720 --> 12:39.440]  This is so creepy and it's so ridiculous, obviously protesting is not terrorism.
[12:39.440 --> 12:40.440]  Terrorists would say that.
[12:40.440 --> 12:49.800]  And of course, the state is always the greatest progenitor and deliverer and pusher of terror.
[12:49.800 --> 12:52.840]  As the founder said, it's the state you got to worry about.
[12:52.840 --> 12:56.080]  Little people can do horrible things, but not on a mass scale.
[12:56.080 --> 13:00.160]  Governments bring you the atrocities we saw, 200 plus million killed by governments in
[13:00.160 --> 13:01.920]  the 20th century.
[13:01.920 --> 13:06.080]  And there's the original Wall Street Journal, KBR awarded Homeland Security Contract worth
[13:06.080 --> 13:07.920]  up to 385 million.
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.800]  That was in 2006 to build some of these large camps.
[13:12.800 --> 13:18.320]  Now this is an activation bid in all 50 states.
[13:18.320 --> 13:25.320]  And FEMA has 10 regions, but KBR, the corporations, they like to simplify things.
[13:25.320 --> 13:28.600]  They've broken it down into five regions.
[13:28.600 --> 13:31.800]  So I don't know what you say about this.
[13:31.800 --> 13:32.960]  All of this is vetted.
[13:32.960 --> 13:34.920]  All of this is researched.
[13:34.920 --> 13:38.640]  And I remember Glenn Beck two years ago saying, I'm going to expose the FEMA camps.
[13:38.640 --> 13:39.640]  They're real.
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.960]  And then after a month of hype, he comes down and says it's all a fraud and uses known discredited
[13:44.960 --> 13:49.320]  hoaxes on the internet of railway stations and things.
[13:49.320 --> 13:55.040]  When the civilian inmate labor camp program has been declassified, the military with private
[13:55.040 --> 13:59.880]  prisoners in them to prime the pump and train the troops to be jailguards, the emergency
[13:59.880 --> 14:04.680]  centers establishment garbage, Rex 84, Congressional hearings in 86.
[14:04.680 --> 14:08.840]  I sent all this to Glenn Beck and I happen to know he got it.
[14:08.840 --> 14:10.000]  And I happened to predict.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.880]  I waited until the day before so people understood that it wasn't me predicting it and then he
[14:13.880 --> 14:20.520]  just decided to do what I predicted, that he would go show fake straw men, okay?
[14:20.520 --> 14:21.520]  And he did just that.
[14:21.520 --> 14:24.880]  I'm not here to attack Glenn Beck, okay?
[14:24.880 --> 14:27.880]  He's done some good work and that's why he got too real and they got rid of him.
[14:27.880 --> 14:36.480]  The point is, is that we don't have time for people to be in denial anymore.
[14:36.480 --> 14:38.240]  We don't have time to play games.
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.400]  I've given you the legislation, which didn't pass, but is the entire blueprint for what's
[14:42.400 --> 14:43.400]  already built.
[14:43.400 --> 14:46.320]  Kind of like they've been spying on us for decades and then when they got caught, they
[14:46.320 --> 14:49.480]  brought out legislation to legalize it.
[14:49.480 --> 14:53.280]  Or they get caught torturing, they then try to pass laws to make it legal, okay?
[14:53.280 --> 14:55.040]  But that's what's going on here.
[14:55.040 --> 14:57.320]  And it's pointed at the American people.
[14:57.320 --> 15:01.160]  And I told you they'd have TSA on the streets running checkpoints.
[15:01.160 --> 15:03.200]  Now it's begun all over the country.
[15:03.200 --> 15:04.200]  I do my research.
[15:04.200 --> 15:08.280]  We do our research and I'm getting chills right now for my family.
[15:08.280 --> 15:11.680]  I've decided to try to defend the Republic and the globalists turn a lot of trouble.
[15:11.680 --> 15:14.760]  They've been exposed for their corruption, their drug dealing, it came out in the New
[15:14.760 --> 15:15.760]  York Times.
[15:15.760 --> 15:18.480]  Two days ago, the government is laundering drug money.
[15:18.480 --> 15:22.440]  The government itself, not just running guns into Mexico, that's been in federal court
[15:22.440 --> 15:24.000]  for years.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.080]  Again, these are criminals at the top and it's time for people in the mid-level of government
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.440]  to say no to it.
[15:30.440 --> 15:33.440]  Nixon gave orders that were illegal at the end and people said, you know what, I'm not
[15:33.440 --> 15:37.800]  following your order to fire people that are investigating you.
[15:37.800 --> 15:39.680]  Just because you're the president doesn't make you king.
[15:39.680 --> 15:42.280]  This isn't the third rite.
[15:42.280 --> 15:44.360]  And it comes down to fundamental things.
[15:44.360 --> 15:48.840]  And we've really headed them off at the pass here.
[15:48.840 --> 15:55.600]  We have, from the beginning, exposed these daftly characters and so they don't know
[15:55.600 --> 16:02.560]  how to deal with them.
[16:02.560 --> 16:06.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[16:06.320 --> 16:09.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.800]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[16:13.800 --> 16:14.800]  at home.
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.440]  We've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[16:19.440 --> 16:20.440]  calling the shots.
[16:20.440 --> 16:25.640]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[16:25.640 --> 16:29.080]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[16:29.080 --> 16:34.920]  The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[16:34.920 --> 16:35.920]  world government.
[16:35.920 --> 16:40.280]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and the arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[16:40.280 --> 16:42.440]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[16:42.440 --> 16:48.360]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[16:48.360 --> 16:49.680]  of the Republic.
[16:49.680 --> 16:55.720]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[16:55.720 --> 17:01.920]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[17:03.840 --> 17:06.680]  You must be scanned and searched before entering the mall area.
[17:06.680 --> 17:10.680]  Attention, you must disrobe and pass through the scanner at mall security before entering
[17:10.680 --> 17:11.680]  the building.
[17:11.680 --> 17:16.360]  Hey, most GCN listeners know that the future of Christmas shopping may quite well be that
[17:16.360 --> 17:17.360]  scary.
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.160]  And while we're not there yet, as shoppers we still face terrible traffic, crazy lines
[17:21.160 --> 17:24.640]  and even crazier shoppers, but this year can be different.
[17:24.640 --> 17:29.080]  You can still opt out of the craziness and do your shopping off the grid by going to

[18:00.560 --> 18:06.080]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[18:06.080 --> 18:08.800]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[18:08.800 --> 18:11.360]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.080]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care
[18:15.080 --> 18:16.760]  of your health and your own family.
[18:16.760 --> 18:19.760]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[18:19.760 --> 18:22.120]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[18:22.120 --> 18:26.320]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[18:26.320 --> 18:28.320]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[18:28.320 --> 18:31.680]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[18:31.680 --> 18:35.760]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[18:35.760 --> 18:38.960]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[18:38.960 --> 18:40.440]  I can't stress this enough.
[18:40.440 --> 18:43.080]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[18:43.080 --> 18:47.360]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[18:47.360 --> 18:54.680]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.

[20:05.560 --> 20:13.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:13.400 --> 20:20.720]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[20:20.720 --> 20:23.080]  the mind of man.
[20:23.080 --> 20:29.080]  I'm Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[20:29.080 --> 20:34.560]  Okay, I'm going to boil this down real simply and then read these articles and give you
[20:34.560 --> 20:41.680]  even more backstory to give you full spectrum analysis and breakdown of what we're facing.
[20:41.680 --> 20:48.400]  Criminal corporate financial oligarchs made major inroads by financing J.P. Morgan, the
[20:48.400 --> 20:54.200]  Rockefellers and others in the 1860s and forward.
[20:54.200 --> 20:58.320]  The robber barons then controlled the Western expansion.
[20:58.320 --> 21:03.600]  They set up monopolies and ever since then put out public reports that we've covered
[21:03.600 --> 21:10.080]  and posted and had historians on about breaking down the fact that they wanted to overthrow
[21:10.080 --> 21:14.720]  our Republican form of government, our constitutional republic.
[21:14.720 --> 21:16.280]  This is historical fact.
[21:16.280 --> 21:17.880]  They didn't even try to hide it.
[21:17.880 --> 21:21.360]  They financed eugenics, which meant survival of the fittest.
[21:21.360 --> 21:25.000]  They believed it was their right to rule, dominate, kill whoever they want.
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.720]  If they can do it, that gives them the right, might makes right.
[21:29.720 --> 21:31.400]  They already believed they were gods.
[21:31.400 --> 21:36.480]  They were financed by the Rothschilds and the British royalty and Dutch royalty.
[21:36.480 --> 21:39.600]  That's the main power centers of the Western system.
[21:39.600 --> 21:46.080]  The Vatican plays into that to a certain extent, especially more in modern times, but that
[21:46.080 --> 21:50.160]  main power structure and that system of governance came out of England.
[21:50.160 --> 21:54.040]  The concentration camp was invented on the Native Americans, picked up by the British
[21:54.040 --> 21:56.480]  after that.
[21:56.480 --> 22:05.400]  Now, they have gone for global financial domination by building giant bubbles of currency and
[22:05.400 --> 22:12.120]  derivatives garbage that is backed up by the U.S. military and U.S. taxpayers.
[22:12.120 --> 22:16.680]  They got the whole world to buy into it, and now they're saying, go along with what we
[22:16.680 --> 22:21.080]  say or we'll totally implode the world economy overnight.
[22:21.080 --> 22:25.920]  They've said it publicly in every country, the U.S. in 2008, right through Iceland, right
[22:25.920 --> 22:34.040]  through Greenland, right through Ireland, right through Greece, now into Spain, into
[22:34.040 --> 22:35.040]  Portugal.
[22:35.040 --> 22:36.840]  Portugal's rating private pension funds.
[22:36.840 --> 22:41.280]  They're now taking private pension funds, bringing them into government control and
[22:41.280 --> 22:45.720]  taking a large portion of it and calling it government protection of the funds.
[22:45.720 --> 22:50.960]  That's in their spiegel and Associated Press last night, and it's the same banks.
[22:50.960 --> 22:55.640]  When you hear about European banks, that's U.S. banks, that's globalist banks.
[22:55.640 --> 22:59.160]  That's the six big megabanks that we're dealing with.
[22:59.160 --> 23:02.280]  Now, they've committed this takeover.
[23:02.280 --> 23:06.960]  On the way up when the bubble was expanding, they bought up the planet, paid people off.
[23:06.960 --> 23:10.960]  Now they're holding the planet hostage saying, give us unlimited trillions, they call them
[23:10.960 --> 23:12.440]  bailouts.
[23:12.440 --> 23:16.160]  The media then turns it around and acts like the public owes this money, but they're really
[23:16.160 --> 23:17.280]  not even bailouts.
[23:17.280 --> 23:18.280]  It's lies within lies.
[23:18.280 --> 23:23.680]  It is direct global taxes to the six megabanks through their international consortiums of
[23:23.680 --> 23:28.040]  the IMF and World Bank and the U.S. arm, the Federal Reserve.
[23:28.040 --> 23:33.960]  The World Bank is more of the U.S. arm internationally of the Federal Reserve, but it's all interconnected.
[23:33.960 --> 23:38.840]  The IMF is mainly European and international as you go to the east.
[23:38.840 --> 23:41.360]  This is ultra-liberal commission, breakdown information.
[23:41.360 --> 23:42.360]  It's all public.
[23:42.360 --> 23:45.320]  The stuff, they think you're stupid, they think you don't care, they hide it in plain
[23:45.320 --> 23:46.640]  view for anybody that cares.
[23:46.640 --> 23:51.000]  Their architecture, their battle plans are all there because they think so little of
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.560]  you because they know you're designed to face a foreign enemy who wears a uniform and comes
[23:56.560 --> 24:02.440]  at you with a rifle and a bayonet, not someone that comes at you in business suits.
[24:02.440 --> 24:03.440]  Okay.
[24:03.440 --> 24:06.960]  So we're continuing with economic hitmen before I get into this huge FEMA camp news.
[24:06.960 --> 24:11.800]  You have to understand why it's happening.
[24:11.800 --> 24:16.040]  They are now admitting that the private banks have dominated Europe through fraud.
[24:16.040 --> 24:21.680]  Our media bought and paid for by them hails it as cutesy.
[24:21.680 --> 24:24.760]  They sit there and giggle about it on Bloomberg, TV and radio.
[24:24.760 --> 24:26.280]  They giggle about it on CNBC.
[24:26.280 --> 24:28.360]  Oh, how it's undemocratic.
[24:28.360 --> 24:32.320]  How Europe won't never be able to vote its way out of this now, getting rid of all of
[24:32.320 --> 24:37.420]  their sovereignty, how the Euro was only the receivership arm.
[24:37.420 --> 24:41.720]  Now they're going to implode that scaffolding and bring it fully under banker control with
[24:41.720 --> 24:47.960]  value added taxes, sales taxes, carbon taxes, family taxes, total social control, shutting
[24:47.960 --> 24:50.600]  off economies for social engineering.
[24:50.600 --> 24:54.640]  They want you dependent, period, global plantation.
[24:54.640 --> 25:03.760]  Now Patriots discovered this in the 1950s and 60s, namely Joseph McCarthy, who was demonized
[25:03.760 --> 25:07.800]  and who did have problems like anybody and who did.
[25:07.800 --> 25:12.640]  They allowed him to persecute innocent people because that created a new form of censorship
[25:12.640 --> 25:16.840]  in the name of countering communism, which actually brought us into authoritarianism
[25:16.840 --> 25:19.080]  in the name of fighting another authoritarianism.
[25:19.080 --> 25:22.280]  It was a Hegelian dialectic of problem and action solution.
[25:22.280 --> 25:24.680]  But the minute he discovered, I'm getting chills right now.
[25:24.680 --> 25:28.520]  This has even been in the New York Times and Moscow Times now, the minute he discovered
[25:28.520 --> 25:35.040]  that the Pentagon was funding the Russians and that the Pentagon and Armand Hammer and
[25:35.040 --> 25:41.720]  the Rothschilds and Rockefellers were running it all so that Russia had a pretext to clamp
[25:41.720 --> 25:42.720]  down.
[25:42.720 --> 25:46.840]  And so we had a pretext to be clamped down on, but that it was all a huge Hegelian dialectic
[25:46.840 --> 25:48.440]  of full spectrum dominance.
[25:48.440 --> 25:53.040]  The minute he said that, they destroyed him in the hearings, they said, you're saying
[25:53.040 --> 25:55.040]  the army's doing this.
[25:55.040 --> 26:00.920]  Now in hindsight, they've declassified the GRU and KGB files five years ago.
[26:00.920 --> 26:03.080]  International headlines, McCarthy was right.
[26:03.080 --> 26:04.960]  It was all true.
[26:04.960 --> 26:11.480]  But again, it's cutesy, it's all very cutesy.
[26:11.480 --> 26:17.680]  But because of people warning the population and understanding it, understanding that
[26:17.680 --> 26:22.920]  mega rich want socialism and communism and collectivism and communitarianism and agenda
[26:22.920 --> 26:29.240]  21 for the general public to make us dependent on them, they sit international and are exempt
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.920]  from that and are exempt from taxes as you see.
[26:32.920 --> 26:37.440]  Then they lobby for more taxes, telling the poor you'll get wealth redistribution with
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.480]  all this conspicuous consumption that they see and are licking their lips for.
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.360]  If you get rid of the middle class, who the poor believe is rich, they're actually the
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.640]  only group still employing the poor, still buying things from them.
[26:49.640 --> 26:52.720]  That service economy must be eradicated, and it is.
[26:52.720 --> 26:55.560]  This is a philosophy of total degradation.
[26:55.560 --> 26:58.600]  Now I will give you the top news.
[26:58.600 --> 27:05.400]  My point is, the globalists have been very arrogant and very out in the open in their
[27:05.400 --> 27:10.880]  white papers about vaccines that sterilize fluoride in the water to increase cancer,
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.280]  lower fertility, dumb everybody down.
[27:16.280 --> 27:21.600]  They have all been very honest about this because they have total contempt for you.
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.240]  Total contempt that you're not going to go read that because it's not the latest to
[27:26.240 --> 27:36.440]  sitcom or drama or a woman's show or men's soap opera that basically is football.
[27:36.440 --> 27:41.920]  They think that you deserve it, and so they just hide it in plain view.
[27:41.920 --> 27:46.840]  But because the globalists know that when they bring in this total collapse, people
[27:46.840 --> 27:49.920]  are going to get angry, there's going to be a move to restore the republic, there's
[27:49.920 --> 27:55.840]  going to be a move to unroot them that have engineered this publicly, that they have built
[27:55.840 --> 28:01.120]  FEMA camps, they have continuity of government programs, they have mass arrest programs, they've
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.080]  tried to train the military and police to go along with this.
[28:04.080 --> 28:09.680]  They federalize things, they've put in the surveillance grid, and they've got different
[28:09.680 --> 28:14.840]  ways they can roll it out, a stage bio attack, a stage chemical attack, other terror attacks,
[28:14.840 --> 28:17.120]  mass shootings, blamed on domestic groups.
[28:17.120 --> 28:23.840]  They've got a whole constellation of systems they can use to psi off people into going
[28:23.840 --> 28:29.560]  along with this because they've committed these crimes, they've committed this economic
[28:29.560 --> 28:38.000]  espionage, this economic invasion, this economic program of globalization, deindustrialization,
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.880]  and all of it so they can consolidate all power and leave no enemy standing.
[28:41.880 --> 28:46.080]  They see anybody with a business, anybody independent as the enemy.
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.840]  It's a scorched earth policy of kill the buffalo, let the red man starve.
[28:50.840 --> 29:01.040]  It's a scorched earth policy, research what that is.
[29:01.040 --> 29:05.240]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

[32:33.000 --> 32:35.400]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[33:33.760 --> 33:39.680]  Like all of you, I am devastated by the enormous impact on many people's lives resulting from
[33:39.680 --> 33:43.160]  the events surrounding the MF Global Bankruptcy.
[33:43.160 --> 33:49.320]  Of course, my distress and sadness pale in comparison to the losses and hardships that
[33:49.320 --> 33:55.800]  customers, farmers and ranchers and others, employees and investors have suffered.
[33:55.800 --> 33:58.520]  There plight weighs on my mind every day.
[33:58.520 --> 34:05.320]  As the Chief Executive Officer of MF Global at the time of its bankruptcy, I truly apologize
[34:05.320 --> 34:07.920]  to all those affected.
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.960]  Before I address what happened, I must make it clear that since my departure from MF Global
[34:11.960 --> 34:18.520]  on November 3rd this year, I have not had access to many of the relevant documents which
[34:18.520 --> 34:24.160]  are essential to my being able to testify accurately about the chaotic days preceding
[34:24.160 --> 34:26.920]  the declaration of bankruptcy.
[34:26.920 --> 34:33.400]  The members should also understand that committee turned down my request to testify voluntarily
[34:33.400 --> 34:34.400]  in January.
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.560]  I had hoped that by that time I would have obtained and reviewed relevant records so
[34:40.560 --> 34:43.520]  that I could be more helpful to the committee.
[34:43.520 --> 34:48.080]  While I intend to be responsive to the best of my ability today, without adequate time
[34:48.080 --> 34:54.800]  and materials, to prepare, I may be unable to respond to various questions members might
[34:54.800 --> 34:56.320]  pose.
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.160]  Other questions given my specific role in the company will be questions for which I
[35:00.160 --> 35:03.000]  simply have no personal knowledge.
[35:03.000 --> 35:09.200]  Make it very clear many of your questions may well be ones I myself have.
[35:09.200 --> 35:15.000]  When I joined the company in late March 2010, MF Global was primarily a voice-based broker
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.440]  that provided execution and clearing services for products traded in derivative markets.
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.040]  I'd like to comment on what he's already said.
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.840]  The firm had reported losses in five consecutive quarters before I arrived.
[35:27.840 --> 35:31.680]  What he's doing is he's already pleading the 5th.
[35:31.680 --> 35:32.680]  Isn't it wonderful?
[35:32.680 --> 35:35.240]  He was going to wait until January.
[35:35.240 --> 35:42.120]  Oh, yeah, as everything got further and further away from the news, then he could slime in.
[35:42.120 --> 35:49.200]  Yeah, cause line could slime in with in January after this thing blows over a little bit.
[35:49.200 --> 35:51.600]  And oh, how sorry he is.
[35:51.600 --> 35:54.160]  Yeah, his heart is bleeding.
[35:54.160 --> 35:56.800]  He's worked what, a half a billion dollars.
[35:56.800 --> 36:02.440]  Yes, how about coming up with the money to cover the losses that the rest of us took?
[36:02.440 --> 36:06.400]  Gerald Salente is our guest, we just came back live.
[36:06.400 --> 36:11.400]  And so Corzine basically has come in and taken the 5th as the Washington Post reported
[36:11.400 --> 36:13.120]  that he would take the 5th.
[36:13.120 --> 36:15.560]  And he told the Washington Post that his lawyers did.
[36:15.560 --> 36:16.560]  They don't know where the money is.
[36:16.560 --> 36:21.120]  So how convenient the money is taken out of the accounts in early November.
[36:21.120 --> 36:27.200]  He leaves and now he doesn't know anything because he left the company and he's the one
[36:27.200 --> 36:29.000]  that made the 40 to one bet.
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.240]  This is unbelievable, Gerald Salente is our guest breaking this down.
[36:33.240 --> 36:35.520]  I mean, so this is our worst fears.
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.240]  They're trying to set the precedent, Gerald.
[36:37.240 --> 36:40.920]  And of course, for those that just joined us, you lost over six figures from your own
[36:40.920 --> 36:50.480]  private account that the large Chicago Mafia Exchange, the CMT, the Chicago trading group
[36:50.480 --> 36:54.760]  had the Chicago Mercantile had come out and said, oh, we're always going to cover everything.
[36:54.760 --> 36:55.760]  It's all insured.
[36:55.760 --> 36:57.960]  Now you're being told it's not insured.
[36:57.960 --> 36:59.640]  It's your money.
[36:59.640 --> 37:02.440]  What type of precedent does this set?
[37:02.440 --> 37:03.760]  Where does this go from here?
[37:03.760 --> 37:05.200]  We haven't talked to you in a week and a half.
[37:05.200 --> 37:06.200]  What have you learned?
[37:06.200 --> 37:10.760]  Well, I learned what I learned before and that's what I'm telling everybody.
[37:10.760 --> 37:12.040]  Your money isn't safe.
[37:12.040 --> 37:16.840]  If all you jerks out there shooting a mouth off that don't know what you're talking about,
[37:16.840 --> 37:23.440]  they've never had a seller like this in the history of the commodity exchange in 150 years.
[37:23.440 --> 37:27.880]  And I wasn't speculating, I made a deal to pick up delivery.
[37:27.880 --> 37:34.160]  And all those jerks out there that say I should have known better, yeah, how about this one?
[37:34.160 --> 37:42.560]  All those jerks in New Jersey that voted in this Don Corzine as senator and governor,
[37:42.560 --> 37:44.480]  you should have known better too.
[37:44.480 --> 37:50.120]  And all you other jerks out there like the Obama administration that welcomes Corzine
[37:50.120 --> 37:55.840]  into the White House and has them throw $35,000 of plate dinners, yeah, they should have known
[37:55.840 --> 37:56.840]  better too.
[37:56.840 --> 38:01.400]  Yeah, everybody but me should have known, I should have known, nobody else should have
[38:01.400 --> 38:04.760]  known that Corzine was giving us the chef.
[38:04.760 --> 38:07.040]  So let's go back and play this over.
[38:07.040 --> 38:13.520]  So these committee hearings begin with a guy asking a question, a congressman, who said
[38:13.520 --> 38:19.240]  he didn't know until today that Gary Gensler, the head of the Commodities Future Trading
[38:19.240 --> 38:26.200]  Commission, was a lieutenant of Don Corzine when Corzine ran the Goldman Sachs gang back
[38:26.200 --> 38:27.200]  in the 90s.
[38:27.200 --> 38:32.840]  He didn't know that, the guy asking questions, then the question he asked was, well you had
[38:32.840 --> 38:39.840]  a meeting back with Gary Gensler and John Corzine several months ago.
[38:39.840 --> 38:41.880]  Do you have notes of that meeting?
[38:41.880 --> 38:45.880]  And here's what the woman who they're questioning, and you know why they're questioning this
[38:45.880 --> 38:49.800]  woman and not questioning Gary Gensler?
[38:49.800 --> 38:58.040]  Gary's gone, Gary had to go on an important trip, so that's like asking a soldier from
[38:58.040 --> 39:03.120]  the Don what the Don was thinking, so they don't even have Gensler there today.
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.760]  Here's what she said, no substantive issues were discussed.
[39:07.760 --> 39:11.800]  Hey, sweetie pie, what are you talking about?
[39:11.800 --> 39:14.640]  No substantive issues were discussed.
[39:14.640 --> 39:16.920]  What was this meeting about?
[39:16.920 --> 39:21.760]  What the Yankees were going to do in spring training, I mean come on, you don't get the
[39:21.760 --> 39:31.000]  two people together, the head of the Commodities Future Trading Commission and one of the top
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.120]  guys of the biggest trading firms in the world together to talk about nothing.
[39:36.120 --> 39:41.440]  Let's put this in layman terms though Gerald, why this is so big, to explain this, and then
[39:41.440 --> 39:46.840]  this was out a month ago, the head of the CFTC who is there to regulate this is the
[39:46.840 --> 39:57.200]  former lieutenant of Don John Corzine, the Obama money bag man who sets up MF Global,
[39:57.200 --> 40:01.640]  grabs a bunch of other companies, buys them and then steals private bank accounts which
[40:01.640 --> 40:05.080]  they admit is totally illegal and was supposedly insured.
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.000]  Now they say they don't know where the money is, they're talking to his lieutenants and
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.520]  they're saying, oh what was it this meeting, oh I don't know, nothing substantive, he gets
[40:13.520 --> 40:18.000]  there and says I know nothing, I left the company a month ago and all this imploded
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.760]  so I know nothing when he's the one who was heading it up and takes the fifth, I mean
[40:22.760 --> 40:28.240]  this is so incredibly ridiculous and it goes further.
[40:28.240 --> 40:34.480]  The head of the CFTC who's disappeared, maybe he's in paraglade, the head of the CFTC, maybe
[40:34.480 --> 40:38.440]  he's the boys with Brazil down there with the old Nazis, I don't know.
[40:38.440 --> 40:43.760]  It now turns out Reuters reports that he was invested in MF Global.
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.480]  So this is, Gerald, this is like you said 150 years of the mercantile, this has never
[40:49.480 --> 40:54.720]  been done, what's going on here, what's happening and they got the trolls attacking you of course,
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.400]  they're attacking us, they're saying it's good, the ATF now admits that they did ship
[40:59.400 --> 41:02.920]  guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment, they're like, the Second Amendment's who's
[41:02.920 --> 41:07.520]  bad because the government ship guns into Mexico to blame it on it, so that's always
[41:07.520 --> 41:08.520]  blamed the messenger.
[41:08.520 --> 41:09.520]  Gerald, this is huge.
[41:09.520 --> 41:14.040]  Yes it is, so you know what they were talking about at this meeting?
[41:14.040 --> 41:22.040]  They were talking about whether Don, John, the governor-causine could raid segregated
[41:22.040 --> 41:27.280]  accounts like mine, that's what they were talking about and they don't, they don't
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.200]  think they have any notes because well it was according to that woman, you know just
[41:32.200 --> 41:34.200]  a little idle chit chat.
[41:34.200 --> 41:40.600]  Now this whole thing is a scam, the whole system is collapsing, it's collapsing in front
[41:40.600 --> 41:47.720]  of us, so what I'm telling people, your money's not safe anywhere unless you got it in your
[41:47.720 --> 41:53.520]  pocket or under your mattress because they're going to rob it from us and here's what these
[41:53.520 --> 41:59.120]  clowns that in this commission that are asking these questions, you know what they're saying,
[41:59.120 --> 42:04.720]  things like well you know we've learned a valuable lesson from this, so how could we
[42:04.720 --> 42:11.040]  put better locks on the bond door so the horse doesn't escape and they're not even talking
[42:11.040 --> 42:15.400]  about hanging a horse thief, oh no that's off limits.
[42:15.400 --> 42:20.760]  No, no, here's Corzine who ran out with the money in front of everybody saying I know
[42:20.760 --> 42:25.600]  nothing and they don't even grill him, it is unbelievable.
[42:25.600 --> 42:31.680]  It's not unbelievable, it's what's happened, fascism has come to America, it's the merger
[42:31.680 --> 42:38.720]  of state and corporate powers and you have no greater power than the money power.
[42:38.720 --> 42:46.960]  During this time of Christmas let us all remember that the only time Jesus Christ the Prince
[42:46.960 --> 42:55.280]  of Peace became angry and violent is when he picked up a whip and drove the money changers
[42:55.280 --> 43:02.760]  out of the temple and that's a fact.
[43:02.760 --> 43:07.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, this is our last
[43:07.280 --> 43:09.640]  chance to not relive history.
[43:09.640 --> 43:14.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  at home.
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.640]  They've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[43:19.640 --> 43:20.640]  calling the shots.
[43:20.640 --> 43:25.920]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[43:25.920 --> 43:31.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[43:31.440 --> 43:36.120]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[43:36.120 --> 43:40.480]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[43:40.480 --> 43:42.640]  is saying who do we make the check out to?
[43:42.640 --> 43:48.680]  Today it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[43:48.680 --> 43:49.680]  the Republic.

[45:00.760 --> 45:06.280]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important
[45:06.280 --> 45:08.960]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[45:08.960 --> 45:11.560]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.360]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[45:15.360 --> 45:16.960]  your health and your own family.
[45:16.960 --> 45:19.960]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[45:19.960 --> 45:22.320]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[45:22.320 --> 45:26.760]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny Mae, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall
[45:26.760 --> 45:28.520]  owner, General Growth Properties.
[45:28.520 --> 45:31.920]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[45:31.920 --> 45:35.960]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.160]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[45:39.160 --> 45:40.640]  I can't stress this enough.
[45:40.640 --> 45:43.280]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[45:43.280 --> 45:47.520]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[45:47.520 --> 45:54.840]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.

[46:00.440 --> 46:03.320]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[46:03.320 --> 46:08.200]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognize
[46:08.200 --> 46:09.200]  risk.
[46:09.200 --> 46:10.280]  Saving means to make money.

[46:14.880 --> 46:20.040]  real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.

[46:25.760 --> 46:27.440]  or antibacterials.
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.960]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[46:32.960 --> 46:35.360]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[46:35.360 --> 46:38.640]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have

[47:12.040 --> 47:28.320]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[47:28.320 --> 47:54.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[47:54.400 --> 47:55.400]  Thank you.
[47:55.400 --> 47:58.680]  I was late getting back in the studio, running around out there, getting some more articles
[47:58.680 --> 47:59.680]  together.
[47:59.680 --> 48:04.480]  The next 25 minutes or so, we are joined by constitutional law expert Bruce Fine.
[48:04.480 --> 48:09.720]  Then I'm going to go back to your calls and into the Iran situation, threatening to block
[48:09.720 --> 48:16.120]  off the Strait of Hormuz, the admitted Western military attacks inside the country.
[48:16.120 --> 48:18.760]  We told you months ago that's what was happening.
[48:18.760 --> 48:19.760]  Now it's admitted.
[48:19.760 --> 48:22.200]  It was really going on years ago, but now it's accelerated.
[48:22.200 --> 48:27.120]  We'll also get into what's happening with the economy, but Bruce Fine joins us.
[48:27.120 --> 48:32.720]  He's a lawyer who specializes in constitutional international law, and of course, he's written
[48:32.720 --> 48:36.520]  articles for Slate, New York Times, Legal Times, The Washington Times.
[48:36.520 --> 48:38.440]  He's an expert on civil liberties.
[48:38.440 --> 48:41.960]  He's involved with the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation, both
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.200]  conservative think tanks as an analyst and commentator, and of course, he's also an author.
[48:47.200 --> 48:53.320]  He is Ron Paul's chief legal advisor on the Constitution Bill of Rights, an American Freedom
[48:53.320 --> 48:59.800]  Agenda.org is one of his sites, and he joins us now to talk about the State of the Union.
[48:59.800 --> 49:02.320]  Going back when he was on with this, I don't know, four or five months ago, we talked about
[49:02.320 --> 49:09.040]  Obama launching military operations and saying he didn't need Congress to do that, that he
[49:09.040 --> 49:11.880]  quote, did it for the credibility of the UN.
[49:11.880 --> 49:13.280]  I mean, what a slap in the face.
[49:13.280 --> 49:17.400]  What a treason that he became the head of the Security Council, violating Article 1,
[49:17.400 --> 49:19.120]  Section 9, flaunting it.
[49:19.120 --> 49:21.320]  The news even admitted that.
[49:21.320 --> 49:27.000]  Now we enter a new phase, and Obama says he'll veto the sections of the National Defense
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.840]  Authorization Act, where the military can arrest U.S. citizens, the whole world, a declaration
[49:31.840 --> 49:37.680]  of war against the world, kill anybody anywhere, including Northcom here in the U.S. So all
[49:37.680 --> 49:39.280]  of that's in there.
[49:39.280 --> 49:44.120]  Then Obama came out and said, I may not sign it because I'm the president, and I have that
[49:44.120 --> 49:49.760]  authority to kill citizens outside of law or courts or anything, anywhere in the world.
[49:49.760 --> 49:51.080]  So I don't need Congress.
[49:51.080 --> 49:56.360]  So the media tried to spend as old as Obama's for the Bill of Rights Constitution.
[49:56.360 --> 50:02.680]  No, the press releases lawyers put out last week, we covered it here, said something entirely
[50:02.680 --> 50:03.680]  different.
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.280]  We'll get Bruce Feins' breakdown on this and get his take on the Ron Paul campaign.
[50:07.280 --> 50:08.760]  Bruce, thanks for coming on with us today.
[50:08.760 --> 50:10.760]  Well, thank you for inviting me.
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.360]  While things are really accelerating, were you shocked by this legislation and give us
[50:14.360 --> 50:17.560]  your expert take on it and where this takes us?
[50:17.560 --> 50:23.280]  Yes, and I want to take it from how we interpret the president's threat to veto.
[50:23.280 --> 50:28.480]  This is before the legislation was passed by the Congress.
[50:28.480 --> 50:34.920]  The president claimed, as you indicated, authority unilaterally to fascinate any American anywhere
[50:34.920 --> 50:40.760]  in the world on his face, so alone, based upon secret facts, secret laws saying so-and-so
[50:40.760 --> 50:43.600]  is an imminent danger to the security of the United States.
[50:43.600 --> 50:46.880]  You don't have to be on a battlefield, you don't have to be involved in hostilities,
[50:46.880 --> 50:51.400]  you don't even have to be accused of a crime because Mr. Alwaki had never been indicted,
[50:51.400 --> 50:55.640]  he'd never been subject to any formal arrest warrant, anything like that, and neither was
[50:55.640 --> 50:58.720]  this 16-year-old kid who was vaporized a few days later.
[50:58.720 --> 51:04.080]  I mean, this is a power that would have made King George III jealous, and we overfrew
[51:04.080 --> 51:05.080]  King George III.
[51:05.080 --> 51:08.840]  This is a power that every tyrant would crave and celebrate.
[51:08.840 --> 51:14.560]  I can kill any of my citizens any time I want, based on secret facts and secret laws, and
[51:14.560 --> 51:15.560]  on imminent danger.
[51:15.560 --> 51:18.440]  I mean, he'd been on the list, Alwaki, for over a year.
[51:18.440 --> 51:21.720]  And imminent danger, I mean, imminent means it's going to happen immediately.
[51:21.720 --> 51:25.600]  It shows the Orwellian use of language by the Obama administration.
[51:25.600 --> 51:31.000]  But that's before he also claimed the absolute authority to decide on his own, whether if
[51:31.000 --> 51:36.920]  he did capture an American citizen or a non-citizen in the United States, based upon some suspicion
[51:36.920 --> 51:42.680]  that he said there's chose involvement in international terrorism, he could decide on
[51:42.680 --> 51:43.680]  his whim.
[51:43.680 --> 51:48.480]  I'll try you in a civilian court and prosecute you, or I'll try you in a military court,
[51:48.480 --> 51:50.360]  military commissions and prosecute you.
[51:50.360 --> 51:54.560]  I can just flip one way or the other, and you can't constrain me.
[51:54.560 --> 51:55.560]  What he...
[51:55.560 --> 51:56.560]  That was before the legislation.
[51:56.560 --> 52:02.080]  So what he objected to in the legislation wasn't the idea that any...
[52:02.080 --> 52:04.600]  No president should have this omnipotent authority.
[52:04.600 --> 52:10.280]  He was furious that Congress thought it had any faith to try to constrain him in any way,
[52:10.280 --> 52:14.760]  because Congress was trying to limit his ability to flip detainees from the military systems
[52:14.760 --> 52:15.760]  as billiards.
[52:15.760 --> 52:17.920]  So he wasn't defending civil liberties.
[52:17.920 --> 52:23.560]  He was destroying the last vestige of checks and balances and separation of powers by saying,
[52:23.560 --> 52:28.160]  Congress, you have no authority to try to limit me in any way I want whenever I claim
[52:28.160 --> 52:29.480]  I'm fighting a war.
[52:29.480 --> 52:34.920]  I am, I am the law, you know, it's like Louis XIV, the state, some what, it's me.
[52:34.920 --> 52:40.200]  And so the president, instead of understanding that, thinks now he's become an ACLU civil
[52:40.200 --> 52:43.560]  libertarian, by me telling the legislature.
[52:43.560 --> 52:44.560]  Incredible.
[52:44.560 --> 52:46.680]  That's what's so amazing.
[52:46.680 --> 52:51.400]  He's saying no, because you're trying to follow the Constitution, even though this is unconstitutional,
[52:51.400 --> 52:56.720]  the way you're trying to pass it's constitutional, I'm not going, and his lawyers said that,
[52:56.720 --> 53:01.040]  and the media went along with this, Bruce, do you think it's because they are ignorant
[53:01.040 --> 53:03.360]  or because they want to protect him?
[53:03.360 --> 53:06.960]  Well, I think it's a combination.
[53:06.960 --> 53:12.160]  Several of them think, I think truly are just totally ignorant.
[53:12.160 --> 53:21.320]  But others, clearly they want to, they do not like Congress, and this is a way in which
[53:21.320 --> 53:28.800]  they can try to paint Congress, do nothing, Congress, whatever, that in part here is not
[53:28.800 --> 53:30.320]  do nothing, Congress.
[53:30.320 --> 53:34.960]  They do not like the Tea Party conservative slant in the Congress, although this is the
[53:34.960 --> 53:36.680]  opposite of that.
[53:36.680 --> 53:41.760]  And so this is just another chance to slam the Congress of the United States, that certainly
[53:41.760 --> 53:47.200]  when they see something that isn't, that slight Obama.
[53:47.200 --> 53:50.240]  But a lot of it is just lavishness to the president.
[53:50.240 --> 53:53.960]  And I think also, it's unfortunate that it's not limited to Obama.
[53:53.960 --> 53:59.680]  I think the president in general has become cheerleaders for kings and queens, for omnipotence
[53:59.680 --> 54:04.600]  in the executive branch, and assailing any suggestion that self-government really ought
[54:04.600 --> 54:08.280]  to have any sway, because after all, these platonic guardians in the White House and
[54:08.280 --> 54:12.440]  the Oval Office should tell us how to live, whether we should have expenditures, broccoli
[54:12.440 --> 54:17.440]  and rules and regulations that Congress never touches, yet have enormous consequences for
[54:17.440 --> 54:18.440]  the economy.
[54:18.440 --> 54:25.600]  And it is a very, very arrogant, condescending attitude of government, the precise attitude
[54:25.600 --> 54:28.600]  that provoked the American Revolution in 1776.
[54:28.600 --> 54:33.680]  I mean, the founding fathers, if they saw this piece of legislation as president during
[54:33.680 --> 54:38.320]  that talk, they would have impeached the president in less than 24 hours.
[54:38.320 --> 54:43.760]  Bruce, obviously the system knows that the derivatives, the too big to fails, the crony
[54:43.760 --> 54:50.520]  capitalism is coming down, and we're seeing an acceleration of agendas that you and I
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.000]  and Ron Paul and many others had warned about and then laughed at now.
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  People aren't laughing.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.240]  I mean, does it have to get really bad before it gets better?
[54:58.240 --> 54:59.480]  Where do you expect this to go?
[54:59.480 --> 55:03.400]  I mean, do you expect them to be able to implement stuff like this?
[55:03.400 --> 55:09.400]  I mean, this does tell us a lot about the makeup of our government that they're attempting
[55:09.400 --> 55:10.400]  things like this.
[55:10.400 --> 55:16.880]  Well, it does, and it also is the most dangerous element here is what's become, maybe, a subtext
[55:16.880 --> 55:20.000]  of our national discourse, a risk-free society.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.440]  We can, anything that anybody says will make us safer is okay.
[55:23.440 --> 55:29.200]  The rack and screw for results in a vandalizing due process, detaining people without accusation
[55:29.200 --> 55:33.000]  or charge, anything you just yell, it makes us possibly safer even though it doesn't.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.080]  You know, they get away with it, and that's just the opposite of what the Constitution
[55:37.080 --> 55:38.080]  is about.
[55:38.080 --> 55:42.600]  The default position that the founding fathers want, that that was revolutionary at the time,
[55:42.600 --> 55:44.600]  was that individual liberty is the default.
[55:44.600 --> 55:49.000]  The government can't do anything unless it gives a really strong reason about why they
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.800]  should interfere with your physical and mental liberty and freedom.
[55:52.800 --> 55:56.600]  It doesn't mean an insurmountable hurdle, but that's the default position is liberty.
[55:56.600 --> 56:01.080]  Now, no, just make the government bigger, bigger, bigger, TSA, more screening, whatever
[56:01.080 --> 56:03.720]  anything goes that will arguably make us safer.
[56:03.720 --> 56:06.080]  You know, you've got to have some risk in life.
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.080]  You take risk when you get out of bed, you know, if somebody could come up and drive
[56:10.080 --> 56:11.560]  a car when you're on the sidewalk.
[56:11.560 --> 56:16.800]  Well, Bruce, as you know, as you know, historically, and I'd like you to speak to this briefly,
[56:16.800 --> 56:22.200]  we, tyrants always say it's for your own good, and historically, the greatest danger
[56:22.200 --> 56:27.520]  outside of natural death, the most unnatural death that we've seen, has been death by government
[56:27.520 --> 56:30.840]  or enslavement or impoverishment by government.
[56:30.840 --> 56:35.720]  I mean, this is the most dangerous thing, as George Washington said, like fire.
[56:35.720 --> 56:39.000]  This is a dangerous, servant, and a fearful master.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  Exactly right.
[56:41.000 --> 56:46.520]  And that's why it's not to say that individuals can't perpetrate evil, they can, they can't.
[56:46.520 --> 56:53.320]  But in magnitudes of danger, the government is capable of vastly more, a wretchedness,
[56:53.320 --> 56:58.720]  destruction of liberty, death than any private individual or group of individuals.
[56:58.720 --> 57:02.400]  And that's why the government is the one, the greatest group, and has to be put upon.
[57:02.400 --> 57:06.840]  And it was James Madison, just think about this, this is over 200 years ago.
[57:06.840 --> 57:12.800]  He pointed out, and he, he warned, he said, the instruments of, of, of repression that
[57:12.800 --> 57:18.240]  are used initially to fight a foreign danger are invariably used by tyrants to destroy liberty
[57:18.240 --> 57:19.240]  at home.
[57:19.240 --> 57:23.440]  This is the greatest pressure, you know, that had ever been uttered by an American statement.
[57:23.440 --> 57:25.320]  He knew exactly what's going to happen.
[57:25.320 --> 57:29.600]  So first, okay, we're just going to use these special procedures in Afghanistan, and then
[57:29.600 --> 57:31.600]  Iraq, then Yemen, then Somalia.
[57:31.600 --> 57:34.280]  And now they're on the American, our American soil.
[57:34.280 --> 57:40.880]  And what I fear, Alex, is that if there's anything like another 9-11, or even somebody
[57:40.880 --> 57:44.600]  who stands up and says, all right, Iran's got nuclear weapons, a president's going
[57:44.600 --> 57:51.280]  to declare martial law.
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.320]  Attention GCN listeners, do you have a patriot on your Christmas list that's nearly impossible

[58:52.040 --> 58:56.280]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with
[58:56.280 --> 59:00.880]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[59:00.880 --> 59:04.720]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[59:04.720 --> 59:07.400]  anywhere in or on the body.
[59:07.400 --> 59:12.160]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[59:12.160 --> 59:16.760]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[59:16.760 --> 59:21.440]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[59:21.440 --> 59:24.960]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[59:24.960 --> 59:32.880]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.

[59:55.760 --> 1:00:01.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:05.880]  And I'm fearful right now we have an American culture that so he feed in its defense of
[1:00:05.880 --> 1:00:10.680]  individual liberty and so willing to accept battle is to some big brother government
[1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:11.680]  who yells safety.
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:13.680]  But then the president would get away with it.
[1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:14.680]  Well Bruce, that and Bruce.
[1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:17.480]  As you know, that's the end of the entire architecture.
[1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:20.960]  I'm going to skip this network break here so stations shouldn't cover this up.
[1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:21.960]  It's a network break.
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:22.960]  I'm going to skip it.
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:25.520]  We've only got you at the bottom of the hour and this is so important constitutional
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:31.080]  law expert, congressional expert, Ron Paul's main advisor on legal issues.
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:33.560]  Constitutional lawyer, Bruce Finney is also an author.
[1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:40.400]  Bruce, let's shift gears in the same area, but shifting gears, look at Newt Gennrich.
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:45.120]  Newt Gennrich has been attacking Ron Paul calling him a joke, Donald Trump's been calling
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:52.280]  him a joke when Donald Trump is a joke by any yardstick, Mr. Eminent Domain, Mr. Democratic
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:56.200]  Party contributor who claims he's a Republican, clearly a ringer.
[1:00:56.200 --> 1:01:02.360]  But Newt Gennrich has now been endorsed by the former Federal Reserve head of Kansas
[1:01:02.360 --> 1:01:04.160]  City, Herman Cain.
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:08.760]  And Newt Gennrich, who is for indefinite detention, torture all of this, who's for
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:13.040]  carbon taxes, who's for all these different globalist things.
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:18.240]  He is now the frontrunner, Ron Paul's admitted number two now in Iowa and other states.
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:23.200]  What's your view on Newt Gennrich and what's wrong with mainline Republicans or do you
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.040]  think these polls are a fraud?
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:30.280]  How could any conservative with half a brain like Newt Gennrich?
[1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:31.280]  I don't know.
[1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:38.080]  This guy is the epitome of inside the beltway cynicism, is the one thing one day, the other
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:44.520]  the next day, he exploits all the political chicanery known to mankind, a historian for
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:51.360]  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, $40, $50 million that he gets out of for lobbying Congress
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:57.560]  on his health care issue, he's an egomaniac, he cheats on his wife, he claims that he's
[1:01:57.560 --> 1:02:03.080]  great for frugality and he has a Tiffany's bank account of $500,000, he manipulates and
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:08.560]  utilizes non-profit organizations to benefit his political campaign, his profit making
[1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:10.560]  organizations for free.
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:16.720]  Any spouse, anything under the sun, no matter how glib, yet absurd they are, his statement,
[1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:21.880]  for example, the president should flout decisions of the US Supreme Court if they think they're
[1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:22.880]  wrong.
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:23.880]  Wow, that's really something.
[1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:29.120]  This is somebody who was talking about Ron Paul as being a joke, this guy was destroyed.
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:34.440]  The greatest conception of all constitutions in the history of the world, judicial review
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:40.000]  in 1787, and not the whim of New Congress, no, the president just sat back with the Supreme
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:44.320]  Court and you see how absurd that is because he's at the same time saying, oh, if the Supreme
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:49.000]  Court declares the health care bill unconstitutional, then it should fall, but at the same time
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.720]  he's basically saying, well, Obama could just ignore it and implement the health care
[1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:53.720]  anyway.
[1:02:53.720 --> 1:02:58.600]  I mean, the guy is a total intellectual jumble of contradictions and sentences and I believe
[1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:03.960]  that the only reason that explains his rise is that he's not Mitt Rom, and Mitt is so
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:09.080]  statuette, he's so off-putting as a candidate, they're sort of scrambling the Republican
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:14.360]  star for somebody else and Newt is the candidate for that particular time, but I believe as
[1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:23.360]  more of these words in Newt become more known and prominent, he will fall like a shooting
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:30.920]  star and a comet out of the sky and be destroyed because his character is so flawed that he
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:35.240]  simply cannot withstand a sustained public scrutiny.
[1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:38.480]  Amazing analysis, absolutely on target.
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:41.440]  Looking at Newt Gennrich, it's like shark teeth.
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:46.960]  All these different politicians come forward, the public learns about them, they fall away,
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:55.280]  you've seen it with Perry, with Romney, with Newt, with Bachman, with all of them, only
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:58.960]  Ron Paul has stayed number one, number two, or number three in every straw poll, every
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:03.680]  scientific poll, he now is, and I'm not just saying this because I'm a Ron Paul supporter,
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:09.040]  I'm always a realist, he really is the front runner in all the big polls, he beats Obama
[1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:10.040]  handily.
[1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:14.640]  I mean, he is the man, he should be our next president, he's been dead on about why we're
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:19.480]  in so much trouble, he's the only candidate that will actually address it, and if we don't
[1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:24.480]  elect Ron Paul, if the power structure doesn't elect Ron Paul, I mean, as corrupt as the
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:28.600]  power structure is, they can't just keep robbing and stealing, they're going to kill
[1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:30.120]  the Golden Goose.
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:31.120]  Your take on that.
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:36.040]  Yeah, I think that's right, but the history of empire is the history of self-ruination,
[1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:40.760]  but I certainly agree with your assessment of Ron Paul, and this is what I can say with
[1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:48.040]  100% firsthand, he is the only candidate who's not running for self-aggrandite, he's the
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:52.600]  only candidate who's not driven by egomain, he's the only candidate that we know, when
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:58.360]  he's in the Oval Office and he makes the decision, he will be based upon what he thinks are
[1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:00.640]  best for the nation and those yet to be born.

[1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:13.200]  The leading expert and champion of exposing this 21st century authoritarianism that looked
[1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:18.840]  invincible just 5 years ago, but is now flailing in its apparent death rows, but is still clinging
[1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:24.080]  to life and still is dangerous as ever, unfortunately, and with him in Durban, South Africa, where
[1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:28.440]  they're having this conference, his Mark Moreno of Climate Depot, the leading group
[1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:32.240]  here in the United States, and of course he's been an advisor to the Congress as well, Lord
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:36.840]  Moncton, of course was one of the chief advisors to Margaret Thatcher, he's a journalist and
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:41.880]  researcher as well as an inventor, and again he joins us from this International Climate
[1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.560]  Court of Justice, now they have courts and we must pay a price to the earth, which means
[1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:51.880]  paying money to Al Gore and others, Lord Moncton, thank you for joining us.
[1:06:51.880 --> 1:07:00.240]  It's a real pleasure, Alex, in fact the authoritarianism of the UN knows no bounds, on entirely arbitrary
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:06.880]  grounds they tried to ban me from the conference once I arrived here, so I went away and we
[1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:12.480]  got a plane and I dropped in my parachute instead, and they weren't used to dealing
[1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:17.320]  with that, and it's had massive publicity around the world, and the UN is now looking
[1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:22.160]  very silly indeed for having tried to ban me on an entirely trumped up nonsense which
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:24.960]  they've now had to back off from.
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:29.840]  Well that's amazing, and this isn't the first time they've tried this, is it?
[1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:35.000]  No, they're always doing this, the fact is that we are now the Committee for a Constructive
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  Tomorrow, which is the environmental charity that I come here with, which has real projects
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:48.640]  to help the poor people of Africa and of Latin America, it's not just a pressure group.
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:54.960]  They are the only organisation here which disagrees with what I'm going to call the
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:59.600]  Marxist Party Line, what they would call the Scientific Consensus, let's call it what
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:06.600]  it is, the Marxist Party Line, on this whole climate nonsense, and so they always do,
[1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:11.840]  I mean four or five years ago in Bali, where I had booked a room for press conferences
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:14.840]  through the UN Secretariat.
[1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:19.600]  We were in a press conference one day, very well attended, when along came the Chief of
[1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:24.400]  the Secretariat and said, you can't have press conferences in this room, and I said, we booked
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:28.280]  these in good faith, and they said, we don't care, yours is the wrong message, and we'll
[1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:32.600]  have you arrested if you go on giving out the wrong message, that's the kind of thing
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:38.520]  that the UN does to us every time, and you may remember in Copenhagen last year, I was
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:42.840]  knocked out by a policeman, not sure whether he was a Danish policeman or a UN policeman,
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:48.000]  but either way, I was hit from behind while walking away from the policeman in question,
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:54.240]  there's no doubt they do not like hearing home truths about how their little scientific
[1:08:54.240 --> 1:09:00.240]  scam and fraud is collapsing, and how even if they were right on the science, the near
[1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:05.720]  unanimous view in the peer review literature is that economically speaking, it's better
[1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:10.640]  to sit back and enjoy the sunshine and do nothing, but the real breaking news here at
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:17.600]  this conference, that is, is the extraordinary story that in the 138 page document to which
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:24.000]  the US bureaucrats fondly think the various member states, all 194 of them, of the Framework
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:28.960]  Convention on Climate Change are going to agree, there are now provisions for protecting
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:34.400]  the rights, not of people, not of animals, not of plants, but of Mother Earth, we're
[1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:40.640]  now in straightforward old fashioned superstition territory now, the rights of Mother Earth,
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:47.120]  and they're going to be enforced against the West only by a new international climate
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:53.040]  court run by the UN with absolute power to order Western countries such as the United
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:58.200]  States to hand over money and to run their economies and their environments in whatever
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:02.000]  way the so-called causes can be recorded by.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:05.560]  Sir, I want to go through this as you join us from South Africa, but what, just two or
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:10.680]  three months ago, the UN said we want green helmets that will invade your country, so
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:16.200]  now the UN and NATO will put some rebels in and then claim that they're a democratic group
[1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:21.280]  and NATO bombards and calls it peace, and the peace president gets behind it, Obama,
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:24.400]  and they're talking about another peace prize because how great these so-called peace wars
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:29.620]  are, and so I've also seen cases where these UN carbon credits, as you know, in South
[1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:33.640]  America, Central America, and Africa, Main Street, even New York Times admits that they
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:39.200]  come in and kill the locals to take their property, to then plant trees on it to save
[1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:40.200]  the Earth.
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:46.120]  I mean, isn't this just a new excuse for select globalist corporate colonialism to invade
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:51.120]  and take over land, but also then shut down real free market companies as we see power
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:55.800]  plants being shut down now all over the U.S., and they're now admitting, okay, your prices
[1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:57.440]  are going up?
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:10:59.440]  That's right.
[1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:05.240]  Let's try and deal with the business of invading people's villages and moving out or killing
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:06.240]  the villagers.
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:13.720]  This has happened not that far from here in Uganda, where large areas of land were cleared
[1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:18.640]  so that the government of Uganda could claim quite falsely that the land was being used
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:21.200]  as what is called a carbon sink.
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:26.640]  And all of this is the kind of nonsensical, topsy-turvy false accounting that leads to
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:33.280]  these ghastly actions where goons from governments and from the UN go in and shoot people who
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:37.280]  are on land that they want to take over and turn into a so-called carbon sink.
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:42.240]  This is becoming rather frightening, Alex, as you know, I often have to calm you down
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:45.160]  and say, no, no, no, it's not as bad as all that.
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:52.480]  That is that this UN conference has gone far, far further than any other in what is essentially
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:58.320]  a sustained malevolent attack on the free West.
[1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:03.880]  The entire agreement is framed so that there's no question of democratic election of this
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:08.120]  world government, but they're so rapidly establishing the thousand new bureaucracies
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:12.800]  that were created at Cancun and are now all beavering away to undermine the West like
[1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:16.160]  Tomeit ants. All of this is going on.
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:21.240]  And the most extreme document I've ever read is this latest one with its criminal court,
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:26.960]  with its rights of Mother Earth, with the right of our small island states to survive
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:31.960]  the rising sea level, which incidentally, Alex, has been rising at a dizzying rate equivalent
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:38.120]  to two inches per century over each of the last eight years, according to the latest
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:39.120]  satellite.
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.680]  So that's not going to give them much problem, is it?
[1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:50.600]  So all of this fiction and all of this fraud is now being encapsulated in one giant document,
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:56.440]  which now says they in effect want to make the world colder by two Celsius degrees,
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:01.560]  which is three Fahrenheit degrees. It's quite a big drop. You're getting kind of on for
[1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:06.920]  a third of the way back to the last ice age, if you do that. That would kill hundreds of
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:10.840]  millions, but that's what the lunatics, and that's the only word I can think of to describe
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:16.240]  the lunatics here, are arguing for. They're arguing that carbon dioxide concentration
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:21.000]  should now be cut back to, effectively, not much more than 200 parts per million. And
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:25.800]  that is the point at which plants and trees die because they don't have enough carbon
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:26.800]  dioxide.
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:28.800]  Let me stop you there. Let me stop you there because...
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:31.800]  It's quite extraordinary. I mean, this is incredible.
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:36.880]  By the way, a moment, and I want you to really bore down to this because it's important.
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.440]  You're there. You've gotten the document. You're breaking it down. You were instrumental
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:46.080]  at the Copenhagen event, helping get the document where they called for world government and
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:50.880]  almost doubling the cuts on carbon emissions, the third world that has admitted what billion
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:57.320]  dead people over a decade, death sentence. This is really almost a military attack on
[1:13:57.320 --> 1:14:02.920]  infrastructure, on energy that a foreign enemy, that Stalin or Hitler, could never have dreamed
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:07.520]  of achieving. And when you look at the carbon cycle, sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and
[1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:12.840]  oxygen, they've picked carbon dioxide because folks know sunlight's good, water's good,
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:19.080]  and that oxygen's good. So they literally are teaching kids that carbon dioxide's evil.
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:22.640]  They have all these video games where they fight carbon dioxide monsters. But I want
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:26.000]  you to go back to what you just said and go over this document. This is breaking news
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:32.240]  at your science and public policy website and at InfoWars as well. And you guys are
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:39.040]  there in South Africa covering this, where they're openly saying they've said geoengineered
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:42.760]  things of need be because I know the world's already in a very low carbon dioxide rate
[1:14:42.760 --> 1:14:48.240]  from what it's been in past millennia and actually cut it. I mean, these people, it's
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:52.920]  like a science fiction movie, like they're demons from hell or something.
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:58.920]  What they are, Alex, is certifiably insane. There's really no other way of describing
[1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:05.440]  it. To want to make the planet two degrees cooler, which is effectively what their target
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:11.320]  now means. To want to take the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere down to the point
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:18.080]  where trees and plants will die. To do these things and to say that Western emissions of
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:27.240]  carbon dioxide must begin to decline immediately, and we must cut by, get this, more than 100
[1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:33.760]  percent by 2050. So there'll be no coal-fired power stations, no automobiles, no oil-fired
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:39.000]  power stations, no gas-fired power stations, no industry, no hospitals. We will be straight
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:43.280]  back to the Stone Age, Alex, if they get away with this nonsense, and without even
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:50.080]  the right to light a carbon emitting fire in our caves. And if we misbehave, the International
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:57.080]  Climate Court will be there to order the troops in to make sure that we shut down our industry.
[1:15:57.080 --> 1:16:08.680]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:13.000]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:22.560]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They're so
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:31.920]  bright in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:40.360]  in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:47.160]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:51.720]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you could
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:58.720]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it,
[1:16:58.720 --> 1:16:59.720]  others don't.
[1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:05.160]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[1:17:05.160 --> 1:17:10.040]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:12.720]  It really says that the state is God.
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:17.240]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:22.920]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:28.280]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:30.960]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:35.240]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:39.520]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:45.520]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:49.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:52.080]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:16.520]  Now here is the really odd thing about this, Alex. I'm not making this stuff up. You may
[1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:21.840]  think this is so extreme that Munchen must have finally flipped his top and gone completely
[1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:27.720]  mad or banged his head on landing off his parachute. But no, I haven't. All of this
[1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:33.640]  is actually in the document that I got from the UN's Documentation Center and it was
[1:20:33.640 --> 1:20:39.680]  available, provided you knew to ask for it, to any journalist who wanted a copy of it.
[1:20:39.680 --> 1:20:45.960]  Not one of them anywhere in the world, as far as I know, has reported the details that
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:55.560]  you'll find at scienceandpublicpolicy.org, at climatedepot.org, on your website, infowars.com.
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:21:02.560]  We are the few people that are telling the world what is in this document. Now, there's
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:06.800]  no incentive to me to make this stuff up, because if I did, people would look at the
[1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:11.920]  document and say, no, it's just all fiction. He's just making it up. All of this is actually
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:18.440]  there. It is plainly of interest to the peoples of the West, so that readers of the Times
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:24.640]  of London, the Times of New York, et cetera, would surely be intrigued to know this stuff
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:31.360]  and yet, and here's the really sinister thing, not a word of any of this is appearing in
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:35.040]  print. Why do you think that is, Alex, because I can't work it out?
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:40.360]  Well, this is what's happened. You got the secret Copenhagen text, and torpedoed it.
[1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:44.640]  You helped publicize the emails that got leaked, and we've had several climate gates since
[1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:48.800]  then. I think it's fleeing forward. Instead of trying to get the incremental power grab,
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:53.240]  they see, and they've got national and international pulses, you know, coming out, that it's flipped
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:59.480]  completely. In some cases, higher than 80% know it's pure bull. They've now discovered
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:03.880]  that China makes no cuts, India, Mexico, 100 plus other third world countries. We all make
[1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:08.880]  cuts in the West. They know it's a deaf, sinister industry, and they know insiders like General
[1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:12.680]  Electric that are on the President's Council, the same in your country, are exempt. So they
[1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:17.880]  know what it is, a mafia power grab. These people aren't even well-meaning socialists
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:21.200]  at the end of the day. These are cold-blooded mafia people, so I think you've answered
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:28.080]  your own question. They're operating by stealth now, and going for it all. I mean, is that
[1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:32.400]  what you're seeing, or is that what your gut is? I mean, what's the sense of them this
[1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:37.800]  time as they lash out and try to ban you from the conference? I mean, are they showing even
[1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:40.320]  more fear of you and Mark Moreno than they normally do?
[1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:46.560]  They are absolutely terrified. I went to see Negumi Endo, who is the UN official that sent
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:52.240]  me an email arbitrarily saying you've been banned. She didn't even say why I'd been banned.
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:56.160]  She just said, we hope you will accept that this ban was appropriate without telling us
[1:22:56.160 --> 1:23:02.000]  why it was we've been banned. It turned out that I've been banned because she said I had
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  been operating a video camera, which I hadn't been operating, and that I had been failing
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:13.680]  to obey instructions of UN officials when no UN official had given any instruction either
[1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:19.000]  to me or in my hearing. Likewise, they said I was harassing people when, in fact, in the
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:23.080]  end, when I said this is an outrage and I will have to go to court unless you at least
[1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:27.800]  withdraw that one, they backed off and said, okay, the allegation of harassment didn't
[1:23:27.800 --> 1:23:34.040]  have substance and wasn't pursued. The fact was the entire thing was simply made up because
[1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:38.680]  they knew that if I got into that conference, which of course, eventually I did by threatening
[1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:44.840]  to go to the court of Quazulu Natale, the High Court, and get an order telling the UN
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:49.440]  to behave because they hadn't complied even with the most elementary principles of natural
[1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:54.400]  justice. They backed off pretty quick when I threatened to do that. So I got in, got
[1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:59.160]  this document, and wrote it up and got it out. And they were trying very, very hard
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:03.800]  to stop me because they knew that if anybody was going to expose this scam for exactly
[1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:09.320]  what it is, it was probably going to be somebody like me. But yet again, they have failed.
[1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:14.440]  And I can tell you this, Alex, it's rather like a funeral parlor in the conference this
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:23.560]  year. At Copenhagen, there were 30,000 people at the Cancun conference, probably 20 to 25,000.
[1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:29.000]  Now I think there were about 10,000 there, the UN is claiming 15,000 were registered,
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.640]  but in fact, quite a lot of them didn't even bother to turn up. This whole process is collapsing
[1:24:33.640 --> 1:24:40.520]  as it collapses. What we're seeing with these extremist documents is the UN desperately
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:47.400]  trying to keep the process going by adding new and absurd commitments such as to go back
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:53.240]  halfway towards the last ice age and to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations to the point
[1:24:53.240 --> 1:25:00.360]  where freezing plants begin to die. These extreme measures are simply they are the death
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:08.280]  rows of this process. That's really what it is. They've become so entirely detached
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:15.400]  from any form of rationality or reality that they no longer understand how malevolent,
[1:25:15.400 --> 1:25:21.880]  how unpleasant, how anti-democratic, how anti-Western, and how downright unfair to the people
[1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:27.080]  and other creatures of this planet, all of these measures that they propose would be.
[1:25:27.080 --> 1:25:33.400]  They have lost the plot and I think the only thing we can do now is to say that the UN
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:41.000]  and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change must be closed down immediately and all of the
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  bureaucrats, over thousands and tens of thousands of bureaucrats, hundreds of thousands and
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:51.240]  probably millions by now, living off the world's taxpayers must all be kicked out and told to
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:59.880]  go and get a proper job. Absolutely. In closing though, how do you expect them now to regroup
[1:25:59.880 --> 1:26:04.120]  and counter-strike? You predicted them with all these new fear-mongering announcements.
[1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:09.080]  Now they've had all these other climate gates, countless ones, frauds, confirmation of the
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:13.880]  previous frauds. I mean their credibility is shot but as you've said tens of billions has
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:19.880]  been invested by the insider robber barons to try to consolidate power through their communist
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:27.400]  handmaidens and so they're not going to go away. How do you expect them to reinvent themselves?
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:32.280]  I think what they will do is they will first of all, as usual, declare a success. They're going
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:37.320]  to negotiate all through the night. It's the usual tired public relations game plan. They will emerge
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:40.840]  tomorrow morning with their ties around their ears, stubble on their cheeks and a one smile on
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:47.160]  their faces saying we've done it. But all they will do this time is simply have what they did
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:52.360]  at Bali which is another so-called roadmap which is a way of clicking bureaucratic procedures
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:56.760]  into the long grass for a few years from which I think this time it will never emerge again.
[1:26:56.760 --> 1:27:02.120]  But they have a backup plan which is the Rio Earth Summit which is the 20th anniversary
[1:27:02.120 --> 1:27:06.920]  of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and this time I think they're going to try and put forward
[1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:15.000]  a binding treaty on biodiversity which sounds all terribly gooey and friendly and in that treaty
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:21.240]  on biodiversity they will craftily bundle all the climate stuff in the hope that nobody will notice.
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:28.360]  However, UN bureaucrats and little hitlers and dictators, I will be there in Rio and don't you
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:35.480]  dare try to keep me out by lies and cheating the next time round. I will be reading every draft
[1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:41.720]  of this proposed treaty and if there is any of the nonsense in it that there was in the draft
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:47.720]  which was to be considered by people here at Durban then I will be exposing it all across the world
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:54.520]  yet again. After the Rio Summit in July there is then yet another of these annual conferences of
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:28:00.600]  the parties of the framework of pension on climate change scheduled for Qatar in December of next year
[1:28:01.160 --> 1:28:05.640]  and I don't think that very many people will be going to that at all they'll be lucky to get 5,000
[1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:12.760]  at that and I think this process is now dying on its feet as the science collapses the economics
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:17.720]  has never been there the vast majority of economic opinion says it's much better to do nothing than
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:24.200]  to try to prevent global warming by taxing trading regulation reducing or replacing CO2 and so I think
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:30.600]  that the scare is now pretty much over and the next thing that I will be arranging is to make sure
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:39.240]  that certain focus scientists and focus UN officials who have clearly committed specific frauds
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:46.440]  scientific and economic frauds as part of this so-called process will be reported to the police
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:51.560]  in their respective countries we've got a whole project now to do this and we will be sending
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:57.160]  these people for trial and we hope that the judges on hearing just what they've been up to will send
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:04.440]  those who are guilty of fraud to jail hey everybody Alex Jones here if you're looking for the perfect

[1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:16.200]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned tremendous influence
[1:32:16.200 --> 1:32:22.120]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all
[1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:28.680]  of us as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:35.000]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:40.040]  government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:44.760]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:52.280]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[1:32:52.280 --> 1:32:59.080]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[1:32:59.080 --> 1:33:19.960]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:31.160]  revolution people see it as you know extreme or or aggressive to call for the jailing of these
[1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:36.760]  people but your estimates are well researched about seeing other mainline estimates if you cut the
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:41.080]  carbon by the levels they talked about in kopenhagen and then as i've read over this new document
[1:33:41.080 --> 1:33:46.040]  it's even more draconian in their flight forward we're talking conservatively as you've documented
[1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:53.000]  a billion deaths this is bigger than hitler stalin now uh in all other 20th century mass murder
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:57.720]  combined by an order of three or four times conservatively and we have to understand you
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:34:03.240]  earlier when you mentioned what's going on in africa and latin america it's in major news that
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:09.880]  governments and companies to get these these carbon sinks and money are forcing people off
[1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:15.560]  their land killing people shooting them and the news is kind of like well it's for the earth i
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:20.520]  guess it's okay i mean we've seen the greenies come out the london guardian everywhere and
[1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:26.280]  endorse green fascism they say yes you bet we're going to arrest you for not doing what we say
[1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:33.480]  we're seizing control we're gonna burn down ski resorts yeah we're gonna arrest montan i mean
[1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:37.720]  they are aggressive authoritarians and they're not dressed like the nazis they're not dressed
[1:34:37.720 --> 1:34:43.640]  like the soviets every generation expects it to be looking the same this is our generation's
[1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:48.840]  hitlers they've got to go to prison for the mass murder and eugenics because you know sir at the
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:54.600]  end of the day they're eugenicists they just want to cut uh as state department random 200 says
[1:34:54.600 --> 1:35:00.280]  the the the energy supplies of the third world that is a death sentence i'm sorry to be ranting
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:05.960]  no well i mean i can quite understand because here i am in south africa where the internet works
[1:35:05.960 --> 1:35:11.080]  occasionally we've just found out and 80 percent of south africa is lucky enough to have electricity
[1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:17.800]  12 percent still does but south africa's electricity accounts for 60 percent of all the electricity
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:22.920]  consumed in africa which means that most countries in africa have actually no electricity at all except
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:29.320]  in course of course in the fancy air conditioned government offices so we are seeing a conspiracy
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:35.960]  if you like by the world's governing class the world's increasingly communistic or fascistic
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:41.640]  class politic against the ordinary peoples of the world and of course it's the poor who get hurt
[1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:46.760]  first as you were saying the farmers of uganda who are being kicked off their land and shot if
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:54.440]  they disagree by un troops and Ugandan troops going in to create these entirely fictitious
[1:35:54.440 --> 1:36:00.600]  carbon sinks which are complete nonsense and this is of course a worrying trend now it's very
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:08.280]  difficult to nail them down for genocide for what they're doing at the moment what we can do however
[1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:15.960]  is go after those scientists and bureaucrats who have been peddling deliberate scientific frauds
[1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:21.960]  and there are one or two you can only do sort of one or two clear cases you start with those
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:27.480]  and you put those cases to the police with a lawyer and you say here is the matter of the fraud
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:31.960]  here is how they hope to make money from it here is how much money they've made from it and here
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:36.360]  is why it is definitely a scientific fraud and here is independent scientific evidence that
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:42.520]  it is a fraud and then you get the prosecuting authorities to do their job on a relatively
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:49.800]  small number of really bad scientists who have got away with this so far because they think
[1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:57.080]  that the governing class of the world will protect them but no it won't once we pin down the few
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:03.240]  clearest frauds and report the various people in various countries that have perpetrated these
[1:37:03.240 --> 1:37:09.320]  frauds it'll fall like dominoes once their collars start to be felt just a couple of a couple of
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:16.920]  senior ones they will immediately back off and this entire process will collapse and having seen
[1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:24.680]  the horror and I mean the horror and the genocidal destruction which would which this agreement that
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:31.160]  they're being asked to sign here would entail then it is absolutely now necessary for the sake of the
[1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:39.720]  life of humanity that this process is stopped at once and that's why we're thinking we now have to
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:45.640]  say no more Mr. Nice Guy if you are a scientist that has committed a fraud for the sake of getting
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:51.320]  more funding for yourself or your university or for the sake of going along with this scam
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:57.720]  because it gives you status and position which you wouldn't otherwise have we are watching we
[1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:04.920]  are gathering the evidence and we will see you prosecuted and if you are guilty of fraud then
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:10.040]  we will see you go to jail and in the UK the minimum sentence for the kind of fraud that's
[1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:16.920]  being perpetrated here is at least 10 years imprisonment without the chance of parole absolutely
[1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:21.960]  and look they're guaranteed end up going to prison someday because if they keep carrying out their
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:26.920]  plans the crimes will be so great history shows they'll be resisted and then it won't be prison
[1:38:26.920 --> 1:38:32.120]  they're going to be facing something even more than that I mean these people are true eugenicist
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:37.640]  green nazis anti-human scum and Lord Monkton we really appreciate your tireless effort Chris
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:42.520]  crossing the world you know in your great calling to stand up against these people thank you for
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:45.960]  talking to us and we look forward to talking to you in the future thank you for breaking
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:52.760]  this electronic Berlin wall of media blackout that's happening in the west and we look forward
[1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:59.000]  to talking wonderful description Alex electronic Berlin wall that is exactly what it is these
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:05.560]  Marxist journalists who have captured one by one the newspapers and electronic media of the west
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:13.320]  are now deliberately ganging together to throttle the west that nurtured them and destroy the lives
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:19.960]  of our people and the hopes of our industries and the future of our nations and we must as you
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:30.920]  rightly say fight and fight and fight again to save the rationality and reason and cheerful chaos of
[1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:38.840]  the free market and the prosperity of the west and the democracy which we have until now been
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:43.640]  fortunate to be able to take for granted so god bless you Alex I'm going to hand you over now
[1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:49.640]  to Mark Morano thank you so much Lord Monkton wow it is good to know that those guys are over
[1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:53.640]  there fighting because we wouldn't even have this information if they didn't go to every one of these
[1:39:53.640 --> 1:40:01.800]  conferences and be basically poked and prodded and abused by the miscreant security forces of these
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:07.560]  people and again they're there in the same conference room Mark Morano is now coming over
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:15.880]  via the wonders of the internet and joining us via Skype from Durban South Africa to give us a
[1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:22.200]  breakdown from his perspective on exactly what's happening there but but again this is a
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:29.240]  news blackout on this the most draconian you can read it info wars.com climate depot.com
[1:40:29.240 --> 1:40:35.080]  science and public policy.org the document that reads like something out of a science fiction
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:39.720]  movie if you want to seize total control and now for a quick interview with Mark Morano as well
[1:40:39.720 --> 1:40:43.720]  I know it's late at night over there Mark thank you for joining us and thank you for breaking
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:52.760]  this blackout this electronic Berlin wall so you're back in the nest of authoritarian control
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:58.200]  freaks what's it like? Well as Maxwell Smart used to say we're living in danger every minute
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:01.720]  we're being blacked out threatened by security threatened to be thrown out threatened violence
[1:41:01.720 --> 1:41:07.880]  but we're loving every minute of it this has been a situation where we go around in the media room
[1:41:07.880 --> 1:41:13.560]  Lord Moncton and I and almost to the the mainstream media of the west is not interested they look at
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:18.040]  us as though we're some kind of aliens our simple pitches we're global warming skeptics that are at
[1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:22.200]  this conference conference and we're here to condemn it would you like some balance in your
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:28.440]  reporting all the mainstream media is not interested but the developing world's media is interested
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:35.400]  and I'm talking about Chinese media South African media Indian media and some other African media
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:40.920]  we did it's amazing how the developing world is so receptive to this message in fact we're on the
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:47.320]  front page of the South African newspaper only climate skeptics at this conference so they get it
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:51.720]  but the other media we had a press conference on Wednesday where I released the climate depot
[1:41:51.720 --> 1:41:57.400]  a to z report and I literally from every letter of the alphabet their claims not only are failing
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:04.120]  to materialize the evidence is going the opposite direction we were heckled by uk guardian reporters
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:09.000]  we were heckled by un delegates we were heckled by green peas who planted them in there the
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.960]  un made us start the press conference late and they stopped us you know cutting our time short
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:19.800]  they did not want us there but we persevered we've made our presentation the 61 page report to the
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:26.600]  united nations and I told reporters there that this is now the level of medieval witchcraft
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:33.640]  everywhere you look at the un it says more floods more droughts more tornadoes more hurricanes
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:40.840]  and they all say we must act to stop this they actually believe like the Aztecs that we can slaughter
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:48.360]  people and have acts of legislation to change the weather the un has reduced itself to medieval
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:53.000]  witchcraft at this point where they're claiming they can control the weather this is the most
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:57.560]  bizarre conference of all of them that I've attended they've really morphed into we can
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:02.440]  control the weather now it's not even really that much about global temperatures attention
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:07.640]  shoppers we stay in line you must be scanned and searched before entering the mall area attention
[1:43:07.640 --> 1:43:12.440]  you must disrobe and pass through the scanner at mall security before entering the building hey

[1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:17.400]  they teach school children there shouldn't even be uh seasons now and they cry whenever they see
[1:47:17.400 --> 1:47:21.640]  housing developments i have family this has happened to they say they're murdering the bunny rabbits
[1:47:21.640 --> 1:47:25.720]  they i mean it's incredible brainwashing now it's talking to lord mongton obviously a few
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:30.520]  minutes ago who's there with you and he was describing this as violent death rows do you
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:37.960]  concur with that analysis and what's the overall spirit of these people yeah i mean i've been
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:42.840]  to i've been to pretty much every conference since the earth summit in 2002 and then they've
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:50.040]  always picked exotic locations even bali indonesia in south america and this is by far the conference
[1:47:50.040 --> 1:47:54.920]  with the least amount of energy the least amount of interest and a total boredom has set in because
[1:47:54.920 --> 1:47:59.320]  everyone knew going into this uh that there was going to be no world leaders there president obama
[1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:03.480]  didn't come there were no hollywood celebrities angelina jalee leonardo de capria harrison
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:08.920]  fort even al gore we're all supposed to be here and none of them showed up and this is just it's
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:14.440]  in the death row and i think what's happening now is a retooling of this entire environmental
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:20.360]  thrust and the real conference which i believe will be the end of may into june of 2012 is going to
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:25.480]  be a shift where climate is now going to be rolled into the larger issue of sustainable
[1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:31.320]  development species deforestation and in a way this serves the un purposes much better because
[1:48:31.320 --> 1:48:35.800]  instead of just focusing on the atmosphere and industry now they can control the oceans now
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:42.840]  they can control roadways land use agriculture you name it under that rubric of sustainable
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:48.520]  development they can cover it all and we cannot ever forget that it was republican president
[1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:55.560]  who got us into this the first george h w bush in 1992 went to the first earth summit and committed
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:49:01.240]  the united states to these united nations trees which then led to kiyoto which then led the second
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:06.920]  george bush sent colon pal to the earth summit in johannesburg south africa which i was at the bush
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:12.360]  family has done more to to commit the united states to environmental and united nations
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:18.440]  lunacy than all the democrats combine and we have to look at our two top nominees and we have to get
[1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:25.160]  terrified mit romney and newt gingrich are incapable of standing up to the united nations of standing
[1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:31.640]  up to the international green movement uh mit romney who had john holdren as an advisor is clueless
[1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:37.640]  newt gingrich who has a new book coming out next year has a climatologist named katherine hayhoe
[1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:42.760]  who was a committed and embarrassing global warming alarmist don't be fooled for a moment
[1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:48.600]  by newt gingrich's uh recent uh sounding of skepticism neither of these candidates are equipped
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:53.800]  to handle this and it will be nothing more than a continuation of the disastrous policies of bush
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:58.840]  one and bush two if either of these republicans get in well it's good to see you fired up and
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:03.240]  i've never seen you quite like this certainly you can smell blood with these fraudsters of course it
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:08.600]  was at the Rio de Janeiro conference as you know it was at 92 we're morey strong publicly said
[1:50:08.600 --> 1:50:13.880]  we're going to have a post industrial world we are going to shut down the united states
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:21.080]  we are basically going to carry all of this out and that is exactly uh what they were basically
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:30.680]  able to do so looking at this i wanted to bring up a couple of uh positive points that i've seen
[1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:36.840]  here in the us and that is the epa on its own uh came out and said we're going to shut down most
[1:50:36.840 --> 1:50:40.680]  the coal power plants of course those that aren't owned by insiders like general electric
[1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:45.800]  obamas had to back off on declaring carbon dioxide at least from those as deadly nerve gas poison
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:50.280]  that plants breathe but still he's moving ahead with some of the shutdowns and of course you know
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:56.200]  the epa was going to declare hay dust and any type of dirt or dust on your farm as ten thousand
[1:50:56.200 --> 1:51:01.160]  dollar fines first offense just a total way to shut down small farmers and ranchers the house
[1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:07.560]  passed by a giant margin today the hill newspapers reporting uh that uh that they're not going to
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:13.480]  do that i mean this is clearly just a way for this government mafia to make breathing evil dust on a
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:19.880]  farm evil i mean it is so incredible but more and more this is a selective economic warfare attack
[1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:24.600]  by people that have said they want a post industrial world and who've always hated the free market
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:29.800]  and capitalism yes this is death by bureaucratic bean counters they've gone after ice makers on
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:34.520]  a refrigerator they've gone after our dishwasher our dishwashing liquid down has to be green and
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:38.520]  therefore not cleaning they've gone after the washing machines they've sapped the water and the
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:42.280]  power they've gone after our toilets our shower heads the japanese government's telling the
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:47.000]  citizens that's to go to bed early to prevent global warming uh the un chief has said people
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:51.880]  can't order ice water in restaurants because of the carbon footprint and the level of control
[1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:57.160]  that george orwell didn't contemplate he controls carbon controls life and i will add to that with
[1:51:57.160 --> 1:52:03.800]  the rio earth summit coming up he controls carbon and controls land use policy and uh and even the
[1:52:03.800 --> 1:52:08.840]  and even the oceans controls the world and that's what they're going for and this isn't conspiracy
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:14.040]  talk this is in their documents we're looking at this document one of the most hilarious things
[1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:19.960]  about this 138 page document that lord montan wrote about was they want to stop wars not because
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:24.520]  wars are bad for people not because wars are bloody uh but they want to stop it because of
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:31.560]  war's impact on the atmosphere in other words the greatest reason not to fight a war is concerned
[1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:36.280]  over climate change and global warming this is the level of absurdity we've reached all right
[1:52:36.280 --> 1:52:40.680]  we're getting a bit of a sky break up there from darbensouth africa but that's okay it's great to
[1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:44.840]  even have your have your audio it's kind of an old star trek episode where we're talking to you
[1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:51.160]  every 20 light years away and it's uh it's uh breaking up a piece uh a bit uh going from memory
[1:52:51.160 --> 1:52:56.200]  they're going to pull it up and we might even cut the video in um a few months ago we went to one of
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:00.280]  the smart growth conferences here in town and they had i think the head of the nature conservancy
[1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:05.720]  was there and our yeah mart tercic head of the uh nature conservancy and they went up to him and
[1:53:05.720 --> 1:53:09.960]  so we like to speak to you about coal because they were there saying shut down coal and when they
[1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:14.840]  brought up hey uh well obama said you know in that video clip that he wanted to bankrupt coal what's
[1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:20.680]  your view on that he said whoa i'm not talking to you interview over and ran off like he was a
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:25.800]  vampire confronted with a giant silver cross i mean used to these people would get on the
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:32.920]  offensive if you got on the offensive now they just turn tail and run and more and more they don't
[1:53:32.920 --> 1:53:38.360]  have that crazed power seizing look in their eyes they're trying to regroup as you said and move on
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:44.280]  to i mean a major environmental one and climate organizations are shutting their doors their firing
[1:53:44.280 --> 1:53:51.080]  staffers climate stocks exchanges are collapsing um this was truly subprime science subprime economic
[1:53:51.080 --> 1:53:57.560]  subprime politics but we should never count them out because there's never any or any previous
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:54:02.360]  environmental scare that has this kind of funding backing of the un or backing of the media it's
[1:54:02.360 --> 1:54:08.200]  unprecedented so it doesn't just die and the head of the un regeneratory the of the the climate
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:14.680]  panel is on record of saying global warming is but a symptom of a larger problem and that larger
[1:54:14.680 --> 1:54:19.560]  problem is sustainable development and species extinction they're already on record as doing
[1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:23.720]  the great shift so i think what's going to happen is they're going to regroup climate's not going
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:28.440]  to go away but it's going to be part of a larger picture where they're going to go after every
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.400]  conceivable way that human beings interact and as a former founder of green a co-founder of green
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:39.560]  fees Patrick Morris said the modern environmental movement today is the most anti-human agenda
[1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:45.640]  that we have we have at the UN Congress they had torches solar torches they were trying to pedal
[1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:51.320]  where sub-Saharan Africa people living in huts made of dung aren't offered coal-fired power plants
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:57.400]  which obamas and other environmentalists prevent but they're offered a solar panel solar solar
[1:54:57.400 --> 1:55:03.240]  torches to read by at night this is the perverse way and they're actually people like governor
[1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:07.880]  brown and california who believe the developing world can't develop the environmentalists tell
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:13.160]  them they can't have what we have darn they missed it but we've already raped the earth and they can't
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:16.840]  rape it either they can't make well look look you've been studying this as long as i have but
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:21.000]  i've read all their literature we've got hundreds of their books that i've read erin dykes has read
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:26.280]  here in our office in the last decade i've made films on it the lower level people mean well
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:31.400]  or useful idiots like supporters or linen installer hitler but at the higher levels they say look
[1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:35.640]  well there are too many people we're going to get rid of these brown scum you know margaret
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:40.280]  sanger said we got to hire blacks as our front so we can kill these weeds well we'll say we're
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:46.200]  liberal you know we the american nazis in their words have to pose as liberal to get away with
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:51.240]  this and not let them know that and that's what it is it's a death sentence at the higher levels
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:55.800]  it's about and they say it blocking the third world from developing which by the way actually
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:56:00.440]  makes people have less children but they don't care it's just about cold-bloodedly blocking
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:08.760]  their development and so at the top from my research these are knowingly extremely virulent
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:14.040]  racist people look at obama you know increasing the funding for abortions in africa these are
[1:56:14.040 --> 1:56:20.040]  very very sick people from your research have you found parallels to that or or do you disagree
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:25.560]  no absolutely in fact obama's science advisor john holdren has actually said first of all
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:31.240]  cheap energy is one of the hazards of a pre-society and secondly and most shockingly
[1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:36.120]  he's on record we dug up old newspaper clipping from the early 1970s that aren't available on
[1:56:36.120 --> 1:56:43.880]  lexus nexus or google and then john holdren was vociferously opposing the agricultural revolution
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:50.200]  of norman borlaugh that brought agricultural uh and ended famine throughout asia in the late 1960s
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:56.920]  1970s john holdren opposed it because he didn't want the earth to be able to sustain that many
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:57:03.480]  extra people here was a classic example when confronted in life you have a choice john holdren
[1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:10.360]  chose death john holdren chose anti technology norman borlaugh went on to win the nobel prize
[1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:15.000]  it was one of the most celebrated scientists of our age a man who probably saved hundreds of
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:20.120]  millions of people from starvation and he just died a few years ago he was also a global warming
[1:57:20.120 --> 1:57:26.520]  skeptic but norman borlaugh was a hero john holdren was a eugenicist who now is feeded by
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:31.960]  the mainstream media and obama so it's exactly what is going on and these people are in a high
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:37.800]  office right now unbelievable but but we are seeing the mainstream media's decline right
[1:57:37.800 --> 1:57:44.360]  along with government's approval rating right along with the climate uh panic pushers i mean
[1:57:44.360 --> 1:58:08.280]  certainly they're fleeing forward i think is only going to destroy them uh in the end
