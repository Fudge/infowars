[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.000]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.000 --> 00:30.800]  jones welcome my friends welcome to this live tuesday edition already the first
[00:30.800 --> 00:40.080]  day of june 2010 almost halfway into 2010 it is amazing obviously we're going
[00:40.080 --> 00:46.680]  to be talking a lot about the israeli commando takeover of at least seven
[00:46.680 --> 00:52.800]  ships in the Mediterranean in an international waters yesterday I'm gonna
[00:52.800 --> 01:00.080]  look at this from every different angle and from different perspectives I saw
[01:00.080 --> 01:04.680]  press reports out from Israel saying that there were heavily armed men
[01:04.680 --> 01:12.760]  shooting at them the evidence is pointing towards that being a lie but
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.600]  then some of the a groups were on records saying that they didn't fight in
[01:17.600 --> 01:23.360]  any way and I even saw videos posted by Al Jazeera and press TV stating that
[01:23.360 --> 01:29.080]  then you'd watch the video you can clearly see people beating Israeli
[01:29.080 --> 01:35.320]  commandos over the head with lead pipes what appears to be steel or lead heavy
[01:35.320 --> 01:44.160]  pipes the issue is though is the raid illegal under international law if
[01:44.160 --> 01:50.200]  Israel could prove that there were weapons on board then any government
[01:50.200 --> 01:57.560]  can run blockades if they are given authorization by their own government to
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.920]  do so the question is how will that stand up in the international community but
[02:02.920 --> 02:07.800]  nevertheless images of
[02:08.920 --> 02:18.360]  commandos and attack boats patrol boats bullhorning and firing flash bangs and
[02:18.360 --> 02:25.040]  tear gas and what appears to be machine gun fire onto the ships before the
[02:25.040 --> 02:29.400]  people fight back with lead pipes the media is going to call the commandos
[02:29.400 --> 02:34.320]  heroes they're gonna go people fighting commandos with machine guns cowards
[02:34.320 --> 02:39.720]  just like if the government of Israel or the US nukes I ran if I ran fires back
[02:39.720 --> 02:48.600]  at those B1 bombers or on the B2 bombers with a slingshot with a spitball
[02:48.600 --> 02:55.720]  thrower in fact if I ran so much as cost at the nuclear fireball coming at
[02:55.720 --> 02:59.760]  them there will be screaming and yelling and the media will be pulling its
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.440]  hair around saying we have never seen such an evil if the Iranians take
[03:04.440 --> 03:08.560]  shelter in bunkers as nukes are dropped on them that will be called an act of
[03:08.560 --> 03:14.400]  terrorism if they come and stand in the in the city squares and worship the
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.320]  hydrogen bombs as they detonate a thousand feet above them in an air burst
[03:19.320 --> 03:23.800]  that will be called terror if they take their shirts off so the fireball can
[03:23.800 --> 03:31.200]  kill them better that will be called an act of psychopathic demon terrorism you
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.160]  have to understand how this works those lead pipes are now nuclear weapons on
[03:36.160 --> 03:44.560]  board those cruise ships people with pipes basically have the equivalent of
[03:44.560 --> 03:49.760]  the sword of Damocles a lead pipe is now the most powerful thing in the universe
[03:49.760 --> 03:54.440]  it's more powerful than a black hole it's more powerful than a supernova it's
[03:54.440 --> 03:59.840]  more powerful than the big bang nothing nothing is more powerful than a pipe you
[03:59.840 --> 04:05.480]  understand that and nothing is more satanic and evil and nothing is more
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.240]  destructive okay now I'm really going off the deep end with sarcasm today my
[04:09.240 --> 04:21.560]  friends you know I really don't want World War 3 to start have you noticed
[04:21.560 --> 04:26.320]  all the sudden the north and south of the Korean Peninsula are on the verge of
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.560]  war nuclear war have you noticed all the sudden Israel's got nuclear subs off the
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.280]  coast threatening to nuke Iran have you noticed all the sudden the banks are
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.200]  collapsing all around us and there's all sorts of bizarre financial implosions
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.880]  happening have you noticed just everything's happening at once
[04:42.880 --> 04:47.960]  wonder why that is because there's a quickening taking place and I don't want
[04:47.960 --> 04:53.960]  anybody to die not Americans not people in Israel not Iranians not Gazans how

[08:05.880 --> 08:19.120]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:19.120 --> 08:28.360]  June 1st 2010 thank you for joining us micro vero comes on once a month and he
[08:28.360 --> 08:34.280]  of course is someone who follows the whole Palestinian slash gossip situation
[08:34.280 --> 08:39.120]  very very closely so it should be interesting to get his take on the
[08:39.120 --> 08:44.920]  attack on the flotilla yesterday and there's no doubt it is a military attack
[08:44.920 --> 08:51.880]  I've watched Sky News footage from press TV I've watched Al Jazeera footage I've
[08:51.880 --> 08:57.440]  watched the internet feeds that were recorded live and transmitted over
[08:57.440 --> 09:06.120]  cell phone off of the ships via Skype video and the Israelis pull up in their
[09:06.120 --> 09:13.440]  gunboats and they bare minimum begin firing teargrass rounds and flash bang
[09:13.440 --> 09:18.720]  grenades which can really hurt you in fact they can give you third degree burns
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.200]  over your entire body they have killed people a few times but normally it's a
[09:23.200 --> 09:27.880]  child here in the US they're used on almost every SWAT team entry and they've
[09:27.880 --> 09:32.680]  been thrown into cribs and into children's beds and blown their faces off
[09:32.680 --> 09:36.000]  caught them on fire you've you've of course seen on the news the point is
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.480]  that's a bare minimum now the Arab news and the pro-Palestine news they have
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.680]  clearly been doing some spinning as well so have the Israelis they say they were
[09:46.680 --> 09:55.680]  fired on with machine gun fire immediately before the ships even boarded
[09:55.680 --> 10:02.520]  I find that hard to believe but Israel is bold Israel is wild I think I've seen
[10:02.520 --> 10:08.200]  quotes out of the Knesset about we have to act like wild dogs you know mad dogs
[10:08.200 --> 10:13.360]  to scare the Arab nations so when you hear Ahmed Denizide quoting them as
[10:13.360 --> 10:17.840]  mad dogs that that's a quote out of the Knesset about we're cornered you know
[10:17.840 --> 10:21.320]  they're all against us so we've got to intimidate them by acting like mad dogs
[10:21.320 --> 10:28.560]  or rabid dogs is another quote so that might be the case but but because I
[10:28.560 --> 10:32.520]  happened to have done a little research about naval blockades and boarding
[10:32.520 --> 10:36.440]  parties the way the is the Israelis do it the way the British does it the way
[10:36.440 --> 10:44.520]  the US does it it's all basically exactly the same and that's what happened
[10:44.520 --> 10:49.560]  here but we're gonna go over every angle of this and the geopolitical shock waves
[10:49.560 --> 10:55.400]  that have been caused by it but then more importantly we're gonna discuss what
[10:55.400 --> 11:02.440]  this is distracting us from what this is diverting us from what else is going on
[11:02.440 --> 11:06.680]  the world right now that the threat of nuclear conflagration on the Korean
[11:06.680 --> 11:12.000]  Pence Peninsula is distracting us from the threat of nuclear conflagration
[11:12.000 --> 11:21.360]  between Israel and Iran that could happen at any time all of these financial
[11:21.360 --> 11:27.640]  implosions that are taking place as well what does all of this serve as a
[11:27.640 --> 11:33.120]  distraction for well they all serve as distractions for each other that's what
[11:33.120 --> 11:39.120]  they serve as I mean here's just some of the insane headlines Israel stations
[11:39.120 --> 11:47.800]  nuclear missile subs off Iran times of London here's a AP article Syria
[11:47.800 --> 11:55.040]  conducted nuclear experiments IAEA document Israeli subs with nukes in the
[11:55.040 --> 12:02.880]  Gulf Jerusalem post Turkish sources Israeli advanced target assassination list
[12:02.880 --> 12:08.720]  found on flotilla who knows if that's true I mean that's just some of the type
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.160]  of crazy information going on I mean here's another one out of the
[12:13.160 --> 12:19.640]  Associated Press activists send a new boat to challenge Gaza blockade so so
[12:19.640 --> 12:25.280]  this is accelerating and and blockades have started a lot of wars in the past
[12:25.280 --> 12:31.280]  that's why a month ago Congressman Ron Paul said on the floor of the House of
[12:31.280 --> 12:38.960]  representatives that a blockade of Iran for food medicine and gasoline because
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.600]  they can only refine about half the oil they need half the fuel they need from
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.440]  oil that's why they want nuclear reactors that aren't weapons related
[12:46.440 --> 12:51.480]  that's on record that's an act of war I mean it is an act of war it's an act of
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.200]  war to have a blockade around Gaza can you imagine those hundreds of thousands
[12:56.200 --> 13:02.680]  of people in fact guys pull me the population of Gaza I believe it's right
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.240]  at a million but but I want to make sure my my my memory serves pull me the
[13:06.240 --> 13:19.640]  population of Gaza please thank you so all of that is is happening and I want
[13:19.640 --> 13:28.760]  to go over all the developments here in a moment 1.5 million
[13:28.760 --> 13:37.480]  imagine 1.5 million people huddled in in a caveman level existence with with no
[13:37.480 --> 13:43.400]  industry no jobs and almost no food and they can't get food and for a few hours
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.800]  today Egypt opened their border and tens of thousands were were there waiting and
[13:48.800 --> 13:54.800]  streamed across them in the people one out no one will let them out the Arab
[13:54.800 --> 13:59.120]  countries are using them as a political set piece against Israel Israel wants
[13:59.120 --> 14:04.200]  that land and I mean those Arabs have been there for hundreds of years folks
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.840]  but don't worry they want to leave they can't leave and yeah there are
[14:08.840 --> 14:14.000]  militants that are engaging in a guerrilla war against Israel and Israel goes
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.080]  in there with high-tech tanks and white phosphorus and jet aircraft and blew the
[14:18.080 --> 14:23.160]  daylights out of Gaza 18 months ago and then you've got Congresswoman Cynthia
[14:23.160 --> 14:33.240]  McKinney trying to bring in aid packages in a unarmed boat trying to bring in
[14:33.240 --> 14:37.440]  medicine and food in the Israeli military they didn't board her and turn her
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.680]  around no they they rammed her with a huge ship and and cut off the front of
[14:42.680 --> 14:48.040]  the ship and almost sunk it and then boarded her very aggressive very
[14:48.040 --> 14:51.760]  aggressive under international law and was clearly illegal and then they did
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.800]  that international water yes a country can claim that they believe weapons
[14:56.800 --> 15:00.480]  drugs or other things are being shipped in and interdict a vessel that is
[15:00.480 --> 15:05.000]  declared it is coming in to port there even while it is still international
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.480]  waters but if you open fire on the ship or if you try to sink the ship without
[15:15.480 --> 15:21.360]  trying to peacefully board first that is an act basically a brutal piracy and so
[15:21.360 --> 15:25.400]  this is all going to be analyzed here but regardless it's another big black eye
[15:25.400 --> 15:37.240]  for Israel now while this is happening the world markets are melting down while
[15:37.240 --> 15:45.800]  this is happening world government is openly being established on a planetary
[15:45.800 --> 15:51.280]  scale by the global private central banks that have orchestrated the economic
[15:51.280 --> 16:01.080]  collapse in our society and so I want to open the phones up basically to discuss
[16:01.080 --> 16:05.840]  what's happening in Gaza what happened to the flotilla what's happening on the
[16:05.840 --> 16:12.960]  Korean Peninsula what's happening with the euro Spain losing its triple-a credit
[16:12.960 --> 16:16.480]  rating California on the verge of losing his triple-a credit rating the
[16:16.480 --> 16:19.720]  United States on the verge of losing his triple-a credit rating and of course
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.480]  you know what that means people like I saw one of the state loses his triple-a
[16:23.480 --> 16:27.840]  credit rating or so what if a country loses his triple-a credit rating
[16:27.840 --> 16:38.000]  you pay almost all of your taxes now not to fill potholes not to pay the local
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.720]  power utility that many areas of the country's government owned not for fire
[16:42.720 --> 16:50.520]  and police no you pay most of your taxes on interest to the debt interest to the
[16:50.520 --> 16:58.880]  debt that is manufactured out of thin air that is made up that isn't real they
[16:58.880 --> 17:02.720]  game the world out of this fiat debt that's why they want to get you in debt
[17:02.720 --> 17:07.240]  that's why they send unemployed college students credit cards every week but
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.880]  but once you're stable and aren't in debt they don't send them to you they
[17:11.880 --> 17:17.000]  want to get you into debt it costs them nothing to to to give you the credit
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.240]  it's all made up they gain the world through this fraud well when the US and
[17:22.240 --> 17:28.000]  Spain and Portugal and Greece and Iceland and England and and sub
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.960]  governments within those countries like California loses its triple-a rating you
[17:33.960 --> 17:40.560]  stop paying as a country or as a state or as a city five or ten percent you
[17:40.560 --> 17:46.880]  different variants of that on that scale in interest you start paying 15% 20%
[17:46.880 --> 17:54.520]  30% and then of course the debt that is 14 trillion becomes 30 trillion and then
[17:54.520 --> 17:59.040]  you have no way of paying that so then you get a 30% debt rating and then they
[17:59.040 --> 18:04.400]  give you credit again and then it's 50% and then off a few billion dollars like
[18:04.400 --> 18:09.160]  Nigeria the example I love to use it turns into 50 plus billion paid on one
[18:09.160 --> 18:14.400]  little loan on 100 million you might end up paying back 5 billion over the
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.600]  years on a billion dollar loan you end up paying almost 60 billion actually if
[18:18.600 --> 18:22.600]  you pull the numbers up with another 50 billion owed so over a hundred billion on
[18:22.600 --> 18:27.360]  one billion all made up that's pretty good business if you can get it but see
[18:27.360 --> 18:35.320]  it gets worse because once you're fully in debt and can't pay it back then the
[18:35.320 --> 18:39.040]  globalists come in and take over your entire society and they're a bunch of
[18:39.040 --> 18:43.040]  eugenicists who want you to die they don't want you to be their slave they
[18:43.040 --> 18:48.800]  want you gone they own the earth they're the new world order they want you out of
[18:48.800 --> 18:53.880]  their way a lot of times when the Romans would take over an area they would just
[18:53.880 --> 18:59.920]  kill everybody sometimes they take over a castle fortress in placement over a

[25:14.880 --> 25:19.520]  challenge Gaza blockade and what's Israel gonna do to that they're gonna
[25:19.520 --> 25:24.120]  board that ship and when they encounter resistance they're gonna have
[25:24.120 --> 25:32.120]  another shooting fish in the barrel exercise and it's gonna make Israel look
[25:32.120 --> 25:37.120]  even worse and Israel doesn't care because they've got 400 nuclear weapons
[25:37.120 --> 25:40.240]  and they know how to use them and they're saying we don't care what
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.680]  anybody in the world thinks nobody is bringing anything into the million and
[25:44.680 --> 25:51.840]  a half people in Gaza period and Egypt says we're not gonna let the Gazans in
[25:51.840 --> 26:01.440]  they're gonna die and that's the end of it activists in new boat to challenge
[26:01.440 --> 26:06.240]  Gaza blockade pro-Palestinian activists in another boat to challenge Israel's
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.240]  blockade of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in Egypt declared it was temporarily
[26:10.240 --> 26:15.080]  opening a crossing into Palestine territory after a botched raid on a
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.560]  aid flotilla that ended with Israeli soldiers killing at least nine
[26:19.560 --> 26:24.280]  activists the raid provoked furious international condemnation of Israel
[26:24.280 --> 26:30.280]  raised questions at home and appeared likely to increase pressure to end the
[26:30.280 --> 26:36.760]  blockade that has deepened the poverty of 1.5 million Palestinians living in the
[26:36.760 --> 26:42.000]  Strip those are Palestinians driven out of the heart of Israel in the last 50
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.040]  years Turkey which unofficially supported the flotilla has led the
[26:47.040 --> 26:54.360]  criticism calling the Israeli raid a bloody offensive and here's another
[26:54.360 --> 26:59.200]  headline of the Jerusalem Post Israel faces international fury over flotilla
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.160]  Israel's top officials worked around the clock Monday to quell worldwide
[27:04.160 --> 27:09.680]  censure against its pre-dawn raid on a Gaza bound flotilla in which 10
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.240]  activists were killed that's continuing into Tuesday today like this is the
[27:14.240 --> 27:21.440]  latest information today June 1st Syria Lebanon safe flotilla attack can
[27:21.440 --> 27:33.640]  lead to war Syria Lebanon safe flotilla attack can lead to war Turkish women
[27:33.640 --> 27:37.960]  shout anti-Israeli slogans during a protest in front of the UN house in
[27:37.960 --> 27:42.960]  Beirut on Monday after Israeli commando stormed six ships carrying pro-Palestinian
[27:42.960 --> 27:47.560]  activists and humanitarian aid on a mission to the blockade of Gaza Strip
[27:47.560 --> 27:53.280]  Syrian president Bashir al-Assad and Lebanese Prime Minister said on Monday
[27:53.280 --> 27:57.320]  that Israel's attack on the flotilla of aid bound for Gaza threatens to ignite a
[27:57.320 --> 28:02.680]  war in the region Syria and Lebanon condemn the heinous crime committed by
[28:02.680 --> 28:07.160]  Israel through the brutal attacks on unarmed civilians on board the freedom
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.360]  flotilla both leaders said in a joint statement after a pre-planned meeting in
[28:11.360 --> 28:19.120]  Damascus here's another headline on a CNN Turkey slams Israel for bloody
[28:19.120 --> 28:25.520]  massacre says they're going to dispatch warships with the next flotilla and they
[28:25.520 --> 28:32.400]  don't explain if that means the flotilla that just left to challenge the Gaza
[28:32.400 --> 28:37.560]  blockade I mean you got a million and a half people ladies and gentlemen what a
[28:37.560 --> 28:42.160]  few Kutusha rockets that I guess do kill a few people a year I mean the media
[28:42.160 --> 28:47.960]  calls them fireworks there no they're not fireworks of a 200 pound rocket
[28:47.960 --> 28:53.440]  falls on your head and kills you but at the same time I mean Israel basically
[28:53.440 --> 28:58.200]  leveled large portions of the Gaza Strip leveled killed thousands and
[28:58.200 --> 29:02.720]  thousands tens of thousands of the fact pull up the final death count on I want
[29:02.720 --> 29:07.360]  to be exact about that I believe it was I don't want to go from memory I knew
[29:07.360 --> 29:12.080]  Gaza had about a million people on 1.5 million what will you pull up
[29:12.080 --> 29:21.680]  international estimates on death toll in Israeli bombardment of Gaza or Gaza
[29:21.680 --> 29:25.920]  death toll 2008 should bring it up for us the point is that it's all
[29:25.920 --> 29:31.240]  disproportionate and no matter who you are watching high-tech tanks and war
[29:31.240 --> 29:38.200]  planes bombing civilians in Gaza and and now people fighting off commandos
[29:38.200 --> 29:45.280]  with lead pipes it's not going to look good for Israel and now it's escalating
[29:45.280 --> 29:48.400]  we'll cover that when we get back

[32:05.080 --> 32:08.520]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[32:08.520 --> 32:12.320]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[32:12.320 --> 32:15.480]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[32:15.480 --> 32:19.400]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[32:19.400 --> 32:23.480]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[32:55.800 --> 33:22.600]  barter item this is alex jones for survivalseedbank.com
[33:22.600 --> 33:30.040]  we are back live thank you for joining us so Turkey says they're going to
[33:30.040 --> 33:35.120]  dispatch warships in international waters and that they're going to aid
[33:35.120 --> 33:41.040]  the ships and going into Gaza you see Israel doesn't own Gaza that is a quote
[33:41.040 --> 33:46.920]  Palestinian territory but Israel doesn't recognize the Hamas government
[33:46.920 --> 33:59.960]  there nor do they recognize Hezbollah elements in Lebanon the problem is I
[33:59.960 --> 34:05.120]  happen to have the Jerusalem post in Herets going back six years ago where
[34:05.120 --> 34:12.080]  the Israeli government admitted that in 1974 they created Hamas as a counter
[34:12.080 --> 34:18.400]  balance against Hezbollah now now why would a government create another
[34:18.400 --> 34:23.480]  terrorist organization as they call it and they're calling the people fighting
[34:23.480 --> 34:30.600]  back with metal rods terrorist look folks it's a war it's a war okay it's
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.560]  tribal warfare these people hate each other they've been killing each other
[34:34.560 --> 34:39.240]  for thousands of years how long ago was it was David there how long ago did he
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.120]  kill the Philistine that's how long this has been going on it's been going on
[34:44.120 --> 34:52.560]  for hundreds of years before that it's a war okay let's stop being children now
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.480]  you could pick which side of the war you want to be on me I'm neutral on it I'm
[34:57.480 --> 35:02.600]  sick of it it's mindless idiocy if they if these people would just get along and
[35:02.600 --> 35:07.680]  work together and live together and spend the money on peaceful industry instead
[35:07.680 --> 35:12.960]  of killing each other they'd all be wealthy but we live in a military
[35:12.960 --> 35:16.400]  industrial complex and believe me if you think the US is a military industrial
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.320]  complex the only country in the world per capita that spends more on defense
[35:20.320 --> 35:26.280]  that's per capita is Israel it's all about war that's how their government
[35:26.280 --> 35:30.520]  keeps control their press and their own population is through always having those
[35:30.520 --> 35:36.040]  outside threats and this is not gonna go well for Israel Israel is becoming more
[35:36.040 --> 35:41.040]  and more isolated more and more international pariah and the UN of
[35:41.040 --> 35:45.520]  course will condemn this but the Security Council will veto it because the UN is
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.880]  a fraud and a joke the UN is a globalist organization you know the General
[35:51.880 --> 35:56.440]  Assembly made up of ten horn dictators and corrupt third-world nations it has
[35:56.440 --> 36:05.160]  no power okay and it's just as illegitimate as the Security Council run by
[36:05.160 --> 36:10.320]  the wealthy Western states it's all new world order see people always think oh
[36:10.320 --> 36:14.280]  it's got to be one groups good and the other groups bad uh-uh that's not how
[36:14.280 --> 36:22.520]  history works most of the time you've got Iran run in many cases by a bunch of
[36:22.520 --> 36:26.280]  lunatics you've got Israel run by a bunch of lunatics you've got our
[36:26.280 --> 36:29.480]  government run by a bunch of globalist lunatics you got England run by a
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.240]  bunch of globalist lunatics it's all just criminals what did the founding
[36:33.240 --> 36:36.200]  fathers say they said you better keep government small you better
[36:36.200 --> 36:40.440]  jealously guard liberty and even if you do guard it and fight for freedom you're
[36:40.440 --> 36:43.840]  probably gonna be a slave but if you start thinking you don't have to be
[36:43.840 --> 36:47.520]  involved societally if you start thinking that oh your your work's done
[36:47.520 --> 36:53.200]  you could just ride off into the sunset if you start thinking that you have no
[36:53.200 --> 36:57.800]  place in life except to entertain yourself you're going to become some
[36:57.800 --> 37:03.400]  type of slave all right I'm gonna stop preaching continue with the news so we
[37:03.400 --> 37:08.240]  have Israel stationing nuclear missile subs off Iran times of London three
[37:08.240 --> 37:11.720]  German built Israeli submarines equipped with nuclear cruise missiles are to be
[37:11.720 --> 37:15.080]  deployed to the Gulf near the Iranian coastline the verse has been sent in
[37:15.080 --> 37:18.680]  response to Israel's fears that ballistic missiles developed by Iran
[37:18.680 --> 37:23.840]  Syria and Hezbollah Hezbollah has got a rocket that can maybe shoot 80 miles oh
[37:23.840 --> 37:28.640]  it's just like Saddam could blow up London in 45 minutes oh he's got rail
[37:28.640 --> 37:37.200]  guns he's got satellites he's got EMP weapons oh he's got WMD's nope all lies
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.000]  we know who's got nukes and it's not Iran the first has been sent in response
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.640]  to Israeli fears that ballistic military development by Iran Syria and
[37:48.640 --> 37:54.080]  Hezbollah a political and military organization in Lebanon could hit sites
[37:54.080 --> 38:00.400]  in Israel including air bases and missile launchers the submarines the
[38:00.400 --> 38:08.960]  flotilla of seven dolphin Takuma and Leviathan have visited the Gulf before
[38:08.960 --> 38:15.040]  but the decision has now been taken to ensure a permanent presence of at least
[38:15.040 --> 38:19.840]  one of the vessels the flotilla's commander identified only as Colonel
[38:19.840 --> 38:25.280]  Oh told an Israeli newspaper we are an underwater assault force we're operating
[38:25.280 --> 38:29.680]  deep and far very far from our borders each of the submarines has a crew of
[38:29.680 --> 38:35.200]  35 to 50 commanded by a colonel capable of launching a nuclear cruise missile all
[38:35.200 --> 38:40.600]  by himself oh yeah in the US you got to have two people no not with Israel
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.920]  400 nukes and they had a member of the Knesset what was it five years ago
[38:44.920 --> 38:48.840]  threatened in nuke Europe if they didn't give more reparations to Israel I mean
[38:48.840 --> 38:55.800]  look folks now it's come out Israel admits they gave nukes to South Africa
[38:55.800 --> 39:03.840]  because South Africa gave them race specific bio weapons I mean and in
[39:03.840 --> 39:09.080]  Israel is wild ladies and gentlemen you've seen this over and over and over
[39:09.080 --> 39:14.840]  again now you've got wild card kernels running around with cruise missiles that
[39:14.840 --> 39:18.200]  can go thousands of miles with nukes let me tell you I'm concerned about our own
[39:18.200 --> 39:21.440]  military with nukes I'm concerned about the Russians I'm concerned about Kim
[39:21.440 --> 39:25.360]  Jung Il I'm concerned about South Africa I'm concerned about the French I'm
[39:25.360 --> 39:29.680]  concerned about the British what was it four years ago three years ago we had
[39:29.680 --> 39:35.600]  two nukes cruise missiles go missing from Minot Dakota just remember that it was
[39:35.600 --> 39:42.560]  in the news our own government can't keep all of the stinking things I'm
[39:42.560 --> 39:46.440]  actually got a headache right now just just just even thinking about this the
[39:46.440 --> 39:49.480]  world is getting more and more insane by the minute and notice as I said at the
[39:49.480 --> 39:53.560]  start of the show it's as if someone flipped a white switch and now you've
[39:53.560 --> 40:02.000]  got Turkey with a huge military very well-trained very serious very western
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.280]  ladies and gentlemen very European wasn't too long ago that it was Constantinople
[40:07.280 --> 40:18.800]  ladies and gentlemen not Istanbul and they're now talking about this causing a
[40:18.800 --> 40:24.040]  war with Israel Turkey's been their ally you understand folks that that Egypt's
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.120]  their ally and saying this could cause a war same thing's coming out of Jordan
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.200]  right now that is in a lip lock with Israel because what does this do when
[40:32.200 --> 40:36.480]  Israel does this the Arab populations of all these countries and the Muslim
[40:36.480 --> 40:43.680]  populations get more restless more ready to burn cities and what is the
[40:43.680 --> 40:48.760]  political correctness done brought in masses of Islamist masses of Muslims
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.600]  into the Western world and look this is a political correct talk this is an
[40:52.600 --> 40:57.040]  anti-political correct talk this is an anti-muslim talk here this is real
[40:57.040 --> 41:03.520]  meat and potatoes geopolitical board what is on the board I'm a political
[41:03.520 --> 41:07.920]  atheist I love it when Gerald Salenta explains that I agree I don't look at
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.440]  the Republicans and say I owe something to them and so I'll tailor what I say
[41:11.440 --> 41:15.640]  to fit into that paradigm or I'm a Democrat or I'm pro-Israel or I'm
[41:15.640 --> 41:21.280]  anti-Israel or I'm I'm pro-US or I'm anti-US I don't let that color my
[41:21.280 --> 41:25.680]  analysis I'm pro-US because our bill of rights and Constitution is the best and
[41:25.680 --> 41:28.840]  because it's my heritage and because the globalist want to dismantle my
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.840]  Republic but somebody can't just wrap something in an American flag and tell
[41:33.840 --> 41:38.600]  me launching a bunch of illegal wars that bankrupt my country is good for my
[41:38.600 --> 41:48.680]  country and tell me that they say what's patriotic uh-uh no again micro vero
[41:48.680 --> 41:52.520]  is coming up we're gonna be discussing this wedding but but now you've got all
[41:52.520 --> 42:00.080]  these countries Syria Lebanon Turkey I mean Turkey does not ever bluff ladies
[42:00.080 --> 42:06.520]  and gentlemen I mean Turkey is serious business very serious and Turkey now
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.640]  says they're gonna dispatch warships with another flotella and they're gonna
[42:10.640 --> 42:14.760]  go into Gaza and you know what's gonna happen if the Israelis attack that
[42:14.760 --> 42:19.800]  what are they gonna say they thought the Turkish ships were were Egyptian again
[42:19.800 --> 42:25.680]  like the USS Liberty in 67 well they're not at war this time with Egypt I mean
[42:25.680 --> 42:30.000]  how are they gonna finagle that how are they gonna wrangle that ladies and
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.640]  gentlemen how are they gonna finesse that it isn't gonna happen and the
[42:34.640 --> 42:41.880]  United States has got nukes inside of Turkey and Turkey in the last two years
[42:41.880 --> 42:46.160]  it's it's come out that a shadow state run by Europe and the US has basically
[42:46.160 --> 42:51.160]  been running things there and has been overthrown so see Turkey and there's
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.600]  some mainstream reports saying Israel did this to the Turkish flagged ship
[42:55.600 --> 43:01.360]  this this this converted huge cruise ship because they're mad that Turkey's
[43:01.360 --> 43:04.600]  actually gotten a real government that isn't a puppet government look I don't
[43:04.600 --> 43:17.840]  know I just know that that those Mohammed cartoons caused Muslims to burn a
[43:17.840 --> 43:23.840]  lot of major buildings in major cities and so what is the method of the
[43:23.840 --> 43:28.200]  globalist madness you've got all these pro is what I don't like the Israeli
[43:28.200 --> 43:34.960]  lobby folks because I mean the truth is the truth the Israeli lobby to a man
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.760]  lobbies for gun control in the US but every Israeli gets to own guns I don't
[43:39.760 --> 43:48.040]  appreciate that Rahm Emanuel Chucky Schumer Lieberman you know how come
[43:48.040 --> 43:54.240]  Israel gets to have guns but we don't hmm I don't like that keep your hands off
[43:54.240 --> 44:01.800]  my guns I don't like the fact that the Israeli lobby is constantly lobbying for
[44:01.800 --> 44:06.880]  open borders in this nation and lobbying to bring more Muslims into the country
[44:06.880 --> 44:11.360]  now again I don't dislike Muslims I've had Muslim friends in high school and
[44:11.360 --> 44:15.600]  college and I'm against them being abused and tortured and and for preemptive
[44:15.600 --> 44:18.760]  wars against their countries and leveling their nations but I am for
[44:18.760 --> 44:23.120]  common sense I mean if we're not gonna be friends with the Muslims and and my
[44:23.120 --> 44:26.440]  government is gonna be running continual wars of genocide against them
[44:26.440 --> 44:30.920]  what in tarnations are we doing bringing them in here that's what I mean it
[44:30.920 --> 44:36.760]  makes no sense until you get the wider game of order out of chaos the globalist
[44:36.760 --> 44:40.240]  don't care about Israel they don't care about Egypt they don't care about the
[44:40.240 --> 44:43.680]  United States they don't care about England the globalist are one thing
[44:43.680 --> 44:49.880]  ruthless they always play different groups off against each other I see down
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.720]  the road Israel being flushed down the toilet by the New World Order oh I see
[44:53.720 --> 45:00.000]  that in the cards and I see Israel playing right into these hands because
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.520]  the more sophisticated I get in my research the bigger a headache I get
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.960]  because it is so complex ladies and gentlemen but I'll tell you this is bad
[45:07.960 --> 45:12.240]  news and what is Israel doing they've let other aid convoys in there
[45:12.240 --> 45:18.520]  intelligently last year okay and they've got spies don't you know out of 800
[45:18.520 --> 45:22.960]  people on these six to seven ships some says six some say seven some reports a
[45:22.960 --> 45:28.920]  700 some a 800 I don't know 700 plus people on at least six ships the Israelis
[45:28.920 --> 45:32.880]  always infiltrate everything I guarantee you they had people all over these
[45:32.880 --> 45:37.840]  ships if there really were supposed weapons on these ships being delivered
[45:37.840 --> 45:41.600]  to Gaza they could have followed them off and had airstrikes called in on
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.000]  where they were being delivered that would have been the intelligent way to
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.760]  handle this from a pro Israeli perspective if you can put yourself in
[45:49.760 --> 45:53.840]  that position that's what you do to have a geopolitical understanding you don't
[45:53.840 --> 45:56.880]  just sit there and look at the world from your perspective whatever that is
[45:56.880 --> 46:00.960]  put yourself in the Israeli perspectives there is no I remember last week
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.720]  talking about this flotilla I said there's no way Israel's gonna attack that
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.560]  there's no way this will be a PR disaster they're gonna let those ships
[46:09.560 --> 46:14.880]  land and then if there's any weapons go after them unless they're wanting to
[46:14.880 --> 46:18.280]  kick off a new war I said to myself and we talked about it here around the
[46:18.280 --> 46:25.760]  the office but what it is real do the it looks like Hutzpah looks like arrogance
[46:25.760 --> 46:30.640]  whatever word you want to use no it's not they want a new war as a political
[46:30.640 --> 46:39.280]  distraction for Washington a new Gaza conflict a new Lebanon conflict they
[46:39.280 --> 46:42.600]  want the Middle East erupting into flames so there's a pretext to keep our
[46:42.600 --> 46:51.880]  forces there notice how suddenly a submarine gets blown up or notice
[46:51.880 --> 47:01.040]  suddenly supposedly a suicide sub a suicide squad delivers a a suicide
[47:01.040 --> 47:04.760]  torpedoes what they were first calling it and then it looks like a German
[47:04.760 --> 47:08.880]  torpedo oh yeah the Germans are the third biggest weapon sellers in the world
[47:08.880 --> 47:13.840]  but there's no record of North Korea ever buying German torpedoes but they do
[47:13.840 --> 47:17.440]  sell to basically anybody so it could have been sold to one country like China
[47:17.440 --> 47:20.440]  and then they could have sold it but China supplies most of North Korea's
[47:20.440 --> 47:25.160]  weapons and they've got plenty of their own torpedoes just like they've got
[47:25.160 --> 47:29.480]  plenty of you know everything else they're manufacturing from iPods to cars
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.920]  they don't need anybody's help making torpedoes over there that's very
[47:33.920 --> 47:40.520]  suspicious and now Japan's having to back off kicking u.s. forces out so when
[47:40.520 --> 47:45.680]  you really study things it it looks bad in any way you slice it my friends
[47:45.680 --> 47:51.640]  any way you cut this the whole world is getting crazier and crazier by the minute
[47:51.640 --> 47:58.600]  and look at these other articles Turkey future Gaza aid ships will have
[47:58.600 --> 48:04.320]  military escorts Turkey promises to send supplies to Gaza with naval escort
[48:04.320 --> 48:10.240]  what are you gonna do blow up the Turkish warships of course you better come
[48:10.240 --> 48:15.920]  with more than just missile boats because the the Turks have got high-tech
[48:15.920 --> 48:20.640]  u.s. weapons and of course you know that full well don't you here's another one
[48:20.640 --> 48:29.040]  Netanyahu defends aid ships raid regrets loss of life and then he goes
[48:29.040 --> 48:33.680]  through to say we regret the loss of life he said in an Ottawa during a meeting
[48:33.680 --> 48:36.960]  he cut it short yesterday flew back to Israel was gonna meet with Obama today
[48:36.960 --> 48:40.640]  he insisted the Israeli forces had acted to defend themselves telling reporters
[48:40.640 --> 48:44.560]  later that the flotilla was seeking to smuggle into Gaza rockets or other
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.120]  weapons to attack the Jewish state he said he said I give my complete backing
[48:49.120 --> 48:53.160]  to the army the soldiers and commanders who acted to defend the state and to
[48:53.160 --> 48:59.360]  protect their lives he added well I'll say this the one thing that really
[48:59.360 --> 49:04.120]  discredits the the people on the flotilla is this I read the first reports
[49:04.120 --> 49:09.440]  yesterday I saw the Al Jazeera and press TV reports and they said unprovoked the
[49:09.440 --> 49:15.960]  Israelis were attacking them when they when they landed on the ship from the
[49:15.960 --> 49:20.800]  helicopters down the ropes well I've seen the unedited it's all up on
[49:20.800 --> 49:23.400]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we're gonna play some of the next
[49:23.400 --> 49:27.880]  hour I've seen the footage and those Israeli commandos come down the ropes
[49:27.880 --> 49:32.320]  with their weapons slung and the people in the boats run up and beat them and
[49:32.320 --> 49:35.200]  beat them and beat them and beat them and beat them and beat them and beat them
[49:35.200 --> 49:39.800]  and beat them and then you start hearing shooting now it's it's an
[49:39.800 --> 49:46.960]  aggressive act a piratical act to attack these aid ships and it does look
[49:46.960 --> 49:51.280]  like and again we don't know the truth yet that the Israelis were firing
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.880]  tear gas and flashbangs at the boats and that can kill you that can hurt you
[49:55.880 --> 49:59.840]  very easily and that does make people angry red-blooded men get mad when that
[49:59.840 --> 50:06.240]  goes on and you know these these men on these ships had courage to be fighting
[50:06.240 --> 50:12.040]  men in heavily armored commando uniforms with body armor with automatic
[50:12.040 --> 50:15.960]  weapons and so a bunch of them died some numbers are above 20 mainstream media
[50:15.960 --> 50:21.400]  saying 9 right now I don't know because the mainstream media normally lies
[50:21.400 --> 50:26.000]  about basically everything at first and later the truth comes out but as the
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.360]  sun folds will continue to follow it but the issue is what's gonna happen when
[50:30.360 --> 50:37.440]  Turkey brings in other ships this time with missile cruisers and destroyers
[50:37.440 --> 50:45.360]  protecting them I mean is this gonna be the start of war a huge war against
[50:45.360 --> 50:52.760]  Israel with Turkey involved Turkey bordering of course northern Iraq and
[50:52.760 --> 50:56.840]  you got the Iranians hopping mad like a bees nest right now this isn't pretty

[54:19.840 --> 54:25.320]  and you're not gonna talk about just let me know hi micro vero is coming up and
[54:25.320 --> 54:29.160]  then I'm gonna open the phones up in the next hour while he's on with us on any
[54:29.160 --> 54:38.000]  news item any issue you wish to discuss 1-800-259-9231 is the toll free number
[54:38.000 --> 54:50.800]  to join us 800-259-9231 so finishing up here with the situation with the
[54:50.800 --> 54:58.560]  flotilla being attacked you separately now have the United Nations and Israel
[54:58.560 --> 55:05.040]  claiming Iran has over two tons of enriched uranium two bombs worth that
[55:05.040 --> 55:12.320]  is the Jerusalem post so you notice this is being put out right on the eve of a
[55:12.320 --> 55:20.240]  potential attack on Iran Israel saying we may attack Iran with nuclear weapons
[55:20.240 --> 55:26.000]  preemptively and Bush said the US may do this Obama has left the door open in
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.120]  the last few months recently to this you imagine being Iran and so Iran kind of
[55:32.120 --> 55:35.440]  buckled they said okay we'll give the uranium to France we'll give it to
[55:35.440 --> 55:40.560]  Turkey we'll give it to Brazil who've all got peaceful reactors they can enrich
[55:40.560 --> 55:47.000]  it and then and then if they enrich it there's no way Iran can make a nuke with
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.640]  it you understand it's it's like running diesel on a regular gasoline engine it
[55:51.640 --> 55:57.760]  doesn't work a hundred percent and Israel got even more upset and Obama got
[55:57.760 --> 56:01.440]  even more upset we covered this last week and said okay that's it we're
[56:01.440 --> 56:07.120]  definitely attacking you are not going to have peaceful reactors and then Iran
[56:07.120 --> 56:13.400]  says but we only have enough refining capacity for about half the gasoline we
[56:13.400 --> 56:18.760]  need we have plenty of oil but we don't have the refineries we don't have the
[56:18.760 --> 56:24.480]  money and the globalists say we don't care what you do pal you kicked us out in
[56:24.480 --> 56:28.680]  53 and don't get and didn't give Anglo-American oil the British oil company
[56:28.680 --> 56:33.160]  now BP everything hits over we're going to kill you what is there you don't
[56:33.160 --> 56:36.840]  understand it doesn't matter if you put moderates in like five years ago
[56:36.840 --> 56:40.720]  doesn't matter if you put radicals in like augment in a sheet it doesn't matter
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.720]  what you do we want to kill you don't you understand we need a boogeyman and
[56:45.720 --> 56:50.760]  you're it we gave nukes to Kim Jong-il we gave nukes to Pakistan this is what
[56:50.760 --> 56:58.080]  we do and we're going to attack you do you understand that scum and we're going
[56:58.080 --> 57:02.520]  to rob the American people to pay for it and we're going to have Goldman Sachs
[57:02.520 --> 57:06.240]  steal everything and we're gonna build prisons everywhere because we're the
[57:06.240 --> 57:10.240]  new world order and we do whatever we want and that's just the end of it do
[57:10.240 --> 57:20.440]  you understand that's the way it is and it goes on and on from there Israeli
[57:20.440 --> 57:25.080]  commandos gun down 19 peace activists and raid on Gaza ships with 28 Britons
[57:25.080 --> 57:29.920]  on board that's the mail online this is not going well for Israel and meanwhile
[57:29.920 --> 57:35.760]  they have now are saying that more ships are about to leave in a flotilla with
[57:35.760 --> 57:42.960]  warships of Turkey great Israel you're gonna fight Turkey to how about
[57:42.960 --> 57:46.560]  everybody just have the whole world line up I guess you've got the nukes we
[57:46.560 --> 57:53.520]  have a nuclear shootout how about Russia Israel how about that how I guess so
[57:53.520 --> 57:57.280]  Israel you've got the hoodspot I've never seen anything like it Israel with
[57:57.280 --> 58:03.160]  NATO and the United States two years ago on 888 on record launches a sneak
[58:03.160 --> 58:09.000]  attack into South Ossetia attacking Russia and then Russia rolled in with
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.400]  mobile nuke launchers and threatened the the head of the Russian military went on
[58:13.400 --> 58:18.880]  TV and said we're preparing for theater nuclear war in this theater and if
[58:18.880 --> 58:21.840]  anybody responds we're gonna have to go to full nuclear war with the United
[58:21.840 --> 58:26.760]  States in Europe that was on Russian television we played it here nuclear war
[58:26.760 --> 58:32.440]  because Dick Cheney thinks it's a big man to do that oh these globalists have
[58:32.440 --> 58:36.360]  all the women all the money all the power they they enjoy war they want

[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:25.160]  Austin Texas Alex Jones well Michigan is considering a law to license
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.600]  journalists the same thing has already started up in Washington state tyranny's
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:37.120]  here folks Israel now has three nuclear subs German belt with nuclear cruise
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.200]  missiles nuclear weapon tip cruise missiles warhead tip cruise missiles off
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.040]  the coast of Iran threatening to nuke them at any time Turkey's saying this
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.480]  could cause war so is Syria and Lebanon Turkey says they're dispatching warships
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.640]  with the next flotilla because a Turkish flag ship was attacked it's an
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.320]  act of war folks like Ron Paul said a blockade is an act of war Gaza is
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:09.000]  sovereign and you know again folks this isn't some macho talk or what side
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.600]  you're on okay I want to stop war I don't hate Israel okay and and and and I
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.040]  don't hate the Palestinians the average person over there just wants to live in
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.200]  peace and the Arab governments have done a lot to not let Gazans get out into
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.640]  Egypt and other areas but look at Egypt can they take a million and a half
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:35.420]  refugees on but this attack here's the 64 million dollar question are the
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:44.640]  explosions and gunfire we hear rubber bullets flash bangs and tear gas when
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:51.200]  the Israeli naval gunboats are attacking or are they real rounds if
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:57.160]  they're led or full metal jacket rounds this is an act of war an act of piracy
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:04.440]  an act of just criminality it is an act of aggression it's what the
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:13.040]  Nuremberg code covers now if they knew weapons were being shipped in we're
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.480]  going to break and come back with microvaro joining us video Skype if they
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.120]  have absolute proof weapons were being brought into Gaza under international
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.760]  law just like the 1961 Cuban Missile Crisis they could go out in
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.280]  international waters and stop those ships but it's very specific they could
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:34.000]  fire across the bow they didn't stop they could shoot the rudder off but if
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.720]  they fired on anybody on that unarmed ship it is a serious crime now the
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:45.240]  Arabs the Arab media did report that no one hit the Israelis or stabbed them
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.920]  there's now stills and video shot by Al Jazeera by press TV so by Arab friendly
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.640]  media Muslim freedom friendly media showing them beating the commandos as
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:03:00.960]  they hit the deck now if the Israelis were firing at them even with flash
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:06.400]  bangs those can kill you what do you expect the people to do I and I made the
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.720]  joke at the start of the show a sick joke truly not even a joke it's dark satire
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:18.640]  to illustrate something you have Ahmed Denizide fired at an Israeli bomber at
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:26.320]  at 80,000 feet if at 80,000 feet a bomber dropped a air burst hydrogen 50
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:32.200]  megaton bomb on Tehran as that plane flies over to Ahmed Denizide or even
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:41.240]  an Iranian child fired at it with a slingshot the media would call the
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:45.120]  child a coward and would call the slingshot the most deadly weapon in the
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.880]  known galaxy they call it a black hole projecting weapon or something you know
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:54.440]  they call it a you know end of days devil weapon they you know they call
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:01.320]  it you know just the ultimate demon and so that's the new situation and the
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:06.400]  world sees the hypocrisy whether you support Israel or not look armored
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:13.600]  ships coming up to unarmed former cruise ships and attacking them and
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:19.280]  commandos coming on board and people fighting them with pipes humans on
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.840]  average are going to emotionally side with the people fighting with stones
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.640]  and rocks and pipes and that's why the whole world is turning against Israel
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.840]  whereas 30 years ago when the Arabs were always attacking Israel the people
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.040]  sided with Israel because they were the little guy they were the underdog
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.600]  Israel is not the underdog in all of this and and and Israel's talking about
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:44.880]  nuclear war now this is a very serious situation so we're gonna get micro veros
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.200]  that take on this when we get back on the other side of this break and your
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.960]  phone calls Webster Tarple is gonna give us his take coming up in the last hour
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:05:01.240]  today stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.840]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.520]  Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.200]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.240]  and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.360]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:24.760]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an

[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.520]  show host also is the website what really happened dot com our websites are info
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.040]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com and he is really a lot of research on
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:31.400]  the Israeli slash Palestinian conflict what's been happening in Gaza what's
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.160]  been going on in Lebanon but I specifically want him to give us his
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.840]  take today and I'm going to speak to this and take your phone calls at 800
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:47.680]  259 92 31 on where you see all this going because you know a lot of people
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.360]  don't pay attention to what's happening in Israel you know this tribal warfare
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:54.560]  has been going on for thousands of years between the Israelis and the
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:01.320]  Palestinians and it's only intensifying but people kind of get mentally worn out
[01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:07.760]  they get exhausted and they stop paying attention but this is a new escalation
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.480]  with Turkey not not just Lebanon or Syria the usual suspects threatening war
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:18.160]  saying this could cause war but Turkey this was a Turkish flagged former
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:24.880]  cruise ship attacked anyway you slice it in in international waters and Turkey
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:33.640]  is angry a top ally along with the United States of Israel so a huge
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:37.960]  political shift here and so we're going to be discussing that and coming up
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:43.240]  later Michigan considers law to a licensed journalist this is in the
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:47.720]  Associated Press Reuters and Fox News and what's scary is the media is
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.480]  reporting it like it's reasonable and other states are moving as well to where
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:56.160]  I won't be able to be on the air now I have to have a government license they
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.760]  have to approve and that's what the New York Times and also many members of the
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:06.840]  White House are Obama's Zars are saying you have to be vetted we have to decide
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.760]  or we're gonna put messages up on your website government pop-ups that say
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.440]  stuff isn't true or that directs you to government or other media of course that
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:21.280]  was in the news last week we're kicking their hind ends they are going to try
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.440]  this so you better enjoy the internet while it's here and you better use it
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.080]  to wake people up while it's here because the new media is destroying the old media
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.640]  and so you got the mainstream media teamed up with government wanting to
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:36.400]  block that so we'll get Mike Rivera's take on that also I had a lady coming in
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.800]  next hour a friend of my wife but she chickened out and I don't blame her a
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.120]  lot of people do that's why this country's fallen apart even though when I
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.960]  said oh look I won't use your real name her daughter went to one of the
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:58.280]  suburbs in Austin first grade and I was talking to her at a birthday party this
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:05.360]  weekend for my daughter and it was out in Lakeway and they basically turned the
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.400]  kids against the parents they have them coming home and crying every time they
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.640]  see a development they're taught that bunny rabbits are dying other mothers
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:14.400]  were there saying yeah that's why I took my kids out of school we know because of
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:17.640]  a homeschooling group that they come in and don't tell the kids that it's a
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.240]  drill and they turn the lights off and a man in a mask comes in with a gun but
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.520]  she checking out to come on the show and that's okay because she also had the
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:33.520]  document but separately I had this out of the Washington Post where they say
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.320]  that under a red level terror emergency your children will be taken to FEMA
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:42.480]  centers and that's in the Washington Post we wrote an article about it four
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.160]  years ago but the point is she got one of these at that at that elementary
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:52.160]  school okay so this is part of a FEMA operation well guess what even though she
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.840]  won't come on the show today I have mainstream news articles about it
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.560]  separately in other parts of the country so that's coming up but enough of me
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.200]  let's go to Mike Rivera joining us via video Skype if you're a prison planet
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:07.760]  dot TV viewer if not he'll be joining you via the audio spectrum for radio
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:13.440]  listeners Mike let's run through the gamut break down what you see happening
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.440]  from the latest info what really happened if you have a clearer picture I
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.120]  know it's still somewhat foggy of what happened to the flotilla yesterday and
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:26.240]  what this is going to do internationally well the situation with the
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.360]  flotilla as you say it's very murky Israel has a complete media blackout
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.840]  people are not being allowed to talk to the the prisoners we don't even have a
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.680]  complete list of the number of the names of the people who've been killed
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.880]  although the number is now 20 what we're being told that died in this
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:50.040]  situation we are aware of what happened mostly because of one live video feed
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.520]  that was able to get off the ship while it was being attacked in that video feed
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:58.600]  apparently the Israeli troops that were coming on board were carrying these
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:04.080]  pre-printed target lists of activists that were supposed to be killed and we
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.600]  just had a member of the Nesset basically go public saying that Israel
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.320]  wanted to have a lot of deaths as a deterrent to any more of these blockade
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:15.360]  runners but the bottom line is this is clearly a violation of international law
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.480]  when you are a ship at sea that deck of your ship is the sovereign territory of
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.680]  the nation whose flag you fly it's like a foreign embassy when you set foot on
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.440]  the deck of a ship flying the flag of the United States of America you are
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.600]  setting foot on US territory you set foot on the deck of a ship flying the
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.440]  Turkish flag you are setting foot on Turkish territory if you do so without
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:39.880]  the permission of the captain or the government that is an invasion and an
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:44.920]  act of war now the bottom line is that Israel's claims that these humanitarian
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.240]  aid ships were filled with weapons is complete nonsense they had no proof of
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.960]  it whatsoever the one photo that Israel has put out so far to show the weapons
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.280]  that were found on board the ship it's basically wooden poles and kitchen knives
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.400]  and Israel is saying these are weapons because the people of Gaza could use
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:07.680]  them to attack you know Israelis you know with these these ceramic cooking
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.760]  knives and stuff like this well that's why I said Atari had weapons of mass
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.600]  destruction and was I mean weapons of mass destruction are not handguns but
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.400]  this isn't even handguns it's it's it's it's cooking utensils now so I guess
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:25.880]  everybody's got to be nuked because now a cooking knife is a weapon of mass
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:31.600]  destruction is now reason to start opening fire on the peace activists and
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.640]  the bottom line is while the world is outraged I don't think anybody is
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:40.600]  surprised because Israel is acting true to form I mean robbers will rob rapists
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.120]  will rape and Israel commits war crimes that's been it's it's history but I
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:48.560]  think what Americans are really angry about right now and I'm getting this
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:51.840]  basically when my wife and I went shopping for groceries yesterday we were
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:55.480]  talking to just the ordinary people in the supermarket they were aware of what
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.960]  was going on and their their attitude was well we expect Israel to do this but
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.760]  they were waiting for the U.S. government to take some kind of decisive
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:09.680]  action regarding the nine U.S. citizens who were kidnapped in international
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.760]  waters by this act of war and now we're seeing all you know the the U.S. once
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.400]  again at the United Nations Security Council is trying to stifle criticism
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.080]  of Israel and is working to protect Israel and as far as those U.S. citizens
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.440]  in Israeli prisons apparently they're not important now this is a far cry from
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:33.520]  1904 when a businessman named Ian Perticaris was kidnapped in Morocco
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:37.760]  by a gentleman by the name of rice Zuley and president Theodore Roosevelt sent
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:43.800]  seven battleships with orders to invade Morocco if Perticaris was not
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:48.520]  ultimately returned which he was and I think the American people are wondering
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.760]  whose side is the federal government on when I mean you know where this week
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.120]  we're coming up again on the anniversary of the attack on the U.S.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.280]  of this liberty where Israel killed all these American sailors and then
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.560]  president Johnson not only did not hold Israel to account but participated in
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.200]  this cover-up of saying oh it's just an accident and so forth and so on and
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.680]  we're seeing a repeat of that sellout once again and at this point and I've
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.400]  been saying this this entire election season American needs leaders who are
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.040]  going to put America first second and third and a government cannot serve two
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.480]  masters if we have a government that is serving Israel they cannot serve the
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.760]  best interests of the American people and you only need to look around at our
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:29.720]  crumbling infrastructure and our destroyed economy and all the other
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:33.120]  evils that have descended upon the United States of America under the
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.640]  guidance of the government that is still sending money to Israel even though
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.160]  the British press just published documents proving that Israel is not
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.680]  only a nuclear power they've been trying to sell nuclear warheads to regimes
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.680]  like apartheid South Africa and billions of dollars of our tax money
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:52.080]  continue to pour into Israel even though it's illegal to do so under U.S. law
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.320]  because of those nuclear weapons and the American people are starting to say
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:01.920]  okay whose side is the government on let me ask this question I mean the
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.600]  situation with all these countries threatening potential war with Israel
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:11.080]  namely Turkey Turkey says they're gonna dispatch warships with the next flotilla
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.960]  that's set to leave in the next day or so I mean is Israel gonna attack Turkish
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:21.400]  warships I think they very well might I mean culturally and nationally Israel is
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:25.320]  never able to back down they're never ever to able to admit error if they let
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.320]  this next flotilla through to Gaza and nothing bad happens because of it then
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.400]  Israel is going to be seen for having been wrong to have imposed such a
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:38.240]  blockade for the last going on four years in defiance of a UN resolution I
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.720]  might add the United Nations has repeatedly including the Security
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:47.040]  Council called on Israel to lift the blockade Israel refuses to do so and so
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.600]  I think that yes if Turkey sends armed warships to escort the aid fleet there
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.520]  may be a shooting war between Israel and Turkey and I want to point out one
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.560]  more thing Turkey is a member of NATO yes so is Israel but Israel has attacked
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.240]  a NATO nation over this last weekend and under the rules of the NATO treaty an
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:11.240]  attack on one NATO nation is an attack on them all so every member of NATO has
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.600]  been attacked by Israel under the terms of that contract I am waiting for the
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.040]  NATO nations in particular the United States of America to stand up and say
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:28.160]  you are not allowed to attack NATO now going back here Mike I do think though
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:35.400]  there's there's spent on both sides because you have the pro-gaza group on
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:40.400]  the news saying we didn't fight back in any way and it's not true that we were
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:45.360]  beating people with poles and trying to stab them but there are images of
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.320]  people running around with knives and there are images of people beating the
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.040]  commandos on the head with poles and it does at least at those points look like
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.240]  the Israelis are being restrained while they're being attacked with poles I
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:03.080]  agree it's wrong to attack the ships it I mean it's wrong to take them over it's
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:08.240]  it's wrong to have the blockade to stop them my issue is though I think the
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.240]  Arabs lose some credibility here when their media puts out that nobody was
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.480]  attacking the commandos when their own live feeds show it clear as day okay
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.880]  well I think we're dealing with a problem with the translation because what
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.640]  the Arab media is saying Israel claimed that the people on board the aid fleets
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.920]  attacked first that the commandos just set foot on the deck and they weren't
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.040]  doing anything bad and then the crew of the ship just attacked them now in my
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.600]  point of view they were they were justified in attacking the invading
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.640]  force at that point anyway what the Arab media is saying is that it wasn't
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:46.280]  until the Israelis started firing first that's when the sticks and poles and
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.760]  knives got picked up and the melee basically stay there we got a break
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.320]  let's come back and cover all that on the other side with Mike Rivera stay

[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:16.640]  well Mike brings up the central point that I've made several times in the
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.800]  first hour and watching that one live feed that got out that's been on Al Jazeera
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:28.360]  press TV Fox CNN and hundreds of you know different local TV stations scores of
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:32.000]  international networks and we're going to continue to roll that in the
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.520]  background in fact I'll probably just just play one of the reports you know
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.360]  unedited coming up because we've got some Eclipse here that are from start to
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:46.640]  finish with the press TV reporters and others out on the deck and you do hear
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:52.360]  banging and exploding in the minutes and seconds before the boarding and and
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:58.080]  that actually fits with how ships are normally boarded during a blockade they
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.160]  fire tear gas they fire flash bangs they fire across the bow the ship won't
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:10.280]  stop then the ship finally gets scared it runs the flag up and the Arabs and
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.440]  the pro-Palestinian group they say yeah we ran the white flag up then the Israeli
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.600]  commandos come down because the ship has surrendered and then the people attack
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:26.160]  them so there's no doubt that that the Israelis attack the ship with flash
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:34.280]  bangs and with tear gas the but the big issue is and the problem is Israel has
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:40.320]  the ship now and ships and can cover this up if Israel fired real ammunition
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:44.800]  to the ship there is no doubt this was illegal micro vera well you need to
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.560]  remember that what Israel calls a rubber bullet is not what the United States
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.800]  calls a rubber bullet the Israeli rubber bullets still have steel cores and they
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:59.260]  are lethal at close distance and the bottom line here is again Israel can
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.800]  make up any statements it wants about why it wants to stop the aid fleet but
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:09.040]  they have never ever once found any evidence of weapons going into Gaza the
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.600]  ship was carrying construction supplies to repair the damage from cast lead was
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:17.760]  carrying food medical supplies crayons toys for the kids all of these ships
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.760]  cargoes were inspected at their ports of departure Israel is basically throwing a
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.080]  tantrum and saying you have to do what we tell you to do anywhere in the world
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.680]  and you need to remember Israel doesn't have the legal authority to issue
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:36.600]  orders to ships flying foreign flags in international waters and again Israel is
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.480]  just you know making up these stories to justify continuing this blockade of
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.400]  Gaza to try and starve the Gaza people into leaving because Israel covets
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.000]  their land that this has been the agenda for the last four years Israel is
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.560]  putting out all this propaganda to justify what is in essence unjustifiable
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:59.240]  they're still coming out with this canard that Hamas took control of Gaza
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.640]  with a violent coup they didn't Hamas won the election but Israel doesn't want
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.600]  to admit the election happened anymore because the you know Israel believes in
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:12.080]  democracy only when their people can win and they support the Palestinian
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.560]  Authority because the Palestinian Authority is so far basically just
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.560]  rolling over and allowing the West Bank settlements to continue and allow the
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:24.440]  encroachment of more you know land grab and basically what is left of
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:28.200]  Palestine is dissolving before the eyes of the Palestinian people all of this is
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:33.760]  in defiance of United Nations resolutions and I remember back in 2003 when
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:38.760]  we were sending our young men and women to go in and attack Iraq over weapons of
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.160]  mass destruction that Israel claimed they had and they didn't have them we
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:46.440]  were being told that the reason we were doing this was because Iraq was defying
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:50.440]  the United Nations well now we have Israel defying the United Nations and
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.880]  what is the United States government do they stand up in the Security Council
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:58.320]  and say oh we can't criticize Israel for what they did and it's just it's it's
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:03.560]  it's angering to see the government of the United States of America so much
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:07.680]  supportive of the government of Israel ask this what's gonna happen when the
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:14.400]  Turks send warships in I mean is Israel gonna attack them I think Israel very
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:18.920]  well might Israel cannot admit error they cannot back down I think there's
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:22.560]  going to be a confrontation at sea and the whole region may may blow up
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.560]  because Syria and Lebanon and all these other countries are saying Israel has
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.960]  started a new regional war and now you just said it you just said it perfect
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:36.840]  timing in Asia we've got the Korea blow up between north and south with the
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.640]  torpedo which is very suspicious we'll talk about that when we come back
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.880]  separately you've got the Middle East blowing up you've got Iraq you know
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.560]  setting fire again you've got escalations in Pakistan and Afghanistan
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:54.960]  right as the central banks collapse Europe and the United States right as
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.440]  the G20 is openly announcing the birth of world government magically the wars
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.400]  start Mike how many times have we talked about in last year that they're
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.200]  going to have to have wars and the Rand Corporation said two years ago that they
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.760]  need wars all over the planet to bring in the world government and that own
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.120]  only a new world war can do it and it looks like it's being delivered on a
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.920]  silver platter yes by Israel and we need to keep that in mind here because one
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.960]  of the problems we have with all of our previous wars are that the nations that
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.320]  really start them very often skip out sideways and the blame falls on a third
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:37.760]  party and we need to remember Israel is the author of this new global disaster
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:44.000]  well they let past aid ships in why did they stop this well they ride back with
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.480]  micro vero
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:55.400]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:43.940]  I looked it up yesterday and there have been
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:47.940]  no fewer than 20 aid convoys
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.940]  generally smaller ships though that Israel has openly let come in
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:56.940]  carrying medicine, toys, construction supplies
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:00.940]  things of that nature, educational supplies
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.940]  why did they decide to stop this one when it was coming out of Turkey
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.940]  and why is this coming now?
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:13.940]  and we're also going to get into a tax on free speech here in the United States
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.940]  and as I said, take some of your phone calls

[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:31.940]  before we go back to Mike Rivera, we're carrying a new film that is very important
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:36.940]  if the population is not educated about our true form of government
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:39.940]  and about the fact that it's our right and our duty under the 9th and 10th Amendment
[01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:42.940]  to take back our government
[01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:46.940]  then we have no hope of ever reversing the globalist takeover
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:52.940]  it's a private, offshore, corporate takeover of the United States simply put
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.940]  and the film by Gary Franchi and William Lewis don't tread on me
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.940]  Rise of the Republic has Michael Bagnaric
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:04.940]  RJ Harris, myself, Evan Vieira, Richard Mack, Cynthia Davis, Charles Key
[01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:09.940]  and many, many others and it's so important that everyone see this film
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:14.940]  it's one thing to know we have a corrupt out of control government
[01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:18.940]  it's another thing to know how to take it back and this is a big part of the solution
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:23.940]  what kind of government did the founding fathers intend for us
[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:25.940]  when they struggled to form this nation?
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:28.940]  did they seek another form of suppressive rule?
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:31.940]  did they envision an enslaved population with few liberties?
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:36.940]  don't tread on me gives the viewer a look into the minds of our forefathers
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:42.940]  the legislation written to protect each and every one of us from a tyrannical government
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:46.940]  don't tread on me discusses the government's overuse of the Commerce Clause
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:51.940]  the suppressed and ignored states rights issue
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:57.940]  don't tread on me discusses the government's overuse of Commerce Clause
[01:35:57.940 --> 01:36:02.940]  the suppressed and ignored states rights issue defines sovereignty
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:06.940]  the proper role of government, a constitutional militia and much more
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:11.940]  don't tread on me offer sound solutions to take back rights stolen
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:15.940]  from our out of control despotic federal government
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:22.940]  from our out of control despotic federal government
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.940]  rights stolen from the American people by our out of control despotic federal government
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:31.940]  it is such an important film to see again don't tread on me rise of the republic
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.940]  and of course there's a new film we produce Jason Mermas directed
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:37.940]  Invisible Empire New Order Defined

[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.940]  how they operate the crimes they've committed
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:46.940]  over a hundred clubs of them calling for world government, new world order
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.940]  somebody that wants a general overview of these people
[01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:51.940]  and who's been living in denial a very important film for people to see
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:55.940]  again available at infowars.com

[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:23.940]  going back to you
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:28.940]  you were bringing up the fact that Israel is starting this World War 3
[01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:31.940]  or potentially as separately
[01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:36.940]  what do you see happening on the Korean Peninsula
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:39.940]  I know you've written about that at whatreallyhappen.com
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:41.940]  and we have quite a few reports
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.940]  even with the Chinese government and others saying this could be a provocation
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:48.940]  it looks to be a German torpedo
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.940]  not a Chinese torpedo that we know the North has
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:58.940]  Kibono who benefits why would the North stage something like this
[01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:01.940]  we see Japan wanting US forces out
[01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:05.940]  now backing away from that as soon as this happened
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:09.940]  well basically I think we can all agree that you know
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:13.940]  even though Kim Jong-il sometimes issues some very questionable statements
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:16.940]  and his taste in sunglasses is definitely the question
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:19.940]  but I don't think Korea is stupid enough to do something like this
[01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:22.940]  and if you look at exactly where this sinking took place
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.940]  where it's deep inside South Korean waters
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:29.940]  inside the middle of an ongoing military exercise involving three
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:33.940]  top of the line US warships, guided missile destroyers
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.940]  by Kondorogas and Arleigh Birx and they are very well equipped
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:38.940]  for anti-submarine warfare
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:42.940]  so the idea that one of those clunky, noisy North Korean submarines
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.940]  could scoot across the demarcation line
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:48.940]  get into the middle of this ongoing exercise
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:51.940]  flip off a torpedo at this warship and then get out
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:54.940]  without being detected is absolutely ludicrous
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:57.940]  now when they were holding up the blueprints of the North Korean torpedo
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:00.940]  that they claimed that they had found the remains of
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:03.940]  when you study it very carefully and you look at the torpedo itself
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:06.940]  and the blueprints they're not the same weapon
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:09.940]  because of the location of the fin actuators within the structure
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:11.940]  there's a bunch of other differences as well
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:14.940]  but I am absolutely convinced that what they found on the floor of the ocean
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.940]  is not that North Korean torpedo design
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.940]  as you point out the metallurgy suggests it's one of the German torpedoes
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:24.940]  well who's got German subs and is running around trying to start wars
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.940]  Israel in fact three of their German built dolphin submarines
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:30.940]  now sailing off the coast of Iran
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:34.940]  they're openly acknowledged to be carrying nuclear-tipped cruise missiles
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:37.940]  we know that they're operating all the way out to the Pacific
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.940]  and Israel likes to start wars
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:44.940]  and so what better way than to go out and flip off a torpedo
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:48.940]  sink this North Korean warship in the US and Israel and everybody else's
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:53.940]  oh I'm sorry sink the South Korean warship and blame it on North Korea
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.940]  it's like the USS Maine all over again or the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:59.940]  and now China and Russia are both backing off and saying
[01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:02.940]  they're not convinced that North Korea had anything to do with this
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.940]  they're very suspicious that this is another classic
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:07.940]  well I mean Mike look
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:10.940]  I mean I can see this being a German torpedo
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:15.940]  and I can see the West wanting to stay on the Korean peninsula
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.940]  as part of the encirclement of China
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:21.940]  and that's part of the stated Pentagon doctrine
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.940]  but Israel in a medium range submarine
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:28.940]  and we know they do buy these German torpedoes
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:31.940]  but I don't think that's enough evidence
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.940]  but I mean you can correct me if I'm wrong
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.940]  to point at Israel
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.940]  I mean I don't think Israel is the progenitor
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:42.940]  and the source of every form of evil on earth
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:48.940]  no but I mean we just saw them open fire on a harmless egg convoy over the weekend
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:52.940]  and killed apparently the death counts now up to 20 people
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:55.940]  and the bottom line is if you go back and look at the USS Liberty
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:59.940]  they attacked that ship with the goal of tricking the United States into war on Egypt
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.940]  look at the Levan affair the same thing
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:05.940]  Israeli agents were caught blowing up British and American targets in Egypt
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:09.940]  again to destroy diplomatic relations between the West and Egypt
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.940]  to try and trip up another war
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:14.940]  USS Cole may have been in more of the same situation
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:17.940]  I mean the bottom line is look at the model of the Mossad
[01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:20.940]  by way of deception thou shalt do war
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:25.940]  and again you know we already know that those Israeli submarines have been operating in the West Pacific
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:29.940]  because they had an incident a few years ago where they accidentally rammed a Japanese ship
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:32.940]  and tried to evade responsibility for that
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:36.940]  and then they were forced to turn around and admit that yeah that was us and we're sorry and everything
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:42.940]  again Israel itself is such a small nation they project power through covert means
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:44.940]  and we don't know who was out there
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.940]  but I'm basically saying we shouldn't leak to conclusions
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:51.940]  and believe the first thing the corporate media tells us about the North Korean situation
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.940]  again North Korea doesn't want a restart of the Korean war
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.940]  No listen Mike I hear you
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:03.940]  and I mean it is starting to point towards false flag over in the Pacific
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:07.940]  you know they're south of China on the Korean Peninsula
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:11.940]  and you're right I mean Israel admits to the Levan affair
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:15.940]  the NSA declassified two years ago Chicago Tribune
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:18.940]  that all the admirals and I literally had them all on
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:20.940]  they're almost all dead now
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.940]  you know what they said was the truth
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:27.940]  about what happened with the USS Liberty so that's confirmed
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:31.940]  it's just how would Israel stand a game
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:35.940]  starting a potential war even nuclear
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:38.940]  in the Pacific drawing the US away
[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:42.940]  so that they could then have their own war with Iran
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:46.940]  I mean I guess that's what the big banking establishment wants
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:49.940]  is they do want a big global war
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:52.940]  so through that crisis they can establish their world government
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:57.940]  we know Israel's part and parcel of that so is the US and the EU
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:03.940]  it's just that even from my research it's hard to believe they're all working in concert that closely
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:06.940]  but I mean I guess that's where the evidence points
[01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:09.940]  but clearly there's elements of our own Navy SEALs
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.940]  I mean we know it came out in the New Yorker magazine on MSNBC
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:20.940]  that Sy Hersh reported that Cheney wanted to have US troops attack US ships
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:23.940]  to blame it on Iran three years ago three and a half years ago
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:29.940]  so my only issue is there are other suspects that do stage some terror
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:33.940]  I mean is there any evidence Israel was involved in the Gulf of Tonkin?
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:39.940]  Well absolutely not the Gulf of Tonkin began with an inexperienced sonar operator
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:41.940]  hearing his own ship's propellers
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:44.940]  and Johnson knew that it was an erroneous report when he went to Congress with it
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:47.940]  but to getting back to the Korean situation first of all
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:51.940]  even though we're suggesting that Israel might have been involved there
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:54.940]  I'm not saying that they were acting unilaterally or alone
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:58.940]  we know that the US and Israeli intelligence services team up together
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.940]  on some of these various operations
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:04.940]  now if North Korea and South Korea restart their war
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:07.940]  and that starts dragging resources in from China and Russia
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:12.940]  that is going to take some of the potential for support on Iran's side away
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.940]  when the Iran war cranks up
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.940]  remember the biggest fear right now is that if Israel launches a war with Iran
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.940]  and the US gets dragged into it
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:23.940]  that Russia and China will at least logistically be supporting Iran
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:27.940]  but if they're tied up in a new war over in the Korean Peninsula
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:30.940]  that is less support they're going to be able to send to Iran
[01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:33.940]  and it's always been that logistical support
[01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:36.940]  that has been what is preventing war with Iran
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:38.940]  that's why they're trying to keep Afghanistan torn up
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.940]  that's why they're trying to get Georgia into a whole new war
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.940]  to close those tunnels through the Caucasus mountains
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:48.940]  is to prevent the resupply of Iran from Russia
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:52.940]  Well you make some really good points and time will tell
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:56.940]  but regardless we know that the power structure has stated
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.940]  that they want more than just a regional war bigger than Iraq
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:04.940]  as a global distraction to bring in this global banking dictatorship
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:08.940]  and so I find it very suspect that all of this
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:12.940]  all these different kickoffs for more regional tension
[01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:17.940]  and nuclear war is just suddenly sprouting up and popping up everywhere
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:22.940]  and you're right if Russia and China are drawn off with a situation
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:26.940]  on the Korean Peninsula that makes it a lot easier for Israel
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:29.940]  who is openly saying, I mean for those that just tuned in
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:32.940]  the last month Netanyahu has said three or four times
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.940]  we may go ahead and nuke Iran at any time
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:39.940]  they're trying to pass sanctions to blockade all trade into Iran
[01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:42.940]  which is an act of war according to the Geneva Convention
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.940]  and Ron Paul's on record with that
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:48.940]  so there's no doubt that things are just going to get a lot more hairy
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:54.940]  what are you worried about next Mike? What shoe are you looking for to drop next?
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:58.940]  Well as you point out we have got way too many of the world leaders
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:00.940]  and world financial leaders and world political leaders
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:04.940]  who see their own personal fortunes being improved by a new major war
[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:07.940]  I think back about this wonderful movie called The International
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:11.940]  and the storyline is basically that this large international bank
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:16.940]  is caught engaging in weapons trafficking, covert weapons trafficking
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:19.940]  and the investigators says to the bank, why do you care if
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:22.940]  thus in such a country wins their war and the bank says
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:26.940]  oh we don't care if they win it, it's just war creates debt on both sides
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:29.940]  so we're going to start wars because it's good for our banking business
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.940]  and we don't care which side wins or loses because both sides go into debt
[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:35.940]  and if you look back at our own history in the United States
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:39.940]  the US government got out of the crash of 1907 by getting us into World War I
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:42.940]  they got out of the crash of 1929 by getting us into World War II
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.940]  here we are in the throes of the crash of 2007
[01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:49.940]  and look how hard our government is trying to start wars with anybody at all
[01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:51.940]  it almost doesn't even matter
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:54.940]  I'm almost reminded of Michael Moore's wonderful film Canadian Bacon
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:57.940]  where America declares war on Canada just because they need a war
[01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:00.940]  and they can't find anybody else to fight with
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:08.940]  well that's another great point you've made and we now have open discussions
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:13.940]  of attacks on Iran which is just completely illegal
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:15.940]  and going back to last week Mike
[01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:20.940]  Iran says we'll give our uranium to foreign countries
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:24.940]  like Brazil or France or Turkey you pick
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:28.940]  and that way it'll be enriched to a level that can't be used in weapons
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:31.940]  and then the stance gets even more anti-Iran
[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:35.940]  I mean Iran at many levels really has tried to taunt
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.940]  Have you heard about the Lulu letter?
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:41.940]  Yes but tell folks about it
[01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:46.940]  Okay well basically in a nutshell this is a letter that was leaked out
[01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:50.940]  and exposed the fact that the United States knew that Turkey and Brazil
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:53.940]  were negotiating with Iran over a uranium swap
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.940]  but that the United States gave its approval for the negotiations
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.940]  in the expectation that it would fail
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.940]  and then they would have one more thing to use to say
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:05.940]  we need to go to war with Iran because look Brazil
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:08.940]  and Turkey tried to talk to Iran and Iran wouldn't listen
[01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:12.940]  and Iran surprised them by saying yeah this is a deal we can live with
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:14.940]  and so now the U.S. is in a panic
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.940]  they're trying to find some way to derail the situation
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:18.940]  Hillary's out there screaming about sanctions
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.940]  it's too little it's too late
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.940]  because it's not about the sanctions
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:24.940]  it's not about the uranium it's not about nuclear weapons
[01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:26.940]  it is about selling the American people
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:31.940]  yet another war on Israel's enemies in the mid-east
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:33.940]  we've got suckered into Iraq
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.940]  we're being suckered into Iran
[01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.940]  they're trying to go into Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:43.940]  everywhere, have we invaded enough countries yet to qualify as a world war?
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:46.940]  Well have you seen the
[01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.940]  well yes I mean if these conflicts stay ignited
[01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:52.940]  it will be a world war by every definition
[01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:55.940]  it's going to be in more than two regions simultaneously
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.940]  but going back
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:49:00.940]  have you seen the new video out today it's up on presentplanet.com
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:03.940]  of Oliver Stone interviewing the former
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:06.940]  Argentine president who said he met with Bush
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.940]  and Bush said we must have more wars
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:11.940]  everyone must be taught to kneel before us
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:13.940]  this is great for our economy
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.940]  but yeah great for the bankers economy
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:19.940]  they're all making record bonuses while we go bankrupt
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.940]  Yeah it absolutely is
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:24.940]  I mean if you look at the reality of how much of our gross national product
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.940]  is put into building things that kill people
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:30.940]  and you'll realize that the United States is not a nation of peace
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.940]  it's not a nation of war
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:36.940]  murder and mass murder and killing is the business of the United States
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:39.940]  and it has been all the more so over the last 30 years
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:42.940]  where our manufacturing of the items of peace
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.940]  has basically been given away to other countries
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:48.940]  and the only thing the United States seems to manufacture anymore
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:51.940]  is trouble and death on a large scale
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:54.940]  Well people need to understand that
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:57.940]  the globalists at the top are apolitical
[01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:00.940]  they're playing groups off against each other
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:03.940]  and the world population has such an elementary understanding of this
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:06.940]  that it makes them just fair game
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:09.940]  like legless chickens being eaten by foxes
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.940]  but Zbigniew Brzezinski said two weeks ago
[01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:15.940]  that for the first time the world has awoken
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:17.940]  to the true power structure
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.940]  we're not distracted by presidents and prime ministers anymore
[01:50:20.940 --> 01:50:22.940]  that come and go
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:24.940]  we're now looking at the real power structure
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.940]  it's a real problem
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:30.940]  did you see that video?
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.940]  yes I did and I also read about the comment that Zbigniew Brzezinski did
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.940]  he's absolutely kind of
[01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:36.940]  Well I'll tell you what Mike
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:39.940]  your audio's cutting out there a bit
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:42.940]  let's come back and get your take on that on the other side
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:44.940]  I'm going to keep you for one more segment after that
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:47.940]  so we can talk to Ted, Eddie, Joseph, Keith, Jimmy and others
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.940]  and we'll continue with your calls into the next hour
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.940]  with a bunch of other important news
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:58.580]  tragic events in the Mediterranean with the boarding of these aid vessels.
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:02.660]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:06.580]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know
[01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:10.420]  that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.820]  gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:17.580]  country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:22.020]  Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:27.060]  call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:30.780]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:34.860]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant
[01:51:34.860 --> 01:51:39.620]  a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:54.500]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:58.620]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:06.340]  proof of the effectiveness of how heart and body extract supports good
[01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:11.300]  circulation and healthy arterial flow. My name is Crystal. I'm a 45 year old and
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:15.780]  live in Houston, Texas. I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:20.220]  years ago. My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could
[01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:25.300]  offer me. What did Crystal do? I ordered heart and body extract in August 2006.
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:30.100]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:33.580]  the goodness of the formula starting to work. Clean, clear arteries are happy
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:38.140]  arteries after using heart and body extract. Learn more at HBExtract.com or

[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:06.300]  Alright, let's go to some of your phone calls here. Let's talk to Ted in Texas.
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:11.980]  Ted, you're on the air with Mike Rivera. Go ahead. Hello, Mike and Alex. Are we
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:14.980]  specifically talking about the events in the Middle East? You can talk about
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:19.420]  whatever you want. Go ahead. Okay, I've been working on this story. It's a local
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:25.100]  story for Austin. Basically, the headline is Austin welcomes Formula One,
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:30.780]  ignores own climate protection plan. Oh, yeah, they want citizens to pay $25
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:35.180]  million for this stupid racetrack that'll lose money, but it'll align the
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:39.620]  pockets of local, you know, the local establishment. Look, the environmental
[01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:43.700]  movement is only about stealing property. The SOS, I'm gonna put you on hold till
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:47.220]  after Mike's gone, and then we can come back and talk about this. You know, the
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:51.580]  cover of the Chronicle is, oh, locals team up with the EPA to fight the death
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:55.740]  of the earth. The local environmental movement in Austin is about stealing
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:00.660]  farms and ranches, and they literally then build hotels on whatever they steal.
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:06.140]  They are a group of vicious criminals. Mike Rivera, a quick comment on Al Gore's
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:10.780]  wife is leaving him after 40 years. Do you think it's because he's been so
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:15.380]  politically destroyed by climate gate? I don't know. Maybe it was just a fit of
[01:55:15.380 --> 01:55:22.260]  good taste. Or maybe he's picking up too many pickup basketball games with
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:27.580]  Obama. It could very well be. You know, reportedly what's going on at those. Let's
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:32.500]  talk to Eddie in New Hampshire. Eddie, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex.
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:37.220]  Hi, Mike. You already covered much of what my question was to be about, but I
[01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:42.900]  just wanted to know why provoke Turkey? Why in the world would they want to provoke
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:46.380]  Turkey, a country that's just on the sidelines? Is it to what celebrate the
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:53.660]  process? That's a good question. No. I mean, this is bold. Israel openly, Turkey
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:57.820]  saying this could cause war, and they're going to send ships in. And then if
[01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:01.380]  Israel attacks those Turkish ships, how are they going to spend that? Mike
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:05.540]  Rivera. Well, a couple of things to keep in mind, even though Turkey is nominally
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:11.140]  an Israeli ally about a year ago, the Mossad was caught as part of a plot to
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:16.500]  assassinate Erdogan, Turkey's leader, and a little piece of irony that people have
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:22.540]  not picked up on too much yet. As of this morning, the chairmanship of the United
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:27.020]  Nations Security Council has passed to Turkey. So now Turkey gets to set the
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:31.600]  agenda in the Security Council, and I think payback is not going to be very
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:36.100]  pleasant for Israel at this point. I don't know what Israel was thinking. I
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:42.220]  think that they had this idea that absent the live video feed that got out
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:45.260]  from the fleet, that they were probably going to stage something to make it look
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:51.220]  like the Free Gaza Movement really was running weapons into Hamas or
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:54.940]  something that would silence world criticism, but they didn't get to pull
[01:56:54.940 --> 01:56:59.940]  that part of it off. And, you know, certainly right now Israel is not
[01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:03.660]  allowing the media to talk to any of the prisoners taken from the ship. They're
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:07.980]  only being allowed very, very brief connections. Well, I'll say this. You're
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:10.860]  going to see more and more, and police departments are actually buying these,
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:15.660]  jamming of broadband when they run an operation, because the power that you
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:20.460]  can have an iPhone and have it streamed a remote location, and that the police
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:25.060]  can't confiscate your videotape, that is devastating corrupt governments
[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:30.020]  everywhere. I've seen three new videos today of police attacking and brutalizing
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:35.780]  camera people in the US, but they had remote feeds so the cops don't get it.
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:40.540]  So, I mean, they're still in the old game of being able to beat you up
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:44.220]  and take your video camera. That isn't working anymore. People just go to live
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:50.380]  feed. And the other thing, of course, is I think both you and I have a sponsor
[01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:53.940]  that makes the little DigiPen and DigiGlasses with the camcorders built
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:57.180]  inside. Yeah. People are trying to use those. The police don't even know they're
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:01.580]  there. And that's why they're trying to pass laws all over the country and the
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:05.140]  world, making it illegal to film government. It's going to film you. It's
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:08.940]  going to surveil you, but you don't film government, your God, your king, your
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:13.660]  Lord. Anything else you want to add, Eddie? Yeah, I just wanted to know, is there
[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:18.580]  anything that Israel can do or will do where we just won't back them up? I mean,
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:21.060]  can they, is there a line that they'll cross that the United States will just
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:24.700]  say enough? Or is it like no matter what? No, the United States says they're going
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:30.380]  to back a premeditated first strike with nuclear weapons on Tehran. And so
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.500]  you're talking at least hundreds of thousands dead. And if Iran fights back
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:38.420]  in any way, it will be called terrorism. You will be nuked. You will die and
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:46.020]  love it. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:52.740]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:56.820]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:01.220]  you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:05.580]  lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want?
[01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:10.100]  When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:14.060]  you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:17.940]  children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:22.220]  to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you
[01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:26.780]  have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and
[01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:31.340]  your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:35.540]  get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:43.820]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that
[01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:56.980]  number 1-800-409-5633. Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio...
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:08.580]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:16.100]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:22.500]  Alex Jones. Okay, I got a big news blitz coming up and more of your phone calls
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:26.060]  after Mike leaves us here in about five minutes. I got a bunch of other news I
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:31.140]  want to head on. Not just the convoy situation, but look, I wouldn't be
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:35.580]  reporting on it that much if, you know, ships are getting boarded all the time
[02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:39.980]  going into countries waters. This was international waters. I wouldn't even be
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:43.980]  covering it that much if you just had 20 people kill, which is a bad thing. But
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:49.060]  it's not as big as some of the things happening in the world. But this
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:54.580]  has the potential to lead to a full-bore war. And so you can really see world
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:59.980]  events are accelerating into a quickening right now. Let's go ahead and
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:04.220]  talk to Josh in California. You're on the air with our guest, Mike Rivera. Go
[02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:07.980]  ahead. Hey, Alex. Hey, Mike. So, listen, I want to actually ask you guys something.
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:13.740]  I received an email from a pastor of mine that actually does missionary work
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:17.940]  in Jerusalem in Gaza. And he said this out last night. He was saying, do you
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:21.180]  mind if I read a couple points real quickly from it? Go ahead. So, I'd like
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:24.860]  both your takes on it. He was saying that even after Valkata had begun, ships had
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:30.080]  routinely followed protocol and docked in Israel. Ports such as Ashtad and their
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:33.460]  cargo had been carried to land in Gaza without a problem. And he said that the
[02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:36.100]  captain of all six ships were notified they would not be allowed to break the
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:40.180]  blockade. And instead of the six ships that were boarded, only one shows to
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:44.940]  ambush the boarding IDF personnel. And then he says the ship which the
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:48.380]  conflict took place at 600 passengers on it, and eight ships usually loaded to
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:51.780]  brim of supplies. This one didn't. So, I don't know. And he's also saying that the
[02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:55.740]  attempt to break the blockade was timed perfectly for the Netnafiou and the
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:59.180]  Abbas to meet with President Obama to discuss direct talks regarding the
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:02.700]  state solution. So, I was wondering to find out what your take is on it. I know
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:07.420]  this is him coming from Jerusalem, but I'd like to find out what you guys think
[02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:14.540]  about that. Mike Rivera, comments. Well, first of all, Israel's claims that the
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:19.140]  aid would have been offloaded and taken into Gaza is a little bit weak because
[02:02:19.140 --> 02:02:23.540]  the particular supplies, construction supplies and so forth, have been blocked
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:28.060]  from Gaza by Israel for the last four years. If you remember, not too long ago
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:32.340]  Israel made a big publicity thing about they were going to allow some aid into
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:37.700]  Gaza from Egypt, but the reality was that Israel kept the food supplies on
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:41.020]  pallets in the sun for so long that by the time they were allowed through the
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:45.780]  checkpoints, they had basically rotted and were no longer usable. So, Israel
[02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:49.220]  wants to try and look good to the rest of the world. I mean, part of their
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:53.380]  propaganda is they're going around saying there are no shortages in Gaza, and
[02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:56.860]  yet we've had Senator John Kerry over there saying, yes, these people, you
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:03:01.300]  know, Israel's treating Gaza worse than the Nazis treated the Warsaw ghetto. So,
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:05.900]  Israel's claims that they would gladly ferry aid into Gaza, they haven't done it
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:11.260]  yet in any other than token situations and token volumes. And so, the reason
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:15.100]  the Free Gaza Organization continues to send these ships, and by the way, a year
[02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:19.700]  ago Israel grabbed the spirit and threw Cynthia McKinney in prison for a while. So,
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:23.540]  this has been their behavior all along. Any claims that Israel was willing to take
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:28.540]  the donated aid and get it to the people of Gaza, it generally doesn't work. What
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:32.620]  Israel will do is give it to the Palestinian Authority, who will then go
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:36.300]  out and basically do whatever they want with it, but it never reaches the people
[02:03:36.300 --> 02:03:41.340]  of Gaza. Well, you notice Gaza's run by Hamas, and Israel admits they set up Hamas
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:45.980]  as a counterbalance to Hezbollah. Just as they set up the Palestinian
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:50.180]  Authority to be a counterbalance to Hamas, it's the same game over and over
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:54.180]  and over again. Israel will put somebody into power in Gaza, and if they get too
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:58.420]  powerful, then Israel funds the opposition. When they rise to power, Israel creates
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:03.620]  a new opposition. And so, whoever they set up one day is
[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:11.140]  later a terrorist. Exactly, exactly. Well, it's the great game. It's very similar
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:15.820]  to the system the British used to maintain control of their sprawling empire.
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:22.300]  It's just that I just hope this can be diffused, but it's clear that Israel doesn't
[02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:25.940]  want it diffused because they believe they're going to win wars if they can
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:30.140]  precipitate a wider war. But I know the Lebanon experience of three years ago
[02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:38.140]  did not show that. Well, Israel thinks it will win the war if it wants to get to America.
[02:04:38.140 --> 02:04:43.500]  Mike, I'll tell you what, stay there. Your mic was cutting out again, I think,
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:48.100]  with your Skype whenever we're sending you audio of music, it cuts you out. So,
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:56.500]  let me have you finish on the other side. Okay, we'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:04:56.500 --> 02:05:00.740]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:04.660]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:08.660]  meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's
[02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:12.100]  true, seeds don't perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:16.020]  possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:20.740]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:25.740]  seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:29.020]  your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:32.900]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre
[02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:39.260]  crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com

[02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:54.140]  real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones
[02:05:54.140 --> 02:05:58.700]  for survivalseedbank.com. Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. You've heard me talk

[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:05.060]  new world order. A new world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:08.220]  is a damning indictment of the globalist through their own words and
[02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:12.540]  documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of
[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:17.060]  possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:22.260]  would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:26.340]  Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:30.660]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:34.580]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial
[02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:38.420]  system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to
[02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:42.540]  be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you.

[02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:18.700]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:24.700]  All right, we're now eight minutes into the third hour. Webster Tartley coming up in the last hour
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:29.700]  talking about the economy, the North Korea situation, the Mediterranean flakilla,
[02:08:29.700 --> 02:08:39.700]  with Israel boarding these craft. We're going to talk to Keith, Frank, Ted, Jimmy,
[02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:44.700]  Matt and others here in just a moment. But Mike, joining us from Hawaii via video Skype
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:50.700]  for folks that are watching us on prisonplanet.tv, finish up the point you were trying to make.
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:57.700]  Before I finish up that point about the game playing where Israel will set up the opposition parties
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:03.700]  in Palestine to keep the Palestinians divided and under control, we just had this story come in.
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:10.700]  CNN is now reporting that a member of the Israeli parliament who was on board that Turkish ship
[02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:16.700]  has now gone public saying that the Israeli forces opened fire on that ship five minutes
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:22.700]  before the commandos repelled down from the helicopters. So this is a member of the Israeli parliament
[02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:28.700]  saying that the Israelis started shooting first and that when they started boarding the ship,
[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:32.700]  the people on the ship fought back because they felt they were underneath attack.
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:38.700]  This is coming from a member of the Israeli parliament saying this and we just put this up at whatreallyhappen.com.
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:45.700]  Now again, getting back to the situation in Palestine, obviously Israel covets the Palestinian land
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:52.700]  and it always has. If you look at the maps of Israel ever since David Ben-Gurion declared it to be an existence,
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:57.700]  you see this constant pattern of increasing encroachment on the Palestinian lands.
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:10:04.700]  And every time the Palestinians try and form a government to basically establish their state,
[02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:10.700]  which the UN promised them, Israel will covertly fund an opposition group in order to be able to go around
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:15.700]  and say, we can't talk peace with the Palestinians. We don't know who we're supposed to talk to.
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:21.700]  It's worse than that, the Jerusalem post and herets. This is in Israel and that's the funny thing.
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:27.700]  They admit the Israeli military connects anything they don't want in the news like the denotices they have in England.
[02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:35.700]  So even in their own media, they admit that Israel since the 60s has created and funded radical Muslim groups
[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:39.700]  to destabilize a peace process.
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:48.700]  And it's even worse than that because we know that Israel has set up fake al-Qaeda terrorist cells in Palestine
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:52.700]  in order to try and tarnish the image of the Palestinians and the rest of the world.
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:56.700]  No, that was the Jerusalem post headline. Israel creates fake al-Qaeda, yeah.
[02:10:56.700 --> 02:11:01.700]  Yeah, that was it. And so it's all deception and it's all pretend and it's all make-believe and the good news is
[02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:07.700]  more and more people around the world are beginning to understand this is how these things are being done.
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:14.700]  We cannot expect truth and accuracy coming from government statements or for that matter, most of the corporate media,
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:19.700]  which is why less than 10% of Americans are now getting their political news from the TV network news
[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:24.700]  and your and my readership and viewership and listenership are continuing to skyrocket.
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:27.700]  People want the truth and they're going to go where they can get it.
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:34.700]  And the ability of the corporate media and these government propagandists to manipulate and control public opinion
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:39.700]  is very much starting to crumble before their eyes, which is, as you pointed out earlier, their passing laws.
[02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:41.700]  You've got to be licensed to be a journalist.
[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:50.700]  You've got the government is going to come in and post their messages on everybody's website to make sure their message gets out.
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:56.700]  In fact, I've got that Fox News article here in my stack and I'm going to cover it later after you leave us.
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:12:00.700]  But that's what's so amazing is the media now reports this like it's normal.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:06.700]  Like, yeah, you're not going to be able to have a blog or a website now unless the government first approves it.
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:13.700]  And even after that happens, you'll have to have government messages up on your website to counterbalance anything you say.
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.700]  I mean, this is not freedom, Mike.
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:18.700]  No, it isn't, but it is in the interest of the corporate media.
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:20.700]  They want their audience back.
[02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:28.700]  And if they can level the playing field where the blogs and alternative media are forced to parrot the same propaganda that the corporate media does,
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:34.700]  then the corporate media will lure their audience back because they've got the money for fancy sets and cute little girls in tight clothing
[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:40.700]  and all the rest of those so-called production values that they like to rely on to trick the audience into coming and looking at their content.
[02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:41.700]  Well, that's right.
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:50.700]  Mainstream media is almost unanimously from the Times magazine to the New York Times.
[02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:59.700]  They're all promoting shutting down our free speech because, of course, they were these arrogant mainstream media people that love the fact that Americans didn't have a voice.
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:04.700]  They were still arrogant and thought, oh, little websites will never rival us.
[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:07.700]  Now we're trouncing them in every poll.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:08.700]  They have no credibility.
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:10.700]  We have high credibility.
[02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:13.700]  They're losing more of their market share every day.
[02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:14.700]  They're bleeding out.
[02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:17.700]  But I want to let them know it's too late.
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:19.700]  You can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:22.700]  Your discredited whores, it's over.
[02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:24.700]  So go ahead and try to shut the web down.
[02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:27.700]  Show everybody who you really are.
[02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:31.700]  Yeah, the war with the blogs isn't just starting.
[02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:32.700]  It's already over.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:33.700]  And the blogs won.
[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:35.700]  The damage is already done.
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:40.700]  The U.S. government is dealing with a credibility crisis of mammoth proportions of its own making.
[02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:55.700]  And right now, this moment, as we watch President Barack Obama basically just stand there impotent and mute before Israel's kidnapping of American citizens from international waters, the American people are getting very, very angry.
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:14:00.700]  And they're not all that angry with Israel because Israel is basically acting true to type.
[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:09.700]  They're angry with the U.S. government for very obviously selling out the European press as saying Obama knew ahead of time that this was going to happen.
[02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:16.700]  So we have this situation of the U.S. government basically going along with a foreign government's attack on our own people.
[02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:18.700]  And most Americans see this as treason.
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:20.700]  All right, Mike, I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:27.700]  We'll see you again next month unless the economy continues to implode in the stage of new war and shut the web down,
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:30.700]  which is something under the Cybersecurity Act they're openly talking about.
[02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:33.700]  But hopefully we'll be here again next month.
[02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:34.700]  Mike, good having you on.
[02:14:34.700 --> 02:14:35.700]  We appreciate the time.
[02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:36.700]  Thank you very much.
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:38.700]  I look forward to seeing you next month.
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:39.700]  All right, take care.
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:44.700]  Well, he made a lot of really good points and made some very convincing arguments there.
[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:49.700]  I just want to add in the larger whole Israel is also being played in this.
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:57.700]  All the nations of the earth are being manipulated by this military industrial complex.
[02:14:57.700 --> 02:15:00.700]  And we do have the counterpunch article.
[02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:03.700]  We're going to get it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:13.700]  A member of Israeli Knesset says that Israeli military did begin firing on the ships five minutes before they even boarded.
[02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:25.700]  And so if that is confirmed, that is just amazing to have something like that going on.
[02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:28.700]  But right now, let's go back through these calls.
[02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:33.700]  Ted called in earlier and I put him on hold because he wanted to talk about a local issue.
[02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:44.700]  Yeah, they're bringing a $25 million a year formula one track to Austin, Texas and Austin can't support a football team, a baseball team, a basketball team.
[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:48.700]  It can barely support, you know, a minor league baseball team.
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:51.700]  And that's the city council.
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:52.700]  It's a rich city.
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:54.700]  A lot of smart people here.
[02:15:54.700 --> 02:16:01.700]  So they're stealing 2.6 billion and new energy taxes over three years, carbon taxes, new regulations.
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:08.700]  They spend 76 million on all the roads and 100 plus million on the buses that less than 1% ride.
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:12.700]  We have a criminal city, but look, you deserve it, Austin.
[02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:17.700]  And this is happening in other cities around the country because you're mad, but you won't go to city council.
[02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:19.700]  You won't go to county commissioner.
[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:22.700]  You won't speak up because your name might show up on Google.
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:24.700]  So you're going to get gang raped.
[02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:28.700]  But yeah, the evil carbon footprint of the formula one racing.
[02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:34.700]  I mean, if you want to build a chicken coop in the county outside Austin, you better bow down and worship the government.
[02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:40.700]  If you want to basically, you know, throw a stick in the air, you better get a license for it.
[02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:48.700]  But if you want to steal a farmer's ranch and then build high rises on it and you're the former mayor, I mean, literal mobster,
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:53.700]  you could pour cyanide in the creek and there'll be cops there bowing down and worshiping it.
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:56.700]  I mean, it is just a criminal group of lawless scum.
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:17:00.700]  But you want to do a comment on that, Ted.
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:01.700]  So go ahead and make your point.
[02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:03.700]  I'm going to go to Keith, Fred, Jimmy, Matt and others.
[02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:05.700]  And I do have a news blitz coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:06.700]  So I got a hurry here.
[02:17:06.700 --> 02:17:07.700]  Go ahead.
[02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:09.700]  Well, what a beautiful introduction.
[02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:11.700]  And it does go past the city level.
[02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:20.700]  It's all the way up to the state because what happened is Kirk Watson in the same session of 2009, he wrote Senate Bill 184,
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:31.700]  the greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy, and in the same session, he wrote Senate Bill 1515, which gave the funding to the racetrack.
[02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:38.700]  So I think he's the one that owns the bank and he controls through SOS, the tens of thousands of acres taken.
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:43.700]  And he literally is the Don Carlioni in three piece suits.
[02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:51.700]  And he's gotten, you know, like fat, like the penguin now, and he just struts around as if he is God and just owns everything.
[02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:54.700]  And literally, if you don't like it, paramilitary forces are on their way.
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:55.700]  Go ahead.
[02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:56.700]  You're right.
[02:17:56.700 --> 02:17:57.700]  I'm worried, Alex.
[02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.700]  I'm, you know, checking my front door.
[02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:01.700]  But I put a little article.
[02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:05.700]  It's called City of Austin welcomes F1 racing ignores climate protection plan.
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:07.700]  It's on the prison planet for him.
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:08.700]  All right.
[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:11.700]  In fact, let's have Kurt Nemo or somebody.
[02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:17.700]  Let's send that to show tips or writers and he'll read over it because I am aware of everything you just talked about.
[02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:20.700]  And that's what the climate bills are made for.
[02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:25.700]  If you're part of the inside mafia, you don't have to have any environmental standards.
[02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:36.700]  But if you're not part of their mafia, you could have something as clean as baby Jesus's diapers and you are not going to build it.
[02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:37.700]  You understand?
[02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:39.700]  You come to them for a job.
[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:41.700]  They run your life.
[02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:42.700]  And I've been there.
[02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:49.700]  I remember 10, 12, 13, 14 years ago going back, going to farmers and ranchers houses outside Austin and they'd come in and they'd say,
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:54.700]  we're not paying you but three cents on the dollar for this ranch and we're taking it with a bond proposal.
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:19:03.700]  And the city of Austin, the communists would line up and, you know, the dirty leg hippies and they would take every inch of that property.
[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:08.700]  And then as soon as they had all the land, no longer do they try to pull the hippies at city council to be the babies.
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:12.700]  No, they banned them individually from speaking selectively.
[02:19:12.700 --> 02:19:15.700]  They said, you're a trouble speaker and now it's nothing about that.
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:17.700]  And now they've moved on to their carbon taxes.
[02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:24.700]  And let me tell you, you drive out there in southwest Travis County, the tens of thousands of acres.
[02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:32.700]  It's big old five million dollar homes, luxury spas, just malls.
[02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:40.700]  And if you want it, you go to that former city council, every one of them is just a royal richie now who just owns everything.
[02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:42.700]  And I mean, it's just total lawlessness.
[02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:46.700]  Ha, ha, ha, it feels good.
[02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:48.700]  And now they're going to do it on a mass scale.
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:51.700]  You cannot describe the evil.
[02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:53.700]  But hey, you people lay there and take it.
[02:19:53.700 --> 02:19:55.700]  Well, they're going to give it out to you.
[02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:56.700]  Don't worry.
[02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:58.700]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:03.700]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:08.700]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:09.700]  It's true.
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:14.700]  Seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:19.700]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:26.700]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:30.700]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:34.700]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:37.700]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:37.700 --> 02:20:44.700]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:48.700]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:53.700]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:56.700]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:59.700]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:04.700]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:09.700]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:14.700]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:16.700]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:22.700]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:27.700]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:30.700]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:35.700]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:35.700 --> 02:21:38.700]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:42.700]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:44.700]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:46.700]  Invisible Empire.

[02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:58.700]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from ITUS Resources.
[02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:00.700]  June 1st, 2010.
[02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:02.700]  Goal opened this morning at 12.25.40.

[02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:15.700]  That's 12.5807, 6.2903 or 3.14.52.
[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:18.700]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:20.700]  Are we going to see economic growth?
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:22.700]  Slide into a recession or worse, depression.
[02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:27.700]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:31.700]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:34.700]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks.
[02:22:34.700 --> 02:22:39.700]  The book is free and can be used by calling 800-686-2237.
[02:22:39.700 --> 02:22:42.700]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000-year history.

[02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:55.700]  Karo Stove for Family Emergency Solutions.
[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:24.700]  Why is Israel doing this?
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:26.700]  Why is Israel doing this?
[02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:28.700]  I mean, I don't hate Israel.
[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:32.700]  I'm not one of these people that, it's like a religion of disliking Israel.
[02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:38.700]  I mean, I found a lot of the people that hate Israel themselves are a bunch of nuts and make stuff up about people.
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:42.700]  I've experienced it just because I'm not a frothing, anti-Israel person.
[02:24:42.700 --> 02:24:45.700]  I criticize Israel all the time.
[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:51.700]  You know, these people will get really mad at me and like make up lies about me and say things that aren't true.
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:55.700]  So that makes the anti-Israel crew lose credibility in my mind.
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:25:01.700]  But still, I mean, it's just Israel continues to do all these bad things and we're going to report on it here.
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:10.700]  You know, I understand they feel like they're surrounded and they hate their neighbors and everything and their neighbors hate them, but this is not going to go over well.
[02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:15.700]  Look, I want to continue with Keith, Frank, Jimmy, Matt, Ken and others.
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:19.700]  And then I do have four giant stacks of incredibly important news.
[02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:21.700]  We're going to go over.
[02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:23.700]  Let's go to Keith in Texas.
[02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:25.700]  Keith are on the air.
[02:25:25.700 --> 02:25:26.700]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:33.700]  I was able to get on the Sean Hannity show and plug invisible empire successfully and get him to talk about it a little bit.
[02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:36.700]  Good job, master five channel.
[02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:37.700]  Thank you.
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:42.700]  It's up there ready for people to see it if they check out Funkmaster five all spelled out.
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:46.700]  Press that yellow subscribe button and it's there.
[02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:49.700]  What did what did Hannity say?
[02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:58.700]  Well, he let me talk about it a little bit, which surprised me because the last time I called him, he just hung up on me as quick as he could.
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:04.700]  And he ended up saying that he doesn't believe the bankers are in control.
[02:26:04.700 --> 02:26:07.700]  No, yeah, they're good.
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:08.700]  Yeah, of course.
[02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:12.700]  And you know, there's a world government because he's done his job good.
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:17.700]  The last decade telling conservatives there's no such thing as a new world order.
[02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:26.700]  Well, you know, the last time I talked to him about Bilderberg group, he equated it to a mother's mother's spaceship flying around the earth.
[02:26:26.700 --> 02:26:28.700]  You know, but he's going to have a problem.
[02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:31.700]  His little commander, Glenn Beck, does talk about it.
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:36.700]  I mean, Bilderberg's admitted now, so they've got some eggy on their faces.
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:44.700]  Well, yeah, you know, and and they're both losing ratings and losing listeners at a speeding rate.
[02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:47.700]  So I mean, I've seen the statistics.
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:50.700]  Hannity and Beck are in free fall.
[02:26:50.700 --> 02:26:54.700]  And of course, we're exploding and everybody else who tells the truth is exploding.
[02:26:54.700 --> 02:27:03.700]  And that's because people aren't just mad at incumbent Democrats or incumbent Republicans as every election the last year has shown.
[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:10.700]  They're mad at establishment media and people now know that Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity are establishment now.
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:16.700]  Now, but I'm going to be honest, at least Glenn Beck isn't openly anti-second amendment.
[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:19.700]  He doesn't do much to really defend it, but at least he isn't against it.
[02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:22.700]  At least Sean Hannity isn't openly against the second amendment.
[02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:25.700]  At least Sean Hannity wants to control our borders.
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:33.700]  So I will say, you know, if I had to choose the poison I was going to drink, arsenic isn't good, but it takes a lot to kill you.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:36.700]  Cyanide will kill you immediately.
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:46.700]  And the stuff coming out of Chris Matthews mouth is cyanide, whereas Glenn Beck is only, you know, a lesser poison.
[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:50.700]  And I don't really believe in lesser of two evils for a politician.
[02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:53.700]  It's just that they do do some good.
[02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:55.700]  And so I want to give them credit for that.
[02:27:55.700 --> 02:28:02.700]  I mean, Glenn Beck is going the furthest of anybody admitting world government, admitting global governance, admitting all this.
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:06.700]  And they're going to be forced to go all the way or they're not going to have any viewers.
[02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:08.700]  I appreciate your call, Keith. Good job.
[02:28:08.700 --> 02:28:11.700]  Frank in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:13.700]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:32.700]  Yeah, I wanted to say this, that this really is incredibly stupid of Israel to attack the Turkish vessel 90 miles in the Mediterranean off the coast of Israel in international waters.
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:34.700]  It's an act of war under international law.
[02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:35.700]  It's aggression.
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:37.700]  It's also piracy.
[02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:52.700]  And what's interesting about it is that the history of Israel, the Jewish refugees escaping from Europe on the Exodus and other ships that ran the British blockade,
[02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:59.700]  ultimately through the press and media, gave tacit support to the Zionists setting up the state of Israel.
[02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:17.700]  So for Israel to attack the Turkish flotilla providing relief, humanitarian relief to Gaza and the Palestinians is one of the most stupid media events as well as under international law.
[02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:19.700]  And it is a violation of war.
[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:22.700]  This could be an act of war from the Turkish point of view.
[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:30.700]  The Turkish, you cannot attack ships in international water that are flying on its flag.
[02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:31.700]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:45.700]  We need to break that down a little bit more when we get back, Frank, because, yeah, that's part of the thing that gave Israel its early support was that they were boldly running these blockades and people said, hey, they have a right to try to get out to safety from Hitler.
[02:29:45.700 --> 02:29:46.700]  Stay there.
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:56.700]  We're on the march, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:59.700]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:05.700]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:10.700]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:12.700]  Food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:12.700 --> 02:30:13.700]  How much do you want?
[02:30:13.700 --> 02:30:14.700]  When do you want it?
[02:30:14.700 --> 02:30:16.700]  Now or after the battle starts.
[02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:17.700]  When will you need it?
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:19.700]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:20.700]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:22.700]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:27.700]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:31.700]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:35.700]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:36.700]  How much will you need?
[02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:37.700]  We don't know.
[02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:38.700]  How much do you want?
[02:30:38.700 --> 02:30:39.700]  All you can get.
[02:30:39.700 --> 02:30:40.700]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:43.700]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:43.700 --> 02:30:51.700]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:30:51.700 --> 02:30:55.700]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:30:55.700 --> 02:31:01.700]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:31:01.700 --> 02:31:02.700]  What have we got?
[02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:04.700]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:08.700]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:12.700]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:17.700]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:21.700]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:25.700]  Somebody is going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:31:25.700 --> 02:31:26.700]  You have been warned.
[02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:27.700]  We have the facts.
[02:31:27.700 --> 02:31:28.700]  We have the constitution.
[02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:29.700]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:30.700]  We have common law.
[02:31:30.700 --> 02:31:34.700]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:35.700]  Don't tread on me.
[02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:36.700]  Rise the republic.
[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:42.700]  Terror is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:43.700]  A new tool in the info war.
[02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:44.700]  Don't tread on me.
[02:31:44.700 --> 02:32:06.700]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:14.700]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:18.700]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:31.700]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:31.700 --> 02:32:38.700]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:42.700]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:54.700]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a one to two month soap sampler.
[02:32:54.700 --> 02:32:55.700]  Thank you.
[02:32:55.700 --> 02:33:07.700]  Okay, I want to hurry through your calls because there's a bunch of news I want to get to before Webster Tarpley joins us to break down the big developments in the economy.
[02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:13.700]  What's happening on the Korean Peninsula and of course with Israel and the flotilla.
[02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:16.700]  Get his perspective always informative coming up.
[02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:24.700]  But going back to Frank in New York, Frank normally when a nation announces it's going to start stopping shipping.
[02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:26.700]  That's a big issue.
[02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:30.700]  But you've got a multi-nation flotilla, the main ship out of Turkey.
[02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:34.700]  Turkey inspected the vessels, said no weapons were on board.
[02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:51.700]  And now for those that just joined us, Turkey is all over the news saying they are already dispatching four frigates and support ships to that area of the Mediterranean off the coast of Israel to aid future convoys.
[02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:58.700]  So Turkey it appears is now looking for a confrontation with Israel.
[02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:03.700]  They have a word for it, but we have children listening a you know what match.
[02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:16.700]  And so, and I go back to the last few months as I kept saying the globalist want to start wars and look what's happening in North Korea, look what's happening in Israel, look what's happening in Pakistan.
[02:34:16.700 --> 02:34:21.700]  Look how Cheney tried to start a war with Russia two years ago.
[02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:25.700]  Clearly they're not going to be able to continue this banking takeover.
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:35.700]  That's what they really care about is looting the U.S., looting Europe, consolidating power, setting up the police state without having wars to politically distract people.
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:38.700]  Finish up your point Frank in New York.
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:49.700]  What I wanted to say is this, Israel sees the Turkish vessels so actually under international law Turkey has every right to go into the to retrieve those vessels.
[02:34:49.700 --> 02:35:00.700]  Plus normally through diplomatic back channels if you're going to see ships on the high sea with governments or their problems you actually inform the governments of this of your intentions.
[02:35:00.700 --> 02:35:01.700]  You have to do that.
[02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:16.700]  If you think back to the Lusitania, you remember that the German government put ads two weeks in advance in the American press about do not travel on this ship due to the fact that it's going into dangerous waters and all this stuff.
[02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:28.700]  But the Germans knew that the U.S. was sending weapons to Great Britain on those ships which was in violation of international law as well, being a neutral nation at that time.
[02:35:28.700 --> 02:35:31.700]  So what you have to remember is that this actually is planned.
[02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:47.700]  And what I wanted to also say that struck me on Friday was when the Wayne Manston report reported that Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel are members of the gay bathhouse club in Chicago and that they have membership cards.
[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:49.700]  And I was thinking, this is very strange.
[02:35:49.700 --> 02:35:52.700]  Why would this come out, especially Rahm Emanuel?
[02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:57.700]  And after further looking into it, apparently the Israeli press had known about this.
[02:35:57.700 --> 02:35:59.700]  And leaked it.
[02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:07.700]  And it's very interesting that all of the world press is aware of this story, but none of it's coming out in the American major media.
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:19.700]  And I found that to be very strange because you wouldn't want to destroy, in a sense, the credibility of your number one supporter, Rahm Emanuel, in the White House.
[02:36:19.700 --> 02:36:22.700]  And I thought that was one of the most bizarre things to have happened.
[02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:29.700]  But I never would have anticipated that Israel would have attacked on Monday the Peace Flotilla.
[02:36:29.700 --> 02:36:33.700]  And to me it just is, it's Meshugana, it's craziness.
[02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:42.700]  And it's time to maybe enforce the Simington Amendment because ultimately the weapons used in this were financed by the United States aid to the country.
[02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:53.700]  And the Simington Amendment prohibits any use of American aid or assistance against civilians in a war situation.
[02:36:53.700 --> 02:37:05.700]  So by enforcing the Simington Amendment that should have been enforced back in Operation Cast Lead, December of 2000, Dave in January of 2009, the aid to Israel would have been stopped.
[02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:16.700]  And that would waken up the members of the Knesset and the coalition parties to really look at the reality of the world as opposed to just this endless check.
[02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:21.700]  Frank, I hear you and those are all great points and I'm glad you brought up the Lusitania.
[02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:24.700]  I appreciate your call because I meant to start the show with that.
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:27.700]  I was thinking about that driving in.
[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:41.700]  Here you have the Germans for two weeks in New York and New Jersey and other papers running ads saying do not take passage to London or to other cities on this list of ships.
[02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:49.700]  And chief among them was the Lusitania, which was carrying armaments and soldiers.
[02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:56.700]  And that is what got the United States into World War I.
[02:37:56.700 --> 02:38:06.700]  And absolutely, you know, the Germans had been for years sinking British ships all over the Atlantic and the Mediterranean during World War I.
[02:38:06.700 --> 02:38:11.700]  Hard-fought war, a lot of it with U-boat wolfpacks.
[02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:20.700]  And it was sunk, of course, off the Irish coast and our media spun it and said, oh my gosh, the Germans did this on purpose.
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:26.700]  And wanted to kill Americans when the Germans had said, don't sail on this ship.
[02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:29.700]  So a lot of wars have started over blockades.
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:34.700]  Let's go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 60s.
[02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:38.700]  We went to the very highest death con right before launching weapons.
[02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:41.700]  It was almost World War III.
[02:38:41.700 --> 02:38:53.700]  And then in back channels, Kennedy got on the phone with Nikita Khrushchev and this has now been declassified and said, look, the Pentagon wants to kill me.
[02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:56.700]  And they want to have nuclear war with you.
[02:38:56.700 --> 02:38:58.700]  And I'm in danger of a coup.
[02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:03.700]  Our military probably has close to double the high-tech weapons you have, nukes.
[02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:05.700]  This has even been a front-line special.
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:07.700]  But I knew about it separately from front-line.
[02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:11.700]  I don't just watch front-line and believe it. I mean, this has been declassified the last decade.
[02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:21.700]  And before that even declassified Northwoods, it was in the news that he said, look, L.L. Limninser and others that I've getting ready to fire, they could overthrow me.
[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:23.700]  They want to have nuclear war with you.
[02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:27.700]  And at that time, Curtis LeMay was running around the head of the Air Force saying, nukum, nukum.
[02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:31.700]  That's why they made the movie Doctor Strange Love three years later about that.
[02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:37.700]  Well, General Jack T. Ripper, you know, playing the part of Curtis LeMay.
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:42.700]  And they really intended to have nuclear war.
[02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:45.700]  And Kennedy said, no, another reason they killed him.
[02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:48.700]  I'm not saying Kennedy was an angel or Kennedy was perfect.
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:53.700]  His brother Bobby, it turned out, in 62.
[02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:56.700]  And this was declassified by the State Department two months ago.
[02:39:56.700 --> 02:40:09.700]  They wanted to attack areas of Central and South America by blowing up, namely Honduras, by blowing up U.S. embassies and blaming it on their government.
[02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:15.700]  It was just when it came to killing Americans that Kennedy said, no, this is such a part of governments.
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:25.700]  My only issue is, I think it takes the political power away from this when you depoliticize it.
[02:40:25.700 --> 02:40:32.700]  Or de-radicalize it and just look at it objectively and coldly as a fact.
[02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:44.700]  I remember when I was on air in 1996 criticizing Communist generals from China in the Commerce Department with their own faxes and phone lines and e-mail, selling out U.S. sovereignty.
[02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:48.700]  And Treasury Secretary Ron Brown said, I'm not going to go to prison.
[02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:49.700]  I'll go public.
[02:40:49.700 --> 02:40:51.700]  And they killed him dead in a hammer.
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:56.700]  And the Pentagon coroner, the colonel, said they all had been shot in the head.
[02:40:56.700 --> 02:41:02.700]  Special forces on board the plane posing as security, killed everybody, blew the door and high load, or he load out of the aircraft.
[02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:11.700]  But seeing it in ran pieces saying, is it racist to criticize Chinese infiltration?
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:16.700]  Is it a hatred of Asians?
[02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:31.700]  If you're against healthcare, what does it have to do if you're against government-run Obamacare, government-run healthcare, what does it have to do with race?
[02:41:31.700 --> 02:41:34.700]  If you're for government-run healthcare, what does it have to do with race?
[02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:45.700]  If you're against it, they just inject it in there so everybody gets racially obsessed and looking over their shoulder and not trusting each other so the elites can divide and conquer us.
[02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:49.700]  So I don't think Chinese people are inherently bad people.
[02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:52.700]  Their government is corrupt and evil.
[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:54.700]  I've said it many times.
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:56.700]  I don't think Italians are bad people.
[02:41:56.700 --> 02:41:57.700]  They're great people.
[02:41:57.700 --> 02:41:59.700]  But they do have Italian mafia.
[02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:04.700]  And there's also Jewish mafia that's very well organized and very dangerous.
[02:42:04.700 --> 02:42:11.700]  And there's Dixie mafia and Wasp mafia that tends to team up in the last 200 years with Jewish mafia.
[02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:15.700]  And I'm against those mafias.
[02:42:15.700 --> 02:42:25.700]  But if you address something like Israel is the source of evil and Israel stages false flags and Israel does these evil things.
[02:42:25.700 --> 02:42:32.700]  And Israel invented evil and only Israel can do it.
[02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:34.700]  And I see exaggeration.
[02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:38.700]  I see magical powers being attributed to Israel.
[02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:46.700]  I know Israel's behind everything and I see people make things up about me that are just entirely untrue.
[02:42:46.700 --> 02:42:50.700]  Some of the most prominent anti-Israel people.
[02:42:50.700 --> 02:42:57.700]  And then it turns out a lot of them are actually federal agents in the case of Hal Turner and others.
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:03.700]  See, they don't want credible criticism of things that Israel does that are wrong.
[02:43:03.700 --> 02:43:10.700]  They want to make it racial or religious or bigoted so that it doesn't have a powerful effect.
[02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:13.700]  So that it isn't palatable to the general public.
[02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:15.700]  So that it isn't constructive.
[02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:18.700]  They want it to be destructive.
[02:43:18.700 --> 02:43:21.700]  And I'm not trying to be destructive here.
[02:43:21.700 --> 02:43:30.700]  I'm trying to be constructive so everyone can live in peace through knowledge and via understanding.
[02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:33.700]  But the truth is I've studied government history.
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:38.700]  The Romans staged false flag attacks.
[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:44.700]  The Babylonians staged false flag attacks.
[02:43:44.700 --> 02:43:46.700]  Israel stages false flag attacks.
[02:43:46.700 --> 02:43:48.700]  Our government does it.
[02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:49.700]  The Russians do it.
[02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:50.700]  The Zars did it.
[02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:52.700]  The Communists do it.
[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:54.700]  The CIA in Vietnam did it.
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:56.700]  It's all declassified.
[02:43:56.700 --> 02:43:58.700]  They all do it.
[02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:02.700]  Hal and people say, well, you're giving Israel cover saying they all do it.
[02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:04.700]  No, I'm not.
[02:44:04.700 --> 02:44:07.700]  It's like every mammal species.
[02:44:07.700 --> 02:44:13.700]  I hate to get gross here, but every mammal species leaves droppings.
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:22.700]  You know, it's like all butterflies come from caterpillars that then become cocoons.
[02:44:22.700 --> 02:44:27.700]  I mean, all I do is try to state the facts.
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:29.700]  And so humans do evil things.
[02:44:29.700 --> 02:44:31.700]  Humans do bad things.
[02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:33.700]  Humans do manipulative things.
[02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:37.700]  And I'm trying to teach people the tricks that are used by humans.
[02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:52.700]  I mean, I guarantee for the big popular anti-Semitic movement that's out there that's, you know, for the last three, four years is, you know, as popular as, you know, sliced bread, basically, and is pushed by a lot of different quarters out there.
[02:44:52.700 --> 02:45:01.700]  Let's say every Jew on earth was teleported to Pluto to freeze to death instantly.
[02:45:01.700 --> 02:45:04.700]  Freezes hard as a rock in less than one second.
[02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:07.700]  Absolute zero.
[02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:09.700]  Would there be evil anymore?
[02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:11.700]  Would people still beat their kids?
[02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:14.700]  Would banks still be ripping people off?
[02:45:14.700 --> 02:45:16.700]  Would there still be wars?
[02:45:16.700 --> 02:45:18.700]  You better believe there still would be.
[02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:21.700]  And, you know, it's that cop out.
[02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:27.700]  But let's say we had a global, Hitlerian anti-Semitic government.
[02:45:27.700 --> 02:45:30.700]  After they'd killed every Jew on earth, what, 18 million Jews?
[02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:33.700]  They would start claiming other people were Jews.
[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:39.700]  They would start saying, you know, that Jews were vampire bats that flapped around at night or something.
[02:45:39.700 --> 02:45:42.700]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:50.700]  Because it's a system of always blaming some other group, always blaming, you know, in Africa.
[02:45:50.700 --> 02:45:56.700]  Every other tribe tries to enslave and kill the other tribe in warfare because that tribe is evil.
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:58.700]  And that tribe is wicked.
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:00.700]  And that tribe is manipulative.
[02:46:00.700 --> 02:46:02.700]  And that tribe does bad things.
[02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:05.700]  Well, the truth is, your tribe's doing evil things.
[02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:07.700]  That tribe's doing evil things.
[02:46:07.700 --> 02:46:09.700]  We need to have a war against evil.
[02:46:09.700 --> 02:46:15.700]  We need to have a war of knowledge so that other people do not perish.
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:19.700]  If you cut government and you inform the general public about the way the world works,
[02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:25.700]  and you empower private property, and you empower strength and honor,
[02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:33.700]  you're not going to be able to have a corrupt government that is going to come to power no matter who's running it.
[02:46:33.700 --> 02:46:36.700]  No matter who is running that evil government, they're not.
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:39.700]  Look, it's because good people are doing nothing.
[02:46:39.700 --> 02:46:42.700]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:46:42.700 --> 02:46:48.700]  There was a really nice lady who was at my daughter's birthday party over the weekend.
[02:46:48.700 --> 02:46:55.700]  And I'd heard about Lakeway where she lives outside Austin and why she's in the local homeschool group.
[02:46:55.700 --> 02:47:02.700]  And this nice middle-class lady, these were all above average income is what I found with homeschoolers.
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:07.700]  And she talked about how at Lakeway they gave them forms, and we've got the forms,
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:13.700]  saying that under a red alert, your children will be taken to a FEMA facility.
[02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:18.700]  And that they have these drills where they turn the lights off and men come with masks into the rooms with guns
[02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:22.700]  and don't tell the kids to drill and the kids get really traumatized.
[02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:26.700]  And her daughter came home and said, I'm not allowed to talk to you without permission from my teacher.
[02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:30.700]  Now, I already have mainstream news articles on this in triplicate.
[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:32.700]  And I said, well, why don't you come on the air?
[02:47:32.700 --> 02:47:34.700]  And she called this morning and said, I'm scared.
[02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:36.700]  I don't want to use my real name.
[02:47:36.700 --> 02:47:37.700]  And I said, that's fine. You don't have to.
[02:47:37.700 --> 02:47:40.700]  And she called again and said, I just don't want to do it, period.
[02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:43.700]  And I said, that's fine. I understand you're scared.
[02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:49.700]  But the point is, folks, that this is why we're going to lose, okay?
[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:54.700]  Because I met this party, you know, the birthday party.
[02:47:54.700 --> 02:47:59.700]  We had it at my parents because they've got a pool, pool party.
[02:47:59.700 --> 02:48:09.700]  And there's all these nice, well-to-do, intelligent, professional families, doctors, accountants, lawyers.
[02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:12.700]  And they're all from different parts of Austin.
[02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:16.700]  And most of them hadn't even heard of my show.
[02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:18.700]  They're friends with my wife.
[02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:24.700]  And they would talk about how the kids come home crying when they use hot water saying it's killing animals.
[02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:26.700]  Or when they see a development, they start crying.
[02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:28.700]  And this was lots of mothers and fathers.
[02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:30.700]  This is why they pulled them out.
[02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:34.700]  And how they were trained to hate the Second Amendment.
[02:48:34.700 --> 02:48:36.700]  And how it was happening.
[02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:37.700]  It was every family.
[02:48:37.700 --> 02:48:38.700]  It was all the same horror stories.
[02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:48.700]  Now, I happened to have the Washington Post here from four years ago.
[02:48:48.700 --> 02:48:50.700]  No, no, this is seven years ago.
[02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:55.700]  February 2003, schools boost preparations for attack.
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:48:58.700]  Many anti-terror plans would stop parents from picking up children.
[02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:04.700]  Now, I happened to, in 98, even before Columbine, get video from Missouri.
[02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:06.700]  We put it up on the web.
[02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:12.700]  We have articles about it where they would take the kids to FEMA camps in elementary school secretly
[02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:17.700]  and not even tell the parents that this was going on.
[02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:20.700]  So it doesn't matter if I have her form here.
[02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:28.700]  And she told me, it's just to actually hear the mother would be informative.
[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:33.700]  To actually hear how they were in the first grade, her daughter was suddenly not talking to her.
[02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:35.700]  And I met her daughter, a very sweet little smart little girl.
[02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:38.700]  The teachers were telling them, we are your boss.
[02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:41.700]  You have a California school saying we are the parents.
[02:49:41.700 --> 02:49:43.700]  We now control your children.
[02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:47.700]  But I see these articles every day.
[02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:50.700]  I mean, I know why they have federal grants for this.
[02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:52.700]  Not just in public schools.
[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:55.700]  And they're almost always with elementary because the kids can't tell what's real and what isn't.
[02:49:55.700 --> 02:49:59.700]  I've had teachers on where they come in and say, Minneapolis announced,
[02:49:59.700 --> 02:50:02.700]  I'm going to kill you, have the kids and the teacher march out with their hands behind their heads.
[02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:06.700]  And the new simulated executions, not letting them know it was fake.
[02:50:06.700 --> 02:50:10.700]  This is just setting the precedent that the cops can do whatever they want.
[02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:12.700]  And they tell them, we're pro-second amendment.
[02:50:12.700 --> 02:50:13.700]  We're pro-homeschool.
[02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:20.700]  We're here to kill you in trauma-based mind control to create an aversion.
[02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:21.700]  What's an aversion?
[02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:24.700]  Let's say you got drunk once on gin.
[02:50:24.700 --> 02:50:25.700]  You smell gin.
[02:50:25.700 --> 02:50:31.700]  You don't want to drink it anymore because you got falling down drunk and threw up for two days.
[02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:35.700]  An aversion is, you know, if a woman's been raped and tortured,
[02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:38.700]  that ruins normal, healthy sex for her.
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:40.700]  See, it's an aversion.
[02:50:40.700 --> 02:50:43.700]  It's like ring a bell hits you in the head with a hammer.
[02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:47.700]  Pretty soon you ring a bell, people get scared or you act like you're going to hit them.
[02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:48.700]  They flinch.
[02:50:48.700 --> 02:50:53.700]  They're creating an artificial aversion to the Second Amendment homeschoolers.
[02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:56.700]  So I'll tell you about that when we get back for your call. Stay with us.
[02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:59.700]  Times are tough and you got to stretch that dollar.

[02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:02.700]  Tyranny is here.
[02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:06.700]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:08.700]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:11.700]  The United States is now recognized globally
[02:52:11.700 --> 02:52:14.700]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:18.700]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,

[02:52:41.700 --> 02:52:45.700]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

[02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:33.700]  is suing over a training drill and it says,
[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:36.700]  Miss Perry says in a lawsuit in Burlington County
[02:54:36.700 --> 02:54:38.700]  that she was traumatized when a gunman
[02:54:38.700 --> 02:54:41.700]  merged into her pharmacy at Hampton Behavior Health Center.
[02:54:41.700 --> 02:54:46.700]  He demanded OxyContin said he had taken a hostage.
[02:54:46.700 --> 02:54:50.700]  The gun wasn't real and the gunman worked for the company
[02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:54.700]  and it said that the insurance company funded him to do this.
[02:54:54.700 --> 02:54:58.700]  Now, they didn't tell her it was a fake robbery.
[02:54:58.700 --> 02:55:02.700]  Folks, that is hardcore trauma to have somebody come in
[02:55:02.700 --> 02:55:03.700]  and aim a gun at you.
[02:55:03.700 --> 02:55:07.700]  Now remember, this is going on with elementary students every day
[02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:09.700]  and here was the bigger issue.
[02:55:09.700 --> 02:55:11.700]  Most of the parents didn't even know.
[02:55:11.700 --> 02:55:13.700]  Oh, that was the other issue.
[02:55:13.700 --> 02:55:20.700]  The elementary school out by Lake Travis,
[02:55:20.700 --> 02:55:23.700]  they didn't tell the parents they had done it
[02:55:23.700 --> 02:55:27.700]  and the parents when the woman talked to them were like zombies.
[02:55:27.700 --> 02:55:29.700]  Imagine they turn the lights off,
[02:55:29.700 --> 02:55:31.700]  a man comes in and says he's going to kill you
[02:55:31.700 --> 02:55:32.700]  and doesn't tell you it's a drill
[02:55:32.700 --> 02:55:35.700]  and the kids are all crying, totally horrified, freaked out
[02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:37.700]  and bagged and not go back to school.
[02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:39.700]  Has nothing to do.
[02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:40.700]  Oh, they claim it's for gunmen.
[02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:42.700]  Yeah, teach the kids how to go underneath the desk
[02:55:42.700 --> 02:55:45.700]  and be killed, not get out the windows, flee
[02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:47.700]  or teachers are armed.
[02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:50.700]  No, train your kids how to be helpless.
[02:55:50.700 --> 02:55:51.700]  Learned helplessness.
[02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:53.700]  So there's a lot of different facets,
[02:55:53.700 --> 02:55:55.700]  but in these drills they also tell them I'm a gun group.
[02:55:55.700 --> 02:55:57.700]  I'm a homeschooler group.
[02:55:57.700 --> 02:55:58.700]  I don't like you.
[02:55:58.700 --> 02:55:59.700]  That's in the AP.
[02:55:59.700 --> 02:56:02.700]  They tell them I'm here from the homeschooling group.
[02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:04.700]  So the kids now when they hear homeschool
[02:56:04.700 --> 02:56:07.700]  or hear second amendment, they think of torture.
[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:08.700]  They think of pain.
[02:56:08.700 --> 02:56:11.700]  They think of a man threatening to kill him.
[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:15.700]  Now here's a new one.
[02:56:15.700 --> 02:56:20.700]  Las Vegas son hospital uses armed man and unannounced drill.
[02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:24.700]  Test of security procedures results in frightening moments.
[02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:26.700]  I'm going to cover this when we come back in the next hour
[02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:29.700]  and then a few more calls than Webster Tarpoli is joining us.
[02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:37.700]  There's a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to as well here today.
[02:56:37.700 --> 02:56:40.700]  But before I go any further, I wanted to thank a couple of the sponsors
[02:56:40.700 --> 02:56:43.700]  that have made today's radio show possible.
[02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:47.700]  Number one, my books and videos and material
[02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:50.700]  that we offer on the online video slash apparel store
[02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:51.700]  at infowars.com.
[02:56:51.700 --> 02:56:56.700]  It is your purchase of the videos that makes all of my future films
[02:56:56.700 --> 02:56:58.700]  and websites and radio show possible.
[02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:04.700]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:07.700]  So again, please visit infowars.com
[02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:09.700]  and check out the books and t-shirts and videos
[02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:11.700]  and material because number one, they wake people up.
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:14.700]  Number two, it funds our operation here
[02:57:14.700 --> 02:57:16.700]  and we couldn't do it without you.
[02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:19.700]  Also, sponsors like survivalseedbank.com
[02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:21.700]  in a real crisis, having non-hybrid seeds means having the ability
[02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:23.700]  to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food
[02:57:23.700 --> 02:57:25.700]  to feed your loved ones.
[02:57:25.700 --> 02:57:27.700]  There's a war on against hybrid seeds.
[02:57:27.700 --> 02:57:31.700]  The UN, Bill Gates and others buy up the old heirloom seed lines
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:34.700]  and shut them down while hoarding them for themselves.
[02:57:34.700 --> 02:57:36.700]  Now's the time to be planting.
[02:57:36.700 --> 02:57:39.700]  Get one survivalseedbank for yourself.
[02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:41.700]  Get another for friends and family or get another to save.
[02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:44.700]  But whatever you do, get involved in gardening today.
[02:57:44.700 --> 02:57:47.700]  Survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com
[02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:49.700]  or call and get a free information package
[02:57:49.700 --> 02:57:58.700]  or order the seeds by calling 877-327-0365-877-327-0365.
[02:57:58.700 --> 02:58:01.700]  Then of course, there's another great sponsor.
[02:58:01.700 --> 02:58:03.700]  Again, this is Alex Jones
[02:58:03.700 --> 02:58:05.700]  and if you heard of the Millionaire Patriot,
[02:58:05.700 --> 02:58:07.700]  you can get a free handgun and five days of firearms training
[02:58:07.700 --> 02:58:08.700]  waiting for you.
[02:58:08.700 --> 02:58:10.700]  You can get a five days of world-class gun training
[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:12.700]  and front-sight firearms training institute.
[02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:14.700]  Secure a 30-stage concealed weapons permit,
[02:58:14.700 --> 02:58:15.700]  all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:17.700]  Plus, if you act fast, a Millionaire Patriot
[02:58:17.700 --> 02:58:19.700]  will give you a free Springfield Armory pistol
[02:58:19.700 --> 02:58:21.700]  and the caliber of your choice.
[02:58:21.700 --> 02:58:23.700]  I believe now is the time for you and your family to be armed
[02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:26.700]  and trained at levels that exceed law-enforcement military standards
[02:58:26.700 --> 02:58:29.700]  without any boot camp or tough-guide real-instructor attitudes.
[02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:33.700]  That's front-sight.com, front-sight, like the front of your rifle.
[02:58:33.700 --> 02:58:36.700]  That's front-sight.com, stay with us, front-sight.com.
[02:58:38.700 --> 02:58:40.700]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:40.700 --> 02:59:03.700]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice
[02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:10.700]  and the survival of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[02:59:10.700 --> 02:59:13.700]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:18.700]  Act now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home.
[02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:24.700]  Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs
[02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:27.700]  and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:34.700]  Visit www.silverlungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice
[02:59:34.700 --> 02:59:37.700]  by producing your own colloidal silver right from home.
[02:59:37.700 --> 02:59:59.700]  www.silverlungs.com
[02:59:59.700 --> 03:00:08.700]  So, all over the United States and the Western world for that matter, they have paramilitary takeover drills.
[03:00:11.700 --> 03:00:15.700]  And here is another one of the Las Vegas sun today.
[03:00:15.700 --> 03:00:30.700]  Hospital uses armed man in unannounced drill. Test of security procedures results in frightening moments.
[03:00:30.700 --> 03:00:35.700]  How's this for an ill-conceived emergency preparedness drill? It's always ill-conceived.
[03:00:35.700 --> 03:00:38.700]  Like, oh, this was the first time it happened, yeah, tens of thousands.
[03:00:38.700 --> 03:00:43.700]  An off-duty cop pretending to be a terrorist stormed the hospital intensive care unit,
[03:00:43.700 --> 03:00:49.700]  brandishing a handgun, which he points at nurses while herding them down a corridor into a room.
[03:00:49.700 --> 03:00:52.700]  Folks, this is part of the handbook.
[03:00:52.700 --> 03:00:57.700]  Oh, you complained? Usually people don't. That's testing the mind control.
[03:00:57.700 --> 03:01:05.700]  Oh, this was the first time ever it was an accident, not a federal grant or anything, to teach you learned helplessness.
[03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:10.700]  There are harrowing moments, he explains, that the whole caper was a training exercise.
[03:01:10.700 --> 03:01:16.700]  The staff at St. Rose Dominican Hospital at the Sienna campus, where the incident took place Monday morning,
[03:01:16.700 --> 03:01:21.700]  found the exercise more traumatizing than intrusive, than instructive.
[03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:26.700]  Hospital employees would have been justified in fearing for their own lives.
[03:01:26.700 --> 03:01:31.700]  Well, what about shooting him? See, this is the problem, folks.
[03:01:31.700 --> 03:01:35.700]  What if somebody did an unannounced drill here?
[03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:38.700]  I mean, a man in a mask runs in here with a gun.
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:41.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to reach right here.
[03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:45.700]  I'm going to pull out a 357 magnum and I'm going to open fire.
[03:01:45.700 --> 03:01:52.700]  In fact, they've had three cases in the last decade, when they have this yearly drill,
[03:01:52.700 --> 03:02:01.700]  upwards of 100 miles outside of Fort Bragg, and they have military that tries to disarm police on duty.
[03:02:01.700 --> 03:02:04.700]  And the cops have killed them in every case.
[03:02:04.700 --> 03:02:07.700]  And the military always says, well, they thought the cops were part of the drill.
[03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:09.700]  This is lunacy, but it's not lunacy.
[03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:10.700]  There's a method to the madness.
[03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:12.700]  It's about saying we can do whatever we want.
[03:02:12.700 --> 03:02:16.700]  Now, again, their favorite place to do it is elementary students,
[03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:18.700]  because they don't know how to talk to mommy.
[03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:24.700]  They come home and go, I drill, man with gun, and mommy goes, good, your learning guns are bad.
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:26.700]  But daddy has gun and gun case.
[03:02:26.700 --> 03:02:27.700]  Don't worry, honey.
[03:02:27.700 --> 03:02:30.700]  You'll never have to be near that gun and never get taken, honey.
[03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:33.700]  We're going to be part of the disarm culture of slaves.
[03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:34.700]  Thank you, mommy.
[03:02:34.700 --> 03:02:36.700]  Oh, it's so scary.
[03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:39.700]  This is the mind control.
[03:02:39.700 --> 03:02:42.700]  Hospital employees would have been justified in fearing for their lives.
[03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:44.700]  Well, they were fearing for their lives.
[03:02:44.700 --> 03:02:49.700]  Just last year, Henderson police shot and killed an armed hostile man in the emergency room.
[03:02:49.700 --> 03:02:53.700]  So it would make sense that security and emergency preparedness have been focused at the hospital.
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:58.700]  But in Monday's incident, which occurred in a unit that houses the hospital sick at patients,
[03:02:58.700 --> 03:03:03.700]  sick as patients, nurses, patients, and their families did not know it was a drill.
[03:03:03.700 --> 03:03:06.700]  And it goes on from there.
[03:03:06.700 --> 03:03:17.700]  So the larger issue here is that this is going on at all.
[03:03:17.700 --> 03:03:29.700]  And that's the larger point that I want to discuss that I want to talk to people about out there that are tuning in.
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:37.700]  It's that you are under conditioning, you are under mind control, you are being manipulated systematically.
[03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:43.700]  And being aware of this manipulation is half the battle.
[03:03:43.700 --> 03:03:48.700]  The other half of the battle is going into your school districts wherever you're located,
[03:03:48.700 --> 03:03:54.700]  going into your communities, and explaining, you're not going to traumatize my children.
[03:03:54.700 --> 03:03:56.700]  You're not going to manipulate them.
[03:03:56.700 --> 03:03:58.700]  You're not going to put sodium fluoride in my water.
[03:03:58.700 --> 03:04:04.700]  I have a CBS news clip that I was sent where they admit that the water has hundreds of toxic chemicals added to it,
[03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:07.700]  massively increasing cancer in major studies.
[03:04:07.700 --> 03:04:11.700]  So now they're even admitting it's poison, but they stick it in our water.
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:15.700]  It's forced medication.
[03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:21.700]  I've seen national polls where upwards of 80-plus percent of Americans don't want sodium fluoride in their water.
[03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:23.700]  Well, why do you still buy fluoride toothpaste?
[03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:24.700]  Why do you still drink it?
[03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:26.700]  Why do you still put up with it?
[03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:28.700]  Is this our country?
[03:04:28.700 --> 03:04:30.700]  Or is it the eugenicist?
[03:04:30.700 --> 03:04:32.700]  Is it the social engineers?
[03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:33.700]  Is it theirs?
[03:04:33.700 --> 03:04:37.700]  Do they get to do whatever they want, whenever they want?
[03:04:37.700 --> 03:04:42.700]  You know, that's the larger question that we have to discuss.
[03:04:42.700 --> 03:04:47.700]  I'm going to hit some more economic news, get in some other military news,
[03:04:47.700 --> 03:04:53.700]  and we're going to talk to Webster Tarpoli about Geithner telling the Chinese the U.S. is basically financially done.
[03:04:53.700 --> 03:04:56.700]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:24.700 --> 03:05:25.700]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:28.700]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[03:05:28.700 --> 03:05:31.700]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden.
[03:05:31.700 --> 03:05:34.700]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[03:05:45.700 --> 03:05:50.700]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:05:50.700 --> 03:05:53.700]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:20.700 --> 03:06:40.700]  We turned genes inside out, diamond gusset genes, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[03:06:40.700 --> 03:06:44.700]  Our Defender motorcycle genes combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,

[03:07:17.700 --> 03:07:21.700]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:23.700]  has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:07:23.700 --> 03:07:27.700]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:07:27.700 --> 03:07:32.700]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:07:32.700 --> 03:07:38.700]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:07:38.700 --> 03:07:41.700]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:07:41.700 --> 03:07:44.700]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[03:07:55.700 --> 03:08:02.700]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:02.700 --> 03:08:06.700]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:06.700 --> 03:08:13.700]  We will continue with phone calls in this fourth and final hour.
[03:08:13.700 --> 03:08:15.700]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:08:15.700 --> 03:08:21.700]  We have a columnist and of course a doctor of history, Webster Griffin Tarpoli, joining us.
[03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:25.700]  He's one of our regular guest analysts here.
[03:08:25.700 --> 03:08:30.700]  We will also get to at least Jimmy, Matt, George, Brad, Blue Dove,
[03:08:30.700 --> 03:08:37.700]  and a few others that are holding in this hour.
[03:08:37.700 --> 03:08:46.700]  But I wanted to first get into the economy with Webster, then we'll get his take on the Gaza flotilla
[03:08:46.700 --> 03:08:50.700]  and what he believes from his research is really going on there,
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:54.700]  although it may be too soon to tell, but we're getting a clearer and clearer picture on that.
[03:08:54.700 --> 03:08:59.700]  We do have members of the Israeli Knesset coming out and that's up on prisonplanet.com
[03:08:59.700 --> 03:09:01.700]  and infowars.com.
[03:09:01.700 --> 03:09:05.700]  Key article by Steve Watson, Israel Knesset member.
[03:09:05.700 --> 03:09:10.700]  Israel wanted high number of fatalities that was said in the Knesset.
[03:09:10.700 --> 03:09:15.700]  The same member is saying that five minutes before the boarding of the main ship,
[03:09:15.700 --> 03:09:21.700]  a converted cruise ship under a Turkish flag that the Israelis were firing,
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:26.700]  not just tear gas and rubber bullets and flash bangs, but actual lead rounds.
[03:09:26.700 --> 03:09:29.700]  So that is coming up.
[03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:34.700]  And we will also, with Webster Tarpley, get into the North Korean peninsula.
[03:09:34.700 --> 03:09:41.700]  Wayne Madsen and many others who I respect believe that it's a German torpedo from the blueprints
[03:09:41.700 --> 03:09:46.700]  compared to the guts of the torpedo that survived some of the remnants.
[03:09:46.700 --> 03:09:53.700]  And this is a false flag focused at Japan who's trying to kick U.S. forces out right now.
[03:09:53.700 --> 03:09:57.700]  But all of the analysts, whether it's Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts or Gerald Salente,
[03:09:57.700 --> 03:10:03.700]  or myself, or Webster Tarpley, all of our experts and the Rand Corporation's own statements
[03:10:03.700 --> 03:10:11.700]  two years ago stated to get their world government, to have the banking cartel be able to successfully
[03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:16.700]  submit their power and get away with the robberies they've committed during this global meltdown.
[03:10:16.700 --> 03:10:21.700]  They're going to need a new war as the political smoke screens of the public get scared
[03:10:21.700 --> 03:10:28.700]  and rallies around the flag, which the bankers will wrap themselves in like a enchilada or something.
[03:10:28.700 --> 03:10:31.700]  So we're going to discuss that with Webster as well.
[03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:34.700]  But here's some of the financial headlines.
[03:10:34.700 --> 03:10:41.700]  Euro to go under $1.20, almost certainly lowest in four years.
[03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:45.700]  Volatility to dominate stock markets in June.
[03:10:45.700 --> 03:10:50.700]  Spain loses its AAA rating, meaning they'll have to pay more to the private bankers
[03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:54.700]  for their already out of control debts.
[03:10:54.700 --> 03:10:56.700]  California talking about losing its rating.
[03:10:56.700 --> 03:10:58.700]  Many counties already have.
[03:10:58.700 --> 03:11:03.700]  The U.S. moody saying pretty much certain will lose its AAA rating.
[03:11:03.700 --> 03:11:07.700]  You've just got every economic number coming in.
[03:11:07.700 --> 03:11:08.700]  Here's another one.
[03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:12.700]  Poll finds debt dogged Americans are stressed out.
[03:11:12.700 --> 03:11:15.700]  The economy trudges ahead.
[03:11:15.700 --> 03:11:21.700]  Yet debt dogged many Americans stressing them out, even as they firm up their own financial foundations.
[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:23.700]  So you've got the spin there.
[03:11:23.700 --> 03:11:25.700]  Real unemployment upwards of 23%.
[03:11:25.700 --> 03:11:27.700]  They claim 9.8.
[03:11:27.700 --> 03:11:35.700]  All, I mean, all the economic numbers and you're out there in the real world, folks, you see them show that things are just a terror rating.
[03:11:35.700 --> 03:11:37.700]  And then we're in a depression.
[03:11:37.700 --> 03:11:50.700]  Well, the media keeps saying, no, this is a recovery because the big central banks and JP Morgan chasing Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, the zombie banks, they're all making record profits.
[03:11:50.700 --> 03:11:53.700]  So the whole world is gauged by how they're doing.
[03:11:53.700 --> 03:11:59.700]  So let's let's get into that first because I saw Tarpley on international television over the weekend.
[03:11:59.700 --> 03:12:12.700]  We had it up on info wars.com and prison planet.com and I saw the news anchor report that Tim Geithner has announced that China has to find a new trading partner because the U.S.
[03:12:12.700 --> 03:12:17.700]  Public and private debt is so maxed out that U.S. citizens won't be a market for them in the future.
[03:12:17.700 --> 03:12:20.700]  I mean, that's like saying we're dead on arrival.
[03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:26.700]  Now, even if that was true, which globalization and NAFTA and GATT has caused by design.
[03:12:26.700 --> 03:12:29.700]  I mean, this was always the plan.
[03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:42.700]  Why announce it and say you better have Europe as your trading partner when they're even according to the numbers I've seen in the same or greater debt on a nation by nation basis.
[03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:45.700]  It varies, but overall about the same level as the United States.
[03:12:45.700 --> 03:12:47.700]  So why is Geithner running around?
[03:12:47.700 --> 03:13:00.700]  Well, I sure enough did a lot of searching and found a video clip of it and a French news agency report where he was quoted as saying U.S. consumers are going to be less a source of demand in the world in the future.
[03:13:00.700 --> 03:13:09.700]  So this is the statement of these Malthusian individuals where where they state we want to post industrial United States.
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:17.700]  So let's talk about the state of the world economy because we've gotten almost a fatigue.
[03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:21.700]  So have I. I've just become comfortable now at a subconscious level.
[03:13:21.700 --> 03:13:22.700]  You know, humans are like that.
[03:13:22.700 --> 03:13:23.700]  We're resilient.
[03:13:23.700 --> 03:13:28.700]  If we're around bad things or around bad news, we tend to get calloused mentally to it.
[03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:30.700]  And now I'm me and my wife are resigned.
[03:13:30.700 --> 03:13:32.700]  Okay, it's going to be an ongoing depression.
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:34.700]  Things are going to get 10 times worse.
[03:13:34.700 --> 03:13:36.700]  Our children have no future.
[03:13:36.700 --> 03:13:38.700]  Everything's going to collapse.
[03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:44.700]  We're going to fly the naked body scanners where they now admit they record your genitalia and laugh at you and put it on government databases.
[03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:46.700]  They now admit that they don't care.
[03:13:46.700 --> 03:13:50.700]  You know, the government is going to raise our taxes to give it to foreign banks.
[03:13:50.700 --> 03:13:58.700]  And so we're just sitting here basting in the evil and the rest of the world has gotten to this point, but there is resistance mounting.
[03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:00.700]  So so there's my rant.
[03:14:00.700 --> 03:14:06.700]  Let's go to economist Webster Tarpley to get his breakdown on all these facets that I've thrown out.
[03:14:06.700 --> 03:14:16.700]  But A, what does it mean when Geithner, tiny Tim, comes out and announces to China, hey, America is sunk.
[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:24.700]  Well, we first of all have to recognize that Geithner has many sides to his mouth and he talks out of all of them more or less at the same time.
[03:14:24.700 --> 03:14:31.700]  We cannot approach a serious analysis of the world economy through the various lies and tricks and swindles that Geithner comes up with.
[03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:42.700]  Because on this last trip, which took him to China, then to Britain, then to Germany, he had about half a dozen or a dozen cheap parlor tricks.
[03:14:42.700 --> 03:14:45.700]  I guess we can say that he tried to pull.
[03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:51.700]  I think that the basic reality is that we're in a world economic depression of cataclysmic proportions.
[03:14:51.700 --> 03:14:53.700]  We're now in the second phase.
[03:14:53.700 --> 03:15:03.700]  This depression, from a historical point of view, is behaving very much like the depression of 1929, 1931, 1933.
[03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:08.700]  We're about a year and a half into the acute phase of the depression.
[03:15:08.700 --> 03:15:16.700]  And just like in 1931, when we had the banking crisis in Europe, the second phase of the depression is the collapse of Europe.
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:25.700]  That was true in the period between May and September of 1931, the bankruptcies of Austria, Germany, and then the Bank of England.
[03:15:25.700 --> 03:15:26.700]  The British did default.
[03:15:26.700 --> 03:15:33.700]  The British did go bankrupt, quite contrary to things that you'll see, that they haven't gone bankrupt since 1672.
[03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:34.700]  They did.
[03:15:34.700 --> 03:15:37.700]  And that was the second round of the world depression.
[03:15:37.700 --> 03:15:45.700]  That in those days led then into a banking panic here in the United States, which shut down every bank, which followed really less than half a year after that.
[03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:47.700]  So we're in the collapse of Europe phase.
[03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:51.700]  Now, it's a depression. It's a disintegration.
[03:15:51.700 --> 03:15:57.700]  This is not a market event in the sense of a business cycle or anything of the sort.
[03:15:57.700 --> 03:16:03.700]  It's an emergency of world civilization, and it has to be fought with a recovery program.
[03:16:03.700 --> 03:16:05.700]  And I know you always want to get into your recovery program.
[03:16:05.700 --> 03:16:07.700]  We'll do that before you leave, but we have a lot to cover.
[03:16:07.700 --> 03:16:09.700]  I want to go over the Webster.
[03:16:09.700 --> 03:16:12.700]  I want to go over your take, though, on what's happening currently.
[03:16:12.700 --> 03:16:17.700]  Fun. We proved this in the United States in the 1930s, so you shouldn't be resigned to a depression.
[03:16:17.700 --> 03:16:19.700]  Depressions can be fought and should be fought.
[03:16:19.700 --> 03:16:22.700]  Now, Wagner personally has been on this trip.
[03:16:22.700 --> 03:16:28.700]  Now, he was in China attempting to manage relations with China, not very effectively.
[03:16:28.700 --> 03:16:35.700]  But I think the big thing was he had to rush to Germany to try to defend this bankrupt system.
[03:16:35.700 --> 03:16:42.700]  Now, the system is based on globalization, and that means in practice hot money, then the supremacy of hot money,
[03:16:42.700 --> 03:16:49.700]  the supremacy of hot money, speculation, derivatives, gambling bets, the casino economy,
[03:16:49.700 --> 03:16:54.700]  and the destruction of productivity, deregulation, privatization.
[03:16:54.700 --> 03:17:00.700]  Yeah, the supremacy of the central banks being able to issue any amount of made-up derivatives, counterfeit money
[03:17:00.700 --> 03:17:02.700]  to buy up whatever assets they want.
[03:17:02.700 --> 03:17:10.700]  My issue specifically, though, is what was, as a parlor trick, what is the point of telling the truth
[03:17:10.700 --> 03:17:16.700]  and saying we have indebted the American people so much, they're not going to be able to buy your widgets anymore,
[03:17:16.700 --> 03:17:18.700]  and you say he failed in China.
[03:17:18.700 --> 03:17:24.700]  I mean, they did say that they're now going to move towards increasing the value of their currency.
[03:17:24.700 --> 03:17:26.700]  Is not a successful mission?
[03:17:26.700 --> 03:17:29.700]  No, because it's going to take a long, long time.
[03:17:29.700 --> 03:17:32.700]  It's going to be very gradual, and watch out what you wish for.
[03:17:32.700 --> 03:17:40.700]  The Chinese currency peg means that they have to buy dollars to support, to keep the currency peg the way they want it.
[03:17:40.700 --> 03:17:49.700]  So, ironically, the Chinese currency peg is likely to be one of the last factors supporting the dollar against a panic crash,
[03:17:49.700 --> 03:17:54.700]  and if that were completely removed, the dollar would crash down even further.
[03:17:54.700 --> 03:17:59.700]  That's what Geithner's lobbying for, because there's no industry left, or is this just all flim-flam?
[03:17:59.700 --> 03:18:02.700]  What's the real agenda then of these people?
[03:18:02.700 --> 03:18:07.700]  And in the short term, Webster, as folks want to know, looking into your crystal ball, many of our guests predicted
[03:18:07.700 --> 03:18:09.700]  Europe would collapse next in the last two years.
[03:18:09.700 --> 03:18:18.700]  It has, but we always know that there's a separate effect where it will next bring us down as well, or will it hit Asia next?
[03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:26.700]  The principal thing that is being done now is that the dollar was collapsing all during the second half of last year.
[03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:34.700]  We looked like the dollar was going to lose any residual status as a reserve currency, so not part of a long-term plan,
[03:18:34.700 --> 03:18:41.700]  but as an immediate short-term expedient, a desperate bid to save the dollar from total collapse,
[03:18:41.700 --> 03:18:48.700]  they began the attack on Europe, on Greece. It actually started with Dubai around Thanksgiving of last year.
[03:18:48.700 --> 03:18:54.700]  Once that happened, they began to lift and shift and move into this hedge fund attack on Europe,
[03:18:54.700 --> 03:18:56.700]  assisted by credit default swaps.
[03:18:56.700 --> 03:19:05.700]  So the goal was save the dollar for the coming year, and in order to do that, they had to export some of the more acute aspects of the depression
[03:19:05.700 --> 03:19:08.700]  from London and New York to get that into Frankfurt.
[03:19:08.700 --> 03:19:14.700]  And that's admitted. I mean, the Germans have come out, our own government admits that they're in their raiding.
[03:19:14.700 --> 03:19:19.700]  The private brokerage firms are in their raiding Europe causing this, and what are they doing?
[03:19:19.700 --> 03:19:23.700]  Stalling until they can start their new Iranian war?
[03:19:23.700 --> 03:19:28.700]  I don't think these people have a time horizon beyond three to six months, quite frankly.
[03:19:28.700 --> 03:19:32.700]  I think their system is out of control. They're wildly flailing in all directions.
[03:19:32.700 --> 03:19:39.700]  An image of a ruling class gone mad with no plan and no design, but just these short-term tricks.
[03:19:39.700 --> 03:19:43.700]  All right, Webster, I want to shift gears into the flotella.
[03:19:43.700 --> 03:19:47.700]  But wait, we want to do the German block, which was the main thing.
[03:19:47.700 --> 03:19:51.700]  Okay, stay there then. We'll cover the Germans now moving to block some of this.
[03:19:51.700 --> 03:19:55.700]  Then we'll get into what's happening in the Mediterranean, then North Korea.
[03:19:55.700 --> 03:19:58.700]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:19:58.700 --> 03:20:03.700]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:20:03.700 --> 03:20:08.700]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:20:08.700 --> 03:20:12.700]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[03:20:12.700 --> 03:20:15.700]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[03:20:15.700 --> 03:20:20.700]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[03:20:20.700 --> 03:20:26.700]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:20:26.700 --> 03:20:29.700]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:20:29.700 --> 03:20:33.700]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:20:33.700 --> 03:20:37.700]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[03:20:37.700 --> 03:20:41.700]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:20:41.700 --> 03:20:49.700]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the Web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:20:49.700 --> 03:20:53.700]  Again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:20:53.700 --> 03:20:59.700]  Are you prepared? Well, you need to be hardcore prepared. There is a difference.
[03:20:59.700 --> 03:21:05.700]  To be hardcore prepared, equip yourself with the latest survival gear available at tacktowngear.com.
[03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:10.700]  All tacktown gear has been field tested by Canadian and US forces, so you know it's tough.

[03:21:58.700 --> 03:22:03.700]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:22:03.700 --> 03:22:06.700]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:22:06.700 --> 03:22:11.700]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:22:11.700 --> 03:22:18.700]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:22:18.700 --> 03:22:24.700]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[03:22:24.700 --> 03:22:28.700]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[03:22:32.700 --> 03:22:38.700]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:22:38.700 --> 03:22:42.700]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:22:42.700 --> 03:22:45.700]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[03:23:13.700 --> 03:23:16.700]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[03:23:16.700 --> 03:23:20.700]  Are we going to see economic growth, slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[03:23:20.700 --> 03:23:25.700]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:23:25.700 --> 03:23:29.700]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.

[03:23:54.700 --> 03:24:11.700]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. I want to get into the larger geopolitical structure of things,
[03:24:11.700 --> 03:24:21.700]  but we know ahead of any global financial collapse, the Anglo-American powers based out of London, the United States, Europe always launch a new war.
[03:24:21.700 --> 03:24:27.700]  And all of our experts, and I've studied this as well, that's what I concur with, they're going to need a new war.
[03:24:27.700 --> 03:24:31.700]  And just notice all this stuff is suddenly popping up, very suspicious.
[03:24:31.700 --> 03:24:39.700]  But finishing up, Germany has dared declare that they're not going to fit the bill, mainly to bail out France.
[03:24:39.700 --> 03:24:44.700]  We're now learning that most of the money, they've already paid to fix supposedly the debt of Greece.
[03:24:44.700 --> 03:24:51.700]  And so German central bankers and in German newspapers are saying, where is our money going?
[03:24:51.700 --> 03:24:59.700]  Just like our Congress says, wait, you said this 800-plus billion was for the tarp, the tarp money is for the mortgages.
[03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:04.700]  Where did you spend it? And Geithner says, I'm not going to tell you.
[03:25:04.700 --> 03:25:09.700]  The head of the Fed, Bernacke says, I'm not going to tell you.
[03:25:09.700 --> 03:25:15.700]  Well, the same thing has started up here. So Webster, with your X-ray vision on this, what's really going on?
[03:25:15.700 --> 03:25:23.700]  The main thing is we've had a large economic power of the world, Germany, which is usually the world's number one exporter right now.
[03:25:23.700 --> 03:25:27.700]  I guess they're neck and neck with China, who's the biggest exporter in the world.
[03:25:27.700 --> 03:25:35.700]  They have dared to violate the rules of globalization and this casino economy by taking action against derivatives.
[03:25:35.700 --> 03:25:42.700]  And specifically, they've targeted one of the most dangerous kinds of derivatives, which is the credit default swap, which is simply a bet.
[03:25:42.700 --> 03:25:44.700]  It means that you make a bet.
[03:25:44.700 --> 03:25:46.700]  You've always said ban those.
[03:25:46.700 --> 03:25:48.700]  Yeah, ban them. I'm very gratified.
[03:25:48.700 --> 03:25:51.700]  And naked shorting.
[03:25:51.700 --> 03:26:02.700]  Right. So they say, if you want to buy, if you want to place a bet, a credit default swap on a bond issued by one of the Euroland countries.
[03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:05.700]  There are 16 countries that are in the Euro.
[03:26:05.700 --> 03:26:12.700]  You've got to own those euros, those bonds yourself, before you can buy a bet on them.
[03:26:12.700 --> 03:26:16.700]  Because the argument always is, well, we just use these as hedging for insurance.
[03:26:16.700 --> 03:26:20.700]  So fine. You're going to hedge. You've got to be in there with skin in the game.
[03:26:20.700 --> 03:26:22.700]  You've got to have some of those bonds in your possession.
[03:26:22.700 --> 03:26:29.700]  So the net effect of this is to make certain kinds of credit default swaps illegal, banned, outlawed.
[03:26:29.700 --> 03:26:32.700]  And, you know, I don't know whether it's jail time or what it is.
[03:26:32.700 --> 03:26:40.700]  And you must do it because the bankers can go in and tens of billions of dollars a day, manipulate markets and never really invest anything.
[03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:43.700]  Absolutely. They can do this at a distance from afar.
[03:26:43.700 --> 03:26:52.700]  Now, Rush Limbaugh every day is telling everybody how great the banks are, how wonderful Wall Street is, and how, I guess, credit default swaps are really your friend.
[03:26:52.700 --> 03:27:04.700]  Just remember, if you're upset about the 180 billion U.S. dollars that was given to AIG, that was all because of one hedge fund, the AIG hedge fund in London,
[03:27:04.700 --> 03:27:14.700]  that issued credit default swaps to the tune of, well, well, along with other derivatives, three trillion U.S. dollars about as much as the gross domestic product of France.
[03:27:14.700 --> 03:27:25.700]  The other one is in the Goldman Sachs scandal that we've just had with the synthetic CDOs, the way in which Goldman Sachs bet against their own product, so-called, was using credit default swaps.
[03:27:25.700 --> 03:27:30.700]  And we have the one example of Timberwolf where it's all premeditated, so let's understand this.
[03:27:30.700 --> 03:27:35.700]  Since they already destroyed the world economy, they're not slowing down.
[03:27:35.700 --> 03:27:42.700]  They're accelerating the looting because their vampire zombies, as you so well lay out the analogy, they can't stop.
[03:27:42.700 --> 03:27:46.700]  They've got to have blood. They're never going to stop. It's us or them.
[03:27:46.700 --> 03:27:56.700]  Precisely. So the Germans have, they surprised everybody on Tuesday, the 19th of May, I guess it was, by saying it was five o'clock in the afternoon in Frankfurt,
[03:27:56.700 --> 03:28:10.700]  and they said, guess what, at midnight Central European time, naked credit default swaps are illegal on Eurozone bonds, and you're not allowed to short to do naked shorting of the 10 largest financial stocks in Germany.
[03:28:10.700 --> 03:28:13.700]  It's starting with the bank's insurance companies, reinsurance, and so forth.
[03:28:13.700 --> 03:28:24.700]  And the reason for this is that the speculative attack of the hedge fund of the various Soros' and Greenlight capital and the rest of them is done through credit default swaps.
[03:28:24.700 --> 03:28:28.700]  It's a very efficient way to get a big panic going for a very small investment.
[03:28:28.700 --> 03:28:33.700]  And Germany understands this is economic warfare. They're not going along with it, so this is a huge development.
[03:28:33.700 --> 03:28:38.700]  Precisely. So what, and they've got a bill in the parliament now which says,
[03:28:38.700 --> 03:28:47.700]  there is no naked shorting of any German stock, any stock primarily listed on a German exchange, no naked shorts, no naked shorts of Eurozone bonds,
[03:28:47.700 --> 03:28:53.700]  and no naked shorting of the Euro itself. So all of this is to put up firewalls against these speculators.
[03:28:53.700 --> 03:29:00.700]  In other words, they're in the process now of re-regulating their marketplace, getting away from the insanity of this free market, free trade.
[03:29:00.700 --> 03:29:04.700]  And if this spreads, this is a lot bigger than Greece fighting back or Iceland.
[03:29:04.700 --> 03:29:10.700]  If this spreads, this could spell the end of these people. Now, separately, here in the United States, it's the opposite.
[03:29:10.700 --> 03:29:20.700]  They passed their new bank regulation bill and it gives the megabanks the power to gobble up more small banks, healthy banks that weren't involved in all of that.
[03:29:20.700 --> 03:29:25.700]  So, Webster, I want you to see how the lines converge, where you see this going on the other side.
[03:29:25.700 --> 03:29:54.700]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:54.700 --> 03:30:03.700]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:03.700 --> 03:30:10.700]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:10.700 --> 03:30:15.700]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:20.700]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:20.700 --> 03:30:25.700]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:25.700 --> 03:30:29.700]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:29.700 --> 03:30:35.700]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:30:35.700 --> 03:30:38.700]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:38.700 --> 03:30:53.700]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.

[03:32:14.700 --> 03:32:18.700]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:32:18.700 --> 03:32:22.700]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:32:22.700 --> 03:32:29.700]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[03:32:29.700 --> 03:32:34.700]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:32:34.700 --> 03:32:39.700]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:32:39.700 --> 03:32:45.700]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:32:45.700 --> 03:33:12.700]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:33:12.700 --> 03:33:17.700]  We've got about 27 minutes left here in broadcast. Thank you again for joining us.
[03:33:17.700 --> 03:33:28.700]  I'm Alex Jones. The websites are infowars.com, I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:33:28.700 --> 03:33:34.700]  We are fighting the formation of the prison planet through the info war.
[03:33:34.700 --> 03:33:41.700]  We're not left or right. We're freedom lovers. We're truth tellers. We are a society of truth.
[03:33:41.700 --> 03:33:51.700]  We're looking for the truth. And the truth is, in all races, colors, creeds, we are one race, the human race, reaching towards the stars.
[03:33:51.700 --> 03:33:58.700]  And we have Ennis, the most horrible things, and we have the greatest things as well, all within us as a human community.
[03:33:58.700 --> 03:34:09.700]  And I'm trying to get people to realize there's an agenda going on around them, that there is a power elite on this planet that does not have your best interest at heart.
[03:34:09.700 --> 03:34:15.700]  It's just that simple. And that you need to get involved in your daily life and stand up for your freedom.
[03:34:15.700 --> 03:34:20.700]  You know, you can't have the attitude, oh, it's too big, things are too corrupt. What could little old me do?
[03:34:20.700 --> 03:34:28.700]  Well, if little old me doesn't start doing a little something, we know we're in deep trouble. We know things are only going to get worse.
[03:34:28.700 --> 03:34:35.700]  Because the truth is, little old you isn't little old you. You have great power and history has shown that.
[03:34:35.700 --> 03:34:41.700]  That's why we have a scientific dictatorship racing to block off every avenue of human escape.
[03:34:41.700 --> 03:34:46.700]  But they're not godlike, they're not invincible, they're not in full control.
[03:34:46.700 --> 03:34:53.700]  In fact, they're losing control. They are delusional believing that they can dominate and control us.
[03:34:53.700 --> 03:35:00.700]  It doesn't matter how much surveillance, how much oppression they have, if you stand up and say no, this tyranny will come crashing down.
[03:35:00.700 --> 03:35:07.700]  We then have to replace it with our Americanism, with our freedom, with our liberty, with our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:13.700]  We have to replace it. I'm a restorationist. I want my liberties and freedoms back. I'm not a revolutionary.
[03:35:13.700 --> 03:35:17.700]  We're fighting revolutionaries. We're firing piratical revolutionaries.
[03:35:17.700 --> 03:35:24.700]  Going back to Webster Tarpley and then your phone calls here in just a moment, but I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that made today's radio broadcast possible.
[03:35:24.700 --> 03:35:31.700]  One of them is AkolaBlue.com. Did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right out of the air you breathe?
[03:35:31.700 --> 03:35:39.700]  No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book. Our sponsor, AkolaBlue, with the AkolaBlue 28 and their brand new AkolaBlue 30 machines will allow you to do just that.
[03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:43.700]  It's easy to use and will make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day.
[03:35:43.700 --> 03:35:51.700]  The water once generated passes through 7 or 12, depending on the unit you get, stage filtering process including reverse osmosis and carbon filtration techniques,
[03:35:51.700 --> 03:35:56.700]  ensuring that you know exactly what you are drinking. No chemicals, pollutants or fluorine.
[03:35:56.700 --> 03:36:03.700]  We spend so much time talking about on this radio broadcast. Check them out at AkolaBlue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[03:36:03.700 --> 03:36:10.700]  AkolaBlue.com or give them a call at 800-691-6043 to get an information packet or to order.
[03:36:10.700 --> 03:36:15.700]  800-691-6043. Take action today.
[03:36:15.700 --> 03:36:22.700]  And one other sponsor that I just love is Weapons Universe.
[03:36:22.700 --> 03:36:33.700]  And they've got tasers, they've got pocket knives, they've got swords from ornamental to the real thing, and they've got great prices, and they are patriots.
[03:36:33.700 --> 03:36:46.700]  Weapons-Universe.com, that's Weapons-Universe.com. Whether you need knives or stun guns, blow guns, collapsible batons, they have it all at Weapons-Universe.com.
[03:36:46.700 --> 03:36:53.700]  They have authentic movie replica swords, like that awesome folded steel conan sword I showed you once.
[03:36:53.700 --> 03:37:03.700]  It's Weapons-Universe.com. Check them out today. And why do we love weapons? Because it's the mark of a free man and a serious check and balance against tyranny.
[03:37:03.700 --> 03:37:16.700]  But you first have to have the initiative to peaceably speak out. And because if you won't speak out peaceably when we're in this realm of conflict, you certainly aren't going to stand up if it goes with something physical, which we're trying to avert each and every day.
[03:37:16.700 --> 03:37:21.700]  Okay, Webster, I promise to go to calls. We appreciate your time, but I need to move quickly here. So finish up.
[03:37:21.700 --> 03:37:29.700]  Alex, one last thing now. So the big thing is Geithner goes to Germany, and he tries to beat up the German finance minister, Schoibler.
[03:37:29.700 --> 03:37:37.700]  And he basically says to him, take back your ban on these derivatives. We believe derivatives are sacrosanct. Get your hands off our derivatives.
[03:37:37.700 --> 03:37:46.700]  And Schoibler tells him to get lost, to scram. So the clash is set up as a meeting of the group of 20 finance ministers in Seoul, South Korea this week.
[03:37:46.700 --> 03:37:56.700]  The clash goes on. And then there's going to be this international, the group of eight big industrial countries in Ottawa in July.
[03:37:56.700 --> 03:38:08.700]  The Europeans, under German leadership to some extent, are proposing measures against derivatives, a Tobentech, to tax the turnover of financial institutions and use that money.
[03:38:08.700 --> 03:38:16.700]  But as long as that's done domestically, it's okay. We don't want the UN running the Tobentech.
[03:38:16.700 --> 03:38:23.700]  Not the UN, not the IMF, none of this. The country is needed. Everybody says, oh, there's a deficit crisis in all these countries.
[03:38:23.700 --> 03:38:27.700]  And finally, rules against hedge funds, because we've had enough of these hedge funds.
[03:38:27.700 --> 03:38:34.700]  So the basic idea is, you're hearing a lot of people say, this is a crisis through the welfare state. That is absolute baloney.
[03:38:34.700 --> 03:38:44.700]  The Greeks have 18% unemployment. They have 20% poverty. Spain has 20% unemployment. The IMF comes in and says, you guys are profligate.
[03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:56.700]  We have an austerity program for you. You're going to get gouged. We give the money to the bailouts, because as you correctly point out, the bailout of Greece is really a bailout of French and German banks, not of Greece at all.
[03:38:56.700 --> 03:39:03.700]  So what is failing is this globalized casino economy of derivatives, hedge funds, and hot money. That's what's failing.
[03:39:03.700 --> 03:39:13.700]  Well, Webster, let's go back to 19 months ago, back in October. They said we need these trillions of dollars, or the entire economy is going to go into a depression.
[03:39:13.700 --> 03:39:22.700]  It's to unfreeze mortgages. And then the next day, literally, they say, we're not spending it on that now. We're not going to tell you where it's going.
[03:39:22.700 --> 03:39:33.700]  But just briefly, how do you see the power structure breaks? Because we saw the concerted bailout a year and a half ago. Now we see fishers cracking here.
[03:39:33.700 --> 03:39:44.700]  You're right when you say that these investment banks and brokerage firms can't control themselves. They're even attacking the national governments now that give them all this power.
[03:39:44.700 --> 03:39:56.700]  And then you have what appears to be delusion. Many of the top globalists running around saying we'll just form a world government where the banks have all the power and where we have SDRs where we just make up our own money.
[03:39:56.700 --> 03:40:05.700]  But then you have Brzezinski, and I want to get your take on this two weeks ago, saying, look, for the first time the whole world is awake to us. We're in trouble.
[03:40:05.700 --> 03:40:15.700]  So it appears that they are having trouble in their concerted actions and that the wheels are beginning to come off. So what do you say about Brzezinski?
[03:40:15.700 --> 03:40:22.700]  I think we're headed towards a world now where, in the immediate short run, you're going to have two blocks. There's going to be the derivatives block.
[03:40:22.700 --> 03:40:38.700]  The people who say derivatives are the basis of human civilization. That's the U.S. and the British. Then there's the anti-derivatives block saying, no, as shortlist says, production of goods and services has to be the basis of human civilization, not derivatives.
[03:40:38.700 --> 03:40:53.700]  Ultimately, the plans of these globalist thinkers that you point to, they are insane because what they will get is not a world government. They will get the breakdown of human civilization. They'll get warlords. They'll get chaos.
[03:40:53.700 --> 03:41:06.700]  They'll get death on a vast scale. They will not get some kind of an orderly descent into a dark age where they think that they can continue with some worldwide dictatorship of the United Nations.
[03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:24.700]  By the way, they've said that. You've read their own documents. We're interviewing you for the next film on this subject. But they want a global eugenics, Malthusian capital where we're literally in loincloths, those that they allowed to live while they fly above us like Skynet with drones.
[03:41:24.700 --> 03:41:37.700]  This doesn't work. It will never work this way. In other words, they will lose control of everything long before that. The problem is, this existing ruling class of financiers, because that's who they are, like Wall Street City of London.
[03:41:37.700 --> 03:41:54.700]  They drank their own kool-aid because it's the world, and they believe that their power is eternal. They will be swept away at some point or other in this entire thing. The problem is that they can drag down human civilization into some kind of a catastrophic breakdown crisis and collapse, and we're all in the soup.
[03:41:54.700 --> 03:42:09.700]  The point is, remember from the 1930s, depression, dictatorship, world war. We're still in the depression phase. If you fight to stop the depression with a recovery program, you can avoid the dictatorship phase and you can avoid the world war phase.
[03:42:09.700 --> 03:42:16.700]  But you've got to fight the depression. You can't say, let the free market take care of it, balance the budget. That is absolutely suicidal nonsense.
[03:42:16.700 --> 03:42:28.700]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt. This is not a free market. This is crony insider capitalism. But now, I'm sure, let's move very quickly now, because I promise to go to these calls and get your take on their questions.
[03:42:28.700 --> 03:42:52.700]  To me, I mean, we've been expecting a war, at least a regional war. All these big think tanks say, we need a war during these crises. We need a war right now as a political diversion. We see the North Korea situation. We see the Gaza flotilla. What is going on here from your research? What do you see happening?
[03:42:52.700 --> 03:43:07.700]  Well, I think the main thing that you see is, first of all, that the world depression behind the scenes is destroying countries. If you look at what happened in Thailand, I think that's an example of a country going into a breakdown crisis because of the collapse of the world economy around it.
[03:43:07.700 --> 03:43:30.700]  In other words, the multiplication of failed states. Now, the other thing concerning maybe the Middle East and Iran in particular, you can see that the U.S. is losing world domination at a very rapid rate. You have, for example, Karzai in Afghanistan playing the China card, essentially slipping into the Chinese orbit, making economic deals with China.
[03:43:30.700 --> 03:43:47.700]  All over the Middle East, you've got the Chinese on an economic offensive. You've got the Iranians on a religious and cultural offensive. And the U.S. really has nothing to offer against that except naked military power. But that doesn't work either.
[03:43:47.700 --> 03:44:10.700]  You see, in Iraq, the attempt of the U.S. is to keep this guy Maliki out of power, to kick him out, and to bring in Alawi, who was much more of a U.S. puppet. And Alawi would allow the U.S. to use Iraq along with Saudi Arabia and some other countries to try to create an Arab Sunni front against the Iranians.
[03:44:10.700 --> 03:44:20.700]  And that's not working. A launch point. Then you look at the Ukraine. The color revolution has been rolled back. Ukraine is no longer a candidate. The Georgia attack failed on South Ossetian.
[03:44:20.700 --> 03:44:43.700]  Ukraine has decided that they don't want to join NATO. Instead, they've made another long-term deal to host the Russian fleet in the ports of the Black Sea. In Iran, the color revolution has failed there, too. What you're seeing is the U.S. forced more and more back on the only option, naked military force, with no moral basis, in a point where it's not even clear if that will work.
[03:44:43.700 --> 03:45:07.700]  Now, if you look specifically, countries like Egypt, the Chinese economic penetration of Egypt is going very fast. You've also got Turkey. Now, one of the things that's happening is, as the U.S. power recedes, you've got the emergence either of regional superpowers or of regional superpowers that are sort of rivaling among themselves.
[03:45:07.700 --> 03:45:15.700]  Iran is a candidate to be a regional superpower. Turkey would like to be a regional superpower, and they seem to be moving faster than anybody.
[03:45:15.700 --> 03:45:18.700]  Well, before, in the Ottoman Empire, they ran it all, yeah.
[03:45:18.700 --> 03:45:26.700]  Precisely. And Egypt, probably people in Egypt wonder why they don't do more to try to become a regional superpower.
[03:45:26.700 --> 03:45:55.700]  So it's just like when Spain and Portugal lost power in the New World, England and the Dutch replaced it. We're already seeing the United States used up and literally losing its power as the Chinese and the Germans and others come in as the new technocratic suppliers with soft power and are literally colonizing these third world and old world areas with high-tech versions of glass bobbles.
[03:45:55.700 --> 03:46:08.700]  Just remember, though, that there's no ultimate reason for the U.S. decline except our own folly in allowing Wall Street financiers to make all the main decisions in the society, right?
[03:46:08.700 --> 03:46:15.700]  The reason the Chinese get ahead is that they have a much more industrial goods producing manufacturing.
[03:46:15.700 --> 03:46:32.700]  No, no, I understand, but tartly, tartly, tartly, specifically, we're almost out of time. I want to get your take on Israel's activity and Turkey openly threatening, saying they're sending warships for frigates in to protect the next aid ship and saying this could mean war.
[03:46:32.700 --> 03:46:37.700]  I mean, and I think Israel is out of control enough, they may attack Turkey now.
[03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:50.700]  Well, what the Israelis have done, of course, is a very serious breach of international law. It's either an act of war or it's a crime. In any case, it has to be condemned, and it is being condemned all around the world.
[03:46:50.700 --> 03:47:04.700]  The Israelis are more isolated than they've ever been, and I think in addition to the criminal aspect of this under international law, you also have to wonder, what are the Israelis thinking?
[03:47:04.700 --> 03:47:14.700]  Where do they think this leads? In other words, they've lost sight of the fact that if you don't have a moral basis for force, this is going to be bankrupt and it's not going to get anywhere.
[03:47:14.700 --> 03:47:22.700]  Now, usually, the Israelis would expect that the United States would shield them from the negative blowback in the UN and so forth.
[03:47:22.700 --> 03:47:40.700]  What I'm seeing right now is the US may already be too weak to shield Israel from the blowback on this incident, this attack that they've done, and you can see that in the fact that you've got these new countries coming on the scene.
[03:47:40.700 --> 03:48:06.700]  You notice that Turkey, which is the protagonist of what just happened, along with Brazil, these are both temporary members of the Security Council, they were the ones that tried to get Iran to make an arrangement to send some of their uranium into Turkey and have it enriched there and then sent back to them as fuel rods for this research reactor, which has attracted so much attention.
[03:48:06.700 --> 03:48:17.700]  And the US had nothing to say to that, even though this was exactly what the US had asked for six months earlier and kept saying they wanted, and then they just say, no, that's no good anymore.
[03:48:17.700 --> 03:48:34.700]  And this is just, it makes absolutely no sense. When you start alienating countries like Turkey and Brazil, when these are now regional superpowers, you're getting to a situation where this entire US-British imperial edifice is in danger of collapsing.
[03:48:34.700 --> 03:48:50.700]  The other thing you may get is a NATO crisis. Remember, the countries that have sent these ships are not in our terrorist states. They're Turkey, Ireland, and Greece. They're all members of NATO. They're all members of NATO, the European Union.
[03:48:50.700 --> 03:48:58.700]  Yeah, all the ships were inspected. All the Israelis can show us some four-inch, five-inch knives, and they're now calling those WMDs.
[03:48:58.700 --> 03:49:10.700]  They've found no guns. There are no weapons, no explosives. They've undoubtedly gone through it. I would be very skeptical if they come up with any, because the ship, in particular, the large ship was loaded under the supervision of the Turkish government.
[03:49:10.700 --> 03:49:34.700]  So, a NATO crisis simply is that Turkey is one of the most important NATO countries. You look at that insurlic air force space, right? That's the key for the whole Iranian and Middle East presence of the United States. Generally speaking, without the NATO logistics and military-facing infrastructure, the US is logistically so weak that it could not project any kind of power into the Middle East.
[03:49:34.700 --> 03:49:50.700]  Well, here's the issue. The Anglo-American, US, Israel, British Empire isn't going to back off. They're arrogant because they've got a plan, and I believe it's to start a nuclear war. Now, enter what happened in Korea. Does that smell like a false flag to you?
[03:49:50.700 --> 03:50:19.700]  Yes, obviously the suspicion around this is very grave, because the main idea is that, as a general proposition, it's absolutely clear that the United States has always used North Korea and the North Korean military nuclear issue as a means of keeping South Korea in line and Japan, especially during all the stuff going on with Afghanistan and then mainly Iraq.
[03:50:19.700 --> 03:50:37.700]  The thing that kept the US position solid or relatively solid in the Far East was the fact that North Korea was there, and everybody had to be afraid of them. So, if they've now gone one step further and actually done something, that's not clear whether they have, but that would fit perfectly.
[03:50:37.700 --> 03:50:43.700]  It could be a mine left over from the war of 60 years ago. It could be a torpedo fired by somebody, maybe by...
[03:50:43.700 --> 03:50:54.700]  We know a big multi... We know a big US slash South Korean drill was going on in these waters. When this happens, stay there, Webster. We'll try to get us some calls.
[03:50:54.700 --> 03:50:57.700]  Don't answer it.

[03:51:54.700 --> 03:51:59.700]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:51:59.700 --> 03:52:02.700]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[03:52:02.700 --> 03:52:06.700]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:52:06.700 --> 03:52:10.700]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:52:10.700 --> 03:52:16.700]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[03:52:16.700 --> 03:52:20.700]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:52:20.700 --> 03:52:24.700]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[03:52:24.700 --> 03:52:29.700]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[03:52:29.700 --> 03:52:33.700]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[03:52:33.700 --> 03:52:35.700]  Don't tread on me, rise of the republic.
[03:52:35.700 --> 03:52:40.700]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:52:40.700 --> 03:52:54.700]  A new tool in the info war, don't tread on me, order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:53:10.700 --> 03:53:14.700]  Remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride and contaminants from municipal water.
[03:53:14.700 --> 03:53:20.700]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[03:53:53.700 --> 03:54:05.700]  We're almost out of time and I got a lot of other informative guests coming up throughout the week, but I'm going to have to block off maybe some whole shows this week.
[03:54:05.700 --> 03:54:09.700]  Probably nothing but take calls because I apologize, I shouldn't even open the phones up.
[03:54:09.700 --> 03:54:14.700]  I'm not going to get to your calls, Matt, George, Brad, the blue dove, Ken, I apologize to y'all.
[03:54:14.700 --> 03:54:18.700]  I'll try to get to one or two and then be back tomorrow at 11am central, 12 noon eastern.
[03:54:18.700 --> 03:54:24.700]  But we're going to go to those here in just a second, but Webster, finishing up before we take a call or two.
[03:54:24.700 --> 03:54:33.700]  I mean, this is exactly what we keep talking about, month in, month out, is how at the key point of crisis, these interests are going to start wars.
[03:54:33.700 --> 03:54:36.700]  And then, voila, everything that's happening makes no sense.
[03:54:36.700 --> 03:54:48.700]  I mean, why would North Korea do this right at the perfect time to keep the U.S. there when the U.S. was about to be kicked out of Japan?
[03:54:48.700 --> 03:54:53.700]  It makes no sense at all and there's going to be an international investigation.
[03:54:53.700 --> 03:54:57.700]  I think there's a group of Russian experts who are looking into it and you probably need others to it.
[03:54:57.700 --> 03:54:59.700]  It would have to be multinational.
[03:54:59.700 --> 03:55:07.700]  Just in terms of the Middle East, though, I think it's time for the Israelis to realize that they've come to the end of the line with the current policy.
[03:55:07.700 --> 03:55:12.700]  They should immediately end the blockade of Gaza, which is the main issue here.
[03:55:12.700 --> 03:55:19.700]  And I think the Israeli people have to realize that Netanyahu is a luxury they cannot afford.
[03:55:19.700 --> 03:55:34.700]  In other words, this kind of incompetent domination, it reminds us of the terrible price paid by the Israelis for the Rabin assassination and then the kinds of leaders that they've had after the killing of Rabin 15 years ago.
[03:55:34.700 --> 03:55:46.700]  And I think their situation is, like many other parts of the world, including our own, the political elite has absolutely lost touch with reality and with the needs of the population.
[03:55:46.700 --> 03:56:00.700]  Well, this attack shows that. I mean, what a PR disaster to do something like this or at least stop the ship when it docked and walk up and talk nicely to them and say, you've got, you know, but no.
[03:56:00.700 --> 03:56:10.700]  I mean, just none of this. And now you've got members of the Knesset coming out saying, no, Israel did fire first, so they ran the white flag up.
[03:56:10.700 --> 03:56:14.700]  I mean, this is amazing brazen behavior.
[03:56:14.700 --> 03:56:20.700]  It's Netanyahu. And then some some members of his coalition that are that are even less in touch with the reality than he is.
[03:56:20.700 --> 03:56:27.700]  Notice that these the ships were some of them were sponsored by Mahatir Muhammad, the former Prime Minister of Malaysia.
[03:56:27.700 --> 03:56:35.700]  They were loaded in Turkey, Ireland and Greece under the supervision, obviously, of the police and intelligence services of those countries.
[03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:41.700]  There are no firearms on board. The Israelis have now got a large group of prisoners.
[03:56:41.700 --> 03:56:50.700]  I think at 480 prisoners. And according to one of them is a famous Swedish writer by the name of Henning Mankel, well known over there.
[03:56:50.700 --> 03:56:57.700]  He says he was given a choice either sign a document and be deported and he didn't want to sign it or be put on on trial.
[03:56:57.700 --> 03:57:02.700]  I think if they try to put some of these people on trial, that will have a terrible effect.
[03:57:02.700 --> 03:57:07.700]  The Israelis say that they're transferring 124 to Jordan. There are more ships coming.
[03:57:07.700 --> 03:57:14.700]  Apparently, there's an Irish ship which is still on its way. And Mahatir Muhammad said last night that there are ships sponsored by Malaysia,
[03:57:14.700 --> 03:57:20.700]  which are coming from farther away, which will continue to arrive. So there's no end to this.
[03:57:20.700 --> 03:57:25.700]  And the Knesset member says that Israel wanted blood to intimidate people.
[03:57:25.700 --> 03:57:33.700]  But as the blitz showed in London and many other wars, when you really start brutalizing people at a certain point, it makes them get more angry.
[03:57:33.700 --> 03:57:44.700]  It doesn't have the desired effect. And now Turkey, I mean, that's a bold move to say they're sending four frigates and destroyers with these new ships.
[03:57:44.700 --> 03:57:49.700]  I mean, this is Webster. This is how World War starts.
[03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:56.700]  It's a very dangerous situation. And again, the people in Israel would be very well advised not to turn away from the current path.
[03:57:56.700 --> 03:58:02.700]  The best thing to do is announce immediate end to the Gaza blockade. This makes no sense anymore.
[03:58:02.700 --> 03:58:07.700]  That would probably lead to the fall of Netanyahu, maybe early elections or something like this.
[03:58:07.700 --> 03:58:11.700]  And then hopefully a government that would be prepared to negotiate.
[03:58:11.700 --> 03:58:15.700]  Webster, we're out of time. God bless you. We'll talk to you again soon, folks. Thank you.
[03:58:15.700 --> 03:58:21.700]  We carry all four Webster Tarpleys books, the two books in Obama, the book on the economic crash, and his book on 9-11.
