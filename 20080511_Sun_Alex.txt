[00:00.000 --> 00:05.040]  being blamed for a death in Georgia. Authorities say at least one person was killed as storms
[00:05.040 --> 00:10.360]  rumbled across the state. Twisters are being blamed for at least 19 deaths in Missouri
[00:10.360 --> 00:15.120]  and Oklahoma. Keith Stammer is a spokesman for the Newton County, Missouri Office of
[00:15.120 --> 00:19.280]  Emergency Management. You'll find some houses that are entirely collapsed. You'll find some
[00:19.280 --> 00:23.760]  that just have walls torn down, planking off on the side, roof shingles spread out over
[00:23.760 --> 00:27.560]  the place, that sort of thing. And Myanmar State Television says the death toll in last
[00:27.560 --> 00:33.320]  week's cyclone has climbed above 28,000. Australia Foreign Minister Stephen Smith says yesterday's
[00:33.320 --> 00:37.840]  referendum on Myanmar's military-backed constitution took place without incident.
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.680]  I again make the point as I've made consistently, Australia regards the referendum processes
[00:42.680 --> 00:48.000]  nothing more, nothing less than a sham, and our view would be the referendum process be
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.680]  deferred completely. This is IRN USA, ready for news.
[00:51.680 --> 00:57.880]  If you're in debt and have very little money saved for retirement, you've probably asked
[00:57.880 --> 01:02.000]  yourself the question, what am I going to do? I'm Scott Elder and this is a question
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.360]  I asked myself 11 years ago. I got my answer when I asked my friend Ross Jardine if he
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.520]  would teach me how to make money trading stocks. In the first three weeks, I made more money
[01:10.520 --> 01:14.360]  trading my puny retirement account than the account managers had made in the previous
[01:14.360 --> 01:18.520]  10 years. I was so excited that I told Ross that he needed to teach others who were in
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.280]  the same desperate situation and that's what Ross has been doing now for the past 10 years.
[01:23.280 --> 01:26.960]  Hi, I'm Ross Jardine. I taught thousands of people how to make money in the stock market.
[01:26.960 --> 01:31.560]  Let me help you by sending you my free stock investor toolkit. Today, I'm no longer broke
[01:31.560 --> 01:35.320]  and I'm no longer in debt. Thanks to what Ross taught me. If you're ready to get out
[01:35.320 --> 01:40.240]  of debt and build wealth, Ross can show you how to. To receive Ross's free investor toolkit,
[01:40.240 --> 01:47.080]  call 888-845-4059. That's 888-845-4059. And starting enjoying the peace of mind that
[01:47.080 --> 01:53.920]  having money and no debt can bring. That's 888-845-4059.
[01:53.920 --> 01:58.320]  Mothers across the country are being treated to cards, meals and gifts on this Mother's
[01:58.320 --> 02:04.520]  Day. The National Retail Federation estimates Americans will spend $15 billion honoring
[02:04.520 --> 02:10.400]  their mothers this year. The number one expense, dining out. But retail expert Britt Beamer
[02:10.400 --> 02:14.840]  says stores didn't do well this year for presents involving mom.
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.520]  Mother's Day gifts that actually retail levels, whether you're looking at perfume or other
[02:19.520 --> 02:24.720]  things like that, they made me doubt I would take at least 5, 10%, maybe 15% this year.
[02:24.720 --> 02:29.520]  An international Red Cross spokesman is calling in a big blow to the already slow relief work
[02:29.520 --> 02:35.840]  in Myanmar. A cargo ship carrying relief supplies for more than 1,000 cyclone victims sank after
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.240]  it had submerged a tree trunk. And security officials say heavy fighting
[02:40.240 --> 02:45.000]  has broken out between supporters of Lebanon's Western-backed government and opposition followers
[02:45.000 --> 03:14.320]  in the mountains overlooking Beirut. For more news and analysis, log on to IRN News.com.
[03:14.320 --> 03:29.080]  As Democrats are looking for a way to push through a bill to pay for the war in Iraq,
[03:29.080 --> 03:32.920]  here's Jerry Bodelander. Conservative Democrats who support pay-as-you-go
[03:32.920 --> 03:38.000]  rules scuttled the original plan to add new education benefits for Iraq war veterans to
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.160]  the war-spending bill. They insisted the roughly $50 billion cost
[03:42.160 --> 03:54.440]  somehow be offset despite the delay Speaker Nancy Pelosi remains optimistic. The administration
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.720]  is threatening a veto not only because of the added cost of the veterans benefits but
[03:58.720 --> 04:02.960]  also because the measure would include an extension of jobless benefits.
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.720]  Jerry Bodelander, Capitol Hill. A memorabilia dealer who profited from
[04:06.720 --> 04:12.560]  Moje Sampson for many years is the latest person to write a tell-all book claiming Sampson
[04:12.560 --> 04:17.520]  confessed to him that he killed his ex-wife. Here's Linda Deutsch.
[04:17.520 --> 04:24.400]  He also claims that while Sampson was in jail waiting trial, Gilbert told him that he should
[04:24.400 --> 04:30.840]  stop taking his arthritis medicines because then his hands would swell up and they wouldn't
[04:30.840 --> 04:34.240]  fit into the gloves. And authorities in Baghdad's sadder city
[04:34.240 --> 04:39.560]  neighborhood are reporting no violence as militants have been withdrawing from the streets.
[04:39.560 --> 04:45.360]  It's the first day of a ceasefire between Shiite extremists and U.S.-backed Iraqi forces
[04:45.360 --> 04:51.120]  following two months of intense clashes. I'm Jerry Jordan and that's news from the Information
[04:51.120 --> 04:56.240]  Radio Network. Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most

[06:30.400 --> 06:39.400]  Jones. Welcome, my friends. Welcome to this live Sunday edition. We're here every Sunday,
[06:39.400 --> 06:45.160]  4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. I, of course, have a syndicated broadcast now for 12 years
[06:45.160 --> 06:52.040]  that is ongoing weekdays, 11 to 3. But that's not enough. Sundays, we come in for an abbreviated
[06:52.040 --> 06:59.480]  two-hour transmission against tyranny in the name, of course, of liberty. 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[06:59.480 --> 07:05.920]  Standard Time, syndicated from stations out in Southern California to right here in Austin,
[07:05.920 --> 07:12.480]  Texas, from Kansas City, Missouri to upstate New York, from Tampa, Florida to, of course,
[07:12.480 --> 07:17.320]  Southern Illinois. We are here and we're live today. Thank you for tuning in. Thank you for
[07:17.320 --> 07:18.320]  joining us.
[07:18.320 --> 07:24.040]  I'm going to take some phone calls and, you know, I hate to, I really do hate to make this
[07:24.040 --> 07:28.640]  radio show about this radio show, but more and more, we have to cover some of the things
[07:28.640 --> 07:36.040]  that have developed here. First off, Deborah Jean Palfrey, of course, about two weeks ago,
[07:36.040 --> 07:42.240]  reportedly committed suicide, though she told me and my listeners and her friends and family
[07:42.240 --> 07:46.240]  and countless others that she would never commit suicide and thought that there was
[07:46.240 --> 07:53.200]  a, quote, contract killing out on her. Didn't matter if she told everybody that. They still
[07:53.200 --> 07:58.600]  came for her. Didn't matter that we got copies of her real handwriting and it really looks
[07:58.600 --> 08:05.760]  nothing like what the government put out. It doesn't matter because CNN has come out
[08:05.760 --> 08:12.200]  and basically done a 10 minute piece trying to decipher and trying to break down and trying
[08:12.200 --> 08:16.280]  to dismantle the information that we brought forward. I'm going to play a few minutes of
[08:16.280 --> 08:24.200]  this later and analyze a few of the points. I rarely go on vacation, but I did take off
[08:24.200 --> 08:27.760]  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, went down to the Texas beach. I'm going to say
[08:27.760 --> 08:31.680]  hi to my aunt and uncle driving back to East Texas. They were visiting with us there as
[08:31.680 --> 08:36.440]  well and my grandmother, great-grandmother to my children, came down to spend time with
[08:36.440 --> 08:42.320]  us as well as my parents. I didn't end up doing some work while I was down there, though,
[08:42.320 --> 08:48.560]  but I have been somewhat unplugged from things. I got back today just a few hours ago and
[08:48.560 --> 08:55.720]  noticed that singing in Saturday had done this little hit piece. We could really tear it
[08:55.720 --> 09:00.000]  to shreds. We will later in the week after we have time to actually break it all down,
[09:00.000 --> 09:05.880]  but there was a few blaring instances of this info that I saw that we'll be going over.
[09:05.880 --> 09:12.320]  This isn't just about a madam who died mysteriously. This is about a media, a corporate mainline
[09:12.320 --> 09:19.000]  media losing all credibility. It's about spinning, twisting, lying. It's about police
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.280]  forces more than happy to go along with what are clear murders. I mean, remember all the
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.440]  arkinsides where they torture people to death and cut their arms and legs off and heads
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.360]  off and burn them with gasoline or machine gun people off the road and then the medical
[09:33.360 --> 09:40.920]  examiner in Arkansas would declare it a suicide or Gary Webb, the Pulitzer Prize winning
[09:40.920 --> 09:46.720]  author who wrote stories for the San Jose Mercury News about the CIA drug running, now
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.040]  confirmed and declassified. He was writing another book about it and got double capped
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.280]  in the head, said he was being followed, feared for his life. It didn't matter if I had friends
[09:55.280 --> 10:00.480]  and family on. The media said, oh, he told people he was going to commit suicide and
[10:00.480 --> 10:04.000]  he said, I'm fearing for my life. They're after me. If I die, it's not a suicide. Then
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.480]  you shoot yourself twice, once on the side, once in the back of the head. I mean, this
[10:08.480 --> 10:14.480]  is just getting more and more ridiculous. So we'll spend a few minutes on that today.
[10:14.480 --> 10:19.920]  Also Tommy Chung, Chung of Cheech and Chung fame and some other movies and of course
[10:19.920 --> 10:28.440]  a popular comedian, he back in 2003 was rated for selling marijuana pipes and doesn't matter
[10:28.440 --> 10:33.360]  if Governor Schwarzenegger smokes pot on television. That's okay. Doesn't matter because marijuana
[10:33.360 --> 10:40.360]  is what 87% of drug users use and they only use marijuana. That is illegal drug users.
[10:40.360 --> 10:44.320]  And so the whole phony war on drugs would collapse if they didn't have it. That's the
[10:44.320 --> 10:48.520]  one drug that the government doesn't ship in and doesn't control. So the very, very
[10:48.520 --> 10:51.880]  upset about that. And they've got to fill up all the private prisons where you work
[10:51.880 --> 10:56.160]  for 20 cents an hour taking everybody else's jobs. That's right, good old boys. Make them
[10:56.160 --> 11:02.500]  criminals work. It takes your jobs, you idiots. And you pay taxes to pay for the private prisons.
[11:02.500 --> 11:09.600]  But that's coming up. Tommy Chung was on my radio show Friday. And so I called in from
[11:09.600 --> 11:16.120]  Port Aransas to ask him a few questions while Jason Burmans was sitting in. We'll play
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.040]  a few minutes of that later coming up as well. And I went ahead and decided to ask him the
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.560]  question, hey, you think 9-11 is an inside job? You know, we ask everybody and he said,
[11:24.560 --> 11:31.160]  yes, I believe 9-11 is an inside job. And that is exactly what he went over with me
[11:31.160 --> 11:36.680]  on the air. And of course, you're saying, well, who cares what he says? Well, okay.
[11:36.680 --> 11:42.960]  But I mean, German defense ministers, Italian presidents, former CIA section chiefs, Western
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.920]  Europe division, I mean, thousands and thousands of prominent engineers and scientists have
[11:47.920 --> 11:54.440]  all gone public. And so that's just one more. Now it's a Tommy Chung. So we'll play some
[11:54.440 --> 12:03.120]  of that coming up today. In other news, gag on second amendment is city's aim in gunsuit.
[12:03.120 --> 12:13.120]  I'm not joking. This is out of the New York sun today. And the mayor says that in these
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.200]  gun confiscation and in gun store shutdown cases, and there he's now trying to expand
[12:18.200 --> 12:22.600]  his authority outside New York through the state and nationwide, that you're not allowed
[12:22.600 --> 12:29.760]  to argue the second amendment and the government puts gags on you on what you can say in court.
[12:29.760 --> 12:32.760]  We now have different branches of government doing things they've never done before. It's
[12:32.760 --> 12:39.520]  called tyranny. I mean, this is what 10 horn dictators and military hunters engage in.
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.640]  But so now they're just saying, hey, gag on second amendment. It says you're not allowed
[12:43.640 --> 12:46.800]  to mention that in court. Now it's not the first time this has happened. This happened
[12:46.800 --> 12:53.000]  in a about five years ago in a federal attack on a gun store and the FBI argued in court
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.960]  that the second amendment is no and void and not arguable. And we have no independent
[12:56.960 --> 13:00.920]  right. You're not allowed to raise it. The court agreed and ban those guns, which it's
[13:00.920 --> 13:06.000]  all about. Government's criminal. But here it is in front of me on a separate issue of
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.280]  courts and tyranny. Doctors condemn threatening Taser court ruling. Physicians speak out on
[13:13.280 --> 13:21.240]  bullying tactics of Taser International over its less than lethal weapons. And in three
[13:21.240 --> 13:30.560]  deaths in one county in Pennsylvania, a state judge, I guess he's got a medical degree now,
[13:30.560 --> 13:39.120]  he told county medical examiners and medical doctors, you are not to say that Taser causes
[13:39.120 --> 13:45.520]  harm. You are not allowed to say that. And now Taser says they're going to sue any doctor
[13:45.520 --> 13:52.000]  or any medical examiner or any medical institution that says 50,000 volts run through the heart
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.800]  causes people to die. Now the deaths are multiplying. They're going to go from 50,000 to 75,000
[13:57.800 --> 14:01.960]  volts. They'll probably start just hooking you directly up to a power pole and watching
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.600]  your eyeballs pop out of your head and fire shoot out of your ears. But it won't matter
[14:06.600 --> 14:14.160]  because the judge says you're not allowed to say it kills you. They're now telling doctors,
[14:14.160 --> 14:20.280]  oh, you can't say that's what made them die. So see the corruption is just completely and
[14:20.280 --> 14:26.400]  totally rampant. But let me just get back into this gag on second amendment is cities
[14:26.400 --> 14:31.880]  aim at gunsuit. Lawyers from air Bloomberg are asking a judge to ban any reference to
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.680]  the second amendment during the upcoming trial of a gun shop owner who has sued the city
[14:36.680 --> 14:40.880]  while trials are often tightly choreographed. See kangaroo trials in this country. You didn't
[14:40.880 --> 14:47.240]  know that with lawyers routinely instructed to not tell certain facts to a jury, a gag
[14:47.240 --> 14:52.280]  order on a section of the Constitution would be an oddity. Now, you know, an oddity, they
[14:52.280 --> 15:01.280]  call raving, rampaging, hardcore, anti Americanism, anti liberty. I mean, this is 101 tyranny.
[15:01.280 --> 15:08.400]  They call it odd. That's like calling Hitler odd or or Stalin odd or Jack the Ripper odd
[15:08.400 --> 15:15.040]  or Ted Bundy odd. Oh, it's so odd. Next time somebody robs a bank and shoots three tellers
[15:15.040 --> 15:23.600]  go, it was odd. Just they just say it doesn't matter what you want, what you say, you have
[15:23.600 --> 15:29.440]  no rights. And we have two million men with machine guns ready to follow orders, eat their
[15:29.440 --> 15:35.400]  guts and ask for seconds. And it's all about taking your private property. Wait, all you
[15:35.400 --> 15:40.160]  yuppies think you're part of the system. You'll soon find out what's happening with the economy
[15:40.160 --> 15:53.680]  is only the beginning of the rape that you're going to receive from your law. Be right back.
[15:53.680 --> 16:01.600]  It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful
[16:01.600 --> 16:09.000]  government is known as the builder bird. But their objective being world domination or thousands
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.560]  of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their
[16:14.560 --> 16:23.720]  great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history,
[16:23.720 --> 16:28.560]  the elites plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that
[16:28.560 --> 16:42.520]  drives the entire new world order agenda. Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or

[16:49.560 --> 17:12.160]  and slave, you have been warned. On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, executive
[17:12.160 --> 17:18.160]  order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power
[17:18.160 --> 17:22.560]  to lend money to the United States government and interest. With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy
[17:22.560 --> 17:26.880]  would have put the Fed out of business. The November assassination quieted the production
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.880]  of the new currency. However, the executive order still stands unrepealed. Midas has the

[17:56.920 --> 18:02.400]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck. If you knew what I know about all the problems
[18:02.400 --> 18:07.560]  food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get
[18:07.560 --> 18:12.600]  into the biggest supply of food possible. When the dollar and economy crash, when the
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.080]  imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and
[18:17.080 --> 18:22.400]  bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of
[18:22.400 --> 18:26.920]  our own supply of food and enough of it. But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered,
[18:26.920 --> 18:30.880]  you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and
[18:30.880 --> 18:36.840]  getting a serious food supply. Decide it's food now or probably never. But can you afford
[18:36.840 --> 18:45.840]  to be wrong? Decide now. Place your bet. Can you afford to be wrong? Call 800-409-5633

[20:43.200 --> 20:50.200]  The Biomedical Weapon System in place. The eugenics program in full swing against you
[20:50.200 --> 20:57.200]  and your family. The architects of society, playing God, control our entire lives. But
[20:57.200 --> 21:04.200]  resistance is forming in the hearts and minds of men and women everywhere.
[21:14.560 --> 21:21.560]  Do you realize the magnitude that a judge is telling medical examiners, medical doctors
[21:21.560 --> 21:28.560]  that they are to change their medical reports and say that tasers have nothing to do with
[21:32.840 --> 21:39.840]  all these people that get tasered and died? Pretty soon they'll just have the company
[21:41.760 --> 21:48.960]  sue doctors when they say that mercury or lead in your water supply from a power plant
[21:48.960 --> 21:53.640]  killed your child. They'll just sue them and the doctors will dance around saying mercury
[21:53.640 --> 22:00.640]  and lead is good for you. I even have a clip from CNBC saying poison and food is good.
[22:02.160 --> 22:07.000]  I even have local CBS television in Austin saying mercury and vaccines is good for your
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  brain. Just Google, mercury is good for your brain. It's the first thing that comes up.
[22:14.000 --> 22:21.000]  That's right. Liberty and freedom are bad. Lead and mercury are good. So is 50,000 volts
[22:23.520 --> 22:30.280]  right into your heart. And so is the Canadian police tasering you if you're caught riding
[22:30.280 --> 22:37.280]  the bus or train without a ticket. And they say we do this as punishment. Yes, welcome
[22:37.280 --> 22:44.280]  to the machine. They're part of the machine too. Those that carry it out, those that think
[22:45.720 --> 22:52.720]  they're in command. Very few are actually in control. And even those that think they
[22:52.720 --> 22:59.120]  are, the few thousand, the global super class, they're in control of nothing. They're riding
[22:59.120 --> 23:06.120]  a wild beast that's going to throw them, that's going to tear their guts out. Let's go ahead
[23:06.120 --> 23:13.120]  and get into this article. Doctors condemn threatening Taser court ruling. Physicians
[23:13.600 --> 23:19.840]  speak out on bullying tactics of Taser International over its less than lethal weapons program.
[23:19.840 --> 23:25.200]  Let me read down here. This is what Jeffrey Jetson, and by the way I want him on the show,
[23:25.200 --> 23:29.760]  president of the National Association of Medical Examiners and the organization that represents
[23:29.760 --> 23:34.160]  the majority of medical examiners in the United States, has warned that the actions of Taser
[23:34.160 --> 23:40.120]  International and the court ruling have set a dangerous precedent. Our membership is very
[23:40.120 --> 23:46.040]  concerned about these cases. And the reaction of Taser to these cases, he said last night,
[23:46.040 --> 23:51.400]  our membership is looking into the area. Although Taser has developed its own opinion, there
[23:51.400 --> 23:56.600]  are certainly opposing opinions as to their involvement in causing sudden death in individuals.
[23:56.600 --> 24:02.200]  No, just thousands die right after being shocked by it. It's no big deal. Our organization
[24:02.200 --> 24:08.280]  feels that it violates the physician's ability to make a medical decision. Ordering a professional
[24:08.280 --> 24:13.400]  physician to change or alter their records is the violation of their right to practice
[24:13.400 --> 24:17.160]  medicine. Well, this isn't home of the free land of the brave anymore, Bob. You didn't
[24:17.160 --> 24:22.680]  get the memo. Taser has sued a number of medical examiners for making informed medical opinions
[24:22.680 --> 24:27.520]  in an attempt, I think, to both protect their product and send a threatening message to
[24:27.520 --> 24:32.840]  medical examiners. It is dangerously close to intimidation. Oh, you think so? He said
[24:32.840 --> 24:38.560]  they're attempting to send a message to medical examiners that they elect to make a determination
[24:38.560 --> 24:44.800]  that they may face a civil suit. And Taser International also cherry picks these. You
[24:44.800 --> 24:48.920]  know, they target medical examiners, they get them to just agree to change their filings
[24:48.920 --> 24:55.520]  and call it victories. But that's a separate issue from, I'm frankly not even against police
[24:55.520 --> 25:02.760]  having tasers. If they weren't told, I mean, I mean, every day I see 5, 10, 15 new videos
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.320]  where they'll have a guy in a jail cell and they'll say, okay, I want you to do a sobriety
[25:06.320 --> 25:11.920]  test. And the guy says no. So they taser them. Or here's one of an 84 year old man who was
[25:11.920 --> 25:17.960]  delirious from lack of oxygen dying. And it says that they tasered him repeatedly. This
[25:17.960 --> 25:28.040]  is the CBC. And they report it like it's completely normal and a good thing. I mean, I see this
[25:28.040 --> 25:32.160]  all the time or a pregnant lady just argues with the cop for five seconds about how fast
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.000]  she was driving or the famous footage of somebody, you know, gets out of the car and
[25:36.000 --> 25:41.280]  starts talking to the cops so they taser you. I read the Pentagon documents over a decade
[25:41.280 --> 25:45.320]  ago on less lethal weapons as they're truly called just like SWAT teams really aren't
[25:45.320 --> 25:48.800]  special weapons and tactics. They're special weapon attack teams. They just change the
[25:48.800 --> 25:57.960]  names. And I remember reading about this. I remember looking at how they said, well,
[25:57.960 --> 26:01.840]  actually, this will train the police to shoot the public. We want to have a militarized
[26:01.840 --> 26:07.600]  force. We want to control the population as we shift into this new non-freedom system,
[26:07.600 --> 26:12.200]  this global system. And so now these will be tools of compliance. I mean, remember hearing
[26:12.200 --> 26:16.200]  about third world prisons where they shock you with cattle prods or third world prisons
[26:16.200 --> 26:20.920]  where they shock you with 25,000 volt cattle prods? I mean, those are the average cattle
[26:20.920 --> 26:27.880]  prods, 25,000 volts. It just hurts. Oh no, we hit you with 50,000 and now 75,000 in the
[26:27.880 --> 26:34.200]  good old United States. And so these are all tools of compliance and more and more police,
[26:34.200 --> 26:40.160]  more and more control. Look at this man arrested for turning without signal. KVUE. This is
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.720]  Austin, Texas. Now, lest you think I cherry-picked to make the police look bad, I'm not even
[26:44.720 --> 26:48.640]  against the police. You're like the general public, scientifically brainwashed, scientifically
[26:48.640 --> 26:52.920]  conditioned incrementally to have an us against them mentality and to violate the Bill of
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.560]  Rights and Constitution. Man arrested for turning without signaling. I mean, this is
[26:57.560 --> 27:02.200]  just the last couple of days. I mean, I didn't even print all this off. I mean, I could make
[27:02.200 --> 27:07.280]  it look far worse. And it just said they pulled him over and they wanted to search his car,
[27:07.280 --> 27:10.400]  but he said, no, I have a right. And the guy said, okay, I'm going to arrest you for no
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.360]  turn signal. And the police said, yep, that's good. We now arrest you just like the woman
[27:14.360 --> 27:20.440]  in Lago Vista outside Austin, no criminal record admittedly at her mailbox, 50 yards
[27:20.440 --> 27:25.080]  from her house, the communal mailbox. She got out, took her seatbelt off, the cop admitted
[27:25.080 --> 27:29.760]  in trial. He saw her get out, take the belt off. He watched her. She got the mail, didn't
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.760]  put the seatbelt back on. He arrested her, her husband, a local anesthesiologist. I interviewed
[27:35.760 --> 27:39.680]  him and he came on the show for coming on the show. The police came to his house and
[27:39.680 --> 27:43.680]  said, you know why we're here? Shouldn't have gone on that show and beat him up right on
[27:43.680 --> 27:48.560]  his front porch and took him to jail. You don't go on Alex Jones' show. We're here to
[27:48.560 --> 27:54.520]  beat you now. You understand, boy? You and your wife keep your mouth shut. And I had
[27:54.520 --> 27:59.520]  the doctor. I know the doctor. He's bad too. Maybe we'll just have a judge tell him he's
[27:59.520 --> 28:03.720]  not allowed to come on the show. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm getting off another subject. That's just
[28:03.720 --> 28:08.600]  one of the big stack I have here and it got me into other things that happen. X cop, officers
[28:08.600 --> 28:12.800]  routinely lied to obtain search warrants at Lana Journal Constitution. Connecticut man
[28:12.800 --> 28:18.000]  says cops broke into his home and ripped out his catheter. Police admit they did. RCMP subdued
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.960]  hospitalized man 82 with Taser four times. Here's another one. Texas teen handcuffed
[28:23.960 --> 28:30.720]  wearing skippy dress to high school prom. Man walking bicycle gets jail time for DUI.
[28:30.720 --> 28:35.720]  President industry experience is boom. Bloomberg in run around the second amendment.
[28:35.720 --> 28:40.640]  Well, better ride back, ladies and gentlemen with some of your phone calls and a lot more
[28:40.640 --> 28:44.720]  than we'll get into the murder of Deborah Jean Palfrey. The ongoing cover up CNN covering

[29:02.960 --> 29:07.240]  the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate

[33:01.640 --> 33:08.640]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. It is the 11th day of May, 2008. I don't care of
[33:17.680 --> 33:24.680]  your Hispanic, black, white, Eskimo, Chinese. I want you to live in freedom. I want you
[33:25.640 --> 33:30.760]  to have a good life. I want our police to have a good life too. The problem is they're
[33:30.760 --> 33:37.760]  not our police anymore, and we all know that. This is not our government anymore. We're
[33:38.560 --> 33:45.640]  just like a third world country, more and more. Every telltale shine is there. And I
[33:45.640 --> 33:51.960]  just want to turn this around before it's too late. The federal government, the private
[33:51.960 --> 33:56.680]  corporations, the grants, the money, it's not enough for the government to ship in the
[33:56.680 --> 34:00.400]  majority of the narcotics who wander through their private banks. They got to put our
[34:00.400 --> 34:05.960]  kids in their private prisons. They got to have a war on drugs to keep the price up so
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.720]  they make larger profits. They got to bust down our doors in the middle of the night
[34:10.720 --> 34:17.220]  looking for what their boss has shipped in. While they push Ritalin and Prozac on 20%
[34:17.220 --> 34:22.760]  of our youth now on it, three years ago internal government and pharmaceutical documents came
[34:22.760 --> 34:28.680]  out in these new freedom initiative. When one of their own executives out of Pennsylvania
[34:28.680 --> 34:32.960]  went public and it said they plan to put half of American schoolchildren on psychotropic
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.480]  drugs and admitted it's all just a business and a fraud. The molecules of these drugs
[34:37.480 --> 34:42.560]  are much more dangerous, mind-altering and toxic to the body than classically illegal
[34:42.560 --> 34:48.280]  narcotics like heroin and cocaine. But it doesn't matter. They're still going to swat
[34:48.280 --> 34:51.640]  team you and they're still going to run checkpoints and they're still cops are still going to
[34:51.640 --> 34:56.000]  get killed fighting gangbangers who wouldn't exist if it wasn't for how much money there
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.440]  is in drugs. And the nightmare is just going to continue on and on and on. I said to be
[35:01.440 --> 35:07.920]  taking your calls. It's 877-590-5525 on any issue you want to discuss. Then later I want
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.800]  to talk about deadly cyclone puts terror hype in perspective. We pulled up some of the federal
[35:13.800 --> 35:19.360]  government's own numbers. You have a better chance of being killed by a deer in the United
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.400]  States. In fact, many times better chance than you do by a terrorist. You have thousands
[35:25.400 --> 35:30.000]  of times better chance of grounding or dying in an automobile accident. You have hundreds
[35:30.000 --> 35:35.560]  of times better chance of dying in a tornado. In fact, it's just hundreds and hundreds
[35:35.560 --> 35:42.160]  and hundreds down the list. That's averaging in the 3,911. It's like finding as I've joked
[35:42.160 --> 35:52.840]  a leprechaun nesting with a snuffalovagus hanging out with a reindeer with Santa Claus
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.800]  to actually find a real terrorist. But they sure hype it and the government occasionally
[35:56.800 --> 36:01.520]  sets off a pipe bomb here or there at their facilities and then frames some patch occasionally
[36:01.520 --> 36:06.520]  to, I mean, you know, trillions of dollars, fear mongering, running around with checkpoints.
[36:06.520 --> 36:09.600]  You try to go to Galveston. I don't go to that part of the coast anymore because you
[36:09.600 --> 36:13.280]  try to go across at Bolivar and they search your car and ask if you're a terrorist. All
[36:13.280 --> 36:18.440]  the borders are wide open. There's terrorists everywhere. Give your rights up. I mean, this
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.800]  is a sick joke. Deadly cyclone puts terror hype in perspective. So I thought I'd go
[36:23.800 --> 36:30.400]  over some of those numbers. It's now admitted to be right up at 29,000 dead and growing.
[36:30.400 --> 36:35.720]  They say he could rise into the hundreds of thousands as they continue to to find more
[36:35.720 --> 36:40.120]  dead bodies. They haven't even really begun that yet. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter
[36:40.120 --> 36:45.360]  of a tornado killed 20 something people last night in Oklahoma. It doesn't matter if you're
[36:45.360 --> 36:49.760]  going to give up all your freedoms. America is going to end and men in black uniforms
[36:49.760 --> 36:55.720]  and black masks are going to keep you safe from the summer. L CIA to bin Laden. That's
[36:55.720 --> 37:00.200]  coming up. CNN puts out a disinfo piece and covers info wars dot com and prison planet
[37:00.200 --> 37:05.080]  dot com. We got that for you. Tommy Chung says 9 11's an inside job. He's been rated
[37:05.080 --> 37:09.000]  for his political speech. Not only does the government tell medical examiners you can't
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.080]  in doctors that you can't say tasers cause heart attacks. And it doesn't matter. They're
[37:14.080 --> 37:18.480]  telling reporters they got to give up their sources now and they're telling courts that
[37:18.480 --> 37:22.800]  they can't say the second amendment's an individual right. There's a gag order on the second
[37:22.800 --> 37:30.200]  amendment. Not only is that going on, but we now have similar things in other areas
[37:30.200 --> 37:33.040]  that will also be breaking down. But right now let's take calls for the rest of this
[37:33.040 --> 37:36.480]  hour and then we'll cover all the rest of it coming up in the next hour. Let's see who's
[37:36.480 --> 37:43.840]  been holding the longest. Let's talk to S W in Iowa and as W you are on the air. Welcome
[37:43.840 --> 37:50.200]  Alex. The completion of the new order has to be submitted by this world's public. So
[37:50.200 --> 37:55.320]  common sense may come up with a list of five somewhat easy things that everybody like the
[37:55.320 --> 37:59.760]  average person can do to fight this N.W.O. when I was wondering if I could read them
[37:59.760 --> 38:04.920]  out to all of your listeners. Sure. What's your take on defeating the loving new world
[38:04.920 --> 38:11.800]  order? The what? Sir they do. They care about you, but go ahead. Make sarcastic folks. Go
[38:11.800 --> 38:16.760]  ahead. Number one is it's basic. It's turn off your television and that might sound easy,
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.280]  but subliminal messaging is highly addictive. Oh, that's that's taught in school that the
[38:20.280 --> 38:25.960]  average person doesn't know that that's real. Yes. And number two is educate yourself, your
[38:25.960 --> 38:31.280]  family, your friends on the facts. Information is easy and abundant to get. Number three
[38:31.280 --> 38:35.320]  is understand that the monetary system is an illusion. Spend your money on necessities
[38:35.320 --> 38:40.920]  and avoid one good. Number four is have at least a year's food and water supply. E only
[38:40.920 --> 38:45.640]  foods that come from the earth in our aren't genetically modified. Oh, no. Doesn't matter
[38:45.640 --> 38:51.000]  of with the mainline GMO potatoes, GMO corn and GMO tomatoes that all the rats that eat
[38:51.000 --> 38:56.680]  it die. It's nutritious. Having one in three with diabetes, one in three cancer from one
[38:56.680 --> 39:04.480]  in 33 with cancer before is good. Sir, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Also drink pure water without
[39:04.480 --> 39:08.760]  pharmaceutical drugs in that that does not contain sodium fluoride. We'll just have
[39:08.760 --> 39:14.840]  to have a judge rule. You can't say sodium fluoride or drugs in the water is bad, sir.
[39:14.840 --> 39:19.600]  And also the Illuminati has a strong hold on the gambling, alcohol and tobacco industry.
[39:19.600 --> 39:25.160]  So you want to avoid those. I agree. And number five is own guns and back your rights with
[39:25.160 --> 39:29.880]  your life. Good to hear from you. Anything else? Also, I just want to throw in number
[39:29.880 --> 39:34.840]  six, be a better parent because 99% of every problem that you can think of in this world
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.680]  comes back to bad parenting. Well, I agree with you and not caring about your family
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.560]  and instead chasing after some bobble. Now, now let's go back and I'm not saying don't
[39:44.560 --> 39:50.080]  chase bobbles, but family comes first, being secure and in place comes first and not being
[39:50.080 --> 39:55.680]  under Madison Avenue's control comes first. Then in the hierarchy of news, in the hierarchy
[39:55.680 --> 40:00.560]  of needs, you can have the other things. Go back to your second question. What was it?
[40:00.560 --> 40:06.800]  Mark, second point about like education or read your points again, because what happens
[40:06.800 --> 40:12.080]  is I always interrupt because I get so hyped up. If I don't interrupt this interruption
[40:12.080 --> 40:18.280]  brought to you by CW Hammond. No, that's a joke to my uncle out there. If I don't interrupt,
[40:18.280 --> 40:22.320]  you see that I forget the point I wanted to make. Go back to your first couple of points
[40:22.320 --> 40:27.800]  like, like just like a list of five. Yes, sir. The list of five. It's turn off the TV,
[40:27.800 --> 40:31.640]  say yourself on the, on the true facts, understand that the monetary system is an illusion.
[40:31.640 --> 40:36.120]  Oh, yes. That was the point. I appreciate your call. Yes. Um, because I kind of babbled
[40:36.120 --> 40:40.000]  that out and it wouldn't make sense to somebody listening where I said, yes, they teach it
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.600]  in school, but the general public doesn't know it. And what I properly should have said
[40:45.600 --> 40:52.640]  is in a basic college level marketing class in your first year of radio, television and
[40:52.640 --> 40:56.840]  film, at least for me. And then I've seen some other textbooks and curriculum and found
[40:56.840 --> 41:03.800]  it's also in those, but, but, but most RTF schooling teaches you that they have had subliminals
[41:03.800 --> 41:09.040]  for at least 70 years in the United States and Europe. And of course, in the fifties,
[41:09.040 --> 41:14.960]  they would show for a split second, uh, during the trailers, a Coca-Cola, uh, interspersed
[41:14.960 --> 41:21.920]  with a desert and they found that it boosted sales of Coke 50%. And that was in, uh, the,
[41:21.920 --> 41:28.080]  uh, was it late forties actually? And then it really went wide scale by the fifties.
[41:28.080 --> 41:33.360]  And so yes, there is subliminal messaging everywhere. It is all over the place. Here's
[41:33.360 --> 41:38.280]  an example of subliminals. Okay. There's different classes of it, different areas of it. And,
[41:38.280 --> 41:45.440]  uh, it's, it's very widespread and there's so many different forms of it. But here's
[41:45.440 --> 41:51.520]  one when you're watching CNN and you see like six or eight different TV screens all right
[41:51.520 --> 41:56.840]  up against each other with different video feeds, different images on the back. That
[41:56.840 --> 42:02.480]  is meant to switch off your conscious mind because only your subconscious, this is in
[42:02.480 --> 42:05.760]  textbooks. This is a, this was discovered decades ago and this is why you see it almost
[42:05.760 --> 42:13.560]  television. They have those different TV screens behind you because your mind then goes into
[42:13.560 --> 42:19.240]  a subconscious mode to be able to gather all that info. And now you're not critically
[42:19.240 --> 42:25.000]  assessing the main data stream of what the host is saying. You have the scroll at the
[42:25.000 --> 42:31.280]  bottom. That's a seven through eight feed. Then they'll have some moving, swirling myths.
[42:31.280 --> 42:38.600]  That's a ninth. Then there's the flicker rate of the television designed by the Pentagon
[42:38.600 --> 42:45.120]  more than 40 years ago to mesmerize you at the exact frequency. All declassified Pentagon
[42:45.120 --> 42:53.640]  war attack against you. We'll be right back. The cancer viruses are in your back seats.

[44:54.040 --> 44:58.320]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you
[44:58.320 --> 45:02.280]  have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the
[45:02.280 --> 45:06.840]  water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[45:06.840 --> 45:12.080]  into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.560]  designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria,
[45:17.560 --> 45:23.280]  mold, algae and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons
[45:23.280 --> 45:27.760]  or one year whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities
[45:27.760 --> 45:32.680]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you? Order

[47:05.840 --> 47:09.920]  You know, if you're a new listener driving along, listening to us in the middle of the country,
[47:09.920 --> 47:16.480]  or right here in Austin, Texas, or in Florida, in Iowa, wherever you're listening,
[47:17.120 --> 47:20.400]  listening on Global Swartwaven Africa, we get letters from there,
[47:21.120 --> 47:29.360]  China, the internet, in Japan or Germany. Don't believe me, just go research the flicker rate
[47:29.360 --> 47:36.240]  of television sets. You know, I thought they'd honed all this down, but a few years ago, my friend,
[47:36.240 --> 47:46.880]  who is, let's just say, a high-level technocrat in the UT Psychology Department University of Texas
[47:46.880 --> 47:54.320]  here in Austin, said, hey, Alex, I want to give you a tour of the unclassified areas of the new
[47:54.320 --> 48:01.360]  psychology building. And he showed me several floors, and most of the labs were paid for by DARPA,
[48:01.360 --> 48:06.240]  which say on the door that the folks that, you know, basically built the infrastructure that we
[48:06.240 --> 48:14.240]  live under, built the internet, MIT is their main hub, and it was all the flicker rate with
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.680]  hooked into monkeys' brains who were actually across town and then out at the monkey lab out
[48:19.680 --> 48:26.160]  in Bastrop, but you could look at the monkeys over camera feeds. But they're humane. I mean,
[48:26.160 --> 48:29.840]  they only hooked the wires in their brains for, you know, a few weeks and then they kill them.
[48:29.840 --> 48:36.560]  It's a loving, loving situation. But I mean, the argument isn't about the killing the monkeys.
[48:36.560 --> 48:41.280]  The point is, is that they're there testing flicker rate on how to mesmerize a primate.
[48:41.840 --> 48:46.320]  And then they have labs next door to it where they then have humans come in, and it's just all
[48:46.320 --> 48:54.880]  the government pays UT. See, universities now, the sports clubs and the dormitories and the schooling
[48:54.880 --> 49:02.800]  is a very small part of UT. I mean, it's maybe 8%, 9% of the overall thing. The rest is investments
[49:02.800 --> 49:08.880]  and owning radio networks and sports teams and telecommunications and oil fields and getting
[49:08.880 --> 49:16.480]  tax money. These are businesses. And the whole world's run like that. And the Pentagon runs
[49:17.040 --> 49:23.040]  90 plus percent of all of your peer research at universities, and it's all how to dominate and
[49:23.040 --> 49:28.880]  control us. You think these powerful people are going to stop trying to take over foreign countries?
[49:28.880 --> 49:36.240]  No, no, you're the big target. You're the big prize. So don't just say, oh, Alex says the
[49:36.240 --> 49:43.600]  television is mesmerizing us. It's an absolute fact that they flicker it at a rate and that they
[49:43.600 --> 49:51.200]  have the televisions designed for that rate to bring you into a dreamlike state. I mean,
[49:51.200 --> 49:57.840]  it is a fact that within minutes you go into a dream brainwave when watching television. That
[49:57.840 --> 50:03.200]  is an absolute fact. And see, I want you to not believe me. I want you to go find that out for
[50:03.200 --> 50:08.560]  yourself, Google it for yourself, or, you know, get a history of television book. Hundreds have
[50:08.560 --> 50:14.400]  been written. And then just find out that's your controllers. That's your friendly masters. That's
[50:14.400 --> 50:20.000]  the behavioral psychologist and psychiatrist that have shaped your world. Go read a book by the
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.720]  father of modern advertising, Edward Bernays, where he calls you a dumb slave and admits they run your
[50:24.720 --> 50:31.280]  whole life. I've read both his major books. One of them is called Propaganda. Edward Bernays.
[50:33.200 --> 50:38.320]  And he says that you're a slave and that you're an idiot. And he says, he says the public won't
[50:38.320 --> 50:43.920]  even read my book and laugh at you. Okay. He's the reason you eat bacon and eggs. He's the reason
[50:43.920 --> 50:50.960]  women smoke cigarettes. That's just one guy. See, and I have to sit here and watch them. I mean,
[50:50.960 --> 50:57.280]  Hollywood paid back in the 70s to have the TV show SWAT and to advertise it. And they show you
[50:57.280 --> 51:01.920]  guys in black uniforms everywhere. Those are attack teams to take you to FEMA camps, folks.
[51:01.920 --> 51:05.760]  They just drill them and train them in the name of the drug war. Now they're moving that to the
[51:05.760 --> 51:10.640]  terror war. It's always a new war. And of course, the poor guys in black masks, they don't know that.
[51:10.640 --> 51:16.560]  You know, I said, I take your calls and I haven't done that really properly. So I'm going to just
[51:16.560 --> 51:22.560]  race through them because we're calling Arizona, New York, Texas, Florida, everywhere. Let's go
[51:22.560 --> 51:30.320]  ahead here and talk to Robert in Arizona. You're on the air. Hello, Alex. Hi. My father was in
[51:30.320 --> 51:34.880]  law enforcement. And, you know, when you're talking about using deadly force, you only use it when
[51:34.880 --> 51:40.080]  you have to protect. But the tasers aren't deadly. All these people dying. It just, it's an accident
[51:40.080 --> 51:45.520]  that happens when they're tasered. It has nothing to do with that, sir. You've heard the judge.
[51:45.520 --> 51:48.720]  The judge has told doctors they're not allowed to say it's killing people.
[51:50.240 --> 51:53.760]  And the judge is saying you're not allowed to have the Second Amendment in court. Here,
[51:53.760 --> 51:58.240]  let me read from the New York Sun. And then I'm going to let you talk. It says,
[51:58.240 --> 52:02.480]  it says, if you can't discuss the bill of rights in a court of law, where should we discuss it?
[52:03.440 --> 52:06.400]  In a tavern? You understand, sir? Go ahead.
[52:06.400 --> 52:13.120]  Well, you know, there was a tavern in Pennsylvania where people discuss certain things at Concord,
[52:13.120 --> 52:18.880]  not the Green Dragon. Those were terrorists. I have FEMA on video teaching police that the
[52:18.880 --> 52:22.960]  founders at the Green Dragon were terrorists. Are you with those terrorists? Are you with them?
[52:22.960 --> 52:26.880]  By the way, listeners, I'm not joking. FEMA's standard deal. The founding fathers are bad.
[52:26.880 --> 52:31.920]  I'm sorry. Go ahead and tell me about the terrorist. There's two things I want to mention. So let's
[52:31.920 --> 52:37.360]  please stay on track today and take a deep breath, Alex. This interruption brought to you by
[52:37.360 --> 52:45.120]  infowars.com. Here, go ahead. All right. The point is, is a taser is something you would use
[52:45.120 --> 52:50.560]  to protect your life when you don't have to go for your gun. And you know, the person might have
[52:50.560 --> 52:56.320]  a knife or they might have a club or something. You know, there's very low chance that you're
[52:56.320 --> 53:03.040]  going to die. So you use a taser. It's the threat escalation continuum. And then if somebody's got
[53:03.040 --> 53:08.560]  a club and you should first meet them with a taser, that's how it was sold. But now,
[53:08.560 --> 53:14.880]  if an old lady won't get out of a wheelchair, go ahead. Well, we're going to need to have the courts
[53:14.880 --> 53:18.480]  to sort this out. That's the only answer. The courts are bought and paid for. Go ahead.
[53:19.440 --> 53:24.400]  Well, we need juries and courts to sort this out. And we're going to, it's going to take more
[53:24.400 --> 53:29.520]  education, more fully informed jurors, laying down the law. And that's the only way we're
[53:29.520 --> 53:35.360]  going to get around that. But the other thing I wanted to promote is, you know, as well as I,
[53:35.360 --> 53:42.000]  that the oil for arms for drugs economy that we have now, yeah, mercantilism, almost,
[53:42.000 --> 53:48.640]  it's almost a mirror image of the old T for silver for opium economy that the British Empire ran.
[53:48.640 --> 53:55.360]  Yep. Mercantile triangular. Yep. It's absolutely a mercantilist mechanism that benefits the select
[53:55.360 --> 54:01.120]  That's kind of fancy talk there. Maybe you're with Alcada. You know about history. That's
[54:01.120 --> 54:08.560]  a terrorist. Well, I have a solution for it. We know that educating people about the insane war
[54:08.560 --> 54:14.800]  on some drugs is part of the answer. But there's another aspect to this that few people know
[54:14.800 --> 54:20.800]  about. And I would hardly encourage you to get David Blum on the author of alcohol can be a gas
[54:21.360 --> 54:28.000]  because he has information that few people have. And it is possible that we could turn our backs
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.200]  on imported oil completely. Oh, I know, I know. And I, I appreciate your call. Great call, sir.
[54:34.320 --> 54:38.560]  All right. This interruption brought to you by prisonplanet.com. I'm just joking. I was joking
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.960]  to my uncle this weekend. I said, I'll start on air saying this interruption brought to you by,
[54:42.960 --> 54:50.960]  hey, let's go ahead now and take another call. Let's go ahead and talk to Aaron in New York.
[54:50.960 --> 54:56.800]  Is that New York, New York or New York? Hello? Yes, commander. Hey, what's up? Yeah, I'm in
[54:56.800 --> 55:03.520]  upstate New York. Oh, that's where the founding terrorist came from. Anyways, go ahead. Those
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.560]  evil terrorists go ahead. Thanks for everything you do for us, man. Yeah. And you're so funny,
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.240]  man. Just like I was in your show every day at work. I'm just like, I love it. I learned so
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.880]  much about the economy. Well, we gotta laugh while we go down on the Titanic, you know? Yeah, I know
[55:16.880 --> 55:22.960]  it's like, it's some saying like how, some, I don't know, about how you gotta laugh at everything.
[55:22.960 --> 55:30.400]  Laugh at your impending doom, yes. Yeah. Well, I was looking at like the Fortune 500 companies,
[55:30.960 --> 55:36.320]  like the global ones. And just looking at that list, man, like they're all around, like you,
[55:36.320 --> 55:41.840]  even since I was little, like you got like a Mattel on there, like everything, you know, and
[55:41.840 --> 55:46.240]  like just from listening to your show, I've just been waking up. I feel like that guy in 1984, you
[55:46.240 --> 55:50.560]  know? And it's only a few hundred companies. That's why every toy, they're no longer is at
[55:50.560 --> 55:56.800]  US troops for at least 10 years. It's all UN, global force. Again, I mean, anybody who questions
[55:56.800 --> 56:02.080]  that they've got everything under control and have a propaganda web, look at how all the toy
[56:02.080 --> 56:09.360]  manufacturers only show UN toys. Yeah. It doesn't matter if it's Playmobil from Germany or Mattel
[56:09.360 --> 56:14.720]  from the US. It's all the same brainwashing. I was, I worked at a school on my gender and I
[56:14.720 --> 56:20.480]  felt like instead of like having the toy soldiers, now they have like little cops with like bull horns
[56:20.480 --> 56:26.640]  and like guns and stuff. Oh, they have all these martial law toys now. And the toy cops have like
[56:26.640 --> 56:30.880]  mean, hateful looks on their face and little black scheme mask you put on them. Oh yeah.
[56:30.880 --> 56:36.720]  He's like yelling. It's crazy, man. I work in elementary school. They got like the dare program
[56:36.720 --> 56:41.840]  and all that. Which they, which they admit has caused an increase in drug use. Everybody, in fact,
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.400]  Trey, turn your mic on. Hey, I appreciate your call. I'm going to bring Trey who also produces
[56:46.400 --> 56:51.840]  my weekday show. Then he ends up board hopping on Sundays. Hey, Trey, you talk about how you had never
[56:52.480 --> 56:57.840]  seen drugs until they came in and advertised them in Houston. I didn't know what cocaine or acid
[56:57.840 --> 57:03.280]  or I didn't even know what marijuana looked like. I had no clue. And I never even saw those drugs
[57:03.280 --> 57:07.920]  again until maybe five years later in my life. So it was weird. And did it make you want to
[57:07.920 --> 57:15.120]  experiment seeing them? Honestly, no. It made me kind of want to stay away from it, but
[57:15.840 --> 57:19.440]  well, then it's good. It sparked my imagination. That's why drug use has increased triple the
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.600]  arrow and double the cocaine, you know, millions in prison. Yeah, I did teach me stuff that I
[57:23.600 --> 57:28.640]  shouldn't know. Well, here's what we know with the studies. Okay, take death education,
[57:28.640 --> 57:34.800]  suicide education. The fed started in the early 90s. Suicide is exploded among teens because
[57:34.800 --> 57:38.160]  they never thought about it. Now, now when you're depressed, they think, oh, you're supposed to
[57:38.160 --> 57:43.520]  commit suicide. Just like they know that sex education actually increases sexual promise.

[58:49.760 --> 58:56.160]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg group. Could their
[58:56.160 --> 59:02.960]  objective be world domination? For thousands of years their dark order grew. Now as they hail the
[59:02.960 --> 59:09.120]  birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.000 --> 59:17.440]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:17.440 --> 59:21.280]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[59:21.280 --> 59:25.040]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[59:25.040 --> 59:28.240]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. Yes,

[1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:20.240]  you know, firefighters rescue personnel go out house to house to look around and they think
[1:00:20.240 --> 1:00:25.680]  they've found all the injured or fatalities. In a British aid group says the lives of up to
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:30.720]  one and a half million cyclone victims are in danger from disease of clean water and sanitation
[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:36.320]  are not provided soon to Myanmar. Burmese exile leader so long says Myanmar have felled in the
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:44.880]  past to distribute aid properly. What they have is the highly corrupted officials using their power
[1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:52.640]  to abuse and to make reach out of it. This is IRN USA Radio News. It's skin cancer awareness month
[1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:57.200]  and the Skin Cancer Foundation and Avino are traveling cross-country in a 38-foot RV offering
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:01.600]  free full-body skin cancer screenings from local dermatologists that have donated their time.
[1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:05.840]  Dermatologist Dr. Janine Downey. Well skin cancer is the most common form of cancer
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:10.560]  diagnosed in the United States, also of the most preventable and the most curable form of its
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:15.280]  diagnosed early. There's over a million cases that are diagnosed each year. What else? Wearing
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:20.320]  sunblock with at least SPF of 15 or higher every day all year round regardless of the color of your
[1:01:20.320 --> 1:01:27.520]  skin. Everybody should just take a quick peek when you're getting into the shower. I want people to
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:31.760]  look for sunscreens that have photo stabilizing technology like those that available in the
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:36.640]  Avino continuous protection line that offers UVA protection which protects you against premature
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:42.400]  aging and UVB is responsible for skin cancers and immediate burning. So this unique blend

[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:59.520]  today. She's spending Mother's Day in West Virginia. rival Barack Obama who is now a
[1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:04.960]  race to Clinton's super delegate lead has no public event scheduled. Republican John McCain
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:10.000]  is taking the day off too. Obama says the fall campaign will be more about specific plans than
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  who is more liberal or more conservative. I think it's going to have to do with who has a plan to
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.840]  provide relief to people when it comes to their gas prices. Who has a real plan to make sure that
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:26.240]  everybody has health insurance. Who's got a real plan to deal with college affordability. Who can
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:31.360]  help American families live out their dreams. And the upper peninsula town of calm at Michigan has
[1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:37.520]  an extra 20 bucks in the bank from an old unpaid parking ticket police had long ago forgotten about.
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:42.880]  The $1 ticket a $20 bill and a note arrived at the police headquarters from an anonymous woman
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:49.760]  who got the ticket in 1976. For more news and analysis log on to irnews.com
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:27.200]  Expect to see at least one official White House photo today of Jenna Bush's wedding last night.
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:32.480]  President Bush's daughter and her longtime beau Henry Hager got married at the Bush family ranch
[1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:38.000]  in Texas. President and Mrs. Bush also plan to give reporters an account of the celebration
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:43.680]  which was off limits to the media. Here's Mark Smith. The last rays of the sun slanted across
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:48.960]  the manmade lake as the bride and groom said their vows in front of the limestone cross.
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:54.800]  One of those present reports Jenna's grandparents former president Bush and his wife Barbara spoke.
[1:03:54.800 --> 1:04:01.040]  The bride wore an Oscar De Laurent address but no veil the groom of blue suit with a pale blue tie.
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:06.560]  The woman credited with creating Mother's Day 100 years ago suggested giving mom a single white
[1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:12.880]  carnation to signify the purity of a mother's love. Anna Jarvis' idea has turned into one of
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:18.880]  the world's most celebrated holidays and one of the most expensive with an estimated $15
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:25.440]  billion in spending on moms in the U.S. The New York resident says he really admires his mom.
[1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:30.640]  She was a special person since she had that special head quality. She's bright and insightful.
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:35.760]  And police in Lawton, Oklahoma say there's been an accidental shooting involving a five-year-old
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:42.480]  boy and a three-year-old girl. The boy found a 45-caliber handgun in his home, thought it was a
[1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:48.880]  toy, and wounded the girl in the leg. I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:58.480]  Radio Network. It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[1:04:58.480 --> 1:05:06.000]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination? For thousands
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:12.640]  of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream

[1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:02.720]  Okay, here's the deal. I'm going to go to your calls. I love the grab bag effect, the wheel of
[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:07.600]  fortune. Spin the wheel. Who knows what's coming out of the box. All you great listeners call them.
[1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:14.000]  We really appreciate it. But bottom line, everybody in the government, everybody outside the
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:18.560]  government, for people in the corporate structure, for people who've got their own private businesses,
[1:06:18.560 --> 1:06:24.240]  you aren't in the corporate structure, we're all in this together unless you're just a few
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:30.320]  thousand globalists. And I say that we need to get hardcore and get serious and get focused
[1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:35.120]  about our liberties and freedoms until anybody that tries to push us around or take our liberties,
[1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:41.120]  that there's no more Mr. Nice Guy. That's what I told you last week. Coming up after some phone
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:48.000]  calls, singing in tries to debunk prisonplanet.com. That's right, we'll be debunking them.
[1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:54.720]  That's what they said to Debra Jean Palfrey when they whacked her.
[1:06:55.920 --> 1:07:03.040]  Well, we're not going to go along with this. Also, Tommy Chong on the radio show Friday,
[1:07:03.040 --> 1:07:09.600]  I interviewed him from Port Aransas, Funky Redneckville, enjoying myself in my element down there.
[1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:12.960]  Didn't drink any beer. No.
[1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:18.400]  No, I was just down there. It was great. All right, I'm already starting to have
[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:22.240]  flashbacks to not working, which is a real rarity to even take off two, three days.
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:27.440]  Let's go to your phone calls right now. Let's talk to George in Florida.
[1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:34.320]  Welcome, sir. Thank you for holding. Thank you, Alex. I wish your wife a happy Mother's Day,
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:38.480]  because I know when you really start engaging in New World Order, it's going to be our wives
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:43.840]  and our mothers are going to keep the family together. Absolutely. Yes, I read a- Hey,
[1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:50.560]  old big mama. All the big mamas out there. Go ahead. Yes, I was monitoring the candidates
[1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:54.800]  running for sheriff in my county, and we got this candidate for sheriff. He's talking about
[1:07:54.800 --> 1:08:00.240]  a- If he becomes sheriff, he's going to do a sort of policing, and he was bragging about
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:04.560]  the counties that use this as sort of policing. And he was saying all crime is terror. Listen,
[1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:12.960]  type into Google, thousands of cases or Patriot Act used in non-terror, and let me think of
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:15.680]  the exact headline, because there's so many headlines. We're going to give you one,
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:20.800]  so somebody Googles it. You'll find it on the first Google search. Patriot Act used in non-terror
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:26.320]  cases, and they use them for marijuana. They use them for speeding. They use it for everything now.
[1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:34.080]  And yeah, a sort of means martial law, pulling you over randomly. No bill of rights, no due
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:40.800]  process, literally treating us like the slaves we are. Go ahead. Yes, and even says the sheriff's
[1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:45.440]  office is a paramilitary organization. Well, they are. They work for the banks, and they own us.
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:50.640]  They do. And I just- They're just now getting around to telling them. I'm not joking, listeners,
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:56.400]  by the way, the globalist claim ownership of us. Go ahead. Yes, and I gotta say, I read the sheriff's
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:01.120]  charter and it talks nothing about it being a paramilitary organization. I know. In fact,
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:06.480]  they are elected by the people, and they serve under the state constitution and bill of rights.
[1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:14.800]  Can I make one more? They are servants, not officials or authorities, or all these got- Listen,
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:20.480]  it's simple. Either they're servants or they're our bosses. You see, you notice how- I had an
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:24.160]  Austin cop one time when they were running checkpoints, and I came up to him and said,
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:27.760]  you shouldn't be doing this. And I said, you know, you're a public servant. You shouldn't be so smart
[1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:33.520]  mouth. And he said, I pay my own salary. I pay taxes too. I don't work for you. Sorry, go ahead.
[1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:38.240]  So see, but as soon as they don't work for you, baby, you be working for them. Go ahead. That's
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:44.000]  how it is in every other third world country. Go ahead. Yes, as a- as a satisfied prison
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:49.200]  planet customer, I pulled up all your videos and burned them from the Hurricane Katrina,
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:53.600]  and I passed them out to the deputies in my county. And I'll tell you one thing, got a very positive
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:59.040]  response. Oh, really? What did they say? They said, we never do that. And I pulled up the AP
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:03.600]  articles printed them out and passed it to them. I said, there it is. There's the evidence. And then
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:09.280]  they heard rumors from some New Orleans cops who are on our sheriff's department tell them, yep,
[1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:13.520]  this is- he's right. No, no, there's no rumors. We have their own training manuals when they were
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:18.640]  secret, now declassified. Every police force has been trained for martial law. Every police force
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:22.720]  has been trained to take your children. I'm not joking, listeners. I'm actually risking my life
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:27.120]  doing this. I just- I joke around because I gotta, you know, stay positive or I couldn't do it. I
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:32.960]  appreciate your call. All right. Thank you, Alex. You bet. Thank you, my friend. Let me explain
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:40.160]  something to- to everybody out there, okay? The government has gone rogue. It's the- the country
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:46.960]  is owned by foreign banks. Just like China was controlled by 10 Western powers, and they broke
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:53.040]  it up in 10 parts, and they just raped the people, sucked everything out of them, totally controlled
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:58.880]  them. That's how the U.S. is seen now, okay? Just like third-world countries have been dominated by
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:03.840]  us or by the big banks that are in the U.S., we're now gonna be just like that. You understand?
[1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:10.240]  I mean, 50 years ago, they were wearing black ski mask in Mexico. Their paramilitary police in
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:16.880]  every city were called the Foxes. Translate that into Spanish. Uh, 60, 70 years ago in Chile,
[1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:23.520]  they had cops in black mask. They had police in black mask 600 years ago in Spain. They had police
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:30.000]  in black mask a thousand years ago. What do you think the sheriff, the Lord High Sheriff, and his
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.920]  boys wore when they came to grab you at the middle of the night and take you off to kill you?
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:39.600]  If you even spoke out against them, I mean, you know, Robin Hood, a cute guy in green tights,
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:43.280]  that's not what really happened with the true story. You ought to go read the true story of
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.320]  that. The police were riding around in black mask, raping and stealing and doing whatever they
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:54.080]  wanted until the people started killing them right back, okay? That's what the story of Robin Hood is,
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.560]  okay? So, so, you know, this is the type of real stuff that's going on out there.
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:07.120]  Oh my gosh, I'm really off the beaten trail now, okay? And, but the point is the new
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:11.120]  old order doesn't care. I don't want any cops to get hurt. The new old order wants their cops to
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:17.600]  get hurt. Here's an example. Go pull the numbers and it depends on year to year because the numbers
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:24.560]  vary greatly, but always more police are killed in traffic accidents than killed by guns or killed
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:29.840]  by knives than are killed, you know, by being attacked by somebody. And in some cases, it's 10
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:34.800]  plus times. Some years it's only three times, but you can go pull those numbers if you'd like,
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:37.920]  but we have a detailed report. We're gonna come back and take more calls, but let me just cover
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:42.880]  this now. Deadly Cyclone puts terror hype in perspective and Paul Watson wrote this for
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:47.840]  PrisonPlanet.com. It's in the news and focus section on the right hand side. You can see a link to it,
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:53.360]  but don't believe us. We have links in the federal government's own, own, own statistics here,
[1:12:53.360 --> 1:12:57.360]  okay? Everything we do is documented. Now,
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:03.920]  they admit here you have a many times better chance of a deer jumping out in front of you and
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:08.320]  being killed by the wreck it causes. You have a many times better chance of dying from grounding.
[1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:12.880]  You have a many times better chance of falling and hitting your head. I don't care how old you are,
[1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:17.200]  okay? You have a many times better chance of being struck by lightning. But, but
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:22.320]  our whole life, everything we do, I mean, they're now having all over the country where they make
[1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:26.400]  kids put their hands behind their heads and march out of the schools for a terror attack or mass
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:31.360]  shooting, but I have the numbers. Did you know statistically more children die each year in
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:38.240]  football accidents than die in school shootings? Google that mainstream news. You'll find it.
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:43.360]  Oh yeah. More than 10 kids on average every year die in football, but they keep it real quiet.
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:50.400]  Am I saying go ban football? I was thinking about it today. I was driving down I-35 from the Texas
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:55.840]  coast, you know, coming back from I-37. I was going 70 miles an hour. There were 18 wheelers
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:14:01.280]  going by me going 75. There were idiot drivers. It was so deadly. I had my babies behind me in
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:06.400]  their car seats. I was risking their lives. This was the number one cause of death. I mean,
[1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:13.040]  sudden death was all around me. Huge 18 wheelers. Every week when you're out driving, you end up
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:17.120]  driving by some fatality accident. How many times have you driven by when there's blood all over
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.000]  the ground and stretchers, but you still get in your car, start it, put your kids in the car and
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:29.200]  go out like Frogger and are hurtling along in these 10 cans at 70, 80 miles an hour. Kills hundreds
[1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:35.680]  of thousands each year, but you do it. Just like cops now when they come up to your car shaking,
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.320]  they're afraid. They got their guns out. They got them so afraid of guns and being killed and oh my
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:46.320]  gosh, it wasn't that cops didn't have good training 20 years ago. They just weren't cowards. Every
[1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:51.760]  time there was a mass shooting, the cops would rush in University of Texas Tower with citizens.
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:58.080]  Now called civilians and they went up and killed that guy. Now if citizens pulled rifles out for
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:03.200]  shooting back, the cops would kill them. Guaranteed. I'm going to come back and give you more of these
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:09.280]  numbers and explain things and break things down of how the government has become an us against
[1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:13.760]  them mentality and literally wages war against us. And I'm going to give you some official government
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:19.200]  documents where they say they're going to get our guns. We'll be right back after this quick break
[1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:25.040]  and we'll also be taking your phone calls. By the way, I'll be showing my new film,
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:31.840]  The Alamo Draft House Ritz on Sixth Street this next Saturday and Sunday. And I'm only showing
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:37.920]  it twice, ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com for details for Central Texas listeners.
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:43.120]  This is the most amazing film I've ever made. Each one just gets better infowars.com. We'll be right
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:55.760]  back. Greetings. I am Dr. Bill Von Sheik with the White Paper Comicles. Mr. Steve Sheik with
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:01.520]  his Fearless Radio program is correct when he says the solution to our difficult times is to store
[1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:07.520]  food and get healthy. My comrades and I of the media don't want you to panic. We, unlike Fearless
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:13.040]  Radio, try not to tell you about the food control legislation. Hurricane Katrina, the American
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:18.240]  famine, families unable to buy food. If we told you that solution to all these problems,
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:23.840]  this food, you'd panic and run out and buy a food before it disappeared or you couldn't afford it.
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:29.280]  You'd completely mess up the perfect strategy for population control and they'd kick us out of the
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:35.760]  Survivors Club. You are a sissy chicken if you call JMSEfoodsDirect.com and order food.
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:45.760]  This is Steve. Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633. You'll be considered
[1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:51.760]  a little bit crazy, but there's no such thing as a little bit dead. Now from the makers of Loose
[1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:56.640]  Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes the long-awaited release of Loose

[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:11.760]  in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:16.880]  of the horrendous crime are brought to justice. Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:21.760]  expose. From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings,

[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:48.560]  information war. Truth is our weapon and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:54.160]  to Big Brother. The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government
[1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:59.840]  debt. But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:07.440]  a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years. The
[1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:12.240]  U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:18.400]  the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%. It's bad enough
[1:18:18.400 --> 1:18:23.360]  that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce. However, shocking the economy
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:28.320]  with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:34.720]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts. Call 1-800-686-2237
[1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:39.600]  for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt. You must understand
[1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:46.000]  how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt. Call 1-800-686-2237. That's
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:54.480]  1-800-686-2237. I used to be ashamed of my toenails. I thought I was destined to wear socks
[1:18:54.480 --> 1:18:59.200]  and tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes in the sand at the beach. But
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:05.440]  then I heard about non-x nail gel. It tackles the problem of unsightly nails by clearing out the
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:12.240]  cause of the problem, yellowing keratin debris buildup. With regular use, non-x gel breaks down
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:18.320]  and removes this debris so nails look clear. I confess I was skeptical in the beginning,
[1:19:18.320 --> 1:19:24.480]  but I stuck with it using non-x gel twice daily. Actually, I was surprised how generously sized
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:30.960]  the bottle is and how long it lasts. A while ago, you could look at my nails and, well,
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:36.960]  glance away, but not anymore. Now my toenails look better than ever, and I'm wearing sandals
[1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:44.400]  again, thanks to a simple natural gel. If your toenails are an embarrassment, try non-x nail gel.
[1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:49.120]  It's available in the foot care aisle of your drugstore, mass retailer, or super center.
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:57.520]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:05.840]  Yeah, I'm going to go write your calls, but I wanted to make the point that, yes,
[1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:12.080]  I'm having two showings of my newest documentary, 9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising, part one,
[1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:20.400]  and it's amazing. It's cinema verite. My other documentaries have a lot of great footage
[1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:26.000]  and interviews and things, but also a lot of documentation. This is just activism, confrontations.
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:31.840]  It's really just amazing. Go to infowars.com. We live in Central Texas. Link through. I'll
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:37.680]  give a speech for 30 minutes. Forehand next Saturday, downtown, the Alamo Ritz for 30 minutes,
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:41.440]  then show the two-hour film, and the next Sunday, so I can do the Sunday show live,
[1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:47.840]  then I'll go down, and it's from, it's 630s when it starts, next Sunday. So next Saturday and Sunday,
[1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:52.960]  Alamo Graftow Cinema in downtown Austin on 6th Street. Their new and newest theater,
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:21:00.640]  nicest theater, it is known as the Ritz. Okay. Yeah, my point is, is that police are told,
[1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:04.720]  you've got to swat team them. You've got to keep on top of the public. You've got to take
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:08.960]  their rights for their own good. You've got to guard the public. They're a bunch of idiots,
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:14.560]  which in a way is true, but so are the police and this brainwash system. You've got to, you know,
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:19.360]  protect the state. You've got to do this. You're the boss. You're the authority. This is policy.
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:25.920]  And, you know, you're in danger. Your fellow officers come first. They are all that matters.
[1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:31.280]  Oh, my God, another officer was killed in this other state yesterday. No, it's, you're under
[1:21:31.280 --> 1:21:37.360]  such incredible threat that, you know, the criminals have bigger weapons now. It's much more dangerous.
[1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:42.720]  And meanwhile, you see cops hanging their hind ends out in the middle of the highway,
[1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:48.400]  writing tickets, and that's what's killing them. But see, they don't teach you what to fear.
[1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:54.240]  They do teach you what to fear instead of telling you and teaching you what to really fear.
[1:21:54.240 --> 1:22:01.280]  You see, they don't explain to you what is a real danger. It's like Myanmar,
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:05.600]  formerly known as Burma. You can criticize their police and criticize their corrupt government
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:09.920]  because see, we know their third world cesspit run by corrupt thugs, just like we're becoming.
[1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:15.200]  But, you know, oh my gosh, five days in and no way was allowed in. Oh, our government's so good.
[1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:22.240]  Well, what about our government in Katrina? See, it's all about grandstanding. But 29,000,
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:27.440]  it's 28,000 and change dead. And they're talking about it could be hundreds of thousands dead.
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:33.600]  They don't know. But notice how, you know, they're not saying change our whole way of life because
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:37.280]  of that, because the terrorists are going to get us. But, but, but it actually is a real threat.
[1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:41.200]  But in a way, Al Gore is saying, it's manmade global warming. Give up all your rights. It's
[1:22:41.200 --> 1:22:45.120]  real. We're all dead. There's always been typhoons. There's always been hurricanes.
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:48.720]  There's always been cyclones that have done this. That's what it's like.
[1:22:48.720 --> 1:22:56.480]  That's what happens. Carbon dioxide is what humans exhale. It's good for the earth. It's not
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:01.920]  a devil gas. I'm already digressing and I said I'd take your calls and I got a lot to cover.
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:09.360]  The point is, is that all that you see is about making you the enemy. The government is making
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:15.200]  you the enemy. Let's talk to Kyle and Bastroff, Texas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:22.240]  Hey, Alex, I just picked up the recent current issue of Wired magazine and there's a
[1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:28.320]  commentary in here about autism being the next step in the evolution for the human mind.
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:34.320]  Can you prove how absurd that is? Well, that's because via the injections and the rest of the
[1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:37.840]  things they're putting in us that the federal government admits now is causing autism,
[1:23:37.840 --> 1:23:46.720]  that when you go from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 168 to 1 in 76 now last year and when half the population
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:52.800]  has it and it's all part of a larger eugenics program, we have the documents on it. Yes,
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:59.120]  I did see that. It's normal that one in two is going to have cancer and it's normal that one
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:04.320]  in five is going to have autism. It's normal to have police in black masks and cameras on every
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:10.080]  street corner. Yeah, I mean, but the next part of it where it says, oh, well, it'll help us, you
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:16.240]  know, create better people for specific fields of work we want to do. That's when it really hit me
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:22.240]  and it actually helps me understand how the new order system works. Every in the media wants to
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:27.520]  say that the whole conspiracy system is everybody meeting in the Legion of Doom with Dr. Daphne
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:33.200]  and yada, yada, yada, and that's the conspiracy theory, but really from my research of how the
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:39.920]  new order works, it's a bunch of sick combines who team up and agree on turf and agree on enslaving,
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:45.280]  sucking more off of us because they all agree on the happy hunting ground feeding on us. Go ahead.
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:51.680]  It's more of a, you know, different interlocking businesses that it's, it's an, as you put it
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:58.160]  in oligopoly, it gets to this game theory where they work together sometimes, but then they'll
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:03.520]  there's no backs of each other and that's usually when we see our major wars is when the interest
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:10.080]  can't can't agree on something is then they start a war and then they through there they use different
[1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:15.920]  concepts of this one's perfect, a perfect word for it. It's called leverage. That's how you can
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:21.840]  get the cock who means well to go out there and you know, rubber bull or taser people with
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:28.400]  six, what, you know, 50,000 volts of 60 hertz current and make them in capacitated. That's
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:32.240]  how you get them to do this is it's the form of leverage. They think they're doing well,
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.120]  but you're feeding them the exactly you have, you have downloaded into them through the culture,
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:41.200]  through the media, that they're the guardian, that this is for their own good. The police are,
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:47.200]  you see them now just shaking in fear, walking up to old ladies. There's terrorist everywhere.
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:52.000]  Meanwhile, deer, deer jumping out are going to kill more of them than criminals. You see, but,
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.800]  but again, it's that download. It's like adults swimming the ocean and they're deathly afraid
[1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:03.680]  of sharks when on average 12 people a year die of sharks. Okay, but it doesn't matter. Still,
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:08.960]  adults won't go out in the surf now. I mean, when I was a kid, people went swimming now they don't
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:16.720]  because we're just this just a bunch of cowards, you know, afraid of carbon dioxide, a life-giving
[1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:22.400]  gas and afraid of sharks that aren't out there aren't going to bite you and afraid of terrorists.
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:28.880]  Exactly. Anything else, sir? I just want to add on to the other collar who caught him earlier
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:34.160]  about ways to, you know, to keep the new order. I would say that the basic thing you should do
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:39.120]  also to a study business because this is how they operate. This is the skeletal frame of how they
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:44.000]  operate and not only do you understand how they operate, but you can also to create your center,
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:48.080]  your power structures. Exactly. Power structures as well. Exactly. And
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:55.040]  this is what I want people out there listening to understand. We are all under attack. This is a
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:00.240]  scientific dictatorship. They don't have to look and roll. This is bad for 90% of the people that
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:04.880]  you're even the higher levels of their system. We have got to beat these people and we've got
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:10.160]  to beat them now. Okay. I mean, look, cops out there, you're in the same boat as we are and
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:17.200]  someday you're going to figure that out. A lot of you already have. Let's go ahead and talk to
[1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:23.120]  Steve in Texas. You're on the air, Steve. Yeah. First of all, before I get to the main reason
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:27.280]  I called, I just want to say in reference to what you were saying about TV, you know, I've told
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:34.000]  people, why do you think they call it programming? Duh. Well, I mean, why do they call us human
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  resources? Because 80 years ago, they codified eugenics in the social planning out of England
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:47.520]  and out of Germany and in the US and they admit that is a eugenics term for us, the human resources.
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:53.520]  Go ahead. Right. I wanted to share that there's a good friend of mine in a Bible college here in
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:28:02.320]  East Texas and he shared something with me just recently. This is in Marshall, Texas. Within the
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:08.080]  past year, a group of Boy Scouts came there to the college on a tour and he's one of the most
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:13.280]  upstanding students in the college. He's very, you know, well spoken. Tell us real fast what
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:18.480]  happened. We'll come back and talk more about it. Okay. Tell us real fast. Okay. Well, what happened
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:24.160]  was he was asked to give a talk on what it means to be an American and so he told them to read the
[1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:30.640]  Bill of Rights and your Constitution. The next day he was called into the office of the administration
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:36.240]  and there was a state trooper and I knew it. They're going to say it's terrorism. Stay there.
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:42.400]  Folks, they teach all police that the Constitution is terrorism. We have it on video. All police
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:45.040]  who are mid-level and above. We'll be right back, terrorists.

[1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:55.280]  On September 11, 2001, the New World Order hijacked our government and began the process

[1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:05.280]  do not intervene immediately, they will succeed. It is time we stand together now and make our

[1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:16.880]  By the way, if you're a new listener, I'm not joking. Do you think they're going to have one in
[1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:23.920]  10 college graduates graduating for a Homeland Security related job to spy on you and watch the
[1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:29.920]  cameras and surveil and datamine and put a million of you on terrorist lists to begin with?
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:36.480]  But leave the border wide open, of course. Do you think they're going to do all that and not
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:42.160]  say you're the terrorist? Before 9-11 even happened, we have FBI training manuals, the SLAT
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:47.600]  training manuals for the federal marshals that are then used for state police nationwide
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:54.240]  in the intelligence units where it says those that make frequent references to the U.S. Constitution,
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:58.560]  those that talk about the Founding Fathers, those that say get us out of the U.N.
[1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:03.280]  And then I've even seen that in, quote, you know, law enforcement technology magazine and others.
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:08.320]  I mean, I've put this in films. I've got this in my film, Road to Terony. And then I in Road to
[1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:13.680]  Terony. This is before 9-11, a firefighter in Kansas City, KCXL, still an affiliate there.
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:17.440]  What is that? Like 10 years, they've been an affiliate. We love you guys. They even carry the
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:22.960]  Sunday show, KCXL there in Kansas City. I'll cover in that city and several others out of Liberty,
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:28.960]  Missouri. They, he goes to this meeting he's supposed to go to and it's a week long course
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:34.160]  and it's FEMA, a guy high and tight commando saying Founding Fathers are bad, they're terrorist.
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:38.720]  This mindset is evil and anti-government. We've got to deal with people that are like
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:43.440]  the Founding Fathers. I mean, I have video of cops from the back of the classroom filled
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:47.200]  with FEMA. I've got 18 hours of it. I put like two minutes in the film,
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:52.640]  Road to Terony, but that's on the web. Just type FEMA says Founding Fathers, George Washington
[1:34:52.640 --> 1:34:59.680]  terrorist and it'll come up. Now, I'm going back to you. You say there was a state trooper
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:03.120]  waiting at the college. You've given us your friend's number. We're going to call him.
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:07.440]  I totally believe you. I can already guess the story. And let me guess, he told him
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:11.600]  that the Declaration of Independence is prohibited. Is that what he was, you know,
[1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:14.240]  I'm going to shut up. Start over. Tell folks what happened.
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:23.040]  Well, as he was asked to give a talk to these Boy Scouts about what it means to be a true American.
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:28.240]  Now, again, tell us who he is at the school. Okay. He's one of the students at the school
[1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:33.520]  and he's also a pastor of a small church there in Marshall. He's an interim pastor. Well,
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:38.960]  let me just expand. I've been asked to let Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts in here three times and I've
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:43.440]  had him in and been nice. So it's the same thing. I'm probably all caught in out too, but go ahead.
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:48.640]  Right. And so the first thing that came to mind was we're told to read your bill of rights in
[1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:54.400]  the Constitution. So that's what he told them the next day he was called in the administration's
[1:35:54.400 --> 1:36:00.000]  office. It was the president of the school, a state trooper and he, this is what he said,
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:06.160]  a man on a black suit with dark sunglasses and military style boots. God, these thugs are
[1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:10.080]  everywhere. And that was the guy that questioned him and he said, did you say this, this and this?
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:14.960]  They had a transcript of everything he said to these boys. Yeah, I spy on everybody. This
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:20.160]  country's completely gone. Go ahead. And the thing that he ended up telling him was, did you know
[1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:26.560]  you could be found guilty of inciting terrorism? So, and they said for the bill of rights, Constitution,
[1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:31.440]  Declaration of Independence. Yes, sir. Well, I mean, have you seen Rotority? I've, that's
[1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:36.080]  standard. Yeah, that's the first time I actually showed this friend of mine. See, I'm the one
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:40.320]  that turned him on to your staff like Terror Storm and he's been showing this stuff to people in
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:46.160]  his school. So I'd imagine he's been marked out now because he's on the 9 11 truth band wagon.
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:50.880]  Well, well, let me just expand here for listeners. This isn't America with a K. This isn't red dawn.
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:56.800]  This isn't a joke. The CIA has overthrown hundreds of countries. They're just doing it for the
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:02.080]  bankers now. And all over the country, they have infrastructure protection, infregard.
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:06.880]  They have 26,000 preachers. I told you this a year and a half before it went on the news.
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:13.040]  I got the secret documents to quote, turn your guns in, go to camps. Now, now, now think of this,
[1:37:13.040 --> 1:37:18.160]  are you a terrorist? If you read the Declaration of Independence, or is the person saying that's
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:24.160]  bad or they the terrorist? Well, it's obvious to me which way it is. Who's the bad guy? I mean,
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:28.880]  I mean, you know, back in the 80s or this, if the Russians landed the Soviets, you know,
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:33.200]  in America with a K, they're saying the Constitution's bad. See, I mean, but folks,
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:37.680]  I don't, I don't have to believe this guy on the line. Though I know it's true from, you know,
[1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:44.640]  I instinctively from 1,000 cases. The point is, is that I have it on video and I have the actual
[1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:50.480]  training doctrine. Okay, the government, I can't believe it. I mean, why do we even have to,
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:56.000]  why does this have to happen? Why do there have to be goons in black suits with sunglasses
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.200]  trying to intimidate people? Well, now you've given us your friend's name and number,
[1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:02.240]  and I'm going to call him after the show. I want to get you both on the show tomorrow.
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:04.880]  Will he come on the show and talk about his great evil?
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:09.440]  Oh, yeah, sir. I've been encouraging him to call you. He's just so busy with his studies and his
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:14.640]  past. So what did he tell these goons? What did he tell these goons? Well, he asked them first
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:20.080]  of all, how did you get this information? And secondly, he's got cameras and microphones in
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:24.480]  every classroom, right? But he basically stood his ground and he said, there's nothing that I'm
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:29.040]  doing in committing a crime and you have no grounds for your accusation. He told that political
[1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:34.800]  officer that commas are what he, I hope he told him he was the terrorist. Well, basically that's what
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:39.840]  in America we got secret police coming and telling pastors what they could say. Oh,
[1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:44.400]  that's enough of it. You're the terrorist and shame on you. You're protecting the murderers
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:48.400]  that carried out the attacks and you're not going to get away with it. Yes, sir.
[1:38:48.400 --> 1:38:53.600]  Hey, and ask, I wanted to ask you one quick question. This book that Vincent Boo. Hold on,
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:57.840]  I'm stopping you. I'm stopping you right there. Who cares what's what's what this guy,
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:02.000]  this quackery about JFK and not being killed by the government? Everybody knows the truth.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:08.400]  But before we go any further, put him on hold for a minute. I'm just, I'm just totally freaking
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:11.920]  out here. I may even have time to play the Tommy Chong stuff or the other things. I'm
[1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:18.720]  going to take your calls. Oh God. I'm the normal one, folks. You get excited about UT football
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:24.640]  and you on screen? Fine. You look, let me tell you something. Men in black suits and sunglasses
[1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:32.000]  saying, don't you teach Cub Scouts the Declaration of Independence? That's insane. But I've got their
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:37.600]  training manuals. I know they do it. You know what it's like to know these terrorists are all
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:42.320]  around us building their camps. It's in the Houston Chronicle. They built camps for us.
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:47.440]  They paid off most of the preachers. They're waiting to stage something else. I'm on a death
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:53.680]  list with these people or they win and I am mad. I can't enjoy my life because of this.
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:58.960]  I finally did for just a few days and then it just makes me so angry. Think about me, folks.
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:04.640]  I'm not the bad person being for the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence
[1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:10.400]  is not bad and I want all the police listening across the country. If you're having to question
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:14.960]  right now who the good guy is and who the bad guy is, there's something wrong with you.
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:24.960]  I have FEMA on tape in 2000 teaching police that the founding fathers are bad. I have had enough
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:32.080]  of your treason and enough of your traitorous crap. Excuse me. I just, I just, why has this
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:36.480]  country turned into this? Why did this happen to our nation? You realize how creepy that is
[1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:41.200]  that these goons in their sunglasses, like that's going to intimidate somebody? You know why they're
[1:40:41.200 --> 1:40:46.000]  scared? They know we know they ship in the drugs. They know we know they run all sorts of criminal
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:50.880]  activity and this is just the criminals trying to take over so we can't overthrow them and they
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:54.640]  know there's going to be terrorism because they're going to push people and then when we fight back
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:41:01.440]  they're going to call us terrorists. I can't believe it. I can't believe you teach people George
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:09.600]  Washington is bad. I have you on video, you bastards. I'm the normal person. I'm normal.
[1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:16.160]  You're not normal out there. If you're not mad about this, go ahead Steve. You still there?
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:21.280]  Much to the way you're being right now. I constantly every day make it a point to tell
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:25.600]  people about your sight and about your documentaries and loose chains and other things.
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:32.000]  And I have people say, oh, come on, calm down. I can't. I've got. We got goons in black suits
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:37.280]  and sunglasses telling people that we can't talk about the Declaration of Independence.
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:41.360]  Well, it's because people don't understand that guy needs to hate. Hey, hey, hey,
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:48.000]  did he demand that person's name and information? I'm not really sure you'll have to ask him that.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.720]  But listen, as Americans as Alexander Schultz and Eatzen wrote in Gulag Archipelago, if we don't
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:57.200]  stand up against this and make a big deal out of this and have demonstrations about this everywhere
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:02.080]  it happens, they're going to win. They built. They want to put us in camps. They want to take
[1:42:02.080 --> 1:42:07.600]  our freedom. They want to enslave us. They want to push us around. They think they're going to
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:12.960]  push us around. That's what this is all about is teaching us how to be slaves. And I for one
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:17.760]  have had enough of it. Steve, I'm going to call you. I'm going to call the pastor. I need to get
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:21.520]  some documentation from the school already believe your case. We're going to make a big deal about
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:28.000]  this. Okay. Appreciate it. Listen to this weirdo. He doesn't stand with our Homeland Security
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  teaching that the Declaration of Independence is evil. Don't you understand? They're the terrorist.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:39.040]  They carried out the attacks. Don't you understand that? Can't you compute that? You know what they're
[1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:43.520]  going to do as they win? You know what they're going to do as they take over? They ride back.

[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:57.840]  Flower is already being rationed. Prices on food are getting so high warehouses are installing
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:04.560]  security systems and guards. You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food. We're all in a
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:10.080]  foot race as to whether the food will become so expensive we can't afford it, or there will be no
[1:44:10.080 --> 1:44:16.080]  food at any price. We can't grow enough of our own food even with genetically altered trash. It will
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:22.000]  give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food. They think God didn't get it right, so
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:27.920]  Monsanto had to step in. If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay.

[1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:44.320]  a little bit crazy. That's okay, because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:56.480]  Men, are you urinating more frequently? Do you wake up to urinate? Now be honest,

[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:57.360]  diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment. But as you know, most people are
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:03.520]  overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise. pH balance is the foundation of energy
[1:46:03.520 --> 1:46:08.320]  abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease. People who alkalize the water they
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:13.360]  drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight. It was intended
[1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:18.320]  for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly
[1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:23.520]  acidic. The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment. Fat accumulates
[1:46:23.520 --> 1:46:28.480]  if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it. Do your part,
[1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:34.480]  alkalize, and supercharge your body now. Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:40.320]  concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:46.800]  Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:48.880]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:57.840]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:20.320]  Yeah, they just grow that stuff down in Columbia and CIA aircraft crash all the time filled with drugs.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:25.200]  What, maybe one out of a thousand planes crashes, one out of 10,000?
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:29.200]  And there have been hundreds of CIA aircraft crash with cocaine?
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:36.960]  That means millions of CIA aircraft bringing that in. And when your dumb kid uses it,
[1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:42.000]  they're going to throw them in a private prison owned by the big banks that launder all that money.
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:47.920]  They're going to teach your police that the Bill of Rights is evil.
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:54.960]  And anybody that talks about it is a terrorist. No, you're the terrorist.
[1:47:57.200 --> 1:48:01.120]  All right, CNN's attacking us, putting out this info. I don't even know if I have time to play
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:05.440]  this clip. I got Tommy Chong was on the show Friday. I was at the beach, but I called him
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:09.680]  while my guest host, Bermas, was interviewing him, Jason Bermas. And I thought I'd play a
[1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:13.680]  minute or two of that. But you know what, I get emails from cops occasionally going,
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:18.400]  laughing, going, you make this stuff up. I didn't make any of this up. And they are teaching your
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:25.120]  commanders and your intelligence units and the rest of those people that the Declaration of
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:30.080]  Independence is evil and terrorist. And I have it on video and that's the end of it. And a year
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:35.120]  and a half before it came out that 26,000 preachers have been hired. I reported on a year and a
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:39.040]  half before and got the secret documents. And then Homeland Security was waiting at the preacher's
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:44.240]  house in his office when he came back and they said, would you give him that for? It's all
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:48.640]  intimidation, a bunch of goons that have no jurisdiction. It's disgusting.
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:54.720]  I know the Declaration of Independence is bad. Some of you are out there listening. Cops and
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:59.920]  cars going, good America is bad. You got to get rid of them feloning fathers. It's just so sick.
[1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:04.400]  But I know most of you know the truth and you know we're in deep trouble. It's just so sick.
[1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:09.920]  Let's go ahead and play a few minutes of Tommy Chong saying a 9-11's an inside job. And he's
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:14.080]  not a German defense minister. He's not Jesse Ventura and he's not Willie Nelson, but he's
[1:49:14.080 --> 1:49:19.600]  Tommy Chong and hell it's interesting. Here it is. People on the show and now to have Tommy
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:24.160]  Chong come out on the show and say that he questions the official story. I mean, just so
[1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:29.200]  your statement is clear. Are you saying you believe that they use it to take our liberties?
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:34.640]  Or are you saying that on top of it you believe that they may have somehow been involved? I mean,
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:40.720]  you know, with the buildings being blown up, the hijacking drills that day the government was
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:45.200]  running. I mean, bottom line, what do you think about 9-11? Well, yeah, you just said it right
[1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:50.400]  there. And the thing is, you know, you could speculate, but you don't have to speculate with
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:55.600]  facts. These are cold hard facts. The facts that the Bin Laden family was allowed to escape
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:50:03.760]  America. I mean, that's a fact. The fact that certain people weren't in the buildings that
[1:50:03.760 --> 1:50:08.640]  kind of knew the buildings were going to go down. That's a fact. And there's all these facts. And
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:15.120]  just like there's a fact of the firemen, you know, why the firemen were receiving each other,
[1:50:15.120 --> 1:50:22.320]  you know, when they found a dead fireman, that only firemen were allowed to rescue the body,
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:28.160]  you know, and there's a book out there about that, why that is. I won't even say on the air why
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:34.800]  that only firemen were allowed, because I don't want to, I want people to read for themselves,
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:39.920]  you know, so Google or whatever you can to New York Firemen that were at the World Trade Center.
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:46.240]  And these are facts. And so I'm not one for speculating. Absolutely. Tommy, what do you
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:51.440]  think about building 7, not hit by a plane, but perfectly imploding? We have video of police,
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:55.280]  firemen, others saying the government says, get back, we're going to bring it down. Have you
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:51:01.600]  seen that? No, I haven't seen that one. But I can believe it, you know, definitely. Well,
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:08.320]  well, let me just one more point. That's it. That's it. You can hear the whole hour-long
[1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:12.800]  interview with Tommy Chung at infowars.com when the show's over. If you want to go find that.
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:18.320]  Very interesting. Covered a host of issues. They've rated and seized 10,000 of a new film
[1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:22.800]  that somebody else made about them railroading him and setting him up for marijuana pipes,
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:29.520]  something his kids were selling. Just why it's so sick. And he talks about how he smoked pot
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:34.000]  with Governor Schwarzenegger just even before he was elected. I mean, the year before,
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:39.920]  it's just such a hypocritical system. Oh, by the way, police and firemen and people that think
[1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:45.520]  that the government likes you. You know what I did two days after 9-11? Because I'm smart and I have
[1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:50.800]  a lot of expert people that advise me. I said that those buildings are asbestos. And we have reports
[1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:56.400]  of that. And the people are collapsing from breathing it. Don't mail bottled water or money
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:03.120]  because the Red Cross and United Way are known to keep the money for themselves. People got mad
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:06.560]  at me for that. And later said, how'd you know? Well, they always get caught keeping the majority
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:09.840]  of the money. You know, they raise $5 billion. They keep $3 billion for themselves. I said,
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:16.320]  send them gas masks and breathing apparatus. And I sent it to two local churches and we got
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:22.240]  thousands of masks sent. A lot of the masks you see in the days after my listeners, you. Again,
[1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:25.760]  because we're into how the world actually works. We're actually, we're trying to help the police
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:33.040]  and firemen and emergency workers and rescue workers. And we said day one and, you know,
[1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:38.000]  I've got a film I put out five years ago about the dust. Well, now the government admits and
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:42.320]  the governor and others have to admit that thousands are dead and dying. And they're all
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:45.920]  the major hospitals are admitting there's been a cover up and the government ordered them to
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:50.640]  engage in a cover up that the police and firemen and others are dying from this. So I'm a conspiracy
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:57.280]  theorist again, right? I'm always a conspiracy theorist. That's right. I mean, it's not hard when
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:00.880]  you got five feet of asbestos on the ground to say you better wear a mask when you're in there.
[1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:08.800]  State says hundreds of 9 11 rescue workers now dead admits undercount first responders
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:14.640]  representatives. It's the tip of the iceberg. New York Daily News reports that 10,000 workers
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:21.600]  are probably going to be dying from it. Thousands have already died. 600 currently have cancer.
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:26.000]  They do scans of their lungs. Some of the people's lungs are like a third full of
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.600]  particular. I mean, it's just, it's just I've met them. I've seen them. I've known them.
[1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:33.440]  I know people that have died going up there over the years meeting with them. And by the
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:39.440]  way, we are change.org did help get meetings in Congress. I helped donate money. I actually
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:44.400]  donated money. So did others. But I've donated thousands of dollars to help send buses. The
[1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:48.880]  first responders last year to Congress to finally have hearings to pay for their hotels.
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:53.360]  So I'm tuning our horn here because, you know, I'm here saying, please don't say my founding
[1:53:53.360 --> 1:53:57.440]  fathers or terrorists. Please don't take my guns in my second amendment. Please stop treating me
[1:53:57.440 --> 1:54:01.760]  like a slave. Oh, by the way, here's gas mask and money. You know, oh, please don't breathe the poison
[1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:08.400]  dust. I believe them. I love them. You're going to find out they could care less about you.
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:12.880]  And I'm almost out of time here. There's all this other news seeing in.
[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:20.560]  I was on the treadmill at the hotel at the beach and I had this feeling. I've been on it 30 minutes
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:25.360]  that I should keep watching. And it turns out right when I quit watching, this came on. It's
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:32.880]  that prime time weekend on headline news. And I was watching the same host you're about to hear
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:37.680]  show two dozen cops physically attack three shooting suspects. It turned out they weren't
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:43.120]  involved in a car. Beat them up and the cops run up and start beating the cars like orangutans.
[1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:49.280]  They start kicking the car. When they first get there, like mad monkeys on PCP, if they were such
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:53.200]  shooters and killers, you should have pulled up behind them, told them to get out on the ground.
[1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:57.680]  But then the guy who comes on the show and talks about police training and how it's actually good
[1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:02.320]  that they physically attack the three people. So, so, so, so I get off the treadmill leave.
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:05.680]  I just got home and learned that we have a whole tape right after I got off the treadmill.
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:10.640]  So I never watch mainline TV. I have this feeling I should keep watching right after I leave. He
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:15.440]  comes on and has this nitwit on trying to decipher what we're saying. Let's play a minute or so
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:32.880]  with this. Here it is CNN. I'm not sure what clip I wanted to play that CNN clip from the start.
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:37.120]  I don't know what clip. You know what? I think when I gave you that page, I think you did a
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:42.640]  Google search. You pull up a wrong link. It's not a DC Madam clip. It's CNN. Oh hell, it doesn't
[1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:50.800]  matter. Up on infowars.com right now. Headline and prisonplanet.com. CNN hit piece attempts to
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:58.960]  debunk Palfrey murder. And as CNN's headline prime with this goofball host sits there and
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:05.840]  shows prison planet and says they claim that she told her landlord that she might be being followed.
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:11.280]  No, she said, I fear they're going to kill me. Not, not people claim she might have said this.
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:16.240]  And she said on my show, I'm not going to kill myself. She said, I'm not going to kill myself.
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:23.440]  So I just ran out of time. That's it for this transmission. I'm sorry to Harvey, Bob, Vaughn,
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:29.280]  and many others that are patiently holding. I passionately love liberty. A lot of you think
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:35.200]  that you are going to stay out of this. You think you're just going to sit by and see what happens.
[1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:39.120]  You think you're going to play it safe and not get involved in defending freedom and liberty
[1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:44.160]  and this republic. And you're just like people in Germany who denied and denied or people in Russia
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:48.960]  or people in China or people in a hundred other countries that thought they would just go along
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:53.920]  and everything would be okay, who knew something was wrong, but said, Oh, I'll leave it to other
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:59.440]  men to do it. I'll leave it to other people to fight tyranny. And then you allow the tyranny
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:05.120]  to take hold. This is all aimed at you that own car dealerships and own marinas and own businesses
[1:57:05.120 --> 1:57:10.320]  and own companies and own restaurants. It's all aimed at your bank accounts. It's aimed at raising
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:16.800]  taxes to 89% as they probably plan to. It's all aimed at raping you and slapping you upside the
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:23.360]  head and squeezing you and showing you the new old orders. Boss next Saturday, 3 30 Alamo draft house
[1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:29.040]  downtown. I'll be showing my new film 9 11 Chronicles Truth Rising, an amazing documentary.
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:35.280]  And then Sunday at 6 30. God bless you all. See you back live next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Go out there
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:40.000]  and take on tyranny. Stand up for liberty. Who cares if they say freedoms terrorism? They're the
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:44.320]  terror. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. As you know, GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and all he stands

[1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:04.640]  order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
