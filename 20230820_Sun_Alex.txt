[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  6th, 2001. Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]  Visit InfoWars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  As most of us have feared, the lockdowns are coming back.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  Federal officials from the TSA and from the US Border Patrol have contacted InfoWars and revealed that the Biden administration is now setting the stage for full COVID lockdowns.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  The whistleblowers told us that they will begin in mid-September with incremental restrictions such as masking TSA employees and then masking other government employees and then masking non-government workers and then masking everyone.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  Fires and floods are everywhere and our billionaire ruling class are now being very open about their plans to lock us all down again in order to save humanity.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  One thing that maybe surprised you most, something you learned the last year?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  Well, I learned that people don't know as much as they think they know, but the biggest thing you learn is that the pandemic was bound to occur and this isn't the worst one that's imaginable at all.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  Society has a terrible time preparing for things that are remote, that are possible, and will occur sooner or later.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  There will be another pandemic, we know that.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:33.000]  We know there's a nuclear chemical, biological and now cyber threat, and each one of those has terrible possibilities and we do some things about it.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000]  But it's just not something that society seems particularly capable when fully coming to grips with.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  The cyber threat that we've just started and look at the damage that's already been done.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  The mask mandates are coming back, the lockdowns are returning.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  Will you comply or will you stand together against this decrepit old tyranny that seeks to rule over us all?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  Now is the time to make that decision.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Ries.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  Go to band.video, download the videos and share.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  And never give up the fight.

[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday night.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  We are live August 20th, 2023.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  We have major updates on the plan we discovered to bring back COVID restrictions.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  That's now the top story in the country.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  We'll be right back on Alex Jones.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  It is game changing.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund or operation a 360 win.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now for escape to prison planet light roast.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  That's the strongest, the amazing medium roast wig of America.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  And finally, the best tasting dark roast tip of the spear, now exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]  Get your coffee now.
[00:05:59.836 --> 00:06:19.316]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:24.956]  so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.836 --> 00:06:39.796]  We're live. It's Sunday, August 20th, 2023. I want to thank the great crew for being here
[00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:44.716]  and want to thank all of you out there for tuning in and sharing the links from Infowars.com
[00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:49.076]  board slash show where they can find not just my forbidden attack broadcast and all
[00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:57.196]  the other great Infowars transmissions. Okay. So I learned on Thursday from a TSA
[00:06:57.236 --> 00:07:01.156]  source that I know personally who's high up that they told them starting the middle of next month,
[00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:05.996]  you're going to wear a mask again because of the new variant out of Canada and that we expect to
[00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:11.276]  make all the travelers wear masks again and that Biden's going to give an order in the middle of
[00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:15.836]  October and then just try to bring the restrictions into next year. And I called
[00:07:15.836 --> 00:07:20.036]  other federal sources and confirmed with another one that indeed in the Border Patrol, they'd been
[00:07:20.036 --> 00:07:25.196]  told get ready. Now the story became the number one story, hands down, top of Twitter,
[00:07:25.196 --> 00:07:32.556]  everywhere, 30 million views, just on Twitter alone, just absolutely insane. The clips from
[00:07:32.556 --> 00:07:38.916]  Friday show and it caused a huge big online firestorm and the mainstream media misrepresented
[00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:44.916]  what I said. I said they intend to bring these back or at least they're telling the feds that
[00:07:44.916 --> 00:07:51.196]  and we can stand against it and say no, that's why the last lockdowns got ended worldwide. So
[00:07:51.196 --> 00:07:56.236]  it's not a foregone conclusion, but I was told that. Now, I came on the air at 11am
[00:07:56.236 --> 00:08:06.076]  on Friday and began talking about it. And people picked up the broadcast, they know I don't make
[00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:10.596]  stuff up. And they were taking it seriously, a lot of traction, which is good. So we can get
[00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:14.236]  ahead of this and not let them just incrementally roll it out like they did three and a half years
[00:08:14.236 --> 00:08:18.796]  ago. And we know with the election coming up next year, they will do mail-in ballots again.
[00:08:18.796 --> 00:08:26.196]  And then something very interesting happened at five o'clock on the nightly news, ABC, NBC, CBS,
[00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:32.316]  all the local national news across the country, the local news, the national news, all of it,
[00:08:32.316 --> 00:08:37.996]  said, oh my gosh, COVID cases way up, big problems, experts recommend mask again,
[00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:43.556]  you know, we may have to go back to the COVID restrictions of a few years ago. Because of it,
[00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:47.716]  it's the worst ever, the UN's looking at doing something about it. But don't worry,
[00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:54.436]  they just so happened to have just made a new Pfizer Moderna mRNA shot for the new variant
[00:08:54.436 --> 00:09:05.596]  that comes out middle of September. And then everybody in the entire populist common sense
[00:09:05.596 --> 00:09:11.436]  sphere, that's the dominant most popular shows, across the board went, whoa. So the internet
[00:09:11.436 --> 00:09:20.716]  exploded, exploded with taking clips of what I said in the morning, with clips that were said
[00:09:20.716 --> 00:09:24.556]  in the afternoon, and people pointed it out that it wasn't being said the day before. So I happen
[00:09:24.556 --> 00:09:29.756]  to catch them literally right before they launched their new propaganda campaign. Well,
[00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:33.716]  that's obvious. They're going to tell the TSA and War Patrol a few days before. So they told
[00:09:33.716 --> 00:09:38.716]  senior managers on Tuesday, this was coming, they haven't even told TSA yet, I was told.
[00:09:38.716 --> 00:09:42.796]  War Patrol, I know some senior people, they're like, yeah, we were told Wednesday,
[00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:46.076]  get ready for it. We'll get guidelines the next few weeks, middle of September. Yeah.
[00:09:46.076 --> 00:09:55.196]  And so I went with it because it's extremely credible. And look, I get tons of tips from
[00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:59.036]  really credible people like, well, we're told the Russians are going to invade. They'll invade
[00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:06.236]  by late February. I was told that in October. I got it from one credible source. I talked
[00:10:06.236 --> 00:10:12.716]  to two more credible sources. And then I just so happened to go visit some family who's got a
[00:10:12.716 --> 00:10:18.956]  son that is on army special operations. And they said, well, he doesn't tell us that we know
[00:10:18.956 --> 00:10:23.675]  he's really in Ukraine. He's not in Poland. And they're told Putin's going in by the end of
[00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:31.036]  February. So it was not me looking into a crystal ball, the great Karnak with, you know,
[00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:35.756]  late night TV shows like Jimmy Carson. I'd made the call. I said, I've got sources. They
[00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:39.836]  say they think Putin's going in when the Russians said they weren't going in. I went on air and I
[00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:43.756]  said, the state department's telling the truth this time. They are going in. Remember the state
[00:10:43.756 --> 00:10:48.476]  department official got attacked by Reuters, Navy reporters saying, you're Alex Jones.
[00:10:49.036 --> 00:10:51.836]  You're claiming the Russians are going to stage a false flight to go into Ukraine.
[00:10:53.196 --> 00:10:57.356]  They're like, watch, he is going in because they, they got the chatter folks. They knew
[00:10:57.356 --> 00:11:02.316]  the Russians were massing troops. They weren't playing games. They told NATO, if you keep
[00:11:02.316 --> 00:11:06.156]  trying to bring them in, we're going to invade. And they got to invade and have at least a month
[00:11:06.156 --> 00:11:11.196]  before the ground unfreezes because it's a giant black soil. It's the best soil in the world,
[00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:16.316]  10 feet deep. And the tanks can't roll across that after March. So they got to have a month
[00:11:16.316 --> 00:11:22.876]  to invade. You got to go by late February. He invaded on February 24th. So it's the same
[00:11:22.876 --> 00:11:27.196]  thing here. I mean, I just tell you what I know. It's like a week before they indicted Trump.
[00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:32.396]  I have courthouse sources. I'm not going to get into the specifics of it. We have a lot
[00:11:32.396 --> 00:11:38.556]  of listeners and a lot of viewers and a lot of people. And they were there and saw the head
[00:11:38.556 --> 00:11:43.516]  of security in a meeting saying they're going to indict him and it'll be next Tuesday or
[00:11:43.516 --> 00:11:48.556]  Wednesday. And he'll, he'll be arraigned a few days later. It happened exactly like I said,
[00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:53.436]  because it was exactly the source. Now they could have decided to not indict him on that Tuesday
[00:11:54.316 --> 00:12:01.036]  and not arraign him on Thursday. But what we got from eye witnesses that saw the head of the,
[00:12:01.036 --> 00:12:07.596]  that DC courthouse say, I told you that. Now that's not as big a story obviously as
[00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:11.356]  new lockdowns and I'm not saying they're going to get away with it, but on my children,
[00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:17.196]  this has been told to me directly by these folks in an attempt to stop it happening again.
[00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:23.196]  We're warning you, you can bet your bottom dollar that this happened.
[00:12:24.796 --> 00:12:28.876]  Now it doesn't mean if there's pressure or Congress hears about it,
[00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:34.236]  and there's already US senators getting upset about this, that we can't let Biden and Obama
[00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:38.156]  that controls him in the deep state know, hey, we're not going to go along with this.
[00:12:38.156 --> 00:12:44.316]  So that's why we're talking about this and why I stuck my neck out because I said on the show
[00:12:44.316 --> 00:12:49.516]  that right when I covered it, I said, if we're successful and stop this,
[00:12:50.556 --> 00:12:53.596]  they'll say, well, he's not always right. See, they didn't do it.
[00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:59.036]  That's fine because that's not what I said. I said, they're going to try it.
[00:12:59.036 --> 00:13:01.675]  They've already told the federal people get ready.
[00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:06.636]  Clearly they're thinking about trying it now. I wasn't sure they'd still try it,
[00:13:06.636 --> 00:13:10.156]  but they already had it pre-programmed and ready days after the feds were told
[00:13:10.476 --> 00:13:15.915]  for a complete roll out on the public. Because the feds are at the border patrol and ICE and
[00:13:16.796 --> 00:13:23.356]  the military and the TSA, they're going to ask, well, why weren't we told if it breaks
[00:13:23.356 --> 00:13:28.396]  on Friday afternoon? And they're going to be like, why weren't we told? Well, they were told
[00:13:28.396 --> 00:13:36.476]  before. And then now I've got literally dozens of newscasts saying the same script.
[00:13:36.476 --> 00:13:40.556]  And you've seen how people take compilations of the vaccine propaganda and other things
[00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:45.196]  and shown how ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, doesn't matter. It's all the same script, the same words,
[00:13:45.196 --> 00:13:49.996]  the same propaganda. Somebody needs to do this with the propaganda of Friday afternoon,
[00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:54.636]  Saturday, and today, because now it's everywhere. It's in the local newspaper.
[00:13:54.636 --> 00:13:59.276]  It's on all the local TV stations. Oh my gosh, deadly virus, worse, terrible,
[00:13:59.276 --> 00:14:02.796]  major hospitalizations happening. No one knows why there's so many deaths.
[00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:06.876]  They think it's COVID, we've got to have a new vaccine and Jiminy crickets.
[00:14:06.876 --> 00:14:15.516]  They just so have one ready that's coming out September 15th. Nailing the day I was told
[00:14:15.516 --> 00:14:21.596]  the new shot rolls out, the TSA puts the mask back on, the airport workers put them back on.
[00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:28.796]  And then as soon as that dropped, the headlines rolled. New York announces all the hospitals to
[00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:36.636]  make everyone wear masks starting next week. So you didn't have to wait.
[00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:45.815]  For a few weeks or a month to see if I was right about this. You've seen it in real time
[00:14:45.815 --> 00:14:51.115]  happening. So I'm going to talk about this some when we come back. But I want to give
[00:14:51.115 --> 00:14:59.135]  you the big news. What's this really connected to and how this is working. Because they didn't
[00:14:59.135 --> 00:15:03.095]  have the big deaths in 2000 so they called all flu illness and death. Remember there's
[00:15:03.095 --> 00:15:07.975]  like zero flu all over the world. It was COVID they claimed. This time they've got record
[00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:15.935]  deaths and I had mainstream news in the US, Canada and in the UK and in Germany all reporting
[00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:23.955]  record deaths and they say we don't know why all these people are dying. Well the
[00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:33.235]  hell you don't. You know exactly what's going on. So all these deaths start up and then
[00:15:33.235 --> 00:15:37.835]  they say oh it's the new COVID when it's the people that have taken the shot and we
[00:15:37.835 --> 00:15:41.715]  have the studies on it. So we got a good chance of beating this folks. We're not going
[00:15:41.715 --> 00:15:44.635]  to be caught flat footed this time. We got to take this very serious. So however
[00:15:44.635 --> 00:15:48.495]  you're tuned in right now on radio, on TV, on internet tell everybody else you know
[00:15:48.495 --> 00:15:54.255]  tune in now to mfoawars.com forward slash show because we are taking the global it's

[00:15:58.175 --> 00:16:04.975]  Coffee has not been available at mfoawarsstore.com for two years because the price went up too
[00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:10.015]  high and the quality was starting to go down. I turned out so many other producers that
[00:16:10.015 --> 00:16:13.575]  wanted to partner with us but when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I
[00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:18.215]  began to try their coffees I was blown away we finally have three great coffees that are
[00:16:18.215 --> 00:16:22.175]  the best they have to offer available to you right now. This is the best coffee
[00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:26.615]  I've ever tasted it smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever
[00:16:26.615 --> 00:16:32.095]  drank. Ladies and gentlemen these three single source Colombian coffees are now available

[00:19:03.655 --> 00:19:07.495]  a lot of power but they can be defeated but some of their operations are going to take

[00:19:48.135 --> 00:19:52.295]  procrastinate this is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives and stop the
[00:19:52.295 --> 00:19:56.615]  globalists from hitting us with poison that they allow in the water supply in some cases they
[00:19:56.615 --> 00:20:04.775]  add the water supply like fluoride leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[00:20:04.775 --> 00:20:08.535]  order it's Alex Jones
[00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:22.390]  If we work together, my friends, we can stop the new rollout of lockdowns.
[00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.010]  The UN has said they want new lockdowns just a few months ago.
[00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.790]  On Wednesday, the Russian government came out and released a list of U.S. bioweapon
[00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:35.830]  labs in Ukraine that are confirmed to be bioweapon labs now by the U.S. Ambassador to the EU,
[00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.830]  Victoria Nuland.
[00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:43.890]  And they said, we believe the West to bring in COVID lockdowns again is preparing to release
[00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:44.890]  a new virus.
[00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.610]  And I said, I don't know if that's the plan.
[00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:47.610]  That was on Wednesday.
[00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:53.410]  Then I get the call, I confirm that the feds high level are being told this is coming
[00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.410]  back out.
[00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:59.510]  Then five, six hours later, they roll out a PR campaign they already had pre-programmed
[00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.430]  saying indeed that's the case.
[00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:04.650]  We're going to go through some of those clips and cover those news articles.
[00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.850]  But two big things here.
[00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.530]  This is not an entertainment show.
[00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:13.050]  This is not where your spectators, you know, drinking Bud Light, eating popcorn,
[00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.230]  watching a baseball game or basketball game.
[00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.450]  This is the real world.
[00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.090]  And you got excited.
[00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.970]  You got upset about this on the Friday show.
[00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.250]  And you made sure our article and our videos and our reports went out everywhere.
[00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:30.210]  And when I say 30 million people watched at least 30 minutes of my show, that's the
[00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.370]  numbers we've collated is 30 million.
[00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.490]  That's where I spot checked the different platforms.
[00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.490]  And one on Instagram had 16 million views before they took it down.
[00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.050]  So it's really higher than that.
[00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.530]  There's at least 15 million views on Twitter right now.
[00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.090]  One has 7.5 million views.
[00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.810]  We're talking not just a five minute clip, we're talking 30 minute clips where I had
[00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.510]  time to really lay all this out to people.
[00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.330]  And that's what they don't like is when I can get a full communication out to people
[00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.090]  and show them what I was actually getting into, not just something out of context.
[00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:07.370]  So everybody needs to go to mfoawars.com forward slash show.
[00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.610]  We don't normally have technical issues with so much traffic coming to the site right
[00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:11.610]  now.
[00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:12.610]  It's locked up.
[00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.610]  It's still working.
[00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.970]  But we can't post new articles the last five hours and we can't get show headlines
[00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:18.970]  up for you to share.
[00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:24.570]  But you can still go to mfoawars.com forward slash show and share that link.
[00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.410]  Because when you get excited and you get focused and you take action, instead of reacting
[00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.730]  to the globalist like we're in the bleachers, you can be on the field politically, culturally,
[00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.590]  spiritually, economically, and we can beat them.
[00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:40.690]  And we're not going to let them launch masks on our kids again and not let people
[00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.210]  see their families in the hospital and killing them with ventilators and blocking
[00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:50.210]  therapeutics and pushing poison shots without us in the streets in opposition.
[00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.210]  And I'm going to be protesting, I'm going to be bullhorning, I'm going to be calling
[00:22:54.210 --> 00:23:00.810]  for rallies all across the country ahead of this, if they continue the rollout exactly
[00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.090]  as I was told they would do it.
[00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.889]  I told you mid September, they're going to announce hysteria.
[00:23:06.889 --> 00:23:09.050]  And I didn't even know they had the new variant shot ready.
[00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.730]  They didn't announce it till Friday night.
[00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:16.130]  People are like, whoa, he said September 15th and they just announced September 15th.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:26.400]  So, this is a big deal, I got a big guest coming on who's on the ground in Lahaina, Maui, it's
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.720]  worse than we thought, and we got Sunday Night Live with Harrison Smith coming up, or is
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:38.400]  it Owen DeKnight, I'm not sure, 6pm Central, it's Owen Schroyer, but then on my show tomorrow.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:46.040]  We're going to be opening the phones up, and I'm going to ask Harrison to do this too,
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:53.040]  for TSA workers, for border patrol, for ICE people, for hospital staff, hospital administrators,
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.240]  to call in with what they're hearing, because I have the stacks of news, I'm going to show
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:03.180]  them to you here next segment, where Hospitals Friday announced, hey New York, we're going
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:08.360]  back to Mass next week, and I've got it all here, so let me tell you, what I was
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:16.240]  told by the border patrol, and by the TSA, happened, I was talking to a very respected
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.840]  talk show host this morning, and he said, look, I believe, Alex, that you were told
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.700]  this, but it's hard to believe they're going to try it again, do you think these people
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:29.500]  are planning this info on you? I've known this person that works for the TSA for
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.460]  a long time, I'll leave it at that, more than a decade, and they've only given me
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.840]  a few pieces of info, I just know them through family connections, I'm going to leave
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.220]  it at that, they're just wanting me to know they're upset about it. The border patrol
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.640]  connection I've known about four years, great person, get on, I called them, they
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:51.160]  said, yeah, we were told similar things, so they're being told this, does that mean
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.120]  they're going to do it? I don't know, we're going to try to stop it together.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.400]  The future's uncertain. We don't just sit here and respond to what the globalists
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:07.400]  do, like jellyfish, we have arms and legs and brains and bones and guts and souls, and
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.160]  we don't have to sit here and let them, oh, it's scary, oh, wear the mask, you
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.720]  know, they're canceling public events, oh, the kids got to wear them again, oh, there's
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:20.120]  a new shot, oh, you got to show your vaccine passport to get into Walmart, and whether
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.320]  it's Whole Foods or these other big stores, they're all this month, putting hand
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:31.080]  scanners in to be able to get in and even use the place, not just buy, and major chains,
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.960]  major fast food chains announced, they're about to make you scan to buy and sell.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:41.880]  And this is all about the cashless society, it's all about the control grid.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:48.140]  So this is their agenda, they want to change the situation from Fauci and criminal referrals
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:54.420]  by the Senate for gain of function and all the lawsuits against the EcoHealth Alliance
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.280]  and the Wuhan lab and all the lawsuits against Bill Gates and everything's coming out.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.720]  They want to change the subject, go into next year and have mail-in ballots in swing
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.720]  states.
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.360]  A lot of people say, well, red states will never put up with this.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.100]  A lot of red states did, like Texas for a while.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.160]  But yes, I don't think we'll have 60% compliance like we had last time.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.980]  I think it'll be 20 or 30.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.820]  But that's in the key swing states for the mail-in ballots that allows them this
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.980]  fraud and how they win.
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:30.100]  So here's the ace in the hole, tomorrow I'm gonna start the show and I'm gonna open
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:39.920]  it up just for callers that are medical workers, TSA, state workers, health department workers,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.180]  anyone that has witnessed what we're talking about or if you've not heard it, we don't
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.960]  screen your calls and tell us who you are.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:51.200]  But then if you want, we've done this many times, after you're a caller, give us
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.380]  your name and number and then all we need to do is in a FaceTime so there's no record
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:04.240]  of it here or on a Zoom, we will look at your ID, we will confirm who you are and then we'll
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.080]  use you as a whistleblower for another big story.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.780]  And I have a sneaking suspicion, in fact I know what's gonna happen tomorrow because
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.840]  I have the articles where it's already happening.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.160]  I don't need you to, I want you to call in, I thank you for calling in, I don't
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.920]  need you to tell us because we already have them saying hospitals are going back to mask.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.180]  We already have all this.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.240]  People need to hear from you so we know what areas it's happening so we can build a mental
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.280]  map of what's going down and track this because this will starve the third world to
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.160]  death, it'll wreck the economy here, it'll explode crime, depression, suicide, hurts
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.040]  our children, the mask, the bacterial pneumonia, all of it and all the new poison shots
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:50.760]  but the key, when we come back, is I have the BBC, in fact I forgot to print that
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:57.260]  one, the BBC headline, unexplained deaths, record deaths, BBC, I have CBC, I have the
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:02.940]  German news, I have the US news, I have them all, the British news, all reporting
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:09.620]  on record level deaths, charting the insurance actuaries and they say we don't know why
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.500]  it's happening and why is this important?
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.900]  Because they're going to and they already are attributing it to COVID even though it's
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.560]  mainly the people that have taken the shots that are getting sick and dying so
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.740]  I'll explain how it all works, we've really got their number when we come
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:33.440]  back but this is life and death stuff, tomorrow 11 a.m. central my show starts
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.620]  and I never tell the shows what to cover because I'd hire people, I respect
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.960]  them, they do a great job but I'm gonna call Harrison Smith when I get off
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.000]  tonight I'm gonna say Harrison I don't care what guest you got tomorrow, scrap
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.880]  them, I want three hours American Journal 8 a.m. central taking calls on the humet
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.920]  the human intelligence of the people what they're seeing and hearing, I'll do
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:00.020]  the same thing and then Owen will tomorrow, this is gonna be big, a lot of
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.420]  listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high-quality
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.980]  coffee has not been available and that's because the prices went up too
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.780]  high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some, I turned down

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.880]  certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:11.220]  atmosphere, the surrounding communities began to get sick, laws were enacted to
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.060]  compel these corporations to install scrubbers, to convert these gases into
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:21.620]  fluorescelic acid, still highly toxic but containable, now these companies had
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.940]  a stockpile of this poison and there was no affordable way to dispose of it
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:30.300]  lucky for them one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.140]  the Treasury who was responsible for the Public Health Service at the time
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:40.280]  and by 1950 the US government began buying this toxic untreated industrial
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:44.760]  waste product and dumping it into our drinking water, reputable studies show
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.120]  that it's causing various cancers and other disease, with the Alexa Pure Pro

[00:33:28.179 --> 00:33:33.780]  I want to be 100% clear to all the viewers and all the listeners that tuned in Friday
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.780]  and took action.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.820]  We broke this major story about Biden and the globalist plan to roll out new lockdowns.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:43.540]  Incrementally, starting with masks and then from there, the attempt to force injections
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.540]  again.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.740]  It's not just that we've had over 30 million views in my report, conservatively, Friday,
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.979]  and then it's the number one story out there, drudge, you name it.
[00:33:55.979 --> 00:34:03.139]  It's that everywhere the feeds are filled with people remembering folks getting tasered
[00:34:03.139 --> 00:34:08.100]  or beat up for not wearing masks in the US, Australia, Germany, you name it, Canada,
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.500]  horses running over men, women, and children, truckers being arrested for protesting two
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.020]  years of lockdowns in Canada.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:20.940]  People are remembering the abuse they went through and what the deep state did and saying,
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.100]  not only are we not going to put up the new lockdowns and your new tyranny, we are
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.299]  going to make sure you get prosecuted and any politicians that support an attempt at
[00:34:29.299 --> 00:34:34.980]  this new rollout of tyranny are going to be removed from office.
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:41.839]  So folks are doing a splendid job and I've told my crew and I've told my other hosts,
[00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:50.140]  we need to go maximum coverage of this because I didn't know what I learned this Thursday
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:54.900]  and I reported Friday that they would launch it that afternoon with all the propaganda
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.819]  that, oh, it's a deadly variant, we may need masks again in lockdowns and just BBC
[00:34:58.819 --> 00:35:02.779]  and AP and Reuters and New York Times, I mean, I've got, I don't want to subject
[00:35:02.779 --> 00:35:06.940]  you to all these newscasts, you can turn on any television and see them, but I have dozens
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:12.740]  of articles and dozens of clips of them in the last two days.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.940]  So what my sources told me is already confirmed, they're trying.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:22.859]  People are like, but it's unpopular, it's insane, they've been discredited.
[00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:30.029]  My wife went to the grocery store this morning and she came back and she said, oh my gosh,
[00:35:30.029 --> 00:35:34.870]  a third of the people were wearing masks. You might see one person when you went to a crowded
[00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:39.350]  grocery store in Texas, in Austin, before this, in the last six months, a year, she
[00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:45.709]  said no, there was masks everywhere. The propaganda has been flipped on like a light
[00:35:45.709 --> 00:35:49.629]  switch. Remember who ran the propaganda? The defense ministries of all the major Western
[00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:55.609]  governments took the orders from the UN. I played the clips, played them again last week, where
[00:35:55.609 --> 00:36:01.569]  the UN ran big tech and our government and military response. The UN didn't come in blue
[00:36:01.569 --> 00:36:05.890]  helmets folks, they're in control of the federal response. Does that mean the average
[00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:10.330]  federal officer or agent is our enemy? Absolutely not, they're as pissed as we are.
[00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:16.970]  They're not stupid. The persecution of Trump is specialized teams. There's only two teams
[00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:24.350]  going after him, two federal teams out of hundreds. It's the same thing, selected crazy
[00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:33.629]  jurisdictions like DC and Atlanta and Manhattan. And I'm not here kissing the Feds ass, they
[00:36:33.629 --> 00:36:38.549]  want us to have a civil war. I'm just simply stating the Feds are just like us in a country
[00:36:38.549 --> 00:36:43.870]  captured by this tyranny. They want us to have a civil war, they're not our enemies.
[00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:48.830]  It's the Feds that are giving us the documents on the human trafficking. It's the Feds telling
[00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:55.290]  us the new lockdowns are coming, the good ones. And some of these are extremely senior.
[00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:59.410]  I haven't reached out to my most senior federal contact. I'm going to do that tomorrow
[00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:04.250]  but that can't be done over my phone, that has to be done from another location.
[00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.689]  We have to go through a lot of stuff to do this stuff. This is serious business
[00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:13.109]  folks. This is serious business. And I want listeners to realize how serious this is.
[00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:19.910]  They estimate, and I've got the UN food chief admitting it, that 80 plus million people
[00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:23.589]  during the lockdown starve to death in the last three and a half years. That's on top of the
[00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:27.830]  15 million that die here on average. That's 80 million people that starve to death folks.
[00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.229]  They do new lockdowns, they'll be mild here because we're the free home of the
[00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:37.509]  brave. As bad as we are, we're the best house in a bad neighborhood. But they do this
[00:37:37.509 --> 00:37:43.689]  in the third world. Man, it's mass murder. It's just insane. Not just the suicides here,
[00:37:43.689 --> 00:37:47.410]  not just the old people getting killed on ventilators, and not just the therapeutics
[00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:51.930]  being denied and, you know, millions die. We're talking about tens upon tens upon
[00:37:51.930 --> 00:38:00.330]  tens upon tens upon tens of millions of people. That's how evil the globalists are.
[00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:06.729]  Wait till you learn the developments next hour from Maui as a microcosm of this.
[00:38:06.729 --> 00:38:14.049]  So I want to get to how the PSYOP works. And I predicted this three years ago,
[00:38:14.049 --> 00:38:16.390]  but it unfortunately happened just like I knew the enemy was doing it.
[00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.950]  Because I've got their number. That's all I do is study them.
[00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:22.910]  Eat, drink, sleep, dream. That's all I do.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:30.060]  We know what they're going to pull. They've already pulled it. And I want to explain it
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:37.860]  coming up in a moment. But since I said I'd show you, let's go ahead and do it. I'm going
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:44.860]  to show you some news headlines and a couple of clips of the dozens of the absolute fear-mongering
[00:38:45.759 --> 00:38:50.360]  that started Friday night ahead of the magic new shot that I didn't even know they had
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.840]  ready. It didn't announce until Friday. Oh, don't worry, the virus is deadly. It's horrible.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.620]  It's really bad. Hospitalization is up 60%. But don't worry, we've got a new shot in the
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.279]  middle of September.
[00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:12.370]  What was the TSA told? Your mask go back in September 15th. Were the new protocols
[00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:21.450]  you'll have next week. War Patrol told middle of September, new protocols. All the newscasts
[00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:27.089]  say September 15th. We caught them with their pants down. They already had their script
[00:39:27.089 --> 00:39:34.649]  out. They already had it battle planned. I'm just irritated with myself that I was contacted
[00:39:34.649 --> 00:39:39.770]  Tuesday and didn't get back with them until Thursday because I'm just so overwhelmed and
[00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.970]  I'm not complaining. I feel guilty actually that I wasn't on this earlier, but it was
[00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:48.009]  the Lord works mysterious ways because we caught them five, six hours before they
[00:39:48.009 --> 00:39:54.210]  did it and the people went, what the hell? He just said it and they just did it. There's
[00:39:54.210 --> 00:40:02.730]  no way people are too awake. No. And it was like, boom. They're like, whoa. Yep. New York
[00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:08.410]  hospital reinstates, mass mandates. It's on folks. So let's go to one of the clips. Go
[00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:15.450]  to clip 40. Yeah. There's 50 something clips here. Let's go to clip 40 with a few of
[00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:23.609]  these newscasts across the U S with hospitalizations up 60% in the last month, according to the
[00:40:23.609 --> 00:40:31.210]  CDC, CBS is arrow Barnett on what's behind the summer increase. COVID didn't take a
[00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:37.370]  summer vacation. I do expect the numbers to go up a little bit more just because there's
[00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:42.890]  been a lot of activity. Dr. Bernard Caymans is the medical director for infection prevention
[00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:48.730]  at Mount Sinai. We are traveling. A lot of families are on vacation. And so it's
[00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:54.850]  COVID numbers are rising again. How concerned are you about that? It's not a cost for a
[00:40:54.850 --> 00:41:00.609]  long time. I think it's important for us to just pay attention, especially those
[00:41:00.609 --> 00:41:06.649]  who are at risk for hospitalizations or deaths from COVID. The highest risk groups
[00:41:06.649 --> 00:41:12.689]  for severe illness from respiratory viruses like COVID include the elderly, young children,
[00:41:12.689 --> 00:41:17.730]  people who are immunocompromised and pregnant women for people considering a COVID shot.
[00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:23.569]  Do you recommend they wait? Yes, I do think that the best thing to do is to wait until
[00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:29.730]  the new booster is available. Vaccines for other viruses like the flu are available
[00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:36.569]  now. The new COVID booster could be available as early as. Oh, they cut the clip as mid
[00:41:36.569 --> 00:41:40.529]  September. Guys, I don't know why that got cut off. But that's in the clip. Let's
[00:41:40.529 --> 00:41:44.710]  play another clip here. And notice just like three and a half years ago, oh, it's not
[00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.750]  a big thing. Just be ready. They're getting your confidence now. They're rolling it out.
[00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:55.109]  Let's go ahead and play clip one. Media and Sinus Unleash New COVID-19 Fear Campaign.
[00:41:55.109 --> 00:42:00.549]  Here it is. COVID is making a comeback this summer, so many of us would like to leave it
[00:42:00.549 --> 00:42:06.149]  in the past. But cases are once again on the rise. So when will new booster shots roll out?
[00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:12.390]  Anne Thompson asked the CDC director. This summer, most Americans left COVID in the
[00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:18.950]  past, gathering together once again, mask free. But tonight signs of a COVID resurgence
[00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:24.710]  across the country. COVID hospitalizations jumped more than 14% in the most recent week,
[00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:31.029]  but far lower than pandemic levels. NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel.
[00:42:31.029 --> 00:42:35.990]  What's behind this uptick in COVID that we're seeing? The main driver of this
[00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:41.109]  is a variant that's relatively newer to the scene, EG5. It's easier to give and get.
[00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:46.470]  So that makes it kind of easier to pass along. It's been almost a year since the last COVID
[00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:52.629]  booster came out. CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen. The new COVID booster is expected to be approved
[00:42:52.629 --> 00:42:56.390]  by the FDA and then we will make recommendations from the CDC probably by the
[00:42:56.390 --> 00:43:01.990]  second or third week of September. Will it protect against this new strain? Yes. The booster is
[00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:07.589]  tailored to what we are seeing circulating now. Critics say the federal government is behind
[00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:13.430]  once again. People knew there was going to be a COVID resurgence. So why don't we have a booster
[00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:17.669]  today? Why do we have to wait until next month? The way we go about doing our, just like
[00:43:17.669 --> 00:43:21.029]  we do with our flu shots, right? We make sure that we're looking at the ways in which the
[00:43:21.029 --> 00:43:26.549]  virus changed. They look at and evaluate that the FDA is doing its work. We likely will see
[00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:33.109]  this as an annual COVID shot, just like the flu shot. Just in time for fall when we'll also
[00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:40.390]  face RSV. Can you take the flu shot, the COVID booster and the RSV vaccine all at once? So for
[00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:45.750]  flu and COVID, yes. RSV again is only available for older adults. That's one where I'd say talk
[00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:52.069]  to your doctor about what's right for you. So until the new COVID booster comes, get prepared.
[00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:57.189]  Stock up on at-home tests. They do cover that new strain. Keep a mask handy in case you're in
[00:43:57.189 --> 00:44:03.509]  a crowded place. And most of all, get your shots. COVID, flu, and RSV all by Halloween
[00:44:03.509 --> 00:44:08.629]  to give yourself your best chance of staying healthy. A reminder that COVID never went away.
[00:44:11.509 --> 00:44:15.830]  So what did my sources tell me that I told you Friday before all this aired?
[00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.870]  Friday night and Saturday. We have more clips, more articles.
[00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:28.470]  Middle of September, federal workers, TSA, airports, mask go back. Then by the middle of October,
[00:44:29.029 --> 00:44:32.549]  everybody has to wear the mask. They look for a presidential order,
[00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:37.750]  and then it just continues on from there. They're going to see what we'll put up with,
[00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:42.149]  but I'm going to give you the rest of the story. It's so critical here in just a moment,
[00:44:42.149 --> 00:44:45.750]  but let me go ahead then and just show you some of the fear-mongering headlines.
[00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:53.270]  Here comes the real deal. Scientists raise alarm over new COVID variant amid call for return of
[00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:58.870]  face mask, Daily Mail. And I've got it in the US news, all of them, same thing. Gloomy,
[00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:03.750]  scientists call for people to start wearing COVID mask again as they sound alarm over new
[00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:11.189]  COVID BA6 that has a lot of new mutations. See? Scientists call for Brits to wear masks
[00:45:11.189 --> 00:45:19.189]  again due to startling new COVID variant. New COVID variant. Eris has scientists
[00:45:19.189 --> 00:45:24.710]  demanding mask return. Urgent COVID warnings. Experts call for public to wear mask again
[00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:34.310]  if they're wearing new strain. So within hours of me reporting this,
[00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:40.950]  they had their rollout already ready. New ministry COVID strain sees experts call
[00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:54.069]  to plunge Britain back into restrictions. Boom. So is Alex Jones right? Yeah, they're trying it
[00:45:54.069 --> 00:46:01.189]  again. I'm not making this up. And I'd rather have people attack me in a month or two,
[00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.830]  be back to us and say, well, it didn't happen. Jones lied to us. No, I said,
[00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.790]  they're trying it. We need to stop them. Now, let me give you
[00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:14.149]  the rest of the story, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:16.629 --> 00:46:19.509]  And boy, is it the rest of the story. You see this stack?
[00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.790]  This is life and death stuff right here. This is so important. Please pay attention.
[00:46:25.509 --> 00:46:43.990]  This is the Globe and Mail. The BBC. The Express News. The CBC. And that's the real
[00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.549]  globalist controlled countries where they launch it first, England and Canada.
[00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:54.629]  And what do they say? More people than expected are dying in Canada in 2023 for reasons that
[00:46:54.629 --> 00:47:02.950]  are not yet clear. The worst death numbers in 50 years. Insurance actuary numbers show worse than
[00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:11.990]  2020. Excess deaths in 2022 are among the worst in 50 years. BBC.
[00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.629]  It's the same numbers we gave you a year ago for the insurance companies.
[00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:23.430]  Some 5% death increase on average is about 12.
[00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:29.589]  Usually you have up one point down a half a point. You know, it varies. No,
[00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:33.109]  the live expectancy is plunging. It's all happening after you took all the shots.
[00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:40.149]  Experts call for urgent investigations. As excess deaths sparked dangerous theories.
[00:47:40.370 --> 00:48:10.370]  The Express of the UK newspaper. An urgent investigation is needed into why excess deaths are near pandemic levels. Because the lack of explanation is fueling wild and dangerous theories. Government figures suggest the number of extra unnecessary fatalities this year is an all-time high in particular. And it goes on the 15 to 44 age group. Meanwhile, we've got all these studies.
[00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:31.370]  New study proves Pfizer vaccine causes turbo cancer in rats. Rutgers said to disenroll students on August 15th if not compliant with COVID vaccine mandates. Remember these young cycles from a single Belgian teen who were suddenly afflicted with severe heart problems shortly after receiving the COVID vaccine.
[00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:38.370]  And it goes on and on and on. Interesting cartoon that shows the devil talking to one of his demons.
[00:48:41.370 --> 00:49:05.370]  Folding in the new year. Evil plans for 2023? The demon asks the devil. The devil hands him a mask and says, oh, let's just do 2020 again. I think that says it all. And I got Bill Gates telling you, oh, the next leg will be even worse.
[00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:18.370]  So here's how it works. They call all the flu deaths in 2020, 2021. There was no flu in the world, they said. We're preposterous. Remember that? They said, oh, it's COVID.
[00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:30.370]  Then you take the shots starting in 2021 and death rates, show the graphs, go straight up. And now there's all this death in the people that have had their immune systems destroyed and have been taking these shots.
[00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:44.370]  And in the studies, it's almost all the vaccinated. And they turn around and say, oh, it's COVID's really bad. We got record deaths. You need to take more of the shots they admit. Don't protect you and erase your immune system.
[00:49:45.370 --> 00:50:01.370]  I played the clip on Friday, try to dig it up again, of Biden twice, but also the different leaders around the world, New Zealand, Germany, you name it, saying, if you take the shot, you cannot get COVID or spread COVID.
[00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:12.370]  That was when they've been given the shots for six months. They know it made you more sick. Studies show it makes you more sick, destroys your immune system, makes you get COVID in many cases.
[00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:24.370]  And then Biden blamed the unvaccinated for the problems that were having. But we know that's not the case. If you have normal immunity to anything, you're bulletproof.
[00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:42.370]  But they told you that didn't exist. We played it on Friday. It's two clips. Biden says, if you've had the COVID shot, you're protected. You can't get COVID. You can't share COVID. You've got Rachel Maddow saying it. You've all seen the clips. Let me know when you get it. Okay, guys?
[00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:53.370]  No, that's not it. That's the compilation of him blaming people that haven't had the shots.
[00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:56.550]  It doesn't matter. We'll play it next hour, but I got another subject next hour. I know
[00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:03.470]  I sprung that on you. We played it Friday. Yeah, I think that's it. That's it. Okay,
[00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:08.310]  get the audio piped in and play the clip. Here it is.
[00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:13.870]  For most Americans, one COVID shot each year will be all they need. And if you get it,
[00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:19.430]  you're protected. And if you don't, you're putting yourself and other people on necessary
[00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.430]  risk. The shot is free.
[00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:25.630]  We've got all these other clips. What we played Friday was three clips, two of him
[00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:29.830]  saying it and Jacinda Ardern's. See me in Friday. I don't want to, I'm not like
[00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:35.470]  mainstream media. I don't tell you something and then not show you. I want you to see
[00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:44.110]  it for yourselves. So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:51.990]  That's where we are. And this is a big, big, big deal. I've got a lot more on this
[00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:58.350]  that I haven't gotten into yet. And we will continue to cover it, but I want to cover
[00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:08.670]  again the other big leg of this. And that's these clips and these news articles everywhere
[00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:21.230]  that I'll show you right now of the head of the World Food Program saying, oh, we
[00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:25.550]  need all this money. We need all this human power. When I can play you and I'll
[00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.430]  do this tomorrow because I forgot to tell the crew to do it. Actually, I did and one of
[00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:33.510]  them forgot, but it's no big deal. Tomorrow at the start of the show, so the
[00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:39.790]  guy's got plenty of time, I want a compilation of John Kerry, the last six months all over
[00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:46.750]  the world. He did it again three weeks ago saying we need to cut food production
[00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:52.430]  all over the world to stop starvation and to stop global warming. So the diver doesn't
[00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:56.710]  have enough oxygen in their tank. We need to take the oxygen out of their tank, show they
[00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:05.990]  don't asphyxiate. Asphyxiate. That's not the word. Asphyxiate. I'm having a Jesse
[00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:17.510]  Jackson moment where I can't talk. Asphyxiate. How do you say it? Asphyxiate. Asphyxiate.
[00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:24.030]  You know, can't do it. Hey, just try going under water without oxygen, see how it does for you
[00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:29.110]  ladies and gentlemen. I'm turning to Joe Biden here. I mean, look, if people want to be
[00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:33.870]  killed by this, if this is what you want, knock yourselves out and enjoy yourselves, okay?
[00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:39.510]  But you will smother, you will die of lack of oxygen if you don't have oxygen. And it's
[00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:43.230]  the same thing here. They're cutting the food off worldwide.
[00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:56.910]  And then telling us that it's our fault and then blaming it on COVID and global warming.
[00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:02.270]  That's the plan. Collapse the world by 2030 and tell you while they administratively shut
[00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:08.830]  everything off, your power, energy, your food, your fertilizer, your police, everything,
[00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:15.150]  while they tell you and concentrate and transfer that power, that it's your fault. And it goes
[00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:28.470]  on and on and on and on and on. So I'm going to wait on the UN food director till tomorrow.
[00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:35.070]  Or maybe, maybe at the end of the next hour. Because here's the deal. They're all like
[00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:39.710]  30 minutes speeches by John Kerry. I don't want to play those here. Can somebody in there
[00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:44.550]  pull up John Kerry says shut down farms. John Kerry says shut down farms and stop global
[00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:50.190]  warming. And he actually says we've got to cut food production 30%. That's kind of powerful
[00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:55.870]  while they're already doing that. And then I have the UN food director on video
[00:54:55.870 --> 00:55:03.030]  and all the articles right here. United Nations food chief David Beasley warns that
[00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:10.310]  hell on earth food shortage will occur 2023. As a result of fertilizer shortages, the world
[00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:15.350]  produces enough food to feed everybody on the planet over 7.7 billion people. 50% of that
[00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:20.630]  food is because of fertilizer. So if you don't have fertilizer, you can't harvest and the yields
[00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:30.310]  that you need. This is like turning the oxygen off to somebody in a submarine. They know
[00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:38.630]  exactly what they're doing. And we better take it serious. Yeah, slashing farm emissions
[00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:44.310]  critical to fighting climate change. John Kerry says, we'll play the videos. They're on Twitter,
[00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:50.390]  we're going to do it. Because this is total war. And almost no one's covering it. Almost
[00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:57.590]  no one is taking it serious. And I'm tired of sitting here and watching him kill people
[00:55:57.590 --> 00:56:00.950]  administratively like will expose next hour has happened in Maui.
[00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:07.830]  It's all a test. It's all to see what they get away with. Because here's the
[00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:15.190]  Times of London headline. Billionaire Club in bid to curb overpopulation.
[00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:21.430]  And they say cut off the food and starve you. And then the UN, the very group doing it,
[00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:26.150]  comes out and says they're saving you. By the way, I can't fund this operation without
[00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:30.230]  your support your help. Plus, we've got great products you need with all the things happening

[00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:42.710]  cardiovascular system, your blood, and all the garbage that's out there in the environment

[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:54.820]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia, the
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:00.660]  insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy, you are crazy in my view if you

[00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:00.920]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.460]  industry to use.
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:05.800]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.620]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:15.040]  enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.

[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:56.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:18.140]  That's Alex Jones, the most band network in the world.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:24.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, I got a call yesterday, an individual was in town and they wanted
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:37.140]  to meet with me that I know well and they are a high level manager in the TSA and
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.140]  I went and met with them.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:48.740]  I had a cup of coffee with them and they said you got to warn people.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:56.660]  Tuesday we got called in, the managers, and told that by the middle of September that
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:00.899]  the new policy is being written, that this is done, they were told this is happening,
[01:01:00.899 --> 01:01:03.180]  this is not hypothetical.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:10.379]  You will all have to wear a mask again and so will airport employees.
[01:01:10.379 --> 01:01:19.759]  Then by the middle of October they are going to say that everyone flying has to wear a mask.
[01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:24.500]  And in the meetings people began to ask them, well I mean why is this happening?
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:31.540]  They said well because of the new variant in Canada and because of the WHO they may
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.819]  declare this, but regardless we've been told this is going to happen.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:02:04.120]  And then they were told, we expect by December, a return to the full COVID protocol of 2020-2021.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:14.120]  And I was given many more details, I wrote down notes on it.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:26.120]  Then I left, called the first federal connection that I was thinking of, didn't answer.
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:30.120]  Called the second, answered.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.120]  I told them what I've been told, and they said, what day was that? I said Tuesday.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:48.120]  They said, yep, we were told yesterday, yesterday was Thursday, so it was Wednesday, expect COVID protocols to begin rolling out middle of September.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120]  And I said, what else were you told?
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:03:00.120]  Basically that they believe this new variant is super bad and that they're doing the testing and that they should just get ready for a whole new roll out of what happened before.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:08.120]  And this was border patrol connected people I was talking to, and testing at the border again and the whole shooting match.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:16.120]  That's two federal agents that told me this yesterday.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:24.120]  And then I went and looked at the news, and there they were saying Canada's looking at new restrictions again because of the variant, and so is the EU.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:34.120]  And one of the Russians just put out three days ago, US is plotting another pandemic, Russian head of the defense ministry warns.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  Now, new lockdowns will starve the third world, new lockdowns will destroy small businesses, new lockdowns will take the average person that's already $5,000 in the hole,
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.120]  and their paycheck is just on time, will put them into full bankruptcy.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:04:04.120]  And the children in the mask and the attempt to push a new shot for the new variant, and we're right back in the same hellhole we were in just a few years ago.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.120]  And why is it perfect timing?
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:15.120]  Because going to the election year, they had the last crisis go over two and a half years, they'll bare minimum run this through the next election.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.120]  It's only 14, 15 months out with mail-in ballots again.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:29.120]  And we have all the eyewitnesses and testimony that they get the mail-in ballots, and in some cases they were 99% for Joe Biden.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120]  Who believes that?
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  US Postal Service whistleblowers, USPS, poll-watching witnesses, I have it all here, we'll play it next hour.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:48.120]  We do not have to sit here and take the same criminal UN global, WAF, new world order regimes, second rollout of lockdowns,
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:53.120]  and attempts at force injections and travel restrictions and being told you're not essential.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.120]  We don't have to lay down and die.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:04.120]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:13.120]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:18.120]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.

[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:09.120]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:45.120]  At the bottom of the hour, Real America's voice, Nick Sordore will be joining us from Lahaina, Mali.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:53.120]  He's there. He was on live Friday with Steve Bannon and trendy white liberals come over and say, you can't be here.
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.120]  You're not allowed to be here. Get out of here and try to kick the media out.
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.120]  We now have the mayor saying we're not going to talk about the missing kids. We're going to discuss it.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:07.120]  They found all these houses and melted cars full of whole families.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.120]  They are covering up what has really happened here.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:13.120]  That's why Biden isn't traveling there. It's why he won't talk about it.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:20.120]  It's now confirmed by hundreds of reports and videos that they didn't trim the trees around the power lines.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.120]  They let the power lines on. They fell. They started the fire. The high wind burned the town down.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:35.120]  Now the head of the water district who works for Obama and his foundation admits that they asked for water that day.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.120]  Wouldn't give it to them. Once the fire started, they then said, sure, you can have water now.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:44.120]  Kind of like two years ago when Texas had the power outage for two weeks and all those deaths and everything.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:50.120]  And the feds wouldn't allow Texas to up its power output. People blame the state. The state's under federal control.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.120]  I think the state should say no and pass the law and say they're not following it.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:08:00.120]  So this is administrative mass murder. Now, Jason Jones is a filmmaker, activist, reporter, traveled all over the world.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:06.120]  People know him well here. He has been in Maui for three days. He has been down to that area.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:12.120]  He's talked to locals. And he's joining us to give us the latest. Because this, you can say, well, that's just Lahaina.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:21.120]  That's just Hawaii. We have BlackRock that owned the power company, admitting for four or five years they haven't updated the power lines or cut anything.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:28.120]  They say we're not investing in old energy. So they did this. They didn't turn the sirens on.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.120]  They've tried to blockade coming in. So folks are bringing in boats and jet skis.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:40.120]  Jason Jones is involved in that. So he joined us Friday, joined us Thursday to give us an update on what he has witnessed.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.120]  He joins us now. Jason Jones.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:45.120]  Alex, good to see you. Great to be back on your show.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.120]  So give us the down low. What's actually happening?
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:52.120]  Well, first of all, I want to share this with you, Alex. You can judge a man by his friends.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.120]  And your audience responded like nothing I have ever seen.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:09.120]  After being on your show, they went to HopeForHawaii.com and donated so much money that we're going to do two more charter flights this week filled with life-saving necessities that the people of Lahaina need.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:15.120]  And you see, this is some of the goods we brought by boat and then jet ski and then a bucket brigade to the trucks.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:22.120]  The people of Lahaina, the people of Maui, the people of the Hawaiian Islands have taken the lead of caring for each other.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:30.120]  You know, I've had a privilege in my life to be a part of a lot of beautiful things. But as we say in Hawaii, this gives me chicken skin.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:42.120]  I've never seen anything so beautiful as boats coming from all of the outer islands, dropping anchor, and then you have a bucket brigade of jet skis bringing it to the bucket brigade of people on the beach.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.120]  And that's because they're blocking the roads still in a 12-mile exclusion zone.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.120]  So I know you're having to work there. You're being diplomatic. But let's talk about what's really going on now.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:56.120]  Yeah, I'm going to tell you what I think, Alex. First of all, there are a lot of theories, right?
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:04.120]  The fires were either started by a lightning strike or man-made. And if they were man-made, it was either an accident or it was intentional.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:11.120]  Then the response was either great or there was nothing they could have done or there were mistakes made.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:23.120]  I believe, Alex, first of all, on the ground, I've talked to a lot of people. All the theories you see online, you can hear people sharing who are locals on the ground.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:32.120]  Personally, what I believe is that this was caused by a downed electric line. You see Hawaiian Electric. This is just my belief.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:40.120]  It's not your belief. I have a 45-minute clip put out by a local internet group that has cameras all over the town. You see them falling in the fire. It's happening.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:48.120]  That's right. And now the Wall Street Journal has reported that Hawaiian Electric is beginning to reorganize to protect themselves from liability.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:55.120]  You know, then you have the response. So here's the thing. The emergency management director has resigned.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:04.120]  He's given several reasons why. Can you imagine, he said it was hell, resigning the day after this one of the greatest catastrophes in American history.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:12.120]  Really two years to the month, almost two years to the day, of the greatest military catastrophe in U.S. history.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.120]  The debacle, the one we pulled out of Afghanistan that led to 20 million Afghans living in severe hunger.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.120]  Now we have one of the most beautiful, beloved communities in the world, the community of Lahaina.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:30.120]  And we know, here's what we know, Alex. There was a fire. We know that the casualties are much higher than the reporting.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:38.120]  There's over a thousand people missing still. Locals on the ground have reported that they already can give names to 580 of the missing people.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.120]  And then we have the government doing nothing but dissembling.
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:49.120]  What my hope is, Alex, and why I'm so grateful to be on your show again, is that regardless of how the fires were started,
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:54.120]  regardless of how the government responded, we know what the great threat is.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:06.120]  And the great threat is vultures like Black Rock are descending upon Lahaina and they are preying on a people in the wake of an unbelievable catastrophe.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.120]  Alex, can I tell you what? I've been in war zones. I just got back from Ukraine.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:19.120]  I saw some of the saddest sights. My team and I, as we were driving through this burned-out town that looked like a tactical nuclear bomb went off,
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:27.120]  there was a woman walking through the wreckage alone, crying, looking bewildered, dazed and confused.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:36.120]  When we were on the beach doing this bucket brigade, there were people smiling and laughing, and then you would notice intermittently people just breaking down and crying.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:41.120]  And I turned to my son and I said, these people are getting a moment of relief from great sorrow.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:51.120]  I said, son, we are surrounded by people who still have loved ones they lost and loved ones that are missing and loved ones that they know that they have lost.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:59.120]  It is really an unbelievable tragedy. And so here's my hope, Alex. Your audience started this hashtag, Keep Lahaina Local.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:07.120]  They started it. On Twitter, I saw countless, endless messages to Elon Musk.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:14.120]  We need to get that trending, Keep Lahaina Local. We need to stand with the locals. We need to care for those who are displaced.
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:22.120]  We need to bury the dead. That's something at the Vulnerable People Project that we're really committed to, to making sure that the dead are treated with respect.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.120]  And I think that's one of the best ways we can honor their families.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.120]  Jason, I agree. Ship the food and help the people. But the globalists that did this need to pay.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.120]  They didn't put on the sirens. They admit they didn't give them the water when the fire was already going.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.120]  They admit, yeah, we refuse the water. I think they had plenty of water.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:44.120]  This is insane. And then you have the power line flooded. We have hours of it falling down, fires everywhere.
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:49.120]  And then now they're trying to still keep the media out. We have a reporter coming on. They tried to kick out.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:57.120]  It wasn't some local. It was some libtard. They're clearly trying to cover something up and not saying where the children are.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.120]  Here is the mayor just yesterday being confronted. Here's the video.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:10.120]  Yes, you do. How many children are missing? You know the answer to that.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.120]  I would be happy to answer that. You have no estimate of how many children are missing?
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.120]  I guess we can end this right now.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.120]  This is one of the biggest questions that the people behind it have.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.120]  It always takes one or two to ruin it for everybody.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:30.120]  We can say that about you. You ruined it forever.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.120]  You're a disaster.
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:46.120]  So thousands of dead, you'd normally have them doing it. They're just saying no, no media stay out.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:50.120]  People have to deliver food by boat. It's obviously a cover up going on.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:54.120]  Yeah, and they won't address the question. How many children have died?
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:58.120]  Alex, for me, for the life of me, I can't understand it.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:05.120]  I cannot understand the dissembling, the gaslighting, the failure of the mainstream media to talk about this.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:11.120]  Look how Biden won't talk about it. He could be a hero.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:16.120]  We have the Wall Street Journal article. We even said it before they did. I'm not bragging.
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:21.120]  But the Wall Street Journal said no, BlackRock for five years did not update anything.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.120]  They said no more money into classic power.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.120]  Well, you've got the power lines. There's no new power. They're going to get trees are going to fall on them.
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.120]  We're going to skip this break, guys.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.120]  You're a producer. She must have thought I lost my mind.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:42.120]  But I'm sending her CNN and Wall Street Journal because they're saying what you were saying last week.
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.120]  So they're going to slowly bleed out the truth because they know if the American people,
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:53.120]  if the truth of this was presented to them at once, they would be overwhelmed with grief and the response would be unbelievable.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.120]  This is at the magnitude of 9-11.
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:16:00.120]  You take the population of Lahaina and you have over a thousand missing.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.120]  That is like over 800,000 New Yorkers gone missing after 9-11.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:10.120]  And yet the mainstream media is not treating this with the respect that they deserve.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:19.120]  People talk a lot. When I go all over the world and people know that I'm from Hawaii, they all share with how much they love Hawaii.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.120]  Well, if you love Hawaii, right now you'll stand with the people of Lahaina and you'll tell the truth.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:31.120]  And we will make sure that Lahaina stays for the kamaaina, that Lahaina stays for the Hawaiians, and that Lahaina stays local.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.120]  Because the dissembling to me is what's unbelievable.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:47.120]  Well, listen, people ask why I have so much empathy for people in Russia or Ukraine or Australia or New York City or San Francisco or Maui.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.120]  Because they're all under the same globalist attack, the same enemy's attack, and then they're coming for us next.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:58.120]  We've got to care about them but also study the enemy operation because they're getting ready to do it to us.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:04.120]  I watched Texas for two weeks and I saw the state five days before it sent a letter saying,
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:09.120]  let us up the power of the coal power plants and the gas plants. They said no.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:14.120]  And then we froze and people died and businesses were destroyed and houses flooded and it created hell.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:18.120]  So I've watched the administrative mass murder.
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:27.120]  And then anybody knows you've trimmed trees away from power lines and you turn the power off if you haven't when a hurricane comes through.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.120]  So they knew what they were doing or they were idiots hired to do it.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:38.120]  But I guarantee you BlackRock, when they say don't update power lines or cut power lines in California or Hawaii,
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:43.120]  those are the two states that are really doing it as a test, that's mass murder.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:49.120]  So I get you want to help the people, we are, and it's great, it's wonderful, and they need help, but it's us next.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:58.120]  So I'm saying we'll save the next 10 Mauis if we get criminal prosecutions of these people.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.120]  And if the feds aren't going to do it, we need the local government.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:11.120]  We need to be calling for criminal negligence charges and then the mayor and the head of the water district and the head of the power district, they're going to roll.
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.120]  I got a bunch of dead kids.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.120]  We got water turned off.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.120]  We got the electricity left on.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.120]  We got the trees not trimmed.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.120]  These people are criminally negligent.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.120]  I want them indicted now, Jason.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.120]  Now I'm with you, Alex Jones.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.120]  And, you know, here's the thing.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:34.120]  The green agenda will be deadlier than the reds in the 20th century.
[01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:46.120]  You know, national socialism began from poetry clubs in the late 19th century in Germany where they were dancing around the Maypole and trying to resurrect old German poetry.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:51.120]  And that led to organizations, as you know, the Thule Society, and from that you get the Nazi Party.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:19:01.120]  You know, it would be hard to believe in the 19th century if you saw a bunch of Germans reciting poetry, dancing around a Maypole, that this could lead to great catastrophe, World War and genocide.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:10.120]  Well, you know, when we were growing up in the 70s and 80s, it might have seemed absurd that environmentalism would lead to mass death.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.120]  But we see it with famine.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:21.120]  I work around the world where we're serving people on the margins, and we see it in using food for energy with ethanol.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:32.120]  They use staples like corn and sugar and the land that we can be growing food to feed people with to save, you know, to fight plant food that is carbon dioxide.
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.120]  We see this in Hawaii, and we saw this in Texas.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:41.120]  You're right that the green agenda has gone, it's gone berserk.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:48.120]  And to see that you can tell these people are drunk with ideology because they show no empathy.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.120]  It was embarrassing that I broke down crying on your show last time, Alex.
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:20:06.120]  But I got all these messages from your audience saying, isn't it strange that you broke down crying, but the mayor and the governor and all of the people responsible for this were smiling, were talking with authority and with no shame.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.120]  And I think what explains that?
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.120]  That's a really good point.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:14.120]  They're literally yards from barbecued families inside cars and houses, and I've seen all their press conferences.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.120]  They act like they're liking it, actually.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.120]  They're full of arrogance.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:22.120]  Yeah, Brian Schatz in one of the press conferences, they didn't let him speak.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:26.120]  He's our senator, and he built his career on this myth that he was a great savior of the environment.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:31.120]  You picking up cans around Punahou High School where Barack Obama went when he was a boy.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.120]  I remember when I was chairman of the College Republicans and I saw his stunts.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:39.120]  I said to my chapter, we're going to have to deal with Brian Schatz for the rest of our life.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:45.120]  I never realized how fast he would skip into a Senate seat, but he was there smiling the whole time.
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:51.120]  He seemed like he was smiling and then seemed like they were wasting his time, like he had somewhere else to be.
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:58.120]  I mean, Alex Jones, this is, to a state the size of Hawaii, to an island with the population of Maui.
[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.120]  This is like a city being blown off the map by the Russians.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.120]  Yeah, it is. It's gone.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:10.120]  We drove through there, and I was there with my diplomatic liaison from a Rome office, and I brought her here.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:20.120]  She works in Europe trying to resettle the Afghan allies that we've been hiding in safe houses in Afghanistan and Pakistan and trying to resettle.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:25.120]  I brought her here. We were together in Ukraine, and as we went through Lahaina,
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:30.120]  she said this is unlike anything we have seen wherever we have been in the world.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:36.120]  And when I was, by God's grace, I forgot a satellite phone, that we brought satellite phones to distribute to people,
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.120]  and I'd forgotten a satellite phone in my car.
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.120]  When we were getting ready to go back to the airport, I'm in Oahu now.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.120]  I'll be going back to Maui early this week.
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:47.120]  But I saw a family loading their car with so many, I saw them.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.120]  They were getting coffee, and their car was loaded with goods.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:51.120]  I said, excuse me, are you going to Lahaina?
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.120]  And they said yes.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.120]  They said, can I give you a satellite phone that you can give to the folks up there?
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:00.120]  And when I shared with them what they were doing, and I also said, please let folks know.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.120]  Here, we gave them our cards.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.120]  We're also willing to pay for funerals.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.120]  They began to cry, and they had lost family members.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.120]  Everyone we talked to says they had family members missing, or they lost family members.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.120]  So let's explain what's happening.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:15.120]  Disagree, disagree, I know you won't, this is the truth.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.120]  Thousands are dead.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.120]  There's hundreds and hundreds of cars barbecuing people inside of it.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.120]  They know they didn't trim the trees.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.120]  They know they left the power on.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.120]  They know they didn't give them the water.
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.120]  It's a perfect storm of evil.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.120]  It wasn't negligent.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.120]  It was policy.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:34.120]  For five years, BlackRock that bought this didn't trim the damn trees,
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.120]  saying, quote, we don't upgrade or fix evil infrastructure.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.120]  They used it as a weapon.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.120]  They knew this stuff was coming.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.120]  California's doing it as well in the poor areas.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.120]  They don't trim the trees.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.120]  And so they're just hoping we all forget and move on to the next story
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.120]  after they just killed all these people.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.120]  That's why they don't want media there.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120]  That's why they don't want this discussed.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.120]  That's why they don't want this talked about.
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.120]  It's two years since the collapse of Afghanistan,
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.120]  and I've been in Afghanistan for two years.
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:05.120]  I'm not leaving until the last SIV is safe with his family.
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.120]  We delivered three million meals to our Afghan allies, widows and orphans,
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.120]  who were killed in action.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.120]  Hawaii's my home.
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:13.120]  Yeah, this will never be swept under the rug.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.120]  I can promise you that.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.120]  And I thank you for sharing your audience.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.120]  We will never let this.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.120]  They picked the wrong place.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120]  They picked the wrong people.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.120]  If they think the Hawaiians, they think the Kamehameha.
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.120]  This is one thing.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.120]  I mean, you've seen Alex, and you have so many fans here,
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.120]  and you've seen the Instagrams from the Hawaiians.
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120]  They're not going to sweep this under the rug.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120]  But you made a good point.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.120]  Down the power lines.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.120]  You know how you know when you're in a community that the government
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.120]  doesn't care about or respect the first thing that you can see?
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.120]  And you see this, you know that the schools aren't getting
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.120]  the support that they need.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.120]  The roads aren't going to be paved the way they're supposed to be.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:51.120]  Well, how you know that is they have above-ground power lines.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.120]  These power lines in affluent neighborhoods would be underground.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.120]  They would be underground.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.120]  And if they had underground power lines,
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.120]  you wouldn't have had this fire.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.120]  And that's true not just in Hawaii, but that's true across the country.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.120]  You know that you're in a community that's-
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.120]  I remember being six years old and moving into a suburb of Dallas
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.120]  from Dallas with my dad.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.120]  And my dad had just bought this nice house.
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.120]  And he said, son, you know how this is a rich neighborhood?
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]  I'm like six years old.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.120]  I go, no, dad.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.120]  And he goes, you see those green boxes?
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.120]  The power lines are underground.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.120]  He goes, that stops fires.
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:29.120]  That's the future.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.120]  And it was just a weird statement my dad made
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.120]  that I was just thinking of when you said that.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:38.120]  Here's the footage that local cameras on houses got
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:41.120]  of the power lines falling and the fire starting.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.120]  So you were there.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.120]  You've been there the last few days.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.120]  You're saying, what is the sense to people?
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.120]  Because all I see in the videos is them saying,
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.120]  we know you stood down.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.120]  You didn't give us water.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:59.120]  You didn't turn on the emergency sirens.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.120]  You didn't cut the trees.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:03.120]  You killed us.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.120]  I agree with you.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.120]  I think they bit off more than they can chew here.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.120]  Yeah, they definitely bit off more than they can chew.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.120]  But I will say also the sense of the people is,
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.120]  you know, just they're bewildered.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.120]  As you can imagine, a community this small,
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.120]  they're just absolutely bewildered.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.120]  And so what I really hope to do
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:27.120]  with the Vulnerable People Project is unite the community
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:30.120]  around what will stop the goals of the globalists,
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.120]  which is to wipe not the city, the town off the map.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.120]  I'm sure they would have loved to have kept the town
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.120]  if they could have swept the people off the map.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.120]  But as you allowed me to say,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.120]  and I thank you for the second hour you gave me by myself,
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.120]  I got to talk in depth about what I really believe.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.120]  And I'll say this to the people of Hawaii.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:49.120]  What I really believe is that since GATT
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.120]  and since the mid-early 90s,
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.120]  when they closed agriculture,
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.120]  the industry that knit this community together,
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.120]  that gave people jobs and upward mobility,
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  when that was swept away,
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.120]  that was the beginning of trying to sweep the communities
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.120]  that the globalists created through the agriculture industry
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.120]  a hundred and some years ago
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.120]  when they overthrew the Kingdom of Hawaii
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:12.120]  and brought the Filipinos and the Chinese and the Okinawans
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.120]  and everyone, the haoles like me who came in the military
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.120]  and then we intermarried and had families
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.120]  and created a community.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.120]  They mean to slowly sweep everyone away,
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.120]  then they'll bring in a transient servant class
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.120]  and they can have it all to themselves.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:30.120]  But I believe that the Hawaiians should have Hawaii.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:32.120]  And I believe that the Kamaaina
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.120]  who intermarried with the Hawaiians
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.120]  and who were knit together over a hundred years
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.120]  to create the most unique and beloved community in the world
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.120]  should have, they should have,
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  this was knit together through the love
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.120]  and through intermarriages and through hard work.
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:49.120]  Yeah, they should be in the driver's seat, not Bill Gates
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.120]  and Opal Winfrey and the governor saying,
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.120]  yeah, we're going to take the land.
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.120]  He screwed up two days into it saying that, didn't he?
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.120]  Yeah, that was bizarre.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:04.120]  Like, don't worry, I'll take your land
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.120]  so those big bad guys don't take your land.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.120]  Unbelievable, but see, Alex,
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.120]  and this is where I think, in Hawaii,
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.120]  you cannot build where Hawaiians were buried.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.120]  Very sacred land.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.120]  This is sacred land.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.120]  This cannot go to people who aren't Hawaiian.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.120]  This cannot go to people who are not Kamaainas.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.120]  And this most definitely can't go to the state
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.120]  because the state does not represent
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.120]  the interests of the Hawaiians in the Kamaaina.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:32.120]  This has become obvious.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.120]  This needs to belong to the families who lost everything.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.120]  No, I agree.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.120]  And then that starts with the prosecution
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.120]  of the mayor and the water manager and a Black Rock.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.120]  We need to go on the,
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.120]  the people need to be calling for the prosecution
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.120]  of the people that did not repair the power lines
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.120]  or cut the trees,
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.120]  but they still took the tax money in the last five years.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.120]  They are murderers.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:00.120]  They administratively killed those people.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.120]  Yeah, and I was told
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.120]  that the Maui Emergency Management Director,
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.120]  who resigned for health reasons,
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.120]  could you imagine no sense of duty,
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.120]  no sense of civic responsibility, no transparency?
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.120]  Mistakes were made.
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.120]  Same mistakes were made.
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.120]  This was an unbelievable catastrophe.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:15.120]  It happened so fast.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.120]  We're going to get to the bottom of it.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:20.120]  We're ashamed at what happened.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:21.120]  I will tell you this,
[01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:22.120]  and Alex, I want to make sure I say this
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.120]  because I talked to a lot of folks.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.120]  I talked to one gentleman who said
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.120]  shoulder to shoulder with firefighters.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]  And he said,
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]  and he was kind of hurt
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]  by a lot of the conspiracy theories.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.120]  He said, listen, I was there
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.120]  and I was with the firefighters as they were fighting
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.120]  and we watched the fire be like hundreds of yards away
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.120]  and we were surrounded by it in seconds.
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.120]  So there is no doubt that people fought hard.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.120]  Oh, they were compartmentalized.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.120]  The stage was set.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.120]  The atmosphere was prepared for this.
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.120]  Hopeforawaii.com.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:54.120]  Thank you so much, Jason Jones.
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120]  We'll talk to a reporter on the ground
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:56.120]  when we come back.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.120]  Thank you, Jason.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.120]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.120]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:08.120]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.120]  of this essential trace element,
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.120]  which has caused an iodine deficiency
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.120]  in about half the population.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:17.120]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.120]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.120]  There are plenty of proven technologies
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.120]  in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.120]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.120]  And we need to ensure
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.120]  that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:36.120]  derived from ancient sea salts
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.120]  found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.120]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120]  is hands down the best.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.120]  Pure nascent iodine,
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:51.120]  stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.120]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,

[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.120]  The globalists aren't just targeting us
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.120]  through the poison shots
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:04.120]  or the electromagnetic 5G or the GMO crops.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.120]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:11.120]  that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.120]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.120]  The allowable level the government admits
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.120]  that they allow to be in your water supply
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:20.120]  is enough to sterilize you
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:24.120]  and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:25.120]  Look it up.
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:27.120]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.120]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.

[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.120]  It does 10,000 gallons before you replace them.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.120]  It is amazing.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.120]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:45.120]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, well water.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.120]  Almost everything is contaminated.

[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.120]  and counter the globalist onslaught.

[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.120]  You need this filter.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:04.120]  Omega 3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.120]  and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:09.120]  They can be found in grass fed beef,
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.120]  which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.120]  And they can be found in fish,
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.120]  which are arguably the best source of Omega 3s.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.120]  But the problem today is finding fish
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.120]  without a high mercury content.
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:27.120]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil

[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.120]  our brain, and our heart.

[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.400]  We don't get any money from that.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.400]  We're just trying to help people.

[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:10.400]  After 10 minutes of failure of video, we go to phone.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.400]  That's what we do.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:16.400]  A lot of the shows will just idle and just for hours try the same failed thing over and over again.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.400]  We're not going to do that.
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:19.400]  We're not going to do that.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:20.400]  Follow the news cover.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.400]  Please support the guest.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.400]  Here's real American news.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:33.400]  Nick short or on Steve Bannon's war room being interrupted and cut off by Leptis trying to report on what's happening.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:37.400]  People's minds here.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.400]  Hey, what's up, Nick?
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.400]  I've been trying to reach you.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.400]  We're reaching out to you on X.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.400]  You're supposed to be meeting with people here.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.400]  What victims?
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.400]  Okay.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.400]  Yeah.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.400]  So this is.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.400]  This is.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:52.400]  So you're seeing this live right now.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.400]  People actually track.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:54.400]  They tracked me down.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.400]  And you're saying an attempt.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:00.400]  You said you're saying an attempt.
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.400]  Resources.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.400]  I'm not taking up any resources here.
[01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:13.889]  So, that's where we are right now. They don't want us to know what's happening there. And
[01:37:13.889 --> 01:37:18.630]  you say, well, that's Hawaii, I've never been there, why do I care? It's the same administrative
[01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:24.090]  attack everywhere, turning off our pipelines, our infrastructure, our energy. They know
[01:37:24.090 --> 01:37:31.990]  exactly what they are doing. Why do you care so much about people in Hawaii? Because
[01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:42.910]  they're coming for all of us. It's the same globalist program everywhere, over and over
[01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:51.830]  and over again. Now, I'm going to play clip one intros, Big Breen's new promo, and it's
[01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:54.470]  no big deal. We don't have our guests. We will not have the guests on today. We'll
[01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:58.470]  have them on tomorrow. But I'm not going to do the, like when people call them talk
[01:37:58.470 --> 01:38:01.110]  shows, it's that joke with prank callers, where they call in, I'm not saying it's a prank
[01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:05.190]  caller, and they just, hello, hello, hello, you need to do this dance. We get guests
[01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:12.110]  on early before to make sure they're tested to do it. That's how we do it. Here's
[01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:22.470]  the clip. Can't play it either. All right. I'm leaving then. Wow. I am so sick of
[01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:29.470]  all this. I told you guys, it's clip one intros, AJ, the dude, McBreen clip. All right, I'm out of here.
[01:38:52.470 --> 01:39:01.710]  Fulton County, clerk of court, she Alexander says, even though she's human, she strives
[01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:08.150]  for perfection. That's how the mishap happened. The mishap was she inadvertently posted
[01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:13.070]  the indictment charges against former president Donald Trump, even though the grand jury was
[01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:17.630]  still deliberating Monday. But I'm not like the mainstream media. It just tells you that
[01:39:17.630 --> 01:39:22.990]  Fulton County, Georgia put out a report. Here it is, office of the Fulton County clerk
[01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:29.230]  of superior and magistrate courts, honorable Shay Alexander and Trump in the indictment
[01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:33.750]  I showed you yesterday in Georgia is being indicted. They say it's a fraud, that no
[01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:37.830]  one shut it down. No one kicked people out, but they did. And they kept counting.
[01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:41.309]  And that's on the surveillance footage. How many ballots went through those machines and
[01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:44.990]  those two hours when there was no one there to supervise, to be present consistent
[01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:49.269]  with your statutes and rules to supervise the tabulation.
[01:39:49.269 --> 01:39:54.269]  They're trying to make it illegal to challenge them. Of course, the pipe never broke. They
[01:39:54.269 --> 01:39:59.790]  lied. There is now a hitch in the tabulation of us. Water pipe has broken inside the
[01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:05.110]  arena. They had counted 86,000 absentee ballots. We don't know how many more they had yet
[01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:08.790]  to tabulate, but all the tabulation of those ballots has now stopped.
[01:40:08.790 --> 01:40:13.990]  The pipe broke at 607. It was repaired at 807.
[01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:16.910]  Which day, AM or PM?
[01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:17.910]  That was AM.
[01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:19.309]  Of which day?
[01:40:19.309 --> 01:40:20.309]  On election day.
[01:40:20.309 --> 01:40:25.830]  Here's what the audit found, quote, seven falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated
[01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:31.590]  vote totals. For example, a batch containing 59 actual ballot images for Joe Biden in
[01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:37.910]  42 for Donald Trump was reported as a hundred for Biden and zero for Trump. The seven
[01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:44.190]  batches of ballot images with 554 votes for Joe Biden, 140 votes for Donald Trump and
[01:40:44.190 --> 01:40:50.389]  11 votes for Joe Jorgensen had tally sheets in the audit falsified to show 850 votes
[01:40:50.389 --> 01:40:54.870]  for Biden, zero votes for Trump and zero votes for Jorgensen.
[01:40:54.870 --> 01:41:00.550]  Wait, did you just follow that? How is that not flat out criminal fraud? We'd love
[01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:04.550]  to know because it certainly sounds like flat out criminal fraud.
[01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:10.070]  It's like the same group just got caught publishing the indictment index. Then they
[01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:13.430]  said it wasn't true. Then they said it was a hack. Then they said it was fake. Now
[01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:16.190]  they said it's real and nothing to worry about.
[01:41:16.190 --> 01:41:21.150]  It wasn't an official document. It wasn't official charges. It was the driver and
[01:41:21.150 --> 01:41:22.650]  it was a work sample.
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:27.590]  Even though it had a case number, Alexander says it didn't have a stamp and other markings
[01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:29.830]  that would have made it official.
[01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:35.070]  That fictitious document matched exactly the charges that we now see in this indictment.
[01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:40.110]  Can you tell us more about that document leak? Because now you have the former president's
[01:41:40.110 --> 01:41:44.230]  lawyers who are serious problem with your office.
[01:41:44.230 --> 01:41:48.950]  No, I can't tell you anything about what you refer to. What I can tell you is that
[01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:53.830]  we had a grand jury here in Fulton County. They deliberated till almost eight o'clock,
[01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:58.190]  if not right after eight o'clock and indictment was returned. It was true build and you
[01:41:58.190 --> 01:42:05.550]  now have an indictment. I am not an expert on clerks duties or even administrative duties.
[01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:09.630]  I wouldn't know how to work that system. And so I'm not going to speculate. Next question.
[01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:14.750]  Well, Adrian, I don't think we've ever seen such an affront to our justice system
[01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:18.389]  and the role of law than what we witnessed in Fulton County yesterday. They're going
[01:42:18.389 --> 01:42:23.150]  to ram this through because they want to interfere in the 2024 election. So what did
[01:42:23.150 --> 01:42:28.070]  they do? They released this indictment in the middle of the night in Fulton County,
[01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:34.269]  just like they count votes without observers present. And they release these counts and
[01:42:34.269 --> 01:42:41.349]  charge President Trump for literally sending tweets, encouraging people to watch the news,
[01:42:41.349 --> 01:42:49.470]  to engage in public hearings, to hold press conferences. And they're trying to criminalize
[01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:55.510]  not just his First Amendment rights, but his right to participate in the democratic
[01:42:55.510 --> 01:43:00.110]  process. And while they're doing that, they're trying to take away the American people's
[01:43:00.110 --> 01:43:04.990]  choice of participating in the democratic process in the 2024 election. You'll maintain
[01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:09.510]  custody of it from here? Yes, sir. Senator Josh Hawley said it best. They're sending
[01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:14.309]  a message to everybody. This is a dictatorship. So I think the message is real clear. Don't
[01:43:14.309 --> 01:43:18.269]  challenge us. Don't go to work for anybody who will challenge us. Don't vote for Donald
[01:43:18.269 --> 01:43:23.309]  Trump or anybody like him, or we'll treat you as a domestic terrorist. And I tell you
[01:43:23.309 --> 01:43:28.309]  what, Laura, this is a recipe for one party rule in this country. And if that's the case,
[01:43:28.309 --> 01:43:32.050]  this isn't the United States of America anymore. Our constitutional democracy doesn't
[01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:37.010]  exist anymore. Where have you heard this before? That they're setting up a dictatorship.
[01:43:37.010 --> 01:44:00.530]  They're coming after all of us. Well, way out west, southwest, down in Texas, there's
[01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:06.930]  this fella fella I want to tell you about fella by the name of Alex Jones, at least
[01:44:06.930 --> 01:44:12.010]  that was the handle is freedom loving parents gave him. And he made pretty good use of
[01:44:12.010 --> 01:44:19.330]  it himself. This Alex Jones, he's a straight shooter. He calls himself an info warrior,
[01:44:19.330 --> 01:44:25.050]  a globalist killer. He's a truth bomber, dropping nukes of knowledge across radio
[01:44:25.050 --> 01:44:31.090]  waves, television sets, and all over the world wide web. Many have tried to stop
[01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:37.210]  them, shut them up, or silence them, but it never quite worked out. Not for a man like him.
[01:44:37.210 --> 01:44:43.690]  He's a real Paul Revere of the 21st century, a truth teller. Hell, even more honest than old,
[01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:49.610]  honest Abe Lincoln. That's Alex Jones. There's a lot about the man that didn't make a whole
[01:44:49.610 --> 01:44:55.889]  lot of sense to me. Not until I tuned into info wars, that is. Then things started to
[01:44:55.889 --> 01:45:04.090]  become clear. The tyranny encircling the globe, and every freedom loving patriot on it. Inch by
[01:45:04.090 --> 01:45:10.690]  inch, mile by mile, power hungry politicians and money hungry whores were swallowing the whole
[01:45:10.690 --> 01:45:17.650]  damn thing whole. A real prison planet. Not even God was allowed to remain untouched by
[01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:24.849]  these Satan's servant degenerates. Not God or his son. Until Alex Jones had something to say
[01:45:24.889 --> 01:45:31.650]  about it, that is. Now this story that's about to unfold, it started back in the late 90s,
[01:45:31.650 --> 01:45:37.809]  just about the time the Twin Towers collapsed. Like two tall stacks of pancakes with hot
[01:45:37.809 --> 01:45:44.130]  boiling syrup pouring on down, bubbling up from the inside out. I only mention it
[01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:52.050]  because sometimes there's a man. I won't say hero because what's a hero? But sometimes there's
[01:45:52.050 --> 01:45:58.050]  a man and I'm talking about Alex Jones here. Sometimes there's a man. Well, he's the man for
[01:45:58.050 --> 01:46:06.530]  his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's Alex Jones. Live from the Central
[01:46:06.530 --> 01:46:16.370]  Texas Command Center, deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones. All right, folks,
[01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:19.490]  I don't put on an act here that I'm very upset about war with Russia.
[01:46:20.130 --> 01:46:25.170]  I'm very upset about all the new poison shots that are rolling out. I'm very upset about new
[01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:29.650]  plans for lockdowns. I'm very upset that I'm not trimming the trees and Black Rock ordering no
[01:46:29.650 --> 01:46:34.290]  upkeep for five years on those power lines and then turn the water off and killing all
[01:46:34.290 --> 01:46:40.290]  those people. They'll do it to all of us. And this is their model. And these people are
[01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:47.330]  sick and they're evil. Nick Sordore is our guest. He's a talk show host and does a great
[01:46:47.410 --> 01:46:51.730]  job as an independent journalist taking deep dives into stories via on-scene reporting.
[01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:59.410]  You can find him at Nick Sordore. That's N-I-C-K-S-O-R-T-O-R. He's in
[01:46:59.410 --> 01:47:05.170]  Maui and he's been harassed, not by local Hawaiians, but by leftist operatives there
[01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:11.170]  trying to stop any reporting. He got caught live Friday on The War Room with Steve Bannon.
[01:47:11.170 --> 01:47:15.250]  I joined Steve Bannon at 5 p.m. Eastern tomorrow for his show. So, Nick, thanks for going
[01:47:15.250 --> 01:47:19.170]  through hell. I know you're exhausted and been there. We only got like 10 minutes left in live
[01:47:19.170 --> 01:47:22.690]  broadcast. I'm gonna give you the floor to tell folks what you witnessed. We appreciate you.
[01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:30.450]  Alex, I have covered a lot of disasters. I'm one of the independent journalists that blew
[01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:34.290]  the lid off of the East Palestine story because obviously the mainstream media doesn't like to
[01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:41.889]  cover any of this stuff. And so I ended up here on the ground and this is by far the most
[01:47:41.889 --> 01:47:49.410]  catastrophic failure of government in every single form that you can think of that I have
[01:47:49.410 --> 01:47:54.930]  ever seen and I'm sure that most people have ever seen. I mean, what we're talking about,
[01:47:54.930 --> 01:48:00.050]  these people, they're constantly being lied to by their government, especially their mayor
[01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:05.889]  and their governor. And it seems like at this point they're trying to intimidate journalists to
[01:48:05.889 --> 01:48:11.330]  not answer questions or not ask them questions. They will not answer them. I've been asking them
[01:48:11.889 --> 01:48:18.690]  ferociously about the missing children. They don't want to talk about the missing children
[01:48:18.690 --> 01:48:26.690]  because they messed up. At a minimum, they messed up. All of these children were home from school.
[01:48:26.690 --> 01:48:33.010]  These parents were forced to go to work that day and they were trying to rush home to save their
[01:48:33.010 --> 01:48:37.650]  children and they weren't able to do it. And now the government is hiding how many children are
[01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:42.850]  dead specifically to save their own butts. This has nothing to do with helping the community.
[01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:48.290]  It has to do with making sure that they can stay elected and get elected to higher office.
[01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:53.250]  That's what I'm seeing at this point. Tell us what you've witnessed when you got there
[01:48:53.250 --> 01:48:58.450]  and then who these anti-vetite people are. They're finding you in the woods reporting.
[01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:01.090]  You were telling Steve Bannon you're being tracked by these people.
[01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:06.850]  Yeah, so Alex, I actually, and I'm sorry it's very windy here today.
[01:49:06.850 --> 01:49:08.850]  No, we hear you loud and clear, brother.
[01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:15.250]  Perfect. It was 5 45 in the morning and I was standing by my hotel at the time. I have since
[01:49:15.250 --> 01:49:19.570]  had to move hotels. I had to change out my car because I was terrified that these people
[01:49:19.570 --> 01:49:25.889]  were going to know. This guy followed me at 5 45 in the morning. He was waiting on me
[01:49:25.889 --> 01:49:33.650]  to come in and and try to intimidate me. Now, keep in mind, this was less than 12 hours
[01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:39.250]  from when I had confronted the governor about the missing children. It was very vocal. That video
[01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:44.530]  ended up, you know, you had a lot of local news crews there. And so all of these these
[01:49:44.530 --> 01:49:49.250]  news stations around Hawaii reported on that confrontation that I had with the mayor.
[01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:53.730]  And then all of a sudden, this guy shows up here at 5 45 in the morning behind me
[01:49:53.730 --> 01:49:57.889]  while I'm doing a live shot. I was only two minutes into that live shot. I'm 45 minutes
[01:49:57.889 --> 01:50:04.930]  from Lahaina. So it was really terrifying to me. I didn't even know how to react because,
[01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:10.930]  you know, who are these people? Why is this happening? Why am I getting death threats
[01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:15.090]  just for reporting the news? Why are they put a 12 mile seclusion zone? Why are they blocking
[01:50:15.090 --> 01:50:18.690]  aid? Why did they cut off the water and refuse it? Why did they not cut the trees?
[01:50:18.690 --> 01:50:21.969]  Why did they leave the power on? Why did they turn the sirens off? Why are they not
[01:50:21.969 --> 01:50:24.130]  saying how many dead kids there are? This is bad.
[01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:29.570]  They're arresting residents that are trying to go into their houses that are in the exclusion
[01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:36.370]  zone. There's one right now that is waiting to be to get out of jail. And he is,
[01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:42.450]  he's suffering there. And he's a resident what his house was destroyed. And he's not allowed
[01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:46.450]  into the exclusion zone. Maui police decided they were going to put him in jail. And he's
[01:50:46.450 --> 01:50:52.610]  been there. The land's worth 5.4 billion. When they build on, they say 20 million. This is,
[01:50:52.610 --> 01:50:57.650]  this is the mafia. They had the ability to stop this fire. Alex, there were
[01:50:59.090 --> 01:51:03.330]  the firefighters and the government. It was their commanders. It wasn't the firefighters,
[01:51:03.330 --> 01:51:10.530]  actually. It was the commanders that decided to deem this fire contained 100% contained is what
[01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:15.650]  they said. And then, so they sent all the firefighters out of town to another part of
[01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:20.290]  Hawaii that had, you know, very minor fires in the middle of big open fields.
[01:51:20.290 --> 01:51:27.170]  They sent them there. Meanwhile, this fire ended up exploding across the town of Bahaina. And the,
[01:51:27.170 --> 01:51:33.889]  the residents don't know why they're like, we, this happens every single year. This time,
[01:51:33.889 --> 01:51:38.530]  actually, there have been four wildfires out here. They should be prepared for this stuff,
[01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:42.610]  theoretically, but all of a sudden they're not prepared for it. This blindsided them.
[01:51:42.610 --> 01:51:48.050]  How did this happen? Incredible. Well, we only got six minutes left. I want to invite you on
[01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:51.250]  the show tomorrow for the weekday show, but you've been there. What are the locals saying?
[01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:58.610]  What's your best breakdown of what's going on? All right. So the best breakdown is that there's
[01:51:58.610 --> 01:52:02.690]  hardly a breakdown because people don't know what's going on. They're not, they're being lied
[01:52:02.690 --> 01:52:07.969]  to by their government. They were told by the governor on Monday that all of the sirens were
[01:52:07.969 --> 01:52:11.969]  broken. Therefore they couldn't turn the sirens on. And then he came out Tuesday and was like,
[01:52:11.969 --> 01:52:17.250]  well, only some of the sirens are broken. And, and then the next day it comes out that
[01:52:17.250 --> 01:52:23.410]  nobody actually tried to activate the sirens. So they're lying. People can't get any answers
[01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:30.370]  here. They want to know how the children are because that is children are the, you know,
[01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:34.530]  the most important thing in people's lives. I can't even imagine having a missing child,
[01:52:34.530 --> 01:52:38.290]  but these people are so terrified. They're just looking for answers. They want to find their
[01:52:38.290 --> 01:52:42.850]  children and they can't do it. They're not getting any answers from their government because
[01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:45.969]  their elected officials are just covering their own butts.
[01:52:47.490 --> 01:52:50.450]  Well, I'm sure you've seen the clip when obviously you interviewed the governor,
[01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:53.969]  but the governor's like, I want to take this land. They've got the mayor saying,
[01:52:53.969 --> 01:52:58.210]  I don't know about dead kids. I mean, the arrogance level is bizarre. Biden won't even say
[01:52:58.210 --> 01:53:02.769]  he's sorry. Won't even talk about it. This is weird. Yeah. So Alex, I'll say one
[01:53:02.769 --> 01:53:06.930]  more thing before you cut away the Biden administration that we found out, you know,
[01:53:06.930 --> 01:53:11.330]  they said they were going to give $700 checks and you know, we know they gave that's, that's
[01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:15.570]  under $2 million. All right. And originally they were going to give it to people that were
[01:53:15.570 --> 01:53:19.010]  economically displaced here as well. Well, they all of a sudden backtracking decided
[01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:26.769]  they're not going to do that. And so some people get $700, but $700 here does almost
[01:53:26.769 --> 01:53:30.850]  nothing for these people. Okay. They can't afford their own accommodations. They're
[01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:35.490]  having to stay with in some of these rooms that they're being put in, they're staying with
[01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:40.130]  three and four other people and they have families that they're, they're putting in these
[01:53:40.130 --> 01:53:45.250]  rooms with three and four other strangers. I mean, it is like, this is a, the relief effort
[01:53:45.250 --> 01:53:51.170]  here by government is absolutely abysmal. It is catastrophic, Alex. Well, we got about
[01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:55.090]  three minutes left. What are you seeing? The locals are saying they're not seeing hardly any
[01:53:55.090 --> 01:53:59.170]  relievers with nobody there except police blocking people getting in. The locals are
[01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:03.809]  having to bring supplies in by ship or by boat or by jet ski. What are you seeing?
[01:54:03.809 --> 01:54:10.610]  So this is actually one of the most infuriating parts about this story is they weren't allowing
[01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:15.490]  release supplies in in the beginning. Okay. You had a lot of locals, a lot of islanders that
[01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:22.290]  were stepping up from other parts of Maui trying to bring supply into the residence. Okay. But
[01:54:22.290 --> 01:54:26.610]  they had this massive exclusion zone. Even the main road was shut down. You couldn't get in
[01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:31.650]  or out. All right. And they were turning away. They were barring FEMA in particular was
[01:54:31.650 --> 01:54:35.650]  barring release supplies to come in. They couldn't bring water. Using the dead bodies,
[01:54:35.650 --> 01:54:42.769]  the people they killed is the reason. I've been hiding something that, I mean, I have never seen,
[01:54:42.769 --> 01:54:46.370]  you know, people were telling me that you can get, you could get closer to the world trade
[01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:53.170]  center after nine 11 than you can getting in here. They built a wall around this entire town
[01:54:53.170 --> 01:54:57.809]  and you know, if they were to do the same thing on the border, I mean, it would be the most
[01:54:57.809 --> 01:55:02.130]  secure place you've ever seen, but they're not doing that. So people actually came out,
[01:55:02.130 --> 01:55:07.809]  residents decided to take their boats and their jet skis in a legally cross into the zone in order
[01:55:07.809 --> 01:55:13.330]  to bring these release supplies. And the fact that they even had to do that is just, I mean,
[01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:17.730]  that, that is a tragedy in and of itself. I don't know what's going on in there. Nobody
[01:55:17.730 --> 01:55:22.850]  knows because we can't see next door tour. We got two minutes left. If you join us tomorrow
[01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:26.769]  under the weekday show, I'd appreciate that. But what else is on your mind? What else do
[01:55:26.769 --> 01:55:28.210]  people not know about that they should know?
[01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:35.969]  So the problem is we don't know what we don't know. And it's, it's gotten to the point
[01:55:35.969 --> 01:55:40.769]  where I've spoken to so many different locals. I've spent so much time here on the ground
[01:55:40.769 --> 01:55:46.210]  all day, every day, trying to talk to residents. They don't know. They don't even know
[01:55:46.210 --> 01:55:50.610]  what questions to ask at this point, because you know, for the, for the, the, the simple
[01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:55.330]  questions that they have, they still can't get the answers for those. And so I am ferociously
[01:55:55.330 --> 01:56:00.290]  trying to go after the elected officials here. And I'm about to post a video on that where
[01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:05.650]  I made a bunch of news here because I chased the mayor down because he didn't want to
[01:56:05.650 --> 01:56:08.610]  take my questions. He was trying to run away from my questions.
[01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:12.610]  Who is this Antifa looking guy that showed up the middle of nowhere, following your
[01:56:12.610 --> 01:56:17.969]  own? I don't, I don't actually know. I don't know. I don't know where he came
[01:56:17.969 --> 01:56:23.490]  from. He just all of a sudden showed up behind me. I've never seen it. I was almost
[01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:27.650]  speechless. Bannon was speechless. We didn't know what to say because again,
[01:56:27.650 --> 01:56:34.930]  this is five 45 in the morning behind my hotel. I mean, it's, well, he's a white guy. Okay.
[01:56:34.930 --> 01:56:39.490]  He's clearly not a native Hawaiian. The tan that I've gotten since I've been here is much
[01:56:39.490 --> 01:56:44.610]  darker than his is. Where did he come from? He doesn't clearly a coverup is going on.
[01:56:44.610 --> 01:56:52.290]  Operatives are on the ground. This is huge at Twitter, Nick short or S O R T O R.
[01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:57.330]  Nick, join us again tomorrow. You can God speed and be safe. This is a bank house for
[01:56:57.330 --> 01:57:03.090]  administrative mass murder in my view. Appreciate it, sir. Let's talk to Mark. Appreciate you.
[01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:06.850]  All right. I'll be back tomorrow. Lord willing. We'll see who knows. We'll be on air

[01:57:14.370 --> 01:57:18.769]  Uh, it's obviously the big story is the COVID lockdowns are playing again with mask.
[01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:25.410]  And then so much more. They got the new shot. They just announced. It's just totally insane.
[01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:29.090]  I appreciate the crew. Appreciate you all. This place is shot up to hell. I don't know.
[01:57:29.090 --> 01:57:33.809]  I'll be on air tomorrow. We're going to try though. 11 AM central. Um, and we'll,

[01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:42.610]  this. All right. Oh, sure. It takes over.

[01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:55.250]  because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[01:57:55.250 --> 01:57:59.490]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:02.690]  But when the folks had been a man came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees,

[01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:31.570]  really strong, but these are all close. Second and thirds medium roast wake up America.
[01:58:32.690 --> 01:58:36.210]  That's what my go-to dark roast tip of the spear tastes the best
[01:58:36.210 --> 01:58:39.809]  and is amazing. And it's still very, very strong. Gives you that path.
[01:58:39.809 --> 01:58:43.809]  They're all three available at info war store.com and the thunder operation.
