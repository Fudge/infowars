[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.520 --> 00:34.080]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well Mike Adams
[00:34.080 --> 00:41.560]  wrote this for natural news dot com over a week ago we posted it info wars dot com and
[00:41.560 --> 00:46.960]  we got attacked by the London Telegraph you name it for simply pointing out that it could
[00:46.960 --> 00:53.680]  be a black hole that swallowed up the missing Malaysian aircraft and of course Mike was
[00:53.680 --> 00:59.800]  saying that he didn't believe that he was just looking at every option though however
[00:59.800 --> 01:06.840]  impossible it could be kind of a Bermuda triangle thing was it swallowed into deep space or
[01:06.840 --> 01:11.560]  has it been hijacked by some paramilitary group be used as a giant flying cruise missile
[01:11.560 --> 01:19.080]  of the nuclear weapon in it I mean we just looked at every possible angle and now well
[01:19.080 --> 01:26.960]  now seeing in is saying that is it preposterous to think that a black hole caused flight 370
[01:26.960 --> 01:35.560]  to go missing how many weeks are we into this thing it is a giant diversion and I believe
[01:35.560 --> 01:39.480]  that and the evidence is actually coming out that governments know where it went and this
[01:39.480 --> 01:46.000]  is some type of authorized drill or set up where people thought they were part of a drill
[01:46.000 --> 01:55.000]  that there was a stage hijacking and Lord even knows what is going on with this but
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.200]  it really doesn't matter I mean I'm sad people that are we're on the plane we don't know
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.640]  where they are but some people email me and I see comments say Alex cover the Malaysian
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.440]  flight more you you've got 20 channels of fake news covering it on television you've
[02:08.440 --> 02:15.040]  got all the newspapers covering it daily and we just have so much serious stuff to cover
[02:15.040 --> 02:21.240]  that even though it's very interesting mystery I'm not allotting much time to it now what
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.960]  do we have that's really important coming up I think on the nightly news tonight we'll
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.720]  do an hour instead of 30 minutes for president planet dot TV viewers because I want to re-air
[02:31.720 --> 02:38.400]  the entire 30 minute speech that Senator Rand Paul gave at Berkeley and got a standing ovation
[02:38.400 --> 02:45.120]  from the people there showing how a true libertarian constitutional candidate as he's going to
[02:45.120 --> 02:51.360]  be for president obviously could unify true liberals with true conservatives and constitutionalist
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.080]  to try to save this country and that's why the system has been trying to destroy Rand
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.640]  Paul he's moderated a little bit with the establishment so that they wouldn't destroy
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.400]  him out of hand but he really is a statesman and a born leader the more I watch what he
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.800]  does and we're just very blessed to have him and he he really has an incredible learning
[03:09.800 --> 03:15.960]  curve with what he's doing and I know he listens to the show and I know that there I've told
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.640]  Ron Paul this on air and off air and I know that they're listening and of course they
[03:20.640 --> 03:24.440]  don't need to hear from me they're smart guys but they need to radicalize their message
[03:24.440 --> 03:30.720]  because the globalists are so radical they need to meet the globalist threat with a response
[03:30.720 --> 03:37.240]  that's actually to the point of the enemy we need to address the fact that a criminal
[03:37.240 --> 03:43.040]  shadow government is taking over and it's intimidating and blackmailing Congress and
[03:43.040 --> 03:48.520]  the Supreme Court and that it's illegitimate this is how every other country ends up getting
[03:48.520 --> 03:52.280]  taken over look at third world countries where the military industrial complex ends up taking
[03:52.280 --> 03:57.240]  over with the special interest that control it that's what's going on here and so we
[03:57.240 --> 04:05.400]  come back from break I'm going to air here on the transmission I don't know 10 minutes
[04:05.400 --> 04:10.480]  of the historic speech the first 10 minutes is the most powerful and then we're going
[04:10.480 --> 04:17.680]  to be breaking that down because that's the top story that's what's really important because
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.000]  if people start going oh there really are FEMA camps they really are buying billions
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.360]  of rounds of ammo they really are spying on us illegally they really are incarcerating
[04:26.360 --> 04:30.800]  people for no reason they really are setting up this anti-liberty grid and trying to suppress
[04:30.800 --> 04:35.280]  the press we can have an open debate about how authoritarian we're becoming and the fact
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.520]  that the globalists are involved in a revolution to try to convert us into pure tyranny but
[04:40.520 --> 04:46.320]  it could backfire on them if we politically and economically and culturally resist and
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.240]  speak out against it we can use their offensive as a way to rally humanity and it will blow
[04:51.240 --> 04:56.920]  up in their face I'm going to explain this when we come back but this is the heart of
[04:56.920 --> 05:03.160]  victory the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda they
[05:03.160 --> 05:09.040]  are manipulating our genetics we are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers
[05:09.040 --> 05:14.080]  that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs
[05:14.080 --> 05:18.160]  the key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it after consulting

[07:16.400 --> 07:22.200]  government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good

[08:34.120 --> 08:42.440]  not going to take being enslaved we're not going to be usurped and the first thing we
[08:42.440 --> 08:50.560]  need to do to reverse the criminal authoritarian tide globally is to recognize liberty versus
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.680]  tyranny authoritarianism versus libertarianism is to recognize renaissance versus dark age
[08:57.680 --> 09:04.880]  gang run government versus the independent animating contest of liberty free association
[09:04.880 --> 09:12.440]  free will not being put in a box not being labeled being complex people through diversity
[09:12.440 --> 09:18.880]  not the fake kleptocratic diversity that actually robs individualism that is political correctness
[09:18.880 --> 09:26.000]  this is so essential that we identify the globalist as the criminals that we identify
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.440]  their form of government as a central banking derivatives fractional reserve fraud where
[09:32.440 --> 09:37.600]  a handful of elite families and corporations are able to issue the currency and credit
[09:37.600 --> 09:44.080]  and dominate the globe who then predatorily target their political and economic cultural
[09:44.080 --> 09:54.400]  competition with systems of deindustrialization dumbing down we have a giant criminal shadow
[09:54.400 --> 10:03.000]  government there is unified policy uniformity of agenda worldwide under the global corporate
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.880]  model whether it's australia germany or the us the uk or mexico the same corporate governance
[10:09.880 --> 10:16.000]  systems that are authoritarian global corporate governance is being put in with ubiquitous
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.280]  spying ubiquitous surveillance ubiquitous police state ubiquitous attacks on any form
[10:22.280 --> 10:27.560]  of individualism and true diversity and if we're ever going to have a chance to beat
[10:27.560 --> 10:34.680]  this we have to fully recognize that we've been incrementally brought into this ran
[10:34.680 --> 10:40.480]  paul has done that ted cruise is beginning to do that we're going into a dictatorship
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.600]  the government's scary congress is being blackmailed and threatened people are scared
[10:46.600 --> 10:53.760]  in congress we're being spied on that's what's going on with m i six and m i five against
[10:53.760 --> 10:57.760]  the british parliament that's what's going on in germany that's what's happening with
[10:57.760 --> 11:03.120]  the u bureaucracy that's what's happening here they're using this to stop whistleblowers
[11:03.120 --> 11:09.760]  they're using this to intimidate people and ran paul knows a lot more than he says in
[11:09.760 --> 11:16.400]  this speech he says it seems like they're scared i don't have any proof of that because
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.480]  he knows he can't come out and say they're scared because he's saying it in confidence
[11:21.480 --> 11:25.920]  that of course they're being spied on it's come out of course they're being blackmailed
[11:25.920 --> 11:28.960]  of course they're being threatened do you have any idea of the level of dirty tricks
[11:28.960 --> 11:35.280]  i go through the level of co entel pro and cognitive infiltration cast sunstein garbage
[11:35.280 --> 11:41.280]  that's great i steer into that because that's how i know i'm over the target like a bomber
[11:41.280 --> 11:48.960]  pilot but this new world order folks is not all powerful and can be defeated that's why
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.520]  they want to tell you all day there's no billions of bullets being bought there's no fema camps
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.280]  there's no nsa spying there's no shadow government none of this is happening the federal reserves
[11:58.280 --> 12:05.200]  why federal it's not private when it is of course private because if the truth ever comes
[12:05.200 --> 12:11.480]  out and we have a debate about who really runs the world and how the planet's being
[12:11.480 --> 12:17.760]  stolen by fraudsters it's over for the globalist and if we point out that they're the authors
[12:17.760 --> 12:25.760]  of our discontent and the authors of our societal injustice that they are the prime movers
[12:25.760 --> 12:30.920]  they're not the authors of all of it but they're the authors of much of it and they use the
[12:30.920 --> 12:37.520]  weakness of society control if statesmen like rand paul continue to talk like this and others
[12:37.520 --> 12:44.160]  pick up the drumbeat it's over for the new world order if we address them head on ten
[12:44.160 --> 12:48.000]  years ago sounded radical when i said there was a shadow government setting up a total
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.480]  police state surveilling everyone with plans to put troops on the streets i had all the
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.840]  rand corporation documents i've been to all the urban warfare drills 18 years ago i knew
[12:56.840 --> 13:02.040]  the plan they've written it back i was reading it it wasn't my opinion but people said can't
[13:02.040 --> 13:07.080]  be true i'm not going to look at it had footage of marines training to confiscate firearms
[13:07.080 --> 13:11.960]  all over the country and admitting it was for america i got a couple of responses your
[13:11.960 --> 13:18.720]  anti marine anti military trader no i'm anti the marines being given illegal orders or
[13:18.720 --> 13:26.400]  that's fake video that's not real even though i had news articles about what i just filmed
[13:26.400 --> 13:31.320]  or oh my gosh this is horrible what are we going to do about it but again the mainstream
[13:31.320 --> 13:35.880]  media would never admit it was all real so that we can never have the debate that's why
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.000]  that congressman told jesse ventura in the fema camp special there's no fema camps there
[13:41.000 --> 13:44.200]  there's no emergency centers established or not no there's not he goes there's space
[13:44.200 --> 13:48.480]  aliens going to come down on the sky governor and ventura goes here's the bill you authored
[13:48.480 --> 13:57.440]  it you sponsored it and he went oh i do remember that bill and started laughing and when that
[13:57.440 --> 14:02.600]  all happened they had time warner shut that show down and never air it again and erase
[14:02.600 --> 14:09.680]  it off the tvo and the digital cable and tried to get time warner to cancel the show
[14:09.680 --> 14:13.800]  and instead they said no we'll just turn it into tuba cobers and discredit it and humanzies
[14:13.800 --> 14:20.080]  and stuff so believe me folks they don't want to have a real debate they want to just keep
[14:20.080 --> 14:26.800]  denying it's all going on and oh it's so radical ran paul says there's a shadow government
[14:26.800 --> 14:34.600]  that's arrogant and taking over of course there is and it's public we force the debate
[14:34.600 --> 14:41.160]  we are the media the state run media is discredited the systems hoping to sell tyranny is trendy
[14:41.160 --> 14:47.000]  that's why obama and you know is on ellen and is on sports center and is on all the
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.960]  entertainment shows about how cool he is they want to make it fun being screwed by the new
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.040]  world order so let's go to the first five six minutes in this segment we'll come back
[14:56.040 --> 15:01.440]  in the next segment i want to play the first 10 12 minutes of rand paul's historic speech
[15:01.440 --> 15:06.720]  we had the text yesterday we broke the story before he gave a speech now it's big national
[15:06.720 --> 15:13.800]  news and people are resonating with it across the political spectrum for liberty for freedom
[15:13.800 --> 15:20.160]  regardless of race color creed political persuasion this is statesmanship this is veritas this
[15:20.160 --> 15:26.080]  is the blood of courage the blood of victory and we have to tell it like it is sure it
[15:26.080 --> 15:31.920]  sounds radical to get up here and say this stuff because it is radical if i was a small
[15:31.920 --> 15:38.000]  town police chief that lived down a mountain by a dam and it took me and we got an emergency
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.120]  call by radio that the dam had broken and that millions of gallons of water were coming
[15:45.120 --> 15:49.740]  20 feet deep we're going to wipe out the town in 10 minutes i would run around on the loud
[15:49.740 --> 15:55.920]  speakers yelling get out of your houses go to high ground now now now go go go go and
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.360]  it wouldn't be fire in a theater because there is fire in a theater there is water coming
[16:01.360 --> 16:07.800]  down the mountain you understand that oh hey man that's a little radical don't be running
[16:07.800 --> 16:10.760]  around like a chicken with your head cut off don't yell fire in a theater well if you're
[16:10.760 --> 16:15.040]  in a theater and there's a fire folks in the old days it was cellulose and they would explode
[16:15.040 --> 16:20.720]  in flame it was explosive what the film was made out of they were built in like oven boxes
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.200]  in case there was a fire so it wouldn't burn everybody up in there and if you yell fire
[16:25.200 --> 16:28.520]  in a theater there was so many theater fires people would run screaming and trample each
[16:28.520 --> 16:36.400]  other but if there is a fire in the theater you better yell there's fire in a theater
[16:36.400 --> 16:39.920]  they want to just tell you it's indoor heating and you know never mind that orange flame
[16:39.920 --> 16:43.800]  it's going to you know make you live forever no it's not it's going to burn our society
[16:43.800 --> 16:47.120]  down let's start going to the intro of his speech we're going to air quite a bit of
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.680]  this and then get into all the other news here it is great to be here at Berkeley thank
[16:52.680 --> 16:59.640]  you thank you to the Berkeley forum for inviting me now you may be a republican or a democrat
[16:59.640 --> 17:05.280]  or a libertarian I'm not here to tell you what to be I am here to tell you though that
[17:05.280 --> 17:11.400]  your rights especially your right to privacy is under assault I'm here to tell you that
[17:11.400 --> 17:18.640]  if you own a cell phone you're under surveillance I'm here to tell you that the NSA believes
[17:18.640 --> 17:25.600]  that equal protection means that Americans should be spied upon equally including congress
[17:25.600 --> 17:32.240]  instead of equal protection to them it's equal disdain they don't care if you're white or
[17:32.240 --> 17:39.840]  black or brown they care only that everyone must submit to the state senator sanders
[17:39.840 --> 17:45.600]  and I don't agree on everything he's an independent from Vermont but he asked he asked the NSA
[17:45.600 --> 17:51.760]  he says are you collecting records on congress and in characteristic arrogance you know what
[17:51.760 --> 17:57.320]  the NSA said they said congress is getting the same treatment everybody else is in other
[17:57.320 --> 18:01.640]  words yes yes and again yes they're spying on congress they're collecting our data as
[18:01.640 --> 18:10.200]  well digest exactly what that means if congress is spied upon without their permission who
[18:10.200 --> 18:16.360]  exactly is in charge of your government last week we discern we learned something new your
[18:16.360 --> 18:22.160]  senators in the middle of this we learned that the CIA is illegally searching the commuter
[18:22.160 --> 18:27.560]  the computers of the senate intelligence committee they're the ones supposed to be overseeing
[18:27.560 --> 18:35.640]  the CIA I don't know about you but that worries me if the CIA is spying on congress who exactly
[18:35.640 --> 18:44.080]  can or will stop them I look into the eyes of senators and I think I see real fear maybe
[18:44.080 --> 18:50.760]  it's just my imagination but I think I perceive fear of an intelligence community that's drunk
[18:50.760 --> 18:58.360]  with power unrepentant and unincline to relinquish power I'm honestly worried and concerned about
[18:58.360 --> 19:04.360]  who is truly in charge of our government now most of you have read the dystopian nightmares

[25:21.200 --> 25:26.320]  a war against alternative media that is the new media that's been announced run by the
[25:26.320 --> 25:33.880]  Pentagon four months ago announcing quote because of drudge as an exit that was the
[25:33.880 --> 25:39.080]  archetype example that they're gonna stop lying but engage with us domestically and
[25:39.080 --> 25:44.520]  work with us and reach out now that they've been authorized to engage in domestic propaganda
[25:44.520 --> 25:53.400]  do you see the mind control there no one believes us the Pentagon propaganda is not working domestically
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.480]  it's been illegal until now though we've been doing it so now we're going to up our game
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.480]  while saying don't run we are your friends if you put the article back up on screen
[26:02.480 --> 26:06.880]  I'll give it out and folks can see the Pentagon press briefing with the undersecretary of
[26:06.880 --> 26:13.600]  defense government promises to stop lying because of drudge report spotlight I told
[26:13.600 --> 26:19.160]  you that's a big deal and folks they're activating the FBI informants the the military people
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.840]  you're gonna see every dirty trick you could ever imagine come out of the woodwork because
[26:25.840 --> 26:30.360]  this is a full-on war I'm gonna come back to the next time we get to more of the Rand
[26:30.360 --> 26:37.520]  Paul speech the point is this is a full-on war and if they can target the Fox News and
[26:37.520 --> 26:43.760]  drudge report and info wars and this is who they're targeting and Associated Press and
[26:43.760 --> 26:48.960]  Greenwald at the Guardian with the NSA and with government analysts the Pentagon watching
[26:48.960 --> 26:52.800]  us which we told you years ago and is now confirmed in four-year documents last week
[26:52.800 --> 27:03.960]  dealing with drudge if they can't shut down the alternative media they will lose folks
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.680]  because they're killing the old dinosaur media right now and just making all the White House
[27:08.680 --> 27:13.720]  officials the anchors why not they're all a bunch of egomaniacs narcissists to begin
[27:13.720 --> 27:23.120]  with so I am almost speechless right now by the historic point that we've reached as a
[27:23.120 --> 27:30.960]  culture and as a society in fact guys we grab the video of Ellen and the audio because
[27:30.960 --> 27:38.480]  I want to play that later we have it let's let's go ahead and play literal North Korean
[27:38.480 --> 27:44.680]  level BS while I have you I think it's only fair we should talk about Obamacare and that
[27:44.680 --> 27:52.840]  rhymed well you know we've got about two weeks left till March 31st for people to sign up
[27:52.840 --> 27:57.920]  if you don't have health insurance right now you should go on healthcare.gov and especially
[27:57.920 --> 28:04.360]  all the moms out there who may have young people 26, 27 don't have health insurance
[28:04.360 --> 28:09.040]  but they think they're invincible and nothing's ever gonna happen you know what what we've
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.200]  said is you never know what life is gonna throw at the women the slight masters get
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.600]  health insurance get your kids signed up with the company store a hundred dollars a month
[28:17.600 --> 28:23.200]  or less oh yeah some cases less than your cell phone bill or your cable bill and it

[28:28.880 --> 28:36.920]  are gonna have decent care and particularly at this moment when a lot of young people
[28:36.920 --> 28:41.000]  as they come out and they're getting their first or second jobs they don't necessarily
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.920]  get a best benefit on the job now's the time to take a look at it but the website is now
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.400]  working healthcare.gov actually works the way it's supposed to and and I hope that people
[28:53.400 --> 28:58.400]  take advantage because if you don't sign up before March 31st then you won't be able to
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.480]  sign up again until November and I want to make sure that everybody has this opportunity
[29:02.480 --> 29:07.680]  now it's doing very very well I think it's surprised it had a rough start but you've

[37:30.440 --> 37:36.880]  the gods admired them that's what Elysium is so when I talk about Elysium I don't
[37:36.880 --> 37:41.880]  mean it is a real place for the New York Times does an article it's an idea and the elite
[37:41.880 --> 37:52.280]  believe they are building Elysium for themselves I want access to Elysium and I've been telling

[38:40.400 --> 38:46.240]  told here it is not disputed it is in thousands of publications books and magazines it is
[38:46.240 --> 38:55.840]  the religion publicly operating by the elite in their global technotronic era takeover
[38:55.840 --> 39:02.200]  and I do not like the people running at A B something that centralized will magnify their
[39:02.200 --> 39:08.800]  mistakes and their errors and it shutters humanity it is an absolute abomination what
[39:08.800 --> 39:16.800]  is being constructed with our energy our will our spirit our creativity to be put into
[39:16.800 --> 39:22.920]  this grid their building and once this grid is built ladies and gentlemen it is like the
[39:22.920 --> 39:34.160]  ring of Mordor the essence of humanity is being forged into this grid and if the ring
[39:34.160 --> 39:40.920]  is completed if the technotronic system the future predicting future controlling mega
[39:40.920 --> 39:50.680]  grid is completed and is forged in hate and in malice and in evil with the spirit of this
[39:50.680 --> 39:59.760]  world in it humanity will have to be thrown into the flame to purge the system you understand
[39:59.760 --> 40:09.960]  that no flesh would be spared and that's why God may have to intervene but we have to
[40:09.960 --> 40:19.280]  do the right thing in the final equation against this system and God will take us the rest
[40:19.280 --> 40:24.360]  of the way but these are the times that try men's souls you can say well what's the religious
[40:24.360 --> 40:27.720]  connotation why are you bringing that up because the elite are on a religious quest
[40:27.720 --> 40:34.480]  to become gods ray Kurzweil I don't believe in God yet I will become God I will resurrect
[40:34.480 --> 40:42.880]  my father we will step on those of you that do not join with us like a bug and even if
[40:42.880 --> 40:49.480]  you try to join with us you may not have access to the technology we may not let you have
[40:49.480 --> 40:54.160]  it I mean these are quotes I'm giving you paraphrase quotes of thousands by these people
[40:54.160 --> 40:57.720]  you go well that's just Ray Kurzweil you got the inventor of so many different computer
[40:57.720 --> 41:04.440]  systems the scanner the list goes on and on the head technology director of future projects
[41:04.440 --> 41:19.160]  at Google the decisions already been made now people ask me want to come over and watch
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.960]  the football game or watch a basketball game hey want to come sure I come over have a barbecue
[41:23.960 --> 41:28.600]  with a baseball game on the background but I sit there and see the propaganda I sit there
[41:28.600 --> 41:32.720]  is the manipulation I sit there and watch you know the kids walk by with their iPads
[41:32.720 --> 41:37.400]  or whatever already plugged into the matrix and I'm not judging anybody I just see us
[41:37.400 --> 41:45.840]  losing our humanity and the people driving this evolution as they call it are the equivalent
[41:45.840 --> 41:57.640]  of technotronic vampires and have great ill will towards humanity this is not some ring
[41:57.640 --> 42:05.680]  of power being forged to empower humanity and the human will towards good like the green
[42:05.680 --> 42:14.000]  lantern ring to use a archetypal lore this is a ring of evil a ring of betrayal a ring
[42:14.000 --> 42:30.480]  of death a ring of destruction a ring of darkness let's go back to the senator's speech at
[42:30.480 --> 42:36.880]  Berkeley senator Rand Paul historic speech saying we're all in this together we're all
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.360]  under attack even the Congress is spied on illegally those that are supposedly controlling
[42:42.360 --> 42:50.640]  the CIA ladies and gentlemen the CIA was funded by British intelligence out of OSS in 1945
[42:50.640 --> 43:01.160]  at the end of World War two the CIA is a eugenics body and has always been a eugenics body
[43:01.160 --> 43:05.040]  and has had many good people that have worked for a compartmentalized believing they were
[43:05.040 --> 43:12.400]  doing a great work but the CIA and the 1947 national security act is the coup against
[43:12.400 --> 43:18.440]  the legitimate government and the fact that Rand Paul in 2014 is now pointing out the
[43:18.440 --> 43:24.200]  dragon in the living room is the beginning of the end of this system and for those that
[43:24.200 --> 43:30.600]  are on power trips that work for the FBI defense intelligence CIA NSA North com space command
[43:30.600 --> 43:36.320]  all of it you go home and see your sick kids you know your families die and you know there's
[43:36.320 --> 43:40.720]  a lot of diseases you know you're being targeted to you didn't get a memo you didn't get protected
[43:40.720 --> 43:46.440]  you're not getting the ticket into Elysium the truth is nobody's getting a ticket if
[43:46.440 --> 43:56.480]  these people win it's they're being set up you know this is destructive I see a lot of
[43:56.480 --> 44:00.800]  government agents who are on power trips and feel like they've really arrived because they're
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.280]  a federal agent or corporate agent they have all this satisfaction you know that there's
[44:05.280 --> 44:09.840]  somebody and you're not somebody that's all dressed up play like when you were five years
[44:09.840 --> 44:15.960]  old dressed up like Superman you know deep down your slave you know deep down you're
[44:15.960 --> 44:21.720]  on a collision course you know deep down that it's an evil system and you think you're going
[44:21.720 --> 44:26.680]  to do good for your family going along with it no you're going to betray incrementally
[44:26.680 --> 44:32.240]  and destroy your family and in your gut you know that so you have to make the decision
[44:32.240 --> 44:37.080]  as a citizen or as a school teacher or as a police officer or an auto mechanic or a rancher
[44:37.080 --> 44:43.520]  or a farmer or a factory worker or a window washer or as a poet or as a radio talk show
[44:43.520 --> 44:51.840]  host or a writer or a filmmaker especially the artist you have to make the decision on
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.240]  whether you're going to fight and struggle or whether you're going to be nihilistic and
[44:55.240 --> 44:59.040]  say I don't care it's always been bad there's nothing I can do I'm just going to have a
[44:59.040 --> 45:06.160]  good time and go quietly into the night giving up your humanity giving up the animating contest
[45:06.160 --> 45:19.880]  you will find fulfillment you will find your instincts kicking in you will find true humanity
[45:19.880 --> 45:27.640]  when you join the fight for life when you taste it when you feel it when you love it
[45:27.640 --> 45:35.640]  when you commit to it all the doors will open all those evil doors will begin to close and
[45:35.640 --> 45:48.200]  you will find true fulfillment the choice is up to you out there everyone knows the
[45:48.200 --> 45:53.840]  course we're on is one of rack and ruin let's go back to the senator's speech the full speech
[45:53.840 --> 45:59.400]  is on info wars dot com in the most popular section on the right hand side ran paul concerned
[45:59.400 --> 46:06.520]  about who is truly in charge of our government and that question will expose the usurpers
[46:06.520 --> 46:12.560]  the occupiers and their collaborators and that will be the beginning of the end because
[46:12.560 --> 46:19.560]  when that simple realization is had no amount of technocracy no amount of propaganda no
[46:19.560 --> 46:29.320]  amount of entertainment shows with the president will reverse the destruction of the new world
[46:29.320 --> 46:37.400]  order let's go back to the senator last week a new revelation came out the nsa uses an
[46:37.400 --> 46:43.960]  automated system called turbine they've hacked into millions of computers the nsa is even
[46:43.960 --> 46:49.120]  posed as a fake facebook server you may have seen zuckerberg complaining to the president
[46:49.120 --> 46:55.000]  about this to infect computers if you have a computer you may well be under surveillance
[46:55.000 --> 47:00.480]  who knows they won't tell you your government collects information from every one of your
[47:00.480 --> 47:04.080]  phone it's all under surveillance that's what they're maintaining remember the warrant
[47:04.080 --> 47:09.640]  that snowden revealed every phone call from verizon was on the list your government stores
[47:09.640 --> 47:15.280]  your email so it can access it without a warrant your government claims the right to look at
[47:15.280 --> 47:23.040]  your every purchase online your government actually come claims that none of your digital
[47:23.040 --> 47:27.720]  records are protected by the fourth amendment listen very carefully to that they say they'll
[47:27.720 --> 47:32.880]  protect them but they say none of your records are protected by the fourth amendment this
[47:32.880 --> 47:39.440]  is something we're going to fight in court if you own a cell phone you are under surveillance
[47:39.440 --> 47:47.040]  I believe what you do on your cell phone is none of their damn business that's right
[47:47.040 --> 47:57.040]  call for their arrest high treason
[47:57.040 --> 48:03.480]  in the opening pages of Fahrenheit 451 the protagonist guy montag asks wasn't there
[48:03.480 --> 48:09.840]  a time when firemen used to put out fires they laugh and rebuke him and say everybody
[48:09.840 --> 48:16.240]  knows that firemen start fires montag knows this his father and grandfather had been firemen
[48:16.240 --> 48:21.760]  it had been his duty for many years to burn books he knew it was his duty but this day
[48:21.760 --> 48:27.520]  would be different montag arrives on the scene to do his job but he finds a woman who won't
[48:27.520 --> 48:34.080]  leave she stands on her porch as they pile the books about her but she won't leave undeterred
[48:34.080 --> 48:39.600]  montag proceeds with the other firemen to douse her and her books with kerosene the woman
[48:39.600 --> 48:45.440]  shouts out and goes them she's indignant that they would touch her books she refuses to
[48:45.440 --> 48:52.000]  leave the porch she says to them play the man master ridley today we will light such
[48:52.000 --> 48:58.200]  a candle by god's grace in england that it won't be soon forgotten they keep dousing
[48:58.200 --> 49:06.320]  over kerosene and she says it again play the man master ridley we will light such a candle
[49:06.320 --> 49:12.080]  in the book the references lost to the firemen as they simply do their job the references
[49:12.080 --> 49:17.360]  to the 16th century figure hugh latimer who literally became a human candle he was burned
[49:17.360 --> 49:23.440]  at the stake in 1555 for heresy his crime he wanted to promote the idea that the bible
[49:23.440 --> 49:28.880]  could be translated into english which the state forbade in the us today we're not yet
[49:28.880 --> 49:35.560]  burning people at the stake nor are we burning books yet but your government is interested
[49:35.560 --> 49:39.720]  in what you're reading they're interested in what you say on your phone calls they're
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.360]  interested in what you write in your emails or even if they say they're not interested
[49:44.360 --> 49:49.000]  they say the fourth amendment doesn't protect any of their persecuting the press the nsa
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.440]  is collecting the records of every american a year before snowden's revelations before
[49:55.440 --> 50:01.000]  snowden had his leaks i had heard that this was happening i had talked with ron wyden
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.180]  i'd seen some of the releases and i had heard that they were collecting an unprecedented
[50:05.180 --> 50:08.800]  amount of records they're building giant listeners reveal the number because they say it's a
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.440]  secret why the number is a secret i don't know this is from an ounce that a gazillion
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.680]  records were being collected because i knew that was a fake number and couldn't get they
[50:18.680 --> 50:24.960]  can't put me in jail for making up a number but i wanted to emphasize by using this fictitious
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.320]  number of gazillion i wanted the american public to know that the actual number of communication
[50:30.320 --> 50:35.520]  that's right we'll make it more government was all about walking all over us folks they

[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:23.520]  500 years ago in the transatlantic slave trade or in the slave trade run by the arabs that
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:30.400]  goes back to the time of egypt from the time of egypt they set women up above the men read
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:38.560]  the old testament only in the slave pens not not not actually in the free people and
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.960]  the women are told we're not going to kill your men if you keep track of them and spy

[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:45.960]  master from anybody well it's the same deal that's all it is in fact we have the article
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:51.720]  it's up on dredgerport.com 10 ways real feminism is being attacked with all the documents how
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:58.160]  the cia runs modern fake feminism to destroy women on record just like i said declassified
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:07.240]  they put out degenerate art to try to lower standards and again you want to put degenerate
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.360]  art out more power to you my point is that they make things that are degenerate and ugly
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:16.680]  beautiful and hold it up i was talking to a high level record executive high level
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:23.400]  this high level as it gets because i've heard this before about subna redstone and viocom
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:29.480]  and mtv and i was talking to this super high level one of the top three or four record
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:35.000]  executives in the country a household name for anybody in the real music industry and
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.240]  i said you know i heard that things in the mid nineties that radical gangster rap wasn't
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:46.480]  even popular and it was force fed via mtv and i also heard that things like maryland
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.680]  manson that wasn't popular about murdering children and devil worship and all this mindless
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.320]  stuff you know was force fed him vomiting on stage and cutting himself to screw up the
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:02.280]  white kids and i said is it true that that that mtv ran that for years and people rejected
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:07.640]  both gangster rap and that but that it was a directive of summoner redstone to put that
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:14.520]  out and he said yes and by the way how do you even know about that i mean it's a guy
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:22.720]  search engine cia put out degenerate art or declassified cia put out ugly art and starting
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:28.360]  in the sixties and you go why why put out something ugly to say that a rembrandt isn't
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:42.080]  good or a picasso or a leonardo da Vinci beto is not beautiful even though it's transcendental
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:48.040]  you know maryland manson vomiting and saying smells like children and singing about kidnapping
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.960]  kids out of backyards how about i sing about clubbing your head in i've ever seen in my
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.840]  backyard the point is how about that how about if you were real tough oh you're tough grab
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.840]  you know to see about grabbing kids how about how about you sing about getting in the ring
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:07.960]  with me you can have a baseball bat and i get one too you're so such a killer you're so
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:17.000]  powerful would be too powerful with my hands wrapped around your little chicken neck the
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:24.840]  whole point is that they are psychically attacking us here let me see if i can search it and find
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:33.040]  it because i get obsessed with it google for the nsa search engine i'm gonna say cia art
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:46.200]  that should bring it up uh promoted uh promoted ugly i think that was what it was okay go
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.800]  ahead and punch my computer up got it right here for you how the cia secretly funded abstract
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.000]  expressionism during the cold war but if you read it was actually ugly art to confuse people
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:04.360]  not just abstract expressionism so even this is a psi op and again that was to get people
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:11.920]  away from old pro cultural art into having no set values or no set standard for what
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:20.520]  was the highest levels of beauty and there's glorious dynum when you type in cia promoted
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:26.280]  ugly art look there's glorious dynum right there talk about ugly art talk about taking
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:33.000]  a nobody who's a cia operative and putting them up there's cell a culture of filthy death
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.440]  on everyone in abortion and that ugly hag where you know all these shirts saying i had
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.160]  an abortion and talks about it and some of the feminist talk about how it's like a sacrifice

[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:54.760]  a deep cover neocon state department operative and it was all a stage deal to discredit rt
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:58.120]  and that's what they do they they approach reporters or infiltrate reporters into what
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:05.160]  is seen as non anglo-american establishment media and then and then they don't even hide
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:10.520]  the fact that she's tied into it and just did it as a stunt trying to sell the global

[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:12.720]  full of piranhas everyone loves being thrown into a fat of piranhas and then ellen goes

[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.880]  channel throwing your children into woodchipers here it is well i have you i think it's only
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:31.840]  uh fair we should talk about obama care and that rhymed well you make a joke we've got
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.680]  about two weeks left till march thirty first for people to sign up if you don't have health
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.680]  insurance right now you should go on health care dot gov and especially all the moms out
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:47.400]  there who may have young people twenty six twenty seven don't have health insurance but
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.880]  they think they're invincible and nothing's ever going to happen to them what what we've
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.040]  said is you never know what life is going to throw at you you can at this point get
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:02.720]  health insurance for uh a hundred dollars a month or less in some cases less than your
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:07.920]  cell phone bill or your uh cable bill and it gives you some financial security it gives
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:13.560]  moms some mental security he just repeats that lie over and over again to have decent care
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.800]  and you know particularly at this moment when moms move to north korea they'll give you
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.000]  total security and they're getting their first or second jobs they don't necessarily get
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.160]  a best benefit they're young they're dumb time to take a look at it you're gonna go
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:33.560]  far from it the website is now working health care dot gov actually uh works the way it's
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:39.120]  supposed to that's not true and i i hope that people take advantage because lies sign up
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.200]  before march thirty first then you won't be able to sign up again until november and i
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.440]  want to make sure that everybody has this opportunity now it's doing very very well
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.160]  i think it's surprised it had a rough start but you've got five million people that have
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:29:00.720]  signed up so far which is a lot of people that have signed up so it's successful and
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.800]  why why is there a deadline why is there not uh just an open ended where i think it is
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:09.680]  important to have health care and a lot of people think oh i'll be fine and like you
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.640]  said you never know and then she says they should be thankful that's enough i mean we're
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:23.040]  gonna blow the planet up yeah foreign banks wrote a screw about it yeah oh oh yeah everything
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:30.080]  is awesome when you're part of a cult everything is awesome when you're a total chump everything

[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.480]  party we're trying to put them in reeducation centers get the brigades ready troops you will
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:29.480]  be facing the tea party and the christian evangelicals they may have to be dealt with
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:35.400]  and you're gonna have to pull triggers if things go south we will be confiscating their firearms
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:42.840]  games i mean you know this is what's going on as they mass the illegal evil paramilitary domestic
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.280]  force but i'm not trying to scare people before i go to your phone calls because the good news is
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.760]  the globalists are smart but they miscalculate just because they've got war games and all these
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.880]  sophisticated systems doesn't mean that they can understand it or doesn't mean that the elite pulling
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:09.320]  this trigger and calling the shots are following a program that would win because when you expand
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:17.320]  on all of this and when you look at this what do you think it does when you march the military in
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:22.520]  and tell them George washington's bad wouldn't be welcoming today's army that he founded and bad
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.880]  mouth guys and john deer caps in training drills and literally tell them the tea party or terrorist
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.440]  and christians or terrorist i mean that's mainstream news what do you think the military does
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:40.360]  they go oh my gosh alex jones was right i mean the ultimate psi op is the truth
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:46.520]  the ultimate psychological warfare the ace of spades is the truth and we have the weapon we
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:51.720]  have the truth we don't have to spin or lie or deceive to beat these people we just gotta tell
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.600]  the truth but in a world of universal deceit that is a revolutionary act quote george arwell
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.840]  and that's what ran paul did yesterday at berkeley that's getting so much attention he said we have
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:04.520]  a shadow government running everything who watches the watchers is totally illegal we've
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.400]  caught them lying over and over again and they are setting brush fires in the minds of liberty
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:13.720]  that will burn down their new old order and it's none of their damn business to spy on our cell
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:19.160]  phones it's illegal and you know what that's the type of language you should use i'm not a very
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:24.680]  profane person and i shouldn't be because i've got a repertoire of semantical dialect that will
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:32.680]  allow me to create a full spectrum palette of verbal utterances that can transfer any
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:39.800]  sophisticated understanding that i wish to a greater public as an orator or rater
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:46.600]  animated by liberty but sometimes you got to say get out of our bleep and business
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:54.040]  at a certain point this is out of control at a certain point you got to turn it back and all
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:58.520]  they're doing is racing headlong over hoping they can take over hoping they can race in the finish
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:06.680]  line before we get before we wake everybody up think about how radical my show was 15 16 17
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:11.000]  18 19 years ago five years ago two years ago it was still seems incredibly radical
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.680]  it's not seen that that radical we got big stations all over the country 50 000 watt
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:23.640]  am 100 000 watt fm's turning us on all over the place our numbers across the web just continue
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:29.000]  to surge and grow and explode and people are like man i bet he's on a power trip no it's the opposite
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:33.960]  it's like flying in over a german industrial site in a b17 and you're flying to the biggest
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:40.600]  flat cloud you've ever seen but i got to tell you i with pleasure i stare into it i love it i'm ready

[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:29.640]  for cheating and lying and stealing and manipulating you think that's how you win you win in the end
[01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:34.200]  by being honorable you win in the end by doing what you say you're going to do you win in the end

[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:13.480]  two things to talk with you today about according to the ellen degenerous situation there this
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:20.840]  is a sigh of against what is the most populist gender in our country well women of course so
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:27.000]  they're obviously targeting women because they're the ones that are going to be the most to sign up
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.200]  for this obama care now they're the most pliable and sweet and manipulative the globalist are
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:39.480]  praying on women and children like all villains did right that's that's the plan let's talk about
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:50.920]  liberty what is liberty alex liberty is a pseudonym america amelie law term for limited controlled
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:57.720]  granted permission i don't agree with with with i mean i like um some of the folks out there
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:07.160]  that have put out that idea but i've actually looked into it uh deeply and uh i don't agree
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:13.400]  with people that claim liberty in admiralty on ships is that you're given liberty to go
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:18.040]  because you can do whatever you want during that period but in the bible it says where there is
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.840]  the spirit of the lord there is liberty liberty and guys give me the full quote on liberty pull
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:28.920]  up webster's for folks i don't agree with that particular view of jordan maxwell i he is he is
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:33.480]  the progenitor of that idea and i'm not trying to disagree with you sir but i just do not agree
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:40.200]  you can call it freedom you can call it justice you can call it uh being a free man call whatever
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:46.440]  you want names are just names the globalists have taken every term and perverted it you know uh
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:52.040]  every symbol and perverted it the state or condition of people who are able to act and speak freely
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:46:00.920]  the power to do or choose what you want a political right the the quality or state of being free
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:06.600]  but but go ahead and make your point i won't interrupt anymore well that's what i i've seen
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:11.400]  i've served a little bit of time in the military and it's consistent it goes along with that because
[01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:15.160]  you don't have liberty in the military because you've waived your rights to a certain extent
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.120]  so you're given the liberty so yes military admiralty liberty is limited you are correct
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:27.240]  right but i want freedom outright freedom and that's what everyone should want and that's what
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:33.480]  you should want and that's what i stand for and i spread the message every day to get us moving
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:41.400]  towards freedom and that's all i gotta say on that that's my take on that sir well god bless you
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:45.720]  what do you think of ellen de generes and he's suddenly on every entertainment show out there
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.520]  and just saying obama care obama care it's so great it cuts your prices when that's a lie and her
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:56.040]  saying everyone loves it and we have to thank you kim jung on i mean adolf i mean stalin i mean you
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:02.840]  have made the the birds tweet i mean this is a sycophantic display well we're going after you the
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:07.640]  youth of america because the you know young people in the particular group that they're looking at
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.880]  somewhere between 15 and 30 are most impressionable so naturally they're going to go after the most
[01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:17.320]  populist tender in the country because you know they outnumber males three to one so obviously
[01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:21.480]  those are the ones that they they want to target because you know they're the greatest populist
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:28.520]  well 15 51 to 52 percent of the births are female that's a mammalian system mammal wide
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:32.440]  because it's a good thing for the species to have more women than the you know the males
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.440]  because it ups the population numbers and then of course women live on average about five years
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.240]  longer than men in the united states so i think the total population of women last time i checked
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:46.760]  is 56 percent of the north american or us population very interesting points sir i appreciate your

[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:13.160]  have asked you that question have been you said yes not too many people know about it yeah most of
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:18.200]  the new tv's have cameras and microphones in them and there are patterns that they're able
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:25.720]  with some of the screens through data over power line or over their digital connection
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:33.400]  that the screen itself is a composite uh i similar to a dragonfly's eye but digital uh elaborate on
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:37.560]  that for folks that don't know the light bulbs are coming out that actually watch you as well

[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:50.840]  was going to take the dot off the computer screen and just make the screen itself the camera and
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:56.040]  people freaked about it because oh i can't put black tape over the whole screen so they didn't say
[01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:03.960]  but anything over 64 bit is hd and is two-way communication and video yeah most police haven't
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  been briefed on that yet the threat fusion centers of the federalization areas where

[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.080]  it's fun to be like in a jazz lounge
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:46.920]  sit back with some friends listen to music like that
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:51.560]  there's so much good in the world that's why we're ravenous against corruption because look it's
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:57.720]  taken over we want our security back and security comes from having a government on a short leash
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:04.120]  not the people on a short leash let's talk to john in california i didn't see that he disagreed
[01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:07.160]  or i would have gone to you up front sorry i wouldn't read in the screen right john
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:14.520]  go ahead john in california that's okay alex uh point number one ran paul you did read his
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:20.280]  op-ed piece in time but we're established saber rattling for the bankers you know i've seen some
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:24.280]  of his quotes where he's met with some of the neocons and said stuff like his father said you
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:28.440]  know war attack will defend ourselves and we're for a defense but we need to cut defense spending
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:34.120]  and we need to cut all foreign aid and so he has played some politics with the israel lobbying people
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:41.560]  so that he can get lined up to run for president but i mean he's the guy that shot down the gun
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:47.080]  ban i mean on so many fronts and he's an example to a whole new crop of libertarians
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:53.400]  to take over the republican party so but no i mean i didn't read his whole piece in time
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:56.920]  or newsweek or whatever it was i did see some excerpts of it i'll give us your take on it
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:04.280]  okay well i did read it and uh he left himself a little out like he condemns russia but we
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:08.680]  shouldn't get involved okay but you know what we got to hold their feet to the fire because the
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:14.280]  reason why he's popular with the people not with the bankers is because he's speaking to when he
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:20.520]  speaks the truth and he claims that the russians invaded the ukraine which is patently false they
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:26.600]  didn't invade the ukraine uh they were already in the Crimea which was really which was formally
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:30.680]  a part of yeah let me stop you here's the deal there everybody's spending it to putans had a
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.480]  big victory he's not he's had a defeat okay the west just took 90 plus percent of the country it's
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.600]  like 93 percent uh and it's turning it over to the EU and they're gonna loot the country
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:45.000]  and the russians have always basically had crummy air right he was part of russia for hundreds of
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.920]  years i get all that and i didn't read his piece in there about that he knows the public can't
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:56.920]  even find ukraine on the map so he's like i get it was not good russia came in there but we don't
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:01.400]  need to do anything because he's not going to have him in the presidential run saying he works for
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:06.360]  the russkis or something they're already saying that about his dad so no i didn't see his statements
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:12.200]  on that i know he said we shouldn't be al-qaeda's air force i know he was against syria i mean look
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:19.480]  he's good so my issue is i know ram paul i've been interviewing ram paul since his dad ran for congress
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:25.640]  again in 1996 and they would say hey you just had you know the ram paul on when you have ram paul on
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:30.680]  days before the election because i was in their district his district used to come up into south
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:36.680]  austin and i was on a big fm you know back then only on one station in 96 that went into his whole
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.480]  district and so they wanted they like coming on my show i mean nobody knew who ram paul was hardly
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:45.800]  then he'd run for president once the libertarian but he was one tenth one one hundred probably what
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:51.000]  he is now and you know i'm i'm proud of the fact that i've been with ron paul since day one back in
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:56.120]  congress in 1996 and i've been supportive of ram paul i can get the senator on but i said look no
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:01.000]  thanks last time he came on he called me to come on because it creates such a national firestorm
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:07.160]  and i want him i want him to have a good better stuff for the presidential run and so uh you know
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:13.960]  fine don't come on my show so i guess you could say i'm playing politics there as well uh but i'm
[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:18.760]  not mincing words you know i'm kind of the attack dog that'll say it all and then i make a wedge
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:26.360]  and open it up for people like the senator to then almost say everything i'm saying i i mean you
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:31.640]  get what i'm saying that i mean who do you like better ram paul or dian feinstein ram paul could
[01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:37.080]  you hold me over i got two more points you know uh yeah you can finish your point but then i got
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:46.280]  to get to everybody else like shawna and rick and chili rabbit tricks for kids and communications radio

[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:21.480]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:34.040]  the reason rand paul's speech has been so well received at berkeley was because he had a lot
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:38.680]  of basic truths in it and it was a highbrow speech compared to something obama would give were like
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:45.480]  you get free health care you slit wrists and then you get cheap health care and then you get
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:50.840]  and your mommy make you but still compared to what's really going on it was like a mr roger
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:01:00.280]  speech he gave about their shadow government scare congress they spy and blackmail us we need you to
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:09.560]  come together to help us get country free again so of course he goes russia not perfect and take
[02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:17.400]  over ukraine we not need fight with russia though because you have to understand he he
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:23.640]  understands the general public literally cannot tie their shoelaces and so that was a highbrow
[02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:28.360]  speech i mean in the future if stuff continues being able to tie your shoelaces will be a sign
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:38.920]  of being the smartest man in the world president kamacho eight times smackdown champion international
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:46.840]  porn superstar and president of the united states to quote a diocracy that's getting pretty close to

[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:57.240]  voice of god that's what they call that that that announcers voice uh let's go ahead and go to john

[02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:37.640]  idea she's a very lovely young woman sir that is outrageous idea now actually we've had the idea
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:44.760]  to get women maybe in like 50s uh you know style dresses because i think that's really cool that's
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:49.560]  in style right now too and i don't follow fads unless i agree with the fad i think that's a
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:55.640]  permanent fad we need to recreate the fifties dress i like it uh and and have a bunch of women in
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.520]  like in classic fifties kitchens and stuff or like you know outfishing

[02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:12.440]  talking about that uh we saw that gun rally i saw on the sky it was in like it looked like she'd be
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:18.280]  a fifties pent up we need to call her up we need to get like 12 women and come up with a 2000 and
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:25.560]  uh 15 pro gun calendar because that is how we sell liberty it's showing a real powerful woman armed

[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:10.440]  i like listening to him when he's uh doing his own show on the howard stern channel
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:15.400]  and i like going on howard stern because you can tell when the show is big and when it's not i got
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.160]  a huge response when i go on howard stern show or the howard stern channel people say well that's
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:23.640]  got a lot of sex and crazy stuff on it look folks when i'm on there i'm talking about the new world

[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:41.240]  your show but it's great to hear you on stern it's seen as the fact that our information is going
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:49.640]  mainline and it shows that on the nsa all of it we're starting to win to go on these shows and
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:54.200]  not just have it be a joke to go on these shows and have people go you know that makes sense
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:58.680]  that's how you culturally turn the tide we don't want to just stay in the basement
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:05.800]  and you know be the outsiders we want to get people elected we want to be take america back to

[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:19.960]  and we're going to demand it so we're going to talk to him in just a moment uh really huge story
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:26.920]  reporters rehearsing questions with the white house and drudge report dot com has been hammering
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:30.920]  that we've been hammering it as well they've been scripting this for a long time it's come out but
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:36.680]  now it's confirmed ap reporters are going public j carney makes him give them the questions beforehand
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.760]  they must stand instead of sitting all these little rules now they're talking about getting rid of the
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:44.920]  press conferences all together that's the only reason they're talking about how staged it is
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:55.000]  that's what's going on here so continuing uh carney is denying knowing questions in advance
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:01.800]  he's lying of course and it's a flashback obama takes a range query from huff post during press
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:06.680]  conference remember he got caught doing it before bought house asked for emails to participate in
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:12.600]  michelle o's china trip fear of coverage was the quote ellen degenerous with obama says
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:19.720]  everyone's very grateful for obama care everyone loves it let me give you the exact quote here

[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:32.920]  and you know it's a big critic of bush folks i mean i've never seen such a cult like devotion
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:39.480]  and we played the video last hour quote obama cares doing very very well i think everybody's
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:46.680]  very grateful you did this everyone is you heard it she said so and they're shifting from news
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:51.640]  propaganda to just blanketing entertainment with the bilge by the way we told you they're
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:56.600]  going to launch domestic drones here it is being announced pentagon moving ahead with x51 hypersonic

[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:19.560]  uh that is just some of what we're going to be breaking down now we're going to be covering
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:25.560]  more of all of this but speaking of obama care that is foreign banker takeover of the economy
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:31.720]  care this article is up on info wars dot com and guys make me play this get the video of
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:35.000]  this i mean i know we have it but people aren't going to believe it till i play it it's up on
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.600]  info wars dot com obama care provider knows when clients visit the bathroom that's even more than
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:47.160]  the santa claus knows he knows when you've been bad he knows when you've been good wherever
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:52.440]  however the song goes so we're gonna be playing that after our guest leaves us tell them medicine
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.840]  since there's a revolutionized medicine and to be in the toilet watching everything you do so
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:01.720]  we're gonna be talking about that i mean big brother in 1984 the bathroom he at least thought
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:07.000]  didn't have cameras in it but i mean 1984 was a libertarian wonderland compared to this dystopic
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.240]  nightmare they're building now riley martin i think could describe himself better than i can
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:17.400]  riley martin dot com he's a frequent guest over the years on coast to coast a m dot com
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:26.840]  and he has his own show on xm 101 on mondays or the time may have changed but i tune in here
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:32.600]  when they rear it sometimes uh sometimes i'm on the shows and i don't get to here last time i was
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:39.080]  on with him during the howard stern news segment but uh and i was surprised because i already mainly
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:45.240]  talk about you know extraterrestrials and stuff he has a very nice voice very very very entertaining
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:50.680]  person so so i like listening to him when i do hearing kind of a fan you could say but then i
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:55.480]  we got him the subject of ukraine and he seemed extremely well informed because he was on he was
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:14:02.760]  on the panel with me on leverman live so let's go to riley martin and tell us about growing up and then
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.400]  they get his take on the world and where everything is going mr martin it's good to have you on with
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:16.040]  us it's good to be here i think uh yeah okay tell them that my show is now on uh seven o'clock

[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:33.320]  tell us about yourself uh i was uh as i've told you before i was born in the born in the south
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:41.640]  and uh my family moved out of the state of mississippi into arkansas when i was just an
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:51.480]  infant but there in 1953 as i've told you uh i saw lights above the river for three nights in a row
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:59.720]  and on the third night i heard a voice telling me get up friend martin and come out we have
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:09.240]  need to speak with you and was obama there laying golden eggs uh no not at the time nonetheless uh i
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:16.280]  had two brothers that slept in the same big room uh that obviously began but they i could not awaken
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:23.960]  them for some reason and i got up and went out to uh to go to this light down by the river
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:32.200]  as i came to the river came out of a cane break down on the river in a big circle i saw this
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:39.640]  ship i could feel it uh you know static electricity and all that and my dog brown boy had went with me
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:48.680]  presently the the dome of the ship with the salsa the dome of it cleared up and i saw two
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:56.760]  people the children people standing there looking down at me and uh i said to myself hey i better
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:03.240]  get out of here and when i said that before i could make a move i was hit with a blue white light
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:09.720]  now are you sure they weren't cps workers well they might be now but they weren't then you know
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:16.760]  presently that was the light being down from the bottom of the ship and i saw two small beings
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:27.000]  uh i learned later that uh his name is oh quiet ten didn't want i called him ten and the female
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:35.160]  who was with him were called only sayer one but i called her another and uh they picked me up and say
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:42.760]  my dog brown boy one of the most noble dogs in the world he decided that he did not want to get
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:48.760]  involved so i i look back and i saw him as he was flapping as he went back up the hill
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:57.240]  and uh the bastard left me excuse my language uh so oh listen sir sir listen i don't deny that you
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:02.360]  say the story happened to you and we don't really do ufo's on the show but i i do like listening to
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:08.280]  you if i think everybody knows why you're a very interesting person but but now you have your show
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:12.920]  over the years for for quite a while on the on the howard stern network and and what i always do is
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:17.720]  when people have me on i end up having them on or have their people on howard says he will come on
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:23.000]  sometime when he's got the time uh but regardless give me your view now so that's what you're known
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:30.360]  for is your ufo experiences your view just because you're kind of a sample uh or a focus group person
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:36.200]  to have on i'd like to talk to somebody outside the box what is your view of geopolitics of obama
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:44.360]  uh of what's happening in the ukraine uh well the ukraine uh many of the people in south
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:54.440]  southeastern ukraine are a version extraction so to speak uh whether uh however now in the north
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:18:02.680]  east western part and in the north central part of it are more or less leaning towards the west
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:13.080]  europe and what have you and so if they wanted to detach themselves from uh the east and go with uh
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:22.760]  russia or what have you then i suppose according to the laws of averages they have the uh you
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:29.720]  know ability to do so whether it was a good move or not remains to be seen however when you cook it
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:40.200]  and boil it all down uh america and the rest of you it does not be a basic but care too much about
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:48.920]  how the people and the premier is treated but that the oil flow that comes across their territory
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:55.080]  does not get disrupted by the russians and by the way you said this three weeks ago when it
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:59.480]  wasn't even really in the news when it was first breaking and you you were informed i like that so
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.800]  you're like this informed smart guy on so many topics but you say you were taken on a spaceship
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:09.000]  my whole issue is i've never seen anything like that i know some of the uh
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:14.920]  astronauts say they saw flying saucers out at the moon and stuff it's very interesting
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:19.160]  but i do know that my uncle and my dad's brother the one that's still alive uh one time he was
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.360]  running from one house together to get more dominoes because they were having domino games
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:28.280]  was about 12 uh you know the adults were and he saw three flying saucers that were like rainbow
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:33.880]  colored right above the trees and he doesn't make stuff up so uh who knows but maybe that
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:41.960]  was our freedom flying away uh riley martin yeah well i mean i uh i don't think you have anything
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:50.120]  to fear uh from the people in the sky but you do have something to fear from uh on capitol hill
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:57.320]  and and the criminal in other places all right well we're gonna come back and um talk about obama
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:03.800]  is he a space alien did you know that golden silver contain healing properties it's true

[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:32.840]  funded by nato in the u.s. government to continue the three-plus year attack on syria they've even
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:38.280]  used the weapons to take part of iraq back from the iraqi government i mean i'm just so sick of it
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:43.640]  when i'm a suspect as a terrorist as every other american is and i'm told i've got to give my liberty
[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:48.280]  up and criminal elements of the government are openly funding the threat so they can take my
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:55.160]  freedom it's so elementary and i'm sick of it in the next segment we're going to go to shana and rick
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:25:01.880]  and edward and lucas and john uh with riley martin and i didn't get riley martin on to make fun of
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:06.120]  him uh you know he may be telling the truth this happened to him i don't even i don't get into these
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:11.240]  subjects i just think it's interesting he's got a you know big show on xm with howard stern and i
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:15.080]  hear him talk about politics and stuff he's pretty informed on i agree with him on quite a bit and
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:20.760]  then he goes off with sam when he was a kid he was basically picked up by aliens uh it's just crazy
[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:25.480]  so i just thought it'd be fun to get him on the show and you know kind of cross promote there because
[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:31.160]  i i don't ever just have one-way stuff with people i like to reciprocate and i find rally
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:36.760]  to be interesting but riley what do you make of the state of the world what do you make of the
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:42.120]  nsa and all the things that are going on what do you make of syria where do you think it's all going
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:50.040]  well i think that the earth in particular all over this world right now there are wars and
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:57.720]  rumors of wars takeovers and terrorist groups and things of this nature in this country then when
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:04.120]  we take in the factory and say the co-brothers the co-brothers the pharmaceutical companies
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:11.400]  in wall street and what have you our politicians especially on the republican side has been
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:20.120]  bought paid and sold and then owned a hardened soul and what have you it is far easier to
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:29.400]  buy a politician than it is to do the right thing sure but riley riley you're informed i mean i mean
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.720]  i mean quite frankly that's a whole leftist deal to claim that the co-brothers run everything
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:39.480]  the co-brothers finance bill clinton they they fund both sides i don't think they're good guys either
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:47.400]  is yes certainly i mean i'm just saying this is the thing it is easy to buy politicians
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:57.000]  than it is to uh to you know to give the society a break on the various things that no i know but
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.480]  i mean do you agree do you agree with ellen degenerous that everybody loves obama care and we should
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:10.360]  thank obama i don't see anything really wrong with the kid this is a country wherein for up until
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:19.080]  recently only those with really money could get quality health care he is trying to uh even
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:24.600]  though the republicans are all against him he is trying to bring this thing to an even
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:33.960]  stephen wherein regardless of your economical prosperity everyone has access affordable access
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:38.520]  to health care i don't think there's anything wrong with that yeah but that's what he says it's
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:43.400]  actually written by foreign insurance companies the same ones that finance the republican party
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:48.440]  and i'm just saying there's this throwaway line about the co-brothers who are funding both sides
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:54.440]  and do a lot of bad stuff i never debate that it's kind of a leftist throwaway fake intellectual
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:58.360]  thing that i just constantly hear that if i don't want to turn my guns in i must work for the
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:02.280]  co-brothers uh or if i don't want to have an abortion i must work for the co-brothers
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:05.240]  or if i don't want to shut down free speech i must i mean i mean what do you think about
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.440]  george soros because let me tell you george soros he he he's he he's involved in all sorts of nasty
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:17.320]  stuff well i mean otherwise there are many up there on capital fields who are involved in a lot of
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:26.440]  nasty stuff i've mentioned the co-brothers only because they are the foremost among the big handers
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:32.200]  so to speak now that's warren buffett david rockefeller uh bella melinda gage british world
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:38.520]  family the rothschilds i mean the rothschilds have the carbon exchange riley that we're gonna all
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:46.600]  have to pay money into to travel or do anything well okay now uh you know i am certainly not
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:56.360]  as far up upon the the conspiracy and things like that as you are nonetheless i'm seeing that uh
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:04.040]  when i'm thinking of representation whatsoever the little that we have left
[02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:13.720]  is that uh i'm pretty much on obama's side i can think of nobody else uh certainly not
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:21.000]  dummy trump or any of the rest of them or who would uh not even tell us how far than we are being
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:26.440]  jammed at this time in the history of the world well i guess obama makes us feel good while we're
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:30.680]  having our throat slit i hear what you're saying i want to come back and take some calls i want
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:36.040]  you elaborate on that and i have another question and i'm somewhat serious about this what is the
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:42.120]  health care like on the spaceship that you were taking up on and because i'm serious i mean maybe
[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:47.640]  like the free health care maybe the flying saucers exist as well because the free health care doesn't
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:56.440]  exist folks we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:05.080]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on health care

[02:33:58.920 --> 02:34:04.920]  getting the reporters having special reports we air here um had another talk show host on i just
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:10.760]  don't want to do standard talk radio here and i don't want to get into fight with riley um
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:16.840]  i want to reach out to him and you know talk to somebody that is an obama supporter in fact i'm
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:20.200]  remembering why i wanted to get him on a few weeks ago now it was how he was informed on
[02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:24.520]  a bunch of stuff that we were talking about on the news on the howard stern show
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:32.200]  channel uh but that then he would be an obama supporter and i wanted to ask him about obama
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:37.880]  care and things like that and you're hearing it he's buying what obama's saying and look it doesn't
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:43.720]  mean then that we go vote for george bush again the republicans help write obama care it's raising
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:47.960]  payroll taxes it's doing all these things and i want to go to a bunch of calls for you now riley
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:52.360]  they'll be all over the map but you can comment on what they say uh but and then i want to talk
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:35:01.160]  about your book briefly but i mean really you're obviously a smart guy and uh i'm trying to understand
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:05.640]  why you think obama care is a good deal because if you actually read the bill it's a nightmare
[02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:12.600]  it's a giant wealth transfer social engineering government corporate takeover of health care
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:17.400]  from an already screwed up system i'm not debating that uh i mean you think obama's got your best
[02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:24.360]  interest at heart uh for the most part i think he has my best interest at heart but the man is
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:31.640]  swimming against the current uh with all of the dissension uh on capital deal against him
[02:35:31.640 --> 02:35:36.760]  in the form of the republicans and what have you and but he's doing the best he can
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:44.920]  usually utilizing what he has has access to to do okay now how many times have you been around
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:54.840]  aliens uh i have i've been uh had four face-to-face meetings over the years over the years now if you
[02:35:54.840 --> 02:36:01.160]  read my book the coming of ten uh you will find that all of these things that are coming about
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:10.840]  today i have spoken off and warned off uh over the last 40 50 years and what have you but you
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:20.280]  have to use your own judgment on that we are not alone good man well listen i just wanted to get
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:25.480]  an average obama supporter on here and uh you know get your i wouldn't say your average but
[02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:31.000]  you know kind of an interesting fella uh to tell us i'm gonna be honest with you i think obama
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:35.400]  people don't really know his providence or where he came from is he really from kenya
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:41.960]  he's really from hawaii all of that uh well i don't give a damn if he came from st lewitt's i was
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:51.160]  gonna ask you is did obama really come from a pod uh no i don't think so um you know he's human
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:56.760]  like you and me what did that what did hillary i mean the aliens tell you about obama uh they
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:02.520]  haven't uh spoke bad against them or anything of that nature what have the aliens told you
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:10.520]  uh well i think they like him they do they do yeah as as the investor of all other
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:19.720]  should we create alien transgender bathrooms because uh what was it facebook just put out
[02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:26.280]  like 50 new sexual sexual genres and your racist if you're against them should we create special
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:35.400]  bathrooms for transvestite aliens well my goodness um as with any cognizant species they are
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:45.080]  various different transgender and every other thing that is uh among them as well as among humans
[02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:51.240]  well if the aliens are real then should we create alien bathrooms as they feel more comfortable
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:57.400]  uh well i mean otherwise uh they have bathrooms and they work very well
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:03.080]  oh tell me about alien health care did you ever did they give you any medical exams
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:10.520]  well the aliens have been here since pre-biblical times uh back during the time of this fable at
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:17.720]  lanterns to merrier and up through history they have visited various different people
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:22.840]  cultures and places all over the world i was told that rachel madow is actually an alien and that
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:29.240]  is a wig she's actually a gray alien and that is a wig on her head well i wouldn't i wouldn't
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:36.360]  know about that y'all or his head yeah what is the proper what is the name of the aliens you know
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:46.120]  again be obvious is rachel madow a beobian uh beobians come in all skin colors from olive black
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:52.120]  church all white and all the colors in between much like the human race human species
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:59.560]  i hear you i just i'm blown away right now right are there any aliens in the u.s government
[02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:07.240]  uh i i'm sure that since they were the ones who turned man from a hunter-gatherer
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:17.160]  homo sapien biped into what we call humans over time that uh the bloodline of those aliens are
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:23.960]  in every race green in color of mankind i mean oh so we're part alien oh every one of us is part
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:33.240]  alien uh there's 80 of your dna we do not know what it is yet anyway well that's true let me ask
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:42.840]  you a question um well just just never mind i i just don't know what to say anymore so i'm actually
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:48.760]  an alien is what you're saying what do you think that we're all part of some fractional part of
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:56.520]  alien let me ask you a question what do you think of david eich david eich uh well i mean i'm not
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:02.760]  very familiar with this what does he do are there any aliens that aren't friendly are those just
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:11.320]  republicans well well actually uh we we need not worried about the intentions of the aliens because
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:20.840]  we have nothing that they really want other than our being creativity and we are on the way to
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:28.520]  ultimately he said if i did not visit you you would surely someday visit me and therefore i
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:36.120]  gotta keep an eye on you so many words and what have you uh but uh but uh man is getting along
[02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:43.400]  he's no slouch he's back engineered much of the things that he's found that the aliens have lost
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:49.400]  all right well we got riley martin um the howard stern network here with us and um i just thought
[02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:53.400]  it'd be weird to get him on and it's been interesting let's take a few phone calls you know i know
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:58.360]  about aliens uh abducting people but i know the cps is doing it and shana from kentucky called
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:02.840]  in about that uh you called in a few months ago and they were trying to take your child uh because
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:06.760]  i guess they said that you didn't have a big enough refrigerator or something uh how's that going
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.560]  now shana you're on the air with riley martin well i was going to tell you really quick and i
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:17.320]  actually have something to say to him if i can if i tell you this if that's okay yeah go ahead okay
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:23.400]  first i want to let you know that um kentucky tonight on april 21st i'm going to be debating
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:30.040]  map seven and then on october the um well let me see the date here so what are you running for office
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:36.520]  are you running for office oh yes and oh no it's october 13th i'll be debating the um alison
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:41.080]  letterman grimes alex they try to keep me from running they came after my daughter well listen
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:45.080]  the best way for you to run for office and expose the cps is doing is announce what you're running
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:50.360]  for and where or it does nothing well once i announced on your show that i was going to kick
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:55.800]  some butt they came after me i had to keep quiet the day that i went to file i was just praying
[02:41:55.800 --> 02:42:01.720]  that they wouldn't come target me again and i left home early i filed and literally within an hour
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:07.560]  after the reporters all interviewed me the lady called me frantic to get a hold of me so she could
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:14.680]  close my case yeah no that's right exactly standing up against them at first they'll they'll threaten
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:20.120]  you but if you keep persevering 99 percent of the time in my experience if you stay cool they will
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:26.200]  run because they've got more kids to grab and and so they've got more families to ruin and so
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:31.400]  they're going to want to move on to to easier targets so that's good news i appreciate i
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:36.520]  appreciate you i'm going to move on now what do you think of the state grabbing children you know
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:41.000]  native americans by the millions had their children grabbed and sent to reeducation centers
[02:42:41.720 --> 02:42:46.920]  in the 1880s and 90s that was the first eugenics program here uh why do you think that loving
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:54.120]  government ever changed rally martin to a loving helper oh well my goodness i do not uh trust those
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:43:02.920]  in power under any circumstances uh i know that they're up to call burglary anyhow nonetheless i
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:09.240]  do not think that the trouble that beset this world is from anywhere other than this world
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:18.760]  oh my goodness uh anybody listening to you now who is uh 60 years old or less tell me
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:27.240]  have they ever seen a winter like this ever before i haven't and i'm 67 um well there's
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:32.920]  a lot of geo engineering going on and they say it's one of the coldest years in about 120 years
[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:38.120]  but no the earth used to be a uh colder in the cycle now it got a little bit warmer now it's
[02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:44.280]  getting colder again do you think we should pay all gore carbon tax will that fix it uh well i mean
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:54.120]  otherwise uh we are putting millions of tons of uh hydro fluorocarbons uh and various other
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:59.080]  cars but you know that a volcano one big volcano puts out more than all humans do in a year well
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:08.360]  my goodness oh yeah perhaps so nonetheless we are adding to the situation of the decline
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:15.160]  of the planet earth and well i don't i mean i don't deny that yeah yeah we are definitely but
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:20.920]  i mean paying carbon taxes and shutting down our clean coal power plants when all the dirty ones
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:28.280]  are in china that makes things worse not better well of course however how do you think of al gore
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:34.200]  do you believe it may be true that he's part man part bear part pig half bear half man half pig
[02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:44.120]  uh well i don't know uh i'm i'm pretty sure rush member are safety uh but uh uh so so riley when
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:50.440]  it comes down to it you're on the democratic team and and and and no i'm on the team of uh doing
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.840]  the right thing for the american people whatsoever well i don't want to fight with you about it
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:45:01.720]  here let's take another call rick and or again you're on the air go ahead hi thanks Alex i'm a
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:08.360]  new listener i just recently woke up and i'm still kind of ignorant to what's going on but i'm kind
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:14.760]  of slowly picking up on it and i'm kind of tortured every day about the thought of my son's future
[02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:20.520]  i have a 15 month old son and i'm really scared about the way things are going and and well
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:27.080]  that's a normal instinct to be having i'm losing hope but uh no no don't lose hope get involved in
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:32.840]  the fight start fighting tyranny in your area and then um that's what'll put you on the road to victory
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:40.760]  i kind of lost hope when i saw last year or the year before ron paul was coming out of the the run
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:47.400]  for president um but now we got uh rand paul so i'm really uh happy that you know i like his policies
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:54.840]  i like what he's doing and um i was just wondering uh like uh riley had said earlier uh you know
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:46:00.760]  politicians are easily you know manipulated and true you don't get all your hope in rand paul
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:06.360]  he is just an expression of a libertarian takeover of the republicans and someone who'll help recruit
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:12.040]  other people for the cause of true free market systems and so the fact that ron paul didn't win
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:18.360]  twice he built a movement we built a movement we invested in an opposition wars aren't won even in a
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:23.480]  decade the act of resistance is the answer rick so i want you to be more positive i appreciate your
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:29.720]  call riley i guess you don't like rand paul or ron paul huh uh well not particularly no
[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:38.920]  uh and uh very few politicians do i like you like obama though uh well i mean i like him better
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:45.080]  than any other alternative i could think of at the present time yes what did you think about
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:51.080]  jamie fox saying that obama was our lord and savior uh well i don't keep up with all of the
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:58.280]  b movie makers and things about nature it's basically their opinions are basically a material to me
[02:46:59.080 --> 02:47:05.960]  uh i know that i'm sitting here in new jersey freezing my ass off when all in early it wouldn't
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:11.000]  be that way and it's never been that way before that's right let me read you an article at rt
[02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:15.080]  which is why i like them they cover stuff that our media won't by the way we broke that story
[02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:21.000]  about the uh atf violating the federal order and rating that that receiver manufacturer
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:26.840]  that was on fox yesterday here's our t four-year-old texas girl taken from parents
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:32.280]  and heavily drugged by child protective services the parents of a four-year-old girl
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:36.920]  are outraged was sweet little girl after their daughter was placed under the care of child
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:43.960]  protective services and then heavily medicated with psyche psychotropic drugs and it goes on
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.040]  about how they grabbed the girl for no reason and then did it they are they're absolutely
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:51.640]  assaulting these children why do you think the government likes to grab little kids when they
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:58.440]  cry for mommy say it's mentally ill and drug them well you must bear in mind that there are
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:05.160]  uh some mummies and daddies who are not worthy to have those kids i know that statistically
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:10.360]  riley yes somebody's got to do something i'm saying that the child care people are perfect
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:16.760]  oh yeah but uh if you add it up pound for pound then it's probably best that they took her and
[02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:20.680]  instead of leaving her in a situation she was in but you're just randomly don't even know about
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.160]  the case and you're just saying pound for pound pound for pound you're seven times more likely
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:31.000]  to be abused in cps custody uh than than than you are anywhere else it's the most dangerous place
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:38.440]  i've never uh detected that in all the years and what have you they are not certainly not perfect
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:42.440]  and they make me think that's a justice department number well their mistakes are hidden and they're
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:47.720]  allowed to do it i mean what do you think of the average cps child being on seven psychotropic drugs
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:57.720]  should we be drugging two three and four year olds uh in this day and time uh children may suffer
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:04.680]  psychosomatic problems and think about nature and uh now it could probably be better done
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:11.640]  in state of drugs if they were raised in the right way uh and uh get the proper nurse
[02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:16.440]  riley they warehouse the children like it's a giant alien spaceship with a bunch of captured
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:22.840]  goodies on board i mean otherwise you got to take me to the warehouse um uh i'm not uh
[02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:30.280]  i'm not the state run orphanages are famous for their enemy of those who for the most part
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:36.520]  mean well towards the children i don't think that they just automatically take them to torture
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:42.200]  and think of this nature no i don't well the food and drug administration it says even said she
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:47.320]  shouldn't be given the drugs but they do it three year olds given psychotropic and anti-psychotic
[02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:55.400]  drugs where there's no reason for it well okay maybe there isn't any reason in some cases here
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:50:03.160]  in there but all the ABC news reports in texas but all in all together the child care people
[02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:10.360]  uh of well meaning and takes care of the kids oh they do let me tell you they take really good
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:15.160]  care let me read this in texas foster children are 53 more times likely to be prescribed five
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:21.400]  or more psychiatric medications at the same time the non foster children ABC news reveals
[02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:29.960]  well yeah no doubt that is so however the average child does not need them because
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:35.320]  they don't have various psychosomatic problems and thank you that state board said they have bad
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:40.840]  gene pools um which is eugenics but listen riley martin riley martin dot com your books there

[02:54:17.240 --> 02:54:22.520]  there's one in my bedroom go to the bathroom every time i flush without someone knowing i
[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:29.800]  didn't know that how closely they were watching me until i received a phone call like whoa okay the
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:36.200]  60 year old diabetic and ms patients home is outfitted by insurer humana with sensors that
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:43.560]  keep track of when she opens her medicine cabinet her fridge sleeps walks and uses the bathroom
[02:54:43.560 --> 02:54:50.920]  a break in routine is an early sign of trouble and if it becomes unusual i would get a phone call
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:56.120]  mrs marshall are you all right do we need to call your sister the sensors are monitored by workers
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:01.400]  at a humana building in carillon in panellas county but she also gets a monthly visit from
[02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:06.840]  a field agent the sensors allow her to live in her own apartment instead of at an assisted living
[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:13.080]  facility when it made me feel wonderful to be one of us especially living alone telehassee is
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:19.240]  debating rules for all kinds of telemedicine how much can remote doctors charge when should a webcam
[02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:26.440]  exam be allowed how will medicaid reimbursement work as technology becomes easier and cuts costs
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:32.840]  our dr joe cautions i really think it's going to revolutionize medicine in so many ways but again
[02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:37.960]  i think that there's nothing that is going to replace the face-to-face in this case marshall
[02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:44.040]  says that knowing that she's being watched helps her feel calm which she hopes will lead to an even
[02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:52.520]  longer life if your mind is clear eventually you're gonna feel a little healthier the bills have been
[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:56.600]  hotly debated in town all right i told you about this i'm not bragging i don't know about a decade
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:04.600]  ago under the smart grid global takeover everything you do will be watched you won't be able to get
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:11.320]  a house under a g21 rules unless it's under surveillance you will pay for it all and it's
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:16.360]  already going in all the appliances remember the cia director patrice a couple years ago said your
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:22.840]  toaster is watching you so it's not just old people that opt into this and watson's article
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:28.840]  explains that's up on info wars dot com that you have to do this under obama care this is
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:34.200]  what the insurance companies are going to force and it gets rid of family it gets rid of the
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:38.760]  idea of your neighbors coming and checking on the nice old lady oh don't worry the government's doing
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:43.960]  it and then they can decide oh you're too old now or you run out of money now we can basically take
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:50.200]  you to the death panel and euthanize you and again it has good uses on the surface except the system
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:57.640]  is evil and has been using it to control people and that's what i'm getting at obama care provider
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:02.840]  knows when clients visit the bathroom and you know i didn't mean to be mean to riley martin
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:10.520]  but when i got him on i mean just that you know the guy is just totally believing in obama and
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:15.320]  believing in the cps and believing in the system when history shows that it's the opposite
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:20.840]  finally uh ladies and gentlemen the nightly news is coming up tonight they're going to be covering

[03:00:12.680 --> 03:00:21.720]  be he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[03:00:24.040 --> 03:00:28.760]  all right folks let's move quick to your phone calls adward in new york thanks for holding
[03:00:28.760 --> 03:00:36.440]  her on the air all right uh hello mr alex jones hey buddy i um i wish to discuss a rather disturbing
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:40.920]  and rarely mentioned aspect of obama care since we're on the topic today avoid a minute everybody
[03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:45.480]  loves it ellen is interested so yeah well we should thank her for this one too though thank
[03:00:45.480 --> 03:00:52.520]  obama for this and uh what a concern is the right to trial by jury um as a prelude i have often told
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:58.680]  people that when the right to trial by jury so long as it remains intact the people really have no
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:01:05.080]  one else but themselves to blame for tyrannical uh and abuse of government uh as thomas jefferson
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:10.520]  said i consider trial by jury uh the only anchor yet imagined by man by which a government can be
[03:01:10.520 --> 03:01:14.680]  held to the principles of the constitution no you're right it turns into administrative
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:20.040]  waves a lot of the juries allows them to use your data it is a giant gang rape but according to uh
[03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:27.080]  you know riley martin he believes in flying saucers it's wonderful well it's it's unbelievable
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:33.800]  as you said how this man trusts the system so well when the entire the entire uh theme of the
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:38.520]  enlightenment is not the trust the government is to keep yourself free from government abuse and
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:43.880]  tyranny that's what the whole constitution has that that's what exactly people get it go why don't
[03:01:43.880 --> 03:01:47.960]  you trust the system that's crazy it's like why don't you want to put gasoline on yourself and
[03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:55.160]  light it i mean it it is the it is so crazy go ahead all right so um all right so i just want
[03:01:55.160 --> 03:02:00.440]  to talk about trial by jury and obama care so now when the supreme court redefined the obama
[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:06.600]  care penalty is a tax um which places under the jurisdiction of the taxing authority to the tax
[03:02:06.600 --> 03:02:13.880]  courts uh that redefinition automatically voided our right to trial by jury if we're being penalized
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:21.320]  under the obama care tax and what i find even more disturbing that this precedent um it establishes
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:27.560]  a platform from which the authoritarian left and right can build and strengthen their unlawful
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:33.320]  empire all they need to do now is attach physical penalties as long as they're absent of jail time
[03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:38.840]  or any other type of punishments and they can subvert the jury system and just persecute everybody
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:48.120]  who refuses to conform right into into submission that's what obama care is as a total social
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:53.880]  engineering takeover makes your medical records totally public they can swap all your data like
[03:02:53.880 --> 03:03:02.680]  baseball cards the bill has got 13 000 pages of riders and addendums to it and it's so horrible
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:07.240]  i can't even believe it's law but it doesn't matter the average gullible democrat
[03:03:09.720 --> 03:03:15.000]  literally will buy into anything well on another thing on top of obama care i just
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:19.320]  wanted to talk about that real quick but that's one of the most disturbing implications um
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:25.160]  is that there's a lot of democrats now that are being of their own report as a mainstream
[03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:29.880]  media of course but i know from people at work who used to be democrats or still identify as
[03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:36.440]  democrats many of us because i work at caterhole we were cut back to 30 hours already i have been
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:42.680]  mobbed by people apologizing to me in austin saying i just got cut to 30 or less hours and
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:48.920]  just saw their payroll tax go up and they're going bankrupt because of it people now um
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:55.240]  frances at my caterhole we used to work but riley says obama's nice so you know everything's fine
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:04:01.400]  we got over time we made extra money and tips now we're back to 30 hours now many of us have
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:07.560]  to go find a second job and now it was written to impoverish the working class period and make
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:13.000]  you give up and go on welfare i mean they admit that that that's not debatable they admit it's
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:18.360]  meant to wreck health care and impoverish the working class and wreck a social safety net
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:24.120]  of a free market go ahead all right uh anything more we'll talk about trial and juries let me think
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:28.120]  well no listen i appreciate it okay good good listen i'm gonna do even more overdrive because
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:32.520]  i'm gonna get to lucas and abe and silly rabbit we've got a caller called silly rabbit you got to
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:38.840]  go into overdrive and talk to silly rabbit no i mean democrats sit there i'm not even a republican
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:44.280]  though i agree with more of what libertarian side of that's doing i mean it's not my opinion
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:49.480]  it was written by vicious hardcore banks that go into places like africa and murder whole villages
[03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:54.520]  for their property i mean the globalists put dictatorships and all over the world they are

[03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:19.240]  we're in overdrive right now for another 15 minutes or so we're taking your phone calls
[03:08:19.240 --> 03:08:27.320]  on a host of issues on this thursday worldwide transmission lucas in arizona thanks for holding
[03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:32.600]  you want to talk about rand paul go ahead hi thank you nice to finally talk to you alex
[03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:39.240]  um i have three things to say uh the first one was i i think i can understand why you're confused
[03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:45.720]  about the ellen degenerate thing and it's because ellen doesn't view poor people or sick people people
[03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:54.200]  with pre-existing conditions as people so that's why she knows that everyone is thankful that obama
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:09:01.400]  brought in obama care i think i think that's where we're not getting it you know to ellen everyone
[03:09:01.400 --> 03:09:08.520]  that matters is thankful all the glamorous fake liberal authoritarians living in their own little
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:15.800]  bubble world um yeah i guess everyone does love obama and everybody loves obama care in in in
[03:09:15.800 --> 03:09:22.920]  her circle of fantasy land exactly exactly i mean look at her twitter pic how many you know how many
[03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:28.040]  let's say people of color are in that sort of twitter pic i mean i think we know where she
[03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:33.000]  hangs out and who she hangs out with so i mean my issue is how do you call yourself liberal and
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:38.680]  raise payroll taxes on poor people and and and increase the prices and do all the horrible
[03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:43.640]  things obama care does and then sit there and parade around like you're wonderful people
[03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:48.680]  and then the con game works so well that poor democrats as they go bankrupt believe it
[03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:53.480]  well yeah that's that's the stockholm syndrome that's exactly the stockholm syndrome that you're
[03:09:53.480 --> 03:09:58.680]  speaking of that's they have to keep it up if they stop now the prisoners and like they'll
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:04.760]  start getting restless so they they'll never give up the tagline they'll never ever stop because to
[03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:10.520]  do so even though they know this is failing it is just going to they don't know where to go they
[03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:19.640]  have nowhere else to go nowhere to back down to uh my second point was um uh kind of about ran paul
[03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:24.760]  uh i and i wanted to say that i like ryan martin i thought he was very interesting uh even to talk
[03:10:24.760 --> 03:10:31.480]  about the alien uh a more realistic uh i guess we could say idea of the alien is of course john
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:37.240]  carpenter's the thing which you have spoken about before and how it goes around and it becomes what
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:44.360]  we are in order to basically eat us where it's food and it takes over the entire infrastructure
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:51.480]  so that it becomes the reality it's like a thing that becomes the entire world an artificial habitat
[03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:57.800]  so we don't know any better it's it's more advanced than john carpenter's thing of course but see
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:03.480]  that's the other thing about that is that anybody at any time any movement like you said before
[03:11:03.480 --> 03:11:09.640]  can be taken over it can be amalgamated into the system so that gentleman that called earlier
[03:11:09.640 --> 03:11:15.240]  who was talking about the op ed that ran paul wrote in time um i read it you know and i i read the
[03:11:15.240 --> 03:11:22.600]  whole thing and it it's a little worrisome it's not just you know america good russia bad it's
[03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:30.040]  things like i would do what obama is doing only harder stronger and like a man and you know there's
[03:11:30.040 --> 03:11:34.680]  a number of different articles on info wars dot com that anyone can look up that show that economically
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:40.600]  that's not going to work well i'll say this that's also diametrically opposed to what his
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:45.080]  father is saying and i know he's his own man but his father's certainly correct about what he's saying
[03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:50.120]  i didn't see that i'll have to read it i've seen some quotes out of it that is disturbing uh and
[03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:54.840]  that's more than just you know politically uh not fighting with people on the military issue
[03:11:54.840 --> 03:12:00.280]  that's that's that's giving into it all and that's certainly positioning for the presidential run
[03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:05.320]  and the argument is well that's how he gets in and then you know was able to i mean that's what
[03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:09.240]  the liberals would do that's what the socialists would do is they would they would say they were
[03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:14.760]  anti-war and then be pro war he would say he's pro war and then be anti-war i'll have to go
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:20.840]  read the full quotes and to get into that thank you i'll check it out and i sure hope um look
[03:12:20.840 --> 03:12:30.120]  his advisors do know how politically ignorant the average american is and that the new cold war
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:36.360]  starting you know he said hey i don't want wars from what i heard i mean i haven't read it yet
[03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:40.280]  i've seen his other quotes i don't want to have a war with him but you know russia shouldn't be
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:47.400]  doing this russia didn't do this and again it's not siding with russia it's like if the sun came
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:51.640]  up the morning and i said there's the sun it's not siding with the sun the sun is there i'm not
[03:12:51.640 --> 03:12:58.200]  endorsing russia i'm not talking about you know them being better than us i'm saying nato and the
[03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:06.040]  eu went and started this with soros and overthrew the country and took over 90 of it and are acting
[03:13:06.040 --> 03:13:10.440]  like it's a victory for putin grabbing some of their military bases on the border and some naval
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:18.200]  bases i mean it's a defeat for russia russia was starting to dominate ukraine politically and so
[03:13:18.200 --> 03:13:23.240]  the argument is hey we don't want russia to start expanding again though west helped fund russia's
[03:13:23.240 --> 03:13:28.680]  expansion under the soviet it helped put the bolshevik sin in 1917 that's why none of that holds
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:34.600]  water when you know different neocons come out and say alex jones and ron paul worked for the russians
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:41.320]  because they're again i mean what the trotsky aides that you work for came out of russia
[03:13:42.200 --> 03:13:49.240]  and they are the neocons let's talk to john but i mean basically that's what ram paul's afraid of
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:55.800]  he wants to be positioned to not be his pop and to say i'm tough on russia it's pure politics
[03:13:56.520 --> 03:14:00.520]  and the danger is you start playing politics you will become what you're posing is
[03:14:00.520 --> 03:14:10.680]  so whatever uh let's go ahead and talk to john in carolina go ahead north carolina
[03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:17.720]  hi john i just want to comment on another um former of the former naval intelligence officer
[03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:22.120]  that you had in on sunday just past sunday yeah he said he was and i think he was telling the truth
[03:14:22.120 --> 03:14:27.000]  he sounded very informed i'm prior uh army intelligence i did my training in forward
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:34.600]  to arizona i want to speak you know geopolitically in the same kind of topic um if you look recently
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:39.400]  you know they had articles about how they're trying to um expedite the permits for natural gas
[03:14:39.400 --> 03:14:45.240]  export to europe and japan because you know europe and japan they have high natural gas prices
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:50.440]  so that there's a big absolutely we should be loading those super tankers up with gas
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.720]  and shipping it to russia and they can cut off those pipelines
[03:14:53.720 --> 03:14:59.240]  um it would actually make my family money because my family's not in oil but i do have
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:03.000]  family that has like little gas wells and stuff they're all over texas and you basically don't
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:07.240]  even get any money from them your taxes go up on the property and you barely make any money
[03:15:07.240 --> 03:15:13.720]  so so i would actually make money off shutting down those russian um gas lines or my family would
[03:15:13.720 --> 03:15:21.080]  but i'm still against it but yes it would be a boom uh for the gas industry um there's also
[03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:25.400]  anti oil i should add because they're in competition with it and coal i would make money or my family
[03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:30.360]  would if we shut coal down because every time i'm pro coal just because it's half our power and
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:36.600]  cheap and clean now with the new uh scrubbers it's like you must be in coal i i don't own one coal
[03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:42.200]  stock none of my family does but i will disclose that i've got most of my family in each texas
[03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:45.720]  has got a few gas wells on their property you know you make like a thousand dollars a month
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:51.160]  off of them or something but then turn back around your property taxes go up you know ten thousand
[03:15:51.160 --> 03:15:55.720]  twenty thousand dollars a year it's it's literally break even it's it's incredible but but i'm sorry
[03:15:55.720 --> 03:16:01.880]  i digress go ahead um um but my point is that um you know russia when you look at the pipelines i
[03:16:01.880 --> 03:16:07.640]  lived in the ching hillan john um province which is the northeast province of china and you know
[03:16:07.640 --> 03:16:13.720]  that's the province where japan first invaded they went through hartman which is um um about two hours
[03:16:13.720 --> 03:16:18.680]  from the ching the ching and the ching's oil fields are the third largest in the world
[03:16:18.680 --> 03:16:23.560]  a lot of people don't know that and they have huge pipelines from the ching to russia because you
[03:16:23.560 --> 03:16:30.440]  know the ching is you know right by the um cybern high it's about four hours by flight i'd say to
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:35.960]  to the russian border and then so you take that that's the you know the right leg of the tripod
[03:16:35.960 --> 03:16:44.280]  okay of russia as far as pipeline so the middle tripod is the middle east subsequently syria and
[03:16:44.280 --> 03:16:48.680]  russia and china the reason we didn't go into syria is because you know they have russia and
[03:16:48.680 --> 03:16:56.200]  china a huge oil contract with syria so there was lots of pressure from um on america from
[03:16:56.200 --> 03:17:00.120]  russia and china because they didn't want those contracts basically to be seized because if we
[03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:04.440]  would have invaded syria we basically would have taken their oil okay so that's the middle
[03:17:04.440 --> 03:17:10.840]  part of the tripod okay and it's interesting that right after this you train thing israel bombs
[03:17:10.840 --> 03:17:15.400]  syria right it's kind of like okay this is the next you know leg that we're going after
[03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:21.960]  and i'm not anti is israel i'm not you know i don't know you shouldn't have to preface it
[03:17:21.960 --> 03:17:25.880]  to point out israel's grand strategy that fits into the larger global
[03:17:25.880 --> 03:17:30.680]  anglo-american strategy it's a fact it's stated leslie clark's giving speeches about it all the
[03:17:30.680 --> 03:17:36.200]  countries that are going to be invaded they got to take out syria to then take out iran it's just
[03:17:36.200 --> 03:17:41.960]  a fact and again it's not that syria is good or iran's good it's that the west is doing this
[03:17:41.960 --> 03:17:47.800]  offensively to control the resources not even to give them to the american people that'd be
[03:17:47.800 --> 03:17:54.840]  bad enough we are all being preyed on just like the syrians just like the iranians israel uses
[03:17:54.840 --> 03:18:01.400]  endless war to be able to take israeli's liberty our government uses endless war to take our liberty
[03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:06.200]  the german government uses the terror threat to take liberty it's all a giant power grab excuse
[03:18:08.040 --> 03:18:14.920]  yeah and so basically you know so ukraine sorry i'm trying to stay focused what's the
[03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:19.560]  bottom line geopolitically how are things going for the new world order the bottom line geopolitically
[03:18:19.560 --> 03:18:24.600]  is the european union and soros they've already gotten ukraine they've got 90 percent of ukraine
[03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:29.320]  so that peg of the leg has been taken yeah that was a huge huge it was a huge victory there's a
[03:18:29.320 --> 03:18:36.040]  huge victory so what this does is it may make the corporations money but what it does is it raises
[03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:42.440]  the price of natural gas for america okay so it's that's the american people as far as natural gas
[03:18:42.440 --> 03:18:49.080]  this helps helps helps my dad though and it makes russia and it makes russia force to raise their
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:55.240]  prices on china because if europe if the europe axis is taken out as far as the pipeline russia
[03:18:55.240 --> 03:19:01.400]  has to raise their prices on china so that puts pressure on china which is why did that hold on
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:07.320]  japan china thing has been going on is they're putting pressure on china to join the european
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:13.080]  union i do because if you put pressure on russia they have to raise their prices of their oil
[03:19:13.080 --> 03:19:19.240]  because they don't understand they're taking out they're taking out russia's dominance uh in central
[03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:25.320]  asia and into western europe eastern europe uh in petroleum goods and that's exactly the grand
[03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:29.800]  chess board and that's the grand strategy 1997 it's the big dibersensky grand chess board really
[03:19:29.800 --> 03:19:33.720]  great points skipping this network break going to the bottom of the hour here um
[03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:39.800]  all right so let's go to the next caller here abe in california go ahead
[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:48.520]  please be upon you earthlings i am a jedi and they bring a message of pure light and i just
[03:19:48.520 --> 03:19:55.560]  want to give some insight into our universal destination um about about the whole thing
[03:19:55.560 --> 03:20:00.440]  that you were talking about oh i like obama all that stuff i think you might be uh kind of basing
[03:20:00.440 --> 03:20:06.120]  that on the recent chatteling that i was talking about obama being a worker of light i have no idea
[03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:11.400]  whether that's true or not and god only knows if that's true when i see obama uh telling everybody
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:16.280]  out of his administration and then you know uh whatever this guy's got to prove something
[03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:21.720]  to prove that but that's not why i'm calling okay what i'm calling is is i want to give insight
[03:20:21.720 --> 03:20:26.840]  into the master's master you know we we see we see what's going on geopolitically we see what
[03:20:26.840 --> 03:20:32.600]  their their genders are now why do they do it what's the what's the motive here who the who the heck in
[03:20:32.600 --> 03:20:39.000]  their right mind would want to do such things to anybody well i'll tell you these people are empty
[03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:45.640]  okay these people serve the the shift word because let's just use the jedi analogy because it's the
[03:20:45.640 --> 03:20:53.080]  easiest okay the suits are empty okay they're empty beings their souls have no charge anymore
[03:20:53.080 --> 03:20:59.880]  okay they are empty beings meaning they are deviated far from zero they're in the negative okay
[03:20:59.880 --> 03:21:09.080]  okay they need suffering anger jealousy all these things they need them to to fill an empty void
[03:21:09.080 --> 03:21:15.000]  that they have accumulated doing all the evil things that they've done okay you are born in the
[03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:19.240]  positive just above all right well listen i gotta jump because i promise get to all these callers
[03:21:19.240 --> 03:21:24.120]  by the by the end of this segment but but i hear you it's very interesting uh let's talk to silly
[03:21:24.120 --> 03:21:31.160]  rabbit than lori and others silly rabbit in wisconsin you're on the air go ahead uh what's
[03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:38.680]  up doc i got a question for you kind of as a devil's advocate question uh is there any justification
[03:21:38.680 --> 03:21:46.600]  you could give let's say where the earth would hang in balance or you know uh imminent invasion
[03:21:46.600 --> 03:21:52.920]  or conquest by transdimensional creatures that would warrant this uh or william we have been
[03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:58.600]  invaded by transdimensional creatures and then they're led by janet napolitano you don't think
[03:21:58.600 --> 03:22:04.440]  that's an actual human do you no i i definitely do not i definitely do not it's the transdimensional
[03:22:04.440 --> 03:22:09.080]  creatures that want the global government to conquer us and they pose as hillary clinton
[03:22:09.720 --> 03:22:17.160]  and as janet napolitano and as janet rino and as rachel maddow and the reason again is they don't
[03:22:17.160 --> 03:22:21.240]  have a lot of different earth suit outfits they only have a few that they vary a little bit that's
[03:22:21.240 --> 03:22:28.920]  why they all look so similar madeline albright okay well uh so you would say that there is
[03:22:28.920 --> 03:22:32.760]  justification for use of stuff sir goblins are real sir goblins are real
[03:22:38.040 --> 03:22:43.160]  hello yeah you know i think you're being sarcastic so that's why i was being sarcastic back i'm
[03:22:43.160 --> 03:22:51.400]  going to tell the new york times i do not actually believe that um that janet napolitano is a alien
[03:22:52.120 --> 03:22:56.520]  though i think your spirit is very alien to humanity i do believe michelle obama is a
[03:22:56.520 --> 03:23:00.280]  giant stamping turtle so i wanted to be clear about all that i've been on air a little bit
[03:23:00.280 --> 03:23:06.520]  too long a little bit dingy here but but caller of course there's ways to unify humanity of course
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:11.480]  there's ways to have a global federation and to have humanity work together the problem is the
[03:23:11.480 --> 03:23:17.080]  global government they're bringing in is designed to bring in eugenics and dominate and reduce
[03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:24.520]  population forcibly and so that's why i'm against it if you had some global federation where you
[03:23:24.520 --> 03:23:29.080]  couldn't give up your sovereignty but countries and people if they wanted to could could vote to
[03:23:29.080 --> 03:23:35.160]  like aid each other in in larger projects that that's wonderful and that's how they sell global
[03:23:35.160 --> 03:23:44.760]  governance is this come by odd deal that's not what's going on pardon me i totally agree with you
[03:23:44.760 --> 03:23:49.880]  okay good good good because your audio was faded down i'm sorry yeah i agree with you um
[03:23:51.080 --> 03:23:57.000]  and i i i somewhat agree with riley what holly was saying with uh alien and i know you don't
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:03.640]  believe uh the whole link to geopolitics but i'm sure you're pretty aware that the new world order
[03:24:03.640 --> 03:24:08.760]  and all those one percenters they're very much so into their cult and now in the age where we're
[03:24:08.760 --> 03:24:14.200]  living with the occult these alien and trans dimensional creature stories and science are
[03:24:14.200 --> 03:24:18.760]  emerging together with fonts and sciences well i'll hear you i gotta jump let me just say this
[03:24:18.760 --> 03:24:23.480]  okay i kind of had rally on as a joke and then now as people are talking about aliens that that
[03:24:23.480 --> 03:24:31.880]  that was a joke folks okay and and look regardless there are people that steal what they've got and
[03:24:31.880 --> 03:24:38.120]  get in gangs and con people and produce bs and lies to make themselves the heroes you see it in
[03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:44.360]  losers everywhere then there's people that actually build things or super good-looking or great poets
[03:24:44.360 --> 03:24:49.800]  or great musicians or great mathematicians or great artisans who become successful because
[03:24:49.800 --> 03:24:55.960]  they have great minds and they join with others to build a better civilization that's the kind of
[03:24:55.960 --> 03:25:03.320]  people i'm looking for that's the kind of people that we build a free will society based on honor
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:07.880]  and individualism or we build a collective society built on nightmares that's the two
[03:25:07.880 --> 03:25:12.120]  different types of civilizations and there's variants of both and all civilizations a mix
[03:25:14.600 --> 03:25:17.960]  but i can't just give somebody a throwaway line that saves the whole world
[03:25:17.960 --> 03:25:25.960]  like they say in caddyshack under galunga
[03:25:48.280 --> 03:25:51.960]  all
