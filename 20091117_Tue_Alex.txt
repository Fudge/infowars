[00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:09.569]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:11.150]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.051]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:16.893]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.893 --> 00:00:20.955]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:39.166]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:44.768]  It is the 17th day of November on this Tuesday edition.
[00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:46.088]  17th day of November 2009.
[00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:53.231]  Hard to believe that this year is very long in the tooth.
[00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:57.633]  Seems like it was in diapers just five minutes ago.
[00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:01.394]  But it's definitely growing a long beard.
[00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.895]  And I want to open the phones up throughout
[00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:32.923]  The entire four-hour transmission today to talk about cap and trade, to talk about Al Gore is being confronted everywhere, to discuss the plunging of the dollar, the explosion of gold, the open announcements of world government, the police state, and just a giant smattering of incredibly important news and information that we're going to be going over today.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:43.919]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:45.779]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:52.401]  Also, we're going to be playing some phone calls that have come in in the last few days to the listener comment line.
[00:01:52.401 --> 00:02:01.383]  You get 60 seconds to ask your question, make your point, to disagree with me, to agree, to tell us about an activist events coming up.
[00:02:01.383 --> 00:02:03.004]  We pick the most focused
[00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.630]  Uh, clips that we find and play them.
[00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.432]  A memo to those that are leaving like 20, 30 messages a day and serializing what they're saying, we're not going to be able to play that.
[00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:20.354]  And so if you don't want your rant played, leave 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 or in one case over 60 messages.
[00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:24.735]  It's really hard for our limited staff to go through those and that's penalizing others.
[00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:25.216]  But 512-646-4444, 512-646-4444 is the
[00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:41.742]  Number that folks are welcome to call in on and leave your one minute rant to get live on air.
[00:02:41.742 --> 00:02:41.922]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:51.947]  And it's going to be like Washington Journal here, at least in the first hour.
[00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:53.247]  I'm just going to go to your calls.
[00:02:53.247 --> 00:03:02.729]  And I want to particularly hear particular headlines out of the news, paper, or from television, or different pieces of legislation, or different happenings in your area.
[00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:09.350]  And I'm going to attempt, the problem is the calls are always so good and so informative, to give each caller about a minute and a half so we can get to the next person.
[00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.191]  It makes for very informative and interesting radio.
[00:03:14.414 --> 00:03:19.916]  We're also going to go over all of the news headlines like US-China vow action on climate change.
[00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:24.538]  Just a foregone conclusion that it's man-made and global tax is the only answer.
[00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:31.961]  This on top of Obama bowing to the Japanese Emperor, the son of the man who attacked Pearl Harbor.
[00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:41.965]  We're going to be getting into Task Force opposes routine mammograms for women ages 40 to 49.
[00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:48.708]  What CNN doesn't tell you is that they're saying don't get mammograms because studies show it's linked to cancer.
[00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:54.592]  Another one of the reasons we see breast cancer exploding off the charts.
[00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:57.453]  One of many in that cocktail.
[00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:02.054]  So we'll break that down coming up today.
[00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:07.096]  Also, new derivatives legislation was obviously written by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
[00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:09.617]  We don't just have the Fox guarding the hen house.
[00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:13.358]  The Fox built the hen house and runs the entire system.
[00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.784]  We will also get into what's happening with the nanny state in the U.S.
[00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:21.485]  and England.
[00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:28.472]  Over in England, if you defend yourself when your house is being attacked or burglarized, they hammer you and send you to prison.
[00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:35.799]  Now, if you turn a gun into the police that you find in your backyard, you get arrested and get five years in prison.
[00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:38.742]  We'll tell you why that's going on and a lot more.
[00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.656]  I'm sure a lot of callers probably want to chime in on the guest we had on yesterday.
[00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:50.322]  Boy, people were chomping at the bit to go after that individual.
[00:04:50.322 --> 00:04:51.743]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:53.645]  Important broadcast lined up today.
[00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:57.149]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:59.952 --> 00:05:05.259]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.785]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:12.068]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:13.690]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.712]  There is a solution.
[00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:23.380]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.827]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:05:30.827 --> 00:05:36.492]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:05:36.852 --> 00:05:42.878]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:47.042]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:54.509]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.812]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:08.972]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:12.333]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:18.216]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:22.979]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.340]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.940]  Thank you.
[00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:48.154]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit oxysilver.net.
[00:06:48.154 --> 00:06:50.356]  That's O-X-Y, silver.net.
[00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:56.861]  Or call about OxySilver, ZeoLife, and GI Flora Pro, toll free at 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.043]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[00:06:59.043 --> 00:06:59.704]  Do it now.
[00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:03.107]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[00:07:03.107 --> 00:07:06.730]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.294]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[00:07:11.294 --> 00:07:12.715]  These emergency backup systems
[00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:15.817]  Provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:21.942]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:25.565]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[00:07:25.565 --> 00:07:30.388]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[00:07:30.388 --> 00:07:36.953]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:07:36.953 --> 00:07:38.895]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:42.576]  With a solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science.
[00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:47.077]  Go to MySolarBackup.com and get off the grid today.
[00:07:47.077 --> 00:07:48.857]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[00:07:48.857 --> 00:07:49.297]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:07:49.297 --> 00:07:49.597]  877-327-0365.
[00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:49.838]  Don't wait.
[00:07:49.838 --> 00:07:50.298]  Call today.
[00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:08.517]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:11.484]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.891]  It's here, ladies and gentlemen, world government.
[00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:37.172]  World government is now upon us.
[00:08:37.172 --> 00:08:41.534]  The denial is over, but for many people the denial isn't over.
[00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:50.577]  It should be over, but after decades of the controlled left and the controlled right, the Rush Limbaugh's and the Bill Clinton's,
[00:08:51.593 --> 00:09:15.006]  Laughing at people that talk about a UN takeover, making fun of people that talk about a world court, making fun of anyone that discusses carbon taxes, anyone who reads all the official Club of Rome, CFR, UN, State Department documents, anyone who reads the textbooks written by Carol Quigley for the CIA, anyone who is based in reality,
[00:09:16.235 --> 00:09:27.778]  is called a lunatic, while the establishment was stalling buying time to get their cashless society surveillance control grid in place.
[00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:31.939]  And they've now got it in place, and they've now bankrupted our economy.
[00:09:31.939 --> 00:09:41.881]  All the major mainline economists, big firms that study it, we've had our economist experts on to break down the numbers, show unemployment above 20%.
[00:09:44.206 --> 00:09:47.648]  The mainstream media says it's above 10.
[00:09:47.648 --> 00:09:59.537]  And it's only going to get worse with Obama, by design, running around saying, America can't compete, America's bad, everybody should move their businesses to China.
[00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:09.764]  With Bernanke coming out in the Associated Press and saying, oh, I'm watching the dollars decline, but I'm more worried about interest rates.
[00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:12.226]  Keeping them low will continue to drive the dollar down.
[00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:18.532]  And you notice that even though the dollar is plunging, they had said that that would boost manufacturing.
[00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:25.714]  It's actually down to record levels because this was all done by design, officially stated by the UN.
[00:10:25.714 --> 00:10:28.795]  And remember, it's not the UN taking over America.
[00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.975]  The Pentagon, the military industrial complex, 1945, needed an imperial model.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:47.363]  With a General Assembly debating society for the powerless third world, where the true power at the UN, the Security Council, run by the United States and England, and Europe, could call all the shots.
[00:10:47.363 --> 00:10:53.025]  It was an embryonic world government 60 plus years ago, it is not an embryonic world government now.
[00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:59.487]  It is on its legs, it is strong, it's got big sharp teeth, and we as a society are facing it.
[00:11:01.368 --> 00:11:09.171]  And if we could simply warn the public and illustrate the type of technocracy we're facing, we could defeat it.
[00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:17.674]  And a lot of the public is starting to finally shake themselves out of their malaise, out of the trance they're in, and look around them.
[00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:20.174]  But it's not enough, and it's not happening fast enough.
[00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:23.135]  A lot of encouraging things are developing.
[00:11:23.135 --> 00:11:25.896]  But we are definitely in deep water right now.
[00:11:25.896 --> 00:11:27.737]  We are far from getting out of these woods.
[00:11:29.377 --> 00:11:30.318]  Now here's what I'm going to do.
[00:11:30.318 --> 00:11:35.641]  I'm going to take calls to do something different this entire hour before I even start news blitzing.
[00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:42.946]  I've got a lot of audio, a lot of video clips, a lot coming up today that's important.
[00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:47.349]  But I want to go to your phone calls right now to ask you, where do you see the future going?
[00:11:47.349 --> 00:11:49.030]  How do you think we should wake people up?
[00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:58.156]  What's the best strategy through leaderless resistance to awaken the people and take over our counties and cities and states peacefully and say no to the New World Order?
[00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:09.705]  How do we wake up the military and the police to understand how they're compartmentalized and how they're being used to carry out something that's extremely wicked?
[00:12:09.705 --> 00:12:18.308]  How do we reach out to the other government bureaucrats and the private corporate leaders that, if they could see the full picture, would not go along with this?
[00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:21.870]  How do we get the public and the population to come out of denial?
[00:12:26.673 --> 00:12:29.094]  You notice they're having trouble passing cap and trade.
[00:12:29.094 --> 00:12:31.976]  You notice they're having trouble passing the global tax.
[00:12:31.976 --> 00:12:37.679]  You notice they're having trouble passing their government takeover of health care.
[00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:41.841]  We've got a fighting chance if we kick and scream and fight
[00:12:43.001 --> 00:12:45.182]  With 100% of our energy.
[00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:49.484]  And it doesn't mean you have to save the world by yourself or that you have to have all the answers.
[00:12:49.484 --> 00:12:58.788]  You've just got to get focused, you've got to get angry, you've got to get on the streets, in the county commissioners, in the city councils, in the state houses, everywhere Al Gore goes.
[00:12:59.768 --> 00:13:10.880]  Everywhere Kathleen Sebelius goes, everywhere the ghouls of this system and the spokesmen of this system go, you've got to pick an issue or two and get out there and engage these people.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.243]  Because this is for all the chips.
[00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.673]  This is the main assault the globalists have announced in the New York Times.
[00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:29.561]  They're going to try to legalize all illegal aliens and bring in unlimited third world populations to further bankrupt the social welfare system by design and bring us deeper into debt.
[00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:30.462]  That's being announced.
[00:13:31.582 --> 00:13:33.222]  Everything is in motion.
[00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:34.783]  This is the big assault.
[00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:37.343]  This is the beginning of the final battle.
[00:13:37.343 --> 00:13:43.145]  And you are on the field whether you want to consciously admit that to yourself or not.
[00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:45.626]  Because the New World Order doesn't take prisoners.
[00:13:45.626 --> 00:13:46.706]  They brainwash people.
[00:13:46.706 --> 00:13:47.606]  They take their minds.
[00:13:47.606 --> 00:13:48.626]  They take their intellects.
[00:13:48.626 --> 00:13:49.707]  They shatter them.
[00:13:49.707 --> 00:13:51.667]  They fill them full of propaganda.
[00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:59.029]  They literally poison the population with disinformation and mental sickness and illness with their different psychological warfare programs.
[00:14:00.697 --> 00:14:05.280]  They poison the public physically through the water supply, the GMO food, the chemtrail spring.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.161]  It's all real!
[00:14:07.161 --> 00:14:13.225]  And I know it's frightening to admit we're in 21st century Buck Rogers tyranny.
[00:14:13.225 --> 00:14:14.786]  I know it's hard to deal with.
[00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:18.388]  Believe me, I woke up at 2.15 last night.
[00:14:18.388 --> 00:14:21.130]  Didn't sleep.
[00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.551]  Walked outside and watched the meteor shower.
[00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:25.132]  Didn't know there was a big meteor shower.
[00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:29.275]  Went inside and googled it and found out there was a big meteor shower.
[00:14:29.631 --> 00:14:32.853]  shower that was expected to happen.
[00:14:32.853 --> 00:14:46.944]  I sat there in the cool misty dark of the night sitting on my front porch and pacing around in the darkness listening to coyotes howl in the distance.
[00:14:46.944 --> 00:14:54.710]  A big buck jumped out of the trees across the street from my house and sat there snorting in the starlight.
[00:14:55.697 --> 00:14:57.098]  The world is so beautiful.
[00:14:57.098 --> 00:14:58.440]  There's so many great things.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.621]  There's so many good things.
[00:14:59.621 --> 00:15:01.363]  There's so much innocence.
[00:15:01.363 --> 00:15:02.404]  There's so much beauty.
[00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:03.705]  There's so much honor.
[00:15:03.705 --> 00:15:05.947]  There's so much purity.
[00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:10.932]  And it's because there's all that goodness that it's a fight we have to take up against the evil.
[00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:13.495]  Because if we don't stand against it, it will take over the world.
[00:15:15.031 --> 00:15:22.796]  We can't turn over our society to these psychopathic technocrats who are carrying out all this wickedness against us.
[00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:24.096]  We've got to wake up.
[00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:25.297]  We've got to stand up.
[00:15:25.297 --> 00:15:27.358]  We've got to get involved.
[00:15:27.358 --> 00:15:29.880]  And I salute all of you that are out there fighting tyranny.
[00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.960]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls, as promised.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.440]  Let's talk to Frank in New York.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.841]  Frank, you're on the air.
[00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:39.981]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.102]  I want to commend you on The Fall of the Republic.
[00:15:43.102 --> 00:15:56.887]  It's an excellent DVD that historicizes the current status of the West beautifully in a logical and a non-aggressive fashion.
[00:15:56.887 --> 00:16:00.528]  And I wanted to say that I've been listening to your show frequently
[00:16:01.244 --> 00:16:05.007]  And I'm impressed with what you did with the mere $200,000.
[00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:09.350]  If that were done for broadcast TV, that would be a $12 million production.
[00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.270]  No doubt about it.
[00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:17.515]  So, I think that's been a tremendous benefit in raising the awareness of the people here in the States.
[00:16:17.515 --> 00:16:21.918]  But I think, Alex, we have to also look at the primary discourse.
[00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:24.760]  And what frightens me about cap-and-trade is that we have
[00:16:25.659 --> 00:16:39.803]  The young Rothschilds and the young Rockefellers demanding that this be implemented, yet their fortunes for the last 200 years have been made raping the earth with their supportive industry in the United States, in Europe, the petroleum industry, and many others.
[00:16:39.803 --> 00:16:49.485]  And they've always been able to keep their wealth in irrevocable trusts where they pay no taxes, and they're able to utilize that money to fund their own initiatives.
[00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:55.911]  And I think what we must do with this discourse, and I think it would be good to raise this when Al Gore speaks, is that...
[00:16:56.423 --> 00:17:06.888]  By him profiting over a billion dollars with the cap-and-trade legislation, he becomes a criminal raping Gaia, and therefore he should be arrested for that and confiscated.
[00:17:06.888 --> 00:17:15.753]  Yes, I mean, remember who he in 1998 cooked up the current cap-and-tax system with?
[00:17:15.753 --> 00:17:18.014]  It's on record in congressional testimony.
[00:17:18.014 --> 00:17:19.455]  Ken Lay!
[00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:20.755]  I mean, this is Ken Lay.
[00:17:20.755 --> 00:17:22.176]  This is Bernard Madoff.
[00:17:22.176 --> 00:17:23.217]  This is a joke!
[00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.038]  This is a joke!
[00:17:25.038 --> 00:17:32.144]  It's so ridiculous that we'd have these criminal con artists just laughing at us and having their way with us.
[00:17:32.144 --> 00:17:44.634]  But, you know, you mentioned the bankers in 1906 with the Sherman Antitrust Act, which they advertised they were against, which they actually wrote to make all their money and wealth tax-free.
[00:17:44.634 --> 00:17:49.018]  Now look at how Ted Turner, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, they all put their money in tax-free.
[00:17:49.018 --> 00:17:51.320]  And then they use the profit
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.302]  Tax-free to carry out eugenics.
[00:17:55.302 --> 00:17:58.304]  I mean, and it's admitted that's what they're doing.
[00:17:58.304 --> 00:18:08.010]  And it made me think of a New York Times article today where they, in plain sight, admit that both the Republican and Democratic talking points were written by
[00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:16.273]  Several lobbying firms for Big Pharma and a genetic engineering company and then it was all staged.
[00:18:16.273 --> 00:18:19.175]  But the New York Times says that's a good thing.
[00:18:19.175 --> 00:18:30.321]  I mean, they just announced openly that most TV shows are now paid for by the Pentagon and the Department of Justice with anti-gun, anti-family, pro-global warming messages.
[00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:35.044]  I mean, we are living in a absolute tyranny.
[00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:38.046]  The final vestiges of freedom are being shut down
[00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:41.742]  And they don't want to shut me down immediately.
[00:18:41.742 --> 00:18:48.326]  They just want to demonize me because that would be too much of a signal to people that this is real corruption.
[00:18:48.326 --> 00:18:57.891]  But it just makes my head spin how un-American and how Soviet that is to have most TV being written by the White House.
[00:18:57.891 --> 00:18:59.392]  It just blows my mind.
[00:18:59.392 --> 00:19:01.433]  I can't believe we're letting this happen, Frank.
[00:19:03.953 --> 00:19:07.295]  He was the communications theorist, I recognize that.
[00:19:07.295 --> 00:19:23.424]  But I wanted to also say this, that I would suggest that everyone, and people are wising up when they lose their jobs or they find out that their 401k has been looted or it's valueless, they begin to rise up very quickly and start to question.
[00:19:23.424 --> 00:19:30.508]  And I'm going to say this, I think they may have underestimated the spirit of the American, in the sense that when they lose,
[00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:34.340]  The little they have, they're going to be awfully mad.
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:53.210]  And I think, just keep track, keep a list of the names, who's doing what, who promoted this legislation, who prevented the debate on the motion to do an audit on the Federal Reserve, so that at a later date, if things do become different,
[00:19:56.548 --> 00:19:57.449]  Absolutely!
[00:19:57.449 --> 00:20:00.211]  We have to tell the truth now, just like people did with Hitler!
[00:20:10.718 --> 00:20:15.782]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:20.466]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:24.709]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:29.052]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:20:29.052 --> 00:20:33.616]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:20:33.616 --> 00:20:35.697]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:20:35.697 --> 00:20:37.679]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.740]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:45.463]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:20:45.463 --> 00:20:48.865]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.

[00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:02.473]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:02.473 --> 00:21:03.333]  Spy on me?
[00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:03.653]  Yeah.
[00:21:03.653 --> 00:21:08.697]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:08.697 --> 00:21:10.338]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.338 --> 00:21:11.078]  Startpage?

[00:22:38.004 --> 00:22:38.424]  I think so.
[00:22:59.827 --> 00:23:01.028]  The once mighty U.S.
[00:23:01.028 --> 00:23:04.049]  dollar has been replaced as the world's reserve currency.
[00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.730]  Trillions and trillions of dollars outside the U.S.
[00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.911]  will come rushing back to be redeemed into anything tangible.
[00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:14.193]  Foreigners will buy anything at any price to escape the soon worthless dollar.
[00:23:14.193 --> 00:23:18.295]  The once great dollar has been destroyed by our own reckless and irresponsible leaders.
[00:23:18.675 --> 00:23:22.297]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.
[00:23:22.297 --> 00:23:23.537]  Prepare now!
[00:23:23.537 --> 00:23:28.480]  Ready Reserve Foods is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.

[00:24:11.497 --> 00:24:11.717]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:11.717 --> 00:24:22.565]  We're here from our outpost of Liberty and Freedom, Austin, Texas.
[00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:24.527]  Deep behind occupied territory.
[00:24:24.527 --> 00:24:27.709]  Part of the world government.
[00:24:27.709 --> 00:24:31.372]  We are literal captives.
[00:24:31.372 --> 00:24:33.314]  But only captives in our minds.
[00:24:33.314 --> 00:24:35.435]  The physical grid is now going into place.
[00:24:35.435 --> 00:24:37.257]  There's still time to stop this.
[00:24:38.899 --> 00:24:41.680]  To stop this peacefully.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.601]  Jonathan in Kansas, you're on the air.
[00:24:43.601 --> 00:24:45.842]  Welcome.
[00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:47.422]  Thank you.
[00:24:47.422 --> 00:24:54.605]  NPR two weeks ago admitted that Head Start has been proven to not actually be effective.
[00:24:54.605 --> 00:25:02.589]  And they provided that Child Einstein program is actually counterproductive.
[00:25:02.589 --> 00:25:07.831]  And they found that talking to the child is more productive than television.
[00:25:08.817 --> 00:25:14.419]  Oh, but don't worry, they'll have a bigger government program to fix the last crisis they created.
[00:25:14.419 --> 00:25:37.386]  I have the Department of Education documents, we sell them in a compendium by Charlotte Isserby, the head of policy of the Department of Education, 1981 to 1985, number two position, where they stated that their goal, the book is called Deliberate Dumbing Down, it's the size of a Dallas phone book, where they admitted they wanted to turn the kids into mindless drones who didn't have any critical thinking.
[00:25:40.782 --> 00:25:41.122]  Go ahead.
[00:25:41.122 --> 00:25:42.363]  Right.
[00:25:42.363 --> 00:25:43.203]  Right.
[00:25:43.203 --> 00:25:48.665]  Also, I wanted to get into some soft kill weapons, like you mentioned.
[00:25:48.665 --> 00:25:54.868]  Hot dogs are full of sodium nitrate, which is used to induce cancer in lab rats.
[00:25:54.868 --> 00:25:57.609]  I just want to let people know that.
[00:25:57.609 --> 00:25:59.770]  But the poison sure tastes good.
[00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:04.933]  Yeah, it's got a bunch of different types of MSG in it that kill rats deader than a hammer.
[00:26:04.933 --> 00:26:06.013]  But hey, enjoy.
[00:26:06.013 --> 00:26:07.194]  Oh, also,
[00:26:11.078 --> 00:26:22.700]  My father, he's originally, he's from the third world, and there is, it's true, there is medicinal, natural stuff that does kill diseases, viruses.
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.461]  When he was younger, he was bit by a wild animal, and he had rabies.
[00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:36.443]  He took a medicinal, it was just some local medicine, some medicinal, natural stuff, and it just killed it.
[00:26:40.459 --> 00:26:51.546]  My aunts told a story when they lived in Guatemala with their young children, where one of my cousins was super, I don't want to say deathly ill, but I believe she said that.
[00:26:51.546 --> 00:26:54.268]  It's been years since I heard her tell the story.
[00:26:54.268 --> 00:27:04.654]  And the local hospital couldn't help him, but one of the local herbal ladies, you know, we call them a witch doctor, cured him.
[00:27:04.654 --> 00:27:06.495]  Go ahead.
[00:27:06.495 --> 00:27:06.715]  Yeah.
[00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.050]  That's the 400-year-old original system invented in England.
[00:27:36.027 --> 00:27:44.652]  And so that's a natural form of inoculation, and it is dangerous, but the studies show that it's a lot safer than the regular smallpox inoculation.
[00:27:44.652 --> 00:27:46.253]  But again, it's all dangerous.
[00:27:46.253 --> 00:27:49.135]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:27:49.135 --> 00:27:51.997]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:27:51.997 --> 00:27:55.059]  Let's talk to Jason in Georgia.
[00:27:55.059 --> 00:27:56.159]  Hey, Alex.
[00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:56.379]  Hey.
[00:27:56.379 --> 00:28:01.122]  A couple points on NPR the other day.
[00:28:01.122 --> 00:28:05.505]  One of their correspondents, can't remember her name, had gone and had a mammogram done
[00:28:06.132 --> 00:28:08.814]  And I'm assuming she must be one of the Washington, D.C.
[00:28:08.814 --> 00:28:15.779]  correspondents because she set off a Geiger counter going into one of the federal buildings there.
[00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:18.621]  Right after her mammogram.
[00:28:18.621 --> 00:28:20.942]  That was on CNN.
[00:28:20.942 --> 00:28:22.263]  Okay, wow.
[00:28:22.263 --> 00:28:23.424]  No, no, I'm asking you.
[00:28:23.424 --> 00:28:24.164]  I'm asking you.
[00:28:24.164 --> 00:28:25.665]  Where did you see that?
[00:28:25.665 --> 00:28:26.706]  Okay, NPR.
[00:28:26.706 --> 00:28:27.547]  Heard it on the radio.
[00:28:29.804 --> 00:28:39.450]  Well, the reason I thought of CNN is they're now announcing, oh, a panel of top doctors say don't take mammograms from age 41 to 50.
[00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:47.435]  No, it's actually 40 to 49 because doctors say you might not need to.
[00:28:47.435 --> 00:28:49.476]  But then I actually went and read the report.
[00:28:49.476 --> 00:28:51.758]  They say it may be causing cancer.
[00:28:51.758 --> 00:28:55.420]  See, why won't CNN tell people why the doctors are saying watch out?
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:56.980]  Absolutely.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:21.304]  Okay, another point, jumping around, the preacher at my church Sunday morning for Veterans Day actually had a quote in his newsletter from Woodrow Wilson talking about the setting it up for Armistice Day and all, in which, I can't remember the exact quote, but it had to do with the Council of Nations.
[00:29:21.304 --> 00:29:24.125]  You mean he was brainwashing pro-New World Order stuff?
[00:29:25.421 --> 00:29:26.061]  You know what?
[00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:32.305]  He's a brainwashed New World Order puppet and he doesn't even know it.
[00:29:32.305 --> 00:29:33.286]  Amazing, my friend.
[00:29:33.286 --> 00:29:34.526]  Great points, Jason.
[00:29:34.526 --> 00:29:35.627]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:35.627 --> 00:29:42.751]  For those that don't know, the Feds haven't just taken over almost all mainstream TV.
[00:29:42.751 --> 00:29:50.916]  They now publicly are paying tens of thousands of preachers to brainwash their flocks.
[00:29:50.916 --> 00:29:52.297]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.297 --> 00:29:53.818]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.831 --> 00:29:57.507]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:03.802]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:09.126]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:09.126 --> 00:30:11.188]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:11.188 --> 00:30:16.192]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:16.192 --> 00:30:17.373]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.373 --> 00:30:18.494]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.494 --> 00:30:20.376]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.376 --> 00:30:21.457]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.457 --> 00:30:23.659]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.659 --> 00:30:25.000]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.521]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.521 --> 00:30:27.582]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:30:27.722 --> 00:30:29.043]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:30:29.043 --> 00:30:31.764]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.764 --> 00:30:35.347]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.347 --> 00:30:39.169]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:40.410]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:41.310]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.411]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.411 --> 00:30:43.331]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:44.152]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.432 --> 00:30:47.474]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[00:30:49.256 --> 00:30:50.176]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:30:59.795 --> 00:31:05.102]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:31:05.102 --> 00:31:09.628]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:31:09.628 --> 00:31:11.911]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:31:11.911 --> 00:31:13.533]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:14.575]  There is a solution.
[00:31:14.795 --> 00:31:23.217]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[00:33:00.466 --> 00:33:02.507]  Hi, I'm Jerry from Science in New York.
[00:33:02.507 --> 00:33:09.331]  I just got through a heated debate with a fellow citizen about the war on terror because he saw me wearing a shirt which calls for a new 9-11 investigation.
[00:33:09.972 --> 00:33:18.539]  After I verbally provided him with certain facts of the 9-11 event, his response to me was that if 9-11 was an inside job, then it would be common knowledge.
[00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:23.663]  Therefore, the information that I provided to him was a farce, according to him.
[00:33:23.663 --> 00:33:30.589]  And thinking about our debate, I'm starting to get a clear picture of how this 20-slash-21st-century matrix works.
[00:33:30.589 --> 00:33:35.273]  The matrix is the ability of the electronic media to create images for the people's minds.
[00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:36.846]  Thank you for your time.
[00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:12.793]  Hey Alex, got a question as I drive into work this morning.
[00:34:12.793 --> 00:34:21.499]  Around Indianapolis and a lot of other cities, I've noticed every quarter of a mile, there are cameras with little box sensors on them.
[00:34:21.499 --> 00:34:25.942]  And I've done some investigation and they say it's for traffic monitoring.
[00:34:25.942 --> 00:34:28.925]  And I'm sure that's true, but I wonder what kind of strings are attached.
[00:34:28.925 --> 00:34:30.165]  And that's one to hear you take on.
[00:34:30.165 --> 00:34:35.369]  I've never heard you specifically address these interstate cameras that seem to be popping up everywhere.
[00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:37.251]  Thanks for your time, man.
[00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:37.511]  Bye-bye.
[00:34:46.687 --> 00:34:50.030]  Those are calls to the new listener comment line.
[00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:55.594]  We'll take the best, most focused questions and comments and rants and play them each day.
[00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:59.838]  Some days we'll play them every hour, some days we'll play them once or twice a day.
[00:34:59.838 --> 00:35:05.823]  Sometimes I may do a whole hour where we play clip after clip because I love to hear from you and the different
[00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:15.159]  Thought neuron cell synapses that fire in all our brains with the different points and angles that you bring up.
[00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:16.880]  We're going back to your calls here in just a moment.
[00:35:17.985 --> 00:35:23.850]  Great point about the control matrix on the gentleman's question about all the camera boxes going in.
[00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.151]  It's all official.
[00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:40.242]  MIT has written major articles about it and MIT Magazine bragging that the Pentagon 20 years ago, or a little more than 20 years ago now, designed what they call a control grid.
[00:35:40.242 --> 00:35:42.724]  I didn't coin that term.
[00:35:42.724 --> 00:35:43.625]  The Pentagon did.
[00:35:45.177 --> 00:35:50.701]  Of cameras that read license plates, cameras that store data everywhere you go.
[00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:54.344]  They had this at least 20 years ago of face scanning cameras.
[00:35:54.344 --> 00:36:02.870]  Now they can get your heat resonance signature when you're at the DMV or at the airport or on the street.
[00:36:03.789 --> 00:36:07.512]  Because they can't get your heat resonance without being able to match it to your name.
[00:36:07.512 --> 00:36:23.105]  So when the heat resonance cameras that are going up all over the world, this is the secret weapon that was written about a year ago by Woodworth, Bob Woodward, in his new book about Iraq.
[00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:28.810]  He said, oh, I won't tell you about the secret weapons, but it's as big as the Manhattan Project.
[00:36:29.963 --> 00:36:32.004]  And it deals with identifying people.
[00:36:32.004 --> 00:36:42.967]  But it was already in the government documents, already in the trade publications, already in the research material, 14 years ago when I really dove into all this full-time.
[00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:46.848]  And I've been warning people and warning people about the grid.
[00:36:46.848 --> 00:36:50.128]  And there's hundreds of different systems that integrate together.
[00:36:50.128 --> 00:36:55.710]  The private military industrial complex also makes huge profits while they're installing all of this.
[00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.771]  I mean, a very simple way to give you a window into this is
[00:37:00.495 --> 00:37:22.792]  More than 10 years ago I read articles about Lockheed Martin telling their stockholders that their big growth industry wouldn't just be new weapons systems and the maintenance of weapons systems but that it would be red light cameras, face scanning cameras, security systems.
[00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:27.976]  That's just one example of the control grid.
[00:37:27.976 --> 00:37:28.417]  And so
[00:37:30.347 --> 00:37:36.131]  All over the nation, they first did it in Texas, Indiana, and California.
[00:37:36.131 --> 00:37:47.839]  More than a decade ago, face-scanning cameras went in, in select test areas in downtown bar districts, in neighborhoods, in public parks.
[00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:49.380]  They tested different systems.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:58.466]  The feds have tested in Montana and Colorado, little cable systems in the middle of nowhere in the woods and mountains that have robotic trolley cameras that are
[00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:12.840]  Only about two feet long, one of the models I've seen that are wireless and then plug in at night and charge back up and then go back on these grids over hundreds of miles scanning and face scanning and tracking everyone.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.983]  I mean, these are imperial probe droids.
[00:38:15.983 --> 00:38:18.706]  Again, there's hundreds of these I could go over with you.
[00:38:18.706 --> 00:38:19.467]  It's everywhere.
[00:38:21.673 --> 00:38:33.803]  And we got another big window of this in 2003 when the governor of Wisconsin told the Green Bay newspaper, this is in my film Matrix of Evil, the news article.
[00:38:33.803 --> 00:38:36.105]  I can't remember the exact headline, I know it's in the film.
[00:38:36.105 --> 00:38:38.567]  I gave a speech and mentioned it, that's why it's in the film.
[00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:42.430]  I want you to understand, this is all on record.
[00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:50.056]  And he said, oh it's great, the feds just put in this threat integration center and
[00:38:51.505 --> 00:39:03.509]  If the police want to look for a missing person, or if the police want to know where you are, they just type in your driver's license number, your social security number, in this great facility the feds just built in Green Bay.
[00:39:03.509 --> 00:39:06.049]  And he mentioned several others for the state.
[00:39:06.049 --> 00:39:07.550]  And they type your name and ID in.
[00:39:09.474 --> 00:39:15.118]  And then it instantly on a map brings up your cell phone down to 15 feet under federal law.
[00:39:15.118 --> 00:39:16.959]  They're actually accurate to three feet.
[00:39:16.959 --> 00:39:19.381]  Triangulated with GPS off the cell towers.
[00:39:19.381 --> 00:39:28.107]  The cell towers have the GPS and they triangulate down to the cell phone that by federal law and the Telecommunications Act of 96 have tracker chips in them.
[00:39:28.107 --> 00:39:30.068]  And I would talk about this 12 years ago.
[00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:30.929]  People laugh at me.
[00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:33.411]  Now they've announced it on the news to let you know.
[00:39:33.411 --> 00:39:35.212]  But the first place I saw it announced was 2003.
[00:39:37.952 --> 00:39:41.795]  And the governor just admitted that everybody was being tracked in real time.
[00:39:41.795 --> 00:39:55.986]  And even if your cell phone's off, they can turn it on without you knowing and listen to you via the audio sensor, the audio pickup, and they can also track everywhere you are.
[00:39:55.986 --> 00:39:58.708]  So they incorporate the big brother into everything.
[00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:02.331]  Now, all they do is they have the cameras integrated in,
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.621]  To where, and they're doing this to the entire population.
[00:40:06.621 --> 00:40:12.744]  Most of the population's already been picked up, already been scanned.
[00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:18.847]  The system integrates with the software, identifies that that is you off your license plate or off your cell phone.
[00:40:18.847 --> 00:40:21.828]  It then takes a body thermal scan.
[00:40:24.554 --> 00:40:30.295]  The thermal scan is then integrated as your body's thermal biometric algorithm.
[00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:37.457]  And they say it's 99.9% accurate, and they're always telling us about stuff that's 10 to 15 years old.
[00:40:37.457 --> 00:40:40.438]  And it just expands out from there, my friends.
[00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.758]  The airport scanners.
[00:40:41.758 --> 00:40:43.919]  I remember nine years ago,
[00:40:45.129 --> 00:40:52.051]  Reading about Prada's clothing stores in a federal grant in New York and Los Angeles.
[00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:55.752]  Telling the trendies, oh we have a new fitting system.
[00:40:55.752 --> 00:41:14.177]  You step in to this chamber and it scans your body 360 and creates a perfect image of your body and then we have robotically controlled factories in China and the United States that then
[00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:20.572]  Give you the perfect tailored dress or suit.
[00:41:20.572 --> 00:41:31.755]  Now, that unit happens to be developed by the same group of companies that have in 200 plus airports in the U.S.
[00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:33.316]  now, the body scanners.
[00:41:33.316 --> 00:41:40.357]  You know, shows the naked image of people on the news when they show it to you and throw it in your face, part of your indoctrination to accept this.
[00:41:40.357 --> 00:41:42.138]  So when your family steps into those,
[00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:48.190]  And of course, most of the foolish TSA people don't even know this.
[00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.850]  It's all being recorded on hard drive.
[00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.391]  It's all being databased.
[00:41:51.391 --> 00:41:54.532]  And then now they don't just have your heat resonance.
[00:41:54.532 --> 00:41:56.813]  That's done with the cameras.
[00:41:56.813 --> 00:42:02.615]  Now they have your biometric body scan, where even if you wear a mask,
[00:42:03.914 --> 00:42:13.738]  Now, with these passive MRIs that they're putting into the airports and train stations going nationwide, they can scan right through your clothes and ID you off that.
[00:42:13.738 --> 00:42:26.943]  Of course, you know about the biometrics that deal with your walk, your certain walk.
[00:42:26.943 --> 00:42:28.524]  It's incredible.
[00:42:28.524 --> 00:42:29.564]  That's the secret weapon.
[00:42:31.383 --> 00:42:40.494]  So yes, sir, they're putting in independent power boxes and solar panel power boxes with wireless cameras and cabled cameras.
[00:42:40.494 --> 00:42:41.635]  No expenses spared.
[00:42:41.635 --> 00:42:49.124]  We confirmed that many areas of the country have kill cables that can broadcast a frequency under federal law.
[00:42:49.124 --> 00:42:49.684]  All cars.
[00:42:50.928 --> 00:42:53.610]  And it's the same law in all the industrialized nations.
[00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:55.791]  When your car drives over it, it kills your car.
[00:42:55.791 --> 00:43:02.716]  Police helicopters are now being fitted in the biggest cities with a broadcast system that they aim at your car and it kills it.
[00:43:02.716 --> 00:43:11.681]  A total grid is now in place.
[00:43:11.681 --> 00:43:18.385]  A total and complete grid.
[00:43:18.385 --> 00:43:19.046]  They go further.
[00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:25.291]  I would talk about this 14 years ago because I'd seen federal documents that listeners sent me.
[00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:26.011]  I've had U.S.
[00:43:26.011 --> 00:43:26.951]  representatives on.
[00:43:26.951 --> 00:43:32.273]  I've had representatives, national representatives of Australia on, British representatives on.
[00:43:32.273 --> 00:43:34.593]  Just so if you'd hear it from them, maybe you'd believe it.
[00:43:34.593 --> 00:43:36.934]  Now I don't have to have them on.
[00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:39.954]  Oh no!
[00:43:39.954 --> 00:43:44.395]  About eight months ago, I was still doing the Sunday show out of NewsRadio 590K LBJ.
[00:43:44.395 --> 00:43:46.876]  They still carry the show, but I was doing the Sunday show out of their studios.
[00:43:48.246 --> 00:43:50.507]  Syndicating and out of their studios.
[00:43:50.507 --> 00:43:57.469]  And I heard Sarah Hudeberg, great local news writer and broadcaster, do the Sunday News.
[00:43:57.469 --> 00:44:11.054]  And she said, everyone at birth in Texas has their blood taken and it's done nationwide and it's stored by the University of Texas at San Antonio and it's used in research for the Human Genome Project and for a DNA database.
[00:44:11.054 --> 00:44:12.294]  And I came running out
[00:44:13.916 --> 00:44:16.737]  We were about to go live in 30 seconds, and I said, who told you that?
[00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:17.578]  How do you know that?
[00:44:17.578 --> 00:44:19.239]  She said, oh, here's the statesman.
[00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:23.521]  Handed me the paper, front page, Metro and State, announcing it to everyone.
[00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:36.667]  For 36 plus years, everyone in the Western world, in a concerted, standardized, we've been under world government for a long time, have had your blood taken at birth.
[00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:40.969]  And Dick Cheney says it's for race-specific bioweapons and that they need to be used.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:54.024]  And I just can't believe this is happening.
[00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:55.805]  I can't believe we're letting this happen.
[00:44:55.805 --> 00:44:58.726]  I mean, these people mean business!
[00:44:58.726 --> 00:44:59.186]  So, there.
[00:44:59.186 --> 00:45:01.407]  I said I'm going to take a lot of calls, but I played that clip.
[00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:02.668]  I wanted to answer you, sir.
[00:45:03.973 --> 00:45:11.276]  They rolled it out in the last 12 years or so to the public as, oh, you can go online or the local TV stations can get feeds of traffic.
[00:45:11.276 --> 00:45:12.597]  Isn't it great?
[00:45:12.597 --> 00:45:16.238]  Those are the big stationary wide shot cameras.
[00:45:16.238 --> 00:45:19.880]  I talked to John Hurt, TxDOT official, over a decade ago and he laughed.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.641]  I said, aren't there a lot of other cameras we don't see?
[00:45:21.641 --> 00:45:23.081]  And he said, yes, Alex.
[00:45:23.081 --> 00:45:25.963]  For every one camera you see, there's nine cameras you don't.
[00:45:25.963 --> 00:45:26.683]  That was in 1998.
[00:45:26.683 --> 00:45:27.323]  So I guess 11 years ago.
[00:45:31.789 --> 00:45:33.270]  And I've known this information.
[00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.672]  I sit here reading government documents constantly.
[00:45:35.672 --> 00:45:36.772]  Totally freaking me out.
[00:45:36.772 --> 00:45:37.653]  I love my family.
[00:45:37.653 --> 00:45:39.514]  I love everybody.
[00:45:39.514 --> 00:45:40.715]  It's horrible.
[00:45:40.715 --> 00:45:42.316]  It's horrible.
[00:45:42.316 --> 00:45:43.957]  They're putting poison in our water.
[00:45:43.957 --> 00:45:48.000]  They admit they're doing that on purpose to brain damage us and give us cancer.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:46:01.469]  I remember when I first got on air being sent government documents and research documents about how they knew that the high-powered radiation with mammograms, the way that it was tuned, was giving women breast cancer.
[00:46:02.915 --> 00:46:04.456]  And now it's mainstream news.
[00:46:04.456 --> 00:46:05.476]  They know!
[00:46:05.476 --> 00:46:06.097]  They know!
[00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.757]  They're killing all of us!
[00:46:07.757 --> 00:46:09.158]  You foolish government agents!
[00:46:09.158 --> 00:46:10.219]  You foolish cops!
[00:46:10.219 --> 00:46:11.119]  FBI people!
[00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:12.220]  Do you like your kids dying?
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.241]  Do you like your mama dying?
[00:46:14.241 --> 00:46:15.081]  You like dying?
[00:46:15.081 --> 00:46:17.782]  I mean, this isn't a game, boys!
[00:46:17.782 --> 00:46:20.004]  You think I'm up here risking my life?
[00:46:20.004 --> 00:46:22.565]  Putting it all on the line for some ego trip?
[00:46:22.565 --> 00:46:25.286]  No, I'm telling the truth.
[00:46:25.286 --> 00:46:30.089]  And I wish this wasn't true every day.
[00:46:30.089 --> 00:46:30.869]  But it is true.
[00:46:32.483 --> 00:46:34.705]  I'm going to go over that mammogram information later.
[00:46:34.705 --> 00:46:36.006]  Let's go to Don in Wisconsin.
[00:46:36.006 --> 00:46:38.708]  Don, you're on the air.
[00:46:38.708 --> 00:46:39.669]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[00:46:39.669 --> 00:46:46.014]  I want to talk about conditioning and brainwashing in movies for a little bit.
[00:46:46.014 --> 00:46:48.196]  Specifically, like Stanley Kubrick.
[00:46:48.196 --> 00:46:49.236]  I wanted to get your opinion.
[00:46:50.609 --> 00:46:55.454]  Whether he was an insider or he was trying to expose the system.
[00:47:05.433 --> 00:47:06.234]  Eight minutes?
[00:47:06.234 --> 00:47:10.277]  It was 28 minutes, if memory serves, and it was over 20.
[00:47:10.277 --> 00:47:11.478]  It was 28.
[00:47:11.478 --> 00:47:12.718]  But check it for yourself.
[00:47:12.718 --> 00:47:14.200]  It was in Variety.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:19.343]  I covered it at the time he died, two days after he died, on local radio, before I was even syndicated.
[00:47:19.343 --> 00:47:20.464]  Well, I just started getting syndicated.
[00:47:20.464 --> 00:47:25.628]  The point is, I have to go back to memory, so it's a memory path, so I'll get a lot of useless info when I access those memory areas.
[00:47:25.628 --> 00:47:28.330]  But the issue is, Kubrick
[00:47:30.157 --> 00:47:33.879]  So this movie is going to show you what's really going on.
[00:47:33.879 --> 00:47:37.681]  He had final cut and yet an ironclad contract.
[00:47:37.681 --> 00:47:42.364]  He had final cut on the film where he couldn't be controlled and he refused to cut it.
[00:47:43.345 --> 00:47:50.648]  Then the distributor threatened to not distribute it, and then he died mysteriously, and they cut the 20-plus minutes.
[00:47:50.648 --> 00:47:56.990]  So, yes, Kubrick, total high-level insider, total illuminist.
[00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.751]  Same thing with Arthur C. Clarke.
[00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:07.034]  I mean, you don't get any more high-powered than these people, and I believe they killed him better than a hammer.
[00:48:07.034 --> 00:48:08.675]  He was more like Huxley than
[00:48:10.992 --> 00:48:13.074]  Uh... Orwell then.
[00:48:13.074 --> 00:48:25.463]  Like, say, in Full Metal Jacket, when he's got Jack T. Ripper talking about fluoride, is that to belittle it and make people think that's ridiculous to talk about fluoride?
[00:48:25.463 --> 00:48:27.965]  That's Dr. Strangelove.
[00:48:27.965 --> 00:48:30.527]  Yeah, Dr. Strangelove, yeah.
[00:48:30.527 --> 00:48:34.150]  Yes, that's exactly what it is.
[00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:37.072]  Yeah, well... I mean, last year I had the head
[00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:55.646]  Of the EPA union on a top doctor in toxicology, over 90% of their scientists signed a letter saying, take what is known as sodium fluoride out of the water, that it's a catch-all term for hundreds of toxic chemicals.
[00:48:55.646 --> 00:48:57.607]  I mean, 90% of the scientists don't want it.
[00:48:57.607 --> 00:48:58.848]  They're saying, what are you doing?
[00:48:58.848 --> 00:48:59.789]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:03.012]  Oh, there's a movie making fun of it, just like Woody Harrelson.
[00:49:03.012 --> 00:49:04.233]  I'm not saying he's a bad guy.
[00:49:04.233 --> 00:49:05.354]  I know him well.
[00:49:06.226 --> 00:49:07.968]  He's into fighting the New World Order.
[00:49:07.968 --> 00:49:11.090]  I'm sure he's not sophisticated enough to understand what happened to him.
[00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:19.538]  They made him, had him make all these fake YouTube videos where he talks about the seed bank and acts all crazy and says the globalists have a UN seed bank.
[00:49:19.538 --> 00:49:21.380]  That's in Associated Press Reuters.
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:25.984]  But now when you talk about it, they'll go, oh, that's wacky Woody Harrelson.
[00:49:25.984 --> 00:49:27.785]  So see, that's what they do with this.
[00:49:27.785 --> 00:49:30.428]  And I watched one night hours of these.
[00:49:30.428 --> 00:49:31.949]  He's made dozens and dozens of these.
[00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.753]  Five and ten minute and six and seven minute videos.
[00:49:35.753 --> 00:49:37.494]  Just go to the 2012 website on YouTube.
[00:49:37.494 --> 00:49:38.455]  In fact, we'll play some today.
[00:49:38.455 --> 00:49:39.676]  I've been meaning to do that.
[00:49:39.676 --> 00:49:40.517]  I want to talk about 2012.
[00:49:40.517 --> 00:49:42.859]  That's in my... I haven't seen it yet, but I've read the script.
[00:49:42.859 --> 00:49:47.764]  I was sent the script secretly by people involved with it.
[00:49:47.764 --> 00:49:51.388]  But the point is, I knew about it six months ago.
[00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:56.673]  The issue here is that that's how they have revelation of the method.
[00:49:57.352 --> 00:50:08.096]  That's why the CIA approached Chris Carter of the X-Files Loan Gunman and said, we want you to make an episode about hijacked jet flown to the World Trade Center as a pretext to attack Afghanistan.
[00:50:08.096 --> 00:50:11.557]  The government would use a drill to make the rest of NORAD stand down.
[00:50:11.557 --> 00:50:19.020]  I mean, I had this from Dean Haglund, the main star of the Loan Gunman X-Files spinoff, interviewed him.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:25.963]  The CIA came to them and planted these stories, and then now people say, oh, you just got that from the X-Files.
[00:50:27.489 --> 00:50:27.970]  Right.
[00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:35.959]  Well, I heard you one time say that the director, that Mexican director of Children of Men was, you know, he was not part of that.
[00:50:35.959 --> 00:50:40.845]  That movie, he was trying to wake people up or something.
[00:50:40.845 --> 00:50:45.130]  Yes, I know several producers and directors that know him and they say that's the case.
[00:50:46.738 --> 00:50:49.022]  What's the difference?
[00:50:49.022 --> 00:50:53.069]  It seems like it's predictive programming.
[00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.810]  I agree with you.
[00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.593]  You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't.
[00:50:55.593 --> 00:50:57.657]  What does it do when I get up here and talk about all this?
[00:50:57.657 --> 00:50:59.240]  At a certain level it acclimates people.
[00:51:00.592 --> 00:51:09.756]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[00:51:09.756 --> 00:51:13.117]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[00:51:13.117 --> 00:51:19.000]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.762]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[00:51:23.762 --> 00:51:26.123]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[00:51:26.403 --> 00:51:26.763]  I'm good.
[00:51:45.219 --> 00:51:48.942]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:51.144]  That's O-X-Y, Silver.net.

[00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:58.110]  Do it now.
[00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:04.074]  What's so crazy about not starving?
[00:52:04.074 --> 00:52:10.963]  To cover yourself and your family in the event of accidents or emergency, you may have home, life, auto, dental and health insurance.
[00:52:10.963 --> 00:52:12.665]  But what about food insurance?
[00:52:12.665 --> 00:52:14.948]  Water and food are vital to human survival.
[00:52:14.948 --> 00:52:17.451]  So what's so crazy about not starving?
[00:52:17.631 --> 00:52:23.994]  Foodinsurance.com has designed emergency packs and kits with at least two weeks worth of great-tasting food and clean water.

[00:52:46.684 --> 00:52:47.045]  We're good.
[00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:02.596]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[00:53:02.596 --> 00:53:04.117]  Say no to toxic overload.
[00:53:04.117 --> 00:53:05.439]  Say no to chemicals.
[00:53:05.439 --> 00:53:07.401]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:16.189]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[00:53:16.189 --> 00:53:21.614]  Chemical-free liquid zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[00:53:21.614 --> 00:53:23.216]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[00:53:23.396 --> 00:53:30.879]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.

[00:53:51.949 --> 00:53:52.829]  Boy, these are great calls.
[00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:53.730]  I can't wait to take more.
[00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:54.230]  Renee, Mark, Holly, Terry.
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:19.102]  I haven't even gotten into the giant stack of news yet.
[00:54:19.102 --> 00:54:23.585]  We do have Webster Tarpley popping in in the last hour because he wrote an amazing analysis.
[00:54:23.585 --> 00:54:27.847]  You know, he's a doctorate in history and a doctorate in economics.
[00:54:27.847 --> 00:54:33.371]  He understands false flag events and the way these synthetic events are crafted like no other.
[00:54:34.298 --> 00:54:39.781]  He has done an analysis and believes the evidence points directly at a stage event at Fort Hood.
[00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:46.986]  We've kind of held our tongue on this while we analyze the situation and Dr. Tarpley concurs with my analysis.
[00:54:46.986 --> 00:54:48.227]  It looks bad.
[00:54:48.227 --> 00:54:50.248]  Tarpley is on in the last hour.
[00:54:50.248 --> 00:54:50.508]  Correct?
[00:54:50.508 --> 00:54:51.309]  We did get him, right?
[00:54:52.176 --> 00:54:55.078]  I'm going to have him on for 30 minutes, but wide open phones.
[00:54:55.078 --> 00:55:02.243]  For this segment and a little bit of the next though, once a month I like to have special sponsors on that are part of the solution.
[00:55:02.243 --> 00:55:05.806]  So I wanted to bring Marty Schachter, World War II vet in the Chemical Corps.
[00:55:05.806 --> 00:55:08.908]  I think that's always interesting.
[00:55:08.908 --> 00:55:15.212]  I'm going to do a project interviewing World War II vets because it's a breed that's fading quickly, but not Marty.
[00:55:15.212 --> 00:55:15.933]  Family owned.
[00:55:16.963 --> 00:55:22.405]  High-quality organic soap company that never sold directly to the public.
[00:55:22.405 --> 00:55:24.286]  They sold to institutions.
[00:55:24.286 --> 00:55:26.007]  You pay less and get higher quality.
[00:55:26.007 --> 00:55:27.787]  They're California Organic Certified.
[00:55:27.787 --> 00:55:29.488]  They got a whole line of products.
[00:55:29.488 --> 00:55:32.549]  You save 85% off supermarket prices.
[00:55:32.549 --> 00:55:38.312]  And he got out of the chemical corps and noticed that the new detergents they called soap were chemical weapons.
[00:55:38.312 --> 00:55:39.632]  So him and his dad got together.
[00:55:39.632 --> 00:55:40.652]  He now runs it with his son.
[00:55:40.652 --> 00:55:43.073]  I mean, do the math.
[00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:43.374]  47 to now.
[00:55:46.107 --> 00:55:47.268]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:55:47.268 --> 00:55:48.489]  Pleasure talking to you.
[00:55:48.489 --> 00:55:49.050]  Got good news!
[00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:50.231]  Good news from Procter & Gamble!
[00:56:07.648 --> 00:56:26.620]  They're going up, the first of the month, 25% of their prices, and they're going to also offer the consumer generic products that are outsourced, that have a single box color, that have cheaper perfumes and cheaper ingredients to counter that.
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.722]  You're being ripped off, consumer!
[00:56:28.722 --> 00:56:36.367]  You're being ripped off by the multi-billion dollar chemical manufacturer with fancy names like biodegradable,
[00:56:37.257 --> 00:56:41.838]  Yeah, they have the Chinese versions that they own, that's the discount brand.
[00:56:41.838 --> 00:56:51.521]  In England they have this scam where the majority of the retail sales of food are by one company but they have two different branches so people don't know.
[00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:55.482]  And they have fake sales against each other.
[00:56:55.482 --> 00:56:56.862]  Right, that's what they're doing.
[00:56:56.862 --> 00:57:03.204]  They just keep ripping off the consumer with terminologies like anti-bacterials!
[00:57:03.993 --> 00:57:15.987]  You know, but still giving you deteriorated clothing, burning, itching skin, burning, itching eyes, burning, itching hair, while emptying your wallet or purse.
[00:57:15.987 --> 00:57:23.776]  They grossed last year, people don't know the amount of business they do, they grossed 65 billion dollars worth of business.
[00:57:24.437 --> 00:57:29.019]  And they did it with petrochemical distillates that would just be toxic waste.
[00:57:29.019 --> 00:57:31.440]  Instead, they put it in your products.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.021]  Exactly!
[00:57:33.021 --> 00:57:36.782]  I keep saying, consumer, you're being ripped off!
[00:57:36.782 --> 00:57:38.903]  You've got to do something about it.
[00:57:38.903 --> 00:57:39.944]  You're being brainwashed.
[00:57:39.944 --> 00:57:41.624]  You're being hypnotized.
[00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:46.106]  They spent six and a half billion dollars on TV advertisement.
[00:57:46.106 --> 00:57:47.727]  We've got to put a stop to that.
[00:57:48.385 --> 00:57:49.446]  That's right.
[00:57:49.446 --> 00:57:53.091]  Just call me and we can put a stop to that right now.
[00:57:53.091 --> 00:57:56.154]  You've got a tote bag sampler of an index of your products.
[00:57:56.154 --> 00:57:57.836]  It's very inexpensive.
[00:57:57.836 --> 00:57:59.658]  Delivered to your door.
[00:57:59.658 --> 00:58:01.781]  You've got year supplies, month supplies.
[00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:03.923]  Folks, go to 5starsoap.com.
[00:58:03.923 --> 00:58:04.564]  That's the number.

[00:58:12.095 --> 00:58:17.677]  We've got banners up at Infowars.com and JonesReport.com to FiveStarsoap.com or give them a call 800-340-7091.
[00:58:17.677 --> 00:58:17.738]  800-340-7091.
[00:58:17.738 --> 00:58:18.698]  Don't wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:18.698 --> 00:58:21.899]  Just like I told you, buy gold when it was $280 an ounce and now it's $1,140.
[00:58:32.344 --> 00:58:35.707]  I'm telling you, get high quality organic soap and save 85%.
[00:58:35.707 --> 00:58:37.889]  I feel good pushing these products.
[00:58:37.889 --> 00:58:38.850]  5starsoap.com.
[00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:42.753]  Stay there, Marty.
[00:58:42.753 --> 00:58:45.256]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.256 --> 00:58:47.558]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.831 --> 00:58:55.373]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:58:55.373 --> 00:58:56.294]  Number one.
[00:58:56.294 --> 00:58:59.715]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.715 --> 00:59:00.576]  Number two.
[00:59:00.576 --> 00:59:05.478]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:05.478 --> 00:59:06.219]  It's true.
[00:59:06.219 --> 00:59:10.761]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:11.902]  Number 3.
[00:59:11.902 --> 00:59:15.485]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:19.409]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:19.409 --> 00:59:20.209]  Number 4.
[00:59:20.209 --> 00:59:22.972]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.972 --> 00:59:26.655]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.655 --> 00:59:27.436]  Number 5.
[00:59:27.436 --> 00:59:31.580]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:36.344]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.624 --> 00:59:40.787]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.787 --> 00:59:42.588]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.588 --> 00:59:44.849]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.849 --> 00:59:47.451]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:55.736]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.736 --> 01:00:05.102]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:05.682]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.388 --> 01:00:08.151]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:09.914]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.914 --> 01:00:11.496]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.496 --> 01:00:12.418]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.418 --> 01:00:17.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.245 --> 01:00:21.311]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.357 --> 01:00:27.801]  In the next segment, we are going directly back to your calls, open phones.
[01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:31.084]  It was extremely informative, frankly quite riveting last hour.
[01:00:31.084 --> 01:00:36.368]  We're finishing up right now with Marty Schachter of Calvin Pure Soap, 5starsoap.com.
[01:00:36.368 --> 01:00:41.313]  Marty, in the few minutes we've got left, tell folks about your product line and give me a limerick.
[01:00:41.869 --> 01:00:47.951]  Well, one, we have a sampler package for $20 last year, about a month or two.
[01:00:47.951 --> 01:00:49.612]  It's £6.
[01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:53.253]  It's got all our beautiful Pure Soap products.
[01:00:53.253 --> 01:01:01.956]  We've got bulk packages from one year to five years, save you over $1,000 a year from retail prices in any marketplace.
[01:01:02.416 --> 01:01:03.276]  We've got it.
[01:01:03.276 --> 01:01:04.636]  We guarantee it.
[01:01:04.636 --> 01:01:09.097]  Unconditional guarantee on the product to your satisfaction.
[01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:12.838]  Satisfaction guarantee or double your dirt bag.
[01:01:12.838 --> 01:01:13.758]  We've got it.
[01:01:13.758 --> 01:01:14.838]  We share it.
[01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.679]  You can call our family.
[01:01:17.679 --> 01:01:19.499]  Myself, my son, my daughter.
[01:01:19.499 --> 01:01:21.679]  We're all here waiting for you to call 1-800-340-7091.
[01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:23.440]  We're here for you.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.240]  I got a very old story I found in my files.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.881]  Are you ready?
[01:01:32.881 --> 01:01:34.282]  I am.
[01:01:34.282 --> 01:01:38.846]  He took me up into his room, where we could not be seen.
[01:01:38.846 --> 01:01:43.530]  He put his hand around my neck, so tight I could not scream.
[01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:47.493]  He took off all my wrappings and gazed upon my form.
[01:01:47.493 --> 01:01:52.056]  I stood there, cold and shivering, while he was steaming warm.
[01:01:52.056 --> 01:01:59.743]  Again, he touched me with his fiery lips, without pause, stint, or fear, and made me what I am today.
[01:02:00.575 --> 01:02:01.857]  An empty bottle of beer.
[01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:18.139]  A decade ago, you couldn't find organic food hardly anywhere.
[01:02:18.139 --> 01:02:28.990]  People started demanding it, now it's displacing all the crud, and so the feds are coming in wanting to label non-organic food, unsafe food, GMO food as organic.
[01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.710]  It's the same thing.
[01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:37.798]  If you start buying high-quality organic soap products, and for hair, you name it, lotions, they've got it all, bar soap.
[01:02:38.877 --> 01:02:48.803]  If you, uh, dishwashing soap, laundry soap, real soap, if you start doing that, and then it's starting to happen, we can displace these giants.
[01:02:48.803 --> 01:02:50.864]  800-340-7091.
[01:02:50.864 --> 01:02:52.085]  Marty, great having you with us.
[01:02:52.085 --> 01:02:52.465]  Thank you.
[01:02:52.465 --> 01:02:53.465]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:02:53.465 --> 01:02:54.546]  Talk to you soon.
[01:02:54.546 --> 01:02:55.286]  You bet, my friend.
[01:02:55.286 --> 01:02:56.507]  Bye-bye.
[01:02:56.507 --> 01:03:02.711]  Okay, we're gonna go to break, and again, I have this giant stack of vital news in front of me we're gonna be going over as well.
[01:03:04.232 --> 01:03:12.654]  One of the big ones is a health issue and I mentioned it last hour but I want to cover it more after we get to a couple of galleries of calls here.
[01:03:12.654 --> 01:03:17.915]  CNN, task force opposes routine mammograms for women age 40 to 49.
[01:03:17.915 --> 01:03:27.077]  Now I study this so in depth and my level of knowledge and I'm not someone who's wise will tell you how much they don't know.
[01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:30.872]  It's just that it's like a brain boost or something.
[01:03:30.872 --> 01:03:35.514]  Knowing our enemy so well, it's pure torture at certain times.
[01:03:35.514 --> 01:03:40.497]  Believe me, the novelty of knowing what's really going on kind of wears off when you can't turn it off.
[01:03:40.497 --> 01:03:41.798]  You can't not understand.
[01:03:41.798 --> 01:03:44.479]  It's about 2.30 in the morning.
[01:03:44.479 --> 01:03:45.660]  Wake up, can't go to sleep.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.560]  I'm in front of the computer.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.744]  Headline, task force opposes routine mammograms for women age 40-49.
[01:03:52.744 --> 01:03:56.546]  Now, I knew before I read it that they were never going to tell you
[01:03:58.737 --> 01:04:03.301]  That the task force opposes it because it can cause cancer.
[01:04:03.301 --> 01:04:05.503]  The studies show.
[01:04:05.503 --> 01:04:10.768]  I already knew that a bunch of other major groups and universities and task forces had come out years ago.
[01:04:10.768 --> 01:04:11.929]  Years ago!
[01:04:11.929 --> 01:04:13.690]  More than a decade ago.
[01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:16.153]  And I knew when I read this article it wouldn't be in there.
[01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:19.976]  I knew they would just say, oh, but that's how the globalists operate.
[01:04:19.976 --> 01:04:21.017]  They lie by omission.
[01:04:21.017 --> 01:04:22.899]  That's their favorite.
[01:04:22.899 --> 01:04:24.580]  Oh yeah, you might not need those.
[01:04:26.092 --> 01:04:31.137]  But some other doctors disagree and say the risk of cancer is great enough that you might want to do it.
[01:04:31.137 --> 01:04:36.142]  But they don't tell you why they're saying don't do it, that it can give you cancer.
[01:04:36.142 --> 01:04:37.123]  That it can trigger cancer.
[01:04:38.735 --> 01:04:50.501]  So I just googled the term mammograms cancer and hundreds of mainstream articles like this one, mammograms can increase breast cancer risk, the Daily Mail, from June 27, 2006.
[01:04:50.501 --> 01:04:54.703]  When I say hundreds, there's actually thousands.
[01:04:54.703 --> 01:04:55.903]  I'm just being conservative.
[01:04:55.903 --> 01:04:59.125]  See, CNN won't even tell women the truth.
[01:05:01.237 --> 01:05:06.821]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to invite you to go to TPR20info.com.

[01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:34.970]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.731]  You need to look out for yourself.
[01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:39.251]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[01:06:39.251 --> 01:06:43.972]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[01:06:43.972 --> 01:06:47.693]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today.
[01:06:47.693 --> 01:06:50.814]  Again, it is here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:50.814 --> 01:06:52.714]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:06:52.714 --> 01:06:54.815]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[01:07:00.979 --> 01:07:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.221]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.221 --> 01:07:13.022]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.022 --> 01:07:19.424]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.424 --> 01:07:21.665]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:22.505]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:23.005]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:23.806]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:24.966]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.966 --> 01:07:27.207]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.112 --> 01:07:43.233]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:48.374]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:48.374 --> 01:08:01.078]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:06.640]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.203 --> 01:08:22.725]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:23.506]  to 3 p.m.
[01:08:23.506 --> 01:08:24.006]  Central.
[01:08:24.006 --> 01:08:25.147]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:08:25.147 --> 01:08:25.848]  Eastern.
[01:08:25.848 --> 01:08:26.729]  We're here live.
[01:08:26.729 --> 01:08:39.459]  Webster Griffin Tarverly, economist, historian, top terror analyst, has done a detailed breakdown report that he gave to Infowars.com to post yesterday.
[01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:49.915]  And he's going to be joining us in the last hour to go over the evidence that Fort Hood was a staged event, a drill that they used as a cover story.
[01:08:49.915 --> 01:08:57.460]  Just like they had a drill on April 19, 1995 to cover their operation, their false flag bombing.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:04.285]  The government had drills running of the exact same targets being attacked at the exact same time on 9-11 to make NORAD get confused and stand down.
[01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:17.770]  7-7, the government contracted for a drill to be run that morning of the exact same bus and exact same trains to be attacked at the exact same stations at the exact same time.
[01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:27.236]  In my film Terror Storm, there's an actuary that was done, the system they use for insurance calculations, that it was, what, 1 out of 23 Trectogillian?
[01:09:27.236 --> 01:09:30.898]  That's trillions of times all the grains of sand in all the world.
[01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:35.052]  And by the way, I'm not going to play the clips.
[01:09:35.052 --> 01:09:47.925]  You can Google Peter Power Drill on YouTube, and you can see him on BBC, on ITN, and on BBC Radio, and then on CBC.
[01:09:50.339 --> 01:09:56.125]  He gave four different interviews, in case people think he spoke incorrectly, going, Oh, it was quite incredible.
[01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.186]  It was quite strange.
[01:09:57.186 --> 01:09:58.387]  It was quite amazing.
[01:09:58.387 --> 01:09:59.969]  In fact, people won't believe it.
[01:09:59.969 --> 01:10:00.970]  It's been years since I played it.
[01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:02.732]  Go to YouTube and type in Peter Power.
[01:10:04.141 --> 01:10:07.082]  Peter Power drills on 7-7.
[01:10:07.082 --> 01:10:08.543]  Admits drills on 7-7.
[01:10:08.543 --> 01:10:10.784]  Peter Power admits drills on 7-7.
[01:10:10.784 --> 01:10:14.686]  And there'll be BBC, ITN, CBC, and BBC Radio.
[01:10:14.686 --> 01:10:15.887]  Just pick one of them.
[01:10:15.887 --> 01:10:16.967]  He says the same thing.
[01:10:16.967 --> 01:10:19.428]  Because they were meant to throw it in everybody's face.
[01:10:19.428 --> 01:10:22.630]  Plus, I don't believe he was involved in the attacks, and I've been clear about that.
[01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:29.453]  But when media's gone to talk to him about it after this, at one speaking event he went and locked himself in a broom closet and hid for an hour and wouldn't come out.
[01:10:31.732 --> 01:10:41.577]  Well, in that case, he was at a public forum at the London School of Economics.
[01:10:41.577 --> 01:10:42.678]  He won't talk about it.
[01:10:42.678 --> 01:10:46.459]  But obviously, I don't think he was involved because he came right out.
[01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:49.301]  He was the former head of Scotland Yard, head spokesperson.
[01:10:49.301 --> 01:10:54.704]  He came out and said, oh, it was quite eerie, quite strange.
[01:10:54.704 --> 01:10:57.225]  We were running the exact same drills at the exact same time.
[01:10:58.578 --> 01:11:02.219]  And then it turned out they were with the Metro, with the Underground.
[01:11:02.219 --> 01:11:03.540]  Now, why would they do that?
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:12.163]  Here he is from ITN, National British Television.
[01:11:12.163 --> 01:11:14.564]  Here it is.
[01:11:14.564 --> 01:11:23.927]  Today we were running an exercise for a company, bearing in mind I'm now in the private sector, and we sat everybody down in the city, a thousand people involved in the whole organization, but the crisis team
[01:11:24.767 --> 01:11:30.612]  And the most peculiar thing was, we based our scenario on a simultaneous attack from an underground and mainline station.
[01:11:30.612 --> 01:11:34.875]  So we had to suddenly switch an exercise from fictional to real.
[01:11:34.875 --> 01:11:37.677]  And one of the first things is, get that bureau number.
[01:11:37.677 --> 01:11:39.659]  When you have a list of people missing, tell them.
[01:11:40.439 --> 01:11:41.880]  And it took a long time.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:49.003]  Just to get this right, you are actually working today on an exercise that envisioned virtually this scenario?
[01:11:49.003 --> 01:11:49.844]  Almost precisely.
[01:11:49.844 --> 01:11:57.167]  I was up until 2 o'clock this morning because it's our job, my own company, Weiser Consultants, we specialize in helping people to get their crisis management response.
[01:11:57.167 --> 01:12:00.209]  How do you jump from slow time thinking to quick time doing?
[01:12:00.209 --> 01:12:02.490]  And we chose a scenario with their assistance.
[01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:08.334]  Which is based on a terrorist attack because they're very close to a property occupied by Jewish businessmen.
[01:12:08.334 --> 01:12:12.917]  They're in the city and there are more American banks in the city than there are in the whole of New York.
[01:12:12.917 --> 01:12:15.680]  Now, there are several reasons the globalists do this.
[01:12:16.468 --> 01:12:20.189]  They fund terror attacks through the drill funding.
[01:12:20.189 --> 01:12:26.172]  That way if another agency that's compartmentalized and not involved in the attacks finds out about it.
[01:12:26.172 --> 01:12:27.972]  If they catch the men planting bombs.
[01:12:27.972 --> 01:12:39.617]  If the police would have stopped the four young Arab men who we know were hired to take part in another drill to test security.
[01:12:39.617 --> 01:12:44.539]  If anyone busts them or catches them, oh, it's just a drill.
[01:12:44.539 --> 01:12:45.079]  You understand?
[01:12:47.927 --> 01:13:00.095]  And also with InfoPoll 9, Echelon, the different snooping systems, when different bureaus pick up on the chatter of a terror attack, they stand down because they're told it's just a drill.
[01:13:00.095 --> 01:13:02.097]  So I could go on and on on these subjects.
[01:13:02.097 --> 01:13:04.979]  But Tarpley's coming up in the last hour to talk about Fort Hood.
[01:13:04.979 --> 01:13:06.960]  You want the inside skinny, get ready.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be very informative.
[01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:10.703]  Call your friends and family.
[01:13:10.703 --> 01:13:13.385]  Please tell them to tune in right now.
[01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:13.585]  So,
[01:13:18.823 --> 01:13:21.824]  It just makes my head spin to know that they were running a drill at Fort Hood.
[01:13:21.824 --> 01:13:23.745]  That's been confirmed.
[01:13:23.745 --> 01:13:29.567]  At the same time, there is just no end to what these people do.
[01:13:29.567 --> 01:13:33.729]  Okay, let's go ahead and I can play the clips of the drills on 9-11 if you'd like.
[01:13:33.729 --> 01:13:36.430]  I mean, I'm not making any of this up.
[01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:38.791]  And the drill on April 19th.
[01:13:38.791 --> 01:13:41.652]  On and on and on.
[01:13:41.652 --> 01:13:47.354]  Police, doctors, others showed up less than one minute after the Alfred P. Murrow building got blown to bits.
[01:13:49.039 --> 01:13:51.980]  And they asked the BATF, why are you in full bomb gear?
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:53.240]  How are you already here?
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:59.522]  And one of them told the local doctor, he said, say that I was on the top floor and fell in the elevator and bandaged my leg.
[01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:02.903]  And the doctor said, I've got real people to help, you're not hurt.
[01:14:02.903 --> 01:14:05.063]  Police officers noted this.
[01:14:05.063 --> 01:14:06.603]  Of course, they got killed later.
[01:14:06.603 --> 01:14:08.464]  Terence Yakey got tortured to death.
[01:14:08.464 --> 01:14:10.584]  He was publicly saying it was an inside job.
[01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:12.305]  Man, they took him and tortured him something.
[01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:13.946]  Something fierce.
[01:14:13.946 --> 01:14:16.708]  You can search the term Terence Yakey's autopsy.
[01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:17.969]  They tortured him bad.
[01:14:17.969 --> 01:14:19.291]  I'm not going to go over all the torture.
[01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:21.032]  It was hard core.
[01:14:21.032 --> 01:14:23.715]  He called his partner and said, I got FBI tailing me.
[01:14:23.715 --> 01:14:26.217]  That was the last he was ever heard of.
[01:14:26.217 --> 01:14:31.903]  Whether they were FBI or not, he thought they were FBI and they, they, they tortured him bad to find out what else he knew.
[01:14:31.903 --> 01:14:35.946]  They don't play games.
[01:14:35.946 --> 01:14:37.488]  And the BATF said, Oh, we were here.
[01:14:37.488 --> 01:14:38.188]  Part of a drill.
[01:14:39.062 --> 01:14:41.163]  Yeah, you were part of a drill, all right.
[01:14:41.163 --> 01:14:48.547]  And the BATF was running a drill six months before in the New Mexico desert, blowing up Ryder trucks with ammonium nitrate.
[01:14:48.547 --> 01:14:49.507]  Oh, that's admitted.
[01:14:49.507 --> 01:14:51.808]  See, I could go on and on and on.
[01:14:51.808 --> 01:14:53.950]  The more you study this, the more you understand.
[01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:56.511]  You think it's fun going up against these killers?
[01:14:56.511 --> 01:14:58.712]  These people will blow up their own federal buildings.
[01:14:58.712 --> 01:15:03.034]  They picked it because it had a daycare.
[01:15:03.034 --> 01:15:04.675]  McVeigh got mad about that.
[01:15:04.675 --> 01:15:06.036]  That's come out in federal documents.
[01:15:06.721 --> 01:15:13.163]  He said, he told Terry Nichols, he said, look, I'm a deep cover federal operative meant to flush out militias and terrorists.
[01:15:13.163 --> 01:15:14.703]  We've been set up.
[01:15:14.703 --> 01:15:16.143]  I'm angry about this target.
[01:15:16.143 --> 01:15:17.263]  There's kids in there!
[01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:22.665]  He was probably starting to figure out he was a patsy.
[01:15:22.665 --> 01:15:30.587]  Let me tell you something, if you're a fed or a federal informant, and they're asking you to take part in a drill, one time out of a hundred, you might get set up.
[01:15:30.587 --> 01:15:31.907]  The other times it may just be a drill.
[01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:36.003]  They ask you to run around with a machine gun in front of a building?
[01:15:36.003 --> 01:15:37.044]  Don't do it.
[01:15:37.044 --> 01:15:39.845]  They ask you to carry a backpack on a train to see if you can get through security?
[01:15:39.845 --> 01:15:40.465]  Don't do it.
[01:15:40.465 --> 01:15:44.907]  They ask you to carry a fake bomb on an aircraft, which the ATF gets caught all the time doing?
[01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:46.528]  And, oh, it was just a drill.
[01:15:46.528 --> 01:15:49.209]  Yeah, it's just a drill most of the time until it goes live.
[01:15:49.209 --> 01:15:53.091]  Do you understand me?
[01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:55.672]  Your bosses are murdering psychopaths!
[01:15:55.672 --> 01:15:57.613]  The government's corrupt and evil!
[01:15:57.613 --> 01:15:58.493]  Period!
[01:15:58.493 --> 01:15:59.634]  There's no fixing it!
[01:16:02.287 --> 01:16:03.989]  Read the Declaration of Independence.
[01:16:03.989 --> 01:16:06.111]  We've got to arrest these people.
[01:16:06.111 --> 01:16:08.053]  We've got to set our government up again.
[01:16:08.053 --> 01:16:10.676]  Under the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[01:16:10.676 --> 01:16:12.779]  I can't believe I'm Alex Jones.
[01:16:12.779 --> 01:16:14.481]  I can't believe I know all this stuff.
[01:16:14.481 --> 01:16:18.585]  I can't believe I've been studying it for 16 years, on air 14 years.
[01:16:18.585 --> 01:16:22.069]  I can't believe how clear it is to me because I know their M.O.
[01:16:22.069 --> 01:16:23.491]  They've been caught over and over again.
[01:16:24.844 --> 01:16:28.705]  And I just can't believe it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:16:28.705 --> 01:16:37.026]  I have to watch it happen in slow motion and I'm sick of it.
[01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:49.109]  And all the weasel media whores that love the system and love attacking me and lying about me, it's just... I'm not whining, I just... It's a great weight, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:53.649 --> 01:16:56.270]  But even if I try to deny it to myself, the tyranny is still there.
[01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:58.390]  It doesn't go away just because I wish it would.
[01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:59.050]  Don't you understand?
[01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:01.031]  I know why a lot of you are in denial.
[01:17:01.031 --> 01:17:03.551]  I know, I understand your defense mechanism psychologically.
[01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:04.731]  You don't want to believe this.
[01:17:04.731 --> 01:17:06.472]  It's true though!
[01:17:06.472 --> 01:17:09.452]  It's all real!
[01:17:09.452 --> 01:17:10.173]  Let's go to calls.
[01:17:10.173 --> 01:17:10.893]  I'm shutting up.
[01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:11.873]  Let's go to calls.
[01:17:11.873 --> 01:17:12.873]  Don in Wisconsin.
[01:17:12.873 --> 01:17:14.333]  We already went to Don.
[01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:15.774]  Who's up next?
[01:17:15.774 --> 01:17:16.414]  Or is Don next?
[01:17:17.352 --> 01:17:18.913]  Pardon me?
[01:17:18.913 --> 01:17:19.854]  Okay, Renee in Florida.
[01:17:19.854 --> 01:17:21.275]  Renee, go ahead.
[01:17:21.275 --> 01:17:24.778]  Hey Alex, it's an honor to be on your show.
[01:17:24.778 --> 01:17:33.626]  I finally am beginning to get my voice back today from heckling Al Gore, the new World Order carbon whore, on Saturday night.
[01:17:33.626 --> 01:17:35.067]  Oh, I saw your photo online.
[01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.889]  Are you the one that had the carbon whore sign?
[01:17:36.889 --> 01:17:37.950]  Yes, I am.
[01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:41.312]  That was my beloved sign.
[01:17:41.312 --> 01:17:44.035]  Well, you're beloved to all of us out there fighting that maggot.
[01:17:46.556 --> 01:17:55.904]  Hey listen, I would love nothing more than to pass that sign along to another Info Warrior to the next town the scumbag visits.
[01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:56.965]  Shipping is on me.
[01:17:56.965 --> 01:17:57.946]  Can we make that happen?
[01:17:57.946 --> 01:18:03.370]  Yeah, I don't know if I can match-make that deal, but people can make their carbon whore sign.
[01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:08.955]  But I don't want to disagree with you, but he's more of a carbon pimp.
[01:18:08.955 --> 01:18:13.118]  We're the carbon whores that go out and work to pay the pimp.
[01:18:13.118 --> 01:18:13.999]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:18:13.999 --> 01:18:14.700]  Very good point.
[01:18:16.072 --> 01:18:19.353]  Well, what's on your mind today?
[01:18:19.353 --> 01:18:23.114]  Well, hey, you took over the news media there, so Gore couldn't have it one way.
[01:18:23.114 --> 01:18:24.514]  Good job.
[01:18:24.514 --> 01:18:26.414]  Tell us what you're up to today.
[01:18:26.414 --> 01:18:32.836]  Well, I'm just sitting back reading about, we have another Ponzi scheme going on in Fort Lauderdale.
[01:18:32.836 --> 01:18:40.898]  There's a lawyer that, he Ponzi-schemed about a billion dollars, and you don't really see it on mainstream media.
[01:18:41.474 --> 01:18:49.342]  I'm surprised none of the, you know, well, I'm not surprised because he's got a lot of political people in his corner, like John McCain.
[01:18:49.342 --> 01:18:50.803]  Yeah, they want to sweep it out of the rug.
[01:18:50.803 --> 01:18:56.749]  There's all sorts of Ponzi schemes by all, I mean, most of the top people in the stock market, in the government.
[01:18:56.749 --> 01:19:00.072]  And, but tell me about the latest case.
[01:19:00.072 --> 01:19:03.215]  He just, this is a lawyer, downtown Fort Lauderdale.
[01:19:03.215 --> 01:19:04.537]  It's alleged that he had
[01:19:05.814 --> 01:19:06.074]  I don't
[01:19:23.396 --> 01:19:28.277]  The guy ran off two weeks ago to Morocco.
[01:19:28.277 --> 01:19:30.558]  Yeah, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:31.818]  Unfolding as we see it.
[01:19:31.818 --> 01:19:33.559]  We got Madoff in West Palm Beach.
[01:19:33.559 --> 01:19:36.580]  We got Scott Rothstein in Fort Lauderdale.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:38.640]  It's never ending down here.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.401]  You got the other guy that stole $18 billion in Houston.
[01:19:42.401 --> 01:19:46.222]  But none of that's anything compared to Goldman Sachs and the big Ponzi scheme.
[01:19:46.222 --> 01:19:48.443]  The housing deal they rigged, according to McClatchy.
[01:19:50.732 --> 01:19:55.975]  Hey, did that snibbler Al Gore like you standing up to him?
[01:19:55.975 --> 01:19:57.276]  I don't think so.
[01:19:57.276 --> 01:19:58.317]  Definitely not.
[01:19:58.317 --> 01:20:01.038]  He couldn't hear himself speak.
[01:20:01.038 --> 01:20:06.181]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:11.825]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[01:20:11.825 --> 01:20:12.905]  The answer is simple.
[01:20:16.328 --> 01:20:16.608]  I think so.
[01:20:33.485 --> 01:20:47.572]  PureBulk.com carries Atomic Iodine, Red Wine Extract, Gingko Biloba, Oil of Oregano, Natural Coffee Caffeine, L-Arginine, Resveratrol, Hyaluronic Acid, Creatine, Curcumin, Pine Bark Extract, Grape Seed Extract, and more.

[01:21:01.943 --> 01:21:05.965]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:05.965 --> 01:21:09.207]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.207 --> 01:21:14.009]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.009 --> 01:21:17.791]  I have tremendous influence on our president and Congress.
[01:21:18.491 --> 01:21:20.392]  And they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.392 --> 01:21:25.934]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[01:21:25.934 --> 01:21:28.856]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:21:28.856 --> 01:21:35.698]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:35.698 --> 01:21:38.039]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.039 --> 01:21:39.640]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.081]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.081 --> 01:21:44.222]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.222 --> 01:21:45.743]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:49.345]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.345 --> 01:21:58.469]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:22:00.908 --> 01:22:05.171]  Thomas Jefferson once said, when the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:08.452]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[01:22:08.452 --> 01:22:16.237]  Our God-given right to life and liberty, and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health, are in jeopardy if we the people
[01:22:16.497 --> 01:22:18.738]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[01:22:18.738 --> 01:22:21.120]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.944]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:34.127]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[01:22:34.127 --> 01:22:35.128]  Please stand with Utopia Silver.
[01:22:35.148 --> 01:22:35.528]  Let's do it!
[01:23:00.106 --> 01:23:04.710]  Worried that inflation will ruin your retirement or plans of sending your kids to college?
[01:23:04.710 --> 01:23:05.690]  Get a pencil.
[01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:07.972]  Discover how to turn $10,000 into possibly $431,000 in the next 12 to 18 months.
[01:23:07.972 --> 01:23:11.955]  For example, investors who took Scott Smith's advice and invested $10,000 in Silver Standard Resources turned it into $431,000.
[01:23:22.663 --> 01:23:28.468]  And those who invested in Seabridge Gold shares turned $10,000 into $800,000.
[01:23:28.468 --> 01:23:35.274]  Scott Smith is the former senior executive of Credit Suisse and editor of Swiss Confidential, an investment newsletter.
[01:23:35.274 --> 01:23:41.339]  He's urging everyone afraid of the nearly $2 trillion in new debt to get his Inflation Survival Kit.
[01:23:41.339 --> 01:23:46.203]  It details seven must-own stocks, including a gold stock with six-figure potential,
[01:23:48.371 --> 01:23:49.833]  To get his free kit, call 877-727-2461.
[01:23:49.833 --> 01:23:50.133]  That's 877-727-2461.
[01:23:50.133 --> 01:23:51.554]  Or go to his website, InflationSurvivalKit.com.
[01:24:23.052 --> 01:24:26.355]  Welcome to your life.
[01:24:26.355 --> 01:24:28.356]  There's no turning back.
[01:24:28.356 --> 01:24:31.518]  Alright, let's go through calls really quick now.
[01:24:31.518 --> 01:24:33.239]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:24:33.239 --> 01:24:35.081]  Welcome.
[01:24:35.081 --> 01:24:36.202]  Morning, Alex.
[01:24:36.202 --> 01:24:37.422]  Hey, buddy.
[01:24:37.422 --> 01:24:38.023]  Hey, man.
[01:24:39.055 --> 01:24:39.916]  Great to speak with you.
[01:24:39.916 --> 01:24:44.418]  I hope you had a good time this weekend getting out there in the great outdoors.
[01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:46.659]  God's creation.
[01:24:46.659 --> 01:24:55.564]  I did, but I had to run the gauntlet driving out to our family homestead in East Texas of more police than I've ever seen feeding on the slaves.
[01:24:55.564 --> 01:24:57.005]  I know, I remember you mentioning that.
[01:24:57.005 --> 01:24:58.165]  It's all scary.
[01:24:58.165 --> 01:25:00.426]  It's all evil.
[01:25:00.426 --> 01:25:05.389]  Alex, not the main reason I called, but I wanted to mention real quick that Bob Chapman was on
[01:25:06.112 --> 01:25:21.389]  Dr. Sam Monteith showed yesterday and they were in the conversation about MK Ultramind Control and it was brought up in the conversation between the two gentlemen that the, and I can't remember whether it was Bob or Dr. Sam that mentioned it, but that the
[01:25:22.385 --> 01:25:27.227]  Uh, Fort Hood Shooter had actually attended Virginia Tech, and I'm sure you're aware.
[01:25:27.227 --> 01:25:34.330]  Yes, yes, he went to the Blacksburg School, where we've confirmed there was an MKUltra base, and that's been confirmed.
[01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:40.052]  There was a secretive DARPA mind control facility outside the university.
[01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:41.353]  And that's where he went.
[01:25:41.353 --> 01:25:43.734]  Yeah, no, look, he's a psychiatrist, folks.
[01:25:43.734 --> 01:25:46.855]  Wait till Tarpley comes on the last hour.
[01:25:46.855 --> 01:25:51.817]  That's where the Chinese student, uh, about a year, a little over a year ago, shot 31 people dead.
[01:25:52.512 --> 01:25:53.313]  Right.
[01:25:53.313 --> 01:26:08.602]  Alex, I think I have some very good news for the parents who have their children stolen by the so-called Child Protective Services, as well as abortion protesters who have been illegally persecuted for exercising their constitutional right to protest peacefully.
[01:26:08.602 --> 01:26:14.686]  About two weeks ago, on Pastor Butch Paw's show, his guest was Doug Napier.
[01:26:14.686 --> 01:26:17.588]  And Doug is a lawyer who founded the Alliance Defense Fund.
[01:26:18.311 --> 01:26:38.726]  Which is a group of 16,000 lawyers throughout the nation who provide free legal representation in the court systems and free legal advice to people who have been illegally persecuted for exercising the First Amendment right of peaceful protest, said protest being based around Christian-oriented issues such as abortion.
[01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:47.792]  I called the show to ask Mr. Napier if his organization would represent parents who've lost their children to CPS kidnapping in whatever legal venue would be appropriate.
[01:26:48.402 --> 01:26:51.404]  Okay, give folks their website, Mark, and I'm going to jump to the next caller.
[01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:22.773]  Well, I don't know if they want their number given out, but I believe we've had that organization on before.
[01:27:22.773 --> 01:27:23.994]  Sure, give it out, Mark.
[01:27:23.994 --> 01:27:28.357]  It's 1-800-TELL-ADF.
[01:27:28.357 --> 01:27:29.918]  It's a match for the website.
[01:27:29.918 --> 01:27:30.799]  Tell ADF.
[01:27:30.799 --> 01:27:31.819]  Alright, thank you so much.
[01:27:31.819 --> 01:27:34.381]  We've had a lot of those groups on, fighting for parents.
[01:27:34.381 --> 01:27:35.442]  Thank you so much, Mark.
[01:27:35.442 --> 01:27:37.223]  Holly in New Jersey.
[01:27:37.223 --> 01:27:38.224]  Holly, you're on the air.
[01:27:38.224 --> 01:27:39.845]  Um, hello?
[01:27:39.845 --> 01:27:40.025]  Hey!
[01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:44.964]  Hi, um, yeah, I just started listening to your show probably about like a month or two ago.
[01:27:44.964 --> 01:27:46.825]  Good to have you on board.
[01:27:46.825 --> 01:27:47.665]  Oh, thank you.
[01:27:47.665 --> 01:27:54.709]  Um, well, my boyfriend's mom was saying something about this new health care bill and I was wondering if you knew anything about this.
[01:27:54.709 --> 01:28:09.936]  Um, they were saying something about that if you, um, let's say you want to go to school for, um, anything involving like medical, um, and you get any type of federal aid, like you're, you have to participate in the new, like,
[01:28:12.963 --> 01:28:17.945]  Well, ma'am, it doesn't matter if you're getting government aid that you have to participate.
[01:28:17.945 --> 01:28:29.609]  Everyone has to go get insurance and you have money taken out of your check, 2.5 to 5 percent depending on your tax bracket, and there's five years in prison, quarter million dollar fine to begin with.
[01:28:29.609 --> 01:28:30.870]  That is in the bill.
[01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:37.293]  It has the rationing, unelected boards that are immune from any type of judicial or
[01:28:39.445 --> 01:28:42.146]  You know, any type of civil or criminal penalties.
[01:28:42.146 --> 01:28:43.726]  And it allows these rationing boards.
[01:28:43.726 --> 01:28:46.387]  I mean, that's what England and Canada and Germany have.
[01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:48.788]  That's why they all come here for health care.
[01:28:48.788 --> 01:28:51.049]  And, ma'am, it's so horrible.
[01:28:51.049 --> 01:28:53.910]  You know, we had the first five versions, and they were all bad.
[01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:56.271]  This one is worse than those.
[01:28:56.271 --> 01:28:59.072]  And they're set to start debating it on the Senate floor today.
[01:28:59.072 --> 01:29:01.533]  In fact, we should check the health care bill.
[01:29:01.533 --> 01:29:03.913]  But they could bring it out any time.
[01:29:03.913 --> 01:29:05.154]  It may be out on the floor right now.
[01:29:05.994 --> 01:29:11.598]  After, of course, all the Republican channels told us, oh, we're beating it, don't worry, it won't pass the House.
[01:29:11.598 --> 01:29:12.819]  And it did.
[01:29:12.819 --> 01:29:14.940]  And then, oh, don't worry, it won't pass the Senate committee.
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:15.461]  Oh, it did.
[01:29:15.461 --> 01:29:19.343]  And now, Harry Reid announced it was going to the floor today.
[01:29:19.343 --> 01:29:20.144]  I don't know.
[01:29:20.144 --> 01:29:21.865]  Sometimes they move it around.
[01:29:21.865 --> 01:29:23.466]  But they love baiting and switching.
[01:29:23.466 --> 01:29:25.447]  But does that answer your question?
[01:29:25.447 --> 01:29:27.189]  Yeah, I was going to ask that.
[01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:30.791]  And I can't think.
[01:29:30.791 --> 01:29:32.572]  Like, I have Medicaid.
[01:29:32.572 --> 01:29:34.614]  And I was wondering, like, what's going to happen to that?
[01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:39.041]  Uh, well a whole host of things.
[01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:40.402]  A whole host of things, but stay there.
[01:29:40.402 --> 01:29:42.543]  I'm gonna try to answer your question when we get back.
[01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:51.066]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.066 --> 01:29:52.447]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.447 --> 01:29:54.988]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.988 --> 01:29:57.689]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.339 --> 01:30:09.486]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[01:30:09.486 --> 01:30:12.848]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[01:30:12.848 --> 01:30:18.733]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[01:30:18.733 --> 01:30:23.496]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[01:30:23.496 --> 01:30:25.858]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[01:30:26.118 --> 01:30:26.499]  I'm good.
[01:30:42.722 --> 01:30:42.942]  I think so.
[01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:03.971]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.971 --> 01:31:09.293]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.293 --> 01:31:11.354]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.354 --> 01:31:16.356]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.356 --> 01:31:17.537]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.537 --> 01:31:18.657]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.657 --> 01:31:20.538]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.538 --> 01:31:21.618]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.618 --> 01:31:23.819]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.819 --> 01:31:25.160]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:26.681]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:27.721]  If there's a quarantine,
[01:31:27.881 --> 01:31:29.223]  And you can't feed yourself?
[01:31:29.223 --> 01:31:31.926]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.926 --> 01:31:35.530]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:39.354]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.354 --> 01:31:40.576]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.576 --> 01:31:41.477]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.477 --> 01:31:42.578]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.578 --> 01:31:43.339]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.339 --> 01:31:44.320]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.643]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[01:31:59.912 --> 01:32:06.894]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:32:06.894 --> 01:32:08.975]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:32:08.975 --> 01:32:11.215]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:32:11.215 --> 01:32:12.876]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:33:00.093 --> 01:33:06.535]  Hey Alex, I was talking to my mom about vaccinations and if you should, if you shouldn't kind of thing.
[01:33:06.535 --> 01:33:12.838]  And we have a friend of the family who runs a security company in Pennsylvania.
[01:33:13.977 --> 01:33:15.917]  Um, in the Allentown area?
[01:33:15.917 --> 01:33:25.640]  Anyway, she started telling me that, uh, a lot of his business lately has been installing security systems on farms.
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:37.102]  Believe it or not, they're installing cameras and security systems on chicken farms to protect the eggs for future vaccine production.
[01:33:37.102 --> 01:33:41.623]  I'm wondering what they're planning next.
[01:33:41.623 --> 01:33:42.263]  That's all I got.
[01:33:49.329 --> 01:33:53.252]  And here's another clip from the phone system.
[01:33:53.252 --> 01:33:56.674]  Yeah, this might not be 60 seconds long.
[01:33:56.674 --> 01:34:09.682]  Mr. Jones, could you do America a big favor and get some bumper stickers out there that says, kick the bums out?
[01:34:09.682 --> 01:34:13.184]  Kick the bums out of the house and say, let's just kick them out.
[01:34:13.184 --> 01:34:15.166]  Let's just kick them out.
[01:34:15.166 --> 01:34:17.127]  They're not doing anything for their nation.
[01:34:17.808 --> 01:34:19.690]  Kick the bombs out.
[01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:27.456]  I think if we can get these circulated before midterm, it's going to make a big, big difference.
[01:34:27.456 --> 01:34:34.622]  And it might even cause some of them to change their mode of thinking.
[01:34:34.622 --> 01:34:38.605]  If not, just go along with policy and kick the bombs out.
[01:34:38.605 --> 01:34:40.467]  But we need those bumper stickers.
[01:34:40.467 --> 01:34:41.808]  We need slogans.
[01:34:41.808 --> 01:34:44.690]  We need to just drape the whole United States
[01:34:45.495 --> 01:34:46.115]  Thank you.
[01:35:15.631 --> 01:35:20.313]  It's a great idea!
[01:35:20.313 --> 01:35:26.856]  We need to make up some flags that say, throw the bombs out on one side, stop the new world order on the other.
[01:35:26.856 --> 01:35:30.077]  Infowars.com.
[01:35:30.077 --> 01:35:32.358]  Okay, let's continue with Holly in New Jersey.
[01:35:32.358 --> 01:35:34.198]  What was your other question, ma'am?
[01:35:34.198 --> 01:35:41.061]  Well, um, like I get Medicaid because, um, like, you know, I can't really afford regular insurance and stuff.
[01:35:42.037 --> 01:35:44.299]  I was wondering, what's going to end up happening with that?
[01:35:44.299 --> 01:35:49.062]  Well, look, I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:35:49.062 --> 01:35:55.266]  It's a 1,960 something page bill.
[01:35:55.266 --> 01:35:57.587]  And so is the climate bill.
[01:35:57.587 --> 01:35:59.969]  And so I've gone through the subsections.
[01:36:01.004 --> 01:36:06.013]  Basically what it does is it does set up the rationing panels that are called death panels.
[01:36:06.013 --> 01:36:09.880]  It gives a 2.5 to 5% tax depending on your tax bracket.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.607]  Then it also on top of that forces you to get insurance.
[01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:16.064]  I think?
[01:36:35.819 --> 01:36:48.245]  And then for people that are supposedly getting the free health care, they're going to cut your benefits, and cut what you have access to.
[01:36:48.245 --> 01:37:00.791]  And look, that's why Dennis Kucinich, I don't agree with Dennis Kucinich and his socialism, but I really respect him because he went public for 9-11 Truth, he went public on Halliburton dying court torture, and all the rest of it.
[01:37:02.012 --> 01:37:07.174]  And he's a real socialist, a real collectivist, and he said, this isn't collectivism, this isn't socialism.
[01:37:07.174 --> 01:37:11.816]  He's written editorials called Dennis Kucinich, Why I Voted Against the Health Care Bill.
[01:37:11.816 --> 01:37:17.559]  And he wrote another one, Dennis Kucinich, titled, Health Care Bill is a Bailout for Insurance Companies.
[01:37:17.559 --> 01:37:19.300]  They wrote it!
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:30.325]  I mean, I have a New York Times article today, but it kind of whitewashes it like it's a good thing, that says, oh, the talking points for the Republican and Democratic leadership, this is on the Drudge Report today, of all places,
[01:37:31.015 --> 01:37:32.346]  You know, they're linked to it.
[01:37:32.346 --> 01:37:33.233]  It was written...
[01:37:34.383 --> 01:37:38.465]  Buy Big Pharma for both sides.
[01:37:38.465 --> 01:37:52.613]  They would write talking points for both sides, and it says the Republicans, it has the talking points, would be, well, this plan isn't all bad, it's got some good provisions, telling them, this is how you can act like you're conservative and not get voted out, but still let it pass, okay?
[01:37:52.613 --> 01:37:57.496]  This is our strategy, because if you really fight it, you can kill it.
[01:37:57.496 --> 01:38:00.478]  So, we'll still keep funding you, just come out and talk about
[01:38:01.218 --> 01:38:04.761]  You have a problem with it, but it does have some good areas.
[01:38:04.761 --> 01:38:06.202]  And this is all in the New York Times.
[01:38:06.202 --> 01:38:09.305]  And then for the Democrats, oh, this poor woman died.
[01:38:09.305 --> 01:38:11.827]  She was waiting on health care.
[01:38:11.827 --> 01:38:12.808]  It's all staged.
[01:38:12.808 --> 01:38:26.179]  And so, if we have a banker bailout, if we have a bank re-regulation system, if we have a health care plan, anything they do will be used to rob us further.
[01:38:26.179 --> 01:38:27.240]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:38:29.369 --> 01:38:31.531]  They will package something as one thing.
[01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:33.532]  They say zig, they zag.
[01:38:33.532 --> 01:38:34.933]  They say up, they go down.
[01:38:34.933 --> 01:38:39.476]  They say left, they go right.
[01:38:39.476 --> 01:38:41.057]  They say blue, it's red.
[01:38:41.057 --> 01:38:42.639]  They say green, it's purple.
[01:38:42.639 --> 01:38:46.902]  I mean, it's just... It's a tissue of lies.
[01:38:46.902 --> 01:38:57.009]  It's a full spectrum dominance of propaganda and disinformation and throwing it in your face and spinning and lying by omission and just frothing from every angle.
[01:38:57.861 --> 01:38:58.882]  But I know their tricks.
[01:38:58.882 --> 01:38:59.602]  I know their angles.
[01:38:59.602 --> 01:39:00.363]  I know their game plan.
[01:39:00.363 --> 01:39:02.224]  I've seen them do it in other countries in this country.
[01:39:02.224 --> 01:39:04.786]  And I can look at it and I can read their language.
[01:39:04.786 --> 01:39:08.628]  That's how we can tell you what's going to happen in the future.
[01:39:08.628 --> 01:39:13.932]  Because not only can I analyze their propaganda, everything they're going to do is in white papers.
[01:39:13.932 --> 01:39:16.274]  The white papers you never see on the news.
[01:39:16.274 --> 01:39:17.635]  They all communicate with each other.
[01:39:17.635 --> 01:39:19.816]  There's millions of these parasites.
[01:39:19.816 --> 01:39:22.098]  There's 6,000 super class controllers.
[01:39:23.294 --> 01:39:27.156]  Now, I already estimated the controllers at 5,000 to 6,000.
[01:39:27.156 --> 01:39:32.858]  Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, two years ago published a book called Superclass.
[01:39:32.858 --> 01:39:42.582]  The 6,000 people that run the world and the whole books, world government, new world order, and how they run it all.
[01:39:42.582 --> 01:39:47.144]  6,000 people with millions of minions that are compartmentalized that have large pieces of it.
[01:39:47.144 --> 01:39:48.485]  They just like the paychecks they're getting.
[01:39:48.485 --> 01:39:49.185]  They're mercenaries.
[01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:58.743]  Mercenary cops, mercenary military, mercenary politicians, mercenary corporate chiefs, mercenary bureaucrats, mercenaries!
[01:39:58.743 --> 01:40:01.324]  They don't care what their job does to society.
[01:40:01.324 --> 01:40:02.805]  They lie to themselves.
[01:40:02.805 --> 01:40:07.969]  There's interdepartmental propaganda to make everybody feel good about what they're part of and what they're doing.
[01:40:07.969 --> 01:40:09.850]  It is sick!
[01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:17.135]  And you can sit there and have them give you Kool-Aid with societal cyanide in it and tell yourself it didn't cure death, but I'm here to tell you it's bad!
[01:40:20.031 --> 01:40:23.234]  Terry in Ohio, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:40:23.234 --> 01:40:25.857]  Yes, Alex, been on, talked to you before.
[01:40:25.857 --> 01:40:33.944]  Tried to leave a message with you on your hotline there, but you say the number so fast you can't get it all.
[01:40:33.944 --> 01:40:35.206]  Let me give you the number.
[01:40:35.206 --> 01:40:35.566]  Okay.
[01:40:35.566 --> 01:40:36.887]  5-1-2.
[01:40:36.887 --> 01:40:37.448]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:37.448 --> 01:40:37.888]  6-4-6.
[01:40:37.888 --> 01:40:38.249]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:38.249 --> 01:40:38.309]  4-4-4-4.
[01:40:44.019 --> 01:40:45.119]  Thank you.
[01:40:45.119 --> 01:40:47.960]  I can give that to the people in the church.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.220]  I wanted to call and tell you.
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:50.141]  I'm here from Ohio.
[01:40:50.141 --> 01:40:51.241]  I've talked to you before.
[01:40:51.241 --> 01:40:52.881]  I'm the pastor.
[01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:55.962]  Chemtrails are going out of sight.
[01:40:55.962 --> 01:41:05.685]  They have been spraying this southeastern Ohio so heavily that half the time when the sun shines through, you can't see the sun.
[01:41:05.685 --> 01:41:06.685]  You only get the light.
[01:41:07.233 --> 01:41:18.979]  Terry, you're not the pastor in Ohio three and a half years ago that sent me the secret FEMA documents about the clergy response teams and how the preachers were all being hired by the tens of thousands.
[01:41:18.979 --> 01:41:19.780]  Yes, I am.
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.281]  Oh, wow.
[01:41:21.281 --> 01:41:25.463]  Now, this happened to two preachers, one from Arkansas, one from Ohio.
[01:41:25.463 --> 01:41:28.625]  You're the guy that got the FEMA visit.
[01:41:28.625 --> 01:41:30.746]  Actually got the FEMA papers.
[01:41:32.236 --> 01:41:32.336]  No.
[01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:32.416]  No.
[01:41:32.416 --> 01:41:33.137]  Yes sir, three years.
[01:41:53.191 --> 01:42:02.699]  You sent me those documents, people didn't believe them, and then what was it like for you, two years later, to see mainstream news admit everything you'd said?
[01:42:02.699 --> 01:42:05.361]  Oh, the preachers are training to help you go to camps!
[01:42:05.361 --> 01:42:07.923]  Oh, the preachers are training you to help turn your guns in!
[01:42:07.923 --> 01:42:16.470]  The preachers are going to be here during martial law, and for anyone that denies it, just Google clergy response teams, you'll get mainstream TV newscasts.
[01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:17.350]  I mean, again,
[01:42:18.231 --> 01:42:21.992]  This would be like if they resurrected Hitler and said, how Hitler, we love him.
[01:42:21.992 --> 01:42:24.113]  We know what tyranny is.
[01:42:24.113 --> 01:42:26.993]  We know what it is.
[01:42:26.993 --> 01:42:41.437]  Well, I mentioned, uh, when I, they would have had me except for one thing is when we started the church, the Lord laid on my heart not to go and become 501c3.
[01:42:41.437 --> 01:42:44.718]  So we chose as a church not to do it.
[01:42:45.533 --> 01:42:57.579]  And I told the people right up front, hey look, if you're coming here to give your money, your ties, and your offerings just so you can write them off on your taxes, you might as well go to the one on down the road because you're not going to be able to do that here.
[01:42:57.579 --> 01:43:04.743]  And we lost about 60 families, but that's alright.
[01:43:04.743 --> 01:43:09.065]  But the chemtrails around here are just unbelievable.
[01:43:09.065 --> 01:43:10.106]  What is it like for you?
[01:43:11.638 --> 01:43:13.719]  to talk about chemtrails.
[01:43:13.719 --> 01:43:14.980]  I know they're spraying us.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:20.644]  The scientists we've interviewed that have tested them said they were barium salts, aluminum dioxide.
[01:43:20.644 --> 01:43:32.292]  It's all denied, and then nine months ago, ten months ago, the new White House science czar, John P. Holdren, comes out in his first press conference and says, we are controlling the weather.
[01:43:32.292 --> 01:43:36.195]  We've done a study so far with barium salts, aluminum dioxide.
[01:43:36.195 --> 01:43:38.377]  Now we're about to go to the full project.
[01:43:38.977 --> 01:43:47.499]  Well, not only that, but I was part of a pastor's association to where we all get together as a group so we can get cut rates on our insurance and things like that.
[01:44:04.648 --> 01:44:17.373]  I was, because I was relaying this information to other pastors, giving them the documented proof, because everything that you have said, you always give where to go to get it.
[01:44:17.373 --> 01:44:18.813]  Well, that's what I did.
[01:44:18.813 --> 01:44:27.837]  So I would have documented proof to show the other pastors and reverends and all, whatever they all want to call themselves, but I would show them that.
[01:44:28.783 --> 01:44:37.837]  And even though you had it right in their face, you had all the documents, the letterhead, everything.
[01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:44.035]  They still deny... I mean, it's like they are so blind.
[01:44:44.035 --> 01:44:45.215]  Well, this is how it works, though.
[01:44:45.215 --> 01:44:50.278]  At first, if they hadn't been approached yet, now they double the program each year.
[01:44:50.278 --> 01:44:52.999]  So it's well over 60,000 right now that we know of.
[01:44:52.999 --> 01:44:55.300]  That number's about a year and a half old.
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:56.761]  So it's probably 120,000.
[01:44:56.761 --> 01:44:59.302]  They go to the bigger preachers first.
[01:45:01.365 --> 01:45:04.388]  People know that's, well let me just finish, people know that's tyranny.
[01:45:04.388 --> 01:45:11.935]  They know secret FEMA brainwashing of preachers, telling them we're going to pay you to go tell your flock to submit to tyranny.
[01:45:11.935 --> 01:45:15.218]  People know that's hardcore Red Dawn level evil.
[01:45:15.218 --> 01:45:25.468]  But, once it got announced nationally, suddenly I've seen preachers defending it and preachers on the news saying, suddenly, oh yeah it's good, I'm telling you go to the FEMA camp.
[01:45:25.828 --> 01:45:28.409]  But then Glenn Beck says the FEMA camps don't exist.
[01:45:28.409 --> 01:45:33.530]  FEMA's just publicly teaching preachers to tell people to go to the FEMA camp when they're told.
[01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:36.631]  See how this is just pure delusion?
[01:45:36.631 --> 01:45:45.254]  Well, you want to hear something better, and you probably don't know this, but I got this information from those that I am affiliated with.
[01:45:45.254 --> 01:45:53.576]  Depending upon the size of your church, you can get upwards to $3,000 a month that you don't have to report.
[01:45:55.137 --> 01:46:00.402]  Yes, I know that.
[01:46:00.402 --> 01:46:04.465]  They're getting new vans, they're getting jumbo TVs.
[01:46:04.465 --> 01:46:09.449]  All they've got to do is say, submit to government, take the shots, don't be involved politically.
[01:46:09.449 --> 01:46:15.675]  The local Baptist churches in Austin hand out handouts saying don't even talk about politics if you go to eat lunch after church.
[01:46:17.556 --> 01:46:21.618]  The new Bible is about submitting to government, worshiping government.
[01:46:21.618 --> 01:46:22.678]  This is what Hitler did.
[01:46:22.678 --> 01:46:24.719]  It's what the Chinese Communists did.
[01:46:24.719 --> 01:46:27.680]  Yes, but if you've gotten new documents, please send them to us.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:34.002]  But I do know that under the faith-based initiative, which Obama, by the way, is continuing, they're buying off the churches.
[01:46:34.002 --> 01:46:46.167]  Again, Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, a secret program buying off all the major TV, a secret program buying off all the major churches, a secret program, and then now it's all public.
[01:46:47.097 --> 01:46:48.358]  All public.
[01:46:48.358 --> 01:46:50.518]  I mean, think about the magnitude of this.
[01:46:50.518 --> 01:46:54.800]  But, because they denied it at first, it's not polite to talk about it.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.162]  Well, yeah, my preacher's on secret payroll of FEMA.
[01:46:58.162 --> 01:47:01.043]  That's not creepy.
[01:47:01.043 --> 01:47:02.183]  Anything else?
[01:47:02.183 --> 01:47:03.063]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:03.063 --> 01:47:10.226]  I talk to the police on a pretty regular basis in the town that I'm from.
[01:47:10.226 --> 01:47:16.689]  And they, I just, just recently, just this past week, I had a conversation with a lieutenant.
[01:47:17.714 --> 01:47:20.816]  And his comment was this.
[01:47:20.816 --> 01:47:29.840]  They get visited by Homeland Security or a representative from them once a month to get updates.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.984]  Yes, under the federal grants, they are telling the local counties under the name of Emergency Management everything they've got to do.
[01:47:36.984 --> 01:47:38.765]  The police are being totally federalized.
[01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.370]  I don't
[01:47:54.232 --> 01:48:11.706]  He knew nothing at all about Oath Keepers, but they know everything about you when you come on, because as soon as I mentioned, well, you need to listen to Alex Jones, and I gave him how to get on, and what to do, and the times you come on.
[01:48:11.706 --> 01:48:13.888]  I gave him all that information.
[01:48:13.888 --> 01:48:16.130]  They knew, he knew everything.
[01:48:16.130 --> 01:48:19.793]  They are letting all of them know about you,
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.001]  And what you talk about and things like that.
[01:48:25.001 --> 01:48:37.886]  And they give them information on how to actually talk and convince themselves that what you are laying over your program is not all true.
[01:48:37.886 --> 01:48:39.427]  Alright, let's stop there.
[01:48:39.427 --> 01:48:40.387]  I've seen the manuals.
[01:48:40.387 --> 01:48:41.828]  It's called Kernel of Truth.
[01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:50.496]  And they, again, they understand, and I hate to admit this on air because it's very dangerous, but they already know it, so why not just admit it?
[01:48:50.496 --> 01:48:56.602]  They understand, for whatever reason, this country boy from Texas has got their number.
[01:48:56.602 --> 01:48:59.044]  I see right through him on every point.
[01:48:59.044 --> 01:49:01.026]  It's a nightmare to actually be able to see.
[01:49:01.026 --> 01:49:05.690]  It's, I mean, a lot of you probably are blessed you actually don't see the full picture.
[01:49:05.690 --> 01:49:07.191]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:07.191 --> 01:49:08.152]  And they know
[01:49:09.213 --> 01:49:10.574]  I can wake them up.
[01:49:10.574 --> 01:49:12.435]  They know I can reach out to them.
[01:49:12.435 --> 01:49:16.238]  They know I can deprogram them if they'll deprogram themselves.
[01:49:16.238 --> 01:49:29.566]  If they'll just go look and find out I'm not lying, that over 90% of the EPA scientists signed a petition, now it's two years ago, asking that fluoride be taken out, that it is causing cancer and is deadly and brain-damaging people.
[01:49:29.566 --> 01:49:30.747]  Now don't believe me.
[01:49:30.747 --> 01:49:33.649]  You know, when they tell you there's no mercury in the shot, officers,
[01:49:34.309 --> 01:49:35.749]  Go get the insert.
[01:49:35.749 --> 01:49:36.190]  Okay?
[01:49:36.190 --> 01:49:37.690]  Find out who's lying to you.
[01:49:37.690 --> 01:49:39.551]  And you're going to find out it's the federal government.
[01:49:39.551 --> 01:49:41.131]  They work for Madoff.
[01:49:41.131 --> 01:49:43.132]  They work for Ken Lay.
[01:49:43.132 --> 01:49:45.413]  That's the type of people they work for.
[01:49:45.413 --> 01:49:47.493]  And you better choose sides.
[01:49:47.493 --> 01:49:50.254]  Because you only got one shot at being right here.
[01:49:50.254 --> 01:49:50.554]  Okay?
[01:49:50.554 --> 01:49:52.535]  You got one shot.
[01:49:52.535 --> 01:49:56.736]  And yes, I've been told and I've seen how they demonize.
[01:49:56.736 --> 01:49:59.457]  And so, let me ask you this.
[01:49:59.457 --> 01:50:02.698]  Was he buying what he's told by Homeland Security?
[01:50:03.635 --> 01:50:13.880]  Well, he wrote down the information I gave him, and how to get on your program and everything, but that wasn't the main thing.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:23.884]  I gave him the information how to get on to Oaks Keepers, and I told him, I said, hey look, God is going to hold you accountable
[01:50:24.673 --> 01:50:36.519]  For every person, when you break down the doors and you start fire on people, because according to his Ten Commandments, that is murder, and you will be held accountable for it.
[01:50:36.519 --> 01:50:50.606]  Oh my gosh, stay there, I just remembered, I'm up at 3-4 in the morning, I've been up for a few hours, couldn't sleep, and I'm on YouTube, and there's suddenly these full-page ads that take over the screen, where it shows U.S.
[01:50:50.606 --> 01:50:53.287]  Army, it's a National Guard ad, kicking in doors.
[01:50:54.642 --> 01:50:58.295]  It shows the foot kicking a door, but then it cuts to them saving a family.
[01:50:58.295 --> 01:50:59.439]  They're getting everybody ready.
[01:50:59.439 --> 01:51:00.021]  Stay there.
[01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:04.162]  Do you want to get away from additives and preservatives in your food?

[01:51:06.803 --> 01:51:09.383]  Do you want to save the fruits of your gardening labor?
[01:51:09.383 --> 01:51:11.744]  And are you looking for an excellent gift idea?

[01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.410]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:07.994]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.994 --> 01:52:13.017]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.017 --> 01:52:18.601]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.

[01:53:00.881 --> 01:53:04.662]  Heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year.
[01:53:04.662 --> 01:53:14.807]  Maybe you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, unbalanced cholesterol, irregular heartbeat, or clogged arteries.

[01:54:06.192 --> 01:54:11.395]  The global controllers are scared to death that you're going to educate the police.
[01:54:11.395 --> 01:54:21.342]  The New World Order spent a lot of time slowly twisting them, slowly bringing them over to the dark side, slowly teaching them that evil is good and good is evil.
[01:54:21.342 --> 01:54:24.384]  It's not going well for them.
[01:54:24.384 --> 01:54:33.449]  A lot of police have woken up because they said, yeah, we used to listen to you because, you know, it was entertaining, but a lot of us bought gold five, six years ago and have quadrupled our money.
[01:54:33.449 --> 01:54:34.270]  We really like you.
[01:54:35.627 --> 01:54:38.230]  I mean, think about it on every issue, on every front.
[01:54:38.230 --> 01:54:38.731]  We're right.
[01:54:38.731 --> 01:54:39.211]  We're right.
[01:54:39.211 --> 01:54:39.672]  We're right.
[01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:40.152]  We're right.
[01:54:40.152 --> 01:54:40.593]  We're right.
[01:54:40.593 --> 01:54:41.333]  We're right.
[01:54:41.333 --> 01:54:42.855]  Because this is what I do.
[01:54:42.855 --> 01:54:51.244]  I mean, I found out the UN wanted to take over my country's sovereignty and set up a police state 16 years ago, and I got involved.
[01:54:51.244 --> 01:54:55.108]  And two years later, I was on the radio and TV locally in Austin.
[01:54:55.108 --> 01:54:56.890]  And two years after that, I was syndicated.
[01:54:59.397 --> 01:55:03.380]  Because there was still some freedom left, but let me tell you, the shadows are getting long.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:09.064]  The sun is setting on the Republican freedom, and there's not time to screw around.
[01:55:09.064 --> 01:55:18.311]  But it is bone-chilling to know that Homeland Security has got my number.
[01:55:18.311 --> 01:55:20.232]  I know everything I do is surveilled.
[01:55:20.232 --> 01:55:21.794]  I know everything I do is watched.
[01:55:21.794 --> 01:55:23.295]  It's even come out in federal court before.
[01:55:24.235 --> 01:55:28.796]  I know they've got top Nazis that go after me, they control, that's come out in federal court.
[01:55:28.796 --> 01:55:32.437]  They've got the fake left, George Soros, coming after me.
[01:55:32.437 --> 01:55:39.599]  And I'm forced to talk about this more and more because, I mean, this is serious.
[01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:41.500]  And whatever they do to me, they're the criminals.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:47.882]  Whatever they, however they set me up, or whatever they do to me, that's their issue, and they gotta deal with God on that.
[01:55:48.906 --> 01:55:56.192]  And the only reason they haven't smashed me flatter than a pancake is they've tried to destroy me other ways, and they've had some success.
[01:55:56.192 --> 01:55:57.113]  I'm almost kind of glad.
[01:55:57.113 --> 01:56:13.167]  Oh, I'm glad you've been effective at some levels, because I'm not perfect either, because, you know, the flesh in me says, oh, well, you know, maybe if I let them tear me up a bit, I'll, and maybe I subconsciously clown around sometimes.
[01:56:14.428 --> 01:56:15.569]  Because I think that'll protect me.
[01:56:15.569 --> 01:56:18.052]  I mean, later in hindsight, I realized that.
[01:56:18.052 --> 01:56:24.459]  But then I get more and more focused, more and more serious, more and more penetrating, and they don't like it.
[01:56:24.459 --> 01:56:27.141]  And people know I'm for real.
[01:56:27.141 --> 01:56:28.963]  They know this radio show's for real.
[01:56:28.963 --> 01:56:30.465]  Warts and all.
[01:56:30.465 --> 01:56:32.487]  And the globalists don't like it because it's authentic.
[01:56:32.487 --> 01:56:34.669]  More than anything, it's authentic, and we know what's going on.
[01:56:38.596 --> 01:56:39.958]  No one is immune from this.
[01:56:39.958 --> 01:56:44.584]  And I'm a fighter, like any other normal man who's got his head screwed on half straight.
[01:56:44.584 --> 01:56:48.609]  When a bunch of criminals try to come down on me and my family and my country, I fight them.
[01:56:48.609 --> 01:56:50.452]  And I don't buy their propaganda, their lies.
[01:56:50.452 --> 01:56:52.114]  I don't buy into their disinfo.
[01:56:52.114 --> 01:56:53.316]  I'm a free man.
[01:56:53.316 --> 01:56:54.137]  And my mind is free.
[01:56:56.055 --> 01:57:04.060]  But finishing up, Terry in Ohio, or I remembered his voice, he's one of the pastors that gave us the secret FEMA documents, now national news years later, confirmed.
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:11.925]  Just like we get MIAC reports and Homeland Security reports demonizing veterans and patriots and gun owners from police and federal marshals and others.
[01:57:11.925 --> 01:57:15.167]  We get a lot of key info from people like Terry.
[01:57:15.167 --> 01:57:17.108]  Terry, we got about a minute left, minute and a half left.
[01:57:17.108 --> 01:57:22.431]  Finish up your point, because you're telling them, hey, you're going to be judged by God in all of this.
[01:57:22.431 --> 01:57:24.792]  They're going to be judged by more than that, too.
[01:57:24.792 --> 01:57:25.433]  The world.
[01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:28.750]  Well, you know, my wife made that same comment when I
[01:57:50.805 --> 01:57:54.186]  Come back in and told her the conversation.
[01:57:54.186 --> 01:57:57.368]  But one thing I gotta tell you, Alex.
[01:57:57.368 --> 01:58:00.489]  You are a watchman.
[01:58:00.489 --> 01:58:03.050]  And you're not the only one.
[01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:08.892]  And as a watchman, you know, whether you want to be or you don't want to be, I mean, it's just like with me.
[01:58:08.892 --> 01:58:11.813]  You know, I really didn't want to get into the pastorate.
[01:58:11.813 --> 01:58:15.775]  I was making good money, but then when God called me into it, well, here I am.
[01:58:15.775 --> 01:58:18.716]  But as a watchman, you know, God put this out there.
[01:58:19.352 --> 01:58:22.133]  To warn the people, to let them know what's going on.
[01:58:22.133 --> 01:58:30.414]  And as a watchman, you stand with a sword in one hand and the Bible with the information in the other hand.
[01:58:30.414 --> 01:58:33.075]  And you, being a watchman, that's where you stand.
[01:58:33.075 --> 01:58:41.216]  And the thing about it is, is if you kill the watchman... Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:41.216 --> 01:58:46.077]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.

[02:00:10.232 --> 02:00:11.833]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.833 --> 02:00:12.754]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.754 --> 02:00:17.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.576 --> 02:00:26.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:31.283]  Continuing with your phone calls throughout the final two hours we have here in front of us.
[02:00:32.898 --> 02:00:35.980]  Webster Tarpley pops in for 30 minutes in the next hour.
[02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:41.062]  He's done a detailed breakdown and analysis of what happened at Fort Hood a few weeks ago.
[02:00:41.062 --> 02:00:45.585]  He says it looks like an inside job false flag op with a drill they were running.
[02:00:45.585 --> 02:00:48.686]  That's coming up with Dr. Tarpley.
[02:00:48.686 --> 02:00:52.528]  Towards the end of the last hour, I'm going to play some clips from the Watchmen movie.
[02:00:52.528 --> 02:00:53.889]  I saw it a few months ago in theaters.
[02:00:53.889 --> 02:00:55.290]  I got the DVD.
[02:00:55.290 --> 02:00:57.091]  I want to show you a clip of the end of the film.
[02:00:58.083 --> 02:01:07.496]  Where the Luciferian character stages a terror attack worldwide to bring in world government to save everyone, to end war.
[02:01:07.496 --> 02:01:09.740]  And Dr. Manhattan, the new God-man...
[02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:13.972]  The Illuminati believes they're building towards.
[02:01:13.972 --> 02:01:20.977]  He then understands and thanks these previous bad guy for staging the terror attacks.
[02:01:20.977 --> 02:01:24.679]  It's total Illuminati revelation of the method in your face.
[02:01:24.679 --> 02:01:26.801]  That's coming up at the end of the broadcast today.
[02:01:26.801 --> 02:01:30.083]  I'm gonna break that down.
[02:01:30.083 --> 02:01:32.084]  Right now let's go back quickly to Terry.
[02:01:32.084 --> 02:01:33.866]  I've had Terry on for several segments because
[02:01:35.267 --> 02:01:36.568]  I hadn't talked to him in a long time.
[02:01:36.568 --> 02:01:37.388]  I guess he got through.
[02:01:37.388 --> 02:01:44.293]  He's one of the pastors that sent me the secret FEMA clergy response team documents right at two years before it broke mainstream news.
[02:01:44.293 --> 02:01:47.475]  People couldn't believe it that they were secretly recruiting the preachers.
[02:01:47.475 --> 02:01:50.317]  And yes, I do feel like I am a watchman at the gates.
[02:01:50.317 --> 02:01:51.698]  This huge army is marching up.
[02:01:51.698 --> 02:01:53.459]  They're battering down the door.
[02:01:53.459 --> 02:01:57.242]  Traitors inside the castle are opening the drawbridge.
[02:01:57.242 --> 02:02:00.524]  And I'm telling the lazy population, hey, we're being overrun here.
[02:02:00.524 --> 02:02:05.067]  And they're saying, shut up, conspiracy theorist, as flaming arrows come over the parapets.
[02:02:07.509 --> 02:02:19.978]  If you kill the watchman, the people become aware and they become ready to fight.
[02:02:19.978 --> 02:02:26.563]  So what always happens is they never usually go for the watchman himself because he's the lookout.
[02:02:26.563 --> 02:02:28.264]  He stands out above everyone else.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:38.142]  Exactly, that's predatory logic.
[02:02:38.142 --> 02:02:50.016]  That's like lions and tigers and other wolves, coyotes, go after the weak sheep, or the weak deer, or the weak gazelle, because if you shoot the head blackbird, the one that
[02:02:50.456 --> 02:02:50.516]  Is
[02:03:09.133 --> 02:03:11.514]  And the other thing I wanted to point out to you Alex is
[02:03:30.473 --> 02:03:30.873]  I don't know.
[02:03:50.203 --> 02:03:54.470]  In the mainstream news, I mean, more and more, you see it on the news.
[02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:59.697]  Every time they have a police or chasing someone to get to the houses, whatever, everyone is in...
[02:04:01.656 --> 02:04:04.357]  And Jungle Garb, you know, using military uniforms.
[02:04:04.357 --> 02:04:07.859]  They're acclimating us to the same uniforms, yes.
[02:04:07.859 --> 02:04:12.981]  And I also wanted to mention, I sent you an email on this about the Continental Congress.
[02:04:12.981 --> 02:04:17.823]  It started on November 11th, it's in session for 21 days in Illinois.
[02:04:17.823 --> 02:04:21.504]  Nobody, nobody is even talking about it.
[02:04:21.504 --> 02:04:24.745]  Well, we've talked about it a few times, and I'm not poo-pooing it.
[02:04:24.745 --> 02:04:28.287]  I mean, it's a good group to focus and come up with ideas, and I appreciate your call.
[02:04:28.287 --> 02:04:30.148]  It's good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:04:30.148 --> 02:04:30.808]  It's just that
[02:04:31.926 --> 02:04:35.747]  The Continental Congress was the leaders of the 13 colonies.
[02:04:35.747 --> 02:04:43.908]  So if there were 13 governors or 13 legislative heads meeting saying they were seceding from the Union, believe me, we'd be covering it.
[02:04:43.908 --> 02:04:54.270]  It's just, it's kind of like the Republic of Texas 12, 13, 14 years ago just declaring themselves president right off the bat.
[02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:56.690]  No, you go to the legislature and do that.
[02:04:56.690 --> 02:04:58.991]  And Texas does have a right to secede.
[02:04:58.991 --> 02:04:59.591]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.635 --> 02:05:05.942]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:05:05.942 --> 02:05:10.468]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:05:10.468 --> 02:05:12.751]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:05:12.751 --> 02:05:14.373]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:05:14.373 --> 02:05:15.395]  There is a solution.
[02:05:15.635 --> 02:05:24.060]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:31.524]  Try their Inner Food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[02:05:37.547 --> 02:05:43.130]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[02:06:00.543 --> 02:06:09.689]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[02:06:09.689 --> 02:06:13.051]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[02:06:13.051 --> 02:06:18.915]  Instead, use vitamin C, D, and OxySilver, along with ZeoLife for broad-spectrum detoxification.
[02:06:18.915 --> 02:06:23.698]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[02:06:23.698 --> 02:06:26.040]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:26.540]  Thank you.
[02:06:45.154 --> 02:06:48.857]  To order OxySilver or to find out more, visit OxySilver.net.
[02:06:48.857 --> 02:06:51.059]  That's O-X-Y Silver dot net.

[02:07:00.447 --> 02:07:03.828]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[02:07:03.828 --> 02:07:07.449]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:07:07.449 --> 02:07:12.030]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:16.571]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:07:16.571 --> 02:07:20.452]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes,
[02:07:20.452 --> 02:07:21.153]  We're good to go.
[02:07:40.114 --> 02:07:43.315]  With a solar power generator from Solutions from Science.
[02:07:43.315 --> 02:07:47.815]  Go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[02:07:47.815 --> 02:07:49.976]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:07:49.976 --> 02:07:50.036]  877-327-0365.
[02:07:50.036 --> 02:07:50.596]  Don't wait.
[02:07:50.596 --> 02:07:51.096]  Call today.
[02:07:51.096 --> 02:07:55.277]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:55.277 --> 02:07:56.717]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.445 --> 02:08:17.088]  I am here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:17.088 --> 02:08:17.648]  to 3 p.m.
[02:08:17.648 --> 02:08:18.709]  Central Standard Time.
[02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:20.650]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[02:08:20.650 --> 02:08:21.451]  Eastern.
[02:08:21.451 --> 02:08:31.899]  We always simulcast in the last two hours at PrisonPlanet.tv when the radio show, the syndicated radio broadcast, shift gears and becomes a television show as well.
[02:08:33.624 --> 02:08:38.107]  I have a huge news blitz I want to go over now that will continue with your phone calls.
[02:08:38.107 --> 02:08:44.932]  Then Dr. Webster Griffin Tarbley, Doctor of History and Economics, is joining us for 30 minutes in the last hour to detail a
[02:08:47.981 --> 02:08:58.486]  Massively researched piece, he wrote, 4infowars.com, asking the question, was the Fort Hood shooter a patsy part of a drill?
[02:08:58.486 --> 02:09:00.827]  And the evidence shows that is the case.
[02:09:00.827 --> 02:09:02.928]  So that's coming up later in the last hour.
[02:09:02.928 --> 02:09:05.729]  Also, my review of The Watchman.
[02:09:05.729 --> 02:09:08.390]  I saw it a few months ago in the theater.
[02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:09.271]  I now have the DVD.
[02:09:09.271 --> 02:09:16.574]  I'm going to play a few minutes of it from the end, where this secret society stages terror attacks worldwide.
[02:09:19.039 --> 02:09:29.167]  To then bring in a world government for world peace, and Dr. Manhattan, the good guy, decides, oh, I see, I love it that you nuked a bunch of cities and killed a bunch of people.
[02:09:29.167 --> 02:09:30.649]  That's loving!
[02:09:30.649 --> 02:09:32.230]  The end justifies the means.
[02:09:32.230 --> 02:09:41.557]  So, massively evil, total Illuminati programming, but this will give you an idea of their mindset as they give the public the revelation of the method.
[02:09:41.557 --> 02:09:42.899]  But as I walked out of the theater,
[02:09:43.519 --> 02:09:50.728]  People all around are saying, I don't get it, I don't understand, and all these editorials and all these articles said no one gets The Watchman.
[02:09:50.728 --> 02:09:52.289]  No one understands it.
[02:09:52.289 --> 02:09:54.052]  It's clear in your face.
[02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:59.598]  A five-year-old should be able to understand this, but people have a compulsion to not see the truth.
[02:09:59.598 --> 02:09:59.778]  So...
[02:10:01.021 --> 02:10:01.882]  That is coming up.
[02:10:01.882 --> 02:10:07.226]  Also, IMF head eyes global currency change, presses on yuan.
[02:10:07.226 --> 02:10:09.528]  So they're now moving away from the dollar.
[02:10:09.528 --> 02:10:10.949]  This is going to be devastating.
[02:10:10.949 --> 02:10:14.391]  You think the economy's bad with really over 20% unemployment.
[02:10:14.391 --> 02:10:15.812]  Government says over 10.
[02:10:15.812 --> 02:10:18.094]  All the big mainline economists say over 20.
[02:10:18.094 --> 02:10:19.195]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:10:19.195 --> 02:10:22.557]  It could all stop if we remove the New World Order bankers.
[02:10:22.557 --> 02:10:26.941]  I'm identifying them, not the liberals, not the conservatives, not their puppets.
[02:10:28.294 --> 02:10:38.159]  But phase one in ending the Fed, removing the economic dictatorship, is first shattering the left-right paradigm so people understand that Republicans come and go.
[02:10:38.159 --> 02:10:46.604]  But the eugenics empire run by the big banks, the eco-science system that the White House science czar talks about remains the same.
[02:10:46.604 --> 02:10:52.007]  But I did want to have a bit of a light moment here on air today.
[02:10:53.571 --> 02:10:58.352]  In my hand, I'm holding a new form of toilet paper.
[02:10:58.352 --> 02:11:07.274]  And in the last decade or so, I've seen Republicans and Conservatives and Libertarians put out paper that has the United Nations symbol on it.
[02:11:07.274 --> 02:11:09.654]  And I've seen them put it out that has Democrats on it.
[02:11:09.654 --> 02:11:17.056]  Or I've seen the Liberals put out toilet paper that has George Bush on it.
[02:11:17.056 --> 02:11:21.457]  But we're now seeing a bellwether of toilet paper selling all over the Internet.
[02:11:22.219 --> 02:11:51.719]  That does have Bank Pork Frank, Fraud Dodd, Bankster, Palsy Pelosi, Greedy Reed, Bankster Buddy Obama, Beltway, Backroom Biden, but then it says SEC No Evil Cox, McPork McCain, Allen Fraud Scam, Ben Bankster Buddy Bailout Bernanke,
[02:11:52.884 --> 02:11:54.965]  Ka-ching Cheney.
[02:11:54.965 --> 02:11:58.287]  Bankster Buddy Bush the Moron.
[02:11:58.287 --> 02:12:01.049]  It's bipartisan toilet paper!
[02:12:01.049 --> 02:12:03.230]  I remember years ago saying we need toilet paper.
[02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:06.753]  But they do take themselves a little too seriously.
[02:12:06.753 --> 02:12:13.016]  This is from BanksterBuster.com.
[02:12:13.016 --> 02:12:16.359]  We want to thank Dave for sending us this.
[02:12:16.359 --> 02:12:18.180]  I was sent two rolls.
[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:20.061]  We will use this in the office.
[02:12:21.311 --> 02:12:25.614]  Back today, we'll go put these on the rolls if you guys are happy with it.
[02:12:25.614 --> 02:12:27.796]  And here we are.
[02:12:27.796 --> 02:12:28.957]  But it is a bellwether.
[02:12:28.957 --> 02:12:30.818]  People are getting it.
[02:12:30.818 --> 02:12:32.479]  And I went and looked after I saw this this morning.
[02:12:32.479 --> 02:12:35.282]  There's lots of brands of bipartisan toilet paper.
[02:12:35.282 --> 02:12:36.242]  Throw the bums out.
[02:12:36.242 --> 02:12:37.423]  They're all puppets.
[02:12:37.423 --> 02:12:43.548]  Except for people like Ron Paul who transcend the left-right paradigm and point out the real power structure.
[02:12:43.548 --> 02:12:46.430]  Stuff like Anna Nicole Smith isn't what's important.
[02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:47.371]  Or OJ Simpson.
[02:12:49.198 --> 02:12:50.920]  This is what is important.
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:52.862]  Shattering the left-right paradigm.
[02:12:52.862 --> 02:12:55.524]  So, very, very, very excited.
[02:12:55.524 --> 02:12:56.886]  In fact, I need to sneeze.
[02:12:56.886 --> 02:13:02.211]  Maybe I should use it as a tissue.
[02:13:02.211 --> 02:13:03.533]  Okay.
[02:13:03.533 --> 02:13:04.774]  Thought I'd have a little bit of fun there.
[02:13:08.581 --> 02:13:22.687]  Let's now go ahead and get into a news blitz here, and then back to Jim, Jerry, Steve, Gabe, Mike, and others that are patiently holding.
[02:13:22.687 --> 02:13:36.313]  Paul Watson wrote a story about this, but it's in the BBC, it's in the Surrey newspaper, it's all over the British news, and they are reporting it like it is a
[02:13:38.075 --> 02:13:39.418]  Good thing.
[02:13:39.418 --> 02:13:40.480]  Guilty.
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:47.054]  Paul Clark faces at least five years in prison, that's the minimum sentence, for handing in a discarded shotgun.
[02:13:49.144 --> 02:13:52.847]  This is out of the Surrey newspaper.
[02:13:52.847 --> 02:13:55.188]  You guys printed me a printer version.
[02:13:55.188 --> 02:13:59.371]  Can I have the actual official version so people can see the letterhead and the news article?
[02:13:59.371 --> 02:14:02.414]  They don't tend to believe it unless it's from an official letterhead.
[02:14:02.414 --> 02:14:04.415]  However, this printer didn't print right.
[02:14:04.415 --> 02:14:13.221]  But you can also read a story that gives you a larger perspective on this at PrisonPlanet.com, written by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:14:13.221 --> 02:14:17.725]  And it says, in his backyard, he saw a black shotgun.
[02:14:18.513 --> 02:14:19.553]  So he called the police.
[02:14:19.553 --> 02:14:21.955]  He's a military veteran, no criminal record.
[02:14:21.955 --> 02:14:22.755]  See, you served them.
[02:14:22.755 --> 02:14:24.376]  That's why they don't like you.
[02:14:24.376 --> 02:14:25.476]  That's who they're worried about.
[02:14:25.476 --> 02:14:26.396]  You've served them now.
[02:14:26.396 --> 02:14:28.577]  Now they want to give you a record.
[02:14:28.577 --> 02:14:31.819]  And he calls the police department and says, I'm going to bring this gun down to you.
[02:14:31.819 --> 02:14:32.739]  And they were waiting for him.
[02:14:32.739 --> 02:14:36.561]  And they said, touching a gun is illegal.
[02:14:36.561 --> 02:14:45.785]  The jury was instructed to convict him, being total 1984 puppets that would make Hitler proud and Stalin proud and Mao as well.
[02:14:47.025 --> 02:14:56.192]  They have a quote in here by the prosecutor, Brian Stalk, explained to the jury that possession of a firearm was a strict liability charge.
[02:14:56.192 --> 02:14:58.213]  See, it's this term.
[02:14:58.213 --> 02:15:03.417]  There's the actual article, Surrey Today, one of many.
[02:15:03.417 --> 02:15:05.159]  That's what zero tolerance is about.
[02:15:05.159 --> 02:15:10.383]  It's about targeting the mainstream, targeting people that are good, to terrorize them.
[02:15:10.383 --> 02:15:11.964]  That's the essence of their mind control.
[02:15:14.346 --> 02:15:18.450]  He said, therefore, Mr. Clark's allegedly honest intent was irrelevant.
[02:15:18.450 --> 02:15:24.716]  Just by having the gun in his possession, he was guilty of the charge and has no defense in law against it, he added.
[02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:29.540]  But despite this, Mr. Blackman urged members of the jury to consider how they would respond if they found the gun.
[02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:33.204]  He said, this is a very small case with a very big principle.
[02:15:33.204 --> 02:15:37.428]  So they're saying they're making an example out of him.
[02:15:39.434 --> 02:15:41.155]  And he'll be sentenced December 11th.
[02:15:41.155 --> 02:15:45.279]  The minimum sentence is five years in prison and a hefty fine.
[02:15:45.279 --> 02:15:48.461]  Go read the articles at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:15:48.461 --> 02:15:49.462]  We have links to the article.
[02:15:49.462 --> 02:15:56.288]  We wrote our own story about it and added the articles of where people defend themselves with a knife when they're being attacked in their house.
[02:15:56.288 --> 02:15:57.729]  They get thrown in prison.
[02:15:57.729 --> 02:16:01.212]  The rapist gets released.
[02:16:01.212 --> 02:16:02.413]  We are the milk cows.
[02:16:02.413 --> 02:16:03.934]  We are the slaves.
[02:16:03.934 --> 02:16:07.217]  We are the aphids that the ants keep, basically milk.
[02:16:08.468 --> 02:16:13.394]  And the message is you don't touch a gun.
[02:16:13.394 --> 02:16:14.956]  And it's meant to be absurdist.
[02:16:14.956 --> 02:16:16.198]  It's meant to be over the top.
[02:16:16.198 --> 02:16:21.885]  It's meant to shock us and train us to accept even more corruption and evil.
[02:16:21.885 --> 02:16:22.846]  It's like this army
[02:16:23.877 --> 02:16:28.520]  Enlisted lady who had a baby and they CPS'ed it and said you're not allowed to have babies while you're in the military.
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:32.623]  We're CPS'ing your baby and you're going back to Afghanistan.
[02:16:32.623 --> 02:16:34.143]  No other government's ever done that.
[02:16:34.143 --> 02:16:35.304]  The Soviets didn't do that.
[02:16:35.304 --> 02:16:36.325]  The Nazis didn't do that.
[02:16:36.325 --> 02:16:37.846]  The Israelis don't do that.
[02:16:37.846 --> 02:16:39.027]  The Cubans don't do that.
[02:16:39.027 --> 02:16:40.147]  The Germans don't do that.
[02:16:40.147 --> 02:16:41.088]  The British don't do that.
[02:16:42.495 --> 02:16:43.276]  It's absurd.
[02:16:43.276 --> 02:16:54.204]  It's like England announcing in many cities, you've got to have a license to be outdoors with your kid and be certified by the government that you're allowed to be with your child in public because you may be a pedophile.
[02:16:54.204 --> 02:16:55.746]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[02:16:55.746 --> 02:17:04.272]  Everything for the children, but then real pedophiles and the UN who've been caught running giant child kidnapping rings, they don't get in trouble.
[02:17:04.272 --> 02:17:10.237]  You see how they're training you to just accept unbelievably ridiculous things?
[02:17:10.237 --> 02:17:10.917]  You understand?
[02:17:12.133 --> 02:17:13.875]  How and why this is being done?
[02:17:13.875 --> 02:17:21.145]  Do you understand what this larger system is really all about?
[02:17:21.145 --> 02:17:25.751]  I mean, are you ready to understand that you're being conditioned and trained to accept more and more?
[02:17:25.751 --> 02:17:28.675]  It's like what happened two months ago at the G20.
[02:17:30.791 --> 02:17:35.415]  One of the activists was using Twitter when the police went down to the University Park.
[02:17:35.415 --> 02:17:36.796]  Most of the people weren't even protesting.
[02:17:36.796 --> 02:17:38.958]  It was a Friday night.
[02:17:38.958 --> 02:17:40.379]  I had three reporters there.
[02:17:40.379 --> 02:17:41.240]  One of them got arrested.
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:42.080]  Rob Dew got arrested.
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:43.542]  Burmese barely made it out.
[02:17:44.602 --> 02:17:51.067]  Bermas was, I told Bermas that night, he called me, I said, they're encircling the park, they're gonna arrest everybody, get out now.
[02:17:51.067 --> 02:17:53.649]  Jason listened to me, I couldn't get a hold of Dew.
[02:17:53.649 --> 02:18:00.874]  Dew was there with the mainstream media, they let them out, but arrested him, then put a bunch of false charges on him that we're now beating in court.
[02:18:00.874 --> 02:18:02.536]  They even got the wrong day of his arrest in.
[02:18:02.536 --> 02:18:05.018]  And we have video of what happened.
[02:18:05.018 --> 02:18:06.659]  They didn't erase the tapes, thank God.
[02:18:06.659 --> 02:18:08.801]  They did erase some people's tapes.
[02:18:08.801 --> 02:18:12.944]  They beat up and tortured Luke Radowski, had the military do it in a state prison.
[02:18:12.944 --> 02:18:14.185]  I mean, it was hellish for him.
[02:18:16.423 --> 02:18:25.327]  But why did they, in broad daylight on the Wednesday before that Friday, two days before, why did they go around with loudspeakers blurring?
[02:18:25.327 --> 02:18:27.328]  No one's allowed on the streets of Pittsburgh.
[02:18:27.328 --> 02:18:34.111]  Why did they drive up and hit with sound cannons nine-year-old kids with their footballs in their front yards?
[02:18:34.111 --> 02:18:37.193]  We have video of them driving around neighborhoods.
[02:18:37.193 --> 02:18:38.693]  Why did they use police dogs?
[02:18:38.693 --> 02:18:42.575]  Old ladies came out of a store with bags and were like, officer, what's wrong?
[02:18:42.575 --> 02:18:44.496]  Get the bleep out of here, lady.
[02:18:44.496 --> 02:18:45.957]  Releases the dogs to bite them.
[02:18:46.980 --> 02:18:53.165]  They would chase down because they couldn't find anybody who was violating the curfew to not be on the streets day or night.
[02:18:53.165 --> 02:18:54.306]  It was all randomly enforced.
[02:18:54.306 --> 02:18:59.270]  So they went to the university where the college kids were and girls would run on bikes and the police would run up.
[02:18:59.270 --> 02:19:03.954]  We showed the video and knock them off and then beat them with blood spewing out of their heads.
[02:19:03.954 --> 02:19:06.617]  And the cops are like, what, you don't like law enforcement coming?
[02:19:09.096 --> 02:19:11.937]  So all of this is going on.
[02:19:11.937 --> 02:19:13.078]  All of this is happening.
[02:19:13.078 --> 02:19:15.999]  It's meant to be absurd.
[02:19:15.999 --> 02:19:18.960]  It's meant to be over the top.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:22.041]  It's meant to be, why are police dogs biting old ladies?
[02:19:22.041 --> 02:19:27.483]  Why are police dogs in public schools with the kids lined up in random searches, biting and ripping the bags open?
[02:19:27.483 --> 02:19:35.366]  Why are they tasering old women and pregnant women who ask why they have to sign a ticket or argue and say they weren't speeding?
[02:19:35.366 --> 02:19:38.007]  Why are they arresting a veteran who brings a shotgun in?
[02:19:39.448 --> 02:19:43.929]  He calls them and says, I got a shotgun, and they're waiting to pounce on him, saying you're not allowed to touch it.
[02:19:43.929 --> 02:19:47.070]  They want to train you to just be paralyzed and go, I'll do whatever you say!
[02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:48.591]  I'll do whatever you say!
[02:19:48.591 --> 02:19:52.192]  And they admit, we're making an example out of you.
[02:19:52.192 --> 02:19:59.714]  That's why people will bring Dixie cups and knives to school to have a pie, and they'll arrest them saying they had knives.
[02:20:06.266 --> 02:20:07.607]  A question for you.
[02:20:07.607 --> 02:20:09.828]  Do you know what is in the air you're breathing?
[02:20:09.828 --> 02:20:13.550]  Do you know what chemicals are placed in the water you drink?
[02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:16.252]  Would you like to combat these intrusions?
[02:20:16.252 --> 02:20:17.913]  I'm not just talking toxins.
[02:20:17.913 --> 02:20:20.694]  I'm talking about chemicals that are harmful.
[02:20:20.694 --> 02:20:23.636]  Maybe now you understand why you feel tired so much.
[02:20:24.156 --> 02:20:26.858]  Change your life with Life Change Tea.

[02:21:00.919 --> 02:21:03.100]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:03.961]  Spy on me?
[02:21:03.961 --> 02:21:04.281]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.281 --> 02:21:09.325]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[02:21:09.325 --> 02:21:10.946]  You should use Startpage instead.
[02:21:10.946 --> 02:21:11.706]  Startpage?
[02:21:11.706 --> 02:21:12.127]  Yeah.
[02:21:12.127 --> 02:21:13.207]  Startpage.com.
[02:21:13.207 --> 02:21:16.189]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[02:21:16.189 --> 02:21:20.052]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[02:21:20.052 --> 02:21:22.914]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[02:21:23.194 --> 02:21:25.795]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[02:21:25.795 --> 02:21:27.375]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[02:21:27.375 --> 02:21:27.675]  Right!

[02:22:00.743 --> 02:22:07.405]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:22:07.405 --> 02:22:15.527]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:22:15.527 --> 02:22:23.349]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:22:23.689 --> 02:22:28.771]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:22:28.771 --> 02:22:33.992]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:22:33.992 --> 02:22:38.354]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:22:38.354 --> 02:22:39.434]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:39.434 --> 02:22:43.935]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:22:43.935 --> 02:22:45.316]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:22:48.837 --> 02:22:51.839]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:22:51.839 --> 02:22:53.600]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:53.840]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:18.857 --> 02:23:22.461]  And Americans will soon be paying the price for this foolish behavior.

[02:23:47.102 --> 02:23:47.942]  Factory Direct.
[02:23:47.942 --> 02:23:49.543]  Wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.

[02:24:13.649 --> 02:24:16.211]  Was a prisoner of doubt.
[02:24:16.211 --> 02:24:19.894]  Not anymore.
[02:24:19.894 --> 02:24:22.035]  I'm going to risk my life fighting these tyrants.
[02:24:22.035 --> 02:24:24.457]  I'm going to give them 110%.
[02:24:24.457 --> 02:24:29.641]  I love that term 110% because you can always give more.
[02:24:29.641 --> 02:24:32.643]  You can always do more than you thought you could.
[02:24:32.643 --> 02:24:35.245]  The mind has a governor.
[02:24:35.245 --> 02:24:40.589]  It's like a race car or a lawnmower.
[02:24:40.589 --> 02:24:42.831]  The globalists know you have amazing power.
[02:24:44.206 --> 02:24:47.870]  And they're afraid of you turning it loose against them.
[02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:51.034]  We're coming straight on.
[02:25:13.117 --> 02:25:21.519]  The gambler understands.
[02:25:21.519 --> 02:25:31.320]  Okay, I just spent about 10 minutes on one article, and as you can see, I've probably got 20 or more here in the stack.
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:35.921]  Gonna do a Rush Limbaugh imitation.
[02:25:35.921 --> 02:25:40.182]  That's the audio version of holding up the stack on TV.
[02:25:44.022 --> 02:25:50.206]  Let me try to go through this as quickly as possible, but each one of these is just so important.
[02:25:50.206 --> 02:25:56.290]  Task Force opposes routine mammograms for women ages 40 to 49.
[02:25:56.290 --> 02:26:06.856]  Now again, it's not just what I'm about to cover, it's the understanding of these people, and you can get the same understanding.
[02:26:06.856 --> 02:26:08.718]  I know CNN's flavor of poison.
[02:26:09.611 --> 02:26:35.340]  And I knew when I read this, I already knew this report was issued because of all the other big reports by prestigious scientific organizations that aren't compartmentalized and have good scientists in them, that mammograms have been conclusively linked for more than a decade to the early onset of particularly aggressive breast cancers, malignant tumors.
[02:26:37.116 --> 02:26:48.498]  And I knew when I read it it was going to be a whitewash because lately there's been a bunch of news out where they're admitting you shouldn't get mammograms until you're above the age of 50 because the danger of cancer from the mammograms
[02:26:49.873 --> 02:26:52.394]  Outweighs the danger of getting cancer normally.
[02:26:52.394 --> 02:27:05.958]  And that's a whole other subject of the hormones in the food and the water, the same hormones that feminize men, over-feminize women, cause hormonal imbalances, soy, fluoride, mercury, you know, the list goes on and on.
[02:27:05.958 --> 02:27:08.279]  So it's not just mammograms giving you cancer.
[02:27:08.279 --> 02:27:10.579]  It's not just cell phones increasing brain cancer.
[02:27:10.579 --> 02:27:18.962]  Though it's now completely confirmed, and it turns out in 1981, when they were certifying the latest cell phone technologies that they knew then, the internal
[02:27:19.662 --> 02:27:27.445]  Telephone companies and technology companies that developed it, they knew, just like they knew Prozac made people commit suicide and go nuts.
[02:27:27.445 --> 02:27:30.406]  Homicidal mania.
[02:27:30.406 --> 02:27:33.487]  But there's several articles here, there's several points.
[02:27:33.487 --> 02:27:34.967]  I knew what it was going to say before I read it.
[02:27:34.967 --> 02:27:37.328]  And I read, and it said, oh yeah,
[02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:48.486]  They're saying they still recommend it for women 50 to 74, but they don't recommend it for women 40 to 49, but they don't say why it's recommended.
[02:27:48.486 --> 02:27:55.671]  Well, I just put in the search box, mammogram cancer risk, and got hundreds and hundreds of articles.
[02:27:55.671 --> 02:27:57.472]  I quit looking after about 30 minutes.
[02:27:57.472 --> 02:27:58.853]  I had more research to do.
[02:27:58.853 --> 02:28:03.276]  Couldn't sleep!
[02:28:03.276 --> 02:28:05.998]  Wanting to fight the New World Order.
[02:28:09.034 --> 02:28:10.635]  And the first article popped up.
[02:28:10.635 --> 02:28:11.555]  I just printed one.
[02:28:11.555 --> 02:28:13.235]  You can go read hundreds if you'd like.
[02:28:13.235 --> 02:28:14.296]  Read the studies.
[02:28:14.296 --> 02:28:17.477]  Mammograms can increase breast cancer risk.
[02:28:17.477 --> 02:28:24.819]  Here's the Mail Online 2006, major newspaper.
[02:28:24.819 --> 02:28:26.839]  And Natural News had an article.
[02:28:26.839 --> 02:28:30.080]  Mammograms offer no health benefits whatsoever, doctors conclude.
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:32.961]  And then they have all the links to the actual studies.
[02:28:32.961 --> 02:28:35.602]  An increase in breast cancer in study after study.
[02:28:37.011 --> 02:28:37.792]  Go to this article.
[02:28:37.792 --> 02:28:39.993]  It's the best one I found that had a boil down.
[02:28:39.993 --> 02:28:45.638]  I like Natural News because they're similar to us in that they do articles that are just every line is links.
[02:28:45.638 --> 02:28:47.319]  Every line is links to documents.
[02:28:47.319 --> 02:28:48.700]  I just love that.
[02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:50.422]  I just love ramming that down their throat.
[02:28:50.422 --> 02:28:53.884]  Oh, I'm a conspiracy theorist, huh?
[02:28:53.884 --> 02:28:55.386]  That Mike Adams knows what he's doing.
[02:28:55.386 --> 02:28:56.707]  I love him.
[02:28:56.707 --> 02:28:58.188]  Love that whole crew over there.
[02:28:58.188 --> 02:29:00.430]  So, they're doing a great job saving a lot of people.
[02:29:00.430 --> 02:29:04.133]  So, when you wonder why your daughter's like, ah, maybe you don't need that.
[02:29:04.133 --> 02:29:05.474]  They've been giving them to 20-year-old women.
[02:29:06.667 --> 02:29:09.509]  They also do a lot of false positives.
[02:29:09.509 --> 02:29:16.533]  I've got members of my family who had biopsies done on their lungs and it would collapse their lung or break their ribs with a rib separator and almost kill them.
[02:29:16.533 --> 02:29:24.618]  They cut my grandmother's lung out, didn't have cancer in it, and that killed her a few years later from all the complications.
[02:29:24.618 --> 02:29:27.840]  Most of these breast cancer tumors they removed were not cancerous.
[02:29:30.231 --> 02:29:32.011]  And they screw the women up that way.
[02:29:32.011 --> 02:29:37.393]  The chemotherapy drugs they give them, then give them a bunch of different blood disorders, autoimmune diseases.
[02:29:37.393 --> 02:29:44.715]  Most of the leukemias you see are now being triggered by the chemotherapy.
[02:29:44.715 --> 02:29:48.576]  I got chemotherapy killing a family member right now.
[02:29:48.576 --> 02:29:49.196]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:49.196 --> 02:29:51.596]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.596 --> 02:29:52.977]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.977 --> 02:29:55.517]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.517 --> 02:29:58.178]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.428 --> 02:30:04.450]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:30:04.450 --> 02:30:09.773]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:30:09.773 --> 02:30:11.814]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:30:11.814 --> 02:30:16.817]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:30:16.817 --> 02:30:17.698]  How much do you want?
[02:30:17.998 --> 02:30:19.119]  When do you want it?
[02:30:19.119 --> 02:30:21.000]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.081]  When will you need it?
[02:30:22.081 --> 02:30:24.283]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:30:24.283 --> 02:30:25.624]  Will there be any food?
[02:30:25.624 --> 02:30:27.145]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:30:27.145 --> 02:30:32.429]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:30:32.429 --> 02:30:36.012]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:30:36.012 --> 02:30:39.475]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:30:39.815 --> 02:30:41.036]  How much will you need?
[02:30:41.036 --> 02:30:41.936]  We don't know.
[02:30:41.936 --> 02:30:43.036]  How much do you want?
[02:30:43.036 --> 02:30:43.977]  All you can get.
[02:30:43.977 --> 02:30:45.077]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.077 --> 02:30:48.118]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:30:48.118 --> 02:30:49.899]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:49.899 --> 02:30:50.819]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:00.427 --> 02:31:05.734]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:31:05.734 --> 02:31:10.260]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:12.543]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:31:12.543 --> 02:31:14.165]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:15.207]  There is a solution.
[02:31:15.427 --> 02:31:23.849]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:37.333 --> 02:31:43.355]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:31:43.355 --> 02:31:47.497]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.

[02:32:00.367 --> 02:32:04.471]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:32:04.471 --> 02:32:07.353]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:32:07.353 --> 02:32:09.435]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[02:32:09.435 --> 02:32:11.677]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:32:11.677 --> 02:32:13.339]  And it's available right now to you.
[02:32:13.339 --> 02:32:17.823]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:32:48.153 --> 02:32:50.094]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:33:09.642 --> 02:33:10.784]  We are back live.
[02:33:10.784 --> 02:33:13.711]  I'm going to continue with my news blitz and then your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:17.759 --> 02:33:24.080]  I have done two and a half hours of radio broadcasts and haven't really plugged any of our sponsors that make this show possible.
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:25.881]  Please write down their names and numbers.
[02:33:25.881 --> 02:33:29.401]  Please think about supporting our sponsors.
[02:33:29.401 --> 02:33:35.023]  I mean, Rob Dew, I'm having to pay thousands of dollars to get his court case dismissed in Pittsburgh.
[02:33:35.023 --> 02:33:45.625]  Even though he was peacefully there videotaping, they let the mainstream TV stations out of the cordon and arrested him and then charged him with a bunch of crimes and put the wrong date on it and the wrong place.
[02:33:46.519 --> 02:33:48.180]  On the other side of the city.
[02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:52.243]  And I'm not whining, I just... We need your support.
[02:33:52.243 --> 02:33:55.986]  That's why I have produced... I don't have a copy of it in front of me.
[02:33:55.986 --> 02:33:59.249]  Oh, here's one.
[02:33:59.249 --> 02:34:02.852]  That's why I have produced Fall of the Republic.
[02:34:02.852 --> 02:34:04.533]  And here's the new cover for the second printing.
[02:34:05.779 --> 02:34:18.191]  This is the film exposing who the globalists are, how they're criminal, how they engineered the banking collapse, the different operations they're engaged in, how they're planning to bring in the global carbon tax, the gun control, the open borders.
[02:34:18.191 --> 02:34:20.634]  I mean, this film is incredible.
[02:34:20.634 --> 02:34:23.457]  We have an illegitimate criminal government.
[02:34:23.457 --> 02:34:27.621]  We must get the word out about this or we're going to go into deeper and deeper tyranny.
[02:34:29.770 --> 02:34:37.242]  And I cannot stress enough how important Fall of the Republic is, and how when you purchase it, you also support future filmmaking and what we're doing here.
[02:34:37.242 --> 02:34:40.387]  Now look, it's the holidays, it's Christmas.
[02:34:42.079 --> 02:34:45.180]  We've got discounts where you can get Aaron Russo.
[02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:48.180]  This is a film I just released, what, six, seven months ago.
[02:34:48.180 --> 02:34:56.702]  The last interview he did before he died, last video interview, and the extras are the last radio interviews he did with me, where he laid down what Nick Rockefeller told him, everything.
[02:34:56.702 --> 02:35:01.643]  The IRS, the Federal Reserve, it's all exposed in Reflections and Warning.
[02:35:01.643 --> 02:35:06.144]  You can get this free with a whole bunch of different combo deals we have at InfoWars.com.
[02:35:06.144 --> 02:35:09.065]  You can get it free with Fall of the Republic, free with Endgame,
[02:35:09.845 --> 02:35:11.266]  Free with the Obama Deception.
[02:35:11.266 --> 02:35:16.030]  We've got a bunch of different combo deals at Infowars.com.
[02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:23.676]  You can also see Reflections and Warnings and Follow the Republic and the David Icke hour-long interview exclusive we did.
[02:35:23.676 --> 02:35:26.118]  Five and a half years of media.
[02:35:26.118 --> 02:35:30.601]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my films at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:30.601 --> 02:35:37.927]  And we're running a special that we run every year in November and December where you get five months free
[02:35:39.867 --> 02:35:42.169]  It's five plus, it comes up to five and a half months.
[02:35:42.169 --> 02:35:47.813]  Normally, you know, you already get a discount when you get a yearly membership instead of a monthly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:47.813 --> 02:35:50.235]  It's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[02:35:50.235 --> 02:35:58.222]  It comes down to like, I don't have the numbers in front of me, three and a half bucks a month, or close to half off.
[02:35:58.222 --> 02:36:02.145]  When you, that's just a special I came up with four years ago.
[02:36:02.145 --> 02:36:04.386]  We used to have the same special, same price.
[02:36:04.386 --> 02:36:05.687]  It only happens this time of year.
[02:36:06.610 --> 02:36:09.311]  If you are a member, it's time to resubscribe for the year.
[02:36:09.311 --> 02:36:12.613]  If you're not a member, you want to do a trial, it's $5.95.
[02:36:12.613 --> 02:36:15.614]  That pays for the bandwidth, the equipment, the crew.
[02:36:15.614 --> 02:36:18.316]  I got three people out there running this TV show, and I'm not complaining.
[02:36:18.316 --> 02:36:24.899]  I'm saying if you believe in what we're doing, and you believe in the mission we're carrying out, and you believe in what we've got hanging over the edge here,
[02:36:25.814 --> 02:36:28.735]  Then please become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[02:36:28.735 --> 02:36:33.917]  Either a trial monthly or go get a yearly and get five and a half months free right now.
[02:36:33.917 --> 02:36:37.058]  So you pay for six and a half months, you get five and a half months free.
[02:36:37.058 --> 02:36:39.239]  It's like $34, $35 for a year.
[02:36:39.239 --> 02:36:41.440]  Normally it's $59.95.
[02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:49.123]  Point is, ladies and gentlemen, is that it's all available at PrisonPlanet.tv and peruse the huge shopping cart.
[02:36:49.123 --> 02:36:52.444]  T-shirts, books, movies, the best films I see.
[02:36:52.444 --> 02:36:53.625]  Great T-shirt designs.
[02:36:55.606 --> 02:36:58.509]  We have a little bit of the Obama Joker shirts.
[02:36:58.509 --> 02:37:03.754]  I pulled them off for a while while I was assessing how many we had left so that we didn't have to reprint any.
[02:37:03.754 --> 02:37:04.835]  When these are gone, they're gone.
[02:37:04.835 --> 02:37:06.677]  They're going back up in the next few days.
[02:37:06.677 --> 02:37:10.601]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:37:10.601 --> 02:37:10.641]  888-253-3139.
[02:37:16.286 --> 02:37:23.510]  We're not funded by David Rockefeller or George Soros or Al Gore or the federal government, like all the mainstream TV networks are putting out their propaganda now admitting it.
[02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:27.973]  Totally illegal according to the Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office.
[02:37:27.973 --> 02:37:29.294]  They have rulings that it's illegal.
[02:37:29.294 --> 02:37:30.414]  In fact, people don't believe that.
[02:37:30.414 --> 02:37:40.060]  Google, General Accounting Office rules that White House paid press releases are illegal.
[02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:42.001]  That's what they call them, video press releases.
[02:37:46.277 --> 02:37:52.188]  General Accounting Office rules, White House purchasing, news illegal.
[02:37:52.188 --> 02:37:52.969]  Try that.
[02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:54.031]  And that was back during Bush.
[02:37:54.031 --> 02:37:55.273]  It's many times worse now.
[02:37:55.273 --> 02:37:56.676]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:37:56.676 --> 02:37:58.138]  We aren't funded by that.
[02:37:59.295 --> 02:38:04.020]  We're funded by our sponsors, by the products I sell, by your donations, and see it as a donation.
[02:38:04.020 --> 02:38:07.883]  I mean, you're giving to the cause when you get the books and videos and materials.
[02:38:07.883 --> 02:38:08.124]  So, 888-253-3139.
[02:38:08.124 --> 02:38:10.005]  You can also write to me, Alex Jones, InfoWars, at P.O.
[02:38:10.005 --> 02:38:10.146]  Box 19549.
[02:38:10.146 --> 02:38:10.866]  That's P.O.
[02:38:10.866 --> 02:38:11.467]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[02:38:25.427 --> 02:38:27.068]  And we try to have some reserves here.
[02:38:27.068 --> 02:38:29.330]  We try to be good stewards of the support.
[02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:33.554]  We try to be set up to withstand legal attacks, anything else that ever comes.
[02:38:33.554 --> 02:38:35.356]  Knock on wood, they haven't.
[02:38:35.356 --> 02:38:44.223]  Except for having to get our guys out of jail when they try to go shoot video for you, for us.
[02:38:44.223 --> 02:38:49.588]  I wish I wouldn't have woken up at 2.15 last night and couldn't sleep.
[02:38:49.588 --> 02:38:50.789]  I'm starting to run out of gas here.
[02:38:52.065 --> 02:38:54.646]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls and continue with news.
[02:38:54.646 --> 02:38:57.267]  In fact, I'm just going to hurriedly go through the stack of news in a moment.
[02:38:57.267 --> 02:38:59.527]  I wanted to thank one other group of sponsors.
[02:38:59.527 --> 02:39:02.288]  Survivalseedbank.com, wonderful folks.
[02:39:02.288 --> 02:39:08.950]  In a real crisis, having a non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones.
[02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:13.551]  There have been times in American history, Pilgrim for example, when seeds are the highest value of any barter item.
[02:39:13.551 --> 02:39:18.573]  There's a war on against non-hybrid seeds, waged by the global elite, wanting to control us by controlling the food supply.
[02:39:19.153 --> 02:39:20.293]  Governments are storing seeds.
[02:39:20.293 --> 02:39:20.633]  The U.N.
[02:39:20.633 --> 02:39:21.273]  is storing seeds.
[02:39:21.273 --> 02:39:23.754]  Globals have every stripe of storing seeds under the Arctic Circle.
[02:39:23.754 --> 02:39:25.834]  That's admitted.
[02:39:25.834 --> 02:39:26.875]  Why do you think this is?
[02:39:26.875 --> 02:39:27.415]  You know why.
[02:39:27.415 --> 02:39:28.415]  Control.
[02:39:28.415 --> 02:39:32.476]  Solutions from Science is trying to get the seeds out of the globalist's hands, into the hands of the people.
[02:39:32.476 --> 02:39:33.436]  One seed bank at a time.
[02:39:33.436 --> 02:39:34.776]  One family at a time.
[02:39:34.776 --> 02:39:36.236]  Go to survivalseedbank.com.

[02:39:48.314 --> 02:39:52.358]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is DigiNet Personal Audio Video Recording Systems.
[02:39:52.358 --> 02:39:58.645]  They have sunglasses with a tiny hidden audio video camera with a little chip in it that records hours of video.
[02:39:58.645 --> 02:40:03.330]  Great to protect yourself from the police and the government and the media and the lying big brother system.
[02:40:03.330 --> 02:40:04.592]  Fight fire with fire.
[02:40:04.592 --> 02:40:07.975]  They're running a special for the In the Fed rally on November 22nd nationwide.

[02:40:12.103 --> 02:40:14.663]  You hit one button, it shoots video and audio.

[02:40:24.746 --> 02:40:25.806]  Their toll-free number is 888-344-6681.
[02:40:25.806 --> 02:40:25.866]  888-344-6681.
[02:40:25.866 --> 02:40:26.227]  Diginet.net.
[02:40:26.227 --> 02:40:28.807]  And also support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[02:40:39.286 --> 02:40:40.506]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:41:07.532 --> 02:41:16.315]  As I was traveling in here, I commute from Pennsylvania down to Maryland, down the corridor there, I-270.
[02:41:16.315 --> 02:41:29.919]  And I've been traveling this for probably 20-something years, but I've noticed over the years, especially just this past year since Obama got in, they've been doing all these bridge work and road work.
[02:41:29.919 --> 02:41:33.040]  Yeah, that's part of the economic stimulus package.
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:35.621]  It's a payoff to the local constabulary, but it was also needed.
[02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:42.704]  Yeah, well... For every $30 given to the banks, $1 was given to infrastructure, but at least something happened.
[02:41:42.704 --> 02:41:46.207]  At least a blind hog does find an acorn occasionally.
[02:41:46.207 --> 02:41:47.808]  This sign jumped out at me this morning.
[02:41:47.808 --> 02:41:49.269]  I've seen these things going in.
[02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:51.570]  They're near a truckway station.
[02:41:51.570 --> 02:41:55.533]  And it always tells you, look for terrorists, look for an old lady who's lost?
[02:41:55.533 --> 02:41:55.893]  Right.
[02:41:55.893 --> 02:41:59.155]  It says, electronic screening site.
[02:41:59.155 --> 02:42:02.658]  They put these things up over the road, and I thought they were cameras at first.
[02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:10.115]  But, um, I believe they're more of a RFID type reader.
[02:42:10.115 --> 02:42:16.700]  Yeah, no, they're reading trucks, GPS, and their barcode, transponders, transceivers.
[02:42:16.700 --> 02:42:20.843]  They're also, different systems are reading your license plate.
[02:42:20.843 --> 02:42:21.583]  Right.
[02:42:21.583 --> 02:42:27.888]  But it seems like the improvements that they're doing on the highway, it's more like a cattle chute.
[02:42:27.888 --> 02:42:28.428]  There is no...
[02:42:31.678 --> 02:42:34.799]  Lockdown could become lockdown very easily.
[02:42:34.799 --> 02:42:41.561]  Oh, all over the country they're putting cable barriers up on I-37, going to Corpus Christi, everywhere.
[02:42:41.561 --> 02:42:42.961]  And they admit it's to control us.
[02:42:42.961 --> 02:42:43.742]  No.
[02:42:43.742 --> 02:42:49.083]  What would a criminal group do that seized the banking system and the government and was robbing everyone?
[02:42:49.083 --> 02:42:51.224]  They would put in a police state to protect themselves.
[02:42:51.224 --> 02:42:53.025]  That's all this is.
[02:42:53.025 --> 02:42:53.785]  Right.
[02:42:53.785 --> 02:42:54.325]  Exactly.
[02:42:55.097 --> 02:43:00.278]  Exactly, and you're nailing it right on the head with the control grid.
[02:43:00.278 --> 02:43:01.879]  That's just part of it.
[02:43:01.879 --> 02:43:12.202]  So that's what prompted my call, but the pastor was on a while ago talking to you, and I was looking, right when he got on there, I was looking at the same verse, Ezekiel 33, 6.
[02:43:12.202 --> 02:43:16.623]  It says about you being the watchman, you know, I consider you a watchman.
[02:43:17.290 --> 02:43:32.343]  But if the watchman sees a sword come and blown off the trumpet, and the people will be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them, he is taken away and has inequity, but the blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
[02:43:32.343 --> 02:43:39.269]  I believe your hands are clean, Alex, you know, and I wholeheartedly support what you're doing.
[02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:42.111]  Just keep it up.
[02:43:42.111 --> 02:43:43.152]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:43:43.152 --> 02:43:43.693]  God bless you.
[02:43:45.396 --> 02:43:49.818]  Yeah, I didn't know what I was getting into 16 years ago, 14 years ago on air.
[02:43:49.818 --> 02:43:54.819]  I mean, I knew there were big banks and they were corrupt and there was a new world order, but it was still off in the distance.
[02:43:54.819 --> 02:44:00.922]  And, you know, I did original research and read a lot of other people's good original research.
[02:44:00.922 --> 02:44:06.624]  But then in the late 90s, it started coming out in mainstream news that the UN runs giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:44:06.624 --> 02:44:07.504]  And I was like, what?
[02:44:08.848 --> 02:44:18.330]  And then I saw congressional hearings in 2002 where they admitted DynCorp does this and they don't get in trouble and Rumsfeld said they're allowed to and laughed about it.
[02:44:18.330 --> 02:44:20.070]  It's like they're crushing us with evil.
[02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:21.271]  They're flaunting it.
[02:44:21.271 --> 02:44:29.832]  Those of us in the know, they're terrorizing us and everybody else, they're just searing their conscience where we're trained to put up with anything.
[02:44:29.832 --> 02:44:35.174]  And then all the other stuff they do and the globalists, you talk to them, you're like, well, there is population reduction going on.
[02:44:35.174 --> 02:44:36.614]  They go, well, what are you going to do for the earth?
[02:44:40.211 --> 02:44:54.204]  And it's creepy to know they're on my tail and coming at me from every angle.
[02:44:54.204 --> 02:44:57.748]  But it's really creepy to know I can be taken out of the game.
[02:44:57.748 --> 02:44:58.188]  That's all.
[02:44:58.188 --> 02:44:58.969]  I want to stay in the game.
[02:45:00.376 --> 02:45:02.138]  I want to get better.
[02:45:02.138 --> 02:45:04.240]  I want to be a better radio host.
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:05.901]  I want to tell the truth.
[02:45:05.901 --> 02:45:07.062]  I want to be more accurate.
[02:45:07.062 --> 02:45:09.725]  I want to make sure I cover all the angles for people.
[02:45:09.725 --> 02:45:11.486]  I want to be a good father.
[02:45:11.486 --> 02:45:12.647]  I want to be a good husband.
[02:45:12.647 --> 02:45:14.989]  I want to be good to my crew.
[02:45:14.989 --> 02:45:19.434]  I want to, at the same time, enjoy life and be able to see things.
[02:45:19.434 --> 02:45:21.856]  I have a wanderlust, but I can't enjoy that.
[02:45:24.476 --> 02:45:25.356]  I'm not complaining.
[02:45:25.356 --> 02:45:29.439]  It's just we've all been robbed of our innocence.
[02:45:29.439 --> 02:45:30.820]  We've been robbed of our time.
[02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:33.482]  We've been robbed of our future.
[02:45:33.482 --> 02:45:36.043]  And I don't even hate my enemy anymore.
[02:45:36.043 --> 02:45:40.627]  I realize that 99% of the people carrying out this new world order are just ignorant.
[02:45:40.627 --> 02:45:41.767]  They're under mind control.
[02:45:41.767 --> 02:45:43.068]  There's no other word for it.
[02:45:43.068 --> 02:45:43.889]  They're under a spell.
[02:45:45.330 --> 02:45:47.051]  And I'm more horrified for them.
[02:45:47.051 --> 02:45:56.457]  I never understood reading the Bible where Jesus is saying, forgive them, Father, they know not what they do, and other apostles after him actually feeling sorry for those that were persecuting them.
[02:45:56.457 --> 02:46:00.519]  But they were understanding these people are given over to pure evil.
[02:46:00.519 --> 02:46:01.240]  They're destroyed.
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:02.320]  They're losing their soul.
[02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:05.102]  They're losing their humanity.
[02:46:05.102 --> 02:46:09.004]  And I don't want to hate the BATF for bombing Oklahoma City.
[02:46:09.004 --> 02:46:13.167]  I don't want to hate all these people.
[02:46:15.658 --> 02:46:21.279]  Especially their dumb minions that don't know what they're part of, or some young power-tripping cop who's brainwashed.
[02:46:21.279 --> 02:46:25.080]  I just... I wish they could be good.
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:27.341]  I wish they could know what I know.
[02:46:27.341 --> 02:46:29.481]  I wish I could take them to the places I've been.
[02:46:29.481 --> 02:46:33.302]  I wish they could see with my eyes what I've seen.
[02:46:33.302 --> 02:46:35.003]  And I know they've seen a lot of things I haven't seen.
[02:46:35.003 --> 02:46:35.243]  I'm not...
[02:46:41.308 --> 02:47:06.949]  You know, in the past, I've hated people that have attacked me in government and in media and in my own genre, as they call it, but also, and now I've lost that with greater discernment, and I'm more focused, I'm more peaceful, but in that quietness, I have such greater understanding, and in a way, I miss the flesh, and I still have a lot of flesh in me.
[02:47:06.949 --> 02:47:08.330]  I still have a lot of worldliness in me.
[02:47:09.451 --> 02:47:14.390]  But it's much weaker than it was a long time ago.
[02:47:14.390 --> 02:47:14.952]  And I almost...
[02:47:16.278 --> 02:47:19.840]  Miss hating my enemies and miss that because it was a distraction.
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:30.785]  It was a worldly distraction, kind of a tunnel vision to distract me from the larger mission I'm on so that I wouldn't have to just constantly sit here with the information just seething through me.
[02:47:30.785 --> 02:47:33.506]  And I mean, I don't even want to, most days I don't cover the news.
[02:47:33.506 --> 02:47:37.908]  I do all the research and don't even cover most of it because I don't want to cover this.
[02:47:37.908 --> 02:47:43.230]  I don't want to focus and have the thoughts again I had earlier and the understanding and all the info.
[02:47:43.230 --> 02:47:44.111]  I mean, I'm like, ah,
[02:47:46.292 --> 02:48:00.325]  I guess I'm kind of like a cop or something that is a detective and has done a couple hundred murder investigations and at a certain point, I don't want to see dead families and blood and death and torture chambers and that's what I see, that's what I do!
[02:48:00.325 --> 02:48:06.711]  And I have to watch the murderers in fancy $5,000 suits traipsing around destroying my country?
[02:48:06.711 --> 02:48:07.953]  Destroying our whole future?
[02:48:14.488 --> 02:48:17.449]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[02:48:17.449 --> 02:48:20.309]  And I can't stop, I can't give up.
[02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:23.590]  Even if I was a coward and wanted to give up, it's not in me.
[02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:24.971]  I can't do it.
[02:48:24.971 --> 02:48:28.332]  And if I give up, they'll come after me even more.
[02:48:28.332 --> 02:48:31.752]  I have to continue.
[02:48:31.752 --> 02:48:32.973]  We all have to continue.
[02:48:32.973 --> 02:48:34.993]  We're not getting out of this, folks.
[02:48:34.993 --> 02:48:35.973]  We're going through it.
[02:48:35.973 --> 02:48:36.514]  You understand?
[02:48:36.514 --> 02:48:37.774]  You're not backing out of this.
[02:48:38.988 --> 02:48:42.209]  We passed the point of no return into world government a long time ago.
[02:48:42.209 --> 02:48:42.910]  And that's the thing.
[02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:45.911]  I realize a lot of you don't know what you're in.
[02:48:45.911 --> 02:48:47.752]  I'm not talking about those of you that have been fighting this.
[02:48:47.752 --> 02:48:48.712]  You're in it too.
[02:48:48.712 --> 02:48:49.752]  But at least you know.
[02:48:49.752 --> 02:48:55.595]  It's like walking around a field at night with big 50-foot pits in it with spikes in the bottom.
[02:48:55.595 --> 02:48:57.415]  And I'm a guy saying, you better have a flashlight.
[02:48:57.415 --> 02:48:58.996]  You better be careful out in that field, man.
[02:48:58.996 --> 02:49:00.257]  There's some bad stuff.
[02:49:00.257 --> 02:49:02.417]  Look at history.
[02:49:02.417 --> 02:49:03.838]  I've fallen into those pits.
[02:49:03.838 --> 02:49:05.859]  I've seen a lot of other people fall into those pits.
[02:49:05.859 --> 02:49:07.079]  You better listen to me.
[02:49:07.079 --> 02:49:07.900]  This isn't a game.
[02:49:09.246 --> 02:49:12.229]  And I watch people laugh at me and go stumble off the cliff.
[02:49:12.229 --> 02:49:19.475]  And I go, did you just see him fall into that pit?
[02:49:19.475 --> 02:49:25.039]  And I don't want the FBI and the military and the police and the bureaucrats and the corporate people
[02:49:26.041 --> 02:49:27.341]  to go along with this.
[02:49:27.341 --> 02:49:28.982]  I don't want to see them lost.
[02:49:28.982 --> 02:49:30.922]  I don't want to see them serve it.
[02:49:30.922 --> 02:49:33.663]  They think, a lot of them, at a primitive level, they're tough guys.
[02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:35.523]  That's how the world really works.
[02:49:35.523 --> 02:49:37.164]  You're just weak and can't understand it.
[02:49:37.164 --> 02:49:43.365]  We're making the tough decisions and you just can't get your mind wrapped around that.
[02:49:43.365 --> 02:49:47.226]  Yeah, we're evil, but we're the evil that's protecting you.
[02:49:47.226 --> 02:49:50.286]  We've got to be evil to defeat the real evil.
[02:49:50.286 --> 02:49:51.647]  That's the system, the lie.
[02:49:53.888 --> 02:50:07.690]  The mindset that's sold by them, that these merchants of death and merchants of lies and fraud and deceit push.
[02:50:07.690 --> 02:50:14.571]  And I was never an evil person, but I could go there in my mind when I was young.
[02:50:14.571 --> 02:50:17.292]  I could see the beauty of evil.
[02:50:17.292 --> 02:50:23.093]  On the surface it can look sexy and powerful, but then I really
[02:50:24.867 --> 02:50:32.454]  Stuck my head into it and went whoa and pulled back and it strengthened my humanity by pulling out of it.
[02:50:32.454 --> 02:50:43.024]  And there's those of you out there that think you're winning and think you have this power and think that you're out there just slaughtering and enslaving and abusing and you don't think of us as human.
[02:50:43.024 --> 02:50:49.471]  There are people above you in levels far more wicked than you can imagine and I have
[02:50:50.715 --> 02:50:51.897]  Learned their mind.
[02:50:51.897 --> 02:50:54.119]  I have seen through their eyes.
[02:50:54.119 --> 02:50:55.841]  And let me tell you something.
[02:50:55.841 --> 02:50:59.806]  You better turn around right now and realize there is no turning around.
[02:50:59.806 --> 02:51:00.707]  We gotta go through this.

[02:52:02.865 --> 02:52:06.872]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.872 --> 02:52:10.137]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.137 --> 02:52:11.540]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:12.245 --> 02:52:14.908]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.908 --> 02:52:21.313]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.313 --> 02:52:26.478]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.478 --> 02:52:36.487]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.607 --> 02:52:38.948]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.948 --> 02:52:40.528]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.528 --> 02:52:42.988]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.988 --> 02:52:45.109]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.109 --> 02:52:50.270]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:50.270 --> 02:53:01.432]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:53:01.432 --> 02:53:04.033]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to
[02:53:05.728 --> 02:53:06.129]  I think so.
[02:53:20.748 --> 02:53:20.988]  I think so.

[02:53:55.217 --> 02:53:57.599]  No one knows what it's like to be the bad man.
[02:53:57.599 --> 02:53:58.239]  To be the sad man.
[02:53:58.239 --> 02:53:59.060]  Behind blue eyes,
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:31.272]  No one knows what it's like to be hated, to be fated, to telling only lies.
[02:54:31.272 --> 02:54:42.722]  But my dreams, they aren't as empty as my conscience seems.
[02:54:43.277 --> 02:54:47.899]  Jerry in Arkansas, you're on the air.
[02:54:47.899 --> 02:54:51.621]  Thanks for holding.
[02:54:51.621 --> 02:54:52.061]  Welcome.
[02:54:52.061 --> 02:54:55.303]  Hey Alex.
[02:54:55.303 --> 02:54:55.863]  Hey buddy.
[02:55:07.372 --> 02:55:08.813]  It's nice to speak to you again.
[02:55:08.813 --> 02:55:13.995]  I want to commend you on being one of the few last credible sources of information out there.
[02:55:13.995 --> 02:55:26.819]  But I called to touch on the point that you said earlier about how the Bible is being changed and how this is really and truly a spiritual battle, although most of us only see the secular side.
[02:55:26.819 --> 02:55:35.082]  And I wanted to read something to the listeners out there real quick who think that Jesus was always a pacifist and believed in letting evil trample over him.
[02:55:36.792 --> 02:55:47.458]  My Lord said this, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his script.
[02:55:47.458 --> 02:55:53.882]  And he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.
[02:55:53.882 --> 02:56:01.447]  He said that these things were going to be necessary for the transgressions that were coming concerning him at the end of time.
[02:56:03.573 --> 02:56:11.661]  We are in a very deep spiritual battle with these people who you talk about every day, who are the sons of Satan.
[02:56:11.661 --> 02:56:22.852]  And many of us are going to lose our bodies in this battle and our lives in this battle, but you won't lose your soul.
[02:56:22.852 --> 02:56:25.895]  And you have to understand that we are spiritual beings caught
[02:56:27.685 --> 02:56:30.546]  In a paradox of space and time.
[02:56:30.546 --> 02:56:33.308]  And for anybody that doesn't know that, they have no discernment.
[02:56:33.308 --> 02:56:36.089]  We're on a planet in deep space.
[02:56:36.089 --> 02:56:46.194]  I've got the top CERN scientist in mainstream news saying they're about to open an interdimensional gate.
[02:56:46.194 --> 02:56:54.498]  The beings who run this world that serve their god, Satan, they have illuminated knowledge that they have not shared
[02:56:55.410 --> 02:56:59.071]  With the rest of humanity, and they use... That's the big lie!
[02:56:59.071 --> 02:57:02.912]  They know if the public knew the truth, they'd instantly repent!
[02:57:02.912 --> 02:57:04.012]  Absolutely.
[02:57:04.012 --> 02:57:04.592]  They know!
[02:57:04.592 --> 02:57:06.412]  That's the thing about the truly evil ones.
[02:57:06.412 --> 02:57:08.153]  They know all this!
[02:57:08.153 --> 02:57:09.933]  Kill, steal, and destroy!
[02:57:09.933 --> 02:57:11.693]  What does eco-science say?
[02:57:11.693 --> 02:57:12.794]  Kill us!
[02:57:12.794 --> 02:57:17.655]  Their religion was killing us 3,000 years ago, and it is today!
[02:57:17.655 --> 02:57:23.716]  You're absolutely right, and we are so close to the end times, and the great prophet Daniel
[02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:32.776]  I said that at the end times Babylon, which is the system we live under, not the place over there in Persia that we now call Iraq.
[02:57:32.776 --> 02:57:37.319]  Babylon, which is the system, would speak with the voice of the lion.
[02:57:37.319 --> 02:57:39.080]  You can look this up yourself.
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:46.585]  Now what that means is the lion was a symbology for England, so in the end times the world is going to speak English.
[02:57:46.585 --> 02:57:51.689]  The other night on CBS News they were playing a little story about the
[02:57:52.244 --> 02:57:54.325]  It is, in the world, it is the global imperial language.
[02:58:14.172 --> 02:58:24.920]  Absolutely, because they're preparing us for this new Babylon, this new one-world system, one-world order in which they bring the chaos and then they bring the solutions.
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:28.602]  And that is the mission statement of the 33rd level, you know that.
[02:58:28.602 --> 02:58:35.367]  You tell people that every day, Alex, of the Masons, who are one of the inner sects of this.
[02:58:35.367 --> 02:58:37.729]  Jerry, great points, but we're out of time.
[02:58:37.729 --> 02:58:39.811]  Back with the final hour in 70 seconds.
[02:58:39.811 --> 02:58:41.552]  Warrior Calls, Webster Tarpon.
[02:58:42.742 --> 02:58:46.015]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.015 --> 02:58:48.224]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:50.848 --> 02:58:55.391]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:55.391 --> 02:58:56.311]  Number one.
[02:58:56.311 --> 02:58:59.734]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:59.734 --> 02:59:00.594]  Number two.
[02:59:00.594 --> 02:59:05.477]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:05.477 --> 02:59:06.238]  It's true.
[02:59:06.238 --> 02:59:11.101]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:11.101 --> 02:59:11.921]  Number three.
[02:59:11.921 --> 02:59:15.504]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:15.504 --> 02:59:19.206]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:19.406 --> 02:59:20.207]  Number 4.
[02:59:20.207 --> 02:59:22.969]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:22.969 --> 02:59:26.652]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:26.652 --> 02:59:27.433]  Number 5.
[02:59:27.433 --> 02:59:31.597]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:31.597 --> 02:59:36.361]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:36.641 --> 02:59:40.803]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.803 --> 02:59:42.583]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:42.583 --> 02:59:44.844]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:44.844 --> 02:59:47.205]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:00:06.437 --> 03:00:08.699]  We are already into hour number four.
[03:00:08.699 --> 03:00:15.104]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls and Webster Tarpley will be with us for about 30 minutes.
[03:00:15.104 --> 03:00:17.186]  By the way, I forgot to print it.
[03:00:17.186 --> 03:00:19.828]  Will you print me the headline?
[03:00:19.828 --> 03:00:21.529]  Because that's when I have the article they wrote.
[03:00:21.529 --> 03:00:24.371]  It's detailed, huge bibliography.
[03:00:24.371 --> 03:00:29.696]  Was Fort Hood shooter Patsy Indrill?
[03:00:29.696 --> 03:00:31.097]  That's close to the headline.
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:34.902]  Was Fort Hood Patsy?
[03:00:34.902 --> 03:00:37.064]  Was Fort Hood Shooter a Patsy and Brill?
[03:00:37.064 --> 03:00:38.805]  I need that for Webster coming up.
[03:00:38.805 --> 03:00:40.527]  Then I'm going to play a clip from the Watchmen.
[03:00:40.527 --> 03:00:42.789]  I'll just talk about Watchmen today.
[03:00:42.789 --> 03:00:44.670]  The New World Order has its Watchmen.
[03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:46.612]  This is deep Illuminati teaching.
[03:00:46.612 --> 03:00:51.116]  We're going to play this on air and expose these bastards for what they are.
[03:00:51.116 --> 03:00:55.100]  Let's go ahead and go back to the phone calls.
[03:00:55.100 --> 03:00:57.322]  Let's talk to Gabe in New York.
[03:00:57.322 --> 03:00:58.923]  Gabe in New York, you're on the air.
[03:00:58.923 --> 03:00:59.524]  Thank you for holding.
[03:01:00.663 --> 03:01:03.585]  Hi Alex Jones, Gabriel.
[03:01:03.585 --> 03:01:06.268]  I sent you those photos on the caller from last week.
[03:01:06.268 --> 03:01:12.553]  I sent those photos to Aaron at InfoWars with the troops with the .30 caliber machine guns on Jones Beach.
[03:01:12.553 --> 03:01:14.494]  They're basically walking around the boardwalk.
[03:01:14.494 --> 03:01:16.256]  The photos are very self-explanatory.
[03:01:16.256 --> 03:01:19.138]  What is the title of your article and what address did you send it to?
[03:01:19.138 --> 03:01:21.019]  I want to pull them and get them to curtain them.
[03:01:21.019 --> 03:01:24.402]  I sent it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[03:01:24.402 --> 03:01:25.243]  And what's the title?
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:31.924]  Um, it's, I think, uh, Jones Beach, um, military .30 caliber machine gun.
[03:01:31.924 --> 03:01:34.246]  Okay, guys, can I have a pen?
[03:01:34.246 --> 03:01:37.409]  My, my, my, my pen's just, oh, here's one that's on the floor.
[03:01:37.409 --> 03:01:40.051]  Okay, so the title's Jones Beach .30 Cal.
[03:01:40.051 --> 03:01:43.453]  Yeah, it talks about, it's pretty self-explained in the photos.
[03:01:43.453 --> 03:01:48.677]  I also had a couple other points I wanted to get across that I think are important.
[03:01:48.677 --> 03:01:50.539]  Um, here's what the New World Order is.
[03:01:50.539 --> 03:01:54.402]  It's, if you understand the system, people, the new listeners on the show,
[03:01:55.149 --> 03:01:59.451]  It's a combination of risk, monopoly, and chess.
[03:01:59.451 --> 03:02:04.032]  You combine those three principles, those three games, and you'll understand what the system is.
[03:02:04.032 --> 03:02:10.575]  The individuals, however, to understand them, you have to understand history, patterns, and psychology.
[03:02:10.575 --> 03:02:12.576]  And what is their psychology?
[03:02:12.576 --> 03:02:24.240]  Their psychology is being sociopaths, highly paranoid psychopaths, addictive personalities, obsessive-compulsive, hyper-competitive, calculated,
[03:02:24.881 --> 03:02:28.124]  Control freaks, and in some cases, pedophiles.
[03:02:28.124 --> 03:02:30.807]  I've seen that, and they believe in that.
[03:02:30.807 --> 03:02:39.095]  Well, yeah, they use criminal guilds and secret criminal guilds of compromised people, and pedophiles are one.
[03:02:39.095 --> 03:02:42.599]  That's always been that way with Satanists and people throughout history.
[03:02:42.599 --> 03:02:48.404]  Even before they called it Satanism, it was all about sacrificing children because the state and the priest class
[03:02:49.085 --> 03:02:51.466]  Demands our most pure and innocent.
[03:02:51.466 --> 03:02:53.027]  It's a war against innocence.
[03:02:53.027 --> 03:02:57.230]  But yes, the pedophile guilds are very near the top of the pyramid.
[03:02:57.230 --> 03:02:58.010]  That's what they believe.
[03:02:58.010 --> 03:03:01.833]  They also believe in this idea called, if I can't have it, no one can.
[03:03:01.833 --> 03:03:04.114]  In other words, they'll destroy the world.
[03:03:04.114 --> 03:03:06.695]  All of their philosophy, I had that in game.
[03:03:06.695 --> 03:03:12.199]  All these top transhumanists say, if we can't control the world, we will destroy it.
[03:03:12.199 --> 03:03:13.499]  Lennon wrote that.
[03:03:13.499 --> 03:03:15.801]  You really know your stuff, Gabe.
[03:03:16.257 --> 03:03:16.657]  Here's the thing.
[03:03:16.657 --> 03:03:17.398]  Here's their game.
[03:03:17.398 --> 03:03:18.640]  You want to understand their game?
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:22.845]  Their game is an aristocratic game where people are mere playthings.
[03:03:22.845 --> 03:03:26.068]  Remember the American Revolutionary War with the battlefields?
[03:03:26.068 --> 03:03:30.674]  That looked like a big board game, how the troops would be lined up shooting each other.
[03:03:31.201 --> 03:03:32.221]  And why did they do that?
[03:03:32.221 --> 03:03:34.442]  Because they wanted to be gentlemanly-like.
[03:03:34.442 --> 03:03:37.044]  And we have to remember what their ideas come from.
[03:03:37.044 --> 03:03:38.664]  They come from British royalty.
[03:03:38.664 --> 03:03:46.848]  Remember David Gergen, White House advisor to four administrations, got in my face and said, you sneaking into Bohemian Grove wasn't very gentlemanly!
[03:03:47.557 --> 03:03:49.098]  My friend loved that clip.
[03:03:49.098 --> 03:03:51.478]  He said that was the best thing he ever saw in his life.
[03:03:51.478 --> 03:03:55.860]  And as far as these people are going, you gotta remember what the elite are like.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:59.161]  They're basically of British royalty and they believe in being very polite.
[03:03:59.161 --> 03:04:03.663]  They're basically a bunch of decadent, sickening, hyper-intelligent control freaks.
[03:04:03.663 --> 03:04:06.344]  And I don't like what they're doing to me and my family and other people.
[03:04:06.344 --> 03:04:10.205]  And I don't like them going after innocent people and I'm sick of their garbage.
[03:04:10.205 --> 03:04:12.666]  That's why they're openly honest about what they're doing.
[03:04:12.666 --> 03:04:16.608]  They want us to know what they're doing so they can justify everything they're doing.
[03:04:17.933 --> 03:04:29.241]  And then they say, they say, exactly, we admit what we're doing, but then we lie about it, because if you're profane and deserve to be destroyed, then we admit it to you, but then deny it.
[03:04:29.241 --> 03:04:32.884]  It's a mind game to say, well, we told you we're going to do this.
[03:04:32.884 --> 03:04:34.965]  Now we're going to launch our PSYOP.
[03:04:34.965 --> 03:04:36.026]  Now we're going to lie to you.
[03:04:36.026 --> 03:04:43.431]  You're absolutely, listen, you should start calling in a few times a week to the new caller line, 512-646-7000.
[03:04:46.574 --> 03:04:47.435]  4444.
[03:04:47.435 --> 03:04:54.507]  You're so good Gabe, and we might play a minute clip of you ranting about something on the news every day, because you absolutely are on target.
[03:04:54.507 --> 03:04:58.213]  You're a fellow after my own mind, and we really appreciate you.
[03:04:58.213 --> 03:04:59.415]  That's a good caller right there.
[03:04:59.415 --> 03:04:59.875]  Stay with us.

[03:06:00.765 --> 03:06:08.513]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[03:06:08.513 --> 03:06:14.599]  You can buy it at here'swhatyoudo.net as an e-book for $6 or the book for $10.

[03:06:33.515 --> 03:06:35.596]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[03:06:35.596 --> 03:06:37.357]  You need to look out for yourself.
[03:06:37.357 --> 03:06:39.878]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[03:06:39.878 --> 03:06:44.601]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[03:06:44.601 --> 03:06:48.323]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[03:06:48.323 --> 03:06:50.465]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[03:06:51.426 --> 03:06:53.334]  That's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:06:53.334 --> 03:06:55.463]  One last time, it's here'swhatyoudo.net.
[03:07:01.681 --> 03:07:05.345]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:07:05.345 --> 03:07:08.949]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:07:08.949 --> 03:07:13.734]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:07:13.734 --> 03:07:20.141]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:07:20.141 --> 03:07:22.384]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:07:22.904 --> 03:07:24.524]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:07:24.524 --> 03:07:25.685]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:07:25.685 --> 03:07:27.925]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:07:41.809 --> 03:07:43.670]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:49.092]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[03:07:49.092 --> 03:08:03.319]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:03.319 --> 03:08:08.902]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:20.133 --> 03:08:23.715]  Well, Webster Griffin Tarpley is an amazing author.
[03:08:23.715 --> 03:08:28.578]  He is a big part of Fall of the Republic, my newest film, and the Obama deception.
[03:08:28.578 --> 03:08:32.221]  He is a doctor of history, a doctor of economics.
[03:08:36.107 --> 03:08:40.070]  We always really respect his analysis and breakdown.
[03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:44.373]  He's an invaluable resource for all of us that want to know the truth and cut through the fog.
[03:08:44.373 --> 03:08:47.476]  In fact, he's had one of the best-selling 9-11 books.
[03:08:47.476 --> 03:08:49.377]  We actually sell it at InfoWars.com.
[03:08:49.377 --> 03:08:52.880]  Only the best, what we offer at InfoWars.com on the online video bookstore.
[03:08:52.880 --> 03:08:56.963]  9-11 Synthetic Terror.
[03:08:56.963 --> 03:09:00.826]  How 9-11 was manufactured with Patsy Dupes molds.
[03:09:01.974 --> 03:09:10.903]  And when you understand the methodology and pattern of why they use drills, why they use moles, why they use Patsy's, this is a lot of this has been declassified.
[03:09:10.903 --> 03:09:12.224]  You can understand it now.
[03:09:12.224 --> 03:09:23.235]  We're two weeks plus into the or almost two weeks into the murders at Fort Hood, Texas.
[03:09:24.423 --> 03:09:29.846]  Major Hassan of Fort Hood, a Patsy and a Drill Gone Live, question mark, is a detailed article.
[03:09:29.846 --> 03:09:35.029]  We appreciate Webster sending it to us for publishing at Infowars.com.
[03:09:35.029 --> 03:09:39.151]  It is a huge article.
[03:09:39.151 --> 03:09:43.193]  More than, what is it, 18, 19 pages?
[03:09:43.193 --> 03:09:47.015]  A huge bibliography, all mainstream news sources.
[03:09:47.015 --> 03:09:52.698]  So with us in this segment, the next, and part of the segment after that, then I'm doing my breakdown of the Watchmen.
[03:09:54.238 --> 03:09:58.559]  Is Webster Griffin Tarpley specifically on this subject?
[03:09:58.559 --> 03:10:00.039]  Webster, it's great to have you on.
[03:10:00.039 --> 03:10:02.160]  Thanks for coming on on short notice.
[03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:04.581]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you for the kind words.
[03:10:04.581 --> 03:10:05.801]  Well, the truth is the truth.
[03:10:05.801 --> 03:10:07.721]  Veritas must be trumpeted.
[03:10:07.721 --> 03:10:11.402]  Webster, I'm going to try to sit back because we don't have a lot of time with you today.
[03:10:11.402 --> 03:10:12.462]  Go through your article.
[03:10:12.462 --> 03:10:13.663]  Break it down.
[03:10:13.663 --> 03:10:14.803]  Maybe first explain.
[03:10:14.803 --> 03:10:21.225]  Well, you know how to explain it, but I would imagine it'd be good if you explained how patsies, dupes, drills are used over and over again.
[03:10:21.225 --> 03:10:22.685]  We see the same fingerprints.
[03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:24.190]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:33.012]  You've already said the most important premise, I guess, which is there's a method to these things, and once you know the method, you can recognize them
[03:10:46.718 --> 03:10:49.180]  I think relatively easily.
[03:10:49.180 --> 03:10:57.565]  False flag terrorism or these kinds of provocations that are dished up by intelligence agencies involve the use of, first of all, the Patsy.
[03:10:57.565 --> 03:11:05.350]  That would be somebody like Lee Harvey Oswald or Mohammed Atta or Cho, the shooter there at Virginia Tech more recently.
[03:11:05.350 --> 03:11:06.370]  Tim McVeigh.
[03:11:06.370 --> 03:11:10.173]  McVeigh, the Bong, Sirhan Sirhan, James Earl Ray.
[03:11:10.173 --> 03:11:11.073]  These are the Patsy's.
[03:11:11.073 --> 03:11:13.435]  These are the fall guys and they're going to be demonized.
[03:11:14.204 --> 03:11:15.967]  They're always screwed up ding-dongs.
[03:11:31.829 --> 03:11:32.389]  And we have that here.
[03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:33.230]  He's saying all these horrible things.
[03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:34.791]  Worshipping suicide bombers.
[03:11:34.791 --> 03:11:35.472]  The FBI, CIA.
[03:11:35.472 --> 03:11:36.212]  He tried to contact Al-Qaeda.
[03:11:36.212 --> 03:11:37.793]  He didn't know he was contacting the CIA.
[03:11:53.186 --> 03:11:57.447]  The soldier of Allah, he wants to get people put on trial for war crimes.
[03:11:57.447 --> 03:11:59.007]  But you have to look deeper.
[03:11:59.007 --> 03:12:02.608]  The mole, inside the government, there's a private network.
[03:12:02.608 --> 03:12:03.848]  It's not a government network.
[03:12:03.848 --> 03:12:05.709]  I call it a Wall Street network.
[03:12:05.709 --> 03:12:06.949]  Call it a rogue network.
[03:12:06.949 --> 03:12:10.069]  It's an Anglo-American intelligence network.
[03:12:10.069 --> 03:12:16.051]  And this has its own separate agenda, and they try to make sure that the Patsy's don't get rounded up.
[03:12:16.051 --> 03:12:22.252]  Until the event occurs, the mole wants to make sure that the Patsy is left free, because otherwise you can't blame him.
[03:12:22.572 --> 03:12:32.038]  So that's evidence one that as usual, like 9-11, like McVeigh, like Sirhan Sirhan, like Lee Harvey Oswald, they always protect the minion.
[03:12:33.435 --> 03:12:39.080]  Until it happens, and then of course they round them up right away, because then they've got to come up with a scapegoat.
[03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:46.867]  And then of course we have the technicians, the people that you don't see, who actually have the physical, technical capability of bringing about the events.
[03:12:46.867 --> 03:12:53.352]  The people who wired the buildings for controlled demolition, or who really did the shooting there in Dealey Plaza in Dallas.
[03:12:54.953 --> 03:12:55.654]  Way back when.
[03:12:55.654 --> 03:12:58.075]  So you've got to look at it from this point of view.
[03:12:58.075 --> 03:13:00.917]  And the other thing that you've said, extremely important, the drills.
[03:13:00.917 --> 03:13:02.297]  Always look for drills.
[03:13:02.297 --> 03:13:13.944]  Anybody talking about a drill, a drill going on at the same time, a drill that looks sort of like what happened, that can indicate that a drill has gone live, been taken live, or been flipped live.
[03:13:13.944 --> 03:13:15.685]  So that's essentially it.
[03:13:15.685 --> 03:13:20.648]  And of course, the brainwashing role of the controlled Wall Street media, always an important thing.
[03:13:20.648 --> 03:13:21.569]  So I start with this.
[03:13:22.109 --> 03:13:40.024]  Basically saying, look, don't focus immediately on Major Hassan, focus on the fact that we have multiple eyewitnesses at Ford Hood who give interviews to ABC and CBS and the Miami Herald and the Austin TV, and they all say, we thought we were in a drill, a drill, a drill, a drill.
[03:13:40.709 --> 03:13:50.836]  Now, that's just a subjective impression, but it means that these are experienced combat soldiers, many of them, and they've been through this before, that the military is always doing drills, right?
[03:13:50.836 --> 03:13:53.057]  They do the red team and the blue team.
[03:13:53.057 --> 03:13:59.021]  They drill everything that they would normally do in combat operations or whatever it is.
[03:13:59.021 --> 03:14:04.725]  And in this case, you want to know why Hassan might have gone to this event with a gun,
[03:14:05.445 --> 03:14:15.272]  He may have known what he was doing, he may have gone with criminal intent, but then again he may have been just a psychotic Patsy Doop who walked into what he thought was a drill.
[03:14:15.272 --> 03:14:17.794]  You can look at the 9-11 hijackers.
[03:14:17.794 --> 03:14:21.797]  Most of them thought they were going to be actors in a drill.
[03:14:21.797 --> 03:14:24.579]  And they were in a drill until the drill went live.
[03:14:24.579 --> 03:14:26.140]  And that's been confirmed.
[03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:27.581]  Confirmed they were trained at U.S.
[03:14:27.581 --> 03:14:28.362]  bases.
[03:14:28.362 --> 03:14:29.683]  That's admitted, folks.
[03:14:31.905 --> 03:14:39.192]  And then of course we've got this 25-plus drills, drills operations that were completed just before 9-11.
[03:14:39.192 --> 03:14:45.357]  Ongoing, the morning of 9-11 is the majority of them, or in the advanced stages of planning.
[03:14:45.357 --> 03:14:49.421]  So the other thing then is to look for these strange anomalies and contradictions.
[03:14:50.482 --> 03:15:03.341]  The news reports during the entire afternoon of this Fort Hood tragedy, which is of course a tragic event, we were told there were three shooters, that there was one killed, and there were two others in custody.
[03:15:04.122 --> 03:15:07.344]  And this is the kind of stuff that comes out at the beginning, right?
[03:15:07.344 --> 03:15:17.471]  You've always got to go and get screenshots of what happens very early on because after a while this stuff gets expunged and people forget about it because the media is focusing on Hassan.
[03:15:17.471 --> 03:15:20.613]  But we were told that there were two other shooters.
[03:15:20.613 --> 03:15:21.493]  Where are they?
[03:15:21.493 --> 03:15:23.915]  We were told that there were two shooting incidents.
[03:15:23.915 --> 03:15:25.396]  One at this readiness center.
[03:15:26.276 --> 03:15:27.998]  And we're told that he was killed for six hours.
[03:15:27.998 --> 03:15:28.158]  Right.
[03:15:43.374 --> 03:15:47.735]  The other thing about patsies, of course, is they always do things that are physically impossible.
[03:15:47.735 --> 03:15:51.716]  And I guess the ultimate of physical impossibility is to come back from the dead.
[03:15:51.716 --> 03:16:04.920]  But we find out that Lieutenant General Cohn, the base commander, had pronounced Hassan dead, but then brought him back to life in that same press conference at about 10, 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening of the day of the shooting.
[03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:08.581]  So all of this makes us extremely suspicious.
[03:16:08.581 --> 03:16:10.282]  And then, of course, we can look at Hassan.
[03:16:11.042 --> 03:16:12.263]  And look at his profile.
[03:16:12.263 --> 03:16:17.246]  Does he fulfill this feature of the Patsy that he's got to get noticed?
[03:16:17.246 --> 03:16:19.968]  He's got to be egregious.
[03:16:19.968 --> 03:16:28.013]  For example, we have this PowerPoint presentation by Hassan, and this takes us way back into 2008, I think.
[03:16:28.013 --> 03:16:37.920]  And by the way, people are being court-martialed for criticizing Bush or Obama just slightly, but he's running around doing things that no one would be allowed to do.
[03:16:39.189 --> 03:16:44.296]  He gives this slideshow where he says, we love death more than you love life.
[03:16:44.296 --> 03:16:47.080]  This is ID format Al Qaeda speak.
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:51.606]  This is what US intelligence thinks comes out of the mouth of Al Qaeda.
[03:16:51.606 --> 03:16:53.168]  And of course, remember, Al Qaeda is this
[03:16:54.469 --> 03:17:02.254]  CIA, Arab Legion, a group of patsies, a group of terrorists, and so forth, but run by the Anglo-American intelligence.
[03:17:02.254 --> 03:17:09.518]  But we see Hassan getting away with all kinds of crazy, outrageous things.
[03:17:09.518 --> 03:17:14.341]  Apparently, the latest news is that he has business cards saying that he's a soldier of Allah.
[03:17:14.341 --> 03:17:20.825]  He wants to get other soldiers court-martialed based on what they've told him in his psychiatric interviews.
[03:17:21.226 --> 03:17:27.719]  And the way they would set this guy up, one of many, was tell him, oh, you're undercover looking for extremists.
[03:17:27.719 --> 03:17:30.485]  Oh, you're... Again, we've seen this in the past.
[03:17:32.405 --> 03:17:38.006]  Maybe he thought he was a double agent, but of course he's got to be a double agent who's not that smart.
[03:17:38.006 --> 03:17:55.730]  And indeed, among his supervisors, and this is all right down the road here, between the Bethesda complex where you have the National Institutes of Health and the National Uniformed Services... And notice he comes out of the same Blacksburg University that the other shooter was produced out of.
[03:17:56.010 --> 03:17:56.370]  Right.
[03:17:56.370 --> 03:17:56.991]  The show.
[03:17:56.991 --> 03:17:59.333]  He's got the show pedigree.
[03:17:59.333 --> 03:18:07.281]  The thing about Adnan that's interesting is, up to now, Islamic fundamentalist terrorists, so-called, come in groups.
[03:18:07.281 --> 03:18:11.846]  They have a communitarian, social aspect to them.
[03:18:11.846 --> 03:18:19.093]  But now this is the first time that I know of, since Sirhan Sirhan, in which time this was a- A lone wolf!
[03:18:19.093 --> 03:18:19.754]  A lone wolf.
[03:18:19.974 --> 03:18:29.342]  But the Islamic fundamentalist lone wolf, the troubled loner who's got the Koran in his hand, allegedly, and is fighting jihad.
[03:18:29.342 --> 03:18:30.764]  So that's a first.
[03:18:30.764 --> 03:18:36.129]  That brings together the Atta kind of guy with the Cho.
[03:18:36.129 --> 03:18:41.433]  In other words, Cho is somebody who comes out of psychiatric clinics, and so does Hassan.
[03:18:41.433 --> 03:18:44.236]  But Hassan comes out of... Well, we see that with Sirhan and McVeigh.
[03:18:44.236 --> 03:18:46.398]  They always have this psychiatric background.
[03:18:47.441 --> 03:18:49.243]  Yes, but again, now Islamic.
[03:18:49.243 --> 03:18:58.811]  So, the question is, the supervisors at Walter Reed Army Hospital, which is... Walter Reed, of course, is not quite part of that Bethesda thing, but it's just a few miles away.
[03:18:58.811 --> 03:19:03.315]  They have a meeting where they ask, is Major Hassan a psychotic?
[03:19:03.315 --> 03:19:04.877]  And, of course, the answer to that is yes.
[03:19:05.769 --> 03:19:15.437]  The big question then is, here is somebody who almost automatically has to have at least a secret level security clearance.
[03:19:15.437 --> 03:19:21.903]  Any army officer, according to what I've been able to find, has to have at least a security clearance of secret.
[03:19:21.903 --> 03:19:22.824]  He may have had more.
[03:19:22.824 --> 03:19:24.465]  He may have had top secret.
[03:19:24.465 --> 03:19:29.269]  He may have had, you know, key and code, cosmic NATO level, whatever.
[03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:30.130]  But at least secret.
[03:19:30.510 --> 03:19:39.575]  So the thing is, when you do these egregious things, and say, we love life more than you love death, that's when somebody's gonna come and investigate you, if only for the security clearance.
[03:19:39.575 --> 03:19:44.138]  Hey, if you have bad credit, you can't get a low-level security clearance.
[03:19:44.138 --> 03:19:52.482]  He's running around saying, I love Al-Qaeda, and they're just like, protecting, protecting, protecting, protecting, and then you've got the drill being reported.
[03:19:52.482 --> 03:19:54.003]  Webster, stay there.
[03:19:54.003 --> 03:19:58.826]  We're gonna finish up with the MO, what you believe really happened, and why they did this.
[03:20:01.462 --> 03:20:03.407]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:20:03.407 --> 03:20:05.914]  Do not take risky vaccinations this fall.
[03:20:06.837 --> 03:20:20.366]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, a Harvard-trained public health expert urging you to go to Fluscam.com and learn the secrets behind the current flu, who's behind it, the labs it came from, and the vaccine poisons.
[03:20:20.366 --> 03:20:31.934]  Learn why Barack Obama's Science R recommends vaccinations to sterilize people to reduce populations, and why OxySilver is making vaccinations and toxic antibiotics unnecessary.
[03:20:32.734 --> 03:20:35.836]  OxySilver is far safer than colloidal silvers.
[03:20:35.836 --> 03:20:43.699]  It works so well saving lives and money, protecting you and your family, it has been targeted for elimination by the drug cartel.

[03:21:02.794 --> 03:21:06.842]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:06.842 --> 03:21:10.069]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.069 --> 03:21:11.492]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[03:21:12.190 --> 03:21:14.871]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:14.871 --> 03:21:21.253]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.253 --> 03:21:26.795]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:21:26.795 --> 03:21:36.439]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:21:36.559 --> 03:21:38.901]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:38.901 --> 03:21:40.482]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:40.482 --> 03:21:42.944]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:42.944 --> 03:21:45.066]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:45.066 --> 03:21:50.230]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:50.230 --> 03:21:59.338]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:01.533 --> 03:22:05.636]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:22:05.636 --> 03:22:08.518]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:22:08.518 --> 03:22:10.599]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:22:10.599 --> 03:22:12.841]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:22:12.841 --> 03:22:14.502]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:22:14.502 --> 03:22:18.805]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:22:18.965 --> 03:22:21.527]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:22:21.527 --> 03:22:27.553]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[03:22:27.553 --> 03:22:32.358]  Their best seller, the Ecola Blue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:22:32.358 --> 03:22:35.180]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:22:35.180 --> 03:22:37.903]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:22:37.903 --> 03:22:39.224]  This system is free of chemicals.
[03:22:39.264 --> 03:22:39.764]  I think so.
[03:23:01.488 --> 03:23:05.990]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:10.272]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Ciaga.
[03:23:10.272 --> 03:23:21.097]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called Defense.
[03:23:21.097 --> 03:23:24.238]  These key ingredients not only supply powerful immune system-building
[03:23:24.278 --> 03:23:24.698]  Let's do it!
[03:23:44.244 --> 03:23:45.345]  He's going the distance!
[03:23:45.345 --> 03:23:46.425]  He's going for speed!
[03:23:46.425 --> 03:23:48.687]  She's all alone, all alone in her time!
[03:23:48.687 --> 03:23:50.108]  Webster Tarpley, our guest!
[03:24:13.846 --> 03:24:17.168]  Okay, Webster, continue from the point we left off at.
[03:24:17.168 --> 03:24:25.812]  A couple of things that are interesting is that Major Hassan is exchanging emails with this character, Awlaki.
[03:24:25.812 --> 03:24:29.894]  And Awlaki is obviously a kind of Pied Piper for patsies.
[03:24:29.894 --> 03:24:33.416]  He was a patsy minder for Hani Hanjour.
[03:24:33.416 --> 03:24:40.440]  That's the Pentagon pilot, supposedly, if you believe that he could do those feats of flying, which is completely impossible.
[03:24:40.780 --> 03:24:43.142]  All the top pilots have said it's a complete fraud.
[03:24:43.142 --> 03:24:43.642]  Go ahead.
[03:24:43.642 --> 03:24:56.491]  Al-Aulaqi is also a part of entrapping the Fort Dix-6 as well as this group of dupes in Toronto who took delivery of all that fertilizer, right, from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
[03:24:56.491 --> 03:24:58.553]  So Al-Aulaqi is obviously a provocateur.
[03:24:58.553 --> 03:25:05.037]  And it goes on and on and on and on and Al-Qaeda was admittedly set up by the CIA, Brzezinski.
[03:25:05.037 --> 03:25:05.958]  I mean, it's incredible.
[03:25:06.809 --> 03:25:18.778]  We also have that there is this Joint Terrorism Task Force where the information about Hassan exchanging emails with al-Awlaki, the Patsy Pied Piper, this was made available.
[03:25:18.778 --> 03:25:22.561]  But between the FBI and the Defense Criminal Investigation Service,
[03:25:23.268 --> 03:25:30.097]  They decided that this was not relevant and that the commanding officer of the base there at Fort Hood should not be told.
[03:25:30.097 --> 03:25:32.540]  So you have all of this.
[03:25:32.540 --> 03:25:37.847]  The other thing is, just like Mohammed Atta, Hassan cannot be a Muslim.
[03:25:37.847 --> 03:25:38.969]  Hassan is someone...
[03:25:39.489 --> 03:25:48.394]  And by the way, that means it's really a raunchy club, because in Texas, the ones where you bring your own liquor in are the totally nude.
[03:26:08.314 --> 03:26:09.955]  Okay, well that's where he goes.
[03:26:09.955 --> 03:26:13.740]  So he's been there at least two or three times during the month of October.
[03:26:13.740 --> 03:26:16.583]  So this is a complete farce.
[03:26:16.583 --> 03:26:22.109]  Now, in terms of what happened, I can't tell you exactly what happened.
[03:26:22.109 --> 03:26:23.911]  There are at least two scenarios.
[03:26:23.911 --> 03:26:27.135]  One is that Hassan is simply a psychotic dupe.
[03:26:27.715 --> 03:26:30.218]  And they're on record believing it was a drill.
[03:26:30.218 --> 03:26:31.620]  They all thought that.
[03:26:44.042 --> 03:26:45.984]  You know, it was what we've been through before.
[03:26:45.984 --> 03:26:48.126]  They do this all the time.
[03:26:48.126 --> 03:26:49.307]  We have drills.
[03:26:49.307 --> 03:26:51.149]  They thought they were rubber bullets.
[03:26:51.149 --> 03:26:55.754]  So Hassan might have thought, hey, I'm going to go and be an actor in a drill today.
[03:26:55.754 --> 03:26:58.797]  I'm going to play the Islamic fundamentalist who opens fires.
[03:26:58.797 --> 03:27:02.721]  So of course he's going to get up on a chair and yell, Allahu Akbar, because that's the script.
[03:27:03.221 --> 03:27:11.328]  But then the technicians show up, and the technicians would be other shooters who actually are capable of efficient shooting, right?
[03:27:11.328 --> 03:27:12.429]  More than a hundred shots.
[03:27:12.429 --> 03:27:15.171]  That's too much for one person, I think.
[03:27:15.171 --> 03:27:18.974]  Even if he's surrounded by unarmed soldiers, those are still combat veterans.
[03:27:18.974 --> 03:27:22.497]  They can tackle him or come after him or whatever it is.
[03:27:22.497 --> 03:27:25.360]  The other possibility is that Hassan has been put through
[03:27:26.169 --> 03:27:32.781]  Clockwork Orange brainwashing, and that takes us back to Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia.
[03:27:32.781 --> 03:27:34.203]  There's something going on at Blacksburg.
[03:27:34.203 --> 03:27:37.690]  And by the way, that exists, that's been declassified, that stuff is real.
[03:27:38.208 --> 03:27:42.570]  Right, and we know that we've seen Cho kill 32 people plus himself.
[03:27:42.570 --> 03:27:48.293]  We also had, at the same Virginia Tech campus, a Chinese graduate student had her head cut off.
[03:27:48.293 --> 03:27:50.154]  Oh, and I gotta stop you!
[03:27:50.154 --> 03:27:51.034]  This was confirmed.
[03:27:51.034 --> 03:27:53.695]  We first reported it here from students that live there.
[03:27:53.695 --> 03:28:02.980]  They kept having Marine Corps drills with the Marine Corps ROTC of shooting drills and takeovers, and people thought that that was happening again.
[03:28:03.476 --> 03:28:05.057]  Very, very, very interesting.
[03:28:05.057 --> 03:28:09.739]  And then, of course, there was also recently two murders at Virginia Tech in August.
[03:28:09.739 --> 03:28:13.261]  Virginia Tech is one strange place.
[03:28:13.261 --> 03:28:26.107]  So that would be the possibility that Major Hassan had been put through some kind of heavy-duty, clockwork orange brainwashing so that he was a Manchurian candidate, and if you tell him the code word, he starts shooting.
[03:28:26.107 --> 03:28:27.047]  That's possible.
[03:28:27.047 --> 03:28:27.808]  But even there,
[03:28:28.388 --> 03:28:30.570]  He could be like Sirhan Sirhan.
[03:28:30.570 --> 03:28:36.074]  All indications are Sirhan Sirhan really had a gun and really shot, but that wouldn't have been enough.
[03:28:36.074 --> 03:28:44.962]  In other words, it's... And by the way, the LA Police Department, for those that don't know, the coroner, they all said it was not the caliber that RFK was shot with.
[03:28:44.962 --> 03:28:46.423]  He was shot in the back.
[03:28:46.423 --> 03:28:48.825]  Turns out that guy was CIA.
[03:28:48.825 --> 03:28:51.066]  Other CIA people were photographed there.
[03:28:51.066 --> 03:28:54.029]  This is even mainstream news now that Sirhan was a patsy.
[03:28:54.616 --> 03:29:08.828]  So the idea is that even if Hassan is a brainwashed Patsy who goes there and shoots, to make sure that they get the effect, they've got other shooters who are much more capable, trained marksmen, professional killers.
[03:29:08.828 --> 03:29:14.973]  Or he could just be a radical Muslim extremist that they guided and allowed to attack.
[03:29:14.973 --> 03:29:18.676]  It's possible, although I think that's probably the least likely.
[03:29:18.676 --> 03:29:23.580]  But we know, we know, we know they knew according to their own story and let him do it.
[03:29:27.657 --> 03:29:41.563]  The question is, who in the Defense Intelligence Agency, who in the FBI, and who in this NIH Walter Reed Uniformed Services, who are the people who blocked any investigation or actions?
[03:29:41.563 --> 03:29:43.644]  Because those might be the moles.
[03:29:43.644 --> 03:29:46.705]  And then the final question, why'd they stage it?
[03:29:46.705 --> 03:29:51.728]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com has this article, Major Hassan at a Fort Hood, a Patsy and a drill gone wild.
[03:29:51.728 --> 03:29:54.629]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.615 --> 03:29:58.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.089 --> 03:30:10.235]  Hey folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about OxySilver, the world's most advanced silver hydrosol that Dr. Horowitz says can make risky vaccines and antibiotics avoidable.
[03:30:10.235 --> 03:30:13.597]  You've heard Dr. Leonard Horowitz and others urge vaccination avoidance.
[03:30:13.597 --> 03:30:19.481]  Instead, use vitamin CD and OxySilver along with ZeoLife for broad spectrum detoxification.
[03:30:19.481 --> 03:30:24.244]  Using NASA science, OxySilver is nanosilver covalently bonded to water.
[03:30:24.244 --> 03:30:26.606]  OxySilver safely electrocutes pathogens.
[03:30:26.866 --> 03:30:36.070]  Oxygenates for faster healing, then delivers a 528 Hz frequency homeopathic-like energy that Dr. Horowitz proves is fundamental to life and recovering health.
[03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:41.612]  He also recommends Zeolife for blood cleansing and GI Flora Pro as a probiotic for intestinal immunity.
[03:30:41.612 --> 03:30:43.453]  Help others and earn extra income!
[03:30:43.533 --> 03:30:43.713]  Thank you.
[03:31:01.670 --> 03:31:04.671]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:31:04.671 --> 03:31:10.013]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:31:10.013 --> 03:31:12.053]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:31:12.053 --> 03:31:17.055]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:31:17.055 --> 03:31:18.235]  How much do you want?
[03:31:18.235 --> 03:31:19.356]  When do you want it?
[03:31:19.356 --> 03:31:21.236]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:31:21.236 --> 03:31:22.316]  When will you need it?
[03:31:22.316 --> 03:31:24.517]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:31:24.517 --> 03:31:25.858]  Will there be any food?
[03:31:25.858 --> 03:31:27.178]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:31:27.378 --> 03:31:32.644]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:31:32.644 --> 03:31:36.249]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:31:36.249 --> 03:31:40.053]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:31:40.053 --> 03:31:41.294]  How much will you need?
[03:31:41.294 --> 03:31:42.195]  We don't know.
[03:31:42.195 --> 03:31:43.297]  How much do you want?
[03:31:43.297 --> 03:31:44.038]  All you can get.
[03:31:44.038 --> 03:31:45.039]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:45.299 --> 03:31:48.362]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:31:48.362 --> 03:31:51.205]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:31:51.205 --> 03:31:51.966]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:32:00.675 --> 03:32:04.776]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:32:04.776 --> 03:32:07.657]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:07.657 --> 03:32:09.738]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[03:32:09.738 --> 03:32:11.978]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:32:11.978 --> 03:32:13.639]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:32:13.639 --> 03:32:17.960]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:32:18.100 --> 03:32:20.682]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[03:32:31.489 --> 03:32:34.310]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:32:34.310 --> 03:32:37.032]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:37.032 --> 03:32:44.197]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:32:44.477 --> 03:32:50.442]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling Ecolablue at 1-800-691-6043.
[03:32:50.442 --> 03:32:53.284]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[03:32:53.284 --> 03:33:02.151]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[03:33:02.151 --> 03:33:13.540]  You have to understand that in all of these events when it's staged it's the same MO.
[03:33:15.083 --> 03:33:17.187]  The same handlers.
[03:33:17.187 --> 03:33:24.039]  The drill on 7-7 where the exact same trains, exact same bus were bombed at the exact same time, exact same locations.
[03:33:25.811 --> 03:33:29.935]  I'll play the clip earlier of visor consultancy head admitting the government hired him to do it.
[03:33:29.935 --> 03:33:31.516]  That way there's a smokescreen.
[03:33:31.516 --> 03:33:36.200]  That way if the patsies get caught by the wrong group, they just say it's part of a drill.
[03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:40.624]  That way if the operatives, the technicians get caught, they just say they were part of the drill.
[03:33:40.624 --> 03:33:46.549]  They use the drills to smokescreen the NSA and other compartments that may pick up the chatter.
[03:33:47.310 --> 03:33:50.031]  All right, we got about four or five minutes left here, Webster.
[03:33:50.031 --> 03:33:53.193]  The motive, obviously, morale's low in the military.
[03:33:53.193 --> 03:34:01.116]  Obama's launching a major escalation of 40,000 troops to the already 300,000 troop force of international U.S.
[03:34:01.116 --> 03:34:09.220]  and Afghan troops, 12 to 1 against the Taliban, i.e., anybody that doesn't pay their opium cut to the central banks.
[03:34:10.100 --> 03:34:17.528]  This is a way to re-launch the war, re-launch the idea that we're under attack, like the staged attack on the Pentagon on 9-11.
[03:34:17.528 --> 03:34:19.671]  This is a way to reignite the fear.
[03:34:19.671 --> 03:34:27.539]  We've seen other patsies lately where the FBI recruits them, cooks the bomb, trains them, tries to get them to bomb buildings in Illinois and other states.
[03:34:27.539 --> 03:34:28.580]  Same replay.
[03:34:29.201 --> 03:34:35.985]  Building up to another false flag, creating the illusion that we need to keep these wars going.
[03:34:35.985 --> 03:34:39.967]  Webster Tarpley, what's the modus operandi for this false flag?
[03:34:40.677 --> 03:34:42.578]  For now, the goals are two things.
[03:34:42.578 --> 03:34:44.719]  The first is that Obama is stalling.
[03:34:44.719 --> 03:34:49.461]  Obama really is dithering, and there really is a faction fight, I think, in the administration.
[03:34:49.461 --> 03:34:56.824]  You've got a faction in the State Department around this guy Eikenberry and Matthew Ho, who are saying, don't escalate, don't escalate.
[03:34:56.824 --> 03:34:58.545]  Matthew Ho is saying, get out.
[03:34:58.545 --> 03:35:01.826]  That represents a body of opinion in the State Department.
[03:35:01.826 --> 03:35:06.769]  You've even got Biden, who says, don't send more troops, just send more predator drones.
[03:35:06.769 --> 03:35:09.390]  So I think the rogue network, meaning this Wall Street
[03:35:09.890 --> 03:35:15.937]  Conglomerate is saying, you know, let's push Obama into complete escalation.
[03:35:15.937 --> 03:35:17.498]  We want Obama as a warmonger.
[03:35:17.498 --> 03:35:21.302]  Remember, the goal of that is to break up Pakistan.
[03:35:21.302 --> 03:35:25.867]  If you break up Pakistan, you're threatening China and you're also threatening Iran.
[03:35:25.867 --> 03:35:27.209]  So it's geopolitics.
[03:35:27.649 --> 03:35:43.290]  And notice this is all being launched right as the new show trial for the 9-11 patsies where they admit they've been torturing and threatening to torture their children to get them to confess to building bombings where buildings didn't exist when they were arrested.
[03:35:43.290 --> 03:35:44.191]  Just totally made up.
[03:35:45.353 --> 03:35:47.776]  But is this a test to test the waters for a bigger false flag?
[03:35:59.636 --> 03:36:00.597]  Point.
[03:36:00.597 --> 03:36:03.800]  Obama's basically saying, if I do this, I'm going to lose my whole left wing.
[03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:11.167]  And in fact, there's going to be an emergency anti-war demonstration here in Washington on December 12th in Lafayette Park at the White House.
[03:36:11.167 --> 03:36:16.152]  So Obama's going to hear protests through his own windows, which has been a rare event up to now.
[03:36:17.679 --> 03:36:22.382]  The other thing is that you have the anti-Obama opposition growing.
[03:36:22.382 --> 03:36:29.867]  The rogue network would like to endow that opposition with Islamophobia, hatred of Arabs, hatred of Muslims, and so forth.
[03:36:29.867 --> 03:36:39.433]  You look at what Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, and so forth are doing, this is now straight delirium of hatred against Islam.
[03:36:39.433 --> 03:36:42.075]  Now, a third level, maybe the higher level,
[03:36:42.883 --> 03:36:49.745]  Is that we also have this dollar crisis going on and there may be a group in the ruling elite that can control this rogue network.
[03:36:50.419 --> 03:36:50.859]  I think?
[03:37:20.299 --> 03:37:21.320]  I think at least.
[03:37:21.320 --> 03:37:28.327]  And by the way, Reuters today, IMF head eyes global currency change, presses on yuan.
[03:37:28.327 --> 03:37:39.298]  The imperative of greater global currency stability means the world can no longer rely as it's done since the end of the gold standard on currency issued by a single country, the head of the IMF said on Tuesday.
[03:37:39.298 --> 03:37:42.161]  That's Dominic Strauss-Kahn, the Bilderberg Group member.
[03:37:42.782 --> 03:37:42.842]  And
[03:37:59.224 --> 03:38:06.472]  In the near future, but I really want to thank you for the amazing piece that you wrote and sent to us to post at InfoWars.com.
[03:38:06.472 --> 03:38:09.915]  Major Hassan on Fort Hood, a Patsy and a drill gone live.
[03:38:09.915 --> 03:38:13.319]  You've only seen the tip of the iceberg with Webster in the last 30 minutes here.
[03:38:13.319 --> 03:38:19.505]  Be sure and visit InfoWars.com or WebsterTarpley.com or the other sites to read this for yourself.
[03:38:20.566 --> 03:38:22.887]  Let me put you on hold, have the crew talk to you.
[03:38:22.887 --> 03:38:27.870]  If you can come back on for another 30 minutes later on the week, just on the dollar, a separate subject.
[03:38:27.870 --> 03:38:31.012]  Thank you so much for your penetrating analysis.
[03:38:31.012 --> 03:38:34.574]  Alright, there goes Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[03:38:34.574 --> 03:38:38.537]  Shifting gears, I have a giant stack of news I haven't even blitzed yet.
[03:38:38.537 --> 03:38:45.721]  Speaking of the Taliban being a staged operation, the Times of London and others, MSNBC reported on the airlift of evil
[03:38:46.969 --> 03:38:57.503]  In January and February of 2002, how 6,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda commanders were flown out to safety into Pakistan by the CIA.
[03:38:57.503 --> 03:39:02.149]  Generals and people would capture them, would be ordered to release them, and how they would be paid in gold.
[03:39:03.561 --> 03:39:07.764]  Here it is again, yesterday, Times of London.
[03:39:07.764 --> 03:39:10.346]  Army tells its soldiers to bribe the Taliban.
[03:39:10.346 --> 03:39:12.969]  Give me a close shot for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[03:39:12.969 --> 03:39:18.393]  Army tells its soldiers to bribe the Taliban with gold.
[03:39:18.393 --> 03:39:22.496]  And it says, give them bags of gold like the US does.
[03:39:22.496 --> 03:39:24.658]  Give them bags of gold.
[03:39:27.717 --> 03:39:31.721]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, it's just, it's totally staged.
[03:39:31.721 --> 03:39:37.085]  The higher levels are just globalist mercenaries and they've got little Muslim extremists that work for them.
[03:39:37.085 --> 03:39:38.386]  This is the facts.
[03:39:38.386 --> 03:39:43.151]  This is the history.
[03:39:43.151 --> 03:39:50.737]  Shifting gears now, I want to play a few minutes from the movie The Watchman.
[03:39:50.737 --> 03:39:53.400]  When it was in theaters a few months ago, a big smash hit,
[03:39:54.634 --> 03:40:05.984]  I knew that the writer of the original comic strip is an admitted Illuminist and into high-level 33rd degree masonry.
[03:40:05.984 --> 03:40:09.227]  And so I went to see the film.
[03:40:09.227 --> 03:40:11.429]  And the only thing we've edited out of this is some of the cussing.
[03:40:12.406 --> 03:40:19.194]  And under fair use, I'm going to play this so we can break down a few minutes of the film and analyze what's going on.
[03:40:19.194 --> 03:40:26.482]  But I'm going to talk more about this later in the week because we're running out of time and there's so much evidence on this front.
[03:40:26.482 --> 03:40:29.846]  But what we're dealing with here is revelation of the method.
[03:40:30.487 --> 03:40:41.412]  The elite believes in their own writings that they must tell you what they're going to do to you beforehand, and that they must explain to you through fiction why they're doing what they're doing.
[03:40:41.412 --> 03:40:46.494]  It's just like in a sword fight with gentlemen when they say, on guard or unguard.
[03:40:46.494 --> 03:40:47.135]  On guard!
[03:40:47.135 --> 03:40:48.455]  I'm about to attack you!
[03:40:48.455 --> 03:40:49.476]  On guard!
[03:40:49.476 --> 03:40:50.496]  I'm coming at you!
[03:40:50.496 --> 03:40:52.857]  On guard!
[03:40:52.857 --> 03:40:54.718]  Gene Hagelin got a phone call.
[03:40:54.718 --> 03:40:58.420]  He was going to be in town, one of the stars of the X-Files, lone gunman, Fox TV.
[03:40:59.520 --> 03:41:01.922]  He calls me and he says, I want to come to town.
[03:41:01.922 --> 03:41:09.329]  The CIA came and gave us different plots for both of the TV shows.
[03:41:09.329 --> 03:41:22.181]  And the CIA basically told Chris Carter to produce a show where a hijacked jet is flown to the World Trade Center by a secret group inside the military industrial complex, a rogue group, a mole group.
[03:41:23.291 --> 03:41:38.917]  They remote control the jet, they use drills of hijackings and a terror drill to make NORAD stand down, to fly the plane into the World Trade Center, to blame it on Islamist terrorists, so they can invade Afghanistan.
[03:41:38.917 --> 03:41:44.059]  Now, this aired six months before 9-11.
[03:41:44.059 --> 03:41:45.580]  We played it many times.
[03:41:45.580 --> 03:41:48.241]  Just Google lone gunman episode 9-11.
[03:41:48.241 --> 03:41:50.022]  It's all over YouTube, it's all over everywhere.
[03:41:51.397 --> 03:42:00.905]  Or you can go to Best Buy or wherever and buy the one-year series of The Lone Gunman, the episode, what, 10 episodes, and you can watch it in high quality.
[03:42:00.905 --> 03:42:02.566]  We actually bought a copy of it.
[03:42:02.566 --> 03:42:14.735]  There's hundreds of these examples, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, where they tell you what they're going to do.
[03:42:14.735 --> 03:42:17.618]  They had oil storm, again, six months before Katrina.
[03:42:18.949 --> 03:42:23.953]  The mayor was even part of the production where it hits, it floods it, martial law happens.
[03:42:23.953 --> 03:42:25.575]  We know they have weather control systems.
[03:42:25.575 --> 03:42:31.020]  I've interviewed the creator of it, Ben Livingston, meteorologist.
[03:42:31.020 --> 03:42:32.601]  They're now admitting all this.
[03:42:32.601 --> 03:42:37.945]  Weather control is being admitted by the White House science czar, John P. Holdren.
[03:42:37.945 --> 03:42:39.427]  But look, it goes on and on.
[03:42:40.322 --> 03:42:46.986]  The issue here is, psychopaths love to brag, they love to taunt the police, they love to toy with people.
[03:42:46.986 --> 03:42:49.127]  This is their modus operandi.
[03:42:49.127 --> 03:42:56.611]  Now, when you go watch this two-hour film, and don't show it to children, it's very violent, especially the director's cut, the widescreen edition.
[03:42:58.237 --> 03:43:04.562]  But you should watch it, because when I walked out of the theater, almost everyone was saying, I don't get it, I don't understand it.
[03:43:04.562 --> 03:43:11.088]  I saw review after review after review that said, no one understands this.
[03:43:11.088 --> 03:43:16.752]  This would be like showing someone 2 plus 2 equals 4 and they don't understand it.
[03:43:16.752 --> 03:43:24.899]  They explain in the movie that this Mandamus character, who's like the Luciferian enlightened one,
[03:43:28.604 --> 03:43:38.097]  That he stages terror attacks and blows up all these world cities killing millions and millions of people so that the world will come together for a world government.
[03:43:40.256 --> 03:43:43.879]  And he admits they staged World War I, World War II, the Cold War.
[03:43:43.879 --> 03:43:48.623]  It's all staged to bring in this one world government so there'll be total peace.
[03:43:48.623 --> 03:44:00.933]  Now the only true superhero in it, Dr. Manhattan, who can create planets, do whatever he wants, be anywhere in the universe, he is trying to stop whoever's blowing up US cities.
[03:44:00.933 --> 03:44:03.395]  Until he finally catches his former partner,
[03:44:06.920 --> 03:44:12.101]  And that's the scene we're going to play where he catches him and he explains, I had to do it to create unity.
[03:44:12.101 --> 03:44:15.002]  And then Dr. Manhattan says, oh, you're right, I understand.
[03:44:15.002 --> 03:44:19.663]  And the moral person, Rorschach, goes out and kills child molesters and people.
[03:44:19.663 --> 03:44:21.043]  He's the bad guy at the end.
[03:44:21.043 --> 03:44:24.424]  And they go, yes, you're trying to stop child molesters.
[03:44:24.424 --> 03:44:25.604]  That's earlier in the movie.
[03:44:25.604 --> 03:44:27.284]  You are the bad one.
[03:44:27.284 --> 03:44:31.085]  You don't like raping children and dogs eating their rotten bodies.
[03:44:31.085 --> 03:44:32.586]  You are bad.
[03:44:32.586 --> 03:44:34.686]  And Dr. Manhattan kills him.
[03:44:38.268 --> 03:44:41.671]  This is a day we shall never forget.
[03:44:41.671 --> 03:44:51.999]  And yet we go forward to defend the human race and all that is good and just in our world.
[03:44:51.999 --> 03:44:54.160]  Thank you.
[03:44:54.160 --> 03:44:56.482]  God bless us all.
[03:44:56.482 --> 03:44:58.263]  Do you see?
[03:44:58.263 --> 03:45:03.748]  Two superpowers retreating from war.
[03:45:03.748 --> 03:45:07.210]  I've saved the Earth from hell.
[03:45:07.210 --> 03:45:07.811]  We both have.
[03:45:09.485 --> 03:45:13.206]  This is as much your victory as it is mine.
[03:45:13.206 --> 03:45:16.687]  Now we can return.
[03:45:16.687 --> 03:45:21.008]  Do what we were meant to.
[03:45:21.008 --> 03:45:24.708]  We were meant to exact justice.
[03:45:24.708 --> 03:45:26.789]  Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
[03:45:26.789 --> 03:45:33.150]  Well then, by exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today.
[03:45:33.150 --> 03:45:34.651]  Peace based on a lie.
[03:45:34.651 --> 03:45:35.191]  But peace...
[03:45:36.872 --> 03:45:38.053]  None of us.
[03:45:38.053 --> 03:45:39.675]  He's right.
[03:45:39.675 --> 03:45:43.738]  Exposing Hadrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
[03:45:43.738 --> 03:45:43.938]  No.
[03:45:43.938 --> 03:45:46.060]  We can't do this.
[03:45:46.060 --> 03:45:50.044]  On Mars.
[03:45:50.044 --> 03:45:52.826]  You taught me the value of life.
[03:45:52.826 --> 03:46:01.875]  If we hope to preserve it here, we must remain silent.
[03:46:01.875 --> 03:46:03.016]  Keep your own secrets.
[03:46:10.757 --> 03:46:14.642]  Don't even think about it.
[03:46:14.642 --> 03:46:18.026]  Rorschach!
[03:46:18.026 --> 03:46:20.649]  Wait.
[03:46:20.649 --> 03:46:23.052]  Never compromise.
[03:46:23.052 --> 03:46:26.355]  Not even in the face of Armageddon.
[03:46:26.355 --> 03:46:27.637]  It's always been the difference to you.
[03:46:40.402 --> 03:46:45.483]  I've made myself feel every death.
[03:46:45.483 --> 03:46:50.384]  See every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity.
[03:46:50.384 --> 03:46:59.067]  You understand, don't you?
[03:46:59.067 --> 03:47:02.347]  Without condoning.
[03:47:02.347 --> 03:47:08.749]  Or condemning.
[03:47:08.749 --> 03:47:09.189]  I understand.
[03:47:15.051 --> 03:47:16.893]  Dad.
[03:47:16.893 --> 03:47:22.919]  A world united in a peace that had to be sacrificed.
[03:47:22.919 --> 03:47:25.942]  You have an idealized mankind, but you've deformed it.
[03:47:25.942 --> 03:47:28.585]  You mutilated it.
[03:47:28.585 --> 03:47:29.486]  That's your legacy.
[03:47:29.486 --> 03:47:32.869]  Out of my way.
[03:47:32.869 --> 03:47:33.930]  People have to be told.
[03:47:33.930 --> 03:47:36.473]  You know I can't let you do that.
[03:47:49.599 --> 03:47:52.041]  I should have cared from the start.
[03:47:52.041 --> 03:47:54.563]  None of this would have happened.
[03:47:54.563 --> 03:48:00.468]  What are you waiting for?
[03:48:27.495 --> 03:48:28.456]  And now he's dead.
[03:48:28.456 --> 03:48:34.463]  There's the beautiful Rorschach pattern of his blood and guts, the beauty, the artwork of Dr. Manhattan.
[03:48:34.463 --> 03:48:41.511]  And Dr. Manhattan is being blamed for all these cities worldwide and tens of millions dead.
[03:48:41.511 --> 03:48:48.239]  Blamed by his former partner that actually staged the terror attacks to bring the world together with the outside threat.
[03:48:49.966 --> 03:48:52.387]  And that's why the Pentagon staged 9-11.
[03:48:52.387 --> 03:48:58.229]  They think it's beautiful and good they killed 3,000 people so they can have their world government to bring you peace.
[03:48:58.229 --> 03:49:00.450]  That's why they gave nukes to North Korea.
[03:49:00.450 --> 03:49:02.291]  That's why they gave nukes to Pakistan.
[03:49:02.291 --> 03:49:04.792]  That's why they create Saddam and Bin Laden.
[03:49:04.792 --> 03:49:08.173]  So they can be the good guy that saves you from all of it.
[03:49:09.360 --> 03:49:10.941]  But that's only one level.
[03:49:10.941 --> 03:49:29.688]  But this is still very high-level Illuminati New World Order programming, the dark side reaching out to you at a subconscious level, the general public having no idea the high-level ritual they've just been part of, not understanding it, wandering out of the movie theater saying, I didn't get that.
[03:49:29.688 --> 03:49:33.170]  They staged the terror attacks to bring in world government.
[03:49:34.639 --> 03:49:39.560]  Justice Kissinger says in real documents they have to stage events, stage crises.
[03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:47.183]  This is the reality of the New World Order.
[03:49:47.183 --> 03:49:48.943]  This is what they're doing.
[03:49:48.943 --> 03:49:50.704]  This is what they're setting up.
[03:49:50.704 --> 03:49:52.424]  This is why they kill us.
[03:49:52.424 --> 03:49:53.804]  This is why they do everything.
[03:49:53.804 --> 03:49:55.405]  And Rorschach is the bad guy.
[03:49:56.809 --> 03:49:58.770]  He doesn't like them murdering children.
[03:49:58.770 --> 03:50:00.690]  He doesn't like child molesters.
[03:50:00.690 --> 03:50:01.850]  He's the bad guy.
[03:50:01.850 --> 03:50:05.611]  The message is, he's the bad guy because he has morals.
[03:50:05.611 --> 03:50:08.972]  And if you watch the whole movie, he is the bad guy.
[03:50:08.972 --> 03:50:11.473]  He is the evil person.
[03:50:11.473 --> 03:50:12.653]  And that's how the globalist are.
[03:50:12.653 --> 03:50:18.375]  We talked to Dr. Bianca, the local guy that says 90% of the public have to be killed by airborne Ebola.
[03:50:20.029 --> 03:50:22.450]  He says, oh, I'm very sad that my family and I have to die.
[03:50:22.450 --> 03:50:28.773]  You know, it's the same thing of, oh, I'm very sad that we all have to die, but it's what we have to do to save the earth.
[03:50:28.773 --> 03:50:32.095]  We got to do something for the earth when it's all a fraud.
[03:50:32.095 --> 03:50:34.136]  This is their pure evil.
[03:50:34.136 --> 03:50:36.197]  This is their corruption.
[03:50:36.197 --> 03:50:37.437]  This is what they're doing.
[03:50:37.437 --> 03:50:40.579]  This is how they're throwing it in your face like you're morons.
[03:50:41.940 --> 03:50:48.062]  They're going to bring in world government and kill 80-90% of us in their own government textbooks like eco-science.
[03:50:48.062 --> 03:50:54.004]  You better wake up, you better realize what's going on, and you better understand they've warned you.
[03:50:54.004 --> 03:50:56.605]  World government is only the beginning.
[03:50:56.605 --> 03:51:01.107]  Once they have it in place, you're as dead as a doornail through soft kill weapons.
[03:51:02.626 --> 03:51:07.747]  I have owned every light you can think of, and my Paclite is the one I refuse to leave home without.
[03:51:07.747 --> 03:51:09.688]  That's what Jerry from Oregon said.
[03:51:09.688 --> 03:51:11.148]  Your flashlights are the best.
[03:51:11.148 --> 03:51:17.229]  We bought some three years ago, and all three Paclites have gone through two hurricanes each, and they just keep going on and on.
[03:51:17.229 --> 03:51:20.470]  And that's what Albert in Florida said about the amazing Paclite.
[03:51:20.470 --> 03:51:28.112]  Paclite's multicolored cabs come equipped with two high-powered LED lights, snap on to any 9-volt battery, and will last over 1,200 hours.
[03:51:28.112 --> 03:51:29.772]  Listen to what Jerry from Michigan said.
[03:51:30.012 --> 03:51:33.395]  After carrying a Paclite in my pants pocket for two years, it was bound to happen.
[03:51:33.395 --> 03:51:36.217]  The pants and the light went through the wash together, and it still works!
[03:51:36.217 --> 03:51:41.541]  The Paclite has a 25-year warranty, starts at just $12.99, and is an excellent gift idea.

[03:52:03.683 --> 03:52:07.709]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.709 --> 03:52:10.974]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.974 --> 03:52:12.377]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:13.081 --> 03:52:15.742]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.742 --> 03:52:22.143]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:22.143 --> 03:52:27.324]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.324 --> 03:52:37.306]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:37.426 --> 03:52:39.788]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.788 --> 03:52:41.369]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:41.369 --> 03:52:43.831]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.831 --> 03:52:45.952]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.952 --> 03:52:51.116]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:51.116 --> 03:53:00.223]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:53:02.253 --> 03:53:06.735]  For the past year you've heard about GardenInACan.com right here on GCN.
[03:53:06.735 --> 03:53:12.398]  GardenInACan.com is your source for premium non-hybrid and non-genetically modified seeds.
[03:53:12.398 --> 03:53:17.721]  Each order includes 16 carefully selected varieties made specifically for both spring and fall
[03:53:18.021 --> 03:53:18.561]  We're good to go.
[03:53:35.486 --> 03:53:35.966]  I think so.
[03:54:05.114 --> 03:54:06.255]  All right.
[03:54:06.255 --> 03:54:08.638]  We're gonna have open phones again tomorrow.
[03:54:08.638 --> 03:54:09.839]  Tons of news blitzing.
[03:54:09.839 --> 03:54:21.351]  We're taking this radio transmission to the next level.
[03:54:21.351 --> 03:54:25.335]  But I wanted, at the end of the radio show today, because gold went up above $1,140,
[03:54:29.252 --> 03:54:31.917]  It's just rising, rising, rising to have Ted up.
[03:54:31.917 --> 03:54:35.022]  He has a few of the gold items left.
[03:54:35.022 --> 03:54:35.563]  Very few.
[03:54:36.849 --> 03:54:39.110]  At the $1,000 level.
[03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:44.232]  That is, he bought into the market when it was 140-something bucks, lower than it is now.
[03:54:44.232 --> 03:54:46.113]  So he can pass on those savings.
[03:54:46.113 --> 03:54:49.275]  Some of the other stuff went up to around $1,050.
[03:54:49.275 --> 03:54:52.276]  Still $90-plus under what the market is.
[03:54:52.276 --> 03:54:54.237]  You're not gonna find deals like this, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:54.237 --> 03:54:55.838]  Ted is a big gold broker.
[03:54:55.838 --> 03:54:59.619]  He gives these specials to my listeners because he's a patriot.
[03:54:59.619 --> 03:55:01.380]  And he loves to be competitive.
[03:55:01.380 --> 03:55:02.340]  He's a free market guy, 110%.
[03:55:04.818 --> 03:55:06.901]  Again, I told you to buy gold when it was 280, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 850, 900, 1,000.
[03:55:06.901 --> 03:55:09.164]  It just goes up and up because they're devaluing the dollar.
[03:55:09.164 --> 03:55:10.105]  You need to physically hold silver and gold.
[03:55:10.105 --> 03:55:10.986]  Ted, tell people today's offer.
[03:55:20.862 --> 03:55:23.865]  I have going today are the things that I offered from yesterday.
[03:55:23.865 --> 03:55:24.385]  The $10 Liberties at $8.18.50.
[03:55:24.385 --> 03:55:25.086]  I have $20 Liberties at $16.32.
[03:55:25.086 --> 03:55:25.746]  I still have Lakotas.
[03:55:25.746 --> 03:55:27.207]  Right now they're currently at $222.44.
[03:55:27.207 --> 03:55:27.968]  Walking Liberty Halves at $8.69.
[03:55:27.968 --> 03:55:28.849]  British Sovereigns
[03:55:38.917 --> 03:55:40.318]  Right now we're at $3.25.
[03:55:40.318 --> 03:55:47.083]  They just went up from $2.99, and the Franks went from $246 to $263.
[03:55:47.083 --> 03:55:50.806]  So congratulations to all of you who have picked those up.
[03:55:50.806 --> 03:55:52.507]  But the rest of the market's moving.
[03:55:52.507 --> 03:55:54.769]  There are a few other items that I have.
[03:55:54.769 --> 03:55:57.031]  I don't have enough to mention it because people are going to call up.
[03:55:57.031 --> 03:55:58.672]  It's going to be sold out by the time they get in.
[03:55:58.712 --> 03:56:04.938]  But even your new deal, because you sold out of the super low, it's still, what, 90-something dollars lower in the market?
[03:56:04.938 --> 03:56:07.881]  Yeah, it's all discounted based upon what I bought in the past.
[03:56:07.881 --> 03:56:10.724]  So right now, this is a good time to be buying.
[03:56:10.724 --> 03:56:12.566]  And, you know, I don't know what you need.
[03:56:12.566 --> 03:56:15.669]  I mean, the market is saying, get into gold.
[03:56:15.669 --> 03:56:17.351]  The dollar is falling.
[03:56:17.831 --> 03:56:18.692]  Look at Reuters!
[03:56:18.692 --> 03:56:19.513]  Look at Reuters!
[03:56:19.513 --> 03:56:22.355]  IMF head eyes global currency change.
[03:56:22.355 --> 03:56:24.757]  I mean, that is, that is Reuters today.
[03:56:24.757 --> 03:56:28.881]  I'll give the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I mean, gold, ladies and gentlemen!
[03:56:28.881 --> 03:56:30.022]  Get involved in it now!
[03:56:30.022 --> 03:56:31.984]  800-686-2237.
[03:56:31.984 --> 03:56:35.027]  Ted, can you hold this deal until midnight again?
[03:56:35.027 --> 03:56:36.929]  Yes, I will hold this deal until midnight.
[03:56:37.694 --> 03:56:47.100]  But I really want to encourage people to get in and get involved with this because the market's running away from them.
[03:56:47.100 --> 03:56:48.501]  800-686-2237.
[03:56:48.501 --> 03:56:49.081]  800-686-2237.
[03:56:49.081 --> 03:56:53.304]  We ought to pull up some video clips from a couple years ago when gold's like 500 bucks an ounce.
[03:56:53.304 --> 03:56:54.264]  And I'm like, get in!
[03:56:54.264 --> 03:56:56.526]  I think it's only going to go up.
[03:56:56.526 --> 03:57:01.229]  I mean, to really show people, to illustrate what's happening, 800-686-2237.
[03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:04.431]  They are openly announcing they're gutting the dollar.
[03:57:05.174 --> 03:57:09.135]  I mean, and ladies and gentlemen, there's no other investment out there that's quadrupled.
[03:57:09.135 --> 03:57:14.956]  It's now quadrupled from 260 up to over 1,140 right now.
[03:57:14.956 --> 03:57:18.997]  I mean, what else is doing that?
[03:57:18.997 --> 03:57:20.177]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:20.177 --> 03:57:23.898]  Ted, you gotta feel good being able to offer deals that no one else can even come close to.
[03:57:23.898 --> 03:57:30.620]  Well, what's really great is when my customers need to sell back to me and I'm giving them this $400 increase in their portfolio.
[03:57:30.620 --> 03:57:30.960]  It's just...
[03:57:31.857 --> 03:57:35.140]  You know, it really feels good to know that I'm helping people.
[03:57:35.140 --> 03:57:39.305]  So you are, some people are selling their gold back to you that bought it at 500 bucks an ounce?
[03:57:39.305 --> 03:57:41.347]  You know, people, you know, some people die.
[03:57:41.347 --> 03:57:46.912]  I had a guy come in, one guy picked up over a million dollars worth of gold from us down there when gold was at about 400.
[03:57:48.021 --> 03:57:49.923]  His brother came in who got the inheritance.
[03:57:49.923 --> 03:57:51.164]  He was laid off.
[03:57:51.164 --> 03:57:57.229]  He was able to sell about $150,000 worth of gold four times higher than the customer had bought it.
[03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:58.791]  That's just one example.
[03:57:58.791 --> 03:58:02.614]  And you gotta understand, Ted Anderson has literally tiny markups.
[03:58:02.614 --> 03:58:04.136]  He's making just tiny slivers.
[03:58:04.756 --> 03:58:07.117]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:58:26.408 --> 03:58:28.809]  And the key here is tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[03:58:28.809 --> 03:58:30.569]  You'll be paying more and it's still a great price.
