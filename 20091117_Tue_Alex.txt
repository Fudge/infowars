[00:45.440 --> 00:53.920]  November 2009 hard to believe that this year is very long in the tooth seems like it was
[00:53.920 --> 01:01.880]  in diapers just five minutes ago but it's definitely growing a long beard and I want
[01:01.880 --> 01:09.400]  to open the phones up throughout the entire four-hour transmission today to talk about
[01:09.400 --> 01:15.680]  cap and trade to talk about Al Gore is being confronted everywhere to discuss the plunging
[01:15.680 --> 01:21.760]  of the dollar the explosion of gold the open announcements of world government the police

[02:08.800 --> 02:13.520]  a day and serializing what they're saying we're not going to be able to play that and

[02:19.480 --> 02:23.760]  messages it's really hard for our limited staff to go through those and that's penalizing

[08:10.960 --> 08:29.840]  network
[08:29.840 --> 08:37.680]  it's here ladies and gentlemen world government world government is now upon us the denial
[08:37.680 --> 08:44.960]  is over but for many people the denial isn't over it should be over but after decades of
[08:44.960 --> 08:51.440]  the controlled left and the controlled right the rush limbaugh's and the bill clinton's
[08:51.440 --> 08:56.400]  laughing at people that talk about a UN takeover making fun of people that talk about a world
[08:56.400 --> 09:02.880]  court making fun of anyone that discusses carbon taxes anyone who reads all the official
[09:02.880 --> 09:10.200]  club of Rome CFR UN State Department documents anyone who reads the textbooks written by
[09:10.200 --> 09:19.480]  carol quigley for the CIA anyone who is based in reality is called a lunatic while the establishment
[09:19.480 --> 09:27.680]  was stalling buying time to get their cashless society surveillance control grid in place
[09:27.680 --> 09:33.120]  and they've now got it in place and they've now bankrupted our economy all the major
[09:33.120 --> 09:38.680]  mainline economist big firms that study it we've had our economist experts on to break
[09:38.680 --> 09:47.760]  down the numbers show unemployment above 20% the mainstream media says it's above 10 and
[09:47.760 --> 09:55.000]  it's only going to get worse with Obama by design running around saying America can't
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.200]  compete America's bad everybody should move their businesses to China with Bernanke coming
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.800]  out in the Associated Press and saying oh I'm watching the dollars decline but I'm more
[10:06.800 --> 10:14.680]  worried about interest rates keeping them low will continue to drive the dollar down
[10:14.680 --> 10:17.680]  and you notice that even though the dollars plunging they had said that that would boost
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.760]  manufacturing it's actually down to record levels because this was all done by design
[10:23.760 --> 10:29.560]  officially stated by the UN and remember it's not the UN taking over America the Pentagon
[10:29.560 --> 10:36.920]  the military industrial complex 1945 needed an imperial model with a general assembly
[10:36.920 --> 10:41.800]  debating society for the powerless third world where the true power at the UN the security
[10:41.800 --> 10:47.520]  council run by the United States in England and Europe could call all the shots it was
[10:47.520 --> 10:52.760]  an embryonic world government 60 plus years ago it is not an embryonic world government
[10:52.760 --> 10:59.400]  now it is on its legs it is strong it's got big sharp teeth and we as a society are facing
[10:59.400 --> 11:05.960]  it and if we could simply warn the public and illustrate the type of technocracy we're
[11:05.960 --> 11:11.760]  facing we could defeat it and a lot of the public is starting to finally shake themselves
[11:11.760 --> 11:18.480]  out of their malaise out of the trance they're in and look around them but it's not enough
[11:18.480 --> 11:23.800]  and it's not happening fast enough a lot of encouraging things are developing but we are
[11:23.800 --> 11:29.680]  definitely in deep water right now we are far from getting out of these woods now here's
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.880]  what I'm going to do I'm going to take calls to do something different this entire hour
[11:33.880 --> 11:38.680]  before I even start news blitzing at a lot of audio a lot of video clips a lot coming
[11:38.680 --> 11:45.720]  up today that's important but I want to go to your phone calls right now to ask you where
[11:45.720 --> 11:51.920]  do you see the future going how do you think we should wake people up what's the best strategy
[11:51.920 --> 11:56.080]  through leaderless resistance to awaken the people and take over our counties and cities
[11:56.080 --> 12:02.840]  and states peacefully and say no to the new world order how do we wake up the military
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.080]  and the police to understand how their compartmentalized and how they're being used to carry out
[12:08.080 --> 12:11.680]  something that's extremely wicked how do we reach out to the other government bureaucrats
[12:11.680 --> 12:16.960]  and the private corporate leaders that if they could see the full picture would not
[12:16.960 --> 12:26.740]  go along with this how do we get the public and the population to come out of denial
[12:26.740 --> 12:30.840]  you notice they're having trouble passing cap and trade you notice they're having trouble
[12:30.840 --> 12:36.960]  passing the global tax you notice they're having trouble passing their government takeover
[12:36.960 --> 12:43.560]  of health care we've got a fighting chance if we kick and scream and fight with a hundred
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.800]  percent of our energy and it doesn't mean you have to save the world by yourself or
[12:47.800 --> 12:51.280]  that you have to have all the answers you've just got to get focused you've got to get
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.920]  angry you've got to get on the streets in the county commissioners in the city councils
[12:55.920 --> 13:02.640]  in the state houses everywhere Al Gore goes everywhere Kathleen Cibales goes everywhere
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.880]  the ghouls of this system and the spokesman of this system go you've got to pick an issue
[13:07.880 --> 13:15.120]  or two and get out there and engage these people because this is for all the chips this is
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.120]  the main assault the globalist of an ounce of the New York Times they're going to try
[13:19.120 --> 13:25.080]  to legalize all illegal aliens and bring in unlimited third world populations to further
[13:25.080 --> 13:30.000]  bankrupt the social welfare system by design and bring us deeper into debt that's being
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.920]  announced everything is in motion this is the big assault this is the beginning of the
[13:35.920 --> 13:42.320]  final battle and you are on the field whether you want to consciously admit that to yourself
[13:42.320 --> 13:46.760]  or not because the new order doesn't take prisoners they they brainwash people they
[13:46.760 --> 13:51.640]  take their minds they take their intellects they shatter them they fill them full of propaganda
[13:51.640 --> 13:56.920]  they literally poison the population with disinformation and mental sickness and illness
[13:56.920 --> 14:02.320]  with their different psychological warfare programs they poison the public physically
[14:02.320 --> 14:08.520]  to the water supply the GMO food the chemtrail spring it's all real and I know it's frightening
[14:08.520 --> 14:15.040]  to admit we're in 21st century Buck Rogers tyranny I know it's hard to deal with believe
[14:15.040 --> 14:22.960]  me I woke up at two fifteen last night didn't sleep walked outside and watched the meteor
[14:22.960 --> 14:27.200]  shower didn't know there was a big meteor shower went inside and googled it and found
[14:27.200 --> 14:33.760]  out there was a big meteor shower that was expected to happen I sat there in the cool
[14:33.760 --> 14:40.040]  misty dark of the night sitting on my front porch and pacing around in the darkness listening
[14:40.040 --> 14:50.440]  to coyotes howl in the distance a big buck jumped out of the trees across the street
[14:50.440 --> 14:57.200]  from my house and sat there snorting in the starlight the world is so beautiful there's
[14:57.200 --> 15:01.640]  so many great things there's so many good things there's so much innocent there's so
[15:01.640 --> 15:06.840]  much beauty there's so much honor there's so much purity and it's because there's all
[15:06.840 --> 15:11.360]  that goodness that it's it's a fight we have to take up against the evil because if we
[15:11.360 --> 15:17.760]  don't stand against it it will take over the world we can't turn over our society to these
[15:17.760 --> 15:23.360]  psychopathic technocrats who are carrying out all this wickedness against us we've got
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.600]  to wake up we've got to stand up we've got to get involved and I salute all of you that
[15:28.600 --> 15:35.080]  are out there fighting tyranny let's go ahead and go to your phone calls as promised let's
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.760]  talk to frank in New York Frank you're on the air good afternoon Alex I want to commend
[15:40.760 --> 15:50.200]  you on the fall of the republic it's an excellent DVD that historicizes the current status of
[15:50.200 --> 15:58.440]  the west beautifully in a logical and non-aggressive fashion and I wanted to say that I've been
[15:58.440 --> 16:03.440]  listening to your show frequently and I'm impressed with what you did with the mere
[16:03.440 --> 16:07.600]  two hundred thousand dollars if that were done for broadcast TV that would be a twelve
[16:07.600 --> 16:13.880]  million dollar production no doubt about it so I think that's been a tremendous benefit
[16:13.880 --> 16:19.200]  in raising the awareness of the people here in the state but I think Alex we have to also
[16:19.200 --> 16:25.720]  look at the primary discourse and what frightens me about cap and trade is that we have the
[16:25.720 --> 16:30.120]  young Rothschilds and the young Rockefellers demanding that this be implemented yet their
[16:30.120 --> 16:34.920]  fortunes for the last two hundred years have been made raping the earth with their support
[16:34.920 --> 16:40.040]  of industry in the united states in Europe the petroleum industry many others and they've
[16:40.040 --> 16:46.320]  always been able to keep their wealth in irrevocable trust where they pay no taxes and they're
[16:46.320 --> 16:51.360]  able to utilize that money to fund their own initiative and I think what we must do with
[16:51.360 --> 16:56.440]  this discourse and I think it would be good to raise this when Al Gore speaks is that
[16:56.440 --> 17:01.800]  by him profiting over a billion dollars with the cap and trade legislation he becomes a
[17:01.800 --> 17:06.800]  criminal raping guy and therefore he should be arrested for that and confiscated and
[17:06.800 --> 17:15.640]  I would say yes I remember who he in 1998 cooked up the current cap and tax system with
[17:15.640 --> 17:21.560]  it's on record in congressional testimony can lay I mean this is Ken lay this is Bernard
[17:21.560 --> 17:27.680]  Madoff this is a joke this is a joke it's so ridiculous that we'd have these criminal
[17:27.680 --> 17:33.800]  con artists just laughing at us and having their way with us but you know you mentioned
[17:33.800 --> 17:39.920]  the bankers in 1906 with the Sherman antitrust act which they advertised they were against
[17:39.920 --> 17:45.080]  which they actually wrote to make all their money and wealth tax free now look at how
[17:45.080 --> 17:49.240]  Ted Turner Bill Gates Warren Buffett they all put their money in tax free and then they
[17:49.240 --> 17:58.000]  use the profit tax free to carry out eugenics I mean that it's admitted that's what they're
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  doing and it made me think of a New York Times article today where they in plain sight admit
[18:04.000 --> 18:11.760]  that both the Republican and Democratic talking points were written by several lobbying firms
[18:11.760 --> 18:16.760]  for big pharma and a genetic engineering company and then it was all staged but the New York
[18:16.760 --> 18:22.440]  Times says that's a good thing I mean they just announced openly that most TV shows are
[18:22.440 --> 18:28.320]  now paid for by the Pentagon and the Department of Justice with anti-gun anti-family pro-global
[18:28.320 --> 18:36.960]  warming messages I mean we are living in a absolute tyranny the final vestiges of freedom
[18:36.960 --> 18:42.120]  are being shut down and they don't want to shut me down immediately they just want to
[18:42.120 --> 18:48.240]  demonize me because that would be too much of a signal to people that this is real corruption
[18:48.240 --> 18:55.560]  but it just makes my head spin how un-American and how Soviet that is to have most TV being
[18:55.560 --> 19:00.480]  written by the White House it just it just blows my mind I can't believe we're letting
[19:00.480 --> 19:08.240]  this happen Frank you was the communications theorist recognize that but I wanted to also
[19:08.240 --> 19:14.000]  say this that I would suggest that everyone and people are wising up when they lose their
[19:14.000 --> 19:20.720]  jobs or they find out that their 401k has been looted or it's valueless they begin to
[19:20.720 --> 19:25.840]  rise up very quickly and start to question and I'm going to say this I think they may
[19:25.840 --> 19:31.400]  have underestimated the spirit of the American in the sense that when they lose the little
[19:31.400 --> 19:37.880]  they have they're going to be awfully mad and I think just keep track keep keep a list
[19:37.880 --> 19:43.480]  of the names who's doing what who promoted this legislation who prevented the debate

[24:20.760 --> 24:28.920]  deep behind occupied territory part of the world government we are literal captives
[24:31.160 --> 24:36.920]  but only captives in our minds the physical grid is now going into place there's still time to stop
[24:36.920 --> 24:43.880]  this to stop this peacefully jonathan in kansas you're on the air welcome
[24:43.880 --> 24:53.320]  um thank you um npr two weeks ago admitted that head start has been proven to not actually be
[24:53.320 --> 25:00.600]  effective and they prove it uh they prove uh provided that child einstein program uh is
[25:00.600 --> 25:07.080]  actually counterproductive and they found that talking to the child is more productive than
[25:07.080 --> 25:12.840]  television oh but don't worry they'll they'll have a bigger government program to fix the last
[25:12.840 --> 25:17.720]  crisis they created i have the department of education documents we sell them in a compendium
[25:17.720 --> 25:24.200]  by charlotte isherby they had a policy the department of education 1981 and 1985 number two position
[25:24.200 --> 25:29.400]  where they stated that their goal the book is called the liberate dumbing down it's made it's
[25:29.400 --> 25:35.000]  the size of a dallas phone book where they admitted they wanted to turn the kids into
[25:35.000 --> 25:44.120]  mindless drones who didn't have any critical thinking go ahead right right also i wanted
[25:44.120 --> 25:51.480]  to get into some soft kill weapons like you mentioned um hot dogs are full of sodium nitrate
[25:51.480 --> 25:58.280]  which is used to induce cancer and lab rats i just want to let people know that but the poison
[25:58.280 --> 26:04.040]  sure tastes good yeah it's got a bunch of different types of msg in it that kill rats
[26:04.040 --> 26:13.400]  better than a hammer but hey enjoy oh um uh also uh my father he's originally he's from the third
[26:13.400 --> 26:20.200]  world and um there's mid there is it's true there is medicinal natural stuff that does kill
[26:20.200 --> 26:27.800]  diseases viruses um when he was younger he was bit by a wild animal and he had babies he took a
[26:27.800 --> 26:35.560]  medicinal um he was just from some local local medicine some medicinal natural stuff and he got
[26:35.560 --> 26:43.000]  it just killed it and um i don't know my aunts told the story my aunts told the story when they
[26:43.000 --> 26:49.640]  lived in guatemala with their young children where one of my cousins was super i don't want to
[26:49.640 --> 26:53.080]  say deathly ill but i believe she said that it's been years since i heard her tell the story
[26:53.080 --> 26:59.880]  and the local hospital couldn't help him uh but one of the local uh herbal ladies you know we'd
[26:59.880 --> 27:10.760]  call him a witch doctor curating go ahead yeah and um my father too he didn't when um they came
[27:10.760 --> 27:18.760]  around and they gave him uh they were giving out vaccines for i think smallpox um he didn't take
[27:18.760 --> 27:24.920]  the smallpox what he did was uh his mom gave him like i don't know like someone was sick
[27:24.920 --> 27:32.040]  and they took the pus from a smallpox and put it in one of his wounds and that's the 400 year old
[27:32.040 --> 27:39.720]  original system invented in england and so that's a natural form of inoculation and it is dangerous
[27:39.720 --> 27:45.480]  but the studies show that it's a lot safer than the uh regular smallpox inoculation but again it's
[27:45.480 --> 27:52.440]  all dangerous good to hear from you my friend let's go ahead and take another call let's talk to
[27:52.440 --> 28:02.280]  jason in georgia hey alex hey a couple points on npr the other day uh one of their correspondents
[28:02.280 --> 28:07.640]  can't remember her name had gone and had a mammogram done and i'm assuming she must be one of the
[28:07.640 --> 28:13.800]  washington dc correspondence because she set off a geiger counter going into one of the federal
[28:13.800 --> 28:23.480]  buildings there right after her mammogram that was on cnn okay wow uh no no i'm asking you i'm
[28:23.480 --> 28:31.480]  asking you where did you see that okay npr heard it on the radio well the reason i thought of cnn
[28:31.480 --> 28:40.040]  is they're now announcing oh a panel of tops doctors say don't take mammograms from age 41 to 50
[28:40.040 --> 28:48.360]  uh no it's actually 40 to 49 because doctors say you might not need to but then i actually went
[28:48.360 --> 28:54.040]  and read the report they say it may be causing cancer see why won't cnn tell people why the
[28:54.040 --> 29:00.360]  doctors are saying watch out absolutely okay another point jumping around the preacher at my
[29:00.360 --> 29:06.760]  church sunday morning for veterans day uh i actually had a quote in his newsletter from
[29:06.760 --> 29:12.360]  woodrow wilson talking about the setting it up for armistice day and all in which i can't remember
[29:12.360 --> 29:23.320]  the exact quote but it had to do with the council of nations you mean he was brainwashing pro-new
[29:23.320 --> 29:29.560]  world order stuff you know what he's a brainwashed new world order puppet and he doesn't even know it

[32:53.800 --> 33:03.160]  on the web at www.ecoloblu.com today hi i'm jerry from science at new york i just got through
[33:03.160 --> 33:07.240]  a heated debate with a fellow citizen about the war on terry because he saw me wearing a shirt
[33:07.240 --> 33:12.280]  which calls for a new 9-11 event vacation after i verbally provided him with certain facts of the
[33:12.280 --> 33:18.360]  9-11 event his response to me was that if 9-11 wasn't inside job then it would be common knowledge
[33:18.360 --> 33:23.960]  therefore the information that i provided to him with was a farce according to him and thinking
[33:23.960 --> 33:29.560]  about our debate i'm starting to get a clear picture of how this 20 slash 21st century matrix
[33:29.560 --> 33:35.640]  works the matrix is the ability of the electronic media to create images for the people's minds
[33:35.640 --> 33:40.360]  that involve them and leaves no other perspective in which they can compare these images
[33:40.360 --> 33:45.720]  that i put out in a sophisticated way to make them believe that the reality they're being given
[33:45.720 --> 33:51.560]  through these images is the real reality and the other reality that is based on facts of events
[33:51.560 --> 33:57.320]  does no longer exist or is subsumed under the more dominant controlling symbols and images
[33:57.320 --> 34:02.760]  that constitutes the matrix in the conglomeration of all these images that one put together make
[34:02.760 --> 34:11.560]  up this new reality thank you for your time hey alex got a question as i drive into work this
[34:11.560 --> 34:17.480]  morning uh around indian naplice and a lot of other cities i've noticed every quarter of a mile
[34:18.120 --> 34:23.080]  there are cameras with little box sensors on them and i've done some investigation that they say
[34:23.080 --> 34:28.600]  it's for traffic monitoring and i'm sure that's true but i wonder what kind of strings are attached
[34:28.600 --> 34:32.840]  there that's one of the here you take on i've never heard you specifically address uh these
[34:32.840 --> 34:44.520]  interstate cameras that seem to be popping up everywhere thank you for your time man bye bye
[34:46.600 --> 34:52.360]  those are calls to the new listener comment line will take the best most focused questions and
[34:52.360 --> 34:57.480]  comments and rants and play them each day some days will play them every hour some days will play
[34:57.480 --> 35:03.160]  them once or twice a day sometimes i may do a whole hour where we play clip after clip because
[35:03.160 --> 35:12.600]  i love to hear from you and the different thought neuron cell synapses that fire in all our brains
[35:12.600 --> 35:16.280]  with the different points and angles that you bring up we're going back to your calls here in
[35:16.280 --> 35:21.880]  just a moment a great point about the control matrix on the gentleman's question about all the
[35:21.880 --> 35:29.880]  camera boxes going in it's all official mit has written major articles about it and mit
[35:29.880 --> 35:36.280]  magazine bragging that the pentagon 20 years ago or a little more than 20 years ago now
[35:36.920 --> 35:43.640]  designed what they call a control grid i didn't coin that term the pentagon did
[35:44.920 --> 35:51.160]  of cameras that read license plates cameras that store data everywhere you go they had this at
[35:51.160 --> 35:58.760]  least 20 years ago of face scanning cameras now they can get your heat resonance signature
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.840]  when you're at the dmv or at the airport or on the street because they can't get your heat
[36:04.840 --> 36:09.480]  resonance without being able to match it to your name so when so when the heat resonance
[36:09.480 --> 36:15.160]  cameras that are going up all over the world this is the secret weapon that was written about
[36:15.160 --> 36:23.880]  uh a year ago by woodworth bob woodward in his new book about iraq we said oh i won't tell you
[36:23.880 --> 36:31.240]  about the secret weapons but uh it's as big as the manhattan project and it deals with identifying
[36:31.240 --> 36:36.440]  people but it was already in the government documents already in the trade publications
[36:36.440 --> 36:42.040]  already in the research material 14 years ago when i really dove into all this full time
[36:42.040 --> 36:48.360]  and i've been warning people and warning people about the grid and there's hundreds of different
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.960]  systems that integrate together the private military industrial complex also makes huge
[36:53.960 --> 36:58.440]  profits while they're installing all of this i mean a very simple way to give you a window into
[36:58.440 --> 37:06.760]  this is more than 10 years ago i read articles about lockheed martin telling their stockholders
[37:06.760 --> 37:13.560]  that their big growth industry wouldn't just be new weapons systems and the maintenance of
[37:13.560 --> 37:18.920]  wet weapons systems but that it would be red light cameras face scanning cameras security systems
[37:22.600 --> 37:25.320]  that's just one example of the control grid
[37:27.800 --> 37:35.240]  and so all over the nation they first did it in texas indiana and california
[37:35.240 --> 37:44.440]  uh more than a decade ago face scanning cameras went in in select test areas in downtown bar
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.640]  districts uh in neighborhoods in public parks they they tested different systems the feds
[37:49.640 --> 37:54.600]  have tested in montana and colorado little cable systems in the middle of nowhere in the
[37:54.600 --> 38:00.840]  woods and mountains that have robotic trolley cameras that are only about two feet long one
[38:00.840 --> 38:06.280]  of the models i've seen that are wireless and then plug in at night and charge back up and then
[38:06.840 --> 38:12.680]  go back on these grids over hundreds of miles scanning and face scanning and tracking everyone
[38:12.680 --> 38:17.800]  i mean these are imperial probe droids again there's hundreds of these i could go over with you
[38:18.520 --> 38:27.000]  it's everywhere and we got another big window of this in 2003 when the governor of wisconsin
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.240]  told the green bay newspaper this is in my film matrix of evil the news article
[38:33.480 --> 38:37.480]  so i can't remember the exact headline i know it's in the film i gave a speech and mentioned
[38:37.480 --> 38:43.240]  it that's why it's in the film once you understand this is all on record and he said oh it's great
[38:43.240 --> 38:53.160]  the feds just put in this threat integration center and if the police want to look for a
[38:53.160 --> 38:57.960]  missing person or if the police want to know where you are they just type in your driver's license
[38:57.960 --> 39:03.480]  number your social security number in this great facility the feds just built in green bay and
[39:03.480 --> 39:09.800]  he mentioned several others for the state and they type your name and an id in and then it
[39:09.800 --> 39:15.560]  instantly on a map brings up your cell phone down to 15 feet under federal law they're actually
[39:15.560 --> 39:20.920]  accurate to three feet triangulated with gps off the cell towers the cell towers have the gps
[39:20.920 --> 39:25.880]  and they triangulate down to the cell phone that by federal law and the telecommunications act of
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.920]  96 have tracker chips at them and i would talk about this 12 years ago people laugh at me now
[39:30.920 --> 39:36.120]  they've announced it on the news let you know but the first place i saw it announced was 2003
[39:37.800 --> 39:42.200]  and the governor just admitted that everybody was being tracked in real time and even if your
[39:42.200 --> 39:51.320]  cell phones off they can turn it on without you knowing and listen to you via the audio sensor the
[39:51.320 --> 39:57.720]  audio pickup and they can also track everywhere you are so they incorporate the big brother into
[39:57.720 --> 40:05.080]  everything now all they do is they have the cameras integrated in to aware when and they're
[40:05.080 --> 40:08.520]  doing this to the entire population most of the populations already been picked up already been
[40:08.520 --> 40:16.680]  scanned the system integrates with the software identifies that that is you off your license
[40:16.680 --> 40:26.440]  plate or off your cell phone it then takes a body thermal scan the thermal scan is then integrated
[40:26.440 --> 40:33.000]  as your body's thermal biometric algorithm and they say it's 99.9 accurate and they're always
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.280]  telling us about stuff that's 10 to 15 years old and it just expands out from there my friends
[40:40.280 --> 40:48.280]  the airport scanners i remember nine years ago reading about Prada's clothing stores
[40:48.280 --> 40:54.360]  in a federal grant in new york and los angeles telling the trendies oh we have a new fitting
[40:54.360 --> 41:03.480]  system you step in to this chamber and it scans your body 360 and creates a perfect image of
[41:03.480 --> 41:13.880]  your body and then we have robotically controlled factories in china and the united states that
[41:13.880 --> 41:26.120]  then give you the perfect tailored dress or suit now that unit happens to be developed by the same
[41:26.120 --> 41:33.720]  group of companies that have in 200 plus airports in the u.s. now the body scanners you know that
[41:33.720 --> 41:37.480]  shows the naked image of people on the news when they show it to you and throw it in your face part
[41:37.480 --> 41:44.760]  of your indoctrination to accept this so when your family steps into those and of course most
[41:44.760 --> 41:50.040]  the foolish t.s. say people don't even know this it's all being recorded on hard drive it's all
[41:50.040 --> 41:55.560]  being databaseed and then now they don't just have your heat residence that's done with the cameras
[41:56.680 --> 42:05.960]  now they have your biometric body scan where even if you wear a mask now with these passive
[42:05.960 --> 42:10.600]  mri's that they're putting into the airports and train stations going nationwide they can
[42:10.600 --> 42:15.000]  scan right through your clothes and id you off that of course you know about the biometrics
[42:15.000 --> 42:29.560]  that deal with your walk your certain walk it's incredible that's the secret weapon
[42:29.560 --> 42:37.480]  so yes sir they're putting in independent power boxes and solar panel power boxes
[42:37.480 --> 42:42.840]  with wireless cameras and cabled cameras no expensive spared we confirm that many areas of
[42:42.840 --> 42:51.000]  the country have kill cables that can broadcast a frequency under federal law all cars and it's
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.640]  the same law in all the industrialized nations can when your car drives over to kills your car
[42:55.640 --> 43:00.760]  police helicopters are now being fitted in the biggest cities with a broadcast system that they
[43:00.760 --> 43:15.880]  aim at your car and it kills it a total grid is now in place a total and complete grid
[43:18.200 --> 43:23.720]  they go further i would talk about this 14 years ago because i'd seen federal documents that
[43:23.720 --> 43:28.760]  listeners sent me i've had us representatives on i've had representatives national representatives
[43:28.760 --> 43:34.040]  of australia on british representatives on just so if you'd hear it from them maybe you'd believe
[43:34.040 --> 43:42.280]  it now i don't have to have them on oh no about eight months ago i was still doing the sunday
[43:42.280 --> 43:45.960]  show out of news radio 590 kelby jay they still carry the show but i was doing the sunday show
[43:45.960 --> 43:53.480]  out of their studios syndicating and out of their studios and i heard uh sarah hüterberg great local
[43:54.360 --> 44:01.080]  news writer and broadcaster do the sunday news and she said everyone at berth in texas has their
[44:01.080 --> 44:06.360]  blood taken and it's done nationwide it's stored by the university of texas at san antonio and
[44:06.360 --> 44:12.200]  it's used in research for the human genome project and for a dna database and i came running out
[44:12.200 --> 44:17.560]  out we were about to go live in 30 seconds and i said who told you that how do you know that she
[44:17.560 --> 44:23.320]  said oh here's the statesman handed me the paper front page metro and state announcing it to everyone
[44:23.320 --> 44:31.720]  for 36 plus years everyone in the western world in a concerted standardized we've been under world
[44:31.720 --> 44:38.280]  government for a long time have had your blood taken at birth and dick cheney says it's for
[44:38.280 --> 44:44.840]  race specific bio weapons and that they need to be used source september 20 and 2000 rebuilding america's
[44:44.840 --> 44:55.160]  defenses richard cheney and i just can't believe this is happening i can't believe we're letting
[44:55.160 --> 45:00.600]  this happen i mean these people mean business so there i said i'm gonna take a lot of calls but i
[45:00.600 --> 45:06.280]  played that clip i wanted to answer you sir they rolled it out in the last 12 years or so to the
[45:06.280 --> 45:11.880]  public as oh you can go online or the local tv stations can get feeds of traffic isn't it great
[45:12.440 --> 45:18.680]  those are the big stationary wide shot cameras i talked to john hurt text dot official over a
[45:18.680 --> 45:22.120]  decade ago and he laughed i said aren't there a lot of other cameras we don't see and he said yes
[45:22.120 --> 45:28.440]  alex for every one camera you see there's nine cameras you don't that was in 1998 so i guess 11
[45:28.440 --> 45:35.560]  years ago and i've known this information i sit here reading government documents constantly
[45:35.560 --> 45:42.440]  totally freaking me out i love my family i love everybody it's horrible it's horrible they're
[45:42.440 --> 45:46.280]  they're putting poison in our water they admit they're doing that on purpose to brain damages and
[45:46.280 --> 45:53.800]  give us cancer i remember when i first got on air being sent government documents and research
[45:53.800 --> 45:58.920]  documents about how they knew that the high powered radiation with mammograms the way that it was
[45:58.920 --> 46:06.840]  tuned was giving women breast cancer and now it's mainstream news they know they know they're killing
[46:06.840 --> 46:12.120]  all of us you foolish government agents you foolish cops fbi people do you like your kids dying
[46:12.120 --> 46:18.520]  do you like your mama dying you like dying i mean this isn't a game boys you think i'm up here
[46:18.520 --> 46:23.640]  risking my life putting it all on the line for some ego trip no i'm telling the truth
[46:23.640 --> 46:33.560]  and i wish this was it true every day but it is true i'm going to go over that mammogram
[46:33.560 --> 46:36.760]  information later let's go to don in wisconsin don you're on the air
[46:38.520 --> 46:45.000]  yeah hey alex i want to talk about uh conditioning and brainwashing in movies for a little bit
[46:45.000 --> 46:52.440]  and uh specifically like stanley kubrick i want to get your opinion like whether he was an insider
[46:52.440 --> 46:59.720]  or he was or he was trying to expose the system he was a top he was a top insider and he refused
[46:59.720 --> 47:07.240]  this was confirmed even in variety he was he refused to cut 28 minutes it was 28 minutes
[47:08.200 --> 47:13.400]  if memory serves and it was over 20 it was 28 but you check it for yourself it was in variety
[47:13.960 --> 47:19.160]  i covered at the time he died the two days after he died on local radio and before i was even syndicated
[47:19.160 --> 47:22.520]  uh just started getting syndicated the point is i have to go back to memory so it's a memory path
[47:22.520 --> 47:28.280]  so i'll get a lot of useless info and i access those memory areas but the issue is kubrick
[47:30.040 --> 47:35.240]  said this movie is going to show you what's really going on they the he had final cut
[47:35.240 --> 47:40.280]  and he had an ironclad contract he had final cut on the film where he couldn't be controlled
[47:40.920 --> 47:46.840]  and he refused to cut it then the distributor threatened to not distribute it and then he
[47:46.840 --> 47:55.000]  died mysteriously and they cut the 20 plus minutes so yes kubrick total high-level insider total
[47:55.000 --> 48:02.120]  aluminist uh same thing with arthur c clark i mean you don't get any more high-powered than
[48:02.120 --> 48:08.360]  these people and uh they i i believe they killed him better than a hammer he was more like huxley
[48:08.360 --> 48:18.120]  than um uh orwell then he's and like like say in a full metal jacket when he's got jack key ripper
[48:18.120 --> 48:24.520]  talking about fluoride is that to belittle it and make uh people think that that's ridiculous to
[48:24.520 --> 48:32.120]  talk about fluoride that's dr strangelove yeah dr strangelove yeah yes that's exactly what it is
[48:32.120 --> 48:44.920]  yeah well i mean i mean last year i had the head of the epa union on a top doctor in toxicology
[48:44.920 --> 48:50.520]  over 90 of their scientists signed a letter saying take what is known as sodium fluoride out of the
[48:50.520 --> 48:56.840]  water that it's a catchall term for hundreds of toxic chemicals i mean 90 of the scientists
[48:56.840 --> 49:00.920]  don't don't want it or saying what are you doing but it doesn't matter oh there's a movie making fun
[49:00.920 --> 49:07.000]  of it just like woody harrelson i'm not saying he's a bad guy i know him well he's into fighting the
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.160]  new world order i'm sure he's not sophisticated enough to understand what happened to him they
[49:11.160 --> 49:15.800]  made him had him make all these fake youtube videos where he talks about the seed bank an
[49:15.800 --> 49:21.240]  axol crazy and says the the globalist have a un seed bank that's in associated press roiders
[49:21.240 --> 49:26.600]  but now when you talk about it they'll go oh that's wacky woody harrelson so see that's what
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.880]  they do with this and i and i watched one night hours of these he's made dozens and dozens of these
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.320]  five and ten minute and six and seven minute videos just go to the 2012 website on youtube
[49:37.320 --> 49:41.160]  what we'll play some today i've been meaning to do that i'm going to talk about 2012 that's in my
[49:41.160 --> 49:47.080]  i haven't seen it yet but i've read the script i was sent the script secretly by people involved
[49:47.080 --> 49:55.240]  with it but the point is i knew about it six months ago the the issue here is that that's how
[49:55.240 --> 50:01.800]  they have revelation of the method that's why they the cia approached the uh chris carter of the
[50:02.360 --> 50:05.720]  x-files loan government said we want you to make an episode about hijacked jet phone the
[50:05.720 --> 50:09.880]  world trade center is a pretext to attack afghanistan the government would would use a drill
[50:09.880 --> 50:15.480]  to make the rest of norad stand down i mean i had this from dean hagglen the the main star
[50:15.480 --> 50:22.520]  of the loan gunman x-files spinoff intervening the cia came to them and planted these stories
[50:22.520 --> 50:29.240]  and then now people say oh you just got that from the x-files right well let's let i heard you one
[50:29.240 --> 50:35.480]  time say that the director that mexican director of children of men was uh you know he was not part
[50:35.480 --> 50:41.640]  of that that movie he was trying to wake people up or something but when you watch that yes i know i
[50:41.640 --> 50:47.160]  know several producers and directors that know him and they say that's the case but what what's the
[50:47.160 --> 50:53.320]  difference you know i mean even it seems like it's predictive programming what if it was i agree
[50:53.320 --> 50:56.760]  with you you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't what does it do when i get up here
[50:56.760 --> 51:01.880]  and talk about all this at a certain level it acclimates people hey folks this is alex jones

[54:21.320 --> 54:25.880]  hour because he wrote an amazing analysis you know he's a doctorate in history and a doctorate
[54:25.880 --> 54:32.120]  in economics he understands false flag events and and the the way these synthetic events are
[54:32.120 --> 54:37.880]  crafted like no other he has done an analysis and believes the evidence points directly
[54:37.880 --> 54:43.080]  out of stage the vented ford hood we've kind of held our tongue on this while we analyze the
[54:43.080 --> 54:50.120]  situation and dr tarpoli concurs with my analysis it looks bad tarpoli is on in the last hour
[54:50.120 --> 54:55.080]  correct we did get him right i'm gonna have him on for 30 minutes but wide open phones uh for
[54:55.080 --> 55:00.520]  this segment a little bit of the next though once a month i like to have special sponsors on
[55:00.520 --> 55:05.000]  that are part of the solution and so i wanted to bring marty schachter world war two vet in the
[55:05.000 --> 55:10.440]  chemical core i think that's always interesting i'm going to do a project interviewing world war
[55:10.440 --> 55:15.800]  two vets because it's just it's a breed that's fading quickly but not not marty family owned
[55:16.840 --> 55:22.680]  high quality organic soap company uh that never sold directly to the public they sold

[55:27.960 --> 55:33.640]  they got a whole line of products you save 85 off supermarket prices and uh he got out of the
[55:33.640 --> 55:38.680]  chemical core and noticed that the new detergents they called soap or chemical weapons so him and

[1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:07.560]  one of the big ones is a health issue and i mentioned it last hour but i want to cover it
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:15.080]  more after we get to a couple of uh galleries of calls here seeing in task force opposes
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:23.560]  routine mammograms for women age 40 to 49 now i study this so in depth and my level of knowledge
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:29.240]  and i'm not someone who's wise will tell you how much they don't know it's just that it's like a
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:35.640]  brain boost or something knowing our enemy so well it's pure torture at certain times believe
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:40.360]  me the novelty of knowing what's really going on kind of wears off when you can't turn it off
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:45.880]  you can't not understand it's about 2 30 in the morning wake up can't go to sleep i'm in front
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:53.560]  of the computer headline task force opposes routine mammograms for women age 40 49 now i knew
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:04:00.920]  before i read it that they were never going to tell you that the task force opposes it because
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:07.400]  it can cause cancer the study show i already knew that a bunch of other major groups and
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:12.760]  universities and task forces had come out years ago years ago more than a decade ago
[1:04:13.480 --> 1:04:17.160]  and i knew when i read this article it wouldn't be in there i knew they would just say oh
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:23.400]  because that's not the global stop rate they lie by omission that's their favorite oh yeah you
[1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:29.400]  might not need those uh but some other doctors disagree and and and say the risk of cancer is
[1:04:29.400 --> 1:04:34.520]  great enough that you might want to do it but they don't tell you why they're saying don't do it
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:40.760]  that it can give you cancer that it can trigger cancer so i just googled the term mammograms
[1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:47.000]  cancer and hundreds of mainstream articles like this one mammograms can increase breast cancer risk
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:54.440]  the daily mail from june 27 2006 100 when i say hundreds there's actually thousands
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:59.080]  i'm just being conservative see singing in won't even tell women the truth

[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:49.240]  last hour to go over the evidence that fort hood was a staged event a drill that they used as a
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:56.280]  cover story just like they had a drill on april 19th 1995 to cover their operation their false
[1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:00.360]  flag bombing the government had drills running of the exact same targets being attacked at the
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:07.560]  exact same time on 9 11 to make norad get confused and stand down 7 7 the government contracted for
[1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:14.120]  a drill to be run that morning of the exact same bus and exact same trains to be attacked at the
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:20.280]  exact same stations at the exact same time in my film terror storm there's an actuary that was done
[1:09:20.840 --> 1:09:27.080]  the system they use for insurance calculations that it was what one out of 23 trectagillian
[1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:33.720]  that's trillions of times all the grains of sand in all the world and and by the way i'm not going
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:42.120]  to play the clips you can google peter power drill on youtube and you could see him on bbc
[1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:53.400]  on itn and on bbc radio and then on cbc he gave four different interviews in case people think
[1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:57.560]  he spoke incorrectly going oh it was quite incredible it was quite strange it was quite
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:01.960]  amazing in fact people won't believe it it's been years since i played it go to youtube and type in
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:10.600]  peter power peter power drills on 7 7 admits drills on 7 7 peter power admits drills on 7 7
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:16.760]  and there'll be bbc itn cbc and bbc radio just just just pick one of them he says the same thing
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:20.920]  because they were meant to throw it in everybody's face plus i don't believe he was involved in the
[1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:24.840]  attacks and i've been clear about that but when media has gone to talk to him about it after this
[1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:29.080]  at one speaking event he went and locked himself in a broom closet and hid for an hour and wouldn't
[1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:41.080]  come out well in that case he was at the uh at a public forum at the uh london school of economics
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:46.520]  he won't talk about it but obviously i don't think he was involved because he came right out he was
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:54.280]  the former head of scotland yard head spokesperson he came out and said oh uh it was quite eerie quite
[1:10:54.280 --> 1:10:59.960]  strange we were running the exact same drills at the exact same time and then it turned out they were
[1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:05.640]  with the metro with the underground now why would they do that here he is from
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:16.200]  itn national british television here it is an issue uh today we were running an exercise
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:20.360]  for a company bearing in mind i'm now in the private sector and we sat everybody down in the
[1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:24.920]  city a thousand people involved in the whole organization but the crisis team and the most
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:29.320]  peculiar thing was we based our scenario on the simultaneous attacks on the underground and main
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:35.080]  line station so we had to suddenly switch an exercise from fictional to real and one of the
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:40.680]  first things is get that bureau number when you have a list of people missing tell them and it took a
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:47.320]  long time just to get this right you were actually working today on an exercise that envisioned
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:51.800]  virtually this scenario almost precisely i was out until two o'clock this morning because it's our
[1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:56.600]  job my own company advisor consultants we specialize in helping people to get their crisis management
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:01.720]  response how do you jump from slow time thinking to quick time doing and we chose a scenario with
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:06.840]  their assistance which is based on a terrorist attack because they're very close to a property
[1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.920]  occupied by jewish businessmen they're in the city and there are more american banks in the city
[1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:15.640]  than there are in the whole of new york now there are several reasons the globalists do this
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:23.240]  they fund terror attacks through the drill funding that way of another agency that's compartmentalized
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:28.360]  and not involved in the attacks finds out about it if they catch the men planting bombs if the
[1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:33.560]  police would have stopped the four young arab men who we know were hired to take part in another
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:42.680]  drill to test security if anyone bust them or catches them oh it's just a drill
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:45.080]  well do you understand
[1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:53.720]  and also with info poll nine echelon the different snooping systems when different
[1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:57.720]  bureaus pick up on the chatter of a terror attack they stand down because they're told
[1:12:57.720 --> 1:13:03.240]  us just to drill second go on and on on these subjects the tarp was coming up the last hour
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.800]  to talk about for hood you want the inside skinny get ready ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:13.480]  going to be very informative call your friends and family please tell them to tune in right now so
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:22.600]  it just makes my head spin another they were running a drill at for hood that's been confirmed
[1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:27.560]  at the same time there is just no end to what these people do
[1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:33.960]  okay let's go ahead and i could play the clips of the drills on 911 if you'd like i mean i'm not
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:43.640]  making any of this up and the drill on april 19th on and on and on police doctors others showed up
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:49.480]  less than one minute after the alfred p murrow building got blown to bits and they asked the
[1:13:49.480 --> 1:13:54.360]  batf why are you in full bomb gear well how are you already here and one of them told the local
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:59.560]  doctor he said say that i was on the top floor and fell in the elevator and bandaged my leg and the
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:05.320]  doctor said i've got real people to help you're not hurt police officers noted this of course they
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:09.880]  got killed later tarence yakey got tortured to death he was publicly saying it was an inside
[1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:15.160]  job man they took him and tortured him something something fierce you can search the term tarence

[1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:20.440]  in pennsylvania in the allentown area anyway she started telling me that a lot of his business
[1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:28.440]  lately has been installing security systems on farms believe it or not they're installing cameras
[1:33:28.440 --> 1:33:38.040]  and security systems on chicken farms to protect the egg for future vaccine production i'm wondering
[1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:42.200]  what they're planning next that's all i got
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:55.720]  and here's another clip from the phone system yeah this might not be 60 seconds long
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:03.880]  mr. jones could you do america big favor and get some bumper stickers out there
[1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:13.000]  that says kick the bums out kick the bums out of the house and send let's just kick them out
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:19.720]  let's just kick them out they're not doing anything for their nation kick the bums out i
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:27.640]  think if we can get these circulated before midterm it's going to make a big big difference and it
[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:35.080]  might even um cause some of them some some of them to change their mode of thinking if not
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:41.640]  just go along with policy and kick the bums out but we need those bumper stickers we need slogans
[1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:48.120]  we need to just drape the whole united states flags and everything with these slogans kick
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:53.960]  the bums out kick the bums out of the house and send it let them know that we don't like them
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:59.640]  kick them out let them know that we we don't like to press cheating us robbing us of our
[1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:05.400]  intelligence and other facts what's going on with this nation kick the bums out
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:17.400]  thanks
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:23.640]  it's a great idea need to make up some flags that say throw the bums out
[1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:31.560]  on one side stop the new world order on the other info wars dot com okay let's continue with holly
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:38.280]  in new jersey what was your other question ma'am well um like i get medicaid because um like you
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:42.760]  know i can't really afford regular insurance and stuff and like i was wondering like what's
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:49.320]  gonna end up happening with that like it's kind of look i mean i'm gonna be honest with you it's a
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:59.960]  1,960 something page bill and so is the climate bill and so i've gone through the subsections
[1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:05.800]  basically what it does is it does set up the rationing panels that are called death panels
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:12.360]  it gives a 2.5 to 5 tax depending on your tax bracket then it also on top of that forces you
[1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:20.120]  to get insurance uh or there's prison time five years quarter million dollar fine and it waters
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:26.760]  down the type of care uh they are saying out of medicare and medicaid that in the next decade
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:30.920]  they're gonna save a trillion dollars and the question has been asked how are they gonna
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:35.880]  save a trillion dollars they're gonna increase taxes on everybody they can pay them and then
[1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:41.800]  for people that are supposedly getting the free health care uh they're going to cut your your
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:50.920]  your benefits and cut what you have access to and look that's why denise casinich i don't agree
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:56.440]  with denise casinich in his socialism but i really respecting because he went public for 911 truth
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:02.760]  he went public on halibut and dinecore torture and and and all the rest of it and he's a real
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:07.160]  socialist a real collectivist and he said this isn't collectivism this isn't socialism he's
[1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:12.120]  written editorials recall denise casinich why why i voted against a health care bill and he wrote
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:18.040]  another one denise casinich title a health care bill is a bailout for insurance companies they
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:23.080]  wrote it i mean i have a new york times article today but it kind of white washes it like it's a
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:28.600]  good thing that says oh the talking points for the republican and democratic leadership this
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:35.720]  is on the drudge report today of all places you know they're linked to it it was written by big
[1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:41.720]  pharma for both sides they would write talking points for both sides where and it says the
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:46.520]  republicans it has the talking points would be well this plan isn't all bad it's got some good
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:50.920]  provisions telling them this is how you can act like you're conservative and not get voted out but
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:58.040]  still let it pass okay this is our strategy because if you really fight it uh you can kill it so we'll
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:02.920]  still keep funding you just just come out and talk about you have a problem with it but it does have
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:09.160]  some good areas and this is all the new york times and then for the democrats oh this poor woman died
[1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:16.040]  she was waiting on health care it's it's all staged and so if we have a banker bailout if we have a
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:25.720]  bank re-regulation system if we have a health care plan anything they do will be used to rob us
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:32.920]  further and i appreciate your call they will package something as one thing they say zig they
[1:38:32.920 --> 1:38:41.800]  zag they say up they go down they say left they go right they say blue it's red they say green
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:49.880]  it's purple i mean it's just it's a tissue of lies it's a full spectrum dominance of propaganda
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:56.120]  and disinformation and throwing it in your face and spinning and lying by omission and just frothing
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:00.520]  from every angle but i know their tricks i know their angles i know their game plan i've seen them
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:04.600]  do it in other countries in this country and i i can look at it and i can read their language
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:10.760]  that's how we can tell you what's going to happen in the future because not only can i analyze their
[1:39:10.760 --> 1:39:15.160]  propaganda everything they're going to do is in white papers the white papers you never see on
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:19.960]  the news they all communicate with each other there's millions of these parasites there's
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:26.120]  six thousand superclass controllers now i already estimated that the controllers at five to six
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:31.560]  thousand roth cop the head of the kissinger group two years ago published a book called superclass
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:36.280]  the six thousand people that run the world and the whole books world government new world order
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:45.480]  and how they run it all six thousand people with millions of minions that are compartmentalized
[1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:49.160]  that have large pieces of it they just like the paychecks they're getting their mercenaries
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:56.040]  mercenary cops mercenary military mercenary politicians mercenary corporate chiefs mercenary
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:02.600]  bureaucrats mercenaries they don't care what their job does a society they lie to themselves
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:06.440]  there's interdepartmental propaganda to make everybody feel good about what they're part of
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:11.960]  and what they're doing it is sick and you can sit there and have them give you koolaid with
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:17.080]  societal cyanide in it and tell yourself it didn't pure death but i'm here to tell you it's bad

[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:05.240]  this southeastern ohio so heavily that half the time when the sun shines through you can't see the
[1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:10.760]  sun you only get the light terry you're not the pastor in ohio three and a half years ago that
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:15.320]  sent me the secret fema documents about the clergy response teams and how the preachers were all
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:22.040]  being hired by the tens of thousands oh wow i've been wanting to now now now this happened to two
[1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:29.160]  preachers one from arkansas one from ohio you're the guy that got the fema visit uh actually got
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:35.000]  uh the fema papers maybe one of the i mean it's so long ago but one of the other pastors
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:41.320]  got got uh got a visit by fema and and was also part time a chaplain at the hospital and got
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:47.880]  kicked out of there was that you know no okay well for those that don't know what was that three and
[1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:55.640]  a half years ago yes or three years okay uh you sent me those documents people didn't believe them
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:02.040]  and then what was it like for you two years later to see mainstream news admit everything you'd said
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:06.520]  but oh the preachers are training to help you go to camps oh the preachers are training you to help
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:11.640]  turn your guns in the preachers are going to be here during martial law and for anyone that denies
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:18.440]  it just google clergy response teams you'll get mainstream tv newscast i mean again this would
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:24.280]  be like if they resurrected hitler and said how hitler we love him we know what tyranny is we
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:32.520]  know what it is well i mentioned uh when i they would have had me except for one thing
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:41.800]  is when we started the church the lord laid on my heart not to go and become 501c3 so we
[1:42:41.800 --> 1:42:48.120]  chose as a church not to do it and i told the people right up front hey look if you're coming
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:51.720]  here to give your money your tides and your offerings just so you can ride them off on your
[1:42:51.720 --> 1:42:56.200]  taxes you might as well go to the one on down the road because you're not going to be able to do that
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:06.040]  here and uh we lost about 60 families but uh that's all right um but the chem trails around
[1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:13.720]  here are just but just unbelievable what is it like for you to talk about chem trails and
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:18.520]  know their spring is the scientists we've interviewed that have tested them so they were barium salts
[1:43:18.520 --> 1:43:25.240]  aluminum dioxide it's all denied and then nine months ago ten months ago the new white house
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:31.400]  science czar john p holdren comes out in his first press conference and says we are controlling the
[1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:37.640]  weather we've done a study so far with barium salts aluminum dioxide now we're about to go to the full
[1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:43.400]  project and then to have china and ap and afp admitting they totally control their weather
[1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:49.720]  russia does you go shaves does but even though he's admitted they're spraying us when you talk
[1:43:49.720 --> 1:43:58.920]  about it you get called a cook well not only that but i was part of a pastor's association to where
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:03.640]  we all get together as a group so we can get cut rates on our insurance and things like that
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:11.800]  i was because i was relaying this information to other pastors giving them the documented proof
[1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:19.080]  because everything that you have said you always give where to go to get it well that's what i did
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:25.000]  so i would have documented proof to show the other pastors and reverends and all whatever they all
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:31.960]  want to call themselves but i would show them that and even though you had it right in their
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:42.200]  face you had all the documents that the letterhead everything they still deny i mean it's like they
[1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:48.040]  are so blind well this is how it works though at first if they hadn't been approached yet now they've
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:53.320]  they double the program each year so it's well over 60 000 right now that we know of that that
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:59.240]  that number's about a year and a half old so it's probably 120 000 they go to the bigger preachers first
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:06.120]  people know that's well let me just finish people know that's tyranny they know secret fema
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:11.800]  brainwashing of preachers telling them we're gonna pay you to go tell your flock to submit to tyranny
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:18.280]  people know that's hardcore red dawn level evil but once it got announced nationally suddenly
[1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:23.720]  i've seen preachers defending it preachers on the news saying how suddenly oh yeah it's good
[1:45:23.720 --> 1:45:28.680]  i'm telling you go to the fema camp but then glenn beck says the fema camps don't exist fema's
[1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:33.880]  just publicly teaching preachers to tell people to go to the fema camp when they're told see how
[1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:39.800]  this is just pure delusion well you want to hear something better and you probably don't know this
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:47.400]  but i got this information from those that i am affiliated with depending upon the size of your
[1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:53.480]  church you can get upwards to three thousand dollars a month that you don't have to report
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:59.880]  claim or anything else and that's where you have all these churches going through their
[1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:06.120]  building they're getting new vans they're getting jumbo tv's all they've got to do is say submit
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:11.000]  to government take the shots don't be involved politically the local baptist churches in austin
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:15.880]  hand out hand out sing don't even talk about politics if you go to eat lunch after church
[1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:21.480]  you are to the the the new bible is about submitting to government worshiping government
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:26.440]  this is what hitler did it's what the chinese communists did yes uh but if you've gotten new
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:31.400]  documents please send them to us but i do know that under the faith-based initiative which obama
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:35.800]  by the way is continuing they're buying off the churches again land of the free home of the brave
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:43.560]  a secret program buying off all the major tv a secret program buying off all the major churches
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:50.600]  a secret program and then now it's all public all public i mean think about the magnitude of this but
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:56.760]  because they denied it at first it's not polite to talk about it well yeah my preachers on secret
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:47:06.440]  payroll of fema that's not creepy anything else yes sir i talked to the the police on a pretty
[1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:15.000]  regular basis in the town that i'm from and they i just this recently just this past uh week i had
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:24.280]  a conversation with a lieutenant and very his comment was is this they get visited by uh homeland
[1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:31.480]  security or a representative from them once a month to get updates yes under the federal grants
[1:47:32.360 --> 1:47:36.280]  they are telling the local counties under the name of emergency management everything they've
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:43.800]  got to do the police are being totally federalized and they also the the here's the most ironic part
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:50.440]  about it all and talking to him i began to share with him since i'm a vietnam vet began to share
[1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:59.480]  with him about oath keepers well he knew nothing at all about oath keepers but they know everything
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:06.760]  about you when you come on because as soon as i mentioned well you need to listen to alex jones
[1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:12.520]  and i gave him how to get on and what to do and and the times you come on i give him all that
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:22.360]  information they knew he knew everything they they are letting all of them know about you and what you
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:31.000]  talk about and things like that and they give them information on how to actually talk and
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:38.840]  convince themselves that what you are laying over your program is not all true all right let's stop
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:45.320]  there i've seen the manuals it's called kernel of truth and they again they understand and i hate
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:49.800]  to admit this on there because it's very dangerous but they already know it so why not just admit it
[1:48:50.360 --> 1:48:57.080]  they understand for whatever reason this country boy from texas has got their number i see right
[1:48:57.080 --> 1:49:02.920]  through him on every point it's a nightmare to actually be able to see it's it's it's it's i mean

[1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:10.520]  the global controllers are scared to death that you're going to educate the police
[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:15.720]  the new world order spent a lot of time slowly twisting them slowly bringing them over to the
[1:54:15.720 --> 1:54:22.520]  dark side slowly teaching them that evil is good and good as evil it's not going well for them
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:28.440]  a lot of police have woken up because they said yeah we used to listen to you because you know it
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:33.720]  was entertaining but a lot of us bought gold five six years ago and have quadrupled our money we really
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:40.040]  like you i mean think about it on every issue on every front we're right we're right we're right
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:46.040]  we're right we're right because this is what i do i mean i found out that you and wanted to take
[1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:51.320]  over my country sovereignty and set up a police state 16 years ago and i got involved and two
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:56.840]  years later i was on the radio and tv locally in austin and two years after that i was syndicated
[1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:02.600]  because there was still some freedom left but let me tell you the shadows are getting along
[1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:07.400]  the sun is setting on the republic and freedom and there's not time to screw around
[1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:11.000]  them but it is bone chilling
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:19.960]  to know that homeland security has got my number i know everything i do is surveilled
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:24.520]  i know everything i do is watched it's even come out in federal court before i know they've
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:29.400]  got top nazis that go after me they control that's come out in federal court they've got the fake
[1:55:29.400 --> 1:55:35.880]  left george soros coming after me and i'm forced to talk about this more and more because i mean
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:43.000]  this is serious and whatever they do to me they're the criminals whatever they however they set me
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:50.280]  up or whatever they do to me that's their issue and they got a deal with god on that and the only
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:53.640]  reason they haven't smashed me flattered in a pancake is they've tried to destroy me other
[1:55:53.640 --> 1:56:00.280]  ways they've had some success i'm almost kind of glad oh i'm glad you've been effective at some
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:07.400]  levels because i'm not perfect either because the flesh in me says oh well you know maybe let
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:14.920]  them tear me up a bit i'll and maybe i subconsciously clown around sometimes because i think that'll
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:19.640]  protect me i mean later in hindsight i realized that but then i get more and more focused more
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:26.040]  and more serious more and more penetrating and they don't like it and people know i'm for real
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:31.720]  they know this radio shows for real warts and all and the globalists don't like it because it's
[1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:39.320]  authentic more than anything it's authentic and we know what's going on and no one is immune
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:43.720]  from this and i and i'm a fighter like any other normal man who's got his head screwed on half
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:47.880]  straight when a bunch of criminals try to come down on me and my family in my country i fight them
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:53.080]  and i don't buy their propaganda their lies i don't buy into their disinfo i'm i'm a free man
[1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:59.880]  and my mind is free but finishing up uh terry in ohio or i remembered his voice he's one of the
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:04.280]  pastors that gave us the secret fema documents now national news years later confirmed just like we
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:08.520]  get myac reports and homeland security reports demonizing veterans and patriots and gun owners
[1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:14.280]  from police and federal marshals and others we get a lot of key info from people like uh
[1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:17.960]  like terry terry we got about a minute left a minute and a half left finish up your point
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:22.280]  uh because you know you're telling them hey you're going to be judged by god and all of this
[1:57:22.840 --> 1:57:28.600]  they're going to be judged by more than that to the world they're helping toxify our society as
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:32.840]  they're being turned into secret police and i'd be careful if this guy isn't just trying to
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:38.680]  set you up or analyze you or act like he's your friend a lot of these guys are like dogs i mean
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:43.000]  that a nice way they're trained to go out and grab ducks and you're nothing but a duck to him
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:47.720]  but you've got discernment i mean do you think he's really reaching out to you well you know my wife
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:55.720]  made us that same comment when i come back in and told her to a conversation but one thing i i gotta
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:58:05.240]  tell you alex you are a watchman and and you're not the only one and as a watchman you know whether
[1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:10.440]  you want to be or you don't want to be i mean it's just like with me you know i really didn't want
[1:58:10.440 --> 1:58:15.080]  to get into the past that i was making good money but then when god called me into it well here i am
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:21.400]  but as a watchman you know god puts us out there to warn the people to let them know what's going
[1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:29.800]  on and as a watchman you stand with a sword in one hand and the bible with the information in the
[1:58:29.800 --> 1:58:36.120]  other hand and you being a watchman that's where you stand and the thing about it is is if you

[2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:43.240]  of what happened at ford hood a few weeks ago he says it looks like an inside job false flag
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:50.040]  op with a drill they were running that's coming up with dr tarbley towards the end of the last
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:53.880]  hour i'm going to play some clips from the watchman movie i saw it a few months ago in theaters i
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:01:00.600]  got the dvd i want to show you a clip at the end of the film where the luciferian character
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:06.760]  stages a terror attack worldwide to bring in world government to save everyone to end war
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:13.240]  war and dr manhattan the new god man the illuminati believes they're building towards
[2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:21.080]  he then understands and thanks these previous bad guy for staging the terror attacks it's
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:25.400]  total illuminati revelation of the method in your face that's coming up at the end of the
[2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:32.120]  broadcast today i'm going to break that down right now let's go back quickly to terry i've had
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:37.240]  terry on for several segments because i hadn't talked to him in a long time i guess he got through
[2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:42.280]  he's one of the passers that sent me the secret fema clergy response team documents right at two
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:45.960]  years before it broke mainstream news people couldn't believe it that they were secretly
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:51.000]  recruiting the preachers and yes i do feel like i am a watchman at the gates this huge armies
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  marching up they're battering down the door traders inside the castle are opening the drawbridge
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:01.240]  and i'm telling the lazy population hey we're being overrun here and they're saying shut up
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:07.960]  conspiracy theorist as flaming arrows come over the parapets uh and you were saying if you kill
[2:02:07.960 --> 2:02:16.120]  the watchman go ahead if you kill the watchman the people become aware and they become um
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:23.800]  ready ready to ready to fight so what always happens is they always they never usually go for
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:29.560]  the watchman himself because he's the lookout he stands out above everyone else they always go
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:36.440]  for those who are around him to cause he himself to step away from what he's doing exactly that's
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:43.480]  predatory logic that's like lions and tigers and other wolves coyotes go after the weak sheep or the
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:50.280]  weak deer or the weak gazelle because if you if you shoot the head blackbird the one that
[2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:55.160]  is the leader that takes off first and they all copy him they'll all fly away but if you sit there
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:03:01.800]  whacking uh the uh the the birds in the back nothing happens i mean i i've likened it to the new
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:07.960]  world order is hunting us and they want to bring us all down incrementally and i'm like a five point
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:14.680]  buck coming out into the field and if they shoot me i'm chasing after a doe if they shoot me that
[2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:21.320]  big 20 point uh you know giant freak of nature that big 20 point he's not going to come out that
[2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:27.960]  20 point is the entire population and so very good point sir and the other thing i wanted to
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:34.600]  point out to you alex is regardless of who they go after under you don't lose your focus as a
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:40.520]  watchman because as a watchman you are letting the people know and so are the rest of us letting
[2:03:40.520 --> 2:03:47.720]  the people know what's going on and and that is all done by design by god and i just i don't want
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:54.280]  to hold anybody up but in the net mainstream news i mean more and more you see it on the news
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:59.960]  every time they have a police or chasing someone to get to the houses whatever everyone is in
[2:03:59.960 --> 2:04:06.280]  in uh in jungle garb you know using military uniforms they're acclimating us to to the same
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:12.760]  uniforms yes and i also want to mention i sent you an email on this about the continental congress
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:20.920]  it started on november 11th it's in session for 21 days in elenoise nobody nobody is even talking
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:25.160]  about well we've talked about it a few times and i'm and i'm not poo pooing and i mean it's a good
[2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:29.320]  group to focus and come up with ideas and i appreciate your call it's good to hear from you my friend
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:37.080]  it's just that the continental congress was the leaders of the 13 colonies so there were 13 governors
[2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:43.640]  or 13 legislative heads meetings saying they were seceding from the union believe me we'd be covering
[2:04:43.640 --> 2:04:52.200]  it it's just uh it's kind of like the republic of texas 12 13 14 years ago just declaring themselves
[2:04:52.200 --> 2:04:57.640]  president right off the bat no you go to the legislature and do that and texas does have a
[2:04:57.640 --> 2:05:04.120]  right to secede we'll be right back the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:08.440]  even the food they want you to eat will you continue to be their profit center buying their

[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:03.320]  a drill and the evidence shows that is the case so that's coming up later in the last hour also my
[2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:09.640]  review of the watchman i saw it a few months ago in the theater i now have the dvd i'm going to play
[2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:16.520]  a few minutes of it from the end where this secret society stages terror attacks worldwide
[2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:25.480]  to then bring in a world government for world peace and dr manhattan the good guy decides oh i see
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:29.880]  i love it that you nuked a bunch of cities and killed a bunch of people that's loving
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:37.080]  the end justifies the means so massively evil total luminati programming but this will give
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:42.120]  you an idea of their mindset as they give the public the revelation of the method but as i walk
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:46.600]  out of the theater people all around were saying i don't get it i don't understand and all these
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:52.600]  editorials and all these articles said no one gets the watchman no one understands it it's clear
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:09:57.800]  in your face a five-year-old should be able to understand this but people have a compulsion to
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:06.440]  not see the truth so that is coming up also imf head eyes global currency change presses on yawn
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:11.800]  so they're now moving away from the dollar this is going to be devastating you think the economy
[2:10:11.800 --> 2:10:17.080]  is bad with really over 20 unemployment government says over 10 all the big mainline economists say
[2:10:17.080 --> 2:10:22.600]  over 20 you ain't seen nothing yet it can all stop if we remove the new world order bankers i'm
[2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:29.400]  identifying them not the liberals not the conservatives not their puppets but phase one
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:34.360]  in ending the fed removing the economic dictatorship is first shattering the left right
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:39.880]  paradigm so people understand that republicans come and go but the eugenics empire run by the
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:45.800]  big banks the eco science system that the white house science are talks about remains the same
[2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:56.040]  but i did want to have a bit of a light moment here on air today in my hand i'm holding a new
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:11:01.880]  form of toilet paper and in the last decade or so i've seen republicans and conservatives and
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:08.120]  libertarians put out paper that has the united nations symbol on it and i've seen them put it
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:13.800]  out that has democrats on it or i've seen the liberals put out toilet paper that has george
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:21.400]  bush on it but we're now seeing a bellwether of toilet paper selling all over the internet
[2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:32.840]  that does have bank pork frank fraud dodd bankster paulsey polosi greedy read
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:44.840]  bangster buddy obama beltway backroom biden but then it says sec no evil cox mcpork mccain
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:57.000]  alan fraud scam ben bankster buddy bailout brnacky kaching cheney bankster buddy bush the moron
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:03.080]  one it's bipartisan toilet paper i remember years ago saying we need toilet paper
[2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:07.160]  because they do take themselves a little too seriously this is from
[2:12:08.200 --> 2:12:17.400]  bankster buster dot com we want to thank dave for sending this this i was sent two rolls
[2:12:18.040 --> 2:12:24.200]  we will use this in the office back today we'll go put these on the rolls and you guys are happy
[2:12:24.200 --> 2:12:31.480]  with it and uh here we are but it is a bellwether people are getting it and i went and looked at
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:35.560]  for us all this is born and there's lots of brands of bipartisan toilet paper throw the
[2:12:35.560 --> 2:12:40.520]  bums out they're all puppets except for people like ron paul who transcend the left right paradigm
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:46.200]  and point out the real power structure stuff like anna nicole smith isn't what's important
[2:12:46.200 --> 2:12:55.160]  or oj simpson this is what is important shattering the left right paradigm so uh very very very
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:13:04.040]  very exciting i need to sneeze maybe i should use it as a as a tissue okay thought i'd have a little
[2:13:04.040 --> 2:13:15.480]  bit of fun there let's now go ahead and get into a news blitz here and then back to jim jerry steve
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:25.560]  gabe mike and others that are patiently holding uh paul watson wrote a story about this but it's in
[2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:34.200]  the bbc it's in the surrey newspaper it's all over the british news and they are reporting it
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:44.040]  like it is a good thing guilty paul clark faces at least five years in prison that's the minimum
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:53.320]  sentence for handing in a discarded shotgun this is out of the surrey newspaper you guys printed
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:58.600]  me a printer version can i have the actual official versions people can see the the letterhead and the
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:02.760]  news article they don't tend to believe it unless it's from an official letterhead however this
[2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:07.560]  printed it in print right but you can also read a story that gives you a larger perspective on this
[2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:17.640]  at prisonplanet.com written by paul joseph watson and it says in his backyard he saw a black shotgun
[2:14:18.280 --> 2:14:22.920]  should he call the police he's a military veteran no criminal record see you served him that's why
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:26.840]  they don't like you that's who they're worried about you've served them now now they want to give
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:31.640]  you a record and he calls the police department and says i'm going to bring this gun down to you
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:37.960]  and they were waiting for him and they said touching a gun is illegal the jury was instructed to
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:45.480]  convict him being total 1984 puppets that would make hitler proud and stalling proud and now as
[2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:53.880]  well they have a quote in here by the prosecutor brian stulk explained to the jury that possession
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:59.480]  of a farm was a strict liability charge see it's it's this term there's the actual article surrey
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:07.800]  today one of many that's what zero tolerance is about it's about targeting the mainstream targeting
[2:15:07.800 --> 2:15:14.920]  people that are good to terrorize them that's the essence of their mind control he said therefore
[2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:20.280]  mr clark's allegedly honest intent was irrelevant just by having the gun in his possession he was
[2:15:20.280 --> 2:15:25.800]  guilty of the charge and has no defense in law against it he had it but despite this mr black
[2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:29.880]  man urge members of the jury to consider how they would respond if they found the gun he says this is
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:37.400]  a very small case with a very big principle so they're saying they're making an example out of him
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:45.160]  and he'll be sentenced december 11 the minimum sentence is five years in prison and a hefty fine
[2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:50.520]  go read the articles at prisonplanet.com we have links to the article we wrote our own story about
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:55.320]  it and added the articles of where people defend themselves with a knife when they're being attacked
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:02.520]  in their house they get thrown in prison the the the rapist gets released we are the milk cows we
[2:16:02.520 --> 2:16:10.760]  are the slaves we are the aphids that the ants keep basically milk and the message is you don't
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:17.400]  touch a gun and it's meant to be absurdist it's meant to be over the top it's meant to shock us
[2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:24.920]  and train us to accept even more corruption and evil it's like this army enlisted lady who had
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:28.600]  a baby and they cps didn't say you're not allowed to have babies while you're in the military we're
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:34.680]  cpsing your baby and you're going back to afghanistan no other government's ever done that the soviets
[2:16:34.680 --> 2:16:39.000]  didn't do that the nazis didn't do that the israelis don't do that the cubans don't do that the
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:45.080]  germans don't do that the british don't do that it's absurd it's like england announcing in many
[2:16:45.080 --> 2:16:49.960]  cities you've got to have a license to be outdoors with your kid and be certified by the government
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:54.360]  that you're allowed to be with your child in public because you may be a pedophile guilty
[2:16:54.360 --> 2:16:59.240]  until proven innocent everything for the children but then real pedophiles and the un who've been
[2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:05.320]  caught running giant child kidnapping rings they don't get in trouble you see how they're training
[2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:13.880]  you to just accept unbelievably ridiculous things you understand how and why this is being done do
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:22.920]  you understand what this larger system is really all about i mean are you ready to understand that
[2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:28.360]  you're being conditioned and trained to accept more and more it's like what happened two months ago
[2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:35.240]  at the g20 one of the activists was using twitter when the police went down to the university park
[2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:40.520]  most people weren't even protesting it was a friday night i had three reporters there one of them
[2:17:40.520 --> 2:17:46.760]  got arrested rob do got arrested bermus barely made it out bermus was i told bermus that night he
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:51.640]  called me i said they're encircling the park they're gonna arrest everybody get out now jason
[2:17:51.640 --> 2:17:56.280]  listened to me i couldn't get a hold of do was there with the mainstream media they let them out
[2:17:56.280 --> 2:18:00.680]  but arrested him then put a bunch of false charges on him that we're now beating in court
[2:18:00.680 --> 2:18:05.160]  they even got the wrong day of his arrest in and we have video of what happened they didn't
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:10.440]  erase the tapes thank god they did erase some people's tapes they beat up and tortured lucredoski
[2:18:10.440 --> 2:18:18.600]  had the military do it in a state prison i mean it was hellish for him but why did they
[2:18:18.600 --> 2:18:24.040]  they in broad daylight on the wednesday before that friday two days before why did they go around
[2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:28.680]  with loudspeakers blaring no one's allowed on the streets of pittsburgh why did they drive up and
[2:18:28.680 --> 2:18:34.360]  hit with sound cannons uh nine-year-old kids with with their footballs in their front yards why did
[2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:39.480]  we have video of them driving around neighborhoods why did they use police dogs old ladies came out
[2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:45.000]  of a store with bags and we're like officer what's wrong get the bleep out of here lady releases the
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:50.440]  dogs to bite them they would chase down because they couldn't find anybody who was violating the
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:54.680]  curfew to not be on the streets day or night and was all randomly enforced so they went to the
[2:18:54.680 --> 2:18:58.760]  university where the college kids were and and girls would run on bikes and the police would
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:02.840]  run up each showed the video and knock them off and then beat them with blood spewing out of their
[2:19:02.840 --> 2:19:10.120]  heads and the cops are like what you don't like law enforcement coming so all of this
[2:19:10.120 --> 2:19:18.520]  is going on all of this is happening it's meant to be absurd it's meant to be over the top it's
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:23.160]  meant to be why are police dogs biting old ladies why are police dogs in public schools with the
[2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:28.760]  kids lined up in random searches biting and ripping the bags open why are they tasering old women and
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:33.400]  and pregnant women who ask why they have to you know sign a ticket or argue and say they weren't
[2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:39.640]  speeding why are they arresting a veteran who brings a shotgun in they'll call them and say
[2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:43.720]  I got a shotgun and they're waiting to pounce on him saying you're not allowed to touch it
[2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:48.040]  they want to train you to just be paralyzed and go I'll do whatever you say I'll do whatever
[2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:54.920]  you say and they admit we're making an example out of you that's why people will bring Dixie
[2:19:54.920 --> 2:19:59.640]  cups and and knives to school to have a pie and they'll arrest them saying they had knives

[2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:18.200]  gambler understands
[2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:26.680]  okay i just spent about 10 minutes on one article and as you can see i've probably got 20 or more
[2:25:26.680 --> 2:25:39.640]  here in the stack into a rush limbaugh imitation that's the audio version of holding up the stack
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:47.320]  on tv let me try to go through this as quickly as possible but each one of these is just so important
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:56.440]  task force opposes routine mammograms for women ages 40 to 49
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:04.840]  now again it's not just what i'm about to cover it's the understanding of these people and you
[2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:10.840]  couldn't get the same understanding when i i know cnn's flavor a poison and i knew when i read this
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:15.960]  i already knew this report was issued because of all the other big reports by prestigious scientific
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:21.240]  organizations that aren't compartmentalized and have good scientists in them that mammograms have
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:28.280]  been conclusively linked for more than a decade to the early onset of particularly aggressive
[2:26:28.280 --> 2:26:39.560]  breast cancers malignant tumors and i knew when i read it it was going to be a whitewash because
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:44.360]  lately there's been a bunch of news out where they're admitting you shouldn't get mammograms until
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:50.760]  you're above the age of 50 because the danger of cancer from the mammograms outweighs the danger of
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:55.720]  getting cancer normally and that's a whole other subject of the hormones in the food and the water
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:27:01.080]  the same hormones that feminized men over feminized women causing hormonal imbalances
[2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:07.480]  soy fluoride mercury uh you know the list goes on and on so it's not just mammograms giving you
[2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:12.280]  cancer it's not just cell phones increasing brain cancer though it's now completely confirmed
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:17.560]  and it turns out in 1981 when they were certifying the latest cell phone technologies that they knew
[2:27:17.560 --> 2:27:23.960]  then the internal telephone companies and and and technology companies that developed it they knew
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:28.360]  just like they knew prozac made people commit suicide and go nuts homicidal mania
[2:27:30.200 --> 2:27:33.880]  but but the you know there's several articles here there's several points i knew what it was
[2:27:33.880 --> 2:27:40.520]  going to say for i read it and i read and it said oh yeah they're saying they still recommend it for
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:48.360]  women 50 to 74 but they don't recommend it for women 40 to 49 but they don't say why it's recommended
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:55.480]  well i just put in the search box mammogram cancer risk and got hundreds and hundreds of articles
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:59.400]  i i quit looking after about 30 minutes i had more research to do couldn't sleep
[2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:05.960]  wanting to uh fight the new world order
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:13.080]  and the first article popped up i just printed one you can go read hundreds if you'd like
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:21.560]  read the studies mammograms can increase breast cancer risk here's the mail online 2006 major newspaper
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:29.240]  and uh natural news had an article mammograms offer no health benefits whatsoever doctors
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:34.440]  conclude and then they have all the links to the actual studies an increase in breast cancer
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:39.800]  in study after study you can go to this article it's the best one i found that had a boil down
[2:28:39.800 --> 2:28:43.640]  i like natural news because they're similar to us and that they do articles that are just every
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:49.800]  line is links every line is links to documents i just love that i just love ramming that down

[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:11.240]  hey alex how you doing good i uh as i was traveling in here i commute in uh from pennsylvania
[2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:18.680]  down to maryland down the uh corridor there i 270 and uh i've been traveling this for probably 20
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:24.680]  something years but i've noticed over the years especially just this past year since obama got
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:32.520]  in they've been doing all these bridge work and road work um that's part of the economic stimulus
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:37.880]  package it's a payoff to the local constabulary but it was also needed yeah well for every 30
[2:41:37.880 --> 2:41:42.520]  dollars given to the banks one dollar was given to infrastructure but at least something happened
[2:41:42.520 --> 2:41:47.480]  at least a blind hog does find an acre and occasionally this sign jumped out at me this
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:52.120]  morning i've seen these things going in that they're near truck weigh station and it always tells
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:58.120]  you look for terrorists look for an old lady who's lost right it says electronic screening site
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  they put these things up over the road and i thought they were cameras at first but um i believe
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:13.160]  they're they're more of a rfi d type reader yeah no they're they're they're reading trucks gps and
[2:42:13.160 --> 2:42:19.720]  their barcode transponders transceivers they're also different systems are reading your license plate
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:25.240]  right but it seems like that the improvements that they're doing on the highway it's more like a
[2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:34.680]  cattle shoot it's there's there is no it it it's lockdown could become lockdown very easily very
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:41.080]  all over the country they're putting cable barriers up on i-37 going to corpus christy everywhere
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:46.200]  they're just and they admit it's to control us no what would a criminal group do that sees
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:49.960]  the banking system in the government and was robbing everyone they would put in a police
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:56.360]  state to protect themselves that's all this is right exactly exactly and you're you know you're
[2:42:56.360 --> 2:43:01.720]  right on you're nailing it right on the head with the with the control grid that's just part of it
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:07.880]  so that's what prompted my call but um the pastor was on a while ago talking to you um and i was
[2:43:07.880 --> 2:43:13.800]  looking right when he got on there i was looking at the same verse that executable 33 6 it says
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:18.760]  about you being the watchman you know i consider you a watchman but if the watchman sees the sword
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:25.640]  come and blow not the trumpets and the people will be not warned if the sword come and take any
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:30.760]  person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but the blood will i require it to watch
[2:43:30.760 --> 2:43:37.000]  him say it i i believe your hands are clean alex you know and i wholeheartedly uh support what
[2:43:37.000 --> 2:43:46.680]  you're doing uh just uh keep it up well thank you sir god bless you yeah i didn't know what i was
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:51.320]  getting into 16 years ago 14 years ago on air i mean i knew there were big banks and they were
[2:43:51.320 --> 2:43:56.280]  corrupt and there was a new world order but it was still off in the distance and you know i did
[2:43:56.280 --> 2:44:01.880]  original research and read a lot of the people's good original research and but then in the late
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:06.840]  90s it started coming out in mainstream news that the un runs giant child kidnapping rings and i was
[2:44:06.840 --> 2:44:12.760]  like what and then i saw congressional hearings in 2002 where they admitted dinecore does this and
[2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:18.840]  they don't get in trouble and rumsfeld said they're allowed to and laughed about it it's like they're
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:23.800]  crushing us with evil they're flaunting it those of us in the know they're terrorizing us and
[2:44:23.800 --> 2:44:28.040]  everybody else they're just searing their conscience where we're trained to put up with anything
[2:44:29.640 --> 2:44:33.480]  and then all the other stuff they do and and the globalist you talk to them you're like well
[2:44:33.480 --> 2:44:36.600]  there is population reduction going on they go well what are you going to do for the earth
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:44.200]  and it's creepy
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:51.240]  to know they're on my tail and coming at me at from every angle
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:44:58.680]  but it's really creepy to know i could be taken out of the game that's all i want to stay in the
[2:44:58.680 --> 2:45:06.040]  game i want to get better i i i want to be a better radio host i want to tell the truth i i want to
[2:45:06.040 --> 2:45:11.320]  be more accurate i want to make sure i cover all the angles for people i want to be a good father
[2:45:11.320 --> 2:45:18.280]  i want to be a good husband i want to be good to my crew i want to at the same time enjoy life
[2:45:18.280 --> 2:45:21.800]  and be able to see things i have a wanderlust but i can't enjoy that
[2:45:21.800 --> 2:45:30.120]  um i'm not complaining it's it's just we've all been robbed of our innocence we've been robbed of
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:36.600]  our time we've been robbed of our future and i don't even hate my enemy anymore i realize that
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:41.080]  99 of the people carrying out this new world order are just ignorant they're they're under
[2:45:41.080 --> 2:45:47.240]  mind control there's no other word for it they're under a spell and i'm more horrified for them i
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:51.320]  never understood reading the bible where jesus is saying forgive them father they know not what
[2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:56.280]  they do and other apostles after him actually feeling sorry for those that were persecuting them
[2:45:56.280 --> 2:46:01.080]  but the but they were understanding these people are given over to pure evil they're destroyed
[2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:07.080]  they're losing their soul they're losing their humanity and i don't want to hate the batf for
[2:46:07.080 --> 2:46:16.760]  bombing oklahoma city i don't want to hate all these people especially they're dumb minions that
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:21.480]  don't know what they're part of or some young power tripping cop whose brainwash i just
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:28.280]  i wish they could be good i wish they could know what i know i wish they i could take
[2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:33.560]  them to the places i've been i wish they could see with my eyes what i've seen and i know they've
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:43.240]  seen a lot of things i haven't seen i'm not you know in the past i've hated people that have
[2:46:43.240 --> 2:46:48.600]  attacked me in government and in media and in my own genre as they call it but also
[2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:57.880]  and now i've lost that with greater discernment and i i i i'm more focused i'm more peaceful
[2:46:58.680 --> 2:47:05.320]  but in that quietness i have such greater understanding and in a way i miss the flesh
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:10.280]  and i still have a lot of flesh in me i still have a lot of worldliness in me but it's much
[2:47:10.280 --> 2:47:18.760]  weaker than it was a long time ago and i almost miss hating my enemies and miss that because it
[2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:23.640]  was a distraction it was a worldly distraction kind of a tunnel vision to distract me from the
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:28.680]  larger mission i'm on so that i wouldn't have to just constantly sit here with the information
[2:47:28.680 --> 2:47:33.400]  just seething through me and the i mean i don't even want to most days i don't cover the news i
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:38.200]  do all the research and don't even cover most of it because i don't want to cover this i don't
[2:47:38.200 --> 2:47:43.000]  want to focus and have the thoughts again i had earlier and the understanding and all the info
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:49.800]  i mean i'm like uh i guess i'm kind of like a cop or something that is a detective and has done
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:54.680]  a couple hundred murder investigations and at a certain point i don't want to see dead families
[2:47:54.680 --> 2:47:59.320]  and blood and death and torture chambers and and then that's what i see that's what i do
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:05.080]  and i and i've watched the murderers in fancy five thousand dollar suits traipsing around
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:17.240]  destroying my country destroying our whole future and it just goes on and on and on
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:23.560]  and i can't stop i can't give up even if i was a coward and wanted to give up it's not in me i
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:32.360]  can't do it and if i give up they'll come after me even more i have to continue we all have to
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:36.840]  continue we're not getting out of this folks we're going through it you understand you're not
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:42.040]  backing out of this we passed the point of return into world government a long time ago
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:46.440]  and that's the thing i realize a lot of you don't know what's your end even i'm not talking about
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:50.120]  those of you that have been fighting this you're in it too but at least you know it's like walking
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:56.200]  around the field at night with big 50 foot pits and it was spikes in the bottom and i'm a guy saying
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:00.360]  you better have a flashlight you better be careful out in that field man there's some bad stuff look
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:05.880]  at history i've fallen into those pits i've seen a lot of other people fall into those pits you
[2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:12.040]  better listen to me this isn't a game and i watch people laugh at me and go stumble off the cliff
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:14.120]  and i go did you just see him fall into that pit
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:24.680]  and i don't want the fbi and the military and the police and the bureaucrats and the corporate
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:30.840]  people to go along with this i don't want to see them lost i don't want to see them serve it
[2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:34.760]  they think a lot of them at a primitive level they're tough guys that's how the world really
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:38.680]  works and you're just weak and can't understand it we're doing we're you know we're making the
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:44.360]  tough decisions and you just can't get you know your mind wrapped around that and you know yeah
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:49.080]  we're evil but we're the evil that's protecting you you know we've got to be evil to defeat the
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:55.800]  real evil and you know that that's the system that they the lie the mindset that's sold by them
[2:49:55.800 --> 2:50:01.160]  that these merchants of death and merchants of lies and fraud and deceit push
[2:50:07.480 --> 2:50:13.160]  and i was never an evil person but i i could go there in my mind when i was young
[2:50:13.160 --> 2:50:23.080]  i could see the beauty of evil on the surface it can look sexy and powerful but then i really
[2:50:24.680 --> 2:50:30.360]  stuck my head into it and went whoa and pulled back and it strengthened my humanity by pulling
[2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:37.240]  out of it and there's those of you out there that think you're winning and think you have this power
[2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:41.640]  and think that you're out there just slaughtering and enslaving and abusing and you don't think of

[2:55:01.960 --> 2:55:09.000]  the air thanks for holding welcome hey alec hey buddy hi uh it's nice to speak to you again i want
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:14.040]  to commend you on being one of the few last credible sources of information out there but
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:19.800]  i called to touch on the the point that you said earlier about how the bible was being changed and
[2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:25.080]  how this is really and truly a spiritual battle uh although most of us only see the secular side
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:30.200]  and i wanted to read something to the listeners out there real quick who think that
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:35.080]  jesus was always a pacifist and believed in letting evil trample over him
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:37.880]  him my lord said this
[2:55:40.680 --> 2:55:48.600]  but now he that half the purse let him take it and likewise his script and he that half no
[2:55:48.600 --> 2:55:56.200]  sword let himself his garment and buy one he said that these things were going to be necessary
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:01.400]  for the transgressions that were coming concerning him at the end of time
[2:56:01.400 --> 2:56:08.200]  and we are in a very deep spiritual battle with these people who you talk about every day who are
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:19.400]  the sons of satan and many of us are going to lose our bodies in this battle and our our lives
[2:56:20.200 --> 2:56:25.560]  in this battle that you won't lose your soul and you have to understand that we are spiritual beings
[2:56:25.560 --> 2:56:32.600]  caught in a in a paradox of space and time and for anybody that doesn't know that they have no
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:40.200]  discernment we're on a planet in deep space they've i've got the top cern scientist in mainstream
[2:56:40.200 --> 2:56:49.080]  news saying they're about to open a interdimensional gate the beings who run this this world that
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:55.800]  serve their god satan they have illuminated knowledge that they have not shared with the rest
[2:56:55.800 --> 2:57:00.920]  of humanity and they use that's the big lie they know if the public knew the truth they'd
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:06.920]  instantly repent absolutely they know that's the thing about the truly evil ones they know
[2:57:06.920 --> 2:57:13.960]  all this kill steal and destroy what does eco science say kill us their religion was killing
[2:57:13.960 --> 2:57:22.280]  us 3000 years ago and it is today you're absolutely right and that we are so close to the end times
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:28.520]  the great prophet daniel said that at the end times babelon which is the system we live under
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:34.920]  not the place over there in persia that we now call iraq babelon which is the system would speak
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:41.400]  with the voice of the lion you can look this up yourself now what that means is the lion was a
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:47.160]  symbology for england so in the end times the world is going to speak english the other night
[2:57:47.720 --> 2:57:54.520]  on cbs news they were playing a little story about the beauty contest in south america which of
[2:57:54.520 --> 2:58:03.160]  course i took some interest in uh but these girls spoke and looked just as as english and american
[2:58:03.160 --> 2:58:07.880]  and and you could not even could not even pick up an accent in their voice they're teaching the
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:13.080]  children in the middle of it is in the world it is the it is the global imperial language
[2:58:14.040 --> 2:58:18.040]  absolutely because they're they're preparing us for this new babelon this new
[2:58:18.040 --> 2:58:23.880]  one world system one world order in which they bring the chaos and then they bring the solutions

[3:01:41.560 --> 3:01:47.240]  self-explaned in the photos i also had a couple other points i wanted to get across right i think
[3:01:47.240 --> 3:01:53.320]  are important um here's what the new world order is it's if you understand the system people the new
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:02:00.360]  listeners on the show it's the combination of risk monopoly and chess you combine those three
[3:02:00.360 --> 3:02:06.200]  principles those three games and you understand what the system is the individuals however to
[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:12.600]  understand them yet to understand history patterns and psychology and what is their psychology their
[3:02:12.600 --> 3:02:20.520]  psychology is being sociopaths highly paranoid psychopaths addictive personalities obsessive
[3:02:20.520 --> 3:02:28.440]  compulsive hyper competitive calculated control freaks and in some cases pedophiles i've seen
[3:02:28.440 --> 3:02:34.280]  that and they believe them well yeah they use they use they use criminal guilds and secret
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:40.440]  criminal guilds of compromised people and pedophiles are one of that's always been that way with satanist
[3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:45.800]  and and people throughout history it even before they called it satanism it was all about sacrificing
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:51.960]  children because the state and the priest class demands are most pure and innocent it's a war
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:56.520]  against innocence but but yes the pedophile guilds are very near the top of the pyramid
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:01.720]  that's what they believe they also believe in this idea called if uh if i can't have it no one can
[3:03:01.720 --> 3:03:07.320]  in other words uh they'll destroy the world all of their philosophy i had that in game all these top
[3:03:08.120 --> 3:03:13.480]  transhumanists say if we can't control the world we will destroy it lennon wrote that you're you
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:18.200]  really know what your stuff uh gabe good thing here's their game you want to understand their
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:23.560]  game their game is an aristocratic game where people are mere play things remember the america
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:29.240]  revolutionary war with the battlefields i looked like a big um board game how the troops would be
[3:03:29.240 --> 3:03:34.280]  lined up shooting each other and why did they do that because they wanted to be gentlemanly like
[3:03:34.280 --> 3:03:38.920]  and we have to remember what their ideas come from they come from british royalties remember
[3:03:38.920 --> 3:03:43.800]  david remember david gurghan white house advisor to four administrations got in my face and said
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:49.240]  you sneaking into behemian grove wasn't very gentlemanly my friend loved that clip he said
[3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:54.360]  that was the best thing you ever saw in his life and as far as these people are going you gotta
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:03:58.920]  remember what the elite are like they're basically a british royalty and they believe in they're
[3:03:58.920 --> 3:04:04.040]  basically a bunch of decadence sickening hyper intelligent control freaks and i don't like
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:07.960]  what they're doing to me and my family and other people and i don't like them going after innocent
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:12.520]  people and i'm sick of their garbage that's why they're openly honest about what they're doing
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:16.520]  they want us to know what they're doing so they can justify everything they're doing
[3:04:16.520 --> 3:04:22.840]  and and they say they say exactly we admit what we're doing but then we lie about it
[3:04:22.840 --> 3:04:28.760]  because if you're profane and deserve to be destroyed then we admit it to you but then deny
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:33.800]  it it's a mind game to say well we told you we're going to do this now we're going to launch our

[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:05.640]  with patsy's dupes moles and when you understand the methodology and pattern of why they use drills
[3:09:05.640 --> 3:09:11.080]  why they use moles why they use patsy's this is a lot of this has been declassified you can
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:22.680]  understand it now we're two weeks plus uh into the or almost two weeks into the murders at fort hood
[3:09:22.680 --> 3:09:29.400]  texas major hassan of fort hood a patsy and a drill gone live question mark is a detailed
[3:09:29.400 --> 3:09:36.280]  article we appreciate webster sending it to us for publishing at info wars dot com it is a huge
[3:09:36.280 --> 3:09:47.320]  article uh more than was it 18 19 pages a huge bibliography all mainstream news sources so with
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:52.120]  us in this segment the next and part of the segment after that that i'm doing my breakdown of the
[3:09:52.120 --> 3:09:59.880]  watchman is webster Griffin terribly specifically on this subject webster it's great to have you on
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:04.840]  thanks for coming on on short notice thank you alexis thank you for the kind words well the
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:09.160]  truth is the truth veritas must be trumpeted uh webster i'm going to try to sit back because we
[3:10:09.160 --> 3:10:14.440]  don't have a lot of time with you today go through your article break it down maybe first explain
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:18.280]  them well you you know how to explain it but i would imagine it'd be good if you explained how
[3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:24.600]  patsy's dupes drills are used over and over again we see the same fingerprints completely i mean it
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:33.080]  really overdone here and uh your uh basic uh breakdown on what you believe really happened
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:39.320]  at fordhood and then why they did it webster partly thank you alex uh you've already said the most
[3:10:39.320 --> 3:10:44.360]  important uh premise i guess which is the there's a method to these things and once you know the
[3:10:44.360 --> 3:10:51.240]  method you can recognize them i think relatively easily uh false flag terrorism or these kinds of
[3:10:51.240 --> 3:10:56.920]  provocations that are dished up by intelligence agencies involved the use of first of all the
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:03.560]  patsy that would be somebody like li javi oswald or mohammed atta or or cho the shooter there at
[3:11:03.560 --> 3:11:10.440]  the virginia tech will read them again mcvay and the bong sirhan sirhan james orray these are the
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:15.080]  patsy's these are the the fall guys and they're going to be demonized based on the group they
[3:11:15.080 --> 3:11:19.800]  represent or the political view they represent but generally look at these people they're low-grade
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:23.640]  subjects they often don't know what's going on around them sometimes they're psychotics they're
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:29.240]  fanatics they're dupes they're drugged they're brainwashed you have to look they're always screwed
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:35.800]  up ding dongs yes right and but always always getting noticed but always not always getting
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:41.880]  away with it they were doing egregious crazy things but never never having said and we have that here
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:48.280]  he's he's saying all these horrible things worshiping suicide bombers uh the fbi cia he tried to
[3:11:48.280 --> 3:11:54.760]  contact al qaeda he didn't know he was contacting the cia he's the he's a soldier of allah he he
[3:11:54.760 --> 3:11:59.720]  wants to get people put on trial for war crimes but you have to look deeper the the moral right
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:04.520]  inside the government uh there's a private network it's not a government network i call it a wall
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:10.200]  street network call it a rogue network it's it's an anglo-american intelligence network and this
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:16.280]  has its own separate agenda and they try to make sure that the patsy's don't get rounded up until
[3:12:16.280 --> 3:12:21.400]  the event occurs the mole wants to make sure that the patsy is left free because otherwise
[3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:26.760]  you can't blame him if he's so that's evidence one that as usual like nine eleven like mcvee
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:34.040]  like serhan serhan like lee harvey oswald they always protect the minion until until it happens
[3:12:34.040 --> 3:12:37.800]  and then of course they round them up right away because then then they've got to come up with a
[3:12:37.800 --> 3:12:42.520]  with a scapegoat and then of course we have the technicians the people that you don't see
[3:12:42.520 --> 3:12:47.720]  who actually have the physical technical capability of bringing about the events the people who
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:51.400]  wired the buildings for controlled demolition or who really did the shooting
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:57.320]  they're in deilly pallet plaza in uh in dallas way back when so uh you've got to look at it from
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:13:01.240]  this point of view and the other thing that you've said extremely important the drills always look
[3:13:01.240 --> 3:13:07.240]  for drills anybody talking about a drill a drill going on at the same time a drill that looks sort
[3:13:07.240 --> 3:13:13.560]  of like what happened that can indicate that a drill has gone live been taken live or been flipped
[3:13:13.560 --> 3:13:18.280]  live so that's essentially it and of course the brainwashing role of the controlled wall
[3:13:18.280 --> 3:13:23.960]  street media always an important thing so i start with this basically saying look don't focus
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:30.600]  immediately on major hassan focus on the fact that we have multiple eyewitnesses at ford hood
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:37.080]  who give interviews to abc and cbs and the miami herald and the austin tv and they all say
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:42.520]  we thought we were in a drill a drill a drill a drill now that's just a subjective impression
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:46.840]  but it means that these are experienced combat soldiers many of them and they've been through
[3:13:46.840 --> 3:13:52.120]  this before that the military is always doing drills right they do the red team and the blue
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:57.080]  team they they drill everything that they they would normally do in combat operations or
[3:13:57.640 --> 3:14:04.040]  or whatever it is and in this case uh you want to know why hassan might have gone to this event
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:09.400]  with a gun he may have known what he was doing he may have gone with criminal intent but then again
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:15.240]  he may have been just a psychotic patsy dupe who walked into what he thought was a drill uh you
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:21.560]  can you can look at the 911 hijackers most of them thought they were going to be actors in a drill
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:26.440]  and they were in a drill until the drill went live and i think that's been confirmed confirmed
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:32.360]  they were trained at us bases on that's that's admitted folks uh go ahead and then of course
[3:14:32.360 --> 3:14:39.480]  we've got this 25 plus drills drills operations that were completed just before 9 11 ongoing
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:45.640]  the morning is them of the 9 11 is the majority of them or in the advanced stages of of planning so
[3:14:45.640 --> 3:14:50.280]  the other thing then is to look for these strange anomalies and contradictions for example
[3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:56.040]  the news reports during the entire afternoon of this fordhood tragedy which is of course a tragic
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:02.520]  event uh we were told there were three shooters that there was one killed and there were two others
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:07.560]  in custody and this is the kind of stuff that comes out at the beginning right you've always
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:12.440]  got to go and get screenshots of what happens very early on because after after a while this
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:17.480]  stuff gets expunged and people forget about it because the media is focusing on hassan but
[3:15:17.480 --> 3:15:22.680]  we were told that there were two other shooters where are they we were told that there were two
[3:15:22.680 --> 3:15:28.120]  shooting incidents one at this readiness center but another one at this place called the house
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:34.280]  theater which is a theater on the uh on the army post but now the other two shooters have disappeared
[3:15:34.280 --> 3:15:40.760]  from the narrative as of about 10 o'clock that evening and we're told that he was killed for six
[3:15:40.760 --> 3:15:46.120]  hours right that's the the other thing about patsy of course is they always do things that are
[3:15:46.120 --> 3:15:50.680]  physically impossible and i guess the ultimate of physical impossibilities to come back from
[3:15:50.680 --> 3:15:57.240]  the dead but we find now that lieutenant general cone the base commander had pronounced hassan dead
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:16:02.200]  but then brought him back to life in that same press conference at about 10 9 or 10 o'clock
[3:16:02.200 --> 3:16:08.680]  in the evening of the day of the shooting so all of this makes us extremely suspicious and then
[3:16:08.680 --> 3:16:15.800]  of course we can look at hassan and look at his profile does he fulfill this feature of the patsy
[3:16:15.800 --> 3:16:21.560]  that he's got to get noticed he's got to be egregious um for example we have this powerpoint
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:29.080]  presentation by hassan and this takes us way back into 2000 and um and eight i think in this
[3:16:29.080 --> 3:16:34.680]  by the way people are being court-martialed for criticizing bush or obama just slightly but
[3:16:34.680 --> 3:16:39.160]  he's running around doing things that no one would be allowed to do but he gives us he gives
[3:16:39.160 --> 3:16:46.600]  us slideshow where he says we love death more than you love life all right this is id format al-qaeda
[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:51.640]  speak this is this is what u.s. intelligence thinks comes out of the mouth of al-qaeda and of
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:58.840]  course remember al-qaeda is this cia arab legion a group of patsy's a group of terrorists and so
[3:16:58.840 --> 3:17:04.920]  forth but but run by the anglo-american intelligence that we see hassan getting away with all kinds
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:12.040]  of crazy um outrageous things he he uh apparently not the latest news is that he has business cards
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:18.120]  saying that he's a soldier of a la he wants to get other soldiers court-martialed based on what
[3:17:18.120 --> 3:17:23.080]  they've told him in his psychiatric interviews he wants and the way they would set this guy up one
[3:17:23.080 --> 3:17:29.800]  of many was tell him oh you're undercover looking for extremist oh you're uh again we've seen this
[3:17:29.800 --> 3:17:35.400]  in the past yes he maybe thought he was a double agent but of course he's he's got to be a double
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:41.240]  agent who's who's not that smart and indeed among his supervisors and this is all right down the
[3:17:41.240 --> 3:17:47.720]  rodeo between the Bethesda complex where you have the national institutes of health and the national
[3:17:47.720 --> 3:17:54.360]  uniform services uh and notice he comes out of the same blacksburg university that the other
[3:17:54.360 --> 3:17:59.800]  shooter was produced out of right the show he's got the show pedigree that the thing about
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:06.600]  how fun it's interesting is up to now islamic fundamentalist terrorists so-called come in
[3:18:06.600 --> 3:18:13.640]  groups they have a communitarian social uh aspect to them but now this is the first time that i know
[3:18:13.640 --> 3:18:20.120]  of uh since sir han sir han at that in which time this was a little lone wolf the lone wolf but the
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:27.320]  islamic fundamentalist lone wolf the troubled loner who's got the coran in his hand allegedly
[3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:34.120]  and his his fighting jihad so that's that's a first so that brings together the atah kind of guy
[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:40.040]  with the uh the show in other words show is somebody who comes out of psychiatric clinics
[3:18:40.040 --> 3:18:45.000]  and so does hassan but hassan but we see that with sir han and mcvay they always have this
[3:18:45.000 --> 3:18:51.960]  psychiatric background yes but again now now islamic so the the question is the supervisors
[3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:56.520]  at walter reid army hospital which is a walter reid of course is not quite part of that but
[3:18:56.520 --> 3:19:02.360]  that's the thing but it's just a few miles away they have a meeting where they ask is major hassan
[3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:08.920]  a psychotic and of course the answer to that is yes the big question then is here is somebody who
[3:19:08.920 --> 3:19:16.360]  uh almost automatically has to have at least a secret level security clearance uh any army officer
[3:19:16.360 --> 3:19:22.040]  according to what i've been able to find has to have at least a security clearance of secret he may
[3:19:22.040 --> 3:19:28.120]  have had more he may have had top secret he may have had you know key and code uh cosmic nato
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:34.040]  level whatever but at least secret so the thing is when you do these egregious things and say we
[3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:38.200]  love life more than you love death that's when somebody's going to come and investigate you if
[3:19:38.200 --> 3:19:43.400]  only for the security hey if you have bad credit you can't get a low level security clearance
[3:19:43.960 --> 3:19:49.080]  he's running around saying i love al-qaeda and they're just like protecting protecting protecting
[3:19:49.080 --> 3:19:54.280]  protecting and then you've got the drill being reported the webster stay there we're going to

[3:24:10.840 --> 3:24:17.160]  Webster Tarpley our guest okay Webster continue from the point we left off it
[3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:23.800]  a couple of things that are interesting is that uh major hassan is exchanging emails with this
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:31.000]  character awlaki and awlaki is obviously a kind of pied piper for patsies he was in a patsy
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:38.040]  minder for honey hanjur that's the pentagon pilot supposedly if you believe that he could do those
[3:24:38.040 --> 3:24:43.000]  feats of flying which is completely impossible all the top pilots have said it's a complete fraud
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:50.520]  go ahead awlaki is also a part of entrapping the fort dick six as well as this group of dupes in
[3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:56.600]  toronto who took delivery of all that fertilizer right from the royal canadian mounted please so
[3:24:56.600 --> 3:25:02.680]  awlaki is obviously a provocateur now when it goes on and on and on and on and al-qaeda was
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:08.360]  admittedly set up by the cia brazinski i mean just it's incredible we also have that the there is
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:14.120]  this uh the joint terrorism task force where the information about hassan exchanging emails with
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:20.760]  awlaki the uh the the patsy pied piper this was made available but between the fbi and the defense
[3:25:20.760 --> 3:25:25.960]  criminal investigation service they decided that this was not relevant and that the commanding
[3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:32.120]  officer of the of the base there at fort hood should not be be told um so you have all of this
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:39.320]  uh the other thing is just like mohammed atah hassan cannot be a muslim hassan is someone
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:47.080]  who goes to strip clubs he frequents the stars strip club there in keleen texas he buys lap
[3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:53.800]  dancers he comes in with a six pack of beer and drinks some of it and gives the rest to the strippers
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:26:01.240]  like atah he prefers blond remember atah was cohabiting with this uh this one by the way
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:05.400]  that means it's really a raunchy club because in texas the ones where you bring your own liquor
[3:26:05.400 --> 3:26:11.240]  round of the totally nude okay well that's where he goes so he's been there at least two or three
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:17.000]  times during the month of of october so this is a complete uh it's a complete farce now
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:22.760]  in terms of what happened um i can't tell you exactly what happened there are at least two
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:30.120]  scenarios one is that hassan is simply a psychotic dupe who is told that he's going to take part in
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:36.040]  a drill because it based on this and the testimony from these soldiers these drills are done on an
[3:26:36.040 --> 3:26:40.920]  ad hoc basis they're frequent and they can come up at any time and they're on record believing
[3:26:40.920 --> 3:26:45.880]  it was a drill they all thought that they said you know it was what we've been through before
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:51.000]  they do into the they do this all the time we have drills they thought they were rubber bullets
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:56.200]  so hassan might have thought hey i'm gonna go and and be an actor in a drill today i'm gonna play
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:00.840]  the islamic fundamentalist who opens fire so of course he's going to get up on a chair and yell
[3:27:00.840 --> 3:27:06.360]  allahu akbar because that's the script but then the technicians show up and the technicians would
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:11.960]  be other shooters who actually are capable of efficient shooting right more than a hundred
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:17.640]  shots that's too much for one person i think even if he's surrounded by unarmed soldiers those
[3:27:17.640 --> 3:27:22.760]  are still combat veterans they can tackle him or come after him or whatever it is the other
[3:27:22.760 --> 3:27:28.920]  possibility is that hassan has been put through clockwork orange brainwashing and that takes us
[3:27:28.920 --> 3:27:34.600]  back to virginia tech uh at blacksburg virginia there's something going on at black by the way
[3:27:34.600 --> 3:27:40.360]  that exists that's been declassified that stuff is real right and we know that we've seen show kill
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:47.080]  32 people plus himself we also had at the same virginia tech campus a chinese graduate student
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:51.800]  had her head cut off she would oh and i gotta stop you this was confirmed we first reported
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:58.200]  here from students that live there they kept having marine corps drills with the marine corps rotc
[3:27:58.200 --> 3:28:03.960]  of shooting drills and takeovers and people thought that that was happening again very very
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:09.000]  very interesting and then of course there was also recently two murders at virginia tech in
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:16.040]  august of virginia tech is one strange place so that would be the possibility that that that
[3:28:16.040 --> 3:28:21.160]  major hassan had been put through some kind of heavy duty clockwork orange brainwashing so that
[3:28:21.160 --> 3:28:26.840]  he was a manchurian candidate and if you tell him the code word he starts shooting that's possible
[3:28:26.840 --> 3:28:32.600]  but even there he could be like sir han sir han all indications are sir han sir han really had a
[3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:37.960]  gun and really shot but that wouldn't have been enough in other words and by the way the la police
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:44.040]  department for those that don't know the coroner they all said it was not the caliber that rfk
[3:28:44.040 --> 3:28:50.440]  was shot with he was shot in the back turns out that guy was cia other cia people were photographed
[3:28:50.440 --> 3:28:56.440]  there this is even mainstream news now that sir han was a patsy so the idea is that that even if
[3:28:56.440 --> 3:29:03.240]  it's our son is it is a brainwashed patsy who goes there and shoots to make sure that they get the
[3:29:03.240 --> 3:29:08.440]  effect they've got other shooters who are much more capable trained marksmen professional killers
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:15.400]  or he could just be a radical muslim extremists that they guided and allowed to attack it's possible
[3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:22.040]  though i think that's that's probably the least likely but we know we know we know they knew according
[3:29:22.040 --> 3:29:30.040]  to their own story and let him do it correct so there's the question is who in the defense
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:37.640]  intelligence agency who in the fbi and who in this nih walter read uniform services who are the
[3:29:37.640 --> 3:29:43.880]  people who blocked any investigation or actions because those might be the mold and then the
[3:29:43.880 --> 3:29:50.040]  final question why'd they stage it straight ahead info wars dot com has his article major asan at
[3:29:50.040 --> 3:29:57.320]  a port hood a patsy and a drill gone we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn

[3:33:20.200 --> 3:33:27.160]  same bus were bomb at the exact same time exact same locations i played the clip earlier advisor
[3:33:27.160 --> 3:33:31.800]  consultancy had admitting the government hired him to do it that way there's a smoke screen that way of
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:36.840]  the patsies uh get caught by the wrong group they just say it's part of a drill that way of the
[3:33:36.840 --> 3:33:41.880]  operatives the technicians get caught they just say they were part of the drill they use the drills
[3:33:41.880 --> 3:33:47.640]  to smoke screen the nsa and other compartments that may pick up the chatter all right we got
[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:53.000]  about four or five minutes left here webster the motive obviously morale is low in the military
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:59.160]  obama's launching a major escalation of 40 000 troops to the already 300 000 troop force of
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:06.200]  international us and afghan troops 12 to 1 against the taliban i e anybody that doesn't
[3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:13.240]  pay their opium cut to the central banks this is a way to relaunch the war relaunch the idea that
[3:34:13.240 --> 3:34:19.560]  we're under attack like the staged attack on the pentagon on 9 11 this is a way to reignite the fear
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:24.760]  we've seen other patsies lately where the fbi recruits them cooks the bomb trains them tries to
[3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:30.600]  get them to bomb buildings in illinois and other states same replay building up to another false
[3:34:30.600 --> 3:34:37.720]  flag creating the illusion that we need to keep these wars going uh webster tarpoli what's the
[3:34:37.720 --> 3:34:43.080]  modus operandi for this false flag i think for now that the the goals are two things the first is
[3:34:43.080 --> 3:34:48.200]  that obama is stalling obama really is dithering and there really is a faction fight i think in the
[3:34:48.200 --> 3:34:53.720]  administration you've got a faction in the state department around this guy i can bury and matthew
[3:34:53.720 --> 3:34:59.240]  ho who are saying don't escalate don't escalate matthew ho was saying get out that represents a
[3:34:59.240 --> 3:35:04.280]  body of opinion in the in the state department you've even got biden who says don't send more
[3:35:04.280 --> 3:35:10.840]  troops just send more predator drones so i think the rogue network meaning this wall street conglomerate
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:18.200]  is saying you know let's push obama into complete escalation we want obama as a war monger remember
[3:35:18.200 --> 3:35:24.200]  the goal of that is to break up pakistan if you break up pakistan you're threatening china and
[3:35:24.200 --> 3:35:29.720]  you're also threatening iran so it's a geopolitics and notice this is all being launched right as
[3:35:29.720 --> 3:35:35.080]  the new show trial for the 9 11 patsies where they admit they've been torturing and threatening
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:41.800]  to torture their children to get them to confess to building bombings where buildings didn't exist
[3:35:41.800 --> 3:35:47.560]  when they were arrested just totally made up the other thing of course is that obama is worried
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:53.720]  about his own political future and that that does play a role although not a not not be major role
[3:35:53.720 --> 3:35:59.880]  but is this a test to test the waters for a bigger false flag it could be but let me get to this point
[3:35:59.880 --> 3:36:04.440]  at the obama's basically saying if i do this i'm going to lose my whole left wing and in fact
[3:36:04.440 --> 3:36:09.080]  there's going to be an emergency anti-war demonstration here in washington on december 12th
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:13.880]  and lafayette park at the white house so obama is going to hear protest through his own windows
[3:36:13.880 --> 3:36:20.200]  which has been a rare event up to now uh the other thing is that you have the anti-obama
[3:36:20.200 --> 3:36:27.320]  opposition growing the uh the rogue network would like to endow that opposition with islamophobia
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:32.520]  hatred of arabs hatred of moslems and so forth you look at what limbaugh hannity o'reilly glenn
[3:36:32.520 --> 3:36:38.200]  beckon so forth are doing this is now straight you know delirium of hatred against against uh
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:44.920]  against islam now a third level maybe the higher level is that we also have this dollar crisis
[3:36:44.920 --> 3:36:49.720]  going on and there may be a group in the ruling elite that can control this rogue network
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:55.960]  saying look uh we've got to do something to save the dollar forget geopolitics let's look at the
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:37:02.200]  dollar let's have a big shooting incident in the persian gulf let's have the straits of home
[3:37:02.200 --> 3:37:08.840]  was closed let's have a catastrophe in term of world oil supplies that's going to be bad for china
[3:37:08.840 --> 3:37:13.800]  that's going to be bad for japan and you'll have the flight to safety the flight of all the hot
[3:37:13.800 --> 3:37:18.760]  money in the world into the dollar which is the likely result of a crisis of that magnitude
[3:37:18.760 --> 3:37:25.640]  still today uh they think at least and by the way uh roiders today imf had eyes global currency
[3:37:25.640 --> 3:37:31.320]  change presses on yawn the imperative of greater global currency stability means the world can no
[3:37:31.320 --> 3:37:36.840]  longer relies it's done since the end of the gold standard on currency issued by a single country the
[3:37:36.840 --> 3:37:42.920]  head of the imf shed on tuesday uh that's dominique straws con the bill berg group member and there's
[3:37:42.920 --> 3:37:47.400]  all this propaganda about how this has got to happen web serve this is too important let me
[3:37:47.400 --> 3:37:54.680]  have the guys talk to you off air for a part two on the dollar and your uh breakdown on the different
[3:37:54.680 --> 3:38:00.200]  options the controllers have and what cards you think they're going to play in the near future
[3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:04.840]  but i really want to thank you for the amazing piece that you wrote and sent to us to post at
[3:38:04.840 --> 3:38:10.680]  info wars dot com major hassan on ford hood a patsy and a drill gone live you've only seen the tip

[3:38:26.040 --> 3:38:31.560]  on the dollar a separate subject thank you so much for your penetrating analysis all right
[3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:37.240]  there goes webster griffin tarply shifting gears i have a giant stack of news i haven't
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:43.160]  even blitzed yet speaking of the taliban being a staged operation the times of london and others
[3:38:43.160 --> 3:38:51.160]  msnbc reported on the airlift of evil in january and february of 2002 how six thousand taliban
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:58.200]  and al-qaeda commanders were flown out to safety in to pakistan by the cia generals and people
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:04.280]  would capture them will be ordered to release them and how they would be paid in gold here it is again
[3:39:04.840 --> 3:39:10.920]  yesterday times of london army tells its soldiers to bribe the taliban give me a close shot for
[3:39:10.920 --> 3:39:19.320]  prison planet dot tv viewers army tells its soldiers to bribe the taliban with gold and it says give
[3:39:19.320 --> 3:39:29.960]  them bags of gold like the us does give them bags of gold again ladies and gentlemen i mean it's just
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:35.320]  it's totally staged the higher levels are just globalist mercenaries and they've got little muslim
[3:39:35.320 --> 3:39:46.920]  extremists that work for them this is the facts this is the history shifting gears now i want to
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:52.600]  play a few minutes from the movie the watchman when it was in theaters a few months ago a big
[3:39:52.600 --> 3:40:02.200]  smash hit i knew that the writer of the original comic strip is an admitted aluminist and into
[3:40:02.200 --> 3:40:10.040]  high level 33rd degree masonry and so i went to see the film and the only thing we've edited
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:15.240]  out of this is some of the cussing and under fair use i'm going to play this so we can break down
[3:40:15.240 --> 3:40:21.000]  a few minutes of the film and analyze what's going on but i'm going to talk more about this later
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:27.080]  in the week because we're running out of time and there's so much evidence on this front but
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:32.520]  what we're dealing with here is revelation of the method the elite believes in their own writings
[3:40:32.520 --> 3:40:38.360]  that they must tell you what they're going to do to you beforehand and that they must explain to you
[3:40:38.360 --> 3:40:43.560]  through fiction why they're doing what they're doing it's just like in a sword fight with gentlemen
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:50.920]  when they say on guard or unguard on guard i'm about to attack you on guard i'm coming at you on guard
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:57.000]  gene haglin got a phone call he was going to be in town one of the stars of the x files
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:41:04.520]  lone gunman fox tv he calls me and he says i want to come to town the cia came and gave us
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:13.320]  different plots for both of the tv shows and the cia basically told chris carter to produce a show
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:19.320]  where a hijacked jet is flown to the world trade center by a secret group inside the military
[3:41:19.320 --> 3:41:26.440]  industrial complex a rogue group a mole group they they they remote control the jet they use drills
[3:41:26.440 --> 3:41:32.600]  of hijackings and a terror drill to make norad stand down to fly the plane to the world trade
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:42.120]  center to blame it on islamist as terrorists so they can invade afghanistan now this aired
[3:41:42.120 --> 3:41:48.680]  six months before 9 11 we played it many times just google lone gunman episode 9 11 it's all over
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:55.400]  youtube it's all over everywhere or you can go to best buyer wherever and buy the one year series
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:42:01.080]  of the lone gunman the episode what 10 episodes and you can watch it in high quality we actually
[3:42:01.080 --> 3:42:09.080]  bought a copy of it there's hundreds of these examples hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:15.240]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds where they tell you what they're going to do they had oil
[3:42:15.240 --> 3:42:21.320]  storm again six months before katrina the mayor was even part of the production where it hits
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:27.320]  it floods it martial law happens we know they have weather control systems i've interviewed the the
[3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:33.240]  creator of it uh ben livingston meteorologist they're now admitting all this weather controls
[3:42:33.240 --> 3:42:40.840]  being admitted by the white house science are john p holdren but look it goes on and on the issue
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:47.320]  here is psychopaths love to brag they love to taunt the police they love to toy with people this is
[3:42:47.320 --> 3:42:53.320]  their modus operandi now when you go watch this two hour film and don't show it to children it's
[3:42:53.320 --> 3:42:59.320]  very violent especially the director's cut the widescreen edition but you should watch it because
[3:42:59.320 --> 3:43:04.360]  when i walked out of the theater almost everyone was saying i don't get it i don't understand it
[3:43:04.360 --> 3:43:11.720]  i saw review after review after review that said no one understands this this would be like
[3:43:13.240 --> 3:43:18.360]  showing someone two plus two equals four and i don't understand it they explain in the movie
[3:43:19.720 --> 3:43:24.920]  that this mandamus character who's like the luciferian enlightened one
[3:43:24.920 --> 3:43:33.720]  that he stages terror attacks and blows up all these world cities killing millions and millions
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:41.240]  of people so that the world will come together for a world government and he admits they stage
[3:43:41.240 --> 3:43:46.920]  world war one world war two they the cold war it's all staged to bring in this one world government
[3:43:46.920 --> 3:43:52.520]  so there'll be total peace now the only true superhero in it dr manhattan who can create
[3:43:52.520 --> 3:43:58.920]  planets do whatever he wants be anywhere in the universe he is trying to stop whoever's blowing
[3:43:58.920 --> 3:44:08.520]  up us cities until he finally catches his former partner and that's the scene we're going to play
[3:44:08.520 --> 3:44:13.800]  where he catches him and he explains i had to do it to create unity and then dr manhattan says oh
[3:44:13.800 --> 3:44:18.760]  you're right i understand and the moral person rorschach who goes out and kills child molesters
[3:44:18.760 --> 3:44:24.440]  and people he's the bad guy at the end and they go yes you're trying to stop child molesters that's
[3:44:24.440 --> 3:44:30.200]  earlier in the movie you are the bad one you don't like raping children and dogs eating their rotten
[3:44:30.200 --> 3:44:42.200]  bodies you are bad and dr manhattan kills him this is a day we shall never forget and yet we go
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:54.600]  forward to defend the human race and all that is good and just in our world thank you god bless
[3:44:54.600 --> 3:45:07.720]  us all do you see two superpowers retreating from war i've saved the earth from hell we both have
[3:45:07.720 --> 3:45:20.360]  this is as much your victory as it is mine now we can return do what we were meant to
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:29.240]  we were meant to exact justice everyone's gonna know what you've done well then by exposing me
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:35.080]  you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today peace based on a lie but peace
[3:45:35.080 --> 3:45:43.080]  peace nonetheless he's right exposing adrian would only do the world to nuclear destruction
[3:45:43.080 --> 3:45:54.040]  again no we can't do this on mars you taught me the value of life if we hope to preserve it here
[3:45:55.720 --> 3:45:56.920]  we must remain silent
[3:45:56.920 --> 3:46:03.000]  keep your own secrets
[3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:11.560]  don't even think about it
[3:46:14.520 --> 3:46:15.080]  rorschach
[3:46:17.880 --> 3:46:24.520]  wait never compromise not even in the face of armageddon
[3:46:24.520 --> 3:46:28.120]  it's always been the difference between us
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:42.520]  i've made myself feel every day
[3:46:42.520 --> 3:46:53.320]  i see every innocent face i've murdered to save humanity
[3:46:56.680 --> 3:47:02.840]  you understand don't you without condemning or condemning
[3:47:02.840 --> 3:47:09.240]  i understand
[3:47:14.920 --> 3:47:24.680]  dad a world united in a peace there had to be sacrificed you have an idealized mankind but
[3:47:24.680 --> 3:47:33.800]  you you've deformed it you mutilated it that's your legacy out of my way people have to be told
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:39.960]  you know i can't let you do that suddenly you discover humanity
[3:47:42.600 --> 3:47:47.080]  convenient
[3:47:47.080 --> 3:47:53.240]  i'm scared from the start none of this would have happened
[3:47:59.640 --> 3:48:00.840]  what are you waiting for
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:05.240]  christ
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:13.400]  you
[3:48:27.320 --> 3:48:32.280]  and now he's dead there's the beautiful rorschach pattern of his blood and guts the beauty
[3:48:32.280 --> 3:48:38.440]  the artwork of dr manhattan and dr manhattan is being blamed for all these cities worldwide and tens
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:45.880]  of millions dead blamed by his former partner that actually staged the terror attacks to bring
[3:48:45.880 --> 3:48:52.600]  the world together with the outside threat and that's why the pentagon stage 9 11 they think
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:57.640]  it's beautiful and good they killed 3 000 people so they can have their world government to bring
[3:48:57.640 --> 3:49:02.360]  you peace that's why they gave nukes to north korea that's why they gave nukes to pakistan that's
[3:49:02.360 --> 3:49:08.200]  why they create saddam and bin laden so they can be the good guy that saves you from all of it
[3:49:09.160 --> 3:49:15.000]  but that's only one level but this is still very high level illuminati new world order
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:20.600]  programming the dark side reaching out to you at a subconscious level the general public having no
[3:49:20.600 --> 3:49:26.760]  idea the high level ritual they've just been part of not understanding it wandering out of the
[3:49:26.760 --> 3:49:33.080]  movie theater saying i didn't get that they staged the terror attacks to bring in world government
[3:49:34.520 --> 3:49:41.640]  just as kissinger says in real documents they have the stage events stage crises this is the
[3:49:41.640 --> 3:49:50.600]  reality of the new world order this is what they're doing this is what they're setting up
[3:49:50.600 --> 3:49:55.400]  this is why they kill us this is why they do everything and rorschach is the bad guy
[3:49:55.400 --> 3:50:02.360]  he doesn't like them murdering children he doesn't like child molesters he's the bad guy the message
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:08.200]  is he's the bad guy because he has morals and if you watch the whole movie he is the bad guy
[3:50:08.840 --> 3:50:14.520]  he is the evil person and that's how the globalist are when you talk to dr pionka the local guy that
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:21.240]  says 90 percent of the public have to be killed by airborne Ebola he says oh i'm very sad that my
[3:50:21.240 --> 3:50:26.600]  family and i have to die you know it's the same thing of oh i'm very sad that we all have to die

[3:50:31.080 --> 3:50:37.640]  a fraud this is their pure evil this is their corruption this is what they're doing this is
