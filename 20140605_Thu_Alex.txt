[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.200 --> 00:30.440]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday June 5th edition 2014 I'm
[00:30.440 --> 00:34.560]  David Knight I'll be your host today we've got a lot of information and we're
[00:34.560 --> 00:37.400]  going to be taking your calls as well today we're going to be talking about
[00:37.400 --> 00:43.720]  Obama many people on both the left and right are talking about how he is
[00:43.720 --> 00:49.040]  becoming more and more like Nixon I would say he's getting his Nixon on both
[00:49.040 --> 00:52.960]  commentators from the left and the right how he's essentially doing what
[00:52.960 --> 00:56.000]  Nixon always wanted to do remember that quote from Nixon in the David Frost
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.880]  interview where he says if the president does it it's not illegal you know that
[00:59.880 --> 01:02.640]  that type of thing that's what we're hearing from the Obama administration
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.560]  now I think that's what we really need to focus on on this Bergdahl case we've
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.440]  seen these types of actions time and time again but as Jonathan Turley has
[01:12.440 --> 01:17.120]  pointed out and he's a I believe it's Harvard it's one of the liberal
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.480]  institutions is the Harvard guys anyway Jonathan Turley has been pointing out on
[01:21.480 --> 01:26.360]  CNN on Sean Hannity very clearly the law states that he has to give 30-day
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.800]  notice in advance not three days afterwards that does he talk to the
[01:31.800 --> 01:37.280]  Congress not three days before 30 days before not 30 minutes after 30 days
[01:37.280 --> 01:44.440]  before it's a very clear violation of the law as we have seen time and again as
[01:44.440 --> 01:49.800]  we have seen with the actions of the NDAA as we which ironically is the clause
[01:49.800 --> 01:53.960]  that has that 30-day provision in it so essentially Obama has been kind of
[01:53.960 --> 01:57.600]  hoisted by his own petard maybe he shouldn't have signed that NDAA act I
[01:57.600 --> 02:00.760]  certainly don't think he should have we're also going to be talking about
[02:00.760 --> 02:06.680]  David Letterman he had Anderson Cooper on his show and desperate as he was to
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.520]  get attention and ratings as he's sinking into irrelevancy they decided they
[02:10.520 --> 02:15.680]  would talk about gun control and basically rehash all of the old liberal
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.920]  talking points so we're going to talk about that in light of the killing in
[02:19.920 --> 02:25.840]  California and you know what's really behind it is really guess what drugs
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.360]  where else do you think people are going to stop acting like animals like that
[02:31.360 --> 02:35.600]  what how do they lose their empathy and sympathy for other humans to be able to
[02:35.600 --> 02:40.480]  kill in that manner it doesn't matter whether it's a gun or whether it's not
[02:40.480 --> 02:45.360]  lives that he used on people the issue is how does one transform from being a
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.320]  human being to someone who will just lash out like that in time and time again
[02:49.320 --> 02:56.080]  we see it is the drugs the SSRI drugs this case it's a Xanax addiction to
[02:56.080 --> 03:00.520]  prescription drugs that is what is making people crazy but we don't want to
[03:00.520 --> 03:05.680]  talk about that we can have a massive war on drugs on recreational drugs but
[03:05.680 --> 03:09.840]  we don't even want to mention the dangerous side effects of the pharmaceutical
[03:09.840 --> 03:14.720]  companies because you know hey those are the sponsors of television virtually
[03:14.720 --> 03:19.680]  all of television sponsored now in a way that it is never before been sponsored
[03:19.680 --> 03:24.400]  by pharmaceutical companies 10 20 years ago you never had every other
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.560]  commercial be a pharmaceutical commercial with a long long list of side
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.640]  effects well this is one side effect we need to be talking about so we're going
[03:32.640 --> 03:35.720]  to talk about that we see that the European central banks are now floating
[03:35.720 --> 03:40.120]  the idea of a negative interest rate that's right let's borrow our way into
[03:40.120 --> 03:43.480]  prosperity and actually we have an article up on infowars where we've got
[03:43.480 --> 03:49.400]  somebody actually suggesting that that's been the motive behind much of the
[03:49.400 --> 03:52.480]  the motivation behind much of the things happening in our economy telling
[03:52.480 --> 03:57.200]  people they can live the good life you can go from playing hard to from working
[03:57.200 --> 04:00.120]  hard to playing hard if you just go into debt that's essentially what this guy
[04:00.120 --> 04:03.920]  says we're going to talk a little bit about that but all this week we've been
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.920]  talking about the freedom of the press we've been talking about how easy it is
[04:08.920 --> 04:13.840]  for government to work with media and to run down the memory hole things like
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.280]  the Bilderberg group meeting secretly for decades to run down the memory hole
[04:19.280 --> 04:23.920]  things like Tiananmen Square 25 years ago to essentially pretend that it
[04:23.920 --> 04:28.600]  didn't exist and make an entire generation of Chinese ignorant about
[04:28.600 --> 04:31.880]  what happened on that day we've seen that they've been able to run down the
[04:31.880 --> 04:38.640]  memory hole NSA whistleblowers like Benny and Drake but a year ago we had
[04:38.640 --> 04:43.160]  the leaks from Snowden and we're gonna talk about the effect that that's had
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.040]  what people have learned about that and how finally that has taken out of the
[04:47.040 --> 04:52.880]  memory hole the dirty hidden secrets of the NSA so join us and we're gonna be
[04:52.880 --> 05:01.880]  taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 this is scottishjohnforinfowars.com I know

[08:28.760 --> 08:32.280]  the Thursday June 5th edition of the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be
[08:32.280 --> 08:38.280]  your host today June 5th it was just one year ago that we saw the first of the
[08:38.280 --> 08:42.240]  Ed Snowden leaks come out you know prior to that even though we had been
[08:42.240 --> 08:46.680]  talking about it for a very long time even though we had had very high ranking
[08:46.680 --> 08:51.240]  NSA whistleblowers people like William Benny and Drake who had come out and
[08:51.240 --> 08:57.680]  warned us what was happening in the wake of 2001 readjustment of the entire NSA
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.520]  structure to essentially take spying that they had been doing abroad and
[09:02.520 --> 09:07.480]  essentially turn that agency inward on the American people in a dragnet
[09:07.480 --> 09:11.880]  surveillance they warned us about it but essentially it went down the memory hole
[09:11.880 --> 09:15.960]  just like the press's coverage of Bilderberg for generations just like the
[09:15.960 --> 09:21.360]  coverage of Tiananmen Square was ignored and the Chinese media the Chinese
[09:21.360 --> 09:25.200]  government the Chinese textbooks pretended that that never happened
[09:25.200 --> 09:30.520]  well we had a press that was essentially pretending that the NSA whistleblowers
[09:30.520 --> 09:33.440]  and what they were talking about essentially wasn't happening even though
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.240]  William Benny was the highest ranking technical person with global
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.000]  responsibility he blew the whistle on what was happening with this it was a
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.680]  tale of insider corruption paying a lot more for software that had been
[09:48.680 --> 09:51.920]  developed they had software that he had developed that he had been a part of that
[09:51.920 --> 09:57.640]  was developed internally in the NSA and it was able to do the job without
[09:57.640 --> 10:01.200]  violating the Fourth Amendment rights of innocent Americans and yet they
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.640]  decided that they would go with a contractor and what that was but they
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.200]  would go with a contractor who would essentially charge a great deal of money
[10:11.200 --> 10:15.680]  and do a dragnet surveillance so they went from one that was called I think
[10:15.680 --> 10:19.000]  Thin Thread was developed internally by Benny and others they went to Trailblazer
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.680]  and they were blowing the whistle but nobody was listening to them
[10:22.680 --> 10:28.000]  fortunately when the Snowden documents came out it's almost now become a passe
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.080]  mime within the last year it's hard to believe that it's only been a year there's
[10:32.080 --> 10:35.040]  been so much information that has leaked out about these leaks so we're going to
[10:35.040 --> 10:38.920]  be talking about that and talking about the fact that there is more than one
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.960]  way to destroy our personal freedoms our freedom of speech and what's going on
[10:43.960 --> 10:48.120]  with the internet and the internet is under attack from a variety of different
[10:48.120 --> 10:53.880]  angles we're going to be talking about net neutrality a great comment the flooding
[10:53.880 --> 10:59.000]  there were comments that flooded the FCC from a video from John Oliver and
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  that's what we need to see we need to see people from both the left and the
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.240]  right who have serious disagreements on many things but we have to come
[11:07.240 --> 11:12.720]  together to agree that we're not going to live under a police state yet we see
[11:12.720 --> 11:17.280]  with people like David Letterman and Anderson Cooper from CNN as I got
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.960]  together on the David Letterman show they started pushing this left right
[11:21.960 --> 11:28.040]  paradigm trying to use the Elliott Rogers murders as an excuse for gun
[11:28.040 --> 11:34.720]  confiscation from innocent law abiding responsible gun owners and here's what
[11:34.720 --> 11:40.120]  they had to say a little bit of it not eliminate guns how to improve this it
[11:40.120 --> 11:44.680]  but now we've just become in nerd to this people are shot and killed each and
[11:44.680 --> 11:50.240]  every day by private handgun ownership this you can't tell me this is an
[11:50.240 --> 11:53.960]  insoluble problem well it certainly I mean at this point it seems the problem
[11:53.960 --> 11:58.240]  that America isn't ready to tackle or isn't willing to tackle I mean I people
[11:58.240 --> 12:03.000]  are shot and killed every day by people having private handguns well you know
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.560]  people are shot and killed every day in this country by police who are operating
[12:07.560 --> 12:12.280]  under rules of engagement that should never have taken place they're being
[12:12.280 --> 12:17.480]  prompted by the federal government to shoot first that's actually the curriculum
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.080]  that they have in New Mexico the state police academy they had a long time
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.720]  veteran instructor there who refused to teach that who resigned rather than
[12:26.720 --> 12:30.440]  teaching that but those are the rules of engagement that we see being pushed by a
[12:30.440 --> 12:36.280]  government do we want that government to have a monopoly on force do we want to
[12:36.280 --> 12:40.960]  take guns out of the hands of individuals who are behaving responsibly and
[12:40.960 --> 12:46.040]  they completely ignore in this discussion that David Letterman has with
[12:46.040 --> 12:50.960]  Anderson Cooper they completely ignore the root cause as we have pointed out
[12:50.960 --> 12:57.640]  before in every one of these mass murder cases it is always mood altering mind
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.600]  altering behavior altering drugs and in this case in Elliot Rogers we now know
[13:02.600 --> 13:09.200]  that he had an addiction to Xanax what can make someone lose all empathy all
[13:09.200 --> 13:16.600]  sympathy for other human beings what can make them get into a trance like state
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.440]  where they can run over people on the road and just and not be bothered by it
[13:20.440 --> 13:26.880]  they can operate and yet completely have any sense of what they're doing any
[13:26.880 --> 13:32.080]  moral right or wrong completely severed well it's these drugs nobody's going to
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.360]  talk about it why because the big sponsors for David Letterman show as
[13:36.360 --> 13:41.360]  well as the rest of the mainstream media are these pharmaceutical companies we
[13:41.360 --> 13:46.680]  have an entire war on drugs which is turning our government into a predator
[13:46.680 --> 13:53.200]  swat taming people shooting them without warning no knock raids militarized
[13:53.200 --> 13:58.880]  police departments we can have that in the name of a war on illegal drugs but
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.360]  we can't even talk about the murderous side effects of the pharmaceutical drugs
[14:04.360 --> 14:08.920]  that was when they cut Alex Jones off immediately when he went on to Pierce
[14:08.920 --> 14:11.920]  Morgan he could say pretty much anything he wanted to about Pierce Morgan and and
[14:11.920 --> 14:18.000]  guns but when he got on to the murder suicide pills they basically did not
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.640]  bring him back in the next segment why because that's where they get most of
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.640]  their money I want to move on from that to the other big story that's this
[14:26.640 --> 14:31.320]  breaking today of course everyone is talking about Beau Bergdahl and this
[14:31.320 --> 14:35.760]  prisoner exchange there's a lot to talk about here there's a lot to talk about
[14:35.760 --> 14:40.480]  in terms of releasing these people but I think the key thing we need to focus on
[14:40.480 --> 14:45.440]  and what we see people on both the left and the right talking about is the
[14:45.440 --> 14:51.120]  comparisons to Nixon and how he has an imperial presidency he believes that he
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.040]  can do anything he wants and we now see some people floating the idea of
[14:56.040 --> 15:01.280]  impeachment essentially nobody even the Democrats are not backing up Obama for
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.440]  the most part he's starting to get some of his administration people to back him
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.960]  up but even and of course Harry Reid backs him up says no he doesn't have a
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.680]  30-day requirement it's clearly written in the law that he has to give a 30-day
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.160]  notice about this it has to be talked about discussed he did not follow that
[15:18.160 --> 15:23.440]  Jonathan Turley and others have pointed out that he clearly broke the law there
[15:23.440 --> 15:26.720]  is no wiggle room on that and now the question is are they going to do anything
[15:26.720 --> 15:30.700]  about it but let's look at some of the apologists first we've got a clip from
[15:30.700 --> 15:33.880]  Hagel let's listen to what he had to say there's a lot of classified
[15:33.880 --> 15:39.640]  information in in how we got him out when we got him out method used these are
[15:39.640 --> 15:44.800]  these are important classified documents now we're we're sharing these things by
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.680]  the way in classified forums with appropriate committees to your bigger
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.680]  question why now it was our judgment based on the information that we had
[15:54.680 --> 16:02.440]  that his life his health were imperiled and imminently well you say
[16:02.440 --> 16:07.840]  imminently it's easy for us to sit here and look behind and say well 24 hours
[16:07.840 --> 16:13.200]  48 hours it was our judgment and it was unanimous by the way I might add it was
[16:13.200 --> 16:16.600]  a secretary defense secretary of state chairman the joint chiefs of staff
[16:16.600 --> 16:20.440]  director of national intelligence attorney general it all came that we all
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.360]  came the same you know what we hear this over and over again well you know you
[16:24.360 --> 16:27.840]  really just have to trust us on this because this is national security I I
[16:27.840 --> 16:31.360]  would like to tell you really what the basis of this is but I can't really
[16:31.360 --> 16:36.880]  remember when we had the confirmation hearings for the judge that was going that
[16:36.880 --> 16:40.880]  is one level below the Supreme Court a lifetime judge appointment and yet this
[16:40.880 --> 16:46.000]  guy had written memos that supposedly gave legal justification to the drone
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.240]  assassination program but of course in all these years nobody was able to look
[16:51.240 --> 16:56.840]  at those legal memos when Rand Paul and others started to make an issue out of
[16:56.840 --> 17:01.440]  that that this guy had written secret memos to essentially assassinate
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.080]  American citizens abroad justifying that presumably with it some legal
[17:06.080 --> 17:11.320]  argument they said well you're going to point him to a very high court position
[17:11.320 --> 17:16.000]  a lifetime appointment let's see what this guy's legal arguments are and they
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.280]  wouldn't even release it to the Senate for a while finally they released it to
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.120]  the Senate we still have not seen those justifications to the public so we
[17:24.120 --> 17:29.080]  always see that they're going to pull the state secret act that's something
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.760]  that goes all the way down whenever you go in and even talk to somebody at a
[17:32.760 --> 17:36.440]  local police station I can't comment on that it that's you know that's
[17:36.440 --> 17:42.240]  confidential nobody and government will tell us anything the entire government
[17:42.240 --> 17:47.320]  is being run like a star chamber and frankly I'm sick of it we need to start
[17:47.320 --> 17:51.280]  we need to stop this and on this one-year anniversary of the Snowden
[17:51.280 --> 17:55.240]  documents as people are debating you know whether he we see Newt Gingrich
[17:55.240 --> 17:59.080]  talking about is a Snowden a traitor and we see a Democrat say no he's not
[17:59.080 --> 18:02.400]  necessarily a traitor he's just a criminal that needs to go to jail look he
[18:02.400 --> 18:07.840]  exposed criminal actions that are being taken by people in government we need to
[18:07.840 --> 18:13.120]  stop having a star chamber government it's just metastasizing but this is the
[18:13.120 --> 18:18.680]  comment from Obama today he said we saw an opportunity and we seized it I make
[18:18.680 --> 18:23.600]  no apologies for that well when Jonathan Turley went on the Sean Hannity
[18:23.600 --> 18:27.600]  show remember he was on CNN earlier this week talking to Wolf Blitzer and Wolf
[18:27.600 --> 18:30.200]  Blitzer was kind of surprised when he said well you know did the president
[18:30.200 --> 18:34.360]  violate the law and he said clearly he did there isn't any wiggle room with this
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.360]  30-day requirement this is the comment that Turley had on the Sean Hannity show
[18:39.360 --> 18:45.160]  he said what's emerging is an imperial presidency an uber presidency as I've
[18:45.160 --> 18:49.040]  called it where the president can act unilaterally this is only the latest
[18:49.040 --> 18:53.680]  example of that absolutely this is happening all the time even with his
[18:53.680 --> 19:01.000]  own Obamacare regulations he gets his system put in and even that is
[19:01.000 --> 19:06.760]  constantly adjusted as if he is dictator in chief now Turley goes on to say
[19:06.760 --> 19:11.440]  people don't seem to understand that the separation of powers is not about the
[19:11.440 --> 19:16.120]  power of these branches in other words I don't really care fundamentally if the
[19:16.120 --> 19:21.920]  president is more powerful than the Supreme Court or the legislature it's
[19:21.920 --> 19:26.720]  really as he said there to protect individual liberty it's there to
[19:26.720 --> 19:30.800]  protect us from the concentration of power and we need to remember that the
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.240]  divisions and the separations of power were not initially just between the
[19:35.240 --> 19:38.760]  branches of the federal government there was also a separation of power
[19:38.760 --> 19:42.880]  between the federal government the state governments and the people they feared
[19:42.880 --> 19:47.080]  how concentration of power so much and they feared that it would happen in the
[19:47.080 --> 19:51.040]  central branch so much that they divided that power between the states and the
[19:51.040 --> 19:54.480]  people and then within the central government they divided it into three
[19:54.480 --> 19:57.760]  pieces we're gonna be right back we're gonna talk about Obama getting his
[19:57.760 --> 20:02.920]  Nixon on stay with us how long would you last if all grocery stores cease to
[20:02.920 --> 20:08.520]  exist not in America this can't happen in America because my concern about our
[20:08.520 --> 20:12.760]  government I was looking at survival stuff I was raised as a girl scout and
[20:12.760 --> 20:17.680]  their motto is to be prepared for patriots was an opportunity for me to be
[20:17.680 --> 20:22.480]  able to put some things aside I said well this is a product worth having
[20:22.480 --> 20:28.200]  being as it's so good like the pricing for what I got I like the containers they
[20:28.200 --> 20:31.720]  were shipped in if they keep in touch with you you get your emails you get
[20:31.720 --> 20:37.760]  your confirmation customer services just absolutely fantastic plan on buying
[20:37.760 --> 20:45.360]  probably about four more of these minimum thanks for supplying all this stuff
[20:45.360 --> 20:50.120]  for us because I think we're all gonna be needing it in a very short time join
[20:50.120 --> 20:55.040]  over 50,000 Americans who trusted food for patriots go to get survival food
[20:55.040 --> 21:00.360]  calm to learn more that's get survival food calm it's been said those who
[21:00.360 --> 21:05.120]  control the food control the people are you concerned about GMO foods making you

[24:14.480 --> 24:19.640]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight on this Thursday June 5th
[24:19.640 --> 24:27.480]  2014 one year after the first documents from Edward Snowden surfaced what it
[24:27.480 --> 24:32.680]  told us was not just that we had one agency that was violating the law but
[24:32.680 --> 24:39.200]  we have seen in the year that has passed as people have come after Snowden as a
[24:39.200 --> 24:44.600]  criminal for exposing what the government was doing and that was criminal
[24:44.600 --> 24:48.960]  as they have instead of reforming government instead of going after the
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.080]  people who are violating their oaths they've gone after Ed Snowden what we
[24:53.080 --> 24:58.480]  see is a government that embraces the secret surveillance state we've seen
[24:58.480 --> 25:03.720]  how pervasive that is how it goes from the top to the bottom of the government
[25:03.720 --> 25:09.080]  as we see that every part of government from the White House down to local police
[25:09.080 --> 25:13.760]  departments don't believe that not only are they not not accountable to anyone
[25:13.760 --> 25:18.680]  but they don't have to even give us any information about what we're doing to
[25:18.680 --> 25:23.800]  me that is the core thing that we're seeing here it's an arrogance against
[25:23.800 --> 25:27.960]  the people to say that they are not accountable to the Constitution and they
[25:27.960 --> 25:32.400]  are not accountable to the people and we see that in what Obama is doing he
[25:32.400 --> 25:35.400]  doesn't believe that he's accountable to the law to the Constitution to the
[25:35.400 --> 25:40.880]  people to anything and we now see people from both the left and the right who
[25:40.880 --> 25:44.520]  are criticizing him for this and we have Jonathan Turley who was on Sean Hannity
[25:44.520 --> 25:48.520]  I was just reading that quote where he said people don't seem to understand that
[25:48.520 --> 25:52.800]  the separation of powers is not about the power of these branches it's there to
[25:52.800 --> 25:58.440]  protect individual liberty it's there to protect us from the concentration of
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.160]  power he says you know I've said it before Barack Obama is really the
[26:02.160 --> 26:05.920]  president that Richard Nixon always wanted to be you know he's been allowed
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.000]  to act unilaterally in a way that we've been fighting for decades see when you
[26:11.000 --> 26:16.240]  separate power between the central government and the states and the people
[26:16.240 --> 26:19.600]  as was the original design as you separate power between these different
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.760]  branches and government that those are just merely tactics the real target is
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.040]  individual liberty that is the goal and we can't have that when we've got a
[26:30.040 --> 26:34.640]  government that has nothing but contempt for the Constitution for the rule of
[26:34.640 --> 26:40.880]  law now on the right George will had a essay and he pointed out that Richard
[26:40.880 --> 26:46.440]  Nixon famously said to David Frost when the president does it that means it's
[26:46.440 --> 26:51.640]  not illegal doesn't that sound like Barack Obama doesn't that sound like
[26:51.640 --> 26:58.360]  the presidency we have now he goes on to analyze the way that Politico explained
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.360]  what was going on Politico kind of played semantics with what happened they
[27:02.360 --> 27:09.080]  said that Obama's assertive act defied Congress and will points out defied
[27:09.080 --> 27:14.880]  Congress I thought it defied the law that's what they're doing from the
[27:14.880 --> 27:19.000]  Edward Snowden documents showing that the NSA and all these different
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.240]  government agencies are defying the law the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
[27:24.240 --> 27:28.040]  Act that was put in remember that that was put in in the wake of the Church
[27:28.040 --> 27:33.200]  Intelligence Committee hearings back in the 1970s looking at the abuses of the
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.520]  CIA trying to make sure that they did not become a predatory spy agency like
[27:38.520 --> 27:43.120]  East Germany spying on American citizens so they created this spies act and they
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.520]  said we're going to allow you to do intelligence of people that you think
[27:47.520 --> 27:51.360]  maybe enemies the United States abroad but you're not going to do that here
[27:51.360 --> 27:56.520]  domestically and now that has become something of a star chamber court where
[27:56.520 --> 28:01.240]  they can go in and without they call the FISA court a court it's not a court in
[28:01.240 --> 28:07.080]  any way shape or form there is one single person a political appointee who
[28:07.080 --> 28:11.400]  sets there and hears one person from the government it's not an adversarial
[28:11.400 --> 28:16.920]  relationship there there's no transparency there's no public knowledge of
[28:16.920 --> 28:20.960]  what's going on and yet as they have these secret hearings between one judge
[28:20.960 --> 28:24.840]  and one bureaucrat from the administration they believe that these
[28:24.840 --> 28:31.040]  decisions that they come up with have the power to modify our Constitution those
[28:31.040 --> 28:35.160]  are simply head games they're playing with themselves they're engaging in
[28:35.160 --> 28:39.640]  criminal actions and we need to call them on it and fortunately we've seen
[28:39.640 --> 28:43.280]  that over and over again with these Snowden documents people are starting to
[28:43.280 --> 28:48.960]  understand what's going on the question is will we do anything about it the
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.920]  question is will our legislative leaders do anything about Obama's criminal
[28:53.920 --> 28:58.360]  actions now in a story up on info wars today from Alexander Bolton on the hill
[28:58.360 --> 29:04.360]  we see that Lindsey Graham is warning that the Republicans might impeach Obama
[29:04.360 --> 29:10.720]  for what he's done releasing these five Taliban prisoners from Gitmo without
[29:10.720 --> 29:15.520]  following the procedure do you think this is kind of how many times have we
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.760]  heard this before we always see the Republicans come out and say oh this is
[29:19.760 --> 29:24.280]  really bad you know one more time one more time we're gonna do something about
[29:24.280 --> 29:30.160]  it how many times does he have to break the law before they do anything about
[29:30.160 --> 29:34.240]  it now we're gonna take your calls I want to get your take on the Snowden

[34:40.560 --> 34:45.760]  many times we have to work to try to get reform in our government whether
[34:45.760 --> 34:50.040]  that's truth and labeling about GMO whether that's getting fluoride out of
[34:50.040 --> 34:56.320]  the water or whether it's taking action to try to stop the NSA and so we now
[34:56.320 --> 35:02.720]  have on this one-year anniversary of the Ed Snowden documents being revealed
[35:02.720 --> 35:07.480]  showing us what our government has been doing to us in secret we now see that
[35:07.480 --> 35:13.160]  there is a movement foot on the web let's show a little bit of a clip of that
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.720]  to essentially reset it to essentially take the initiative ourselves to do
[35:18.720 --> 35:23.080]  something ourselves to try to take back our freedom that's an important thing
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.160]  we always need to work together collectively for our individual freedoms
[35:27.160 --> 35:30.200]  but understand that there are things that we can do ourselves and so they're
[35:30.200 --> 35:35.440]  trying to appeal as Edward Snowden has to individual developers saying put some
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.400]  features into your app that are going to give some security to your users or if
[35:40.400 --> 35:44.320]  your user take advantage of some of the features that are already there you know
[35:44.320 --> 35:47.420]  for a long time there was an app out there going all the way back to the
[35:47.420 --> 35:51.480]  days of echelon back in the 1990s people knew that the government was
[35:51.480 --> 35:54.620]  collecting people who were informed who are following things knew that the
[35:54.620 --> 35:59.200]  government was collecting information on American citizens and so some people
[35:59.200 --> 36:02.920]  made some tools available like PGP that's pretty good privacy it was a
[36:02.920 --> 36:07.560]  personal encryption method that would allow you to encrypt your emails we
[36:07.560 --> 36:11.680]  know that if everybody starts encrypting their emails it's going to be very
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.120]  difficult for the NSA to do something about it of course it's an ongoing war
[36:17.120 --> 36:22.800]  they will adapt as we adapt but at least let's resist let's at least do
[36:22.800 --> 36:25.680]  something let's play a little bit of a clip for people on radio we've been
[36:25.680 --> 36:29.640]  showing some video from their their campaign let's play a little bit about
[36:29.640 --> 36:31.760]  it
[36:42.880 --> 36:47.480]  we use the internet to be ourselves but governments are building a prison around
[36:47.480 --> 36:54.240]  it we have to stop them but how they seem so vast and powerful but government
[36:54.240 --> 36:58.920]  spies have a weakness they can hack anybody but they can't hack everybody
[36:58.920 --> 37:04.380]  folks like the NSA depend on collecting insecure data from tapped fiber they
[37:04.380 --> 37:11.800]  depend on our mistakes mistakes we can fix the plan reset the net together on
[37:11.800 --> 37:17.760]  June 5th one year after Snowden's first NSA story we all take one powerful step
[37:17.760 --> 37:23.520]  to turn off government spying and turn on freedom the call is simple find some
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.800]  territory of the internet that you can protect from prying eyes seize it and
[37:27.800 --> 37:33.000]  hold it are you a developer promise to add one NSA resistant feature to your
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.400]  app are you an internet user promise to try one NSA resistant privacy tool okay
[37:39.400 --> 37:44.200]  now that's the campaign you can find that it's a hashtag reset the net it's a
[37:44.200 --> 37:49.240]  campaign and their motto is don't ask for privacy take it back I think we should
[37:49.240 --> 37:52.720]  do that with everything whether it's our own personal food supply or drinking
[37:52.720 --> 37:56.880]  water our right to keep him bare arms there's so many different things that we
[37:56.880 --> 38:03.960]  can do especially I would add juries we see trial by jury as well as even a
[38:03.960 --> 38:08.440]  trial by a judge is something that is starting to disappear from our country
[38:08.440 --> 38:11.800]  so we need to take these things back as we can we also need to work
[38:11.800 --> 38:15.280]  collectively to try to stop it I'm gonna go to your calls here in just a
[38:15.280 --> 38:20.160]  moment try to get your get your take on what Obama is doing as he becomes
[38:20.160 --> 38:24.640]  essentially the reincarnation of Richard Nixon but I also want to talk to you
[38:24.640 --> 38:29.680]  about Snowden where you think we could head with that besides resetting the net
[38:29.680 --> 38:34.360]  what do we do to take this back there's been a lot of ground covered in the last
[38:34.360 --> 38:38.880]  year about educating the public that's a very positive thing now what do we do to
[38:38.880 --> 38:44.080]  take action I want to talk about how meet the press is debating the
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.040]  importance of Snowden now we saw just this last couple of days it was on June
[38:49.040 --> 38:55.680]  1st on the Sunday show they had Newt Gingrich and a Democrat former
[38:55.680 --> 38:59.960]  congressperson Harman talking about it listen this quote from Gingrich he said
[38:59.960 --> 39:05.560]  what right does any single American have to decide that more than the president
[39:05.560 --> 39:11.320]  more than the Congress that they're going to leak our secrets this is the
[39:11.320 --> 39:18.880]  act of a traitor what Snowden leaked were the traitorous acts of our president of
[39:18.880 --> 39:24.160]  our Congress of our NSA of our bureaucracies there was an article that
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.880]  broke when I was in Europe about the national health system in Britain there
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.960]  was a whistleblower there that exposed the fact that in the areas that he was
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.000]  working they had children and seniors who were locked away for 12 hours a day
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.280]  without any food or water now the response of these people was to was it
[39:45.280 --> 39:50.600]  to thank him was it to put the people in jail that had been doing this to fire
[39:50.600 --> 39:56.160]  them to do anything to them no what they did was they fired the whistleblower we
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.720]  see that happening over and over again people who expose criminal activity on
[40:01.720 --> 40:06.400]  the part of the government are not criminals that's what Ed Snowden did
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.840]  now the Democrat Harman said well you know Snowden should come back he should
[40:10.840 --> 40:14.880]  cut a deal he should serve prison time I think that's where this should come out
[40:14.880 --> 40:20.440]  this ought to be a lesson to other kids watch out this is very dangerous yes
[40:20.440 --> 40:26.080]  it's very dangerous to expose the illegal actions the criminal actions of a
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.760]  criminal government that will not reform itself now one of the other pieces of
[40:31.760 --> 40:35.320]  fallout that's happening of course in Snowden is that American corporations are
[40:35.320 --> 40:39.640]  finding that it's much harder for them to do business and in China the Wall
[40:39.640 --> 40:44.840]  Street Journal just pointed out that Chinese state television ran a very
[40:44.840 --> 40:50.440]  empty Microsoft segment now of course Microsoft was one of the early adopters
[40:50.440 --> 40:54.520]  of the prism program they were the first ones in there they were in there long
[40:54.520 --> 40:58.760]  before the other corporations got in there they've been linked at the hip
[40:58.760 --> 41:03.520]  with the surveillance state with a security state here in America a Chinese
[41:03.520 --> 41:07.920]  state TV broadcast they say on Wall Street Journal laid into the Microsoft
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.760]  and its Windows 8 operating system on Wednesday saying the amount of personal
[41:11.760 --> 41:16.400]  data the systems capable of collecting and the profile of Chinese society it
[41:16.400 --> 41:21.160]  would be capable of producing would quote be more precise and up to date than
[41:21.160 --> 41:25.960]  that collected by our own National Bureau of Statistics they said we've seen
[41:25.960 --> 41:31.440]  that the USA has relevant acts like the Patriot Act that oblige companies that
[41:31.440 --> 41:35.080]  hold information resources to transfer that to the US government that's the
[41:35.080 --> 41:39.920]  message that people are getting about our corporations they need to distance
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.560]  themselves in a real way people are not buying their phony
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.880]  misinformation saying that they really weren't part of the prism program people
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.280]  don't buy that and it's costing them dearly and that's going to continue to
[41:53.280 --> 41:59.240]  go on until companies like Microsoft actually push back but don't hold your
[41:59.240 --> 42:06.760]  breath we see that even in places like Florida small town sheriff departments
[42:06.760 --> 42:10.760]  it's not just at the top we see this kind of corruption it's even down at the
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.160]  local police departments and it's being driven by our federal government they're
[42:15.160 --> 42:19.440]  the ones who are offering sweetheart deals on all this heavy equipment that
[42:19.440 --> 42:23.400]  is militarizing our police as if they're going to be fighting a war in Iraq or
[42:23.400 --> 42:28.280]  Afghanistan and so we see this story about US Marshals seizing cops spying
[42:28.280 --> 42:31.920]  records to keep them from the ACLU this is one that was picked up by the drugs
[42:31.920 --> 42:36.000]  reports from Wired magazine they say a routine request in Florida for public
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.200]  records regarding the use of surveillance tool known as stingray and we've
[42:39.200 --> 42:42.480]  reported on that several times here at Info Wars took an extraordinary turn
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.400]  recently when federal authorities sees the documents before the police could
[42:46.400 --> 42:51.720]  release them now under court order they were going to be given these documents
[42:51.720 --> 42:55.960]  over to the ACLU which was challenging it essentially what they're doing is they
[42:55.960 --> 43:00.600]  are tracking and surveilling people without a court order without a warrant
[43:00.600 --> 43:04.040]  in other words the police departments and many of these are local police
[43:04.040 --> 43:08.280]  departments a lot of it is happening in Florida they're illegally surveilling
[43:08.280 --> 43:14.040]  people without getting a search warrant now to keep that information from being
[43:14.040 --> 43:18.520]  turned over they point out the ACLU point ACLU points out that several
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.400]  times the feds have come in doing everything they can to prevent that
[43:22.400 --> 43:25.640]  information from being turned over let me tell you just a little bit about
[43:25.640 --> 43:30.360]  what stingray is okay it's essentially a way for them to triangulate your
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.080]  position using cell phone data and they're saying well because it's just
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.760]  your cell phone data it's just metadata and that doesn't really apply that's
[43:38.760 --> 43:42.540]  baloney that's metalized I'd say they're
[43:42.540 --> 43:48.440]  pervericating around the bush listen if they can profile everything about your
[43:48.440 --> 43:52.280]  personal habits using metadata that's just as good as if they're going to
[43:52.280 --> 43:55.840]  actually read your email or if they're going to listen to you and we know that
[43:55.840 --> 43:59.480]  they're doing that too we know they're doing that we've been telling you that
[43:59.480 --> 44:02.480]  they're doing that whistleblowers have been telling you that they're doing that
[44:02.480 --> 44:05.240]  we know they're doing that when they come in and say we're only getting
[44:05.240 --> 44:08.840]  metadata that's a lie but if they were only getting metadata if that were
[44:08.840 --> 44:13.200]  really true that would be a violation but here's the thing that really bothers
[44:13.200 --> 44:18.560]  me about this the explanation from the Tallahassee police department said even
[44:18.560 --> 44:20.800]  that nurses the police department according to the Wall Street Journal
[44:20.800 --> 44:25.080]  article said they'd used sting rate at least 200 times since 2010 without
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.640]  telling any judge and here's their reason the device manufacturer made the
[44:30.640 --> 44:35.640]  police department sign a non-disclosure agreement that the police claim prevents
[44:35.640 --> 44:40.920]  them from disclosing what they're going to do to the courts think about that
[44:40.920 --> 44:45.200]  think about that they're saying that they signed a paper with a corporation
[44:45.200 --> 44:50.760]  that they're not going to disclose this information to a judge as required of
[44:50.760 --> 44:55.960]  under the law under the Constitution that their non-disclosure agreement with
[44:55.960 --> 45:00.520]  this corporation is more important than the Constitution or any laws that we
[45:00.520 --> 45:05.160]  write subsequent to that that's what they're saying I mean could it be any
[45:05.160 --> 45:10.160]  clear that we have a corporate fascist surveillance state here that a military
[45:10.160 --> 45:13.920]  industrial complex company and that's their new profit center is the police
[45:13.920 --> 45:19.200]  state that they can come in and have a police department sign this paper saying
[45:19.200 --> 45:22.720]  you can't tell a judge if you're going to actually be using this and the
[45:22.720 --> 45:26.880]  police use that as an excuse those people ought to all go to jail this is
[45:26.880 --> 45:32.520]  absolutely amazing that they would do something like this let's go to your go
[45:32.520 --> 45:37.320]  to your phone calls we've got Ashley in Wisconsin Ashley go ahead
[45:37.320 --> 45:43.320]  Hi, how's it going today? I'm fine. I actually saw an article in Vice News
[45:43.320 --> 45:48.000]  under war and conflict section that I found very interesting and the
[45:48.000 --> 45:52.680]  highlight of it was why was the FBI investigating Michael Hastings reporting
[45:52.680 --> 45:56.720]  on Bull Bergdahl and I didn't know I'm not sure if you guys are aware that Michael
[45:56.720 --> 46:03.360]  Hastings actually did a plot report on Bull Bergdahl and it's actually titled
[46:03.360 --> 46:09.880]  America's Poll Goodness I just had and it's very interesting that I did not know that
[46:09.880 --> 46:13.360]  Michael Hastings was actually reporting on Bull Bergdahl. Oh yeah we're very aware of it.
[46:13.360 --> 46:18.120]  Yeah our our Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs he was the one that Michael Hastings was
[46:18.120 --> 46:22.560]  embedded with and and he knows quite a bit about the Bergdahl case he said
[46:22.560 --> 46:25.680]  had several reports about it actually we've got a special report from the
[46:25.680 --> 46:29.000]  nightly news last night that we're gonna be running later on in the show from
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.680]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs. Okay so yeah that was very interesting. I hope they know about that.
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.080]  That's a very interesting connection to the two. Yes yes yes thank you for
[46:39.080 --> 46:46.640]  bringing that up. Yes let's go to Brian in Arizona. Brian. Yeah hey I just want to
[46:46.640 --> 46:53.480]  touch base on the six terrorists that got released and my my feeling of it all
[46:53.480 --> 46:58.120]  is that he had no idea who the hell the person was he let go if they did know
[46:58.120 --> 47:05.960]  it's complete treason and the only threat that we have to our country is the
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.440]  Obama administration. Most of all Harry Reid keeps shutting everything down and
[47:10.440 --> 47:15.600]  blaming it on the you know on the Republicans which Republicans are
[47:15.600 --> 47:20.600]  spineless you name it. We can go on and on about that. Well of course we've known for a
[47:20.600 --> 47:26.520]  long time that they they essentially created Al Qaeda. They called them something
[47:26.520 --> 47:29.320]  else when they started when they were fighting the Russians. They called Mu Mu
[47:29.320 --> 47:33.120]  Shahadeen but you know that this is something that our government creates a
[47:33.120 --> 47:37.280]  threat and then they offer the solution whether it's 9-11 whether it's the
[47:37.280 --> 47:42.200]  Al Qaeda terrorist they create the boogeyman and then they come to us to
[47:42.200 --> 47:46.320]  with a solution that they've already developed and so I think the biggest
[47:46.320 --> 47:53.160]  thing about this is that we need to stop tolerating this breaking of the law by
[47:53.160 --> 47:58.680]  the present. How many times does this have to go on before he's impeached? How can
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.120]  we stop it? And they're not going to do it. Throw the race card in there again.
[48:03.120 --> 48:07.560]  Exactly. Is there some general somewhere that can stop this? Is there anything? It's
[48:07.560 --> 48:11.040]  got to be we the people. We got to stand up. We got to vote. We got to do what we
[48:11.040 --> 48:16.040]  can do to get this God awful mess off the table. Well that's true. I think just like
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.440]  with the Snowden leaks I mean we can't go in and physically arrest NSA. We can't
[48:21.440 --> 48:24.680]  physically go in and shut them down and as long as we have a government that
[48:24.680 --> 48:28.600]  wants to do this there's not a great deal that we can do other than things like
[48:28.600 --> 48:33.880]  this reset the web. We can do things to resist it on a personal level. We can get
[48:33.880 --> 48:38.640]  active and we can educate people about jury nullification. We can shut it down.
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.440]  It only takes one of us in a jury to shut down the war on drugs which is really
[48:43.440 --> 48:47.640]  where this police state started a couple of decades ago. They've now rolled it
[48:47.640 --> 48:52.040]  into a war on terror but one person setting on a jury can shut this down.
[48:52.040 --> 48:55.880]  That's the beauty of the jury system. That's one of the most powerful things
[48:55.880 --> 48:59.520]  we have as a people and so there are things that we can do to protect
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.640]  ourselves individually, to protect our family and even to stand up for the
[49:03.640 --> 49:06.360]  rights of people who are on trial but most people don't want to be bothered
[49:06.360 --> 49:11.040]  with the jury trial and jury trials are so rare that most people will go in and
[49:11.040 --> 49:15.400]  take a plea bargain rather than trust their fellow jurors. So yeah I don't
[49:15.400 --> 49:19.560]  really know what we do. Thank you Brian and Arizona. Let's go to Billy in
[49:19.560 --> 49:26.280]  California Billy. David I wanted to start off by saying I agree with you guys on
[49:26.280 --> 49:30.480]  about 90% of everything that you guys cover and I think that you guys do a
[49:30.480 --> 49:36.680]  great job. Having said that I think I disagree with you guys on on something
[49:36.680 --> 49:41.720]  that you guys are a big thing that you're missing. I think that you guys are
[49:41.720 --> 49:46.640]  missing a huge conspiracy and the conspiracy is evolution. I mean so many
[49:46.640 --> 49:52.840]  Christians out there still believe in evolution. They believe that the Earth
[49:52.840 --> 49:57.360]  is billions of years old and that you know we evolved from monkeys. You know
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.640]  basically saying that Genesis is completely not true. Yeah I don't
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.080]  believe that frankly. You know I believe in special creation. I take the Bible
[50:06.080 --> 50:12.400]  literally and I don't have any problem with defending that. I mean you know there
[50:12.400 --> 50:18.720]  are the key message of the Bible is what Christ did for us. But of course when
[50:18.720 --> 50:21.840]  you start talking about creation versus evolution what you're really talking
[50:21.840 --> 50:25.680]  about is do we really believe the authority of the Bible? Are we going to
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.680]  go into science that is continually changing and are we going to then try to
[50:30.680 --> 50:35.200]  read that back into the text in order to get the Bible to agree with whatever
[50:35.200 --> 50:39.160]  the science of the day says. I don't agree with that. I take it literally. I
[50:39.160 --> 50:44.040]  don't have a problem with that. If God can raise a man and from the dead in
[50:44.040 --> 50:48.680]  three days I think he can create the Earth in any time that he wants to. So
[50:48.680 --> 50:51.280]  we're going to be right back. We're going to take some of your calls. We're all over
[50:51.280 --> 50:55.080]  the map. All different things. I would like to take some calls on Ed Snowden.

[52:14.080 --> 52:18.880]  a quick buck. Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was
[52:18.880 --> 52:23.520]  born. MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding. They

[54:10.240 --> 54:14.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. We're talking about a variety of subjects
[54:14.320 --> 54:18.720]  today. We're talking about Obama's arrogance about how he's channeling
[54:18.720 --> 54:23.760]  Richard Nixon. As Nixon said, if the president says it, it's not against the
[54:23.760 --> 54:28.000]  law. And that's essentially what we're seeing Obama. He thinks, you know, a
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.600]  dictator is essentially somebody who just speaks the law out of his mouth. And
[54:33.600 --> 54:39.000]  evidently that's what Obama thinks. He's a dictator. He changes Obamacare as he
[54:39.000 --> 54:45.000]  wishes. He ignores the laws within the NDAA that he signed. And we have a lot of
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.720]  problems with what he signed. But whenever he violates it, the Republicans
[54:49.720 --> 54:53.920]  just let him get away with it. They try to make a few cheap points as far as, with
[54:53.920 --> 54:58.760]  their base, as far as election purposes go. But essentially, they think that
[54:58.760 --> 55:02.280]  they're going to get the reins of power and they want all the power that he has.
[55:02.280 --> 55:06.960]  They're not about cutting back the power that the president has assumed or the
[55:06.960 --> 55:10.840]  power that the central government has assumed. They want that power in
[55:10.840 --> 55:18.240]  Washington. So we're taking your calls at 800-259-9231. This is also the one-year
[55:18.240 --> 55:24.960]  anniversary of the first leaks of Ed Snowden exposing criminal activities by
[55:24.960 --> 55:29.840]  a criminal and secret government that believes that everyone, not just our
[55:29.840 --> 55:33.040]  president, but everyone in the bureaucracy, everyone in the Senate,
[55:33.040 --> 55:38.360]  everyone in the House of Representatives is essentially above the law. So I want
[55:38.360 --> 55:41.360]  to get your comments on that. Terry in Virginia, what do you think about
[55:41.360 --> 55:47.440]  Snowden? Ed Snowden? Yes. Yes. What do you think about the Snowden leaks? What's
[55:47.440 --> 55:52.200]  your take on this, on the one-year anniversary? Well, I have thoughts on the
[55:52.200 --> 55:56.880]  very beginning that Ed Snowden was a hero. From the very first time I heard
[55:56.880 --> 56:03.200]  about what he did, I never doubted that, you know, what he was doing was really
[56:03.200 --> 56:13.400]  for the United States people and not trying to be, you know, a traitor. Right.
[56:13.400 --> 56:21.440]  That's where they were trying to think of. And also, I like to have such a problem
[56:21.440 --> 56:25.680]  with people saying, oh, you know, my mind is flying on me because I don't have
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.840]  anything to hide. And my stepson said that to me just recently and I said, well,
[56:29.840 --> 56:33.840]  how would you feel if there was a peep and thong standing outside your window,
[56:33.840 --> 56:37.960]  even if he was dressed in a police uniform? Yes. And they're watching you. How would
[56:37.960 --> 56:42.040]  you feel about that? Exactly. I'd go out there and I'd beat his butt is what he
[56:42.040 --> 56:46.240]  said. And I said, well, it's no different. What's different about it?
[56:46.240 --> 56:49.560]  Alex has used that analogy many times. Why do we even wear clothes? You know,
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.280]  shouldn't everything that we have be available to the government? If you
[56:53.280 --> 56:56.440]  understand human nature, you understand that giving somebody that kind of power
[56:56.440 --> 57:02.200]  is incredibly dangerous and it will be abused. William Binney was a guest on our
[57:02.200 --> 57:05.680]  show. We interviewed him. And of course, he was one of the early NSA whistleblowers.
[57:05.680 --> 57:09.880]  He was involved as the global technical head. In other words, he was the head
[57:09.880 --> 57:13.320]  technical person at the NSA for quite a long time. He worked there for over 30
[57:13.320 --> 57:18.120]  years and he had global responsibilities. And what he told us on this
[57:18.120 --> 57:24.760]  program when I interviewed him, he said, I've seen this in East Germany. I've seen
[57:24.760 --> 57:29.200]  this in the Soviet Union. In the early days when he worked for the NSA, that's
[57:29.200 --> 57:33.400]  what they did. They spied on people that were perceived to be a threat to the US
[57:33.400 --> 57:39.440]  government abroad. And he's very concerned when that surveillance apparatus, that spy
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.800]  machine, turns inward on the American people and starts surveilling the most
[57:43.800 --> 57:50.000]  minute details of their lives, compiling dossiers on every individual in the
[57:50.000 --> 57:55.220]  country. When you allow the government to do that, you will find that they will
[57:55.220 --> 57:59.640]  intimidate people, that they will shut down debate, and people will be intimidated
[57:59.640 --> 58:02.760]  just by knowing that the government is watching them. They will shut up and they
[58:02.760 --> 58:08.360]  won't do anything. So it's a very, very dangerous thing. The other thing that
[58:08.360 --> 58:12.840]  happens is you find that they can blackmail very high-level government
[58:12.840 --> 58:18.200]  officials. We've seen some very unusual things, some unusual behavior from
[58:18.200 --> 58:23.300]  Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts on Obamacare. Many people, even before the
[58:23.300 --> 58:28.000]  NSA leaks, believe that perhaps he was being blackmailed. We're gonna be right
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.320]  back. We're gonna talk about the Snowden leaks. We're also going to talk about
[58:31.320 --> 58:36.080]  European Central Banks going with negative interest rates. What does that
[58:36.080 --> 58:48.880]  about? Stay tuned. We'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[59:00.720 --> 59:05.040]  know? If not, then I want to know why. Oh, I know it's tough to talk about this with
[59:05.040 --> 59:08.680]  some people. They might call you names, or they just want to talk about sports.
[59:08.680 --> 59:13.640]  They're so poprous. I say, so what? There's a battle going on out there right now. The
[59:13.640 --> 59:18.000]  ammunition is information, and the soldiers are you. It's time to transform
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.240]  your game from passive listener to active participant. We from Scotland have
[59:22.240 --> 59:25.960]  had our skin in this game for the greater part of the last thousand years, and I'm
[59:25.960 --> 59:30.040]  still fighting. If we don't all stand up right now, we're gonna lose everything.

[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:21.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:26.720]  Jones. Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, and we are here on
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:33.560]  Thursday, June 5th, 2014, the one-year anniversary of these first documents from
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.880]  Edward Snowden that I think have done a lot to wake up the American public, and
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:43.000]  the question is, though, are we going to do something about it, or are we going to
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.040]  just become adjusted to it? Is it going to become the new normal? Because now,
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:53.920]  it's almost become passe, to say that the government is watching us. When we were
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.120]  saying it, when Alex Jones was saying it for years, for decades, people would laugh
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.480]  at him as being a conspiracy theorist. We had whistleblowers from the NSA in the
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.680]  early 2000s, about 10 years before the Snowden leaks, telling us what was
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.880]  happening, that the surveillance state was moving from looking at possible
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.800]  terrorists and spies abroad to turning inward on the American people, compiling
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:22.520]  vast dossiers on people who were not suspected of any crime. What's that about?
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.120]  Let's take a look at one of the older reports that we had throughout this last
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:32.080]  year about Ed Snowden, and then we're going to take your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.480]  Let's go to that report. Well, Obama's defense of the NSA's constant
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.720]  surveillance of all Americans just reached a new level of uncertainty when he
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.680]  compared them to Paul Revere. After blatantly lying, even they realized they
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.400]  don't have any credibility. We're putting out mindless propaganda is what some of
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.000]  us feel that we're putting out, and that what the American people feel that we're
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.400]  putting out. What's a tyrant to do? Well, you could pull in some corporate
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:03.240]  billionaires who work hand-in-glove with the NSA. I'm sure that would help. So it's
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:10.240]  not as though government surveillance is absolutely bad in all cases. Is it
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:17.960]  done in a way that people trust that the normal privacy concerns are being
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:21.640]  adhered to? It's interesting that Gates would be talking about trust.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.720]  Microsoft was the first company to partner with the NSA on violating your
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:31.200]  trust and spying on you without reason and without a warrant. Internet companies
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.680]  want you to trust them with your data, and the government wants you to give your
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.640]  data to a third party like Microsoft so they can get that data without a search
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.440]  warrant. They merely ask companies like Microsoft and Microsoft eagerly turns
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.920]  over all of your information. But it's not just Gates with soothing words for the
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.960]  public. Mark Andreessen, Netscape founder, now venture capitalist, took to Twitter
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.200]  this week to defend the NSA, and government cheerleaders in the press
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:01.360]  were relieved that finally someone had the guts to defend the NSA. Andreessen
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:05.960]  tweeted, I increasingly feel like we're on some gigantic collective fainting
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:12.160]  couch. Oh my word, I can't believe that spy agencies spy. In the U.S. we all
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.960]  collectively hired tens of thousands of our fellow citizens and gave them 75
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.720]  billion dollars a year with a mission to spy on our behalf. Do you notice the
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.840]  subtle lie here? It's not that the NSA is spying on our behalf, it's that they're
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:34.280]  spying on us illegally. He completely loses the context of FISA. The F stands
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.360]  for foreign and it was created because we learned in the 70s during the Church
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.800]  Commission that spy agencies weren't just spying, they were engaged in all kinds
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.400]  of criminal activity as well. The purpose of FISA was to restrict the CIA and the
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.960]  NSA from spying domestically. But Andreessen tries to confuse the issue further
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.320]  by saying, to suddenly turn on them and blanket accuse them of comprehensive
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:02.600]  illegality and moral horrors is unfair to them and it lets us off the hook. Is it
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.760]  unfair to accuse the NSA of comprehensive illegality when they lie to
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:12.160]  Congress, when they violate FISA and the Constitution and spy on all Americans
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.160]  without a search warrant? Andreessen has been trying to cover for the NSA from the
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.880]  very beginning of the Snowden leaks, trying to muddy the waters by claiming
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:23.960]  that the NSA critics are too stupid to understand the technology involved.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.640]  American citizens as well as not American citizens direct access, no oversight, no
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.960]  court order, these very sweeping claims. The things that are frustrating from my
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.840]  perspective is the sort of issue of technology in our society and the
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.960]  internet in our society is a central issue and to talk about it you actually
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.320]  have to, people have to understand the technology, people have to actually be
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.520]  willing to understand the technology and the original reporting simply did not
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.760]  understand the technology. Andreessen saying critics simply don't understand
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:53.280]  technology couldn't be a bigger lie. Multiple NSA whistleblowers told us
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:03.240]  about illegal surveillance 12 years ago. In the near future, when you realize how
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.160]  fake it all is, the football, the basketball, security, alert, this is
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:13.280]  Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building independent media operation.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.280]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.

[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.440]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:10.360]  contaminate. What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking

[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:17.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I am David Knight and here we are on the one
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.320]  year anniversary of the Ed Snowden documents, the very first documents that
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:25.000]  were leaked and of course there's been a steady stream of documents over the last
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.320]  year. It's now almost become passe for people to say hey the government's
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.880]  spying on us. Are we going to get adjusted to that? Are we going to accept that? Are
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.600]  we going to love our slavery? Or are we going to push back? Some people have a
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.480]  reset the net campaign. Hashtag reset the net, it's reset the net.org. Try to
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.760]  encourage people to take individual action just as we encourage you to take
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.840]  individual action when it comes to water fluoridation or GMO in your food. There
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.920]  are certain things that you can do but we also want to work together
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:02.520]  collectively to try to get individual liberty and so I want to get your
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.280]  comments on this one year anniversary of the beginning of the Snowden
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:10.000]  documents. Of course they have promised Glenn Greenwall has promised that he is
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.960]  going to as kind of a grand finale he's going to release a list of all the
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:18.640]  people that the NSA has been targeting. I'm going to be very disappointed if I'm
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.840]  not on that list. How about you? If we're not on that list maybe we're not doing
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:27.880]  enough to speak out to educate to push back against this. They're spying on
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.200]  everybody so why aren't we on that list? I want to take your comments. We've got
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.200]  Francis in North Carolina. You had a comment about Snowden. Go ahead. Hi
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.800]  David. Hi. When I first learned about Snowden doing this deal I thought you
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.160]  know finally someone's actually showing they got testicle 42 to actually
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.080]  present to the people was really being done to them and especially from the
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:56.200]  backside of the situation. Quite frankly it's like it's about bloody time. Of course
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.000]  at that time when I made that comment the people they thought I was absolutely out
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  of my mind. I'd lost it for that matter. It was basically a traitor and quite
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.920]  frankly the politicians the alphabet soup agencies and all that they are the
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.760]  actual traitors to start with. I couldn't agree with you more. Yeah now the
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:18.800]  sad part is that mind you when Obama actually went into a campaign to go into
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.520]  office I figured he had to be better than the shrub or whoever was before him as
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:29.240]  far as this processor is concerned. So I'm making an obvious confession
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.920]  about this is that the first time I actually campaigned to try to help him
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:38.480]  get elected. Not realizing just how big of a screw deal he was because
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.240]  shortly after he got into office everything went downhill. Now what I'm trying to
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:48.800]  figure out is just like with Bush Jr. how it is that people would go and vote. Well
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.960]  actually I realized that people didn't really vote for him because voting
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.200]  machines were rigged at that time. The fact that Obama got in the second time
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:02.280]  for a second term. So it's like you know something when you got voting machines
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:08.280]  that are riggable and all that computer wise or whatnot are hacked into it's
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.680]  really you're cutting your own throat by allowing the corporations to go and do
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.720]  that to you and people being on the illusion that their vote counts. If it did
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.280]  then withdraw it because they don't deserve it and never did. Well that's
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.080]  true it's always a question you know do we participate in the system that is
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.480]  rigged from the very beginning. I mean I was involved in third-party politics I
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.200]  know that they cut off access to the debates they cut off access to the
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.600]  ballots for most people. We don't have a multi-party elections in this country
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.520]  anymore and then of course they control how the votes are counted they control
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.840]  the custody of the votes they control the totaling of the votes or control the
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.040]  reporting of the votes. There are so many different places where they can
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:57.320]  essentially come in and corrupt it. So it's a very difficult system to make a
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:00.200]  decision as to whether you're going to participate in it or whether you're
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.240]  going to boycott it. I understand there's arguments for both sides. I mean
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.760]  personally I like to always get in there and fight something as opposed to just
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.600]  stepping back it seems like stepping back is a passive thing to do but I
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.800]  accept the other argument. I really believe though that where we're going
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.160]  to make headway is if we understand certain things like jury nullification.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.160]  If you're one of 12 people or in some cases six people depending on what they
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:33.960]  do you have a real opportunity to shut down the the bad law or shut down a
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.740]  draconian application or maybe maybe you fundamentally agree with it but
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:43.960]  you don't agree with the penalties that are involved in it. But basically we
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.560]  can if we exercise those powers and essentially jury trials are all but dead
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.960]  anymore and we're now getting to the point where as we've learned from some
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.960]  of these Snowden leaks that we don't even have a court system anymore. There
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.960]  was just an article I've got this right here on my desk this came out earlier
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.840]  this week sealed court files this is from the Wall Street Journal online
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.840]  sealed court files obscure a rise in electronic surveillance and this is right
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:13.680]  here in Texas this is a federal magistrate drudge judge sorry Brian
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.840]  Owensley who approved scores of government requests for electronic
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.240]  surveillance in connection with criminal investigations and then he sealed them at
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:26.520]  the request of the government. He was bothered by that so after he retired last
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.760]  year he went back to unseal more than 100 of his secret orders. Now these are
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.400]  things that along with the government's legal justification for their surveillance
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.480]  these were not things like terrorism these are things like bank robbery drug
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:45.680]  trafficking they were not state secrets he said. A senior judge halted the effort
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:50.080]  with a one paragraph order that offered no explanation for the decision. Now this
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.320]  judge is saying that he thinks it's like something out of Kafka. He's very
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.240]  concerned about this that we have such a secretive society and I think that's one
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.000]  of the key things that's come out of the Snowden documents is for people to
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.080]  understand that the government is shutting off all transparency all
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.080]  information about everything that they're doing that is an incredibly
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.880]  incredibly dangerous thing and let me tell you where this is going to head. And
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.280]  the Guardian today there was an article from Owen Jones and he says Britain's
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:26.800]  first secret trial this is the way of trouble this way lies trouble and he says
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:34.040]  that they had two men who are known only as A.D. and C.D. for people that have
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.760]  ever watched any of the cartoon kids cartoons it sounds like bananas and
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.560]  pajamas you know B1 and B2 my kids used to see that when they were very young he
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.080]  said they've been charged with terrorism this these two people A.B. and C.D.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.360]  journalists were forbidden from disclosing even that simple fact until
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.860]  newspapers overturned a gagging order for the first time in centuries in a
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:04.160]  direct challenge to the Magna Carta of 1215 the entire trial will be held in
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:10.040]  secrecy do you understand this is where we're going we are overturning hundreds
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:17.560]  of years of tradition that protects individual liberties star chambers secret
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:23.080]  proceedings people not being allowed to have a jury this is where we're headed
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:26.360]  with this police state they're surveilling people they're going they've
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.480]  already passed the NDAA where they can indefinitely detain people even without
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.640]  a trial so they can either have a secret trial or they can have no trial at all
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.160]  and he points out this is a quote from somebody named Shammy Chakrabarty I
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.360]  don't know who that is somebody from the UK they says transparency isn't an
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:50.160]  optional luxury in the justice system it's the key to ensuring fairness and
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.080]  protecting the rule of law and then they can have a couple of examples they
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.120]  say this same government that's now in power in the UK passed a justice and
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.040]  security act just last year that instead of judges they allow ministers to be
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.880]  given power over evidence in court risking the principle of a fair trial and
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.880]  it goes all the way back to Margaret Thatcher in 1986 she had a public order
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.040]  act what happened with that was they criminalized words or behavior that would
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.600]  cause harassment alarm or distress he points out who would have thought when
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.740]  that was passed that it would eventually be used against a wide range of groups
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:31.240]  all the way from gay rights activists to Christian street preachers just a public
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:35.640]  order act saying that you can't use harassing speech or speech that's going
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.000]  to cause alarm or distress then they give one more example here that says
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.200]  neither did proponents of the terrorism act suggest that the source of people on
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.200]  the receiving end would include an octogenarian refugee called Walter Wolfgang
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.400]  who had fled the Nazis and had the temerity to hackle a minister so he gets
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.440]  hit with the anti-terrorism act that's what we're seeing in America with the
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.520]  Patriot Act that's what we're seeing with the FISA court which is secretly
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.760]  holding these trials and we were told that Obama was going to be the most
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.880]  transparent president we'd ever had he campaigned on transparency he has been a
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:18.440]  transparent fraud he's been a transparent dictator many people on the left have the
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.960]  honesty to stand up and say that to point that out but many people just as we
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:27.600]  see with Republicans have more allegiance to their political party than
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.440]  they do to principle and so that's why we see all these people lining up and
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.080]  lockstep behind him so far that hasn't really happened with the Bergdahl case
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.680]  we'll see if that's something that's going to they're going to change so far
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.400]  we've only seen Harry Reid go in and support him a hundred percent on this
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.000]  everybody else has tried to distance him even themselves from him even Diane
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.680]  Feinstein has said that he broke the law well if he broke the law when are we
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.600]  going to do something about it I don't know let's go to the right to bear arms
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:05.400]  and FEMA Camp FEMA region number 10 David exactly that's what I was gonna
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.840]  speak to you about we need to link up and watch what they do with Edward
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:14.360]  Snowden I saw a link to the drug report that said possibly he might make a trip
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:21.120]  back to the US also with Bo Bergdahl they're saying that he left one of the
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:25.560]  first orders even in basic training that you take I'm prior military myself is
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.720]  the order is I will not quit my post until properly relieved if you do that
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.040]  you are a term that we have not seen thrown out there yet in the media which
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:41.000]  is a wall a wall is absent without leave that is a punishable offense under the
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  uniform code of military justice this is something that has not been brought up
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.560]  as well I think we need to watch both of what they do with both of these people
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.760]  slowly both of them have leaked some kind of information to the enemy or given
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:59.840]  information to the enemy and we did you see if there's any consistency on the
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:06.720]  how we deal with both of these heroes or traitors you know when you say that
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.120]  that's notan has leaked information to the enemy you know quite frankly I don't
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:15.680]  think it came as news to any European spy agency that the American spy agency
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.040]  was doing what they're doing I don't think it came as any news to any terrorists
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:25.000]  that the NSA was watching them I think the only people that were surprised were
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.160]  the American public who had no reason to suspect that their government was spying
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:34.640]  on them we reported it nobody believed us when we said it nobody paid any
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.880]  attention to the NSA whistleblowers like Benny and Drake and others it was
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.960]  ignored by the mainstream media they pretended that it didn't exist just as
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.680]  they did build a bird the same technique we saw the Chinese government use
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.600]  against Tiananmen Square ignore it pretend it's not there flush it down the
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.640]  memory hole fortunately I think the most important thing about Snowden is that
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:59.640]  this is now out and in the public and we understand who the real criminals are
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.640]  gentlemen in search of a million dollars smile that'll make them take notice I

[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.000]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show we've been taking calls and comments about
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.200]  the one-year anniversary of the Ed Snowden documents beginning to leak what
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.220]  do you think is going to happen what's your take on it is he a criminal did he
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:36.040]  betray state secrets or did he inform us of who the real criminals are did he get
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:41.180]  people to believe what Alex Jones and NSA whistleblowers have been telling
[01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:45.540]  people for more than 10 years in many cases Alex has been talking about it
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:48.860]  longer than the NSA whistleblowers have they blew the whistle back in the early
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:55.380]  2000s and about 10 years later Snowden produced the documents you know we had
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:01.420]  a report in the very first segment of this hour going over Microsoft and what
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:06.600]  Mark Andreessen had said basically cheering the NSA on and you know we had
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.180]  information back in December that was leaked another one of the Snowden
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:15.500]  documents essentially showing apples involvement in this and there were a
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:20.940]  series of slides that I found to be very disturbing in both their cynicism and
[01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:26.260]  their mockery of the American public it was a series of three slides and if you
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:30.780]  all remember the Mac was introduced in 1984 with that award-winning commercial
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:35.020]  it was shot by Ridley Scott it aired on the Super Bowl just once it's been
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:40.300]  seen many many times about the runner who runs up with the the hammer and throws
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:46.920]  it into the Big Brother screen explodes it and they they showed that a single
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.380]  shot of that commercial and they said who would have thought that in 1984 then
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:56.460]  you get the next slide and it says that this and they show the iPhone would
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:01.620]  become Big Brother and then they show people lined up outside the Apple
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:08.420]  stores in order to get an iPhone which is nothing but a surveillance device for
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:13.740]  the NSA now that's the way the police state rolls out that's the way the
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:20.780]  technological technocratic takeover of our society rolls out it rolls out with
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:25.780]  one hand to help you and another one in your back pocket another one spying on
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:30.140]  your most personal aspects that's what we're seeing happening now they pointed
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:35.980]  out that of course there was a piece of software dropout Jeep it was it's very
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.740]  well known the NSA uses that and the Wall Street Journal said Apple says it
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:44.940]  never worked with NSA to create a backdoor in the products and yet either
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:49.300]  Apple is very technically incompetent or they were working with him and that's
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.860]  the same thing you can say about all of these different companies because of
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:58.020]  course it's kind of a probably like a mobster type of thing this way these
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:01.260]  guys work they come in and say well you can either be a part of us or we'll
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.220]  promote you we'll give you government contracts we'll give you access or we'll
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.620]  basically find some way to shut you down with some kind of a white glove
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:13.540]  inspection that's the way they can shake these corporations down they do it
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:16.460]  with small businesses they do with individuals and of course they can do
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:20.180]  it with the biggest of the companies I think it's interesting that Apple did
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:25.940]  not join the prism program until after Steve Jobs was gone so I don't think
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:30.140]  that he was all that amenable to it but I think that the the people who've been
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:34.900]  left behind who are centrally managers not visionaries like Steve Jobs don't
[01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:40.260]  really see that it's their lives that are on the line and not just ours
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:45.620]  because you know if they turn this over into a police state they're the ones who
[01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:50.780]  are going to be under the microscope as well it's always the people who are the
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:55.820]  leaders of a country just as we saw in the coup in Thailand we always see that
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.700]  it's the legislators the people who were in power that are the greatest threat to
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:03.340]  these people they're the ones who were lined up and taken away first so that's
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:07.340]  something for them to keep in mind and just a couple of minutes so we got left
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:11.060]  let's go quickly to Jason in Colorado Jason had a comment about the Ed Snowden
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:18.900]  documents yes sir go ahead I just here to say that I actually think what he did
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:24.340]  was a good thing as long as he's done another the right reasoning and I'm
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:28.060]  pretty sure the government's going to make it twist into something that is not
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:32.140]  and on another thing that you were talking about as far as the
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:38.860]  Internet's concerned how is the best way to find out what sites and stuff you
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:43.340]  can actually still go to that isn't under government control or spying on us I
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:47.260]  know yours isn't and I love your site I've only been here for like a month
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:51.060]  watching you guys and I've done everything I can to help out with this
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:54.860]  system because I actually use what you guys are doing well thank you you know
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:58.500]  they're spying on everybody on the Internet and that's something people
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.700]  need to be aware of that's what this reset the net campaign is about if you're
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:06.860]  a developer what can you do to give people tools that are going to if not
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:10.740]  totally block this because we had William Binion of course he was the global
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.260]  technical director he said there is anything you can do to stop it but if
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:18.420]  everybody is doing that that's the point in the reset the net campaign if
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.500]  everybody is resisting them that's a very effective strategy just as we see if
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:28.220]  if one person stands up and opposes the government in a protest they're going to
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:31.500]  slam you down we've seen that even in open carry rallies when you got a
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.980]  thousand people with guns slung over their shoulder they leave everybody
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:38.820]  alone everybody leaves and you've got just one person left they get hassled we
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:44.140]  stand together collectively for our individual rights the words to stand
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:47.220]  together or we're going to hang separately as Benjamin Franklin plays
[01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:51.380]  always been that way we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the
[01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:57.540]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:04.220]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:09.420]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:13.540]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:18.180]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:23.620]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:29.300]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:33.580]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:39.740]  iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent iodine was the

[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.660]  your host today we've been talking about the one-year anniversary of the
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:41.100]  Snowden documents the beginning of the leaks what do you think of it what do
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:44.220]  you think of what the effect is going to be of that and of course we're also
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:49.460]  talking about the release the prisoner exchange that Obama did where he
[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:54.060]  illegally released five get-mode detainees without following the 30-day
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:59.300]  procedure that's a very very clear violation of the law are we going to
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.700]  just say do that one more time and I'm gonna get seriously serious about
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:07.740]  enforcing the law I'm gonna maybe impeach you as Ms. Lindsey Graham said or we
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:12.020]  going to really see our politicians do something are they just going to score
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:16.420]  some cheap partisan points for the election or are they going to stand for
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:21.980]  the rule of law finally as George will pointed out it was Nixon who said on the
[01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:26.020]  David Frost show when the president does it that means it's not illegal well
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:29.300]  you know that's what we're seeing all the time from Obama whether it's so
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:36.140]  Obamacare just being amended at will by our commander our dictator in chief or
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:41.420]  whether he's killing American citizens abroad assassinating them with drones
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:46.300]  with secret orders that's what we see happening so we're taking your calls
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.820]  on that but I want to tell you first that this half hour of the Alex Jones show
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:55.180]  is brought to you by one of our new products survival shield x2 it's much
[01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:59.180]  stronger than regular survival shield through a unique manufacturing process
[01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:03.900]  that utilizes iodine sources from deep within the earth and tomorrow we're
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:07.420]  going to bring you some pictures of what those look like it's pretty amazing
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:12.380]  it's a unique new process that uses a high purity grade of iodine from more
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:18.580]  than 7,000 feet below the earth's surface below the radiation Fukushima wave is
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.460]  extracted from an ancient salt solution that yields a powerful and
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:27.900]  uncontaminated 650 micrograms of iodine per single drop it's tested with
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:32.420]  radiation readings at the labs to ensure freedom from Fukushima radiation
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:38.300]  developed by proprietary technology to create nascent iodine by using our key
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:43.100]  thermodynamic pressure sensitive high-energy sound pulse nano emulsion
[01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:47.780]  technology and we're going to be at the factory tomorrow to give you a shot of
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:52.460]  what that mouthful looks like we should come up with some kind of an acronym for
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:56.260]  that you know just like when they were killing the premature babies they
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.900]  called it support you know but actually this is something that you need to see
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:04.420]  this is a great source of a vital nutrient that you need you can get it at
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:12.260]  info wars store.com the toll-free number for that is 888-253-3139 again
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:20.260]  that's 888-253-3139 that's survival shield x2 our new product here now one
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:23.900]  of the other things that we hope that you'll support us with is prison planet
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:31.020]  TV we have the nightly news there we have all of Alex's documentaries going
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.260]  back are available for you to see as well as up to 10 people that you share
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:40.820]  your password with if you wish to help wake them up now every night we have
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:44.940]  great news and special reports from our people and as one of the callers earlier
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:50.980]  mentioned there was a connection between the release of Bergdahl and Michael
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:56.020]  Hastings and of course our own staff sergeant Joe Biggs who now works on the
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:37:01.300]  nightly news was in the platoon that Michael Hastings was embedded with he
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:05.260]  was a commander of that platoon at the staff sergeant level and got to know him
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:11.140]  very well so he knows a great deal about this Bergdahl situation here we got a
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:16.100]  report that he filed last night I want you to get his analysis of the comments
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:24.780]  and the video as they had this prisoner exchange here's that report and welcome
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.620]  to the Obama distraction I'm sorry to interrupt your coverage of the VA
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:33.060]  scandal but people are starting to get tired of watching the Malaysian flight
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.860]  investigation so the president's feelings are starting to get a little bit
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:40.380]  hurt due to the fact that his government-run health care plans not
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:45.260]  working out too good so without further ado I bring to you the Obama
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:50.660]  distraction Bo Bergdahl Bergdahl claimed he was nabbed when he fell behind on
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:56.300]  control but his fellow soldiers say he simply walked off post the military
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:00.180]  devoted weeks to searching for him and now some in his battalion are claiming
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:05.260]  that at least six soldiers were killed during those missions all right we're
[01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:09.620]  gonna break down the video of the Bo Bergdahl release from the Taliban to
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:14.300]  American soldiers as you can see Boston in the back of the Taliban vehicle this
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:19.040]  point the Taliban guys telling him to not come back to Afghanistan and I don't
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.260]  think he really means just him overall I think he means it's a message to America
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:29.820]  stay out we don't want you here here we are helicopter coming in Taliban guys
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:34.340]  RPGs on the mountain but just remember to though the government was saying when
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:37.780]  they found Bergdahl he was in a very weakened state looks to me he's standing
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.820]  up on his own and he is walking away just fine
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:45.260]  notice that pat on the back from this off right here making sure he doesn't have
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:50.140]  a vest on or anything like that already he's walking up to the helicopter with
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:53.660]  these guys notice and none of these guys are armed the Taliban had the white
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:58.980]  flag up Bo Bergdahl once again gets padded down check make sure he's got no
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:02.780]  weapons with or anything that's threatening and they're gonna put him
[01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:07.340]  in the helicopter and fly off he was looking for someone who spoke English
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:11.940]  so he could talk to the Taliban and when we heard that it told us okay he's
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:16.020]  actively seeking out the Taliban over the next couple months all the attacks
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:21.700]  definitely were far more directed following his disappearance ID started
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:25.020]  going off directly under the trucks they're getting perfect hits every time
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:30.500]  their ambushes were very calculated very methodical like they knew what we were
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:34.940]  gonna do what you just heard Bo Bergdahl's former team leader says in fact
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:40.780]  true if you go to the WikiLeaks.org Afghan war files you can actually read
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:45.820]  everything that happened that day where they actually say that they found him
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:50.940]  actively seeking the Taliban they heard chatter and the Kuchi tribe picked him up
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:57.740]  asking for Taliban who spoke English I mean it's all right there this is a big
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:02.380]  distraction from the VA but it is a story worth covering all right so if
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:07.300]  you're tired of the mainstream media mass distraction make sure you tune in to
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:12.340]  info wars and also go to prismplanet.tv and don't forget your username and
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:16.260]  password can be saved with up to ten report from Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs
[01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:20.340]  and of course he was in Afghanistan as well as Iraq and he knew Michael Hastings
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.980]  very well he'd been talking about Bergdahl before this ever happened and
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.460]  of course Chicago is putting out the story now that they had to get him
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.780]  because he was in a weakened state or Obama said we saw an opportunity and we
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:36.340]  seized it that's why we didn't follow the law it was an emergency I don't make
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:40.860]  any apologies for that so I don't buy that I don't know if you do we've got
[01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:46.220]  Michael in FEMA region number nine you want to talk about this Michael hey
[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:52.780]  what's up man let me get you off speaker okay yeah please do hey hey I've got
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:56.940]  notes taken down Snowden what is let me ask you a question what's the metal
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:02.260]  that's the equivalent of the CMH that they give the civilians well I don't
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:06.820]  know I've never been given a medal by my government I don't know what I believe
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:11.740]  they should do is they should Obama should pin that metal on Snowden's chest
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:18.220]  and then they should hang Bergdahl because it's the active high trees and
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:23.580]  during a time of war what they call war and then impeach on Obama that's right
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:28.180]  it is a striking contrast isn't it that they would have so many soldiers killed
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:33.180]  for searching for a deserter and then at the same time we have someone reveal
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:37.620]  criminal actions of our government that they would come after him and say they
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:40.780]  want to put him in jail they want to execute him there's been a lot of calls
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:46.460]  even to execute Glenn Greenwald we've seen over and over again on television
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:51.740]  it's like hey this journalist and we've seen Obama prosecute more people under
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:56.140]  the 1917 espionage act than all the other presidents combined all the other
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:02.060]  presidents before Obama only invoked that act four times in Obama in just five
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:06.260]  years has done it seven times against Pulitzer prize-winning journalists I
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:10.620]  mean he is trying to shut down the press and the public's right to know about
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:15.380]  anything but it is a striking contrast isn't it the way they have treated this
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:20.460]  deserter versus somebody who warned us about our government's illegal actions
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:26.700]  I agree with you 100% David try to do have one of your guys look up what the
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:31.700]  name of that metal is that they give to high-end civilians it's just like the
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:35.820]  Congressional Medal of Honor but that's what Snowden should receive and one
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:38.860]  other thing I want to say and I want to say it loud and clear and I've said it
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:43.580]  before on Alex Jones show is that I've had friends say you shouldn't say this
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:48.020]  online you shouldn't say this on your Facebook you shouldn't say this on on
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:53.580]  your cell phone I hope they're listening to me that's what I got to say my name
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:58.180]  is Michael in the region nine thank you for your time David night well Michael
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.940]  you're gonna have to watch out for that list when they when Greenwald eventually
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:04.940]  releases it see if your name is on the list of people they've been watching
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:09.300]  of course they've been watching everybody but some people they take special
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:13.580]  interest in here because it's political dissidents that they don't like it's
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:17.220]  tea party members that they don't like it's conservatives and libertarians and
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:20.860]  Ron Paul supporters and Chuck Baldwin supporters that they don't like and
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:26.500]  they've made that very clear and they are training to take over towns under
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:31.660]  martial law we see it in their scenarios we see it in their cities as I walk
[01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:36.260]  through with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs there in the asymmetric warfare center
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:41.140]  in Virginia and as part of that leading up to that went back and looked at their
[01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:44.620]  own videos at their conferences where they were talking about this I found it
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:49.700]  very interesting that these people who were talking about the history of
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:53.260]  asymmetric warfare what was working for them what was not in and by the way
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:58.020]  they've never won an asymmetric war and they admitted that but they also said
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:05.500]  the legitimacy of a government can be measured by how much security forces they
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:10.420]  need to use in order to maintain stability so I would say that by that
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:15.260]  yardstick I would say that our own government believes that it is not
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:20.060]  acting legitimately because they are ramping up the security state in this
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:24.540]  country like nobody can imagine let's go to another caller Peter in
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.740]  Pennsylvania you want to talk about propaganda
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:33.260]  go ahead Peter David night I got met I like Alex a little better on their on
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:37.180]  air because he's a little bit more of a shaman than you but you do a great job
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:42.060]  anyways thank you anyways but you were very courageous with the clout of
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:49.220]  Bundy and you know they were expated on like they usually do yeah so those
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:53.340]  that's a standard operating procedure reason I'm calling is did you happen to
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:59.660]  catch the between two ferns episode between Obama and Zach Alfinakis yeah
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.260]  yeah I saw a little bit of that I couldn't really watch too much of it I
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:08.860]  didn't want to making me sick I didn't well what you think about that well I
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:14.140]  have a master's degree in psychology and I study history in my spare time in
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:22.380]  particular propaganda gerbils other Soviet propaganda and Obama and
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:27.780]  Galfinakis made gerbils look like a like an elementary student compared to a
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:36.060]  guy with a PhD on this video so basically I'm writing a script for
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:41.260]  counter propaganda you know let me ask you what we're talking about propaganda
[01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:46.580]  it was just within this last year I believe that the government has said
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.900]  that they're going to use Radio Free Europe and Voice of America they had
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:55.940]  always used those strictly in foreign countries and communist countries and it
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.740]  was overt propaganda now they say they're going to use those organizations
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:07.860]  here domestically in the United States how do you feel about that yeah they
[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:11.780]  remove the act you know that was that was forbidden when they created them right
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:15.100]  after right the height of the Cold War right after World War two they created
[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:19.940]  those two agencies and they expressly forbade them to do anything in the
[01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:23.620]  United States just as we had after the church committee hearings the
[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:28.820]  intelligence community was forbidden to spy on Americans it was supposed to be
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.820]  only for foreigners that they're going to spy on but but now we see that they're
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:37.580]  they're using their spy machine here on Americans and drag net surveillance and
[01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:40.660]  now we see that they're going to broadcast propaganda to us just like
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:44.020]  they did in the Cold War because they know that they're losing the
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:49.100]  information war aren't they no they're not we have people like Alex Jones we
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.740]  have people like you get people like George that they're not going to beat us
[01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:58.340]  how do you find an idea like it was in ban her with another idea and I don't
[01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:01.380]  want to take much time but I'll tell you a little bit about the script without
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:06.860]  giving it away essentially you switch roles you have a fat softy looking guys
[01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:13.180]  president and a will real well reserved well-spoken instead of stupid looking
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:19.220]  guy interviewing him and rather than the president dodging the questions with
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:24.260]  humor you know he'd say stuff to that calphe neck it's like nobody cares about
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:29.140]  your text but he didn't answer the fact that it's illegal for him to read
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:35.140]  anybody's text messages or emails or phone conversations absolutely without
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:40.500]  being said it ended in the green room and a mom said what's going on where why
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:45.220]  are you on the set of my green room for my script it's gonna end in Guantanamo
[01:47:45.220 --> 01:47:54.380]  with this metaphor of a president being detained for breaking law I'm gonna
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:59.060]  even see you in two wars if Alex thinks it's a good idea you guys are more than
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:03.900]  welcome to shoot it well thanks appreciate that let's go to Joseph in
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:11.500]  Canada Joseph yes good day hey I'm talking about the best note and thing I
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:17.340]  guess it's a good thing that you know eventually he does try to come out and
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:25.500]  eventually try to expose these things but at the same time you know you still
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:32.780]  left with the you still left with the real rationalization that there's really
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:39.540]  nothing that's being done with the information I mean we have insurmountable
[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:46.220]  amounts of data that's that's proven that these people are abusing their
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:51.580]  positions they're they're acting incorrectly they're performing
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:57.380]  atrocities that are you know costing people's lives they're acts of treason
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:05.940]  they're murdering people and I think it really is going to take people that are
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:12.180]  in positions of power to wake up and say look you know we're not we're not gonna
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:17.380]  accept you know what you're gonna offer us you know for for you know some
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:21.100]  monetary gain for right now well that's exactly true you know the question is
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:25.740]  will we expose these things are we going to just sit there and watch it and say
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.060]  yeah that's right yeah I know that and nothing happens and so we just as a
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:34.300]  society become more cynical more passive just accept this and say well you know
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.020]  corruption and illegal activities that's just the way the government operates I
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:43.660]  hope that what's going to happen is eventually if you remember the iron
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:47.300]  curtain the in East Germany where they were shooting people going over the
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:53.660]  border in West Berlin from East Berlin to West Berlin one day the soldiers just
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:57.220]  decided that they won't weren't going to do that anymore one day the people got
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:00.220]  together they met at a church they marched up to the borders there were
[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:04.940]  the soldiers were guarding those walls and the soldiers just stood down because
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:09.620]  the people were sick and tired of it sometimes it takes a very long time for
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:13.340]  that to happen before the people who are implementing the policies for them
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:17.820]  essentially just make that ineffective now there's some other tools that we
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:21.060]  have still in America that we're not using as I mentioned several times
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:24.940]  already jury nullification there are things that we can do as individuals
[01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:30.100]  that are very potent very powerful ways to shut down this a little bit at a
[01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:34.220]  time we can protest we can do other things but the question is are we going
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:39.620]  to just become cynical and accepting of this or are we going to push back against
[01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:44.100]  this and of course we have I think a limited amount of time because what's
[01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:47.220]  going to happen is eventually they're not going to need those soldiers and
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:51.540]  police officers they're going to have multiplier force multipliers with
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:55.260]  robotics and with drones and that's when it gets really dangerous will we
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:58.900]  change before then we'll take your comments right after we come back we're
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:03.100]  also going to talk about Obama's whole failure Tisha Casada for Congress

[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:41.540]  about the law now we've got an article just went up on info wars dot com from
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:46.980]  Kurt Nemo impeach Obama over the Gitmo release how about the hypocrisy of
[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:51.060]  Senator Lindsey Graham and we're gonna be talking about that in the next break
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:55.660]  but I've got somebody hanging on the phone here to talk to us about banks and
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:55:00.140]  there was an interesting item in the news today European Central Bank is
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:04.300]  taking a radical step this is from the New York Times in an unprecedented
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:08.700]  attempt to stimulate the eurozone economy the European Central Bank said
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:12.620]  it will begin charging interest on deposits held by the bank you understand
[01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:17.300]  that they're going to charge interest on deposits not on loans but on deposits
[01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:21.740]  it's called a negative interest rate and this is something that is coming to us
[01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:26.900]  from guess who Super Mario that's Mario Draghi the guy who was the Goldman
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:31.300]  Sachs banker who was put in charge of Italy's economy deposing the duly
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:36.260]  elected person who was there he's now currently the European Central Bank
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:41.300]  president and they said that imposing a negative deposit rate is meant to give a
[01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:46.100]  positive jolt to the eurozone economy in the annals of central banking however
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:50.660]  negative deposit rates have rarely been tried yeah that's right let's see what
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:54.020]  happens but hey it's a sweetheart deal for the bankers isn't it if they can
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:58.340]  charge you to just deposit your money with them not to loan you money but to
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:01.980]  have your money be deposited with them and of course we have the story that's
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:07.340]  up on info wars today sorry from zero hedge financial reporter claims that
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:13.020]  debt is quote the bridge from working hard to playing hard this is a guy his
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:18.700]  name is Steve Leisman appropriately name he says debt is always pointed out as a
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:23.700]  negative thing when in fact debt is the great bridge between working hard and
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:28.940]  playing hard in this country this country has been built on consumer debt
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:34.780]  no this country is a house of cards on top of consumer debt that is about to
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:40.180]  fall down as well as nationally and of course that's a situation that has been
[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:45.500]  engineered by these central bankers the ones who are pumping and dumping the
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:50.620]  mortgage market pumping and dumping the euro who engineered as we pointed out
[01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:56.340]  59 years ago according to former chairman of Bilderberg the Bilderberg
[01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:01.500]  group they engineered the euro and the eurozone the European Union they did
[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:07.740]  that to take control of those countries to pump up the act the assets then to
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:13.420]  implode it like a kind of a panic in a bank situation we've seen happen with
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:17.260]  JP Morgan with the founding of the Federal Reserve they always pump it they
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:22.780]  dump it they buy it up at fire sale prices one more story about the bankers
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:27.500]  and we'll go to Minnesota polar bears comments Hillary Clinton's Goldman Sachs
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:32.340]  problems this is from Mother Jones they point out the hypocrisy of Hillary
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:39.960]  Clinton complaining about the wealth concentration of the top 0.01% she says
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:42.540]  that's risen sharply over the last generation it's a throwback to the
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:47.580]  gilded age of robber barons but they say is this Hillary test driving a theme
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:50.980]  for a possible 2016 presidential campaign sticking up for the little guy
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:56.620]  trashing the economic elites she talked about the shadow banking system that
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:58:02.980]  operated without accountability and yet all three Clintons were having a day-long
[01:58:02.980 --> 01:58:08.020]  confab with donors to their foundation and guess where they were meeting at the
[01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:14.180]  Manhattan headquarters of Goldman Sachs how's that for hypocrisy she's gotten
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:17.580]  between their foundations got between a quarter and a half million dollars from
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:21.980]  them just recently from just Goldman Sachs so she's running she's gonna use
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:26.940]  some populist rhetoric just as Obama used rhetoric about being transparent but
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:31.380]  we'll see what really happens if she becomes president let's hope that that
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:34.660]  doesn't happen we're gonna be right back after the break we're gonna take
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:39.060]  calls and we're gonna talk about Obama's EPA coal plant regulations day
[01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:55.180]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network the globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding making the
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:59.340]  weaponization even more vicious and deceptive all the major networks are
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:04.020]  state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has become a
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:08.580]  political weapon against the Second Amendment pushes Obamacare MSNBC tells
[01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:11.820]  us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our kind of
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:15.900]  private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:19.140]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more important than
[01:59:19.140 --> 01:59:23.940]  ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the true media
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:28.620]  the establishment dinosaur press is dying we are in an information war and

[01:59:50.020 --> 02:00:06.460]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network big brother
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:13.820]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:23.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:26.740]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and we were talking just
[02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:31.660]  before the top of the hour about Hillary Clinton's Goldman Sachs problems and
[02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:37.700]  of course how the bankers engineer the economic disasters of the euro of the
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:41.420]  mortgage collapse here in the United States and how Hillary Clinton is
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:46.580]  complaining about these economic elites and sounding very populist at the same
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:52.780]  time all three Clintons are meeting at the Goldman Sachs headquarters in
[02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:57.900]  Manhattan mother Jones pointed out that great hypocrisy and the fact that they
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:01.220]  have been receiving between a quarter and a half million dollars to their
[02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:05.940]  Clinton Foundation and they ask can the former Secretary of State cultivate
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:10.500]  populist credentials while hobnobbing with Goldman Sachs and pocketing money
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:14.620]  from it and other Wall Street firms well of course you can because the media is
[02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:19.500]  going to cover for her that's why it is so important for us to have a free press
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:24.660]  and one of the things that we can learn I think from the Snowden documents is
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:30.980]  that for the longest time we had the NSA whistleblowers as well as everything
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:36.700]  that we were saying opposed by the mainstream media finally one paper the
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:41.100]  Guardian takes these documents and people started to pay attention to it
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:44.780]  that's great we're happy to see that happen we'll take it let's hope that
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:48.540]  something happens in a positive way with that information that people don't
[02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:53.660]  just become cynical and passive but I wanted to get comments on bankers

[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:32.940]  something that would make a fine guess that would be able to explain it for
[02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:37.700]  every American citizen to understand the magnitude of this we all can get
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:42.580]  together his name is John Morris his website if you mind don't mind me giving

[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:54.820]  will be here or being heard will be the largest one on a planet so if they know

[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:16.220]  life observers so where we can all everybody we can all get together and do
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:23.460]  this to take our country back once very third chapter 11 goes through why do you
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:28.380]  think that you're training for the takeover of towns because once every
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:32.900]  third court goes for their chapter 11 goes through this puts out a can goose
[02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:39.900]  the event all across the United States taking away all our property rights this
[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:44.100]  is one of the founding things that this right here country was was built on oh
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:46.740]  without a doubt that's what they're without a doubt that's what they're
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:50.260]  training for there they're looking for an economic collapse one that I believe
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:54.620]  that they're engineering but that is fundamentally what is at the bottom of
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:58.380]  this is that they want to own everything they want this kind of feudalistic
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:01.820]  society where there's no middle class where everything is owned by the banks
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:05.660]  we've seen this happening for a long time the international monetary fund
[02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:10.460]  under Robert McNamara everybody can criticize them for what they called rent
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:15.100]  seeking they would go into third world countries they would extend massive
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:19.340]  amounts of loans to them not even for things like infrastructure but just
[02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:24.020]  things for like social welfare programs things that were essentially
[02:04:24.020 --> 02:04:28.980]  consumer items they weren't building any kind of income production and so they
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:33.220]  they gave them these loans they gave them massive interest rates and massive
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:37.260]  amounts of loans bankrupted those countries and then went in and seized
[02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:42.100]  assets that has been their game plan it's always been their game plan that's
[02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:45.300]  essentially the way they created the Federal Reserve I believe that's exactly
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:49.060]  what they're doing and they are training our soldiers they're training our
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:53.820]  police for martial law we've seen it any number of ways and that's what they're
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:56.940]  going to do they're going to take title of this stuff they're going to do it by
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:00.740]  force if necessary we'll be right back taking your calls a chemical spill

[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:51.940]  domestic terrorists that's what Cobra would say that's what specter would say
[02:10:51.940 --> 02:11:13.620]  that's what Goldfinger would say because that's who those people are resistance
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:21.660]  to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones thank you for joining us mr.
[02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:33.900]  Cobra leader welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and that's
[02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:39.220]  appropriate clip to run today when we see what Obama is doing with Bergdahl
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:44.060]  and the Taliban it's not just there you know it with that we have people like
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:47.660]  Jonathan Turley saying that Obama is the president that Richard Nixon always
[02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:53.300]  wished he could be we've got George will on the right saying that recalling that
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:57.580]  Nixon said when the president does it that means that it's not illegal doesn't
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:05.100]  sound exactly like Obama now there's also many other places where he does what
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:10.180]  he wishes where he changes Obamacare or where he shuts down coal plants he said
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:14.860]  when he was running for election the first time he said yeah you know you
[02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:18.820]  can open a coal plant but it's going to bankrupt you why because he's going to
[02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:23.740]  buy fiat shut down our energy sources and this is a story from the new American
[02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:29.380]  Obama's EPA coal plant regulations are quote Obamacare for the atmosphere now
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:33.900]  that's not the new Americans saying that that's actually somebody who's an Obama
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:39.940]  supporter see they cheer him on and these dictatorial pronouncements that he
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:45.820]  has this is a Jason that's a quote from Jason Marx the Daily Beast he said you
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:51.140]  can think of the power plant rules as Obamacare for the atmosphere numbingly
[02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:55.540]  complex in an effort to ensure flexibility and fairness based on a
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:13:00.420]  market system likely to transform a key sector of the economy for decades to
[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:05.260]  come I mean does that sound like an endorsement I mean this guy likes it he
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:10.100]  says it's numbingly complex of course it's going to be flexible and fair I don't
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:17.700]  really know how it's fair to increase our power bills by 100% or 200% I don't
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:21.180]  know how flexible they are on these rules I think they're pretty inflexible
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:25.620]  based on a market system there's no market system here and likely to
[02:13:25.620 --> 02:13:29.020]  transform a key sector of the economy for decades to come yeah I would say
[02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:34.180]  that's true you know I want to go back and look at one of the earliest nightly
[02:13:34.180 --> 02:13:40.700]  news reports that we had from Alex Jones this goes back to August of 2011 and he
[02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:44.540]  was talking about Obama's energy policies then let's see how much has
[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:49.780]  changed Obama hit struggling Americans with energy rate hikes following
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:55.060]  Barack Obama's vow to bankrupt the cold power industry Americans are set to be
[02:13:55.060 --> 02:14:01.980]  hit with a wave of utility bill hikes as draconian EPA regulations drive up the
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:06.260]  cost of energy so if somebody wants to build a coal power plant they can it's
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:11.460]  just that it will bankrupt them because they're gonna be charged a huge sum for
[02:14:11.460 --> 02:14:16.140]  all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted the Obama administration's
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:21.660]  crusade against coal-fired power plants which was launched on the back of
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:27.060]  discredited junk science about hyped global warming threats has little to do
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:30.620]  with improving the environment and everything to do with lowering living
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:36.700]  standards by creating artificial scarcity the EPA has now listed as harmful
[02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:42.660]  carbon dioxide that is part of the life cycle of the planet new EPA rules
[02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:48.180]  dictate that utility companies will be forced to spend an initial outlay of
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:53.700]  $800 million to conform with regulations that mandate harmful emissions be
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:58.460]  reduced under the Clean Air Act and yet power plants supplied by General
[02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:03.560]  Electric one of Barack Obama's biggest campaign contributors have received an
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:09.080]  EPA waiver and will not be subject to the new regulations the new rules will
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:14.420]  exacerbate the problem of rolling blackouts warns Donna Nelson head of
[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:19.460]  the Texas Public Utility Commission Nelson said quote I have no doubt in my
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:24.900]  mind that this rule will result in reliability issues and rolling outages
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:30.860]  in Texas Obama's strict enforcement of draconian EPA regulations has led to
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:35.220]  new clean-burning coal-fired plants being mothballed and other existing ones
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:40.140]  being shut down which has in turn led to Texas and other states becoming energy
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:45.380]  dependent all of this of course will lead to significantly higher utility
[02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:50.700]  bills for US citizens who are being assaulted with more and more expenses
[02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:57.260]  even as the threat of a double-dip recession lowers living standards there
[02:15:57.260 --> 02:16:01.780]  you go that's a report from three years ago and that much has changed has it we
[02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:07.740]  still see Obama's war on coal-fired plants we also see that just as he did
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:12.460]  it's an apt analogy isn't it when the Daily Beast says it's Obamacare for the
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:16.500]  atmosphere because just as Alex Jones reported three years ago he was giving
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:21.220]  his corporate buddies his crony capitalist friends waivers from these
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:26.260]  regulations just as he gave people that he wanted the corporations that he
[02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:30.340]  liked he gave them waivers from Obamacare arbitrarily moving the
[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:34.740]  deadlines around to make sure that the voters didn't make the connections
[02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:38.980]  before the elections but after the elections now in this story from the
[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:43.820]  new American written by William Jasper they point out again this let me read
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:46.580]  this quote one more time to you this is from the Daily Beast they said it's
[02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:52.580]  Obamacare for the atmosphere numbingly complex but still flexible and fair
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:56.820]  based on a market system and likely to transform a key sector of the economy
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:17:01.460]  for decades to come exactly you know what there is nothing that affects not
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:05.100]  only your prosperity but your standard of living and even the length of your
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:11.300]  life than cheap available energy now as he points out in this article in the
[02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:14.460]  new American he says is it based on a market system this is what he says
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:18.780]  perhaps a fascist corporate state market system in which politically
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:23.620]  connected companies reap huge cap and trade profits certainly not a free market
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:28.300]  system for the longest time the globalist have been looking to replace
[02:17:28.300 --> 02:17:33.340]  their central banking fiat currency schemes their national debt schemes
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:37.820]  they've been looking to replace that with some kind of an energy scheme some
[02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:42.060]  way where we have to pay them not for the privilege of having money in
[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:46.300]  circulation you know we pay debt to our privately owned Federal Reserve system
[02:17:46.300 --> 02:17:52.300]  which cannot even be audited by our own elected representatives they're immune
[02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:55.980]  from even having the books open we've been paying them for the privilege of
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:18:01.820]  printing money now we're going to pay another private cartel global cartel
[02:18:01.820 --> 02:18:07.140]  we're going to now pay them an indulgence to be able to use energy they
[02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:12.620]  call it a global carbon tax you know even the people who believe that we have
[02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:17.860]  global warming I'm a skeptic of that we see that the data does not prove that we
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:22.620]  see that their models say that as CO2 was was to rise that we would have a
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:26.660]  commensurate rise and global temperatures that hasn't happened we've
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:32.180]  seen the CO2 rise we've seen that the temperatures have not risen and so their
[02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:36.580]  model is broken but even those people many environmentalists who believe that
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:41.860]  there is man-made global warming and that it is due to carbon dioxide even
[02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:47.340]  those people don't see as any kind of a solution sending all of your money to
[02:18:47.340 --> 02:18:52.140]  Al Gore anytime you use a little bit of energy that's not a solution that's
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:58.100]  feudalism it's not environmentalism it's feudalism on steroids it's worse than
[02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:02.780]  the central banks you know they're trying to support this even the EPA has
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:06.980]  become well even the EPA of course the EPA the EPA has become the biggest cheer
[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:10.740]  leader for this says learn about carbon pollution from power plants they have a
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:13.660]  page on their website where they're talking about rising global temperatures
[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:18.740]  isn't happening rising sea level isn't happening changes and weather and
[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:23.620]  precipitation patterns that isn't really happening either changes in ecosystems
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:28.700]  habitats and species diversity look weather is always in a state of flux it
[02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:32.740]  is always changing but if you look at the long-term trends it doesn't support
[02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:38.700]  their data even Canada is cracking down and telling the weathermen not to talk
[02:19:38.700 --> 02:19:42.180]  about climate change we saw this at the American Meteorological Association in
[02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:46.900]  Austin last year we saw the weathermen were actually doing real science they
[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:49.860]  had real models they were trying to protect predict things a couple of days
[02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:54.420]  in advance but the climate scientists predicting things out decades away
[02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:58.940]  centuries away their models can't be tested they're baloney we're gonna be

[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:14.620]  because there's a war on for your mind
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:18.180]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm just looking at the
[02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:23.020]  Drudge Report and he's got an article up here a poll says that Obama is less
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:26.100]  competent than Bush that's what the American people think well that's
[02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:30.620]  getting down there isn't it that's that's getting really low where is that on the
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:34.460]  Jimmy Carter scale I don't know but it's it's getting really bad we've been
[02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:37.780]  taking your calls on the one-year anniversary of the Snowden documents
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:44.060]  what do you think that means is he a traitor or is he a hero and how are we
[02:24:44.060 --> 02:24:49.740]  going to rein our government and to obey the law because in my opinion I think
[02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:54.700]  what he did was he exposed like many whistleblowers frequently take a wrap
[02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:59.740]  for he explodes exposed criminal actions by our government he didn't give away
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:03.940]  any secrets that other spy agencies didn't already know about that Harris
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:08.860]  didn't know about what he did was he showed the American people that they
[02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:15.340]  are the targets of their own government he's exposed a secret shadow
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:18.580]  government that is operating outside of the law
[02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:23.460]  unaccountable to the law and we see that being done openly by Obama let's take
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:27.180]  some of your comments Michael in Oregon Michael
[02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:35.220]  hey David I get two things to say one I think you are a great host I mean Alex is Alex and you are you and you do a great job and I
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:38.820]  I think you do awesome so I want to say that and secondly I just wanted to give
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:43.100]  you guys a follow-up last week I did call Greg Walden and Ron Wyden my two
[02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:46.900]  senators in Oregon told them you know I'm complaining about Bill de Berg in the
[02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:51.900]  Logan Act and you guys have a duty to do something about it and and their
[02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:58.420]  flunky people just that well I'll pass on the message Ed Blumenauer at his office
[02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:02.740]  actually told me this and I'm quoting the government can do whatever we want
[02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:07.220]  to do close quote and then hung up on and I really need to represent it and I
[02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:11.900]  find that very disconcerting and you know you know it's crazy that they
[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:17.020]  don't care what we say well there you go and give everybody in Washington his
[02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:24.140]  name again there's Ed Blumenauer representative does not care and then
[02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:31.020]  there is well Greg Walden and Ron Wyden and they just don't care always I'll
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:34.260]  pass on the message it's like well I don't want I don't want you to pass on
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:38.060]  the message I want a response that's right they don't care that's right yeah
[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:41.380]  they won't respond to you but it is still important to call them up about that
[02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:45.220]  response that we're the government and we'll do whatever we want to isn't that
[02:26:45.220 --> 02:26:50.980]  the message that we've gotten over this over the Snowden leaks absolutely
[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:55.500]  unrepentant about any of their criminal actions being exposed like I mentioned
[02:26:55.500 --> 02:27:00.100]  before when we were broad when we were Copenhagen reporting on Bilderberg
[02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:05.740]  seeing this story out of the UK that some whistleblower had reported this
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:11.020]  atrocious treatment of children and seniors and yet the response was not to
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:16.420]  do anything not to correct that but to fire that guy I mean that's what we
[02:27:16.420 --> 02:27:20.620]  expect from them actually you know I again it's that quote that Richard Nixon
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:24.500]  said when the president does it that means it isn't illegal and that's what
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:28.060]  they're saying we're the government we can do whatever we wish that's that's
[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:32.220]  very sad thank you for letting us know that let's go to Stephen in Arizona you
[02:27:32.220 --> 02:27:35.300]  wanted to talk about the NSA
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:42.380]  oh I'm sorry okay he's no longer with us how about Darcy in Canada Darcy hello
[02:27:42.380 --> 02:27:47.620]  David yes did you hear me yes I sure can hi David I wanted to talk quickly
[02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:53.940]  about well with regard to the Snowden leaks if you know if they are or were
[02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:59.460]  orchestrated through government channels the chilling effect is real because I
[02:27:59.460 --> 02:28:03.580]  tell you even getting the nerve to call in the inforrs of an illicitor for both
[02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:08.300]  six years and you know I've wanted to call in it's it's difficult to get up
[02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:13.100]  that nerve and it's it's through knowing and reading these NSA documents that
[02:28:13.100 --> 02:28:19.380]  were leaked by Snowden that you know it actually accentuates that that
[02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:24.980]  nervousness that chilling effect so on that note I've got a couple things that
[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:28.300]  I want to mention I thought were important ways that we can keep our
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:34.900]  communications line of the lines open and it involves something called PSK 31
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:41.020]  and what it is is a digital mode over shortwave radio and you can actually
[02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:46.940]  send out reports that operate much like a chat room you can dial into a small
[02:28:46.940 --> 02:28:53.260]  area bandwidth between two and thirty megahertz on the shortwave band and and

[02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:38.260]  unpacked a little bit for the audience because that's what some of the people

[02:33:17.060 --> 02:33:21.860]  this transmission you are the resistance
[02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:29.540]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here as your host and I
[02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:33.900]  just had John Bowen come in and give me a message from Leanne McAdoo she told me
[02:33:33.900 --> 02:33:39.220]  that actually Snowden did give information to the enemy the enemy of
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:42.500]  course from the government's perspective is the American people so I stand
[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:47.180]  corrected I think that's absolutely true perfect now I've got on the phone and
[02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:50.460]  and hang on for just a little bit longer if you will Darcy from Canada he was
[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:55.300]  giving us some information about things that people could do things that you can
[02:33:55.300 --> 02:34:01.980]  do to maintain your privacy and I think we all need to do that as a as a way to
[02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:06.580]  just resist this illegal tyranny that's being put on us that we've been made
[02:34:06.580 --> 02:34:11.620]  aware of with the Ed Snowden leaks it's essentially become widespread knowledge
[02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:15.660]  now we were telling you about it for a very long time Alex was telling you that
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.380]  they're spying on you that they're watching you through your monitors that
[02:34:18.380 --> 02:34:21.980]  they're recording everything that you're saying that there and David Petraeus
[02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:26.940]  told us well before the leaks that they were going to use your appliances the
[02:34:26.940 --> 02:34:31.940]  what they call the Internet of Things they were going to use that to spy on
[02:34:31.940 --> 02:34:35.380]  you you know you think you've got automated house controls well that's
[02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:39.740]  one level that's the most obvious level that's what you're using it for they're
[02:34:39.740 --> 02:34:43.580]  using it for something completely different just like they use your iPhone
[02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:48.500]  just like they laugh at the American public that we queue up in lines in
[02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:54.540]  order to buy our 1984 devices they laughed about that and slides that were
[02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:59.260]  part of the Snowden leak so it's a lot of very valuable information why are we
[02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:04.100]  going to do with it we can't get the NSA to stop doing it we can't get our
[02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:09.180]  senators to do anything about it but there are some steps that we can take
[02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:15.140]  individually and I want to talk to Darcy from Canada about PSK 31 before we do I
[02:35:15.140 --> 02:35:21.860]  want to do a little bit of housekeeping here this half hour of the Alex Jones

[02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:39.780]  by artificial estrogen chemicals even more so than men and this hormone
[02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:45.060]  imbalance leads to weight gain as well as depression so it's a great product
[02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:48.660]  that you can use try that it helps to support our operation as well as
[02:35:48.660 --> 02:35:52.420]  survival shield x2 we're gonna have a very special report tomorrow we're
[02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:57.060]  going to show you these crystals these iodine crystals that are harvested at
[02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:02.060]  more than 7,000 feet below the earth below the Fukushima ground effects we
[02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:06.860]  test them for radiation we're going to show you those crystals as well as the
[02:36:06.860 --> 02:36:10.140]  factory there's going to be a tour of that tomorrow some of the information
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:12.340]  we're going to have on the show tomorrow don't miss it that's going to be
[02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:17.620]  fascinating but survival shield x2 available now at info wars store calm
[02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:21.100]  it's a way that you can support our operation here we're not funded by the
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:26.660]  government we're funded by offering you products that help you as well as help
[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:32.380]  us it's a win-win situation now I want to go back to Darcy in Canada Darcy you
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:36.620]  were telling us about PSK 31 you said it was a digital mode operating over
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:41.780]  shortwave explain that to us a little bit do you need a special hardware or is
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:48.140]  it besides your shortwave radio if you're if you're operating with with
[02:36:48.140 --> 02:36:53.780]  there's a few portable shortwave radio models that that work quite well with
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:37:00.700]  that like icon has one yes I think is another manufacturer but they there's a
[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:05.500]  rig blaster device it's a small hundred dollar unit that interfaces through USB
[02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:10.580]  to your sound card between the the radio and it'll actually do the phase shift
[02:37:10.580 --> 02:37:15.980]  keying for your handset it'll it'll allow you to operate in the digital mode
[02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:20.220]  basically you type in your what you want to send out and it does all the
[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:26.660]  translation almost like a teletype in a way and and actually beyond PSK 31
[02:37:26.660 --> 02:37:33.060]  there's other modes that like Q 15 X 25 and you can do a quick search on these
[02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:36.020]  on with right yeah we don't want to get too technical on it because people are
[02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:38.820]  listening on the radio but it's important for people to know that there
[02:37:38.820 --> 02:37:42.820]  are ways that they can get on the internet that circumvent these pipes and
[02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:45.500]  and that's something thank you Darcy and candidate that's something that's very
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:50.620]  important because we're seeing an all-out threat against the internet this
[02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:54.420]  month's infowars magazine talks about the death of the internet take it a
[02:37:54.420 --> 02:37:59.860]  picture of this guy's this magazine here death of the internet and that's our
[02:37:59.860 --> 02:38:04.580]  magazine this month Alex created the magazine as another way an alternative
[02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:08.020]  way to get information out there in case they do shut the internet down and of
[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:12.060]  course we've been talking all week about free speech we've been talking about
[02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:18.220]  how governments can effectively shut down any discussion of things like
[02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:20.940]  Bilderberg pretend that it doesn't exist just as the Chinese government
[02:38:20.940 --> 02:38:25.300]  pretended that the Tiananmen Square massacre didn't exist now 25 years later
[02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:29.180]  you've got a generation of people that have never even heard of it when they
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:35.340]  were shown a picture of the famous tank man they said is that a parade is that
[02:38:35.340 --> 02:38:40.660]  your artwork what what is that they had no idea what that was about so
[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:44.980]  governments and government control press and make no mistake about it we have
[02:38:44.980 --> 02:38:49.260]  that here in this country can very effectively shut down information to
[02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:53.060]  the public just by pretending that it doesn't exist just by ridiculing as a
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:56.620]  conspiracy theory any information that people might get out about something
[02:38:56.620 --> 02:39:01.020]  that they're not reporting on for years for decades we had television
[02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:06.580]  dominated by only three stations three networks major networks and they were
[02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:11.500]  essentially on the same page so if these guys didn't talk about it then and you
[02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:14.500]  heard some information from somebody else clearly that wasn't true because
[02:39:14.500 --> 02:39:19.260]  they were all reading off of the same script it was only when the fairness
[02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:23.580]  doctrine which hadn't been imposed by the FCC it was only when the fairness
[02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:29.180]  doctrine was taken away in the Reagan administration that we had the rise of
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:34.260]  talk radio and people heard a different voice they heard an independent voice
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:40.260]  then after that we had the rise of the internet and they got even more of that
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:44.540]  now they're trying to shut that down they're not only talking about shutting
[02:39:44.540 --> 02:39:49.940]  down the fairness doctrine but they're also working in many different ways to
[02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:53.340]  shut down the internet that's what this magazine is about the death of the
[02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:56.180]  internet the many ways that they can do that and the reason I had Darcy from
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:01.140]  Canada talk about the way that you can get digital signals over a shortwave
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:05.700]  radio and you can Google that yourself and see how to do that the reason I had
[02:40:05.700 --> 02:40:11.220]  him talk about that a little bit more in detail is because what we can see what
[02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:16.980]  what may happen with the FCC now is with the net neutrality regulations once
[02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:23.340]  they allow certain mega corporations to have much much faster internet than
[02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:27.780]  other people that's going to be tantamount to shutting down effectively
[02:40:27.780 --> 02:40:31.140]  shutting down these alternative media outlets it's going to make it difficult
[02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:35.660]  for us to compete it's going to make it impossible for many of you out there who
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:38.900]  are independent Paul reveres independent bloggers it's going to make it
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:42.700]  difficult if not impossible for you to get your information out there because
[02:40:42.700 --> 02:40:47.660]  people are going to get accustomed to high-speed internet who can stand going
[02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:53.500]  back to say let's say dial-up speed if you're accustomed to broadband you are
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:57.540]  not going to want to browse those sites that are incredibly slow they're going
[02:40:57.540 --> 02:41:00.700]  to look like they're frozen they're going to look like they're not working this is
[02:41:00.700 --> 02:41:06.740]  being driven by Comcast and Verizon and the people who are running the
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:10.700]  infrastructure of the internet they're the ones controlling the pipes they want
[02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:15.140]  this the people don't want it and in most cases the internet provider the
[02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:20.260]  content providers people like Google and others even oppose this there was an
[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:26.340]  interesting thing that happened yesterday there was a comedian John Oliver he
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:31.900]  went on a net neutrality rant he had about a 13-minute skit talking about
[02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:35.900]  net neutrality and he said the most dangerous thing is that the government
[02:41:35.900 --> 02:41:41.580]  can do the worst things to us and get away with it because they make it boring
[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:45.260]  and they make it technical and so what he did was he worked against that let's
[02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:47.740]  play a little bit of a clip of that we can't play too much because it's like
[02:41:47.740 --> 02:41:50.500]  13 minutes on but let's play a little bit of that right now to get people a
[02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:56.260]  sample of that is so egregious activists and corporations have been forced on
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:42:01.100]  to the same side that's basically Lex Luthor knocking on Superman's apartment
[02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:05.260]  door and going listen I know we have our differences but we have got to get rid
[02:42:05.260 --> 02:42:12.060]  of that asshole in apartment 3b exactly and that we have our disagreements we
[02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:16.500]  have I have disagreements with John Oliver on many issues but we need to all
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:22.500]  come together and we need to we need to push back against the police state we
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:27.180]  need to push back against the loss of free speech and they can take our free
[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:32.260]  speech any number of ways we've seen with Sopa Syspa Acta Pippa we had to
[02:42:32.260 --> 02:42:39.260]  defeat Syspa twice and now it's coming at us through these trade partnerships a
[02:42:39.260 --> 02:42:42.780]  trans-specific partnership the transatlantic partnership they're trying
[02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:47.980]  to bring these same control techniques into the back door so yes we we have very
[02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:52.300]  important differences on certain things but just like Superman and Lex Luthor we
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:57.420]  need to come together and we need to stop the police state we need to stop
[02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:01.740]  big brother the surveillance state we need to work together on this and we
[02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:06.460]  need to to me that's that's one of the most important things about the Snowden
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:12.180]  leaks and I think it's a real litmus test to see who the real people are the
[02:43:12.180 --> 02:43:16.220]  people that are controlled the people who want to control everything about our
[02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:20.500]  society the people who are really the authoritarians in society the people who
[02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:27.820]  want a militarized police and use the police in a in a militarized way to use
[02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:32.100]  the military as police we need to root out the people who are going to take
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:36.420]  away our court systems who are going to impose this kind of surveillance on us
[02:43:36.420 --> 02:43:41.900]  at the same time that they censor our free speech let's go to some of your
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:46.420]  calls and comments let's Cindy and FEMA region 3 you had something you want to
[02:43:46.420 --> 02:43:53.620]  say about the Bergdahl incident Cindy yeah hi David you're a good man you look
[02:43:53.620 --> 02:43:58.260]  back up one second the man who called in from Oregon he was saying about his
[02:43:58.260 --> 02:44:03.220]  representative yes we have the same thing over here senator Pat Toomey he was a
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:09.020]  tea party candidate and when he got in there he turned coach so fast I emailed
[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:14.060]  his office called his office and said they needed to get rid of the Patriot
[02:44:14.060 --> 02:44:18.700]  Act and he was like oh no we have to have the Patriot Act oh yeah you know and
[02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:24.860]  this is to me it just blew me away I just want to recall all of them yes and
[02:44:24.860 --> 02:44:30.100]  that's just this blade all guy and let me interject there too that's what I was
[02:44:30.100 --> 02:44:33.500]  just saying is that you know there there are some real differences between Pat
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:37.180]  Toomey and some of the Democrats but when we get to the point where we're going
[02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:41.620]  to allow the government unrestrained police powers we're going to lose our
[02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.180]  basic freedoms we're going to lose our due process where they're going to be
[02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:49.180]  able to do anything to us violate any law with immunity where everything is
[02:44:49.180 --> 02:44:53.220]  secret there is no transparency that's where the left and the right need to come
[02:44:53.220 --> 02:44:56.540]  together just like he's talking about joking about Superman and Lex Luthor
[02:44:56.540 --> 02:45:01.500]  coming together we need to make some common cause on these basic things shut
[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:05.420]  that down and then we can talk about some other very important issues but if we
[02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:10.900]  don't have the freedom of speech if we don't have privacy if we live under a
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:15.940]  police state then we're not going to have any of these other freedoms either
[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:22.500]  sorry go ahead I just oh that's okay they know that too is just playing one hand
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:26.860]  against the other Democrat against Republican whatever I see Democrats and
[02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:31.220]  Republicans is all the same oh yeah I think it's time for a third party really
[02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:35.660]  because they're all the same on those core issues they are the same did you have
[02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:42.220]  a comment about Bergdahl yeah I don't trust that guy and what Obama did when
[02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:46.340]  he said we don't leave any of our young men behind who's he kidding what about
[02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:51.100]  this Marine in Mexico I find him more important why don't we threaten Mexico
[02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:54.420]  instead of giving up five terrorists why don't we say well we're going to give
[02:45:54.420 --> 02:45:59.380]  you 30,000 of your felons back rapist murderers whatever we'll send them back
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:05.980]  to Mexico we want our Marine our real soldier yeah it's a it's amazing what's
[02:46:05.980 --> 02:46:09.580]  happened here and as as previous callers pointed out it's a real striking
[02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:13.660]  contrast to see the way they have talked about Snowden and the way they've
[02:46:13.660 --> 02:46:16.940]  talked about Bergdahl I think it's pretty telling thank you so much Cindy
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:22.020]  let's go to Jason in FEMA region 10 you want to talk about Snowden documents go
[02:46:22.020 --> 02:46:30.540]  ahead good afternoon David hey hey I I don't think Edward Snowden is a traitor
[02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:35.700]  but I don't necessarily think he's a hero either I feel that he should have
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:42.900]  stayed around in the US survey if you wanted to really if you really wanted
[02:46:42.900 --> 02:46:46.380]  to stand his ground and make a message here you know and be a martyr for a
[02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:51.620]  greater cause I just think he was kind of a coward for running away well you know
[02:46:51.620 --> 02:46:57.260]  we can all second guess what he did I mean I've even you know who knows I'm
[02:46:57.260 --> 02:47:02.100]  I'm grateful that the information has come out even if it was some people have
[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:06.340]  even criticized him is as deliberately putting that out as being a shill but I'm
[02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:12.500]  glad that it's out there I think people needed to see that it has woken people up
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:17.540]  in a way that frankly they they were not aware of before if they ever even heard
[02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:21.140]  that because the mainstream media was not talking about what the NSA was doing
[02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:26.380]  if they even heard the stories about the whistleblowers from the NSA like William
[02:47:26.380 --> 02:47:30.540]  Benny they would dismiss it as not important or they wouldn't really pay
[02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:34.740]  any attention to it so for whatever reason these documents have basically put
[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:38.260]  it front and center on people and now the question is what are we as the
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:40.820]  American people going to do about it I think that's really the question what
[02:47:40.820 --> 02:47:45.220]  do you think we should do about it absolutely I feel that we should have
[02:47:45.220 --> 02:47:48.820]  more whistleblowers come out and you know expose what's going on in this
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:53.340]  country because there's a lot of shadow business happening and it's really up to
[02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:57.500]  us as people to come together and no longer be the divided states of America
[02:47:57.500 --> 02:48:01.820]  and you know we've got to be united yeah you never know what these people are
[02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:06.180]  capable of doing and so you know even though he didn't stay in America and do
[02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:10.420]  it that doesn't mean that he wasn't aware that there was a great deal of risk
[02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:14.560]  to him I mean look at their reaches pretty strong look at they got Julian
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:21.620]  Assange he's holed up in an embassy in London and so you know that's that's
[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:26.420]  always a risky thing I'm glad that he exposed it and I just hope that we can
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:30.660]  do something with it let's go to Jake and Idaho Jake
[02:48:30.660 --> 02:48:39.180]  hey there can you hear me yes go ahead hey I just wanted to add on to what that
[02:48:39.180 --> 02:48:44.260]  gentleman was saying about the chapter 11 bankruptcy you had asked what it was
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:50.620]  and I feel like this issue is it's an issue that if their finding is going to
[02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:56.940]  affect you know 90% of finance properties and speaking of convoluted and
[02:48:56.940 --> 02:49:03.300]  and all that that you're talking about what it does is the your mortgage has
[02:49:03.300 --> 02:49:12.340]  been sold off many many times through companies that are hydras of the federal
[02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:19.860]  government Brandy May and Freddie Mac and when you think you've made your last
[02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:26.540]  payment and you actually hold your title your mortgage title is the chain of
[02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:35.620]  custody has been broken along the way and it will revert back to the back to
[02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:40.820]  those government agencies that you know they will in essence own your land and
[02:49:40.820 --> 02:49:44.340]  well they've created a real mess that's for sure I the way that I've heard it
[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:49.780]  explained is that you know when they started securitizing these these loans
[02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:55.420]  what they essentially did was kind of like putting all the mortgages into the
[02:49:55.420 --> 02:49:58.660]  mortgage documents into a blender and chopping them up and then pouring a
[02:49:58.660 --> 02:50:01.340]  little bit of it out over here and a little bit out of it of it out over
[02:50:01.340 --> 02:50:05.900]  there essentially destroying them and losing as you point out a chain of
[02:50:05.900 --> 02:50:11.300]  custody now there we had a guest on here at info wars he's gone out as a
[02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:16.860]  consultant to a lot of county governments because frankly the county
[02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:20.460]  governments get a lot of their revenue to support them from recording the
[02:50:20.460 --> 02:50:23.980]  mortgage deeds and always in the past what would happen is as a mortgage was
[02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:28.500]  sold it would be recorded locally they would pay the taxes for that there
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:35.460]  would be a very clearly documented chain of who owns what that's been taken away
[02:50:35.460 --> 02:50:40.100]  they've lost that revenue some of them are very angry about that and and trying
[02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:45.540]  to stop that so it's a real mess beyond that we have derivatives that are tens
[02:50:45.540 --> 02:50:49.620]  of trillions of dollars that are out there that these bankers want to put
[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:53.220]  sovereign governments on the hook to guarantee for them so they can then come
[02:50:53.220 --> 02:50:57.100]  back and claim that the governments have to bail them out that's the game the

[02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:10.660]  buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that
[02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:14.220]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy that
[02:53:14.220 --> 02:53:17.980]  social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you might
[02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:22.460]  even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that
[02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:26.380]  the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all
[02:53:26.380 --> 02:53:30.420]  looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold or the realists there
[02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:35.260]  have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold since 2001 the US

[02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:17.980]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight taking your calls this
[02:54:17.980 --> 02:54:22.540]  final segment we were talking earlier in the program about David Lutterman
[02:54:22.540 --> 02:54:27.420]  having CNN's Anderson Cooper on David Lutterman was demanding gun control
[02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:31.580]  attacking the Second Amendment get Daniels just put an article up
[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:37.220]  summarizing that has a great quote in here he says compare the panel at last
[02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:41.540]  year's South by Southwest he says compare that to grassroots open carry
[02:54:41.540 --> 02:54:45.820]  rally that also occurred during South by Southwest had over a hundred gun owners
[02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:51.100]  on a weekday and he pointed out that the panel that was set up by Bloomberg
[02:54:51.100 --> 02:54:56.820]  didn't attract more than just a handful of people probably less than I would say
[02:54:56.820 --> 02:54:59.940]  less than a dozen from the pictures that I saw you know kind of like David
[02:54:59.940 --> 02:55:03.380]  Lutterman's audience is what I would say it was a very very small number of
[02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:09.220]  people there's really not a constituency out there for blaming
[02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:14.420]  reasonable people for the irrational acts of one individual and as we've
[02:55:14.420 --> 02:55:21.100]  learned this week Elliot Rogers the guy who went around killing women posting a
[02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:24.500]  suicide note and attacking them of course you know he stabbed people as well as
[02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:28.300]  shooting them they're not calling for knife control but the real thing that
[02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:32.860]  needs to be controlled are these pharmaceutical drugs that are widely
[02:55:32.860 --> 02:55:36.340]  prescribed for people but of course nothing is being said about that because
[02:55:36.340 --> 02:55:40.420]  they sponsor programs like the David Lutterman program they are the major
[02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:45.460]  sponsors of most of the networks Bob in Texas said that he wanted to make a
[02:55:45.460 --> 02:55:49.300]  comment about the NSA in the second amendment Bob yes David how are you
[02:55:49.300 --> 02:55:54.260]  today doing good great listen yeah Alex was talking about second amendment the
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:59.380]  other day and all the gunkers all they're trying to get into place and David I'm
[02:55:59.380 --> 02:56:04.060]  someone that doesn't own a gun I've never owned a gun all my life see no real
[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:08.460]  reason to go and own one but always want to know that if I want to I want to go
[02:56:08.460 --> 02:56:13.460]  get one there are people that do not own guns that also benefit from the fact
[02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:16.860]  that guns are legal and available if they're legal and available in your
[02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:20.620]  area you keep criminals guessing they don't know whether you have a gun or
[02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:24.780]  not but if you are lawfully able to have a gun you very well could have one in
[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:29.300]  your house and that in itself is a deterrent yes that's absolutely true
[02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:34.620]  and we see that reflected in the statistics and I've had several interviews
[02:56:34.620 --> 02:56:41.060]  with the former a former prosecutor in Chicago's Cook County Jim Girok he's
[02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:45.380]  now with law enforcement against prohibition their website is leap dot
[02:56:45.380 --> 02:56:50.860]  cc former law enforcement officials former prosecutors who are against the
[02:56:50.860 --> 02:56:56.740]  war on drugs and as he's pointed out in Chicago he knows from decades as a
[02:56:56.740 --> 02:57:01.860]  prosecutor there that 80% of the shootings there in Chicago are a function
[02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:07.500]  of the failed war on drugs it isn't the fact that gun control that that gun
[02:57:07.500 --> 02:57:12.260]  ownership is allowed there they hassle gun owners they're like nowhere else and
[02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:16.660]  so the people who are armed are typically the drug dealers and as we see
[02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:22.180]  as we saw during alcohol prohibition it's the rival drug gangs that are
[02:57:22.180 --> 02:57:25.300]  shooting each other in the street that's really the source of it it's not the
[02:57:25.300 --> 02:57:30.060]  legal gun owners we've seen many many cases where they can stop an attack
[02:57:30.060 --> 02:57:34.100]  because of course even the best police can't be there we've seen the police
[02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:40.700]  chief of Detroit tell us that he says he wants his people in his jurisdiction to
[02:57:40.700 --> 02:57:44.420]  have their own firearms because he said no matter how hard they try they can't
[02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:49.060]  be there when a when a crime is being committed we saw a mother defend her
[02:57:49.060 --> 02:57:55.860]  family from a home break in using a weapon in Detroit now the police subsequently
[02:57:55.860 --> 02:58:00.900]  caught the intruders but she scared them off with some gunshots if she hadn't
[02:58:00.900 --> 02:58:04.260]  had a gun they would have broken in who knows what they would have done to her
[02:58:04.260 --> 02:58:08.680]  to her family and the police chief there fortunately learned his lesson he
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:12.900]  had been a a policeman in California where he believed in gun control then
[02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:16.900]  he went to Maine and he started realizing hey these people out in these
[02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:20.700]  rural areas they're very heavily a large percentage of the population owns
[02:58:20.700 --> 02:58:24.820]  firearms and look at how low the crime is and so he took that message with him
[02:58:24.820 --> 02:58:30.500]  to Detroit and it's been people like him people like Jim Girok with law
[02:58:30.500 --> 02:58:33.140]  enforcement against prohibition they're the ones who really understand what's
[02:58:33.140 --> 02:58:37.500]  going on David Letterman is just looking for badly desired attention we'll be
