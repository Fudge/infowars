[00:00.000 --> 00:27.480]  The
[00:27.480 --> 00:32.760]  world health organization recommended forcibly removing family members from their homes and
[00:32.760 --> 00:40.120]  putting them in quarantine. Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may
[00:40.120 --> 00:46.840]  be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner. Queen Elizabeth seemed
[00:46.840 --> 00:53.720]  to be echoing this idea to the UK. It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made in 1940,
[00:53.720 --> 01:02.040]  helped by my sister. We as children spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated
[01:02.040 --> 01:10.360]  from their homes and sent away for their own safety. Today, once again, many will feel a
[01:10.360 --> 01:18.960]  painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now as then, we know deep down that it is the
[01:18.960 --> 01:24.760]  right thing to do. Bill Gates has been pushing the idea of tracking people with digital tattoos,
[01:24.760 --> 01:34.160]  and Microsoft was recently granted patent number 0600606 for a cryptocurrency surveillance system
[01:34.160 --> 01:45.220]  connected to the human body. Now enter HR6666. To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human
[01:45.220 --> 01:52.780]  Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19 and
[01:52.780 --> 02:00.580]  related activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units and as necessary at
[02:00.580 --> 02:08.700]  individuals' residences and for other purposes. On May 1st of 2020, Illinois Congressman Bobby
[02:08.700 --> 02:17.440]  Rush introduced HR6666. This act is essentially setting up a nationwide contact tracing and
[02:17.440 --> 02:25.680]  quarantine program run by Big Pharma. Section 2, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing using
[02:25.680 --> 02:33.800]  mobile health units will allow Bill Gates loyalist Alex Azar and the CDC to fund eligible entities
[02:33.800 --> 02:40.880]  to conduct tests, trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the
[02:40.880 --> 02:48.280]  quarantine of these contacts via mobile health units. Who are the eligible entities qualified
[02:48.280 --> 02:55.200]  to receive this funding? Health centers, non-profit organizations, high schools, and anyone else
[02:55.200 --> 03:01.800]  that Alex Azar deems eligible. The amount of taxpayer dollars being asked for to trace the
[03:01.800 --> 03:09.200]  public and force quarantines is $100 billion for 2020 alone and whatever may be necessary
[03:09.200 --> 03:25.440]  as long as the emergency period continues. For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[03:25.440 --> 03:33.440]  The naïveté of our best political minds that are pro-human is very dangerous. But I
[03:33.440 --> 03:48.640]  understand what's happening. They are projecting their own humanity onto the decisions that
[03:48.640 --> 03:57.240]  the establishment's making. And that is a grave mistake, a very, very serious mistake.
[03:57.240 --> 04:06.200]  Like clockwork, Barack Obama, the United Nations, the WHO, Bill of Melinda Gates, all
[04:06.200 --> 04:17.440]  opened fire on the president, all scientifically prepared in the last 48 hours. We have plotted
[04:17.440 --> 04:24.480]  their operations with precision because I'm inside their head. It's actually very easy
[04:24.480 --> 04:29.080]  to defeat them, and that's why they are so scared that if President Trump listens to
[04:29.080 --> 04:36.640]  me, it's over for them. But the truth is, no matter what happens to me, you understand
[04:36.640 --> 04:44.480]  the paradigm, I didn't tell you what to think. You see what I see. And once you see it, you
[04:44.480 --> 04:53.240]  never go back. I'm Alex Jones. Remember, the way we defeat the globalist is your will,
[04:53.240 --> 04:56.640]  and you taking action. It's an Info War.

[06:25.320 --> 06:36.200]  Alex Jones. 174 days out from the election. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Thank you for
[06:36.200 --> 06:42.800]  joining us on this May 12th, Tuesday, 2020 transmission. We've got a lot of big guests
[06:42.800 --> 06:52.240]  coming up today. Your calls and so much breaking news. Faustus, Mr. Fauci, Dr. Faustus is in
[06:52.240 --> 06:59.040]  the Senate right now, like a snake attacking the president as much as he can without being
[06:59.040 --> 07:04.840]  removed from his position of power, bringing America into hysteria and collapsing the United
[07:04.840 --> 07:10.880]  States. He, of course, is testifying from his home because the earth is so toxic and
[07:10.880 --> 07:18.200]  so evil and so bad, and then humans are so bad that we must all no longer shake hands
[07:18.200 --> 07:24.400]  or love each other because, again, biology is bad. Only silicon is good. Carbon bad,
[07:24.400 --> 07:36.120]  silicon good. Post-human world. Extermination of the parasite humans. We come in peace.
[07:36.120 --> 07:41.240]  For those of us that understand the Globalist Plan and who have actually read with the Council
[07:41.240 --> 07:45.560]  on Foreign Relations and the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group and these other organizations
[07:45.560 --> 07:53.200]  have said, we know how the book ends. We know as we turn each page what we're going to see
[07:53.200 --> 07:59.560]  because it's their world. We're just living in it because we have dialed into Hollywood,
[07:59.560 --> 08:03.680]  dialed into sports, dialed into all the bread and circuses and distractions that they've
[08:03.680 --> 08:19.240]  laid out for us, the poison buffet, that we've given over our destiny. But for anyone that
[08:19.240 --> 08:25.360]  actually studies the Globalist and how they operate and what their in-game is and what
[08:25.360 --> 08:32.440]  makes them tick and what their philosophy and ethos is, this is like shooting fish in
[08:32.440 --> 08:41.520]  a barrel. It's like two plus two equals four. It's absolutely elementary, my dear Watson.
[08:41.520 --> 08:48.680]  But you've got to have the courage to admit what's coming at you. And I liken it as an
[08:48.680 --> 08:56.400]  allegory or an analogy or a parable to most big comets and asteroids that end up being
[08:56.400 --> 09:00.960]  found aren't found by the big radio telescopes or not found by the big observatories. Most
[09:00.960 --> 09:07.200]  of them are found by the millions of amateur astronomers that have high-powered equipment
[09:07.200 --> 09:16.480]  now thanks to capitalism, what would cost $100 million 50 years ago, cost $5,000 today,
[09:16.480 --> 09:23.120]  telescopes that can aim at stars, constellations, planets, asteroids, Kuiper belts, and even
[09:23.120 --> 09:31.320]  follow objects in real time with just a few numbers you dial in to the keypad. Back in
[09:31.320 --> 09:41.800]  1993, I had to go down to a university warehouse and pay $25,000 for a 12-inch refractor telescope
[09:41.800 --> 09:47.160]  that had just come out, that had the McDonald Observatory technology in it, that had cost
[09:47.160 --> 09:51.200]  tens of millions of dollars, but now it was miniaturized. And I could aim it at Jupiter,
[09:51.200 --> 09:58.520]  aim it at Saturn, aim it at Uranus, aim it at Pluto, aim it at Venus, aim it at Mars,
[09:58.520 --> 10:04.480]  and it would track for hours through the night sky, tiny servo motors that go out in the
[10:04.480 --> 10:10.360]  hill country, sometimes by myself with a six pack of beer and spend all night looking at
[10:10.360 --> 10:17.560]  the stars. And so imagine today you can go to Walmart and buy one for like $1,000 when
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.560]  I paid $27,000 for. That's the empowerment of technology. That's the good side of technology
[10:22.560 --> 10:32.640]  on a double-edged sword. So imagine if you're like Shoemaker Levy, amateur astronomers, they
[10:32.640 --> 10:37.200]  were professors, but with their telescope found the big comet that was going to slam
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.160]  into one of the gas giants 30 years ago, and you become world famous because the establishment
[10:42.160 --> 10:48.120]  isn't really looking, they're just posing like they're scientifically curious. And imagine
[10:48.120 --> 10:55.840]  you see coming out of the Kuiper Belt out past Pluto, a 10th planet, a 20th planet,
[10:55.840 --> 11:01.520]  a 100th planet, there's hundreds of them out there now they've scanned. And it's coming
[11:01.520 --> 11:07.680]  in and you see it and you're like, I'm an amateur astronomer and I've taken photographs
[11:07.680 --> 11:15.320]  of this thing entering our solar system. It's now past Pluto, it's coming in at a million
[11:15.320 --> 11:20.160]  miles an hour, and it's going to get here in six months. And you go tell your local
[11:20.160 --> 11:25.080]  news, you tell the FBI, you tell the local astronomer club, and they laugh at you. But
[11:25.080 --> 11:29.480]  more people begin to aim their telescopes up in the sky and they pick it up and they
[11:29.480 --> 11:37.040]  see it coming. And then you ask the question, how did all the government and industry observatories
[11:37.040 --> 11:43.040]  not see this? How did the CIA not see this? How did NASA not see this? And then you come
[11:43.040 --> 11:51.640]  to the realization, oh my God, they know this planet's coming in to our solar system. Why
[11:51.640 --> 12:04.480]  did they make the decision not to tell us? And then you come up with the realization
[12:04.480 --> 12:11.080]  the mathematicians that it's going to hit Earth. And you go, oh my God, they don't want
[12:11.080 --> 12:18.680]  us to panic. But if we panic, we could put spacecraft out there and go out and meet it
[12:18.680 --> 12:25.680]  with nuclear weapons and blow it up. Then you hit the realization they want humanity
[12:25.680 --> 12:32.160]  to die. And then you look at that planet a little bit closer and you notice it's got
[12:32.160 --> 12:39.040]  an ion trail behind it and it's got a propulsion system behind it and it's not a planet. It's
[12:39.040 --> 12:46.360]  a planetoid weapon aimed at Earth to kill us. It's an alien attack. And then you look
[12:46.360 --> 12:51.640]  at your leaders and you say, who are you with? Why are you doing this? Now, that's an allegory.
[12:51.640 --> 12:56.080]  They'll have headlines today that Jones believes a 10th planet's coming to kill the Earth and
[12:56.080 --> 13:05.280]  aliens running. No, I don't believe that. What I'm telling you is the biologicals, the GMOs,
[13:05.280 --> 13:11.640]  the 4G, the 5G, the 6G, they've already got 7G being tested. All of it makes Earth uninhabitable
[13:11.640 --> 13:17.760]  to carbon-based lifeforms. And then you study what the globalists are openly saying. They
[13:17.760 --> 13:25.000]  believe they're going to merge with silicon and become these gods. And then you have the
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.200]  realization that a decision has been made for an evolutionary path that we didn't choose
[13:33.200 --> 13:42.600]  and that we're being overwritten, not genetically, but chemically, by silicon. And so you can
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.560]  debate who came up with it. Is it the devil? Is it aliens? Whatever you want to call it,
[13:47.560 --> 13:53.360]  it's anti-human and it's the philosophy of Big Tech and the philosophy of the ruling
[13:53.360 --> 14:03.280]  scientific dictatorship that resonates with psychotic coldness. And so that's the M4 story.
[14:03.280 --> 14:08.200]  Imagine if you were an astronomer and you saw this planet coming towards Earth and you
[14:08.200 --> 14:12.120]  tracked it and you knew it was going to hit Earth in six months. And you knew within just a
[14:12.120 --> 14:16.560]  couple months it'd be visible to everybody and you wouldn't be able to deny it. So the
[14:16.560 --> 14:22.080]  government comes and arrests you. Would you feel bad being in jail? Like you were a loser? No,
[14:22.080 --> 14:29.280]  you feel sad for everybody because everybody's going to die. And see, that's the allegory.
[14:29.280 --> 14:35.520]  I'm not worried about Alex Jones. I've read the white papers where Bill Gates says he wants to
[14:35.520 --> 14:41.800]  kill everybody down to 500 million. Ted Turner, all of them have said that. Jeffrey Epstein managed
[14:41.800 --> 14:47.600]  the group. But every time I kind of get concerned like, hey, these guys are psychotic killers and
[14:47.600 --> 14:51.840]  are coming after me, I'm kind of like, well, it's okay. At least I won't have to watch my
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.560]  children die. And really, that's where I've mentally gotten. So when everybody understands
[14:56.560 --> 15:02.480]  something, I'm not a hero. If an asteroid or a planetoid was coming at Earth, and we had a year
[15:02.480 --> 15:07.440]  to stop it or six months to stop it, I'd say, we need maximum effort, put spacecraft up there,
[15:07.440 --> 15:13.080]  10 to 1. I don't want backup plans. Blow that thing up. Let's send one mission out there on a
[15:13.080 --> 15:16.800]  suicide mission. You know, we've got astronauts that would do it. They would want to catch it way
[15:16.800 --> 15:20.880]  before it got to Earth. They drive the missile in themselves to save their family. And then let's
[15:20.880 --> 15:26.000]  have backup plans if that fails to blow it off course before it gets here. We would all line up
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.560]  and be ready to die for that. Because we get there's something bigger, our families, our culture,
[15:30.560 --> 15:36.160]  the future of humanity. That's what matters, not our individualism. But the collectivists,
[15:36.160 --> 15:39.840]  they're all a bunch of selfish people who actually aren't collectivist. They're actually
[15:39.840 --> 15:45.520]  satanic individualists. But that's that paradox, that economy. I am the ultimate individual. And
[15:45.520 --> 15:51.280]  then I'm the ultimate collectivist. The satanists are individualists who are anti freedom, anti
[15:51.280 --> 15:54.400]  group. That's why they tell you all day they're for the group because they're not.
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.920]  Holland Block has really been a sleeper product for us. We got it in a few years ago. It's an amazing
[16:01.920 --> 16:07.360]  product that comes from all natural quail eggs. They discovered this more than 30 years ago in
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.960]  France that if you ate quail eggs from a certain type of quail, that it had an anti histamine
[16:12.960 --> 16:18.960]  effect and people saw their allergies and seasonal discomfort knocked way, way down. Well, now this
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.560]  is available in the United States. It's proprietary. It has rave reviews. It's a product that I never
[16:24.560 --> 16:30.320]  even really promote, but that people keep reordering and has become a best seller. We're very close to
[16:30.320 --> 16:35.040]  selling out Holland Block right now. It'll take eight weeks to get more in. But despite that,
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.480]  I'm going to sell it at 50% off until it sells out. So for those of you that have never ordered it
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.680]  and been on the fence and have seasonal discomfort, experience Holland Block for yourself right now
[16:45.680 --> 16:52.080]  at infowarstore.com for 50% off Holland Block. I want people that haven't tried it,
[16:52.080 --> 16:55.680]  tried for themselves. So it's the lowest price ever, even though it's selling out.
[16:56.800 --> 17:02.560]  What info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth
[17:02.560 --> 17:10.720]  has been nothing short of historic and truly epic. This is the battle for the future of humanity. And
[17:10.720 --> 17:18.320]  now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet. Now,
[17:18.320 --> 17:24.800]  the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized. You must decide which side
[17:24.800 --> 17:30.560]  you're on. Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness will only deliver
[17:30.560 --> 17:37.200]  you into misery, destruction, and finally death. And this is a spiritual death. We're talking about
[17:37.200 --> 17:44.400]  not just a physical death. The delusions must end now. Info wars was correct about it all.
[17:44.400 --> 17:48.800]  And we have come so far by exposing the enemy. Most people that are aware of the new order
[17:48.800 --> 17:55.040]  decide to join it out of fear. They are truly fools. We must fight this or lose our souls.
[17:55.040 --> 18:01.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:25.200 --> 18:32.240]  This isn't a simulation. It's not a drill. It's not a joke. It's not a game.
[18:33.360 --> 18:35.840]  I'm covering real issues here on air and everybody knows it.
[18:36.720 --> 18:41.520]  That's why they want to stop the air. But thanks to you, thanks to you, we're still here and still
[18:41.520 --> 18:50.800]  fighting. I'm going to reset and next segment, I am going to launch into their master plan and
[18:50.800 --> 18:57.200]  what's currently happening and what's unfolding. But you notice we lay out exactly what they would
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.920]  do and that when Trump didn't lock down, they would say it was all his fault. When he did lock
[19:01.920 --> 19:07.520]  down at first, they'd say, great job. Now keep it locked down. You're a bad guy. Then they start
[19:07.520 --> 19:13.600]  blaming the economy on Trump and try to remove it thinking you don't have logic and aren't smart.
[19:13.600 --> 19:18.800]  And that's why you see Fauci and Billa Melinda Gates and the UN all coming out against the
[19:18.800 --> 19:26.400]  United States and Brazil and the UK of all places because they're not going along with the
[19:26.400 --> 19:34.880]  globalist completely. Obama Gates coming out now, but Obama isn't attacking Trump to cover up
[19:34.880 --> 19:45.600]  Obama. They were always planning to emerge and blame President Trump for this. And now right on
[19:45.600 --> 19:52.080]  time, you see that happening. You know, I thought about talking about the president, what really
[19:52.080 --> 19:58.080]  goes on in the White House from my sources to give you a bird's eye view or a fly on the
[19:58.080 --> 20:07.040]  wall view into just how interesting Trump is. But I don't even know if I can do it justice
[20:07.040 --> 20:14.720]  because it's actually a lot of it's critical of the president,
[20:16.720 --> 20:18.640]  but then a lot of it's positive of the president.
[20:21.760 --> 20:28.720]  You know what? Last segment of this hour remind me to do it, guys. I will,
[20:28.720 --> 20:38.080]  I'll tell you what's really going on with Trump. And it's very, very sad. It's very, very pathetic.
[20:40.960 --> 20:46.480]  It's also very, very empowering and real and freaks me out even more.
[20:48.080 --> 20:53.280]  But how to explain this properly? I mean, one could spend months writing a speech about something
[20:53.280 --> 20:59.120]  this big and I just got to lay it out to the best I can here. So I will.
[21:03.360 --> 21:08.720]  But what folks do now understand is we're not in Kansas anymore. Let me just do this.
[21:09.760 --> 21:13.760]  Let's already played this clip a couple of times, but there's so much new news. But
[21:13.760 --> 21:20.160]  sometimes the new news is a distraction, right? Let's play Bill Gates last week with Stephen
[21:20.160 --> 21:24.480]  Colbert, with the monkey see monkey do their both at home and their palatial mansions.
[21:25.920 --> 21:32.080]  And Colbert is groveling to Bill Gates, who's the frontman for all the big Robert Baron money.
[21:37.200 --> 21:41.840]  And he's saying, you predicted everything. You're incredible. Tell me what's coming next.
[21:41.840 --> 21:46.640]  And Gates goes, well, I'm not happy about this because they know it all backfired his gloating
[21:46.640 --> 21:53.760]  and his predicting what he himself did, what his group did. And he goes, yeah, this is
[21:54.480 --> 22:00.480]  event one, event two is coming. It's a bio weapon attack. Now, remember, I told you when event 201
[22:00.480 --> 22:05.840]  came out last year, I said, this is the beginning of all the new events and COVID-19 is named that
[22:05.840 --> 22:12.160]  like each year you get a new virus and your savior Bill Gates. And you do what they say,
[22:12.160 --> 22:17.120]  you take the chips, you take the inoculations, and you get to go outside. We told you years ago,
[22:17.120 --> 22:21.040]  that was the plan, because they wrote about it. And now it's here that he's in the news today
[22:21.040 --> 22:26.640]  going, I told Trump right after he was elected in 2016, get ready for lockdowns and get ready for
[22:26.640 --> 22:30.960]  all this. And he didn't listen to me. He didn't agree with that. He's not good.
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  But separately, people go, yeah, Gates did predict all this. And he did basically finance the
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.040]  wool on lab. And so did Fauci. Wow, they stand again. And he wants to depopulate people. But
[22:43.040 --> 22:47.440]  now he won't go, oh, I don't want to depopulate anybody. And I didn't predict anything. They
[22:47.440 --> 22:51.680]  have all these articles now that he didn't predict anything. He's trying to tell Colbert, hey, hey,
[22:51.680 --> 22:58.400]  stop it. I'm not invested in all this. And I'm not involved that I didn't predict it. Stop,
[22:58.400 --> 23:03.920]  stop. But I will tell you, the next one's going to be a lot worse. How many times have I told
[23:03.920 --> 23:08.640]  you how this works? It's common sense. They launched a simulate they own, they put vaccines
[23:08.640 --> 23:13.440]  in you that are binary weapons that lower your immunity. And then they start releasing the real
[23:13.440 --> 23:20.560]  stuff. So I just want everybody to know parties over, they decided to drop the hammer. And it's
[23:20.560 --> 23:25.120]  only going to get worse from here on out until we totally overthrow these people, these unelected
[23:25.120 --> 23:30.880]  criminals that think they're on our lives. In fact, we come back, pull up a David Knight's
[23:30.880 --> 23:34.320]  pin tweet. It may not be pinned now, but it was pinned this morning when I saw it from a couple
[23:34.320 --> 23:38.960]  days ago. Bill Gates isn't a doctor. He's not an epidemiologist. He's not a virologist.
[23:38.960 --> 23:44.240]  Who gave him the keys to the universe? Why does he rule our world? Because he's the front man.
[23:45.520 --> 23:51.920]  His mother and his father were in the boards of the World Depopulation Society, the World
[23:51.920 --> 23:59.280]  Eugenics Society, Planned Parenthood, the World Birth Control Forum. Gates is not a doctor. He's
[23:59.280 --> 24:05.680]  not an epidemiologist. He's not elected. Gates is not even a lifetime bureaucrat. So why is he the
[24:05.680 --> 24:14.560]  authority? Is this a planned demic, DARPA funded news guard and election guard now running your
[24:14.560 --> 24:22.400]  elections meet your master? So here is Billy Boy tipping his hand again because criminals
[24:22.400 --> 24:31.440]  love to brag. That's 101 in criminology. Here it is. Bill, since you tried to warn us about
[24:31.440 --> 24:37.520]  this pandemic and we didn't listen, what's the next thing you're warning us about that's going
[24:37.520 --> 24:44.720]  to happen five years from now that we're not listening to at the present? Well, I didn't want
[24:44.720 --> 24:50.800]  to be right. What I wanted to do is I understand. I'm not saying you won. Everybody loses. Nobody
[24:50.800 --> 24:54.560]  wins with us. And I'm not saying that you're sure that you're this is not an end zone dance.
[24:54.560 --> 25:00.560]  I'm just saying what else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now? Well,
[25:01.360 --> 25:08.480]  the the idea of a a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because they're
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.400]  a pathogen with a high death rate would be ticked. Now, the good news is, okay,
[25:12.400 --> 25:20.640]  depression is too late. Now, most of the work we're going to do to be ready for pandemic two,
[25:20.640 --> 25:25.600]  I call this pandemic one, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the
[25:25.600 --> 25:32.000]  things we need to do to minimize the threat of bias. Notice they're wearing the same glasses.
[25:33.040 --> 25:37.360]  Get boss and notice all the MSNBC and CNN hosts are wearing the same glasses.
[25:37.360 --> 25:41.040]  And so does the head of the World Health Organization. And then all the support is
[25:41.040 --> 25:46.880]  down where the same glasses. It's all little uniforms. It's all little cutesy behavior for you.
[25:46.880 --> 25:52.480]  These are sick freaks, like a Nazi armband. So you want to know your enemy? There they are. He
[25:52.480 --> 25:57.280]  goes into forced inoculations, tracking systems, can't leave your house, martial law, permanent
[25:57.280 --> 26:03.520]  martial law and Fauci just gave him a testimony to that. We'll come back and play that. But I thought
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.760]  you should want to see that for yourself because Bill Gates is just so happy there. We talked about
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.720]  collapse, never coming back. He gets all happy when he talks about this horrible
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.360]  bio attack that's coming. He gets real happy. And he could be on with a comic. He could be on
[26:17.360 --> 26:23.520]  with CNN. The freaks are curious. It's all the same. So this is their plan. And they think you're
[26:23.520 --> 26:28.000]  dumb and won't resist it. That's why they're all wearing masks and the Senate hearings. It's all
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.320]  just to show you it's a power grab. But you can fight back. Your word of mouth is paramount.
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.960]  And I can't describe to you how powerful you are. We just tell friends, neighbors,
[26:38.960 --> 26:43.280]  families, every day, random people about info wars.com, forward slash show and
[26:43.280 --> 26:46.240]  fan dot video and about the local radio and TV stations that carry the show.
[26:47.200 --> 26:50.640]  That's how we change this is your power. And by the way, people are waking up.
[26:50.640 --> 26:54.640]  We're on the razor's edge, though. It could go either way right now. You could tip the balance.
[26:54.640 --> 27:00.080]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is like
[27:00.080 --> 27:05.600]  shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot. And then it finally dies.
[27:05.600 --> 27:10.080]  She said, well, yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in the
[27:10.080 --> 27:15.200]  street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the head had
[27:15.200 --> 27:20.800]  blood pouring out a huge hole. He was holding it. He walked around gibbering talking nonsense for
[27:20.800 --> 27:26.400]  about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead. Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[27:26.400 --> 27:32.240]  It is in cardiac arrest. This has been done by design and the UN the chai comms the mainstream
[27:32.240 --> 27:38.640]  media orchestrated it hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed. So remember the depression
[27:38.640 --> 27:45.200]  that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN on Bill and Melinda Gates on Obama on
[27:45.200 --> 27:50.800]  Hillary on Biden on the Democrats. We tried to stop it. We tried to fight it. You guys said you
[27:50.800 --> 27:55.120]  wanted to wreck America and the world and now you've done it. Congratulations. One of the best

[30:25.120 --> 30:34.960]  I tell you, this song from Van Halen 1984, is it? Panama is kind of hard to turn off right now.
[30:34.960 --> 30:45.280]  Yeah, it's running a little bit hot tonight. Weak down between my legs. Ease the seat back. Good stuff.
[30:49.040 --> 30:50.160]  Those are the good old days.
[30:53.680 --> 30:58.400]  Still a free country. Credible opportunity out before us.
[30:58.400 --> 31:06.080]  But we gave up on the freedom, gave up on our rights and now click. We're inside the tyranny.
[31:08.560 --> 31:11.280]  Maybe we should come in next segment with a part where he's talking about,
[31:12.320 --> 31:15.680]  I can barely see the road from the heat coming on. That's good. Shut it off there.
[31:17.040 --> 31:22.000]  Let's get serious. We all know that mainstream corporate media lies.
[31:22.000 --> 31:31.600]  We all know that ABC News said that Trump greenlit Turkey blowing up a major Turkish city.
[31:35.120 --> 31:39.760]  And instead they showed a machine gun shootout in Nob Creek, Kentucky,
[31:41.120 --> 31:48.800]  and said the 10 foot tall plumes of fire from gasoline cans being shot was 4,000 foot mushroom
[31:48.800 --> 31:54.960]  clouds as skyscrapers were vaporized. The Kurds didn't have skyscrapers.
[31:56.480 --> 32:02.320]  There weren't 10,000 foot, 4,000 foot plumes of fire. There was 10 foot plumes of fire.
[32:02.320 --> 32:06.960]  And you've got the smaller and you've got all the other lies and there's too many to go overall.
[32:06.960 --> 32:12.240]  And you've got CBS News caught with fake lines of cars, the employees of the hospital,
[32:12.240 --> 32:16.160]  to show lines there and people in hazmat suits lined up around the block
[32:16.160 --> 32:22.320]  to get in and get health care when it's empty. We told you that two months ago and we're attacked.
[32:26.560 --> 32:32.000]  I even had some own crew come to me and say, Alex, you really think in New York in places
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.120]  they'll really stage fake lines of cars and fake people in hazmat suits? And I said, yeah,
[32:37.120 --> 32:42.000]  locals went and shot video and showed it's fake. I believe them. I could look at the tape and see
[32:42.000 --> 32:50.720]  it was fake. And it's now confirmed. Let's see. It's just a blip. And the line between
[32:50.720 --> 32:56.240]  entertainment and fiction and reality has been blurred where a lot of people just decide now
[32:56.240 --> 33:02.720]  what they want to believe. Well, Bill Barr, the U.S. Attorney General, who is proving to be more
[33:02.720 --> 33:08.640]  and more independent of the globalist every day, at least pro-American trying to unseat the communist
[33:08.640 --> 33:24.320]  Chinese influence over America, they had Chuck Todd and NBC News take a CBS news piece.
[33:24.960 --> 33:31.440]  We're in the same Senate, she says. We have the rule of law. And that's why we're doing
[33:31.440 --> 33:36.880]  what we're doing. And I believe in the rule of law. And the rule of law was violated going
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.720]  after General Flynn. So that's why we entered this investigation and admitted it was a travesty
[33:40.720 --> 33:44.880]  of justice. Prosecutors shouldn't continue something when it's been proven to be a fraud.
[33:46.800 --> 33:52.720]  That's what will produce belief in the system again. That's not perfect, but at least not
[33:52.720 --> 34:01.760]  known to be a fraud and predatory. Buddy went on to say, but history is written by the victors.
[34:01.760 --> 34:11.200]  And if the deep state wins, they'll say all this is legitimate. In the same sentence,
[34:11.840 --> 34:15.680]  he said, this is about rule of law. So Chuck Todd didn't just edit it down.
[34:17.280 --> 34:24.240]  He said, Bill Barr doesn't care about the rule of law. And when asked about the rule of law,
[34:24.240 --> 34:32.080]  he said, ethic. So he didn't just edit it deceptively. When someone specifically said,
[34:37.280 --> 34:41.760]  I believe that we shouldn't be racist. Chuck Todd turned it around and said,
[34:41.760 --> 34:48.160]  Bill Barr in that speech said, I love Hitler. So they didn't just lie.
[34:48.160 --> 34:57.120]  They then put words in his mouth that weren't true on top of it. And I don't feel guilty
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.200]  for being nasty to the globalist because I research what I say about him and I can prove
[35:03.200 --> 35:09.600]  what I say about him. But sometimes it does feel nasty to say stuff I know is true about Bill Gates,
[35:09.600 --> 35:14.160]  that he's a eugenicist and a depopulation person and someone that says kill old people and kill
[35:14.160 --> 35:23.200]  Africans. But I have the damn quotes and video clips. But with these people, they have the clip
[35:23.200 --> 35:28.640]  in the same 10 seconds saying rule of law, I believe will win. And Chuck Todd says, well,
[35:28.640 --> 35:34.560]  he doesn't believe in the rule of law, he said. And that's the thing about these liars. They're
[35:34.560 --> 35:45.920]  uncreative. They'll take the truth, you said, and they invert it. It's unbelievable. But that's
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.400]  who these people are. They've been caught with fake numbers on COVID the entire time on purpose.
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.000]  They've been caught putting the names of everybody that died of something else on COVID.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.720]  And the same liars now don't give up. They triple, quadruple, quintuple down.
[35:58.720 --> 36:05.840]  And out of the side of their mouth go, by the way, we want to shut the economy down to stop
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.640]  Trump. These dumbasses don't get what's happening to them. Well, I get what's going on, buddy boy.
[36:11.200 --> 36:16.400]  And I don't like it, Chuck Todd. Tucker Carlson did a good job on this last night. He pointed
[36:16.400 --> 36:20.560]  out Chuck Todd's wife's a big media consultant and a government consultant. Chuck Todd worked for
[36:20.560 --> 36:27.040]  Obama. What do you mean? There are these political hacks up there acting like they're telling you
[36:27.040 --> 36:36.160]  the truth. Here it is. They repeated verbatim with solemn faces. Over the weekend, Chuck Todd of NBC
[36:36.160 --> 36:41.680]  accused the Attorney General Bill Barr of gutting the rule of law, of ignoring it completely.
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.320]  And to prove that, Chuck Todd used what seemed to be quite a damning quote. Watch this.
[36:47.280 --> 36:53.520]  I want you to listen to this Bill Barr answer to a question about what will history say about
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.440]  this. Wait till you hear this answer. Take a listen. When history looks back on this decision,
[37:00.400 --> 37:03.600]  how do you think it will be written? Well, history is written by the winner,
[37:03.600 --> 37:11.200]  so it largely depends on who's writing the history. I was struck peggy by the cynicism of
[37:11.200 --> 37:16.320]  the answer. It's a correct answer, but he's the Attorney General. He didn't make the case that
[37:16.320 --> 37:24.160]  he was upholding the rule of law. Struck by the cynicism. Chuck Todd, who was married to a political
[37:24.160 --> 37:29.920]  consultant, was just struck by the cynicism. He could barely believe it. He was stunned.
[37:30.880 --> 37:38.080]  Bill Barr didn't even mention upholding the rule of law. Kind of a major omission for an Attorney
[37:38.080 --> 37:47.040]  General. But wait, it turns out that Bill Barr did mention the rule of law. It was at the center
[37:47.040 --> 37:53.840]  of his answer. Now that was a CBS tape. NBC got ahold of it and edited out the words to
[37:53.840 --> 38:01.440]  distort Bill Barr's meaning. We have the real tape. Here it is. When history looks back on this
[38:01.440 --> 38:07.040]  decision, how do you think it will be written? Well, history is written by the winner, so it largely
[38:07.040 --> 38:14.320]  depends on who's writing the history. But I think a fair history would say it was a good decision
[38:14.320 --> 38:22.240]  because it appealed the rule of law. Yeah, to be clear, Catherine Harris did not edit that tape.
[38:22.240 --> 38:25.760]  She did a straightforward interview. NBC News edited it. Now, let's stop there.
[38:27.760 --> 38:32.960]  So the heart of what he said is, I believe in rule of law. They invert that and say,
[38:32.960 --> 38:38.320]  he said he doesn't believe in the rule of law. Think of the magnitude of these criminals because
[38:38.320 --> 38:47.520]  think this was on national CBS News. And CBS is the second most powerful network in the world
[38:48.560 --> 38:55.920]  after ABC. You can argue which one's bigger. So this is like in front of 50 million people,
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.360]  the real clip, they edit the clip and don't just play an edited clip. They then lie about what was
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.240]  said in the full clip because they believe they have censorship power and control. And that's
[39:06.240 --> 39:11.840]  why they want to censor everybody so that you can't challenge these ridiculously gigantic frauds.
[39:11.840 --> 39:17.520]  Now, I've got Fauci testimony and there's a bunch of it with horrible martial law announcements.
[39:17.520 --> 39:21.520]  I've got, I want to get into what's really going on with Trump and how he's surrounded when we
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.840]  come back. And then I've got a Bill Gates compilation. We haven't aired yet. And I've
[39:25.840 --> 39:30.240]  got a special guest I haven't told you about yet. That's coming up too. And I've also got to fund
[39:30.240 --> 39:33.600]  this operation. We've got great products. Everybody already needs. We've got a big sale that's

[40:59.200 --> 41:04.800]  when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run
[41:05.760 --> 41:12.560]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards. They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and
[41:12.560 --> 41:17.840]  through their veins. But all of a sudden they slow down. They realize what's happened. They fall over
[41:17.840 --> 41:23.920]  and they die. Then you go back and haul them back in. Well, that's what's going to happen to the
[41:23.920 --> 41:30.560]  entire world now. And that's what the economic numbers show is that we've been shot right in the
[41:30.560 --> 41:35.840]  heart. And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[41:36.640 --> 41:39.840]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to
[41:39.840 --> 41:45.200]  UN and I believe their numbers, because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate
[41:45.200 --> 41:48.720]  the third world. So that all the leftists had thought it was their revolution to get rid of
[41:48.720 --> 41:52.720]  Trump. You're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[41:54.640 --> 42:02.400]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election. It is a referendum of national sovereignty against
[42:02.400 --> 42:08.240]  localism. And Obama, Hillary and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President
[42:08.240 --> 42:13.520]  Trump's election. And they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president.
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.240]  Now they've been pushing COVID-19 shut down the economy and created depression. Well,
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.840]  China's already been open for business for more than a month. This is an ongoing globalist attempt
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.800]  to punish the American people, wreck our economy and hope that we won't recognize that it is they,
[42:28.800 --> 42:34.160]  the New World Order, that have orchestrated this and not President Trump. They know their crimes
[42:34.160 --> 42:39.520]  are coming out. They know the tickets are coming home to roost. So now they're panicking and trying
[42:39.520 --> 42:45.840]  to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[42:45.840 --> 42:52.400]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hopes and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[42:52.400 --> 42:58.240]  So get out there and expose this fraud. It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization
[42:58.240 --> 43:05.200]  to build up the world economy to where it is. Every economist is on record saying that as this
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.920]  economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world
[43:09.920 --> 43:15.200]  and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world and that the general public is going to go
[43:15.200 --> 43:20.160]  into deep, deep debt to the mega banks. They're not going to have medical ID cards forced in
[43:20.160 --> 43:28.000] oculations. We are now in a giant dystopia. But a lot of people are waking up and there is a major
[43:28.000 --> 43:34.640]  backlash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights, rediscover
[43:34.640 --> 43:40.240]  our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and
[43:40.240 --> 43:45.840]  say shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives. No, it's caused millions to
[43:45.840 --> 43:50.000]  already starve to death, tens of millions more. So the cowards who went along with us with your
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.160]  virtue signaling, you have destroyed your lives and our lives. Congratulations.
[43:54.160 --> 44:13.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:13.680 --> 44:21.040]  You've never been driving out of kind of an empty highway late at night.
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.240]  You just say I don't care the police pulling over. You're driving that really fast sports car.
[44:26.880 --> 44:31.600]  You just lean back, push the seat back and press on the accelerator, crank it up.
[44:33.520 --> 44:35.440]  Yeah, we're running a little bit hot tonight.
[44:38.640 --> 44:41.360]  I can barely see the road from the heat coming off.
[44:41.360 --> 44:48.800]  Reach down, reach down, between my legs, ease the seat back.
[44:50.960 --> 44:52.240]  I'm going 170.
[44:58.560 --> 45:00.080]  All right, little nostalgia here.
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.400]  I don't drive fast anymore, but I have had a car up to almost 200 miles an hour.
[45:06.400 --> 45:15.120]  It's fun. You just got to get on a stretch that nobody's on like I 30 out here. Oh my gosh,
[45:15.120 --> 45:20.560]  midnight out there. There's not a damn car. Three, four lanes, absolutely smooth. I was
[45:20.560 --> 45:25.920]  one about 150 a while back and there's one hump about 20 miles south of Austin and the car just
[45:25.920 --> 45:37.360]  goes like Duke's a hazard, man. Duke's a hazard. All right, let's stop right there. I don't tell
[45:37.360 --> 45:42.320]  these stories to act cool because acting cool was the most uncool thing there is.
[45:44.240 --> 45:50.320]  I only tell these stories to demystify them and to get everybody down to what really matters,
[45:50.320 --> 45:57.120]  your family, yourself and your relationship with God because I was never a huge Hollywood fan,
[45:57.120 --> 46:04.720]  but I mean, I had a chance that a couple years on air to be scooped up and to be put into Hollywood
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.600]  and to get to meet a lot of big famous people and hang out with them and stuff. And it was kind of
[46:09.600 --> 46:15.040]  interesting until I saw how unhappy they were unless they were rejecting Hollywood and didn't
[46:15.040 --> 46:20.720]  want to be part of it. Those were the cool people, people like Woody Harrelson, Matthew McConaughey,
[46:20.720 --> 46:26.640]  you know, the list goes on and on and I got to meet all those folks through Richard Linkletter
[46:27.920 --> 46:34.080]  and then I got called out to Hollywood and they wanted to, you know, Mark Cuban and Harvey Weinstein
[46:34.080 --> 46:47.920]  and all of them. I mean, I'd been in meetings with those people and they were so unhappy and so weird
[46:52.160 --> 46:56.160]  that I didn't want to have any part of them. I didn't know they tried to indict Mark Cuban
[46:56.160 --> 47:00.880]  for meeting with me. Even came out the New York Times later, Mark Cuban released the emails
[47:00.880 --> 47:09.280]  of the U.S. Attorney Southern District threatening to arrest him if he put one of my films in
[47:09.280 --> 47:20.720]  movie theaters. Mark Cuban had already not done the deal. So I don't tell you those stories to go,
[47:20.720 --> 47:28.240]  oh, I know Hollywood people. It's like saying I once saw a dead dog in the ditch or I once saw
[47:28.240 --> 47:42.800]  a dead possum in the ditch. I once wallowed in metaphysical feces. It's not some proud thing,
[47:42.800 --> 47:46.880]  but what I want you to know is because you've never been there, people always think the grass
[47:46.880 --> 47:52.160]  is greener on the other side like, oh, there's that place over there. If I was just in Hollywood,
[47:53.440 --> 47:57.120]  how many women and men go to Hollywood, they get in a TV show, they get in a movie,
[47:57.120 --> 48:03.200]  they make a few million dollars and they commit suicide. You know, Hollywood stars have the
[48:03.200 --> 48:09.760]  highest suicide rate there is because it's empty and they were talented real people and they went
[48:09.760 --> 48:19.680]  and gave themselves to something that was destructive. So the reason I tell that part
[48:19.680 --> 48:31.840]  of the story is that's how you get the entrance into it. And so I'd already rejected Hollywood
[48:33.120 --> 48:40.240]  completely 10 years ago. And the crazy part about it was it's like a woman. Once you don't want them,
[48:40.240 --> 48:45.120]  they really want you. It's like, okay, here's a $3 million deal to star in this movie.
[48:45.120 --> 48:59.200]  It's a space fantasy movie. And you're a space captain. And I remember they told me the movie
[49:00.160 --> 49:05.840]  and like six years later, I'm in the theater watching this big, huge movie. And I'm like,
[49:05.840 --> 49:10.960]  wow, it would have been cool to play that guy, but it's like the most valuable thing in my life
[49:10.960 --> 49:15.200]  other than my children and doing the right thing. Well, it's not most valuable, but like for things
[49:15.200 --> 49:21.680]  like that is that that's a big giant franchise. You know, Kurt Russell was in the second one.
[49:22.160 --> 49:29.440]  And I turned it down. How freaking cool is that, man? That is like incredibly valuable to me
[49:29.920 --> 49:36.480]  that in the final equation, they were offering me major huge movies just to join Satan.
[49:36.480 --> 49:44.080]  I remember Mark Dice called me up about eight years ago and he goes, he goes, it's a it's
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.600]  just crazy. You know, you're involved in the same TV production company, I know, because they put
[49:49.600 --> 49:53.920]  out this Ventura show. I got up in this meeting with the head guy and he wanted me to worship
[49:53.920 --> 50:00.480]  Lucifer. I said, yeah, I know, Mark. Well, I refuse. I said, I know he was going to have a
[50:00.480 --> 50:10.320]  Nicky six national TV show and Mark Dice is a good guy. He told him, piss up a rope. He wasn't
[50:10.320 --> 50:18.240]  getting on his knees in that conference room to the devil. I mean, the general public has no
[50:18.240 --> 50:24.640]  idea how all this works. Ladies and gentlemen, no idea.
[50:24.640 --> 50:30.480]  So if I was going to tell you about Donald Trump,
[50:34.880 --> 50:36.560]  I'd have to tell you about that, wouldn't I?
[50:44.480 --> 50:51.360]  So should, should I tell you about Donald Trump? It's not like I'm even holding it back or like
[50:51.360 --> 50:57.840]  wetting the appetite. It's like, how do I explain this correctly? Because I've described this a
[50:57.840 --> 51:02.560]  thousand times. I'll do it again. If you're at the Grand Canyon and you've never, you're trying to
[51:02.560 --> 51:07.120]  tell a family member, it's never been at the Grand Canyon about being at the one, one of the main
[51:07.120 --> 51:11.840]  lookouts. You've never seen anything like it. Like you're looking 20 miles at a canyon. It's, it's
[51:11.840 --> 51:16.560]  like, then you never see anything like it. You're like telling family, yeah, you got to go to the
[51:16.560 --> 51:23.840]  Grand Canyon. It's incredible. They go, what's it like? You got to see it. One time I was somewhere
[51:23.840 --> 51:30.160]  in Colorado. I forget driving and I came to these mountains in this pass and it looked like Valhalla
[51:30.160 --> 51:35.680]  with these green fields and, and, and the, and the, and the mountains and the clouds and the sun.
[51:35.680 --> 51:42.160]  It was so beautiful with a rainbow. I like pulled the car over and I was like, this isn't even real.
[51:42.160 --> 51:49.600]  You know what I mean? It's kind of like those moments. Everything Hollywood has to offer is
[51:49.600 --> 51:57.280]  like eating glass coated in rotten meat and then everything God has to offer is like Valhalla and
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.880]  your beautiful wife and your amazing children and, and, and, and, and everything that's strong and
[52:02.880 --> 52:10.960]  it's like, why would it, because people want the grass on the other side. So I've got all this news
[52:10.960 --> 52:14.720]  and I've got a big guest coming up and I really want to be able to cover all this.
[52:16.320 --> 52:20.240]  But I just want you to know that rejecting the system is the answer
[52:21.680 --> 52:27.760]  and rejecting the establishment is the answer and the idea that you drive an old crappy car and
[52:29.520 --> 52:35.760]  all the rest of it, you got varicose veins on your hips. That isn't you. Your connection to God
[52:35.760 --> 52:41.520]  is you and that's beautiful and I see people that have the most wrecked old messed up bodies,
[52:41.520 --> 52:47.040]  but they've got God, their eyes are beautiful. I can see their spirit. They are amazing and I
[52:47.040 --> 52:52.320]  see the most beautiful people that don't have God and their eyes are dead and they're not attractive.
[52:52.320 --> 52:58.080]  It's like a woman that has God is even their body's not that good. It doesn't matter. They're
[52:58.080 --> 53:03.280]  beautiful. A woman that serves Satan could be the most beautiful body you ever imagined. It's
[53:03.280 --> 53:11.840]  like a plastic mannequin. It's not real. Speaking of that, I'm not some angel. I just love justice
[53:11.840 --> 53:16.400]  and freedom and I got to fund my operation against the enemy in this world and all the systems they
[53:16.400 --> 53:22.080]  have and it's your financial support that breaks the will of the globalist. And so everyone needs
[53:22.080 --> 53:25.760]  durable food. We have the best highest quality you're going to find out there that's ready to
[53:25.760 --> 53:30.880]  ship to you and your family and info or store.com. We have a big super sale that's going to have to
[53:30.880 --> 53:34.560]  end on this weekend. Some of these things are going to have to be taken off the next few days
[53:34.560 --> 53:40.720]  because they're about to sell out like info or protein bars, eight pack power stack, X2 DNA
[53:40.720 --> 53:47.200]  Force plus living defense, real red pill, real red pill plus ultra 12. This is all 30 to 60% off.
[53:47.200 --> 53:52.720]  These are all great products, stuff made by God here on the planet and that funds our operation.
[53:52.720 --> 53:58.880]  I suggest you take advantage of it, but I've got so much news to cover here, but I just first wanted
[53:58.880 --> 54:05.760]  to get up here and say I reject Hollywood and I reject Satan and I reject their system and I don't
[54:05.760 --> 54:10.880]  need them to be whole and be empowered. In fact, embracing them is like living death.
[54:11.920 --> 54:16.720]  Instead of not needing them, it's like you're about to go swimming and somebody goes, can I tie
[54:17.360 --> 54:21.120]  a giant lead weight 100 pounds to your body and you're like, I don't need that effect. I don't
[54:21.120 --> 54:31.120]  want that. But it's a lead weight. I mean, it's cool. CNN said so. No. I don't want that bowling
[54:31.120 --> 54:36.800]  ball tied around me. Reject the globalist. Reject Microsoft. Reject Bill Gates. Reject
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.840]  Satan. Renounce Satan. Embrace Christ. Jesus Christ.
[54:41.840 --> 54:51.120]  This is the end, my friends. My only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end
[54:51.920 --> 54:59.280]  of everything that stands the end. The safety, the delusion. It's all over, ladies and gentlemen,
[54:59.920 --> 55:06.800]  because there was only the mirage of safety. Movies and partying and living like children,
[55:06.800 --> 55:12.480]  never growing up, never caring about other people. This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[55:13.200 --> 55:17.840]  Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states. Every time Israel became corrupt
[55:17.840 --> 55:23.600]  and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity because their people
[55:23.600 --> 55:29.520]  sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved. We are
[55:29.520 --> 55:36.400]  repeating that again today. Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.480]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom. Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support
[55:42.480 --> 55:49.360]  and your prayers. The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media
[55:49.360 --> 55:55.600]  and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression. In fact, we're already
[55:55.600 --> 56:00.400]  into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world, but it's critical to
[56:00.400 --> 56:07.440]  understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be. A month of shutdown
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.480]  will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy. That's why we've always
[56:12.480 --> 56:17.040]  said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[56:17.040 --> 56:22.400]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control. They've admitted all of this.
[56:22.400 --> 56:29.280]  So remember, how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[56:29.280 --> 56:34.800]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan
[56:34.800 --> 56:39.600]  and yes, it's dystopic and yes, it's scary, but denying it and letting them carry it out
[56:39.600 --> 56:55.040]  is a thousand times more scary. It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[57:10.560 --> 57:17.680]  On inauguration day 2017, it's likely that not one in a hundred thousand Americans was thinking
[57:17.680 --> 57:21.920]  about Russia. It was the last thing most people were thinking about. The Cold War had ended
[57:21.920 --> 57:28.160]  peacefully more than 25 years before Moscow was no longer America's main strategic rival as it had
[57:28.160 --> 57:33.360]  been for 50 years. Russia had been downgraded instead to the status of a regional power consumed
[57:33.360 --> 57:38.800]  disputes with obscure places like Ukraine. In the American media, there were more stories about
[57:38.800 --> 57:44.880]  Russian alcoholism than there were about Russian ICBMs. But in the White House in Washington that
[57:44.880 --> 57:50.400]  morning, Russia was very much the main topic. It was January 20th, the last day of the Obama
[57:50.400 --> 57:55.920]  administration. Outgoing national security adviser Susan Rice sat down at her desk to write her final
[57:55.920 --> 58:00.880]  memo. Rice described the presidential transition which had been underway for months. Then she
[58:00.880 --> 58:06.320]  wrote this, during a meeting two weeks before, quote, President Obama said he wants to be sure
[58:06.320 --> 58:11.840]  that as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason we
[58:11.840 --> 58:18.400]  cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia. Now, Rice did not explain why Obama's
[58:18.400 --> 58:23.360]  staff felt it might not be possible to give intelligence on Russia to Donald Trump's staff,
[58:23.360 --> 58:27.680]  or for that matter why the Obama people thought they had the right to withhold national security
[58:27.680 --> 58:33.120]  information from an incoming American president who had just won a national election. But Rice
[58:33.120 --> 58:38.560]  didn't need to elaborate. There was only one possible explanation for this. Donald Trump could
[58:38.560 --> 58:44.720]  very well be a Russian agent. Barack Obama himself said he believed that was possible.
[58:44.720 --> 58:51.040]  In Rice's words, quote, the president asked Jim Comey to inform him if anything changes in the
[58:51.040 --> 58:55.760]  next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team.
[58:56.480 --> 59:02.720]  Comey said he would. Now, what exactly does that mean? Here's what it means. The president of
[59:02.720 --> 59:07.280]  the United States turned to the head of the FBI, the most powerful law enforcement official in
[59:07.280 --> 59:13.040]  America, and said, continue to secretly investigate my chief political rival so that I can act against
[59:13.040 --> 59:20.880]  him. Comey's response? Yes, sir. That's what Obama was saying openly. In any normal period
[59:20.880 --> 59:26.320]  in American history, this exchange would define Barack Obama forever. Obama would be known as
[59:26.320 --> 59:31.280]  the disgraced former president who used federal law enforcement to hurt his political enemies.
[59:31.280 --> 59:36.800]  That's what he did. Unfortunately, this is not a normal period. Already today, Obama's order
[59:36.800 --> 59:42.560]  that Comey investigate Donald Trump has been relegated to a little known footnote. Joe Biden
[59:42.560 --> 59:47.680]  happened to be sitting in the room when this happened. Has Biden ever been asked about that?
[59:47.680 --> 59:52.160]  It's possible he never has been. Most media outlets have ignored the origins of the Russian
[59:52.160 --> 59:58.080]  conspiracy hoax completely. And as a result of that, Barack Obama's plan to derail his successor
[59:58.080 --> 1:00:03.920]  unfolded with very little opposition along the way, including from Republicans. The entire
[1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:08.720]  country, therefore, spent the first three years of the Trump administration hyperventilating
[1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:15.520]  about Russian collusion that did not exist. Susan Rice assiduously did her part to help it along.
[1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:21.680]  Here's Rice in July of 2017 a year and a half later, suggesting a network television that the
[1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:49.760]  president of the United States was indeed working for Vladimir Putin. Does that mean you think it's
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:54.640]  an open question whether or not he's compromised by Russia? George, I don't know what his motivations
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:01:01.920]  are. I think that's a legitimate question. In fact, it was never a quote legitimate question. It was
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:08.080]  a reckless slur, the most reckless possible slur, the kind that damages a whole country along with
[1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:12.880]  a politician it's aimed at. Rice knew perfectly well there was no evidence at all that Donald
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:17.840]  Trump had ever worked for Russia. We know that she believed that because she admitted as much under
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:22.640]  oath in a closed-door hearing in Congress. As Rice explained to the House Intelligence Committee,
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:27.520]  the reason she was willing to accuse Trump officials of treason against their own country
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:33.120]  was that some of them seemed unduly worried about the rise of China. Here's what Susan Rice, for
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:38.960]  example, said. The four reports on Band-Aub video, he exposes other Hong Kong agents. If you're a
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:43.520]  trader against your country, you try to then save those trying to stop one of the traders.
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:50.880]  And you know, I feel pathetic that maggots like Susan Rice almost destroyed America.
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:59.680]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship. The lockdown is designed to have the public accept
[1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:07.040]  their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the
[1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:13.840]  Bill and the Gates Foundation in full control. Many will submit through fear, others will be bought
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:20.640]  off, but in the end, the globalists submit they're building a post-human world. And now that we're
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:28.240]  inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its endgame. Submission to this is a
[1:02:28.240 --> 1:02:35.680]  form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:41.440]  that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this. This is your dignity, your
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:48.400]  soul, your future being poured inside out. This is a scientific dictatorship to in full control
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.840]  of humanity for its own selfish, disgusting power trip.
[1:02:51.840 --> 1:03:10.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:16.400]  So thousands of flights a week fly into the United States, thousands into the UK,
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:22.080]  hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, millions into the United States, but you're told
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:28.400]  stay in your house, you're a criminal, we've got to watch you, you're all suspect. Well Fauci's
[1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:39.600]  ongoing with his Senate hearing right now and in clip 15 we're about to play. Fauci, this Bill Gates
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:47.920]  funded creature says that checkpoints and guidelines, identification, isolation, contact
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:53.760]  tracing is the key. And remember they put all normal deaths, heart attacks, cancer, the flu,
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:04:04.720]  gunshot wounds, skydiving accidents. If you fall and hit your head, dying, your shower,
[1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:13.360]  COVID-19, that's all confirmed. Oh, but Fauci, who's self quarantining, oh, because the White House
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:18.560]  has a contagion, eight secret service, they have thousands of meatpacking employees
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:26.560]  that tested positive. No one's sick, asymptomatic, because the tests are a fraud, new test, new disease.
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:33.520]  Going along with the fraud when the media says you're a hero. Well, you're a hero for Hitler,
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:38.320]  you're a hero for you, Genesis, to depopulate the world, because the first world collapse
[1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:44.320]  means death for the third world. Here's Fauci announcing his reasonable martial law.
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:53.120]  I've said many times publicly, what we have worked out is a guideline framework of how you
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:59.920]  safely open America again. Let's start it over. What we have worked out is a guideline,
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:06.720]  how you safely, I won't tell you how you're safe. You take a Bill Gates vaccine, you wear a mask
[1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:14.960]  and get hypoxia. It doesn't matter all my graphs were 50 times wrong. You do what I say. We're
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:22.400]  making a move. Let's hear from him. I've said many times publicly, what we have worked out
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:30.560]  is a guideline framework of how you safely open America again. And there are several checkpoints
[1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:37.600]  in that with a gateway first of showing, depending on the dynamics of an outbreak in a particular
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:45.600]  region, state, city or area, that would really determine the speed and the pace with which one
[1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:55.200]  does reenter or reopen. So these private groups that are in control, they decide when you reopen.
[1:05:55.200 --> 1:06:04.320]  And big corporations always stay open. You don't stay open. Continue. I get concerned if you have
[1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:10.640]  a situation with a dynamics of an outbreak in an area such that you are not seeing that gradual over
[1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:18.640]  14 day decrease that would allow you to go to phase one. They said five million dead. They said
[1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:22.400]  two million dead. They said, if you don't lock down for 15 days, it all happens. Then when it
[1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:27.040]  didn't happen, and it was 50 times lower, they went, it's because you locked down. But now there's
[1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:32.160]  not a decrease because it's a tiny little graph at the bottom that goes up and down because they
[1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:39.360]  count all deaths. Let's see. Oh, oh, it's not the big thing they said. They're totally wrong. Now
[1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:45.120]  it's like, oh, it's an increase. So they zoom in on this little hump down here to where it looks big.
[1:06:46.080 --> 1:06:50.960]  And this is total fraud. This guy's the biggest fraud I've ever seen in my life.
[1:06:52.720 --> 1:07:01.360]  Oh, he gets concerned. He got $100 million from Bill Gates last November. Let's hear from him.
[1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:08.640]  14 day decrease that would allow you to go to phase one. And then if you pass the checkpoints of phase
[1:07:08.640 --> 1:07:15.760]  one, go to phase two and phase three. What I've expressed then, and again, is my concern that
[1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:23.520]  if some areas, cities, states or what have you, jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely
[1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:30.640]  open up. They pause again. He knows you're lazy. He knows you don't pay attention. They said it'd
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:35.120]  be up at five million dead than two million dead than a million dead. And now they're like, it's
[1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:43.360]  bigger than we thought. It's a thousand dead. Oh my goodness, you can't ever go out again. We went
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:49.760]  over the number we thought. We're like, it's not five million. It's not two million. I'm sorry,
[1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:56.240]  you don't want anyone to die. Do you? He sounds like some weird Bugs Bunny character.
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:03.120]  It's about shutting our economy down. It's about control. It's about driving Trump from office,
[1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:10.720]  and we know it. And now Obama and Hillary and Bill him on the gates. First, it was his wife
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:18.000]  attacked Trump this weekend. Oh, you get a D minus. Because you didn't keep things closed.
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:23.520]  Bill Gates is like, we're never reopening. It's so happy. Here, let's hear more from Dr. Faustus.
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:29.760]  Bill Gates. The ability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently. My concern is that
[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:35.440]  we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks. So therefore, I have been
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:41.120]  back in the 20 seconds because I told you fake numbers about five million dead and three million
[1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  dead, two million dead. Instead of admitting I'm a fraud. Now we're going to look all we have five
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:55.360]  cases. We have five cases in South Korea. They got a close. Oh my gosh, we've got 15 cases in
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:04.480]  Germany. It's a spike. Look, it's a spike. We're all dead. Sorry, you can't ever open up again.
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:11.120]  Let's hear more from Fauci. And prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to
[1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:17.200]  respond effectively and efficiently. Here's something. Oh, remember, we got a 15 days to the
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:22.560]  hospitals aren't overwhelmed with the five million dead. Governor Newsom said we had my five million
[1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:33.760]  dead in California. It's like 4,000. Got these people were fraud. But you get the emotion like,
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:38.000]  I'm a hero. I'm wearing a mask. I'm a hero. I don't go to work. I'm a hero.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:45.520]  Look, Fauci self-quarantining. Did you hear? They had a breakout in the White House. Some of the
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:52.080]  Secret Services had it. Are they sick? Well, no, but it's scary. Bill Gates said I've got to take
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:57.520]  a shot and I'm going to take it so I can go out again. Let's hear more from Fauci.
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:04.160]  Clear in my message to try to the best extent possible to go by the guidelines which have
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:11.280]  been very well sought out and very well delineated. Then pause again. The go by the guidelines that
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:19.120]  have been very well thought out and very well delineated. If I said Austin Texas would have no
[1:10:19.120 --> 1:10:24.640]  rain today and it's raining cats and dogs like it is right now, I'd be a bad weather person,
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:32.400]  a meteorologist. They put out the fakest numbers the galaxy's ever seen. And we're supposed to sit
[1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:38.640]  there and we're supposed to take it. Let's hear now more from the doctor. Consequences could be
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:45.680]  really serious particularly and this is something that I think we also should pay attention to
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:52.720]  that states even if they're doing it at an appropriate pace which many of them are and will
[1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:58.640]  namely a pace that's commensurate with the dynamics of the outbreak that they have in
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:06.320]  place already. The capability that when there will be cases there is no doubt even under the best
[1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:14.080]  of circumstances. When you pull back on mitigation you will see some cases appear. It's the ability
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:19.840]  and the capability. Oh no, pause again. We can't ever let anyone die and we have a test that says
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:26.160]  everyone is positive. You have to stay in your home and do what I say. Let's hear more from him.
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:33.120]  The ability and the capability of responding to those cases with good identification isolation
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:40.320]  and contact tracing will determine whether you can continue to go forward as you try. We will
[1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:46.160]  decide if you can go forward when our fake test we're going to take you and arrest you.
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:56.320]  We are doing a good job for you. Let's hear that again. Return of infections occur.
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:02.800]  We have the capability of responding to those cases with good identification isolation and
[1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:09.680]  contact tracing will determine whether you can continue to go forward as you try to reopen
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:16.400]  America. So it's not only doing it at the appropriate time, appropriate time, but having
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:22.160]  in place the capability of responding when the inevitable return of infections occur.
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:28.800]  The inevitable return because they chose a test that says everyone has it. You're all guilty.
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:35.840]  You're all bad. I run your life now. I work for Bill Gates. I ran the Wuhan lab. But never mind
[1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:44.720]  that. Facebook and Google and Twitter and Apple will ban you if you question me. I am your God.
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:54.160]  I am Fauci. China wins. Fauci wins. The America that we've known and loved, the America that was
[1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:59.600]  the land of the free home of the brave is dying right now. And everything our enemies are doing
[1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:04.960]  is about domesticating us, shutting us down and making us dependent on them. The food shortages
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:09.920]  have begun. The depression is going to be long and very, very serious. In fact, it's probably too
[1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:14.000]  late now to even turn back. Trump tried to stop it. But the mainstream media working with the
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:20.320]  tricombs blocked it. That's why you and myself, everybody else, has to get prepared now. Do not
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:24.480]  wait. It's not about the virus. It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in

[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:23.440]  Another world, another time, in the age of wonder, another world, another time, in the age of
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:38.400]  wonder. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas.
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:46.640]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. So look,
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:52.320]  watching the Senate hearings with these corrupt evil senators, most of them,
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:59.760]  and watching them all owe their homes. It's so deadly. It's so dangerous. And everyone's wearing
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:04.560]  masks in the White House and ain't Secret Service. Haven't that nobody's sick and thousands of meat
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:11.200]  packers haven't that no one's sick. Why is it all old people? Usually new viruses kill young people
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:16.960]  because of autoimmune response. Like bees normally kill young people because of an autoimmune response
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:22.160]  or allergies. It's because they're putting it on the death certificate and that's confirmed.
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:27.280]  Why is it a bio weapon? It's patented so Bill Gates owns it.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:35.920]  So here's Senator Paul, the articles up on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[1:16:35.920 --> 1:16:42.400]  Rand Paul blast lockdown tells Fauci, you're not the end all Oh Fauci, you're a medical doctor.
[1:16:42.400 --> 1:16:48.400]  Involved in the AIDS scam and involved in all the AZT drugs that killed people.
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:56.480]  Here's part of that video. Respect you Dr. Fauci. I don't think you're the end
[1:16:56.480 --> 1:17:01.120]  all I don't think you're the one person that gets to make a decision. We can listen to your advice,
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:04.560]  but there are people on the other side saying there's not going to be a surge and that we can
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:08.960]  safely open the economy and the facts will bear this out. But if we keep kids out of school for
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:13.120]  another year, what's going to happen is the poor and unapproved kids who don't have a parent that's
[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.440]  able to teach them at home are not going to learn for a full year. And I think we got to look at
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:21.280]  the Swedish model and we got to look at letting our kids get back to school. It's a huge mistake
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:26.080]  if we don't open the schools in the fall. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, can I respond to that even
[1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:32.480]  though there are only 32 seconds left? Yes, and you might make it clear whether or not you suggested
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:40.160]  that we shouldn't go back to school in the fall. Well, first of all, Senator Paul, thank you for
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:45.840]  your comments. I have never made myself out to be the end all and only voice in this. I'm a scientist,
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:52.400]  a physician. I'm a scientist. He attacks the president when he does he put out fake numbers.
[1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:59.200]  The guy told you that the Pop Warner Football League was going to win the Super Bowl. They
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:05.280]  don't even play high school football. They play elementary school. You're a frickin' fraud, Fauci.
[1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:09.520]  Fauci stands for fraud or effing America over.
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:16.880]  The Democrats are so delusional. He's a Democrat. You know, Elon Musk is like,
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:22.080]  you shut us down for months. We're going bankrupt. And the Democrat legislature went FU Elon Musk.
[1:18:22.080 --> 1:18:28.880]  Now he's moving to Texas. He's globalist art delusional.
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:35.760]  I didn't say I was the end all be all. I'm just in control of all the policy
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:43.520]  and undermining the president. Oh, but I'm on lockdown because oh, I might have been near
[1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:51.200]  somebody had the COVID, the COVID. All your smucks buying into this man. You make me sick.
[1:18:51.200 --> 1:18:56.480]  Let's continue. Your comments. I have never made myself out to be the end all and only voice in
[1:18:56.480 --> 1:19:02.320]  this. I'm a scientist, a physician. Back it up. The media acts like this guy's the second coming
[1:19:02.320 --> 1:19:11.440]  to Christ. I've never made myself out to be the end all be all. I put all these fake numbers in
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:18.560]  your bow to me. Let's continue with President Fauci. Bill Gates is butt boy. Thank you for your
[1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:24.160]  comments. I have never made myself out to be the end all and only voice in this. I'm a scientist,
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:30.240]  a physician and a public health official. I give advice according to the best scientific evidence.
[1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:35.360]  There are a number of other people who come into that and give advice that are more related to
[1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:39.680]  the things that you spoke about, about the need to get the country back open again.
[1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:46.000]  All by Bill Gates advice about economic things. I don't get advice about anything other
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:51.200]  than public health. So I wanted to respond to that. The second thing is that you use the word we
[1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:56.240]  should be humble about what we don't know. And I think that falls under the fact that we don't
[1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:00.800]  know everything about this virus. And we really better be very careful, particularly when it comes
[1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:07.280]  to children. Because the more the children, because I made it in the bio weapon lab with Bill Gates.
[1:20:07.920 --> 1:20:12.080]  Oh, they've got different. Oh, exactly. Remember Bill Gates said the bad one. Remember how I told
[1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:17.920]  you hundreds of times the bad ones coming? Because they're going to make you know, oh, it was a hoax.
[1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:22.560]  Oh, they're going to hit with a real one soon. But they're the ones behind it.
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:29.280]  So just remember when you're dying, Bill Gates loves you. Let's hear from Dr. Faustus again.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:36.640]  Studies in China or in Europe. For example, right now, children presenting with COVID-16
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:42.960]  when COVID-19, who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome, very similar to Kawasaki
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:49.520]  syndrome. Oh, it's very scary. If we are not cavalier and thinking that children, oh, if we
[1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:57.360]  don't do what he says, and shut up the whole world, we're cavalier now. You're cavalier.
[1:20:57.360 --> 1:21:05.040]  How about your $100 million you got from Bill Gates last year? Oh, so cavalier Fauci. Continue
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:11.520]  with Fauci. Be careful if we are not cavalier and thinking that children are completely immune
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:18.000]  to the deleterious effects. So again, you're right in the numbers that children in general
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:24.880]  do much, much better than adults. We got something special ready. Oh, I am very careful
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:30.720]  and hopefully humble in knowing that I don't know everything about this disease. Because he
[1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:36.000]  cooked it up at Wuhan. I told you, you're going to get used to COVID, folks. It doesn't just eat
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:44.640]  men's balls. Oh, it's coming. Oh, it's coming. Oh, he's going to get you good. He's so liberal.
[1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:53.280]  But everyone bow to him. Wear your mask. Learn to be locked down. Bill Gates and Fauci are coming.
[1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:57.680]  I have a Bill Gates compilation. We're going to play when we come back.
[1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:03.840]  I know you have a special guest I haven't told you about yet. It's on him FullWars.com,
[1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:07.120]  who the guest is, the live show feed. We got to print me the live show feed article, please.
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:13.360]  Thanks. I want to print that every day. I'll pull it up. Here's the name of the live show feed today.
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:17.280]  It's on him FullWars.com. You might want to share it with people.
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:22.400]  Only way we reach new folks is when you do that or you just roll over to Fauci and let him
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:33.760]  let him be God. Live coverage of Fauci Senate testimony plus new hashtag Obamagate Bombshells.
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:47.040]  And we have Dr. Stephen Greer also joining us to discuss a possible fake UFO invasion.
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:55.040]  That's what I told the crew today. Fake. I'm glad i read that. It's fake, fake, fake, fake,
[1:22:55.040 --> 1:23:09.760]  fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, project blue beam. Fake you and UFO invasion. Fake, fake, fake, fake,
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:15.680]  artificial, mice, fake, UFO. Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake straight fake,
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:40.220]  fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake fake undertone no
[1:23:40.220 --> 1:23:43.520]  Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:46.020]  From the 19, you were an invasion, you have a lot of
[1:23:46.020 --> 1:23:49.660]  evasion, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
[1:23:49.660 --> 1:23:52.620]  Hollam Block has really been a sleeper product for us.
[1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:54.220]  We got it in a few years ago.
[1:23:54.220 --> 1:23:57.980]  It's an amazing product that comes from all natural
[1:23:57.980 --> 1:23:58.820]  quail eggs.
[1:23:58.820 --> 1:24:00.820]  They discovered this more than 30 years ago in France
[1:24:00.820 --> 1:24:04.820]  that if you ate quail eggs from a certain type of quail,
[1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:06.420]  that it had an antihistamine effect
[1:24:06.420 --> 1:24:09.660]  and people saw their allergies and seasonal discomfort
[1:24:09.660 --> 1:24:11.300]  knocked way, way down.
[1:24:11.300 --> 1:24:13.780]  Well, now this is available in the United States
[1:24:13.780 --> 1:24:15.020]  as proprietary.
[1:24:15.020 --> 1:24:16.460]  It has rave reviews.
[1:24:16.460 --> 1:24:19.100]  It's a product that I never even really promote,
[1:24:19.100 --> 1:24:22.300]  but that people keep reordering and has become a best seller.
[1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:25.540]  We're very close to selling out Hollam Block right now.
[1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:27.220]  It'll take eight weeks to get more in,
[1:24:27.220 --> 1:24:30.060]  but despite that, I'm gonna sell it at 50% off
[1:24:30.060 --> 1:24:31.180]  until it sells out.
[1:24:31.180 --> 1:24:33.500]  So for those of you that have never ordered it
[1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:36.300]  and been on the fence and have seasonal discomfort,
[1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:38.740]  experience Hollam Block for yourself right now.
[1:24:38.740 --> 1:24:43.300]  At m4store.com for 50% off Hollam Block.
[1:24:43.300 --> 1:24:46.220]  I want people that haven't tried it for themselves
[1:24:46.220 --> 1:24:49.100]  so it's the lowest price ever, even though it's selling out.
[1:24:50.460 --> 1:24:53.060]  The United States is not communist China.
[1:24:53.060 --> 1:24:55.980]  We don't have three million people in concentration camps.
[1:24:55.980 --> 1:24:57.900]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:24:57.900 --> 1:25:01.060]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs,
[1:25:01.060 --> 1:25:03.340]  but all over the news, we see the UN,
[1:25:03.340 --> 1:25:05.940]  available in the gates, WHO,
[1:25:05.940 --> 1:25:09.220]  mainstream corporate media praising communist China
[1:25:09.220 --> 1:25:10.380]  for their response.
[1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:12.860]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints
[1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:14.580]  and welds people into their houses
[1:25:14.580 --> 1:25:16.340]  and has robots controlling people,
[1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:17.940]  well then gee, we've got to do that.
[1:25:17.940 --> 1:25:20.620]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio Pass Laws
[1:25:20.620 --> 1:25:23.660]  saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[1:25:23.660 --> 1:25:25.540]  Well now Cuomo in New York's calling it
[1:25:25.540 --> 1:25:26.780]  the European virus.
[1:25:26.780 --> 1:25:29.900]  These people are out of control, control freaks,
[1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:32.020]  and they are gonna lose big time
[1:25:32.020 --> 1:25:34.900]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities
[1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:37.220]  and are exposing them in their power grab.
[1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:41.220]  The resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[1:25:41.220 --> 1:25:44.380]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats
[1:25:44.380 --> 1:25:46.460]  and then we'll be able to defeat their operation
[1:25:46.460 --> 1:25:47.460]  that much quicker.
[1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:51.660]  One of our best selling products is living defense
[1:25:51.660 --> 1:25:53.700]  and it's been sold out for over four months
[1:25:53.700 --> 1:25:56.540]  because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[1:25:56.540 --> 1:25:57.900]  We've got a limited supply right now
[1:25:57.900 --> 1:25:59.220]  but it's selling out fast.
[1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:00.300]  And I want those of you that have it
[1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:02.660]  the experience of living defense to get it for yourself.
[1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:04.220]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:07.020]  I look, in January, 2016, I went in a hospital.
[1:26:07.020 --> 1:26:09.180]  I went in the VA hospital out here in Boise
[1:26:09.180 --> 1:26:10.500]  and I was in there until June.
[1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:13.260]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal
[1:26:13.260 --> 1:26:16.100]  was listening to infowars three hours a day
[1:26:16.100 --> 1:26:17.780]  and I kept hearing Dr. Group
[1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:19.780]  and all you guys talking about living defense.
[1:26:19.780 --> 1:26:20.700]  Let me tell you something, man.
[1:26:20.700 --> 1:26:23.300]  I had an internal digestive problem
[1:26:23.300 --> 1:26:25.740]  and I stumbled with it for about five or six years
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:27.580]  and the doctors, they tried every test.
[1:26:27.580 --> 1:26:29.140]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:30.940]  And then every day when I kept hearing you
[1:26:30.940 --> 1:26:32.460]  and Dr. Group and those commercials,
[1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:33.820]  I said, you know what, I'm gonna get me
[1:26:33.820 --> 1:26:35.300]  some of that freaking living defense.
[1:26:35.300 --> 1:26:37.060]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals
[1:26:37.060 --> 1:26:38.340]  because they don't want you to have a stuff.
[1:26:38.340 --> 1:26:40.140]  But I ordered it, it shipped to me.
[1:26:40.140 --> 1:26:41.940]  I got it, I hid it from the nurses.
[1:26:41.940 --> 1:26:43.380]  I started taking it, man.
[1:26:43.380 --> 1:26:45.860]  That stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[1:26:45.860 --> 1:26:48.900]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[1:26:52.140 --> 1:26:55.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:26:55.220 --> 1:27:00.220]  From the front lines of the information war,
[1:27:04.020 --> 1:27:05.900]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:27:05.900 --> 1:27:10.900]  So remember that Fauci stands for fake.
[1:27:17.820 --> 1:27:19.700]  Fauci stands for fraud.
[1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:24.300]  Fauci stands for effing up America.
[1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:29.620]  And everything this little lying scumbag has said is a fraud.
[1:27:29.620 --> 1:27:31.340]  And despite all the internet censorship
[1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:33.660]  trying to protect this little monster,
[1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:35.700]  he is being exposed big time.
[1:27:35.700 --> 1:27:38.820]  But the problem is, PA governor threatens
[1:27:38.820 --> 1:27:42.540]  to withhold federal stimulus from non-compliant counties.
[1:27:43.460 --> 1:27:47.740]  Your salons, your five and dimes,
[1:27:47.740 --> 1:27:50.660]  your shoe repair stores, your farms.
[1:27:50.660 --> 1:27:53.740]  It's all shut down.
[1:27:53.740 --> 1:27:56.060]  Only big corporations can operate.
[1:27:56.060 --> 1:27:57.780]  How discriminatory.
[1:27:57.780 --> 1:28:00.860]  But sitting in this whole fighting over black or white
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:03.540]  while they discriminate against the little guy
[1:28:03.540 --> 1:28:05.020]  and build the post human world.
[1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:08.300]  Now, that story's up on infowars.com.
[1:28:08.300 --> 1:28:12.540]  Meanwhile, YouTube CEO admits users don't like
[1:28:12.540 --> 1:28:15.540]  boosting of authoritative, that means establishment content.
[1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:18.220]  But they do it anyways.
[1:28:19.620 --> 1:28:21.820]  And she's heavily invested in Black Socialists
[1:28:21.820 --> 1:28:24.100]  with her evil sister.
[1:28:24.100 --> 1:28:29.020]  And their other director of content came out
[1:28:29.020 --> 1:28:31.100]  and said, we don't care about our users,
[1:28:31.100 --> 1:28:32.980]  they're a bunch of basement dwellers.
[1:28:34.220 --> 1:28:37.820]  This is the trash that runs the planet.
[1:28:38.780 --> 1:28:40.180]  But Limbaugh has come out
[1:28:40.180 --> 1:28:45.180]  and said that, oh, Obama's attacking Trump now
[1:28:48.300 --> 1:28:50.820]  because Obama gate came out.
[1:28:53.060 --> 1:28:58.060]  No, Fauci, the lima indicates Obama,
[1:28:58.500 --> 1:29:00.620]  they're all attacking because they were always planning
[1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:04.340]  during the Senate hearings to blame Trump for COVID-19.
[1:29:04.340 --> 1:29:10.140]  That's why Cuomo called it the European virus.
[1:29:10.140 --> 1:29:12.180]  And you're like, that's ridiculous.
[1:29:12.180 --> 1:29:13.060]  It didn't come from Europe.
[1:29:13.060 --> 1:29:13.980]  I mean, if it came from Europe,
[1:29:13.980 --> 1:29:16.460]  you called the German virus wherever it first was found.
[1:29:16.460 --> 1:29:17.380]  That's what you call things.
[1:29:17.380 --> 1:29:19.860]  It's like Rocky Mountain spotted tick fever.
[1:29:19.860 --> 1:29:24.860]  Kind of how the Rocky Mountains or Spanish flu
[1:29:24.860 --> 1:29:26.020]  first showed up in Spain.
[1:29:27.660 --> 1:29:29.300]  The black plague's called black plague
[1:29:29.300 --> 1:29:31.260]  because it makes black spots on your skin.
[1:29:31.260 --> 1:29:35.260]  I mean, yellow fever makes your skin turn yellow.
[1:29:36.700 --> 1:29:38.500]  But they turn that into this
[1:29:39.460 --> 1:29:41.780]  because they don't want where it came from discussed
[1:29:41.780 --> 1:29:43.740]  as it came out of a bio weapons lab,
[1:29:43.740 --> 1:29:46.220]  run by Fauci and Bill and Linda Gates.
[1:29:46.220 --> 1:29:47.140]  And that's now in the news.
[1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:49.220]  But ahead of our special guests
[1:29:50.300 --> 1:29:52.860]  on the next big hoax, the globalist may run
[1:29:52.860 --> 1:29:55.020]  a fake UN invasion project, Bluebeam,
[1:29:55.020 --> 1:29:56.900]  which is real, declassified.
[1:29:58.540 --> 1:29:59.940]  Let's go ahead and go to this compilation
[1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:03.020]  of some of the nastier things Bill Gates has said recently.
[1:30:04.860 --> 1:30:08.140]  The issue that really grabbed me as urgent
[1:30:09.420 --> 1:30:12.060]  was were issues related to population.
[1:30:12.060 --> 1:30:14.580]  Issues related to population.
[1:30:14.580 --> 1:30:18.100]  In 1998, Dr. Xaven became the founding director
[1:30:18.100 --> 1:30:20.100]  of the Bill and Linda Gates Institute
[1:30:20.100 --> 1:30:21.780]  for Population Control.
[1:30:21.780 --> 1:30:24.300]  Dr. Xaven became the founding director
[1:30:24.300 --> 1:30:26.820]  of the Bill and Linda Gates Institute
[1:30:26.820 --> 1:30:28.940]  for Population Control.
[1:30:28.940 --> 1:30:32.460]  We see a lot of things that are going very well.
[1:30:32.460 --> 1:30:34.780]  Things like producing child to death and.
[1:30:36.180 --> 1:30:38.580]  Things like producing child to death
[1:30:38.580 --> 1:30:43.580]  and things like producing child to death and.
[1:30:45.140 --> 1:30:47.340]  First, we've got population.
[1:30:47.340 --> 1:30:50.140]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:52.380]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:54.420]  Now, if we do a really great job
[1:30:54.420 --> 1:30:57.580]  on new vaccines, healthcare,
[1:30:57.580 --> 1:30:58.900]  reproductive health services,
[1:30:58.900 --> 1:31:02.220]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:04.820]  Now, if we do a really great job
[1:31:04.820 --> 1:31:08.740]  on new vaccines, healthcare,
[1:31:08.740 --> 1:31:10.380]  reproductive health services,
[1:31:10.380 --> 1:31:14.060]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[1:31:14.060 --> 1:31:15.500]  Is spending a million dollars
[1:31:15.500 --> 1:31:18.500]  on that last three months of life for that patient,
[1:31:18.500 --> 1:31:22.780]  would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers
[1:31:22.780 --> 1:31:25.700]  and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[1:31:25.700 --> 1:31:28.220]  But that's called the death panel.
[1:31:28.220 --> 1:31:30.180]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[1:31:30.180 --> 1:31:32.580]  But that's called the death panel.
[1:31:32.580 --> 1:31:34.300]  By the way, hit pause.
[1:31:34.300 --> 1:31:36.860]  See, it's called ambient warfare or soft kill.
[1:31:36.860 --> 1:31:38.820]  They have penning on papers on this.
[1:31:40.180 --> 1:31:41.660]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[1:31:41.660 --> 1:31:43.220]  Colonel Alexander and others have written about it,
[1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:44.460]  but they didn't invent it.
[1:31:45.340 --> 1:31:46.660]  You want to kill somebody,
[1:31:46.660 --> 1:31:48.860]  but have them wander off and not know it killed them
[1:31:48.860 --> 1:31:50.260]  so you don't get to blame.
[1:31:51.500 --> 1:31:53.660]  You want to weigh down society with the weapon.
[1:31:53.660 --> 1:31:57.180]  So see, that's what they're doing.
[1:31:58.060 --> 1:31:59.860]  And you can argue, hey, there's too many people,
[1:31:59.860 --> 1:32:00.700]  let's do this.
[1:32:00.700 --> 1:32:03.060]  But the point is, is they're targeting you.
[1:32:03.060 --> 1:32:05.300]  All these delusional yuppies and people think,
[1:32:05.300 --> 1:32:08.020]  oh, we're just going to kill off Africa and Latin America.
[1:32:08.020 --> 1:32:09.900]  No, they're going to kill you off too.
[1:32:10.980 --> 1:32:12.580]  So I just say to all the leftists,
[1:32:12.580 --> 1:32:14.460]  hey, there's too many people, kill yourselves.
[1:32:14.460 --> 1:32:16.940]  I mean, I don't want you to die, but I'm saying.
[1:32:19.660 --> 1:32:21.300]  Before I die, my family dies.
[1:32:21.300 --> 1:32:23.300]  And before we wipe out a bunch of poor people,
[1:32:23.300 --> 1:32:25.700]  how about you belly up to the bar first champ?
[1:32:25.700 --> 1:32:27.380]  And I'll have a little respect for you
[1:32:27.380 --> 1:32:30.020]  when leftists start throwing themselves off buildings
[1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:31.980]  and blowing their heads off and taking pills
[1:32:31.980 --> 1:32:34.460]  or drowning, you know, burn yourself,
[1:32:34.460 --> 1:32:36.740]  pour gasoline on yourself, light your ass on fire,
[1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:39.580]  show us what we're supposed to say.
[1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:41.020]  I'm here, there's too many people.
[1:32:41.020 --> 1:32:44.300]  My name is Bob Smith, pour gasoline on yourself.
[1:32:44.300 --> 1:32:46.260]  And I'm like, whoa, I respect this.
[1:32:46.260 --> 1:32:49.100]  Like I'm Bill Gates, there's too many people.
[1:32:49.100 --> 1:32:51.100]  You know, when I see that, then I'll go,
[1:32:51.100 --> 1:32:53.860]  oh, well, you're really committed, you walk the walk,
[1:32:53.860 --> 1:32:55.660]  man, you don't just talk the talk.
[1:32:56.780 --> 1:33:01.020]  You're hardcore, but you never do that, do you?
[1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:03.860]  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah.
[1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:06.860]  Ah, ha, ha, ha, we're supposed to go first.
[1:33:06.860 --> 1:33:10.020]  No Gates, you go first.
[1:33:11.180 --> 1:33:13.500]  Because there's a thousand worlds waiting for us right now,
[1:33:13.500 --> 1:33:15.260]  there's plenty of room.
[1:33:15.260 --> 1:33:17.140]  And you're not God, sunny boy.
[1:33:17.140 --> 1:33:22.140]  You're not God, you understand me, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:33:23.340 --> 1:33:26.260]  Don't even pretend you are, sunny boy.
[1:33:26.260 --> 1:33:28.540]  Let's finish up with this enemy.
[1:33:28.540 --> 1:33:32.780]  Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers
[1:33:32.780 --> 1:33:35.740]  and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:38.220]  But that's called the death panel.
[1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:40.180]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[1:33:40.180 --> 1:33:42.460]  But that's called the death panel.
[1:33:43.340 --> 1:33:45.820]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[1:33:45.820 --> 1:33:49.860]  Today, the greatest risk of global catastrophe
[1:33:49.860 --> 1:33:51.380]  doesn't look like this.
[1:33:52.260 --> 1:33:54.540]  Instead, it looks like this.
[1:33:56.380 --> 1:34:00.100]  If anything kills over 10 million people
[1:34:00.100 --> 1:34:01.260]  in the next few decades.
[1:34:01.260 --> 1:34:02.100]  Happens to be the coronavirus.
[1:34:02.100 --> 1:34:05.500]  It's most likely to be a highly infectious virus
[1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:06.860]  rather than a war.
[1:34:06.860 --> 1:34:07.700]  Oh.
[1:34:07.700 --> 1:34:12.020]  If anything kills over 10 million people
[1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:15.900]  in the next few decades, it's most likely
[1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:18.100]  to be a highly infectious virus.
[1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:19.940]  And he teaches you what's gonna kill you.
[1:34:19.940 --> 1:34:20.780]  So he's the same.
[1:34:20.780 --> 1:34:23.260]  And see how we can get this down to zero.
[1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:24.260]  Oh, some of my stabbing.
[1:34:24.260 --> 1:34:25.460]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:27.820]  Gonna have to get pretty near to zero.
[1:34:27.820 --> 1:34:29.140]  He'll get some of my stabbing.
[1:34:29.140 --> 1:34:30.820]  He's stabbing you like you're so smart.
[1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:32.020]  How'd you know?
[1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:33.620]  Probably one of these numbers
[1:34:33.620 --> 1:34:36.580]  is gonna have to get pretty near to zero.
[1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:39.860]  Now, malaria is, of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[1:34:39.860 --> 1:34:41.700]  I brought some here.
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:43.980]  So you could experience this.
[1:34:43.980 --> 1:34:46.340]  We'll let those roam around the...
[1:34:46.340 --> 1:34:49.060]  See, this iconic does it to you.
[1:34:50.340 --> 1:34:52.620]  I brought some here.
[1:34:52.620 --> 1:34:55.500]  So you could experience this.
[1:34:55.500 --> 1:35:00.500]  We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
[1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:05.900]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[1:35:05.900 --> 1:35:06.740]  Oh, don't worry.
[1:35:06.740 --> 1:35:08.060]  You're all gonna have it now.
[1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:08.900]  Ha, ha, ha.
[1:35:08.900 --> 1:35:13.540]  Did you come to reproductive issues as an intellectual?
[1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:14.380]  When I was growing up,
[1:35:14.380 --> 1:35:19.380]  my parents were always involved in various volunteer things.
[1:35:19.580 --> 1:35:22.500]  My dad was head of Planned Parenthood.
[1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:27.500]  And it was very controversial to be involved with that.
[1:35:28.300 --> 1:35:31.500]  My dad was head of Planned Parenthood.
[1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:32.780]  The ultimate solution,
[1:35:32.780 --> 1:35:35.420]  the only thing that really lets us go back
[1:35:35.420 --> 1:35:38.060]  completely to normal and feel good
[1:35:38.060 --> 1:35:38.900]  about sitting in a state...
[1:35:38.900 --> 1:35:39.720]  By the way, Planned Parenthood,
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:41.020]  literally thought of Hitler.
[1:35:41.020 --> 1:35:43.180]  Is to create a vaccine
[1:35:43.180 --> 1:35:45.220]  and not just take care of our country,
[1:35:45.220 --> 1:35:50.220]  but take that vaccine out to the global population.
[1:35:50.420 --> 1:35:55.420]  Take that vaccine out to the global population.
[1:35:55.460 --> 1:35:59.660]  We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range
[1:35:59.660 --> 1:36:02.820]  because they're most at risk of that.
[1:36:02.820 --> 1:36:05.580]  And doing that so that you amp it up
[1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:06.940]  so it works in older people.
[1:36:06.940 --> 1:36:09.460]  And yet, you don't have side effects.
[1:36:09.460 --> 1:36:11.220]  But Jack Mesovic...
[1:36:11.220 --> 1:36:12.940]  One in 10,000...
[1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:14.620]  He told me Bill Gates loves me.
[1:36:14.620 --> 1:36:19.620]  That's way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.
[1:36:21.380 --> 1:36:23.100]  Folks, I apologize to Jack Mesovic.
[1:36:23.100 --> 1:36:24.220]  He's right.
[1:36:24.220 --> 1:36:25.460]  Bill Gates loves me.
[1:36:26.540 --> 1:36:29.300]  And you should all take his shots.
[1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:32.860]  But we should kill a third world too.
[1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:35.860]  Jack Mesovic actually taught me how to love Bill Gates.
[1:36:35.860 --> 1:36:37.860]  Bill Gates, I'm sorry and I love you.
[1:36:39.860 --> 1:36:42.860]  Thanks for getting rid of all those black people, Bill.
[1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:45.860]  Thank you, Jack Mesovic.
[1:36:47.860 --> 1:36:50.860]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization
[1:36:50.860 --> 1:36:53.860]  to build up the world economy to where it is.
[1:36:53.860 --> 1:36:56.860]  Every economist is on record saying that
[1:36:56.860 --> 1:36:59.860]  as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[1:36:59.860 --> 1:37:01.860]  it is gonna be a death sentence to the third world
[1:37:01.860 --> 1:37:05.860]  and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world
[1:37:05.860 --> 1:37:08.860]  and that the general public is gonna go into deep, deep debt
[1:37:08.860 --> 1:37:11.860]  to the mega banks, but now I'm gonna have medical ID cards,
[1:37:11.860 --> 1:37:16.860]  forced inoculations, we are now in a giant dystopia.
[1:37:16.860 --> 1:37:18.860]  But a lot of people are waking up
[1:37:18.860 --> 1:37:23.860]  and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny
[1:37:23.860 --> 1:37:25.860]  and we must all rediscover our bill of rights,
[1:37:25.860 --> 1:37:28.860]  rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[1:37:28.860 --> 1:37:32.860]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground
[1:37:32.860 --> 1:37:35.860]  and say shut your business down, shut your life down,
[1:37:35.860 --> 1:37:36.860]  it'll save lives.
[1:37:36.860 --> 1:37:39.860]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death,
[1:37:39.860 --> 1:37:40.860]  tens of millions more.
[1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:43.860]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtues signaling
[1:37:43.860 --> 1:37:45.860]  you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[1:37:45.860 --> 1:37:47.860]  Congratulations.
[1:37:48.860 --> 1:37:52.860]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left
[1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:54.860]  in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[1:37:54.860 --> 1:37:57.860]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now
[1:37:57.860 --> 1:38:01.860]  in May until our Christmas sale comes up.
[1:38:01.860 --> 1:38:06.860]  All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off
[1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:08.860]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:38:08.860 --> 1:38:10.860]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:15.860]  DNA Force Plus, it's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10
[1:38:15.860 --> 1:38:17.860]  and a bunch of other natural ingredients
[1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:19.860]  that are known to supercharge the effects of that.
[1:38:19.860 --> 1:38:23.860]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you
[1:38:23.860 --> 1:38:26.860]  no matter how old you are, no matter what color you are,
[1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:28.860]  no matter where you live in the world,
[1:38:28.860 --> 1:38:30.860]  it works the same on everybody.
[1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:33.860]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[1:38:33.860 --> 1:38:36.860]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer,
[1:38:36.860 --> 1:38:39.860]  doesn't make them grow, makes them shrink slower,
[1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:41.860]  which is basically the same thing.
[1:38:41.860 --> 1:38:44.860]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time
[1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:56.860]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:15.860 --> 1:39:18.860]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world,
[1:39:18.860 --> 1:39:21.860]  not the establishment of talking points that are put out
[1:39:21.860 --> 1:39:23.860]  by the Council on Fine Relations, the Bilderberg Group,
[1:39:23.860 --> 1:39:26.860]  the Davos Group and other club lists.
[1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:30.860]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet
[1:39:30.860 --> 1:39:34.860]  and beyond based on humans, poor humans, bi-humans.
[1:39:34.860 --> 1:39:37.860]  Not a world where the establishment, hate themselves,
[1:39:37.860 --> 1:39:39.860]  project their hate onto us and decide
[1:39:39.860 --> 1:39:41.860]  we're going to have a post-human world.
[1:39:41.860 --> 1:39:44.860]  I'm really excited to know that InfoWars has your support
[1:39:44.860 --> 1:39:48.860]  and I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-guide.
[1:39:48.860 --> 1:39:51.860]  It's Tuesday morning as I record this important announcement
[1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:54.860]  at my kitchen table to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[1:39:54.860 --> 1:39:57.860]  We're running the biggest sale we've had yet of the year.

[1:41:14.860 --> 1:41:16.860]  we're going to go to him in this segment,
[1:41:16.860 --> 1:41:19.860]  Dr. Steven Greer, who doesn't eat any introduction
[1:41:19.860 --> 1:41:22.860]  from documentaries, TV shows, films,
[1:41:22.860 --> 1:41:24.860]  Coast to Coast AM, Art Bell, George Norrie,
[1:41:24.860 --> 1:41:26.860]  doesn't eat any introduction.
[1:41:26.860 --> 1:41:29.860]  Medical doctor that worked in secret black projects.
[1:41:29.860 --> 1:41:32.860]  He's on the show. He's got the number one documentary
[1:41:32.860 --> 1:41:34.860]  right now on all platforms.
[1:41:34.860 --> 1:41:36.860]  Close encounters of the fifth kind.
[1:41:36.860 --> 1:41:38.860]  We'll talk to him in a moment.
[1:41:38.860 --> 1:41:40.860]  Let me just throw this out because in the real world,
[1:41:40.860 --> 1:41:42.860]  we sell products. We sell books, films,
[1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:44.860]  t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration.
[1:41:44.860 --> 1:41:47.860]  Good products. That's how we built our own independent system.
[1:41:47.860 --> 1:41:49.860]  And the establishment is trying to shut us down.
[1:41:49.860 --> 1:41:52.860]  You know that. But these are great products to begin with.
[1:41:52.860 --> 1:41:55.860]  So it's a win-win for you and keep the show on the air.
[1:41:55.860 --> 1:41:59.860]  We have six days left. The biggest sale yet this year.
[1:41:59.860 --> 1:42:02.860]  We will have a sale this big in November, early December.
[1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:04.860]  Our Christmas sale will be this big.
[1:42:04.860 --> 1:42:06.860]  But this is the biggest sale in the world.
[1:42:06.860 --> 1:42:11.860]  Our Christmas sale will be this big. But this is the biggest sale yet this year.
[1:42:11.860 --> 1:42:14.860]  30 to 60% off on all of our high-quality products.
[1:42:14.860 --> 1:42:17.860]  And some of these products, like 8-pack PowerStack,
[1:42:17.860 --> 1:42:20.860]  that's amazing. We make like $10 on it at this price.
[1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:22.860]  So we're selling this at cost.
[1:42:22.860 --> 1:42:25.860]  And a lot of that's because we overordered some at the end of the year
[1:42:25.860 --> 1:42:28.860]  last year and have a little bit of excess product.
[1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:31.860]  So m4store.com. Ultimate Creole Oil is so good for you.
[1:42:31.860 --> 1:42:34.860]  It's the highest-grade Creole Oil. That's 50% off.
[1:42:34.860 --> 1:42:37.860]  Survival Sildex too, back in stock, 50% off.
[1:42:37.860 --> 1:42:39.860]  It's all there at m4store.com.
[1:42:39.860 --> 1:42:42.860]  DNA Force Plus, back in stock, 50% off.
[1:42:42.860 --> 1:42:44.860]  So please support us.
[1:42:44.860 --> 1:42:49.860]  Now, I've been listening to Dr. Stephen Greer for 20 years.
[1:42:49.860 --> 1:42:52.860]  And I've read a couple of his books and I followed what he has to say.
[1:42:52.860 --> 1:42:55.860]  And I never got into UFOs and all of this
[1:42:55.860 --> 1:42:58.860]  because I knew a lot of it was real.
[1:42:58.860 --> 1:43:00.860]  But I couldn't get people to admit there were FEMA camps
[1:43:00.860 --> 1:43:04.860]  and shadow government, the CFR and all of this.
[1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:08.860]  But the public now is ready for this.
[1:43:08.860 --> 1:43:10.860]  And so he'll be with us the whole next hour
[1:43:10.860 --> 1:43:13.860]  and hopefully come back again for a couple of hours next week.
[1:43:13.860 --> 1:43:16.860]  And so he's on with us, Dr. Stephen Greer.com.
[1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:20.860]  And he wants to get into his new film and what's happening with COVID-19
[1:43:20.860 --> 1:43:23.860]  and so much as a medical doctor here today.
[1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:26.860]  But I wanted to air something from many years ago
[1:43:26.860 --> 1:43:32.860]  and a film he was involved in dealing with the fake alien invasion
[1:43:32.860 --> 1:43:35.860]  because Project Bluebeam has been partially declassified.
[1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:39.860]  They admit that a fake alien invasion in holograms in the sky
[1:43:39.860 --> 1:43:42.860]  is something the CIA and Pentagon really looked at.
[1:43:42.860 --> 1:43:45.860]  And so let's go ahead and start before we introduce him
[1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:49.860]  with a few minutes from that film where he broke this down.
[1:43:49.860 --> 1:43:53.860]  November 12th of 1988 was their dog and pony show
[1:43:53.860 --> 1:43:57.860]  a classified military exhibit at Norton Air Force Base.
[1:43:57.860 --> 1:44:00.860]  And then off in a separate section of the hangar behind a curtain
[1:44:00.860 --> 1:44:02.860]  which was opened up once everyone had gathered
[1:44:02.860 --> 1:44:06.860]  were three of these so-called alien reproduction vehicles, or ARVs.
[1:44:06.860 --> 1:44:09.860]  The craft itself was hovering off the floor
[1:44:09.860 --> 1:44:12.860]  with no landing gear underneath it, nothing supporting it from above.
[1:44:12.860 --> 1:44:16.860]  To see something travel across 12 miles of airspace
[1:44:16.860 --> 1:44:18.860]  in under a second and a half,
[1:44:18.860 --> 1:44:20.860]  make a couple of right angle turns
[1:44:20.860 --> 1:44:25.860]  and not make a supersonic shockwave of any kind, no sonic boom,
[1:44:25.860 --> 1:44:27.860]  which I've personally witnessed on a number of occasions.
[1:44:27.860 --> 1:44:30.860]  I mean, it's just, it changes your whole perspective.
[1:44:30.860 --> 1:44:34.860]  There are people who've had experiences with the technology
[1:44:34.860 --> 1:44:37.860]  that were not able to handle it psychologically
[1:44:37.860 --> 1:44:40.860]  because it just defies reality.
[1:44:40.860 --> 1:44:44.860]  And in this document, the CIA director, Walter Smith,
[1:44:44.860 --> 1:44:48.860]  says, I am today transmitting to the National Security Council
[1:44:48.860 --> 1:44:51.860]  a proposal in which it is concluded
[1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:54.860]  that the problems connected with unidentified flying objects
[1:44:54.860 --> 1:44:58.860]  appear to have implications for psychological warfare
[1:44:58.860 --> 1:45:01.860]  as well as for intelligence and operations.
[1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:04.860]  To have to take a step back from all the jargon
[1:45:04.860 --> 1:45:08.860]  and all the paranoia in Star Wars movies for just a minute
[1:45:08.860 --> 1:45:15.860]  and realize that it's very easy to set up a false flag operation.
[1:45:15.860 --> 1:45:20.860]  A false flag operation, also known as a false indication
[1:45:20.860 --> 1:45:24.860]  and warning, is a military tactic
[1:45:24.860 --> 1:45:27.860]  in which you create the illusion of a threat,
[1:45:27.860 --> 1:45:32.860]  often by attacking yourself and blaming the desired enemy.
[1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:34.860]  It's proven extremely effective
[1:45:34.860 --> 1:45:39.860]  at uniting the public around a perceived threat.
[1:45:39.860 --> 1:45:43.860]  Have you been exposed or did you come across
[1:45:43.860 --> 1:45:46.860]  in your career and your network
[1:45:46.860 --> 1:45:50.860]  the false I&W or the deceptive indication
[1:45:50.860 --> 1:45:54.860]  and warnings projects related to this?
[1:45:54.860 --> 1:45:55.860]  Yes.
[1:45:55.860 --> 1:45:58.860]  They could pull it off. They could definitely pull it off.
[1:45:58.860 --> 1:46:00.860]  Right now, they have the technology
[1:46:00.860 --> 1:46:05.860]  to mimic the form fit in function of extraterrestrial UFOs.
[1:46:05.860 --> 1:46:07.860]  They have the technology. Absolutely.
[1:46:07.860 --> 1:46:09.860]  It's seamless and you could never know the difference.
[1:46:09.860 --> 1:46:12.860]  So if they wanted to hoax an alien invasion,
[1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:14.860]  they could do it and they could do it in a way
[1:46:14.860 --> 1:46:16.860]  that's 100% believable.
[1:46:16.860 --> 1:46:21.860]  They started doing all kinds of psychological warfare
[1:46:21.860 --> 1:46:26.860]  entrainment of the public by staging hoaxed events
[1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:28.860]  such as cattle mutilations.
[1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:30.860]  Oh, it's a flying saucer who did that.
[1:46:30.860 --> 1:46:33.860]  It's a covert paramilitary program, human.
[1:46:33.860 --> 1:46:36.860]  So if you wanted to start indoctrinating people
[1:46:36.860 --> 1:46:39.860]  into a false threat from outer space
[1:46:39.860 --> 1:46:41.860]  that Werner von Braun warned us about,
[1:46:41.860 --> 1:46:46.860]  you would start staging events that look alien
[1:46:46.860 --> 1:46:50.860]  but that are completely man-made, that are scary
[1:46:50.860 --> 1:46:52.860]  and scare the hell out of people.
[1:46:52.860 --> 1:46:56.860]  In our stage left, you got these sort of anti-gravity devices
[1:46:56.860 --> 1:46:59.860]  with creatures that look like ETs
[1:46:59.860 --> 1:47:01.860]  that are actually man-made robotic systems.
[1:47:01.860 --> 1:47:04.860]  That's from unacknowledged 2017, three years ago
[1:47:04.860 --> 1:47:07.860]  and now it's on Fox News or showing cockpit footage.
[1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:10.860]  I remember like eight years ago, I was in Montana
[1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:12.860]  sitting out there at night, clear sky,
[1:47:12.860 --> 1:47:14.860]  and these are up at satellite level
[1:47:14.860 --> 1:47:17.860]  and they're doing 180-degree turns
[1:47:17.860 --> 1:47:18.860]  at thousands of miles an hour.
[1:47:18.860 --> 1:47:20.860]  So we know this is going on.
[1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:22.860]  The question is, what's the bigger agenda?
[1:47:22.860 --> 1:47:23.860]  Dr. Stephen Greer is here with us.
[1:47:23.860 --> 1:47:25.860]  He has courage coming on the show
[1:47:25.860 --> 1:47:27.860]  because obviously anybody that comes on is demonized.
[1:47:27.860 --> 1:47:28.860]  Dr. Stephen Greer.com.
[1:47:28.860 --> 1:47:29.860]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[1:47:29.860 --> 1:47:31.860]  We're going to break in about four minutes.
[1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:33.860]  I wanted to air that before we get to the next trailer
[1:47:33.860 --> 1:47:36.860]  for your film that's number one across all platforms.
[1:47:36.860 --> 1:47:38.860]  Close encounters of the fifth kind.
[1:47:38.860 --> 1:47:39.860]  Congratulations.
[1:47:39.860 --> 1:47:41.860]  I know you particularly wanted to come on about COVID-19
[1:47:41.860 --> 1:47:43.860]  and just everything we're facing.
[1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:45.860]  So thanks for joining us, doctor.
[1:47:45.860 --> 1:47:46.860]  Happy to be here.
[1:47:46.860 --> 1:47:48.860]  Well, one of the things people need to understand,
[1:47:48.860 --> 1:47:53.860]  you know, there's a lot of discussion about the deep state
[1:47:53.860 --> 1:47:57.860]  in our society now and what people don't understand is
[1:47:57.860 --> 1:48:01.860]  what people are calling the deep state the proper term is
[1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:04.860]  an unacknowledged special access project.
[1:48:04.860 --> 1:48:08.860]  Now, I've dealt with these since for the last 30 years
[1:48:08.860 --> 1:48:11.860]  and as many of your listeners may know,
[1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:14.860]  like I'm an emergency doctor, got dragged into this
[1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:17.860]  through a number of things we don't have time to go into
[1:48:17.860 --> 1:48:21.860]  and began to brief people like the director of the CIA,
[1:48:21.860 --> 1:48:23.860]  the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
[1:48:23.860 --> 1:48:26.860]  members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on this problem.
[1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:31.860]  And what I discovered very quickly is that there's an illegal,
[1:48:31.860 --> 1:48:36.860]  outrageous, unconstitutional and frankly criminal aspect
[1:48:36.860 --> 1:48:40.860]  of government and corporations that are running these projects
[1:48:40.860 --> 1:48:43.860]  without the supervision and approval of the president
[1:48:43.860 --> 1:48:45.860]  or the Congress or of we the people.
[1:48:45.860 --> 1:48:49.860]  You're talking about a breakaway rogue civilization.
[1:48:49.860 --> 1:48:55.860]  Well, it's a breakaway rogue, very tightly controlled operation
[1:48:55.860 --> 1:48:58.860]  that doesn't fit the normal stereotypes of what most people
[1:48:58.860 --> 1:49:02.860]  think of in terms of this kind of operation.
[1:49:02.860 --> 1:49:05.860]  In other words, I would say that out of a thousand people,
[1:49:05.860 --> 1:49:09.860]  even in the military, if you were to go to them and say,
[1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:11.860]  there are operations dealing with UFOs
[1:49:11.860 --> 1:49:14.860]  that are so tightly compartmented that your boss,
[1:49:14.860 --> 1:49:17.860]  who is a four-star general, is denied access to them,
[1:49:17.860 --> 1:49:19.860]  they would think that you'd lost your mind.
[1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:21.860]  But that's what we discovered.
[1:49:21.860 --> 1:49:26.860]  And now I have about 985 whistleblowers,
[1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:30.860]  top secret, corporate and CIA and Pentagon folks on my team
[1:49:30.860 --> 1:49:33.860]  who are providing us with information and documents about this.
[1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:35.860]  No, I agree with you.
[1:49:35.860 --> 1:49:38.860]  I know you're not defending Trump or pro-Trump,
[1:49:38.860 --> 1:49:40.860]  but is it from what I've seen,
[1:49:40.860 --> 1:49:42.860]  Trump's trying to decompartmentalize that,
[1:49:42.860 --> 1:49:44.860]  at least on the surface, it looks like that.
[1:49:44.860 --> 1:49:47.860]  Yes, well, here's the problem with the presidency.
[1:49:47.860 --> 1:49:50.860]  I've done a briefing together for every president since Clinton
[1:49:50.860 --> 1:49:52.860]  when I was a young medical doctor.
[1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:56.860]  And what I have found is that a bubble gets put around them
[1:49:56.860 --> 1:49:59.860]  by the National Security Act.
[1:49:59.860 --> 1:50:00.860]  Exactly.
[1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:02.860]  And they deceive the president
[1:50:02.860 --> 1:50:04.860]  and then they manipulate them.
[1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:07.860]  I mean, here's a quick course in this for your listeners.
[1:50:07.860 --> 1:50:10.860]  George W. Bush had 9-11,
[1:50:10.860 --> 1:50:14.860]  which was completely a contrived situation,
[1:50:14.860 --> 1:50:18.860]  and that caused his presidency to go off the rails
[1:50:18.860 --> 1:50:20.860]  and we invaded Iraq.
[1:50:20.860 --> 1:50:23.860]  So they always create a crisis to take control of the presidency.
[1:50:23.860 --> 1:50:24.860]  Correct.
[1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:27.860]  And then the next one, of course, was the financial crisis.
[1:50:27.860 --> 1:50:30.860]  The gang banksters, the big banking people,
[1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:32.860]  were gunned to Obama's head.
[1:50:32.860 --> 1:50:33.860]  2008, 2009.
[1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:35.860]  Yeah, 2008, 9, 10.
[1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:39.860]  And then you say, print up trillions of dollars in fake money
[1:50:39.860 --> 1:50:40.860]  and bail out the big banks,
[1:50:40.860 --> 1:50:43.860]  meanwhile, average people whilst they're homes.
[1:50:43.860 --> 1:50:45.860]  Now we have the coronavirus,
[1:50:45.860 --> 1:50:48.860]  which is like the president has seen a ghost here,
[1:50:48.860 --> 1:50:49.860]  and they said,
[1:50:49.860 --> 1:50:52.860]  we're going to dump 2 million dead bodies on your doorstep
[1:50:52.860 --> 1:50:54.860]  if you don't do the following.
[1:50:54.860 --> 1:50:57.860]  And so a whole bunch of policies have gone out.
[1:50:57.860 --> 1:50:58.860]  But all of this,
[1:50:58.860 --> 1:51:00.860]  this is the key point I want to make.
[1:51:00.860 --> 1:51:04.860]  All of this is basically a breast rehearsal for what's coming,
[1:51:04.860 --> 1:51:07.860]  and people need to wake up.
[1:51:07.860 --> 1:51:08.860]  I agree with you.
[1:51:08.860 --> 1:51:10.860]  So you'll have the floor, sir.
[1:51:10.860 --> 1:51:13.860]  We'll have about 50 minutes of airtime when we come back with breaks
[1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:14.860]  and cut into that.
[1:51:14.860 --> 1:51:17.860]  Dr. Stephen Greer is our guest.
[1:51:17.860 --> 1:51:21.860]  And this is going to be one hell of a transmission straight ahead
[1:51:21.860 --> 1:51:24.860]  because whether you want to believe in UFOs or not,
[1:51:24.860 --> 1:51:29.860]  globalists believe they're getting off-world or interdimensional communications.
[1:51:29.860 --> 1:51:32.860]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:51:32.860 --> 1:51:34.860]  We'll be right back in T-minus two minutes.
[1:51:34.860 --> 1:51:55.860]  So everybody, you know, tune in now.
[1:52:04.860 --> 1:52:11.860]  We'll be right back in T-minus two minutes.
[1:52:35.860 --> 1:52:39.860]  We must break free from these monsters.
[1:52:39.860 --> 1:52:42.860]  This is the end, my friends.
[1:52:42.860 --> 1:52:44.860]  My only friends, the end.
[1:52:44.860 --> 1:52:46.860]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[1:52:46.860 --> 1:52:49.860]  Of everything that stands the end.
[1:52:49.860 --> 1:52:52.860]  The safety, the delusion.
[1:52:52.860 --> 1:52:54.860]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:52:54.860 --> 1:52:57.860]  because it was only the mirage of safety.
[1:52:57.860 --> 1:53:01.860]  Movies and partying and living like children,
[1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:04.860]  never growing up, never caring about other people.
[1:53:04.860 --> 1:53:08.860]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[1:53:08.860 --> 1:53:11.860]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states,
[1:53:11.860 --> 1:53:15.860]  every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God,
[1:53:15.860 --> 1:53:17.860]  they were brought into captivity
[1:53:17.860 --> 1:53:20.860]  because their people sold out to special interest
[1:53:20.860 --> 1:53:22.860]  and were infiltrated by spies,
[1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:24.860]  and then they were enslaved.
[1:53:24.860 --> 1:53:26.860]  We are repeating that again today.
[1:53:26.860 --> 1:53:31.860]  Clients and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[1:53:31.860 --> 1:53:34.860]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[1:53:34.860 --> 1:53:57.860]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[1:54:04.860 --> 1:54:11.860]  Well, the whole problem is that, you know,
[1:54:11.860 --> 1:54:16.860]  Bernadon Brown back in the 70s on his deathbed told a member of my team
[1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:21.860]  that there was a long-term agenda to hoax a threat from outer space
[1:54:21.860 --> 1:54:25.860]  so that sort of the uber, the U.S. military,
[1:54:25.860 --> 1:54:35.860]  who were really fascist, wanted to take over the planet and unite humanity,
[1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:40.860]  not in love and peace or spiritual development or anything nice,
[1:54:40.860 --> 1:54:46.860]  but around a fearsome sort of police state conditions
[1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:50.860]  and that they would go through a number of cases
[1:54:50.860 --> 1:54:55.860]  to do that. First, there would be, of course, the Cold War,
[1:54:55.860 --> 1:54:59.860]  which they would wind down, replace it with global terrorism
[1:54:59.860 --> 1:55:02.860]  and then global financial chaos.
[1:55:02.860 --> 1:55:06.860]  And then the big one, which is the one that they're working on most,
[1:55:06.860 --> 1:55:10.860]  that's been very covert in these unacknowledged special access projects,
[1:55:10.860 --> 1:55:13.860]  is this hoaxed alien threat.
[1:55:13.860 --> 1:55:16.860]  Now, I want to clarify the word,
[1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:20.860]  alien is a very poor choice of words, frankly.
[1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:24.860]  There's a number of things going on that are dumped into that category.
[1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:29.860]  There are extraterrestrial biological life forms that have bodies,
[1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:31.860]  spacecraft from other star systems.
[1:55:31.860 --> 1:55:35.860]  There are things from other dimensions that are not ET,
[1:55:35.860 --> 1:55:37.860]  but that present as alien.
[1:55:37.860 --> 1:55:42.860]  And then there's all the hoaxed stuff that your clip earlier was showing.
[1:55:42.860 --> 1:55:47.860]  We have a man whose Air Force Intelligence, also Special Investigations,
[1:55:47.860 --> 1:55:51.860]  who was on our show, and it's in this new film,
[1:55:51.860 --> 1:55:53.860]  Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind,
[1:55:53.860 --> 1:55:56.860]  where he absolutely states, without a question,
[1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:00.860]  that covert programs have hoaxed alien encounters,
[1:56:00.860 --> 1:56:03.860]  made to look like abductions and what have you,
[1:56:03.860 --> 1:56:06.860]  for their psychological warfare value,
[1:56:06.860 --> 1:56:08.860]  but also, which is interesting,
[1:56:08.860 --> 1:56:14.860]  to cover up other events that people have witnessed.
[1:56:14.860 --> 1:56:17.860]  For example, one of these was a person,
[1:56:17.860 --> 1:56:25.860]  a group of people who saw a classified anti-gravity, man-made human object
[1:56:25.860 --> 1:56:28.860]  that's like a small disk,
[1:56:28.860 --> 1:56:33.860]  lift off from a facility, an Air Force facility in Washington State.
[1:56:33.860 --> 1:56:36.860]  They should not have seen that.
[1:56:36.860 --> 1:56:40.860]  They sent out a team of people who abducted these poor innocent people
[1:56:40.860 --> 1:56:42.860]  and basically tortured them
[1:56:42.860 --> 1:56:46.860]  and gave them the whole full-on alien abduction experience.
[1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:50.860]  Now, this sounds like something like a bad example out of the X-Files.
[1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:54.860]  Sure, they're creating a backstory to cover up what's really going to make it fantastical,
[1:56:54.860 --> 1:56:55.860]  but we know that.
[1:56:55.860 --> 1:57:00.860]  They've used holograms and things to create fake UFOs
[1:57:00.860 --> 1:57:02.860]  to then cover up what's really going on.
[1:57:02.860 --> 1:57:05.860]  Yeah, and that's about 80% of what people see.
[1:57:05.860 --> 1:57:08.860]  Now, you know, the Pentagon last couple of weeks ago
[1:57:08.860 --> 1:57:15.860]  re-released the footage of the gun camera footage chasing a UFO off the coast of California.
[1:57:15.860 --> 1:57:18.860]  Well, we knew that was going to be released,
[1:57:18.860 --> 1:57:20.860]  and it was two and a half years ago initially,
[1:57:20.860 --> 1:57:25.860]  by a team of disinformation masters out of the Pentagon and CIA,
[1:57:25.860 --> 1:57:26.860]  and I know who they are.
[1:57:26.860 --> 1:57:28.860]  I've known them for 30 years.
[1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:31.860]  And the narrative that they attached to that footage,
[1:57:31.860 --> 1:57:33.860]  which is the key point here,
[1:57:33.860 --> 1:57:36.860]  is that it's a national security threat.
[1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:39.860]  They're invading our airspace, et cetera, and so on.
[1:57:39.860 --> 1:57:42.860]  Well, there's a very high likelihood that that particular footage
[1:57:42.860 --> 1:57:48.860]  was one of our Lockheed Martin Skunkworks highly classified aircraft
[1:57:48.860 --> 1:57:56.860]  that they put up and those brave guys chasing it in this Navy jet fighter.
[1:57:56.860 --> 1:57:58.860]  My dad was World War II Navy.
[1:57:58.860 --> 1:58:00.860]  Had no idea.
[1:58:00.860 --> 1:58:02.860]  It could have been one of ours.
[1:58:02.860 --> 1:58:04.860]  There it is. You're showing it now.
[1:58:04.860 --> 1:58:06.860]  So that footage, of course, went wide.
[1:58:06.860 --> 1:58:07.860]  It was on CNN.
[1:58:07.860 --> 1:58:10.860]  But you notice that there was a narrative attached to it.
[1:58:10.860 --> 1:58:14.860]  And this is the key part where it was presented multiple times
[1:58:14.860 --> 1:58:17.860]  as a national security threat.
[1:58:17.860 --> 1:58:21.860]  I think people better realize that if you think 9-11 was bad
[1:58:21.860 --> 1:58:24.860]  or the coronavirus situation is bad,
[1:58:24.860 --> 1:58:28.860]  what they're planning to do with this is an order of magnitude worse.
[1:58:28.860 --> 1:58:33.860]  You've been saying for 20-plus years that Project Bluebeam is the ultimate hoax,
[1:58:33.860 --> 1:58:34.860]  and now we're seeing it.
[1:58:34.860 --> 1:58:37.860]  We've been talking about viruses from Mars about to kill us.
[1:58:37.860 --> 1:58:41.860]  We'll cover when we come back in 60 seconds with Dr. Stephen Graham.
[1:58:46.860 --> 1:58:48.860]  Make a friend with death.
[1:58:48.860 --> 1:58:52.860]  It's a saying so old that no one knows who first said it.
[1:58:52.860 --> 1:58:57.860]  Every culture has their own way of memorializing that simple statement.
[1:58:57.860 --> 1:59:02.860]  But you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization
[1:59:02.860 --> 1:59:04.860]  and the death of the human species.
[1:59:04.860 --> 1:59:06.860]  The moment of truth is now here.
[1:59:06.860 --> 1:59:09.860]  We are facing the post-human era.
[1:59:09.860 --> 1:59:13.860]  And I've been warning you for many years that they would use a global viral crisis
[1:59:13.860 --> 1:59:18.860]  to click, put us in the cage, and then roll out the robot takeover.
[1:59:18.860 --> 1:59:21.860]  This is just the beta test.
[1:59:21.860 --> 1:59:25.860]  China is moving out of beta and into operational control.
[1:59:25.860 --> 1:59:30.860]  In just a few years, we will be under full globalist control,
[1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:32.860]  forced inoculations, total surveillance.
[1:59:32.860 --> 1:59:35.860]  We're all being taught that we are obsolete.
[1:59:35.860 --> 1:59:38.860]  The term they use is non-essential.
[1:59:38.860 --> 1:59:40.860]  This is not some dystopian novel.
[1:59:40.860 --> 1:59:42.860]  This is reality.
[1:59:42.860 --> 1:59:44.860]  This is the New World Order.
[1:59:44.860 --> 2:00:04.860]  This is Satanism.
[2:00:04.860 --> 2:00:13.860]  Dr. Stephen Greer, medical doctor, expert on off-world activities, brought up
[2:00:13.860 --> 2:00:17.860]  the fact that he presidents him bubbles using crises.
[2:00:17.860 --> 2:00:22.860]  And I remember three years ago getting death threats
[2:00:22.860 --> 2:00:25.860]  and other incredible things that happened.
[2:00:25.860 --> 2:00:27.860]  Offers of massive amounts of money, you name it.
[2:00:27.860 --> 2:00:31.860]  And they just said, listen, stop talking to Trump
[2:00:31.860 --> 2:00:34.860]  and stop telling him about the deep state.
[2:00:34.860 --> 2:00:36.860]  And I was like, okay, I'm a talk show host.
[2:00:36.860 --> 2:00:38.860]  I had Trump on some.
[2:00:38.860 --> 2:00:39.860]  I'm not that important.
[2:00:39.860 --> 2:00:42.860]  It's not that I was that important.
[2:00:42.860 --> 2:00:46.860]  Everyone else in the corporate and military world knew you don't talk to the president.
[2:00:46.860 --> 2:00:50.860]  You let the establishment do that.
[2:00:50.860 --> 2:00:52.860]  And so we can put the headlines up.
[2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:55.860]  Washington Post, media matters, all of it.
[2:00:55.860 --> 2:01:02.860]  General Kelly's main job was keeping Alex Jones away from President Trump.
[2:01:02.860 --> 2:01:06.860]  Because I'd say, sir, Fiona Hill, she's a Bilderberg group.
[2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:07.860]  She works for Soros.
[2:01:07.860 --> 2:01:10.860]  It's in 60 minutes last month that I did that.
[2:01:10.860 --> 2:01:14.860]  They're like, he called up the president and said Fiona Hill was a globalist.
[2:01:14.860 --> 2:01:17.860]  Hell, she runs the website globalist.com.
[2:01:17.860 --> 2:01:21.860]  But the point is, it's not that I'm powerful.
[2:01:21.860 --> 2:01:25.860]  It's that the imper is new clothes.
[2:01:25.860 --> 2:01:28.860]  No one will call it out because they come after you if you do.
[2:01:28.860 --> 2:01:30.860]  So Stephen Greer was bringing that up.
[2:01:30.860 --> 2:01:35.860]  Dr. Stephen Greer.com, medical doctor who worked in black projects.
[2:01:35.860 --> 2:01:37.860]  Please continue, sir, with what you're saying.
[2:01:37.860 --> 2:01:40.860]  If you think COVID's a big hoax, if you think all this is a big hoax,
[2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:43.860]  wait till the big hoax project blue beamed.
[2:01:43.860 --> 2:01:48.860]  Maybe you should tell us about what's admitted about secret government projects
[2:01:48.860 --> 2:01:52.860]  to hoax and alien invasion.
[2:01:52.860 --> 2:01:56.860]  Well, it involves a whole array of very sophisticated technologies
[2:01:56.860 --> 2:02:00.860]  where they could make people think that we're under some kind of attack
[2:02:00.860 --> 2:02:04.860]  that is actually being orchestrated by people trying to seize power,
[2:02:04.860 --> 2:02:07.860]  not just in the United States, but around the world.
[2:02:07.860 --> 2:02:12.860]  Remember, the name of the game is global power and control.
[2:02:12.860 --> 2:02:17.860]  And a lot of things that have happened over the last 20 years since 9-11
[2:02:17.860 --> 2:02:21.860]  have been a sort of beta testing of how the public would react.
[2:02:21.860 --> 2:02:26.860]  And also importantly, since your show is called InfraWars, how the media will.
[2:02:26.860 --> 2:02:30.860]  Now, you know, one of the people that we have on our new film,
[2:02:30.860 --> 2:02:34.860]  Closed Encounters of the Fifth Kind, is a man who worked with The New York Times
[2:02:34.860 --> 2:02:38.860]  on the Pentagon Papers who saw this Project Mockingbird document
[2:02:38.860 --> 2:02:43.860]  that listed 42 people who are major editors in the big mainstream media
[2:02:43.860 --> 2:02:46.860]  that were on the payroll of the CIA.
[2:02:46.860 --> 2:02:52.860]  Number one, that's illegal for the CIA to do that by law and its mandate
[2:02:52.860 --> 2:02:54.860]  to do anything domestic.
[2:02:54.860 --> 2:02:59.860]  But number two, it means that what people think they are getting in the media
[2:02:59.860 --> 2:03:02.860]  as sort of the pure truth is never the case.
[2:03:02.860 --> 2:03:08.860]  It's actually the scripted line, the party line, that these folks want you to hear.
[2:03:08.860 --> 2:03:10.860]  And that's become more clear now than ever.
[2:03:10.860 --> 2:03:13.860]  Yes, absolutely. It's completely clear.
[2:03:13.860 --> 2:03:16.860]  And anyone who says otherwise is, frankly, banned.
[2:03:16.860 --> 2:03:21.860]  So, you know, you mentioned, you know, being offered a lot of money years ago.
[2:03:21.860 --> 2:03:26.860]  People can't believe this, but in 1992, the head of Army Intelligence
[2:03:26.860 --> 2:03:32.860]  personally offered me $2 billion if I would shut up and not do what I was doing
[2:03:32.860 --> 2:03:34.860]  because I knew that we could make a lot of trouble.
[2:03:34.860 --> 2:03:38.860]  My uncle helped design the lunar module, put the first man on the moon,
[2:03:38.860 --> 2:03:40.860]  the Northrop Grumman.
[2:03:40.860 --> 2:03:44.860]  So, you know, we knew about a lot of projects and I had a lot of contacts
[2:03:44.860 --> 2:03:46.860]  with folks who had firsthand knowledge.
[2:03:46.860 --> 2:03:49.860]  You know, these weren't the UFO crazies.
[2:03:49.860 --> 2:03:53.860]  These were generals and aerospace engineers with Northrop Grumman,
[2:03:53.860 --> 2:03:56.860]  Lockheed Martin, CIA folks.
[2:03:56.860 --> 2:04:00.860]  And, you know, they were coming to me saying, look, you know, we have a huge problem here.
[2:04:00.860 --> 2:04:03.860]  And so they offered me $2 billion.
[2:04:03.860 --> 2:04:06.860]  And then he went behind my back to my wife, tried to convince her.
[2:04:06.860 --> 2:04:09.860]  And I finally said, look, I'm not for sale.
[2:04:09.860 --> 2:04:14.860]  And then here they come, every kind of defamation of my character.
[2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:16.860]  They literally put out that I wasn't a doctor.
[2:04:16.860 --> 2:04:22.860]  I had to send out to the public my license and literally my medical degree
[2:04:22.860 --> 2:04:26.860]  because people, henchmen for the deep state, as you call it,
[2:04:26.860 --> 2:04:29.860]  were going out there defaming me like that.
[2:04:29.860 --> 2:04:33.860]  So, you know, if your listeners think that this stuff doesn't happen,
[2:04:33.860 --> 2:04:36.860]  the people who blow the whistle on this level of criminal fraud.
[2:04:36.860 --> 2:04:37.860]  Yeah, I'm embarrassed.
[2:04:37.860 --> 2:04:39.860]  I was only offered $10 million.
[2:04:39.860 --> 2:04:40.860]  But I get it.
[2:04:40.860 --> 2:04:44.860]  They give engineers and people the chance to run projects as the point.
[2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:45.860]  Yes.
[2:04:45.860 --> 2:04:48.860]  You know, one of the members of this committee that deals with this,
[2:04:48.860 --> 2:04:52.860]  called the Majority Intelligence Committee, or MAGIC, that deals with this subject,
[2:04:52.860 --> 2:04:59.860]  MAJIC, told me in 1993, right before I briefed the CIA director,
[2:04:59.860 --> 2:05:04.860]  he said, look, we have given over 10,000 people at least $10 million
[2:05:04.860 --> 2:05:08.860]  and more in black budget money to secure their cooperation.
[2:05:08.860 --> 2:05:10.860]  You're talking about individually, huh?
[2:05:10.860 --> 2:05:12.860]  Yes.
[2:05:12.860 --> 2:05:13.860]  It's massive.
[2:05:13.860 --> 2:05:15.860]  People have no idea.
[2:05:15.860 --> 2:05:16.860]  Right.
[2:05:16.860 --> 2:05:19.860]  And so that's where you look at what they're capable of.
[2:05:19.860 --> 2:05:20.860]  Now, here's the other problem.
[2:05:20.860 --> 2:05:25.860]  Whatever you think these classified projects have in terms of technologies,
[2:05:25.860 --> 2:05:29.860]  you're probably thinking 20 generations ago.
[2:05:29.860 --> 2:05:34.860]  So, the technologies that exist are fearsome in terms of...
[2:05:34.860 --> 2:05:37.860]  Is that what creates the arrogance and...
[2:05:37.860 --> 2:05:39.860]  So, let's cut right to the chase.
[2:05:39.860 --> 2:05:41.860]  You get into whatever you want, Dr. Greer.
[2:05:41.860 --> 2:05:43.860]  Obviously, this is an anti-human agenda.
[2:05:43.860 --> 2:05:46.860]  They admit it's a post-human agenda now.
[2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:48.860]  They're externalizing the method.
[2:05:48.860 --> 2:05:51.860]  Silicon Valley obviously didn't just come up with this on their own.
[2:05:51.860 --> 2:05:55.860]  It's a very anti-human agenda.
[2:05:55.860 --> 2:05:56.860]  Who's behind it?
[2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:57.860]  Who are they?
[2:05:57.860 --> 2:05:58.860]  What is this?
[2:05:58.860 --> 2:06:04.860]  Well, there's a committee of folks, and everyone thinks it's...
[2:06:04.860 --> 2:06:07.860]  The word globalist can be used in a lot of ways.
[2:06:07.860 --> 2:06:09.860]  What it really is, it's transnational.
[2:06:09.860 --> 2:06:11.860]  So, let me define that for people.
[2:06:11.860 --> 2:06:13.860]  Everyone thinks of international.
[2:06:13.860 --> 2:06:14.860]  So, you have the U.S. border.
[2:06:14.860 --> 2:06:18.860]  You have Canada and Great Britain named Russia and China.
[2:06:18.860 --> 2:06:21.860]  That actually is the Truman Show.
[2:06:21.860 --> 2:06:24.860]  That's what they want people to think is operational.
[2:06:24.860 --> 2:06:30.860]  What's actually operational is a transnational elite that run these projects
[2:06:30.860 --> 2:06:35.860]  that they don't really give, frankly, a rat's ass, excuse my language,
[2:06:35.860 --> 2:06:38.860]  about whether it's American Chinese or anything else.
[2:06:38.860 --> 2:06:43.860]  They're only interested in the power and the concentration of enormous amounts of power
[2:06:43.860 --> 2:06:45.860]  and with that wealth.
[2:06:45.860 --> 2:06:52.860]  So, for example, we're still using fossil fuels and centralized electric grids
[2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:56.860]  when the technologies to replace that have been around for about 100 years.
[2:06:56.860 --> 2:07:00.860]  I'm going to give you a date that's going to curl your hair,
[2:07:00.860 --> 2:07:03.860]  and that is October 1954.
[2:07:03.860 --> 2:07:08.860]  That's the date, a man on my team who was the top scientist at the Naval Research Labs,
[2:07:08.860 --> 2:07:10.860]  the largest Department of Defense lab.
[2:07:10.860 --> 2:07:12.860]  His name is Rick Bush.
[2:07:12.860 --> 2:07:16.860]  He's passed away from prostate cancer, so I can mention his name.
[2:07:16.860 --> 2:07:23.860]  He was in the vault and saw a document that literally dated October 1954
[2:07:23.860 --> 2:07:28.860]  when we mastered gravity control, what the public would call anti-gravity.
[2:07:28.860 --> 2:07:35.860]  So, we have not needed a rocket or a jet aircraft since October 1954.
[2:07:35.860 --> 2:07:39.860]  I mean, my dad was just top of his class in plan two in high school already in college,
[2:07:39.860 --> 2:07:41.860]  and this was low-level stuff.
[2:07:41.860 --> 2:07:43.860]  He said they had CD-ROMs, computers.
[2:07:43.860 --> 2:07:44.860]  I was like a kid.
[2:07:44.860 --> 2:07:47.860]  He said, oh, they'll have these computers, and it'll call the Internet.
[2:07:47.860 --> 2:07:51.860]  And he wasn't even near anything that was an establishment.
[2:07:51.860 --> 2:07:52.860]  He was on the edge of it.
[2:07:52.860 --> 2:07:54.860]  They already had computers in the 60s.
[2:07:54.860 --> 2:08:00.860]  I mean, exactly, it's like he said, the future is not evenly distributed.
[2:08:00.860 --> 2:08:01.860]  That's right.
[2:08:01.860 --> 2:08:08.860]  And one of the problems is that we have a whole, multiple generations that have lived up in a society
[2:08:08.860 --> 2:08:11.860]  where we have been miseducated, diseducated.
[2:08:11.860 --> 2:08:16.860]  So, we're like the cavemen that they just give things when they want.
[2:08:16.860 --> 2:08:20.860]  They just give us little things with Trojan horses.
[2:08:20.860 --> 2:08:25.860]  And even the media, you know, above Schwartz, you may have heard that name, he was on the Board of Time Life.
[2:08:25.860 --> 2:08:27.860]  He became an AOL Time Warner.
[2:08:27.860 --> 2:08:32.860]  I was with him in New York in the 90s, and he says, you know, older gentlemen, he says, look, Dr. Greer,
[2:08:32.860 --> 2:08:40.860]  we the media have become basically scribes taking dictation at the right hand of the king,
[2:08:40.860 --> 2:08:46.860]  referring to these covert programs and large transnational corporations.
[2:08:46.860 --> 2:08:50.860]  And he says, you really can't report the truth on much of this.
[2:08:50.860 --> 2:08:54.860]  And he talked about how he was good friends with Mike Wallace at 60 Minutes,
[2:08:54.860 --> 2:09:01.860]  and had given him a document that listed some of the people involved in the UFO cover-up
[2:09:01.860 --> 2:09:06.860]  and these top secret programs that are unacknowledged special access projects,
[2:09:06.860 --> 2:09:09.860]  the super deep black ones that people refer to.
[2:09:09.860 --> 2:09:12.860]  And that's the proper name, is a USAP.
[2:09:12.860 --> 2:09:20.860]  And he said, basically, 60 Minutes executives told Mike Wallace, their star alleged investigative reporter,
[2:09:20.860 --> 2:09:22.860]  you can't do this story.
[2:09:22.860 --> 2:09:28.860]  Now, this was from the mouth of Mike Wallace's friend, Bob Schwartz, to my ears,
[2:09:28.860 --> 2:09:31.860]  and that man was on the Board of Time Life.
[2:09:31.860 --> 2:09:32.860]  No, I believe you.
[2:09:32.860 --> 2:09:36.860]  I remember growing up as a kid hearing about DMT and all the stuff that they were doing,
[2:09:36.860 --> 2:09:38.860]  and now it's all over the news with Joe Rogan.
[2:09:38.860 --> 2:09:40.860]  We'll be right back with Dr. Stephen Greer.
[2:09:40.860 --> 2:09:42.860]  I'll tell folks to do it right now.
[2:10:11.860 --> 2:10:15.860]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy
[2:10:15.860 --> 2:10:20.860]  and you're obsolete, so you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income
[2:10:20.860 --> 2:10:22.860]  so they can dictate your life.
[2:10:22.860 --> 2:10:24.860]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[2:10:24.860 --> 2:10:27.860]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order,
[2:10:27.860 --> 2:10:30.860]  and that takes you understanding you were right,
[2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:36.860]  and understanding I was right, and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[2:10:36.860 --> 2:10:38.860]  Now is the time for action.
[2:10:38.860 --> 2:10:42.860]  Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[2:11:08.860 --> 2:11:10.860]  Powerful, quiet, and effective,
[2:11:10.860 --> 2:11:15.860]  the Breeze uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[2:11:15.860 --> 2:11:19.860]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars,
[2:11:19.860 --> 2:11:24.860]  but the Eluxapure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[2:11:24.860 --> 2:11:28.860]  The Breeze and the Ion Cluster patented technology used in the system
[2:11:28.860 --> 2:11:32.860]  eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[2:11:32.860 --> 2:11:37.860]  Get the Eluxapure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[2:11:37.860 --> 2:11:40.860]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.
[2:11:40.860 --> 2:11:43.860]  Get this special today at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:11:47.860 --> 2:11:51.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:59.860 --> 2:12:02.860]  I'm Alex Jones. I am your host.
[2:12:02.860 --> 2:12:07.860]  Look at these articles that are on Infowars.com right now leaked study from inside German government warrants.
[2:12:07.860 --> 2:12:12.860]  Lockdown could kill more people than coronavirus.
[2:12:12.860 --> 2:12:18.860]  Fauci claims number of U.S. coronavirus tests actually higher than official toll.
[2:12:18.860 --> 2:12:23.860]  Test doubling down as it comes out there adding all the people that die of other stuff to the coronavirus number.
[2:12:23.860 --> 2:12:27.860]  He keeps boosting it because he works for the dark side.
[2:12:27.860 --> 2:12:32.860]  Washington State requires restaurants to collect personal info on diners or contact tracing.
[2:12:32.860 --> 2:12:35.860]  Just getting us ready for the control.
[2:12:35.860 --> 2:12:39.860]  Now, Dr. Stephen Greer is here with us.
[2:12:39.860 --> 2:12:43.860]  He's got a documentary that's number one across all major platforms right now.
[2:12:43.860 --> 2:12:45.860]  His website's drstevengreer.com.
[2:12:45.860 --> 2:12:48.860]  We'll get a next segment into his close encounters of the fifth kind.
[2:12:48.860 --> 2:12:53.860]  But as he said earlier, I just go off what I can prove.
[2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:57.860]  And I've not seen Papa Smurf. I've not seen a leprechaun.
[2:12:57.860 --> 2:13:01.860]  But I have gotten involved high level Hollywood and other things.
[2:13:01.860 --> 2:13:11.860]  And they really believe it's skull and bones in New Haven, Connecticut, or in some Hollywood event that they are interfacing with interdimensional beings that are giving them advanced knowledge.
[2:13:11.860 --> 2:13:23.860]  And you can roll your eyes at that until you realize that Thomas Malthus and Francis Gult and all these guys that envision modern science believe they got it from gods and goddesses.
[2:13:23.860 --> 2:13:26.860]  They believe from outside entities.
[2:13:26.860 --> 2:13:31.860]  So was that a way for them to have confidence to plumb their incredible mind or was it real?
[2:13:31.860 --> 2:13:33.860]  It doesn't matter because it's manifesting.
[2:13:33.860 --> 2:13:36.860]  So this is a short segment, long segment coming up with Dr. Greer.
[2:13:36.860 --> 2:13:38.860]  But you've got a lot to cover and I want you to have the floor here, sir.
[2:13:38.860 --> 2:13:41.860]  Let me just ask you from, you know, you are a medical doctor.
[2:13:41.860 --> 2:13:43.860]  You did work in black projects. That's not denied.
[2:13:43.860 --> 2:13:45.860]  I get a good feeling talking to you.
[2:13:45.860 --> 2:13:49.860]  You know, you come off as credible. I've been listening to you 20 years.
[2:13:49.860 --> 2:13:51.860]  And it feels like now is the time to expose this.
[2:13:51.860 --> 2:13:56.860]  But we are on a planet two thirds of the way out of the spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
[2:13:56.860 --> 2:13:59.860]  Obviously, we're not alone from your deep research.
[2:13:59.860 --> 2:14:02.860]  Who are the players versus the BS?
[2:14:02.860 --> 2:14:05.860]  Who gave us the advanced technology that crashed here?
[2:14:05.860 --> 2:14:10.860]  Obviously, Promethean fire on purpose. I mean, what's really going on?
[2:14:10.860 --> 2:14:22.860]  What's really going on is that the dominant narrative on the subject has to do with what you referred to as interdimensional beings as opposed to extraterrestrial beings.
[2:14:22.860 --> 2:14:24.860]  And those have been conflated and confused.
[2:14:24.860 --> 2:14:30.860]  For example, when I was, you know, I had a great discussion with Monsignor Balducci at the Vatican back in the 90s,
[2:14:30.860 --> 2:14:34.860]  who was the chief theologian and demonologist for Pope John Paul.
[2:14:34.860 --> 2:14:39.860]  And he says, look, angels, neither angels nor demons need flying saucers.
[2:14:39.860 --> 2:14:42.860]  It was a very succinct way of putting this.
[2:14:42.860 --> 2:14:49.860]  So what has happened is that, yes, there are people who have had experiences with things from other dimensions, other spirit worlds,
[2:14:49.860 --> 2:14:52.860]  other conscious entities from other dimensions.
[2:14:52.860 --> 2:15:02.860]  There are extraterrestrial life forms that people confuse with those because if you're going from one star system to another
[2:15:02.860 --> 2:15:10.860]  at multiples of the speed of light, which is the only way you can do it, you are crossing through those dimensions.
[2:15:10.860 --> 2:15:15.860]  So I use the term transdimensional interstellar civilizations.
[2:15:15.860 --> 2:15:19.860]  These are interstellar that have reached technological capabilities.
[2:15:19.860 --> 2:15:24.860]  But in order to go from point A to B, they're going through these other dimensions.
[2:15:24.860 --> 2:15:33.860]  But that's why there's an enormous amount of confusion, which the intelligence community and disinformation specialists have exploited.
[2:15:33.860 --> 2:15:34.860]  So people are-
[2:15:34.860 --> 2:15:38.860]  That's right. For folks that don't know, you don't need to travel a trillion miles.
[2:15:38.860 --> 2:15:43.860]  It's interdimensional fold space, which again the occult knows. Frank Herbert knew that.
[2:15:43.860 --> 2:15:48.860]  So from your deep research, where is the establishment getting the advanced technology?
[2:15:48.860 --> 2:15:52.860]  Is it transmitted through the ether or is it actually physically crashing?
[2:15:52.860 --> 2:16:03.860]  Well, they don't physically crash. You don't go through light years of space and then can't navigate an electrical storm in New Mexico.
[2:16:03.860 --> 2:16:07.860]  So everyone's heard of the famous, it's cliche Roswell event.
[2:16:07.860 --> 2:16:09.860]  That actually did happen.
[2:16:09.860 --> 2:16:16.860]  It was a early electromagnetic weapon that we had in a radar dome that was fired.
[2:16:16.860 --> 2:16:20.860]  And I have an FBI document from a field agent to-
[2:16:20.860 --> 2:16:25.860]  By the way, my grandmother who died two years ago, my grandfather worked for a major oil company.
[2:16:25.860 --> 2:16:26.860]  They lived in Roswell.
[2:16:26.860 --> 2:16:32.860]  She saw the 18 wheeler with something under it there in town that next morning.
[2:16:32.860 --> 2:16:33.860]  She doesn't know if it was-
[2:16:33.860 --> 2:16:34.860]  She just knew that there was-
[2:16:34.860 --> 2:16:37.860]  Army was there. There was stuff they were taken out of there.
[2:16:37.860 --> 2:16:39.860]  Yeah, not a weather balloon, my friend.
[2:16:39.860 --> 2:16:43.860]  And so what happened is that a technology transfer program happened.
[2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:47.860]  So get back to this dome. I mean, this weapon, what happened?
[2:16:47.860 --> 2:16:53.860]  Well, they fired this electromagnetic weapon, which was the type of very high tech weapon.
[2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:58.860]  It was in 1947. It was early and they were experimenting with it.
[2:16:58.860 --> 2:17:03.860]  It caused these three ET craft to lose their guidance system.
[2:17:03.860 --> 2:17:07.860]  Two, they collided. Two went down near Roswell.
[2:17:07.860 --> 2:17:14.860]  And one wasn't found till 1951 up in the northern New Mexico desert far away.
[2:17:14.860 --> 2:17:19.860]  Now, I have multiple people on my team who've seen the documentation of this,
[2:17:19.860 --> 2:17:21.860]  who worked those projects.
[2:17:21.860 --> 2:17:28.860]  That it potentiated research that Adolf Hitler had been doing on high voltage systems
[2:17:28.860 --> 2:17:34.860]  that cause lifters or electromagnetic lift, so-called anti-gravity.
[2:17:34.860 --> 2:17:42.860]  And so projects that were being experimented on all the way back to the 20s, 30s and 40s
[2:17:42.860 --> 2:17:48.860]  got greatly potentiated because they got a cache of interstellar technologies.
[2:17:48.860 --> 2:17:53.860]  But it's a bit like giving a calculator to a caveman back then.
[2:17:53.860 --> 2:17:57.860]  They had to do a lot of work to figure out even what these things did.
[2:17:57.860 --> 2:17:59.860]  They found a lot of objects.
[2:17:59.860 --> 2:18:03.860]  Did that piss anybody off that we fried a bunch of these things?
[2:18:03.860 --> 2:18:11.860]  Well, luckily, these civilizations are so advanced socially and spiritually that they are not violent.
[2:18:11.860 --> 2:18:17.860]  They're very concerned about us and the fact that we're on the verge of destroying humanity and this planet
[2:18:17.860 --> 2:18:20.860]  and what that portends for us going into space, frankly.
[2:18:20.860 --> 2:18:25.860]  But obviously, and this is a conversation I've had to Pentagon a number of times,
[2:18:25.860 --> 2:18:30.860]  if these civilizations were hostile towards us, we would know it, my friend.
[2:18:30.860 --> 2:18:36.860]  It would be point set match over because you're talking about us doing crazy things,
[2:18:36.860 --> 2:18:39.860]  targeting these objects and downing them for decades.
[2:18:39.860 --> 2:18:46.860]  And they have technologies that are orders of magnitude beyond what we have or could even dream about.
[2:18:46.860 --> 2:18:49.860]  So are these biological robots they're sending in, though?
[2:18:49.860 --> 2:18:51.860]  There are two types.
[2:18:51.860 --> 2:18:53.860]  Some are actually what you're describing.
[2:18:53.860 --> 2:18:57.860]  Some are actually the native lifeforms.
[2:18:57.860 --> 2:19:03.860]  And I know a man who was at Wachuka, which is Army Intelligence Headquarters,
[2:19:03.860 --> 2:19:10.860]  was on my team who was in an underground facility there where there were nine different ET crafts stored
[2:19:10.860 --> 2:19:12.860]  and where the bodies have been autopsied.
[2:19:12.860 --> 2:19:17.860]  And those were native extraterrestrial lifeforms.
[2:19:17.860 --> 2:19:22.860]  So to get back to your question, that technology began to be studied very heavily.
[2:19:22.860 --> 2:19:25.860]  And as you know, Colonel Corso wrote the book The Day After Roswell,
[2:19:25.860 --> 2:19:31.860]  because he had been involved in this technology transfer project in the 50s.
[2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:34.860]  Listen, I can listen to you. I can listen to whoever.
[2:19:34.860 --> 2:19:36.860]  My grandmother wasn't a liar.
[2:19:36.860 --> 2:19:39.860]  And she said there was an 18-wheeler with Army troops guarding it with something under it.
[2:19:39.860 --> 2:19:41.860]  What was under it?
[2:19:41.860 --> 2:19:45.860]  What was under it was a dome-to-disc that was seamless.
[2:19:45.860 --> 2:19:48.860]  One of them got blown to smithereens.
[2:19:48.860 --> 2:19:51.860]  The other one was kind of fractured.
[2:19:51.860 --> 2:19:58.860]  And interestingly, it had a type of bio-nano technology where the skin of the craft was trying to heal itself
[2:19:58.860 --> 2:20:02.860]  like when you saw a time lapse of someone's cut healing.
[2:20:02.860 --> 2:20:07.860]  These technologies that are interstellar are extraordinarily sophisticated.
[2:20:07.860 --> 2:20:10.860]  I liken them to a bio-nano machine.
[2:20:10.860 --> 2:20:15.860]  Well, we're sure lucky that when we kill them, they don't get mad. That is it.
[2:20:15.860 --> 2:20:21.860]  Obviously, if they were the type, if they were violent and oriented that way,
[2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:23.860]  it would have been all over but the shouting, my friend.
[2:20:23.860 --> 2:20:32.860]  But, you know, obviously, these civilizations have evolved not only spiritually and socially but technologically.
[2:20:32.860 --> 2:20:36.860]  Sure, they wouldn't have this technology and not blow themselves up if they hadn't gotten past violence.
[2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:37.860]  Well, they're right back.
[2:20:37.860 --> 2:20:39.860]  We're going to talk about the big picture in Alien Invasion.
[2:20:39.860 --> 2:20:42.860]  State's Alien Invasion Project Bluebead.
[2:20:42.860 --> 2:20:52.860]  As men age, they often experience a slow-down in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:57.860]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[2:20:57.860 --> 2:20:59.860]  Super male vitality.
[2:20:59.860 --> 2:21:08.860]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[2:21:08.860 --> 2:21:13.860]  Now, look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses
[2:21:13.860 --> 2:21:19.860]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:21:19.860 --> 2:21:25.860]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[2:21:25.860 --> 2:21:32.860]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:21:32.860 --> 2:21:33.860]  What are you waiting for?
[2:21:33.860 --> 2:21:35.860]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[2:21:35.860 --> 2:21:37.860]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:21:37.860 --> 2:21:42.860]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:21:43.860 --> 2:21:46.860]  The United States is not communist China.
[2:21:46.860 --> 2:21:49.860]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[2:21:49.860 --> 2:21:51.860]  We don't blow up churches.
[2:21:51.860 --> 2:21:54.860]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[2:21:54.860 --> 2:22:00.860]  But all over the news, we see the U.N. Billable Indigates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[2:22:00.860 --> 2:22:03.860]  praising communist China for their response.
[2:22:03.860 --> 2:22:09.860]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people,
[2:22:09.860 --> 2:22:11.860]  well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[2:22:11.860 --> 2:22:14.860]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying,
[2:22:14.860 --> 2:22:17.860]  we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[2:22:17.860 --> 2:22:20.860]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[2:22:20.860 --> 2:22:25.860]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time
[2:22:25.860 --> 2:22:28.860]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities
[2:22:28.860 --> 2:22:30.860]  and are exposing them in their power grab.
[2:22:30.860 --> 2:22:34.860]  The Resistance lives at BandotVideo and InfoWars.com.
[2:22:34.860 --> 2:22:37.860]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats
[2:22:37.860 --> 2:22:41.860]  and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[2:22:41.860 --> 2:22:46.860]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think
[2:22:46.860 --> 2:22:48.860]  even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[2:22:48.860 --> 2:22:50.860]  I believe in God, and I believe in the long run.
[2:22:50.860 --> 2:22:54.860]  It'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[2:22:54.860 --> 2:22:56.860]  I understand what comes around, what goes around.
[2:22:56.860 --> 2:22:58.860]  You're very quick to show, and I live that.
[2:22:58.860 --> 2:23:00.860]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[2:23:00.860 --> 2:23:03.860]  Now, if I would have hyped up the virus,
[2:23:03.860 --> 2:23:06.860]  it was going to kill three, four, five million people like the U.N. did,
[2:23:06.860 --> 2:23:08.860]  I would have sold five times more supplements.
[2:23:08.860 --> 2:23:10.860]  But you know what, I didn't do that.
[2:23:10.860 --> 2:23:15.860]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient,
[2:23:15.860 --> 2:23:17.860]  people are deficient.
[2:23:17.860 --> 2:23:18.860]  I had that and so many other issues.
[2:23:18.860 --> 2:23:21.860]  You need those products regardless.
[2:23:21.860 --> 2:23:24.860]  So when we started selling out of vitamin, mineral fusion, all the other products,
[2:23:24.860 --> 2:23:28.860]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off
[2:23:28.860 --> 2:23:32.860]  because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis
[2:23:32.860 --> 2:23:36.860]  to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies' offenses.
[2:23:36.860 --> 2:23:39.860]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on,
[2:23:39.860 --> 2:23:41.860]  get your storeable food now.
[2:23:45.860 --> 2:23:48.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:59.860 --> 2:24:00.860]  Welcome back.
[2:24:00.860 --> 2:24:02.860]  Alex, here's our guest.
[2:24:02.860 --> 2:24:03.860]  You want answers?
[2:24:03.860 --> 2:24:05.860]  Well, so does he.
[2:24:05.860 --> 2:24:07.860]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:24:07.860 --> 2:24:09.860]  We got two seconds to laugh with Dr. Steven Brear,
[2:24:09.860 --> 2:24:12.860]  who I really hope will join us again for two or three hours,
[2:24:12.860 --> 2:24:15.860]  maybe do a commercial free podcast in the air clips on the show.
[2:24:15.860 --> 2:24:17.860]  We're geared towards radio and TV.
[2:24:17.860 --> 2:24:19.860]  We're still on air despite all the censorship.
[2:24:19.860 --> 2:24:23.860]  So I've asked a lot of questions here, but I'll be honest,
[2:24:23.860 --> 2:24:26.860]  my grandmother died like 92, three years ago,
[2:24:26.860 --> 2:24:29.860]  and she was about 80, and we went out to Sedona, Mexico,
[2:24:29.860 --> 2:24:32.860]  in a New Mexico, in an RV.
[2:24:32.860 --> 2:24:34.860]  We'd been there about a week and a half.
[2:24:34.860 --> 2:24:37.860]  We came back and we stopped in Roswell at a Denny's.
[2:24:37.860 --> 2:24:41.860]  And I was saying, oh, that made up stuff about a UFO,
[2:24:41.860 --> 2:24:42.860]  a bunch of BS.
[2:24:42.860 --> 2:24:44.860]  You went, oh, really?
[2:24:44.860 --> 2:24:47.860]  When it happened, your grandfather, Bill, who just died,
[2:24:47.860 --> 2:24:50.860]  he worked at the petroleum building right there.
[2:24:50.860 --> 2:24:52.860]  It's the only big building in Roswell,
[2:24:52.860 --> 2:24:55.860]  modern looking building, but built in the 40s.
[2:24:55.860 --> 2:24:57.860]  And I worked right over here.
[2:24:57.860 --> 2:24:59.860]  And my uncle, who just died a few years ago,
[2:24:59.860 --> 2:25:00.860]  he was a little baby.
[2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:01.860]  My mom wasn't born then.
[2:25:01.860 --> 2:25:03.860]  She was born in 1950.
[2:25:03.860 --> 2:25:04.860]  She described this to me.
[2:25:04.860 --> 2:25:06.860]  And so I was like, wow, that has some credibility.
[2:25:06.860 --> 2:25:07.860]  Because I mean, that's grandma telling you.
[2:25:07.860 --> 2:25:09.860]  That's not Stephen Greer telling you.
[2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:11.860]  So Stephen, moving past that,
[2:25:11.860 --> 2:25:13.860]  in the two seconds we have about 20 minutes left,
[2:25:13.860 --> 2:25:14.860]  you've got the floor.
[2:25:14.860 --> 2:25:16.860]  What else do you want to impart to people about COVID-19,
[2:25:16.860 --> 2:25:18.860]  Project Bluebeam, the whole nine yards?
[2:25:18.860 --> 2:25:21.860]  So this audience is ready to hear it.
[2:25:21.860 --> 2:25:26.860]  Well, as a medical doctor, one of my big concerns is that
[2:25:26.860 --> 2:25:32.860]  this pandemic is being managed in a way that maximizes
[2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:34.860]  deaths.
[2:25:34.860 --> 2:25:36.860]  And what do I mean by that?
[2:25:36.860 --> 2:25:40.860]  Not only some of the medical advice has happened,
[2:25:40.860 --> 2:25:44.860]  there's some question whether even ventilators are as productive
[2:25:44.860 --> 2:25:47.860]  as they were initially thought,
[2:25:47.860 --> 2:25:50.860]  but it was greatly exaggerated in terms of its lethality.
[2:25:50.860 --> 2:25:53.860]  That has caused people not to come to the ER
[2:25:53.860 --> 2:25:57.860]  with heart attacks, strokes, pulmonary emboli,
[2:25:57.860 --> 2:25:58.860]  all kinds of problems.
[2:25:58.860 --> 2:26:02.860]  So there's this spike in deaths unrelated to COVID,
[2:26:02.860 --> 2:26:06.860]  which is going to exceed the number of deaths from COVID.
[2:26:06.860 --> 2:26:07.860]  That's number one.
[2:26:07.860 --> 2:26:12.860]  Number two, about 874,000 people die every year in America
[2:26:12.860 --> 2:26:14.860]  from poverty.
[2:26:14.860 --> 2:26:18.860]  We are going to triple or quadruple the poverty rate.
[2:26:18.860 --> 2:26:21.860]  Those deaths alone are going to outstrip COVID.
[2:26:21.860 --> 2:26:24.860]  So we need to find a smart way to do this,
[2:26:24.860 --> 2:26:29.860]  where we do not shut down all of civilization
[2:26:29.860 --> 2:26:32.860]  and turn our country into a police state,
[2:26:32.860 --> 2:26:36.860]  because if we burn down the entire country that way,
[2:26:36.860 --> 2:26:39.860]  it's like burning down a barn to get rid of the rats.
[2:26:39.860 --> 2:26:43.860]  We're going to lose more people from other causes than COVID.
[2:26:43.860 --> 2:26:45.860]  And obviously the establishment knows it.
[2:26:45.860 --> 2:26:48.860]  So I get you say it's humans posing as off-world,
[2:26:48.860 --> 2:26:50.860]  but where's the off-world nexus?
[2:26:50.860 --> 2:26:52.860]  Who's got the anti-empotous?
[2:26:52.860 --> 2:26:54.860]  Who are the bad guys?
[2:26:54.860 --> 2:26:59.860]  The bad guys are a group of sociopaths and psychopaths
[2:26:59.860 --> 2:27:02.860]  that have seized amazing amounts of power
[2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:04.860]  in the post-World War II era.
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:09.860]  And what Hitler couldn't do overtly with the Third Reich,
[2:27:09.860 --> 2:27:12.860]  these guys are trying to do covertly
[2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:14.860]  with what I call the Forth Reich.
[2:27:14.860 --> 2:27:15.860]  Exactly.
[2:27:15.860 --> 2:27:19.860]  And that is just that simple, frankly.
[2:27:19.860 --> 2:27:22.860]  I didn't believe it as a young doctor when I started encountering.
[2:27:22.860 --> 2:27:25.860]  And by the way, I have met with a number of these people.
[2:27:25.860 --> 2:27:27.860]  I was about to say, how did you get,
[2:27:27.860 --> 2:27:29.860]  because they tried to recruit my dad as well,
[2:27:29.860 --> 2:27:32.860]  what makes them try to recruit you?
[2:27:32.860 --> 2:27:36.860]  Maybe one out of 10 million or 50 million.
[2:27:36.860 --> 2:27:38.860]  I mean, what number is a very small number?
[2:27:38.860 --> 2:27:42.860]  Why do they recruit somebody and not?
[2:27:42.860 --> 2:27:44.860]  Well, I believe in my case,
[2:27:44.860 --> 2:27:47.860]  they thought I could be a lot of trouble down the road.
[2:27:47.860 --> 2:27:50.860]  And ultimately, I had three people on my team assassinated,
[2:27:50.860 --> 2:27:53.860]  including a former director of the CIA, Bill Colby,
[2:27:53.860 --> 2:27:56.860]  who was CIA director for Ford and Nixon.
[2:27:56.860 --> 2:27:59.860]  And he was going to hand off to us one of these...
[2:27:59.860 --> 2:28:01.860]  Yeah, kayak, kayak accident.
[2:28:01.860 --> 2:28:03.860]  Oh, allegedly.
[2:28:03.860 --> 2:28:06.860]  Now, the week that happened, what you may not know, Alex,
[2:28:06.860 --> 2:28:09.860]  is that he was going to meet with a member of my board
[2:28:09.860 --> 2:28:13.860]  to hand off an operational zero-point energy device.
[2:28:13.860 --> 2:28:15.860]  We can get into this another time.
[2:28:15.860 --> 2:28:18.860]  He basically pulls energy out of the space around us
[2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:20.860]  that would run your house and business
[2:28:20.860 --> 2:28:24.860]  or factory with no pollution, zero energy costs, et cetera.
[2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:26.860]  This is not an urban myth.
[2:28:26.860 --> 2:28:29.860]  It taps into the dark energy, right?
[2:28:29.860 --> 2:28:32.860]  Yeah, well, it's actually called the zero-point energy field.
[2:28:32.860 --> 2:28:34.860]  Dark matter, though.
[2:28:34.860 --> 2:28:36.860]  Energy field that all of matter and space and time
[2:28:36.860 --> 2:28:38.860]  is fluxing in and out of.
[2:28:38.860 --> 2:28:40.860]  So that is a quantified amount.
[2:28:40.860 --> 2:28:42.860]  That's what my dad told me was a kid.
[2:28:42.860 --> 2:28:44.860]  He said, I know people in the government
[2:28:44.860 --> 2:28:47.860]  can put power plants right in the ground and pull power.
[2:28:47.860 --> 2:28:49.860]  Correct. It doesn't have to be in the sun.
[2:28:49.860 --> 2:28:51.860]  You don't need solar panels, wind any of it.
[2:28:51.860 --> 2:28:54.860]  Now, let's talk about free market.
[2:28:54.860 --> 2:28:56.860]  How do you have a free market
[2:28:56.860 --> 2:28:59.860]  if the most important discoveries in the last 100 years
[2:28:59.860 --> 2:29:02.860]  are being denied to the public?
[2:29:02.860 --> 2:29:05.860]  This is absolute totalitarian nonsense.
[2:29:05.860 --> 2:29:07.860]  But that's what we've run up against.
[2:29:07.860 --> 2:29:11.860]  So when the CIA director was going to hand this off to my team,
[2:29:11.860 --> 2:29:14.860]  that week they found him floating down the Potomac River,
[2:29:14.860 --> 2:29:17.860]  made it look like a canoeing accident.
[2:29:17.860 --> 2:29:19.860]  By the way, I'm not doubting you, Stephen.
[2:29:19.860 --> 2:29:20.860]  This makes perfect sense.
[2:29:20.860 --> 2:29:22.860]  What's the weird logic, though?
[2:29:22.860 --> 2:29:24.860]  You're left alive. He's killed.
[2:29:24.860 --> 2:29:26.860]  Because you were never actually part of the club.
[2:29:26.860 --> 2:29:28.860]  It's like once you sign on, then they can kill you.
[2:29:28.860 --> 2:29:30.860]  But if you never join them,
[2:29:30.860 --> 2:29:32.860]  then you have this metaphysical protection?
[2:29:32.860 --> 2:29:35.860]  Yeah, I've had a couple of near-death experiences with this
[2:29:35.860 --> 2:29:38.860]  and I have other people on my team who have as well.
[2:29:38.860 --> 2:29:40.860]  All I'm saying is that...
[2:29:40.860 --> 2:29:42.860]  That's what I'm saying. It's what protected you.
[2:29:42.860 --> 2:29:43.860]  What protected you?
[2:29:43.860 --> 2:29:45.860]  College of God, why I'm still alive.
[2:29:45.860 --> 2:29:49.860]  I will say that there are people in classified projects
[2:29:49.860 --> 2:29:53.860]  who want us to try to get this job done
[2:29:53.860 --> 2:29:56.860]  who have had our backs since 1998.
[2:29:56.860 --> 2:29:58.860]  That's key.
[2:29:58.860 --> 2:30:01.860]  So there's not just bad guys in this whole thing.
[2:30:01.860 --> 2:30:04.860]  There are some really, really heroic white hats.
[2:30:04.860 --> 2:30:07.860]  And frankly, the upper echelons
[2:30:07.860 --> 2:30:09.860]  of a lot of the military folks I've worked with
[2:30:09.860 --> 2:30:14.860]  and briefed, they are victims of this cabal of sociopaths.
[2:30:14.860 --> 2:30:15.860]  And can you imagine...
[2:30:15.860 --> 2:30:17.860]  Exactly. There's a shoehorned cabal
[2:30:17.860 --> 2:30:20.860]  in between the top and the bottom.
[2:30:20.860 --> 2:30:24.860]  Well, and they actually are sort of seated everywhere.
[2:30:24.860 --> 2:30:27.860]  But in a very compartmented way.
[2:30:27.860 --> 2:30:30.860]  So, you know, you will have one CIA director
[2:30:30.860 --> 2:30:33.860]  who may be read into these projects or briefed on them.
[2:30:33.860 --> 2:30:34.860]  Another one won't be.
[2:30:34.860 --> 2:30:36.860]  And people say, well, what's the difference?
[2:30:36.860 --> 2:30:38.860]  The difference is whether you're willing to go along
[2:30:38.860 --> 2:30:43.860]  with an absolute criminal and outrageous conspiracy or not.
[2:30:43.860 --> 2:30:46.860]  So if you're a good guy, they're not going to tell you.
[2:30:46.860 --> 2:30:48.860]  It's like I told Lord Hill Norton,
[2:30:48.860 --> 2:30:50.860]  a five-star admiral, sea lord,
[2:30:50.860 --> 2:30:53.860]  who is head of the Ministry of Defense in Great Britain.
[2:30:53.860 --> 2:30:55.860]  And I was at his home and he said,
[2:30:55.860 --> 2:30:58.860]  why would they never have told me, doctor, about this?
[2:30:58.860 --> 2:31:00.860]  I said, because if they told you,
[2:31:00.860 --> 2:31:02.860]  you wouldn't have gone along with the agenda
[2:31:02.860 --> 2:31:04.860]  and then you would have been a problem for them.
[2:31:04.860 --> 2:31:06.860]  Because they did a psychological work up on you
[2:31:06.860 --> 2:31:10.860]  and knew that you are a stand-up, patriotic, honest,
[2:31:10.860 --> 2:31:13.860]  God-fearing, good man.
[2:31:13.860 --> 2:31:16.860]  So if you're not someone who can be corrupted
[2:31:16.860 --> 2:31:20.860]  and he wasn't, they're not going to tell you bumpkiss.
[2:31:20.860 --> 2:31:21.860]  Exactly.
[2:31:21.860 --> 2:31:23.860]  They'll even park you in a position of power
[2:31:23.860 --> 2:31:26.860]  so you think you're doing good so you don't challenge them.
[2:31:26.860 --> 2:31:29.860]  Well, and that's the other part of the Truman Show,
[2:31:29.860 --> 2:31:31.860]  as I call it, the movie that Jim Carrey was in,
[2:31:31.860 --> 2:31:32.860]  that we all live in.
[2:31:32.860 --> 2:31:34.860]  And that is, you know, people think,
[2:31:34.860 --> 2:31:36.860]  oh, you've become the president of the United States.
[2:31:36.860 --> 2:31:38.860]  You have an all-access pass.
[2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:39.860]  Not quite.
[2:31:39.860 --> 2:31:42.860]  I mean, let's remember that it's not left or right here.
[2:31:42.860 --> 2:31:47.860]  Jimmy Carter ran on a campaign to get this information disclosed
[2:31:47.860 --> 2:31:49.860]  because he had seen one of these objects
[2:31:49.860 --> 2:31:51.860]  when he was governor of Georgia.
[2:31:51.860 --> 2:31:54.860]  I have his actual report form about that,
[2:31:54.860 --> 2:31:57.860]  signed Jimmy Carter, governor of Georgia.
[2:31:57.860 --> 2:32:01.860]  And when he got to the White House, got elected,
[2:32:01.860 --> 2:32:05.860]  the outgoing director of the CIA, George Bush Sr.,
[2:32:05.860 --> 2:32:08.860]  told him, we're not going to tell you anything.
[2:32:08.860 --> 2:32:10.860]  You don't have a need to know.
[2:32:10.860 --> 2:32:13.860]  Let's see if you can get it from the Congressional Research Service.
[2:32:13.860 --> 2:32:17.860]  And that actually happened to an incoming president of the United States.
[2:32:17.860 --> 2:32:19.860]  The same thing happened to Bill Clinton.
[2:32:19.860 --> 2:32:25.860]  George W. Bush, baby Bush, was actually betrayed, unfortunately,
[2:32:25.860 --> 2:32:27.860]  by Cheney about this.
[2:32:27.860 --> 2:32:30.860]  And Cheney was on the committee dealing with this issue.
[2:32:30.860 --> 2:32:33.860]  But George W. Bush was never read into it properly.
[2:32:33.860 --> 2:32:36.860]  Who knows, then? Who's the priesthood?
[2:32:36.860 --> 2:32:39.860]  I mean, how do they get access to it?
[2:32:39.860 --> 2:32:42.860]  The priesthood, you actually come up through the system often.
[2:32:42.860 --> 2:32:44.860]  Some of it is lineage and family.
[2:32:44.860 --> 2:32:46.860]  A lot of it is they test you out.
[2:32:46.860 --> 2:32:48.860]  They will give you a little bit of information
[2:32:48.860 --> 2:32:51.860]  and see if you will stay inside your compartment
[2:32:51.860 --> 2:32:53.860]  and not violate the secrecy.
[2:32:53.860 --> 2:32:57.860]  If you step a nanometer out, you're done. You're finished.
[2:32:57.860 --> 2:33:01.860]  And so it's a process, it's an iterative process of recruitment.
[2:33:01.860 --> 2:33:05.860]  Now, just to clarify, I have never worked for a covert program.
[2:33:05.860 --> 2:33:09.860]  I'm a private citizen that has run a public interest group
[2:33:09.860 --> 2:33:11.860]  to penetrate those programs.
[2:33:11.860 --> 2:33:15.860]  So we actually are the biggest whistleblower group in the world
[2:33:15.860 --> 2:33:17.860]  on unacknowledged special access projects.
[2:33:17.860 --> 2:33:20.860]  But I have actually never worked for the government
[2:33:20.860 --> 2:33:22.860]  or for any of these covert programs.
[2:33:22.860 --> 2:33:25.860]  And again, there's not just these governmental projects.
[2:33:25.860 --> 2:33:28.860]  There's other private projects as well.
[2:33:28.860 --> 2:33:32.860]  The big action is actually in the private money.
[2:33:32.860 --> 2:33:34.860]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[2:33:34.860 --> 2:33:37.860]  Let's talk about who runs the show with Dr. Stephen Greer straight ahead.
[2:33:37.860 --> 2:33:56.860]  Let's talk about who runs the show with Dr. Stephen Greer straight ahead.
[2:34:08.860 --> 2:34:10.860]  You must decide which side you're on.
[2:34:10.860 --> 2:34:13.860]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome.
[2:34:13.860 --> 2:34:19.860]  Learned out that this will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally death.
[2:34:19.860 --> 2:34:24.860]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:26.860]  The delusions must end now.
[2:34:26.860 --> 2:34:29.860]  Info wars was correct about it all.
[2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:32.860]  And we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[2:34:32.860 --> 2:34:36.860]  Most people that are aware of the new order decide to join it out of fear.
[2:34:36.860 --> 2:34:38.860]  They are truly fools.
[2:34:38.860 --> 2:34:42.860]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[2:34:42.860 --> 2:34:48.860]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[2:34:48.860 --> 2:34:55.860]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale comes up.
