[00:41.680 --> 00:48.880]  Thursday edition and we are going to be here for the next three hours Sheriff
[00:48.880 --> 00:55.000]  Richard Mack is going to be joining us for about 30 minutes in the third hour
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.240]  today he has announced remember he went to the Supreme Court and one of the only
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.400]  big landmark Second Amendment cases back in the mid-1990s he had the Brady
[01:03.400 --> 01:08.200]  Bill thrown out the federal government just went to a new illegal instant check
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.800]  registration system that never got challenged after that but he did have a
[01:13.800 --> 01:18.680]  key states rights victory in his lawsuit against the feds he has announced he is
[01:18.680 --> 01:24.020]  going to sue the Southern Poverty Law Center and I've warned the ADL in letters
[01:24.020 --> 01:28.360]  from my lawyer and I've warned the Southern Poverty Law Center that if they
[01:28.360 --> 01:33.080]  ever say that I'm telling people to kill cops I'm gonna have to sue them because
[01:33.080 --> 01:37.160]  that's dangerous folks the cops believe that stuff that's why when they pull
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.440]  somebody over and find a pocket Constitution or a Ron Paul bumper sticker
[01:40.440 --> 01:44.360]  I've got the squad car video they literally start freaking out like they
[01:44.360 --> 01:48.080]  found a dead baby because they're brainwashed that if people talk about
[01:48.080 --> 01:52.240]  freedom that they want to kill police and they kept saying it about Sheriff
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.560]  Mack and he told him to retract it and they did some little bitty thing in the
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.760]  back of their magazine and he said uh-uh everywhere I go trying to talk to
[02:00.760 --> 02:04.520]  police you know there but you want to kill us thing I'm gonna have to sue you
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.880]  and they're gonna lose because they've admitted he never said anything
[02:08.880 --> 02:14.200]  remotely close to it so we're gonna be talking to him that's an article up at
[02:14.200 --> 02:17.720]  info wars.com from the new American William F. Jasper interviewed him out at
[02:17.720 --> 02:23.480]  the Dumber Society meeting in California and he says he's not happy to have to
[02:23.480 --> 02:27.200]  do it it'll take a lot of time and energy but that he is going to have to
[02:27.200 --> 02:30.960]  sue the Southern Prairie Law Center and he admitted po-talked ahead of it's got
[02:30.960 --> 02:36.320]  on the phone and apologized he's like look the the the horse already left the
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.040]  barn buddy you've told people in all these publications that they mail out to

[03:58.200 --> 04:01.600]  kind of a long one it's a very short simple one it's basically threatening

[08:28.720 --> 08:33.240]  prison planet dot TV I see a headline at prison planet dot com Nigel Farage one
[08:33.240 --> 08:38.480]  of the main UK members of the EU parliament with the headline Europe is
[08:38.480 --> 08:43.280]  establishing a Euro prison well that's why we call it prison planet the
[08:43.280 --> 08:49.040]  globalists in their own words use that term in the 20s they are constructing a
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.040]  prison planet which is an artificial environment where we are in the compact
[08:55.040 --> 08:59.840]  cities highly controlled surveilled where our economy is totally managed and can
[08:59.840 --> 09:06.280]  be incrementally shut down into a post-industrial system in fact Malthus
[09:06.280 --> 09:11.400]  was calling for this almost 300 years ago his ideas were then adopted by
[09:11.400 --> 09:16.600]  Galton and Darwin and others it's all called eugenics if we want to know what
[09:16.600 --> 09:25.760]  governs our world it is eugenics Hitler was a variant spin-off of that and
[09:25.760 --> 09:31.480]  basically only went after certain groups and so the establishment shutting
[09:31.480 --> 09:35.480]  down but as a UT professor the head of the botany department told my father
[09:35.480 --> 09:39.880]  eugenics is good and real it's just Hitler only went after certain groups
[09:39.880 --> 09:45.800]  we're going to go after bad genes across the board through all groups and
[09:45.800 --> 09:50.640]  this weekend running on the treadmill I watched x-men first class and in it
[09:50.640 --> 09:55.080]  there is a Nazi Joseph Mingola type scientist who's actually a mutant you
[09:55.080 --> 10:00.600]  don't know that till later who tortures Magneto and kills his mother trying to
[10:00.600 --> 10:07.040]  make Magneto he exercises powers of being able to control metal with his
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.440]  magnetic you know mutation and later you learn that guy's a mutant too and he's
[10:12.440 --> 10:17.000]  like I didn't like the Nazis I just used it as a way to have power over
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.200]  genetics and the future again it's even in movies the movie The Island which I
[10:23.200 --> 10:26.160]  rewatched this week on the treadmill because I'm now running about eight
[10:26.160 --> 10:32.280]  miles a day and so the three miles and so I ended up watching basically on
[10:32.280 --> 10:38.920]  hour and a half of film at a time and I'm sitting there watching it and the
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.440]  whole thing is about eugenics and world government and artificial habitats they
[10:43.440 --> 10:49.400]  are just throwing it in our face at every level everything I've read in the UN
[10:49.400 --> 10:53.880]  documents the club of Rome documents the MIT reports the Air Force reports the
[10:53.880 --> 10:58.120]  Pentagon reports from the 60s and 70s that we've published and made films about
[10:58.120 --> 11:04.040]  like in game all the futurist quotes all the things they push the the stuff that
[11:04.040 --> 11:08.440]  was promoted by the eugenics into the 20s and 30s and 40s in England which they
[11:08.440 --> 11:12.680]  then changed to transhumanism Aldous Huxley his brother Julian Huxley head of
[11:12.680 --> 11:17.840]  the UN UNESCO program that's the global Agenda 21 standardization of all
[11:17.840 --> 11:21.440]  nations education breeding population everything that's the real head of the
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.240]  UN is the head of UNESCO that's the real power of the UN the global regulatory
[11:26.240 --> 11:29.520]  framework that's why it's all they secretly take your blood in Australia
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.760]  for 40 years the US for 40 years in Germany for 40 years in England for
[11:33.760 --> 11:39.120]  40 years it's it's the same global standardization and when you finally
[11:39.120 --> 11:42.480]  learn about this and you learn they act like we're a bunch of dumb animals and
[11:42.480 --> 11:47.120]  they operate pretty much in plain view it's all the white papers it's all in
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.040]  the reports it's all there from Bertrand Russell all of them about they're
[11:53.040 --> 11:56.480]  gonna establish a world government they're gonna lovingly exterminate most
[11:56.480 --> 12:00.400]  people once it's in place with controlled bio weapons that it's for the good of the
[12:00.400 --> 12:04.400]  earth and then only the super genes will will interbreed and humans will live
[12:04.400 --> 12:09.840]  500 years they're science fiction people but what is science fiction a hundred
[12:09.840 --> 12:14.000]  years ago is now reality in most cases they are visionaries and they will
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.560]  argue they'll say look we built the world we controlled its destiny look at
[12:18.560 --> 12:22.520]  what we've done yeah you've really screwed up humanity you've taken our
[12:22.520 --> 12:26.520]  weaknesses and maximized them because you weren't really just seeking for
[12:26.520 --> 12:33.280]  advanced and specialized people to to to enhance humanity the real eugenics is
[12:33.280 --> 12:38.360]  not positive and negative as we're told that you know making the good even
[12:38.360 --> 12:44.880]  better and getting rid of the bad which is evil on so many fronts because it's
[12:44.880 --> 12:51.040]  just an excuse to tyranny and total power more importantly true eugenics at
[12:51.040 --> 12:54.960]  the real level not the stuff they teach in the colleges for the college students
[12:54.960 --> 12:58.000]  being told you're part of the elite you're part of the good folks you've got
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.720]  the good gene pool still taught at UT still taught everywhere I have state
[13:01.720 --> 13:05.160]  hearings in in-game where they say we've got more than two-thirds of the kids on
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.600]  drugs we're doing all this to me because they got bad genes there's no test they
[13:09.600 --> 13:14.880]  just say you have bad genes but the big secret is they seek to dumb people down
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.760]  and seek a charlotte israeli who worked at the Department of Education father and
[13:19.760 --> 13:23.320]  grandfather skull and bones while she was allowed into those areas head of
[13:23.320 --> 13:26.480]  policy number two there she got all the government documents it's in the big
[13:26.480 --> 13:31.080]  report at prisonplanet.tv skull and bones and education how they set it all
[13:31.080 --> 13:36.840]  up through skull and bones to actually target the smart people and those that
[13:36.840 --> 13:41.360]  they didn't decide to have joined them or wouldn't to be dumbed down the general
[13:41.360 --> 13:47.760]  public poisoned the sodium fluoride in the water all of it and the elite
[13:47.760 --> 13:52.680]  obviously are highly intelligent but they're becoming decadent their own
[13:52.680 --> 13:57.800]  propaganda their own brainwashing their own chemicalization is in their own
[13:57.800 --> 14:01.400]  propaganda brainwashing and flicker rate and the rest of it and the mesmerized
[14:01.400 --> 14:10.040]  TV dream state program has blown back on them the elite today aren't what the
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.320]  elite were just 50 years ago they are out of control they're not focused they're
[14:14.320 --> 14:19.520]  dangerous and so even if you're for this evil plan you've got to recognize it's
[14:19.520 --> 14:23.360]  not going the way they said it would you're not in control you're not god
[14:23.360 --> 14:29.960]  and things are going to happen that are going to be unforeseen okay that said
[14:29.960 --> 14:36.760]  I'm already digressing into a speech here let me restart here with the show
[14:36.760 --> 14:45.600]  right now US war in Iraq is declared officially over but some 50,000
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.400]  contractors are staying and quote embassy staff it bases all over the
[14:50.400 --> 14:53.840]  country so that's not a real removal of the troops the troops that are being
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.280]  taken out are mainly being sent to Kuwait and other staging grounds in places
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.680]  like Jordan for war with Syria and Iran here's another headline Harat Syrian

[15:19.680 --> 15:22.960]  were told about Gaddafi that turned out to not be true and then we learned the
[15:22.960 --> 15:28.040]  West did it and the BBC even a minute yesterday massive Cullings in the tens
[15:28.040 --> 15:35.280]  of thousands of blacks on site in Libya BBC is like oh too bad US troops leave
[15:35.280 --> 15:42.000]  Iraq with heads high as if if you ever leave a country it's some kind of defeat
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  they're not leaving just the main force is being rotated out for the new set of
[15:46.000 --> 15:58.360]  wars doubts fears nag Iraqis as US pulls out and it continues now let's get to the
[15:58.360 --> 16:04.720]  other big news Arab uprising could spark unrest in UK top general says Reuters
[16:04.720 --> 16:09.600]  the British government's also saying the implosion of Europe is a military
[16:09.600 --> 16:13.400]  threat we're going to be getting to all of that it is the planned designed
[16:13.400 --> 16:18.240]  implosion Sheriff Richard Mack is joining us coming up for 30 minutes of
[16:18.240 --> 16:21.880]  the third hour he has announced he's going to sue the Southern Poverty Law
[16:21.880 --> 16:27.440]  Center who has said that he has called for killing police which is of course
[16:27.440 --> 16:31.720]  not true as Sheriff Mack points out he never shot anybody in his years in law
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.040]  enforcement as a peace officer never had to even unholster his gun and has
[16:37.040 --> 16:40.320]  simply taught the Constitution and Bill of Rights and when the Southern
[16:40.320 --> 16:43.920]  Poverty Law Center gets scared of you they say that you say kill cops so when
[16:43.920 --> 16:47.720]  they go train cops Southern Poverty Law Center cops will never look at anything
[16:47.720 --> 16:52.680]  that Sheriff Mack is trying to teach him who by the way defeated the feds at the
[16:52.680 --> 16:56.480]  Supreme Court in the mid 90s on the Brady Bill restricting our Second
[16:56.480 --> 17:00.960]  Amendment so Mack knows what he's doing and he he got an apology over the phone
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.080]  from POTOC who for years has been saying it who's had Southern Poverty Law Center
[17:06.080 --> 17:10.560]  doing it and they printed a tiny retraction in the back of their magazine
[17:10.560 --> 17:17.360]  and that just won't do it Sheriff Mack is going around the country Sheriff Mack
[17:17.360 --> 17:21.880]  is going around the country really upping the ante educating sheriffs and
[17:21.880 --> 17:27.200]  police chiefs everywhere and really going to high gear and everywhere he's
[17:27.200 --> 17:30.200]  going he's they're saying well here's the training manuals they say you say kill
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.120]  us so he went to Southern Poverty Law Center and he said you know you as the
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.960]  federally funded trainers of local and all federal police this is this is wrong
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.360]  and I think I'm going to sue you and so again they he talked to POTOC POTOC so
[17:44.360 --> 17:47.480]  well I'm sorry you're right we went back to the tapes of your speeches you
[17:47.480 --> 17:53.080]  never said that and by the way Mack's pretty pretty calm Gentile and milk
[17:53.080 --> 17:59.160]  toast he doesn't talk about violence and things like that and so they said we'll
[17:59.160 --> 18:03.040]  print a retraction and it didn't do anything but what six months ago when
[18:03.040 --> 18:07.040]  they did it he still gets to hear he's a guy calling for killing cops so he has
[18:07.040 --> 18:10.600]  to sue him to bring it out in the media and point out they did this and they've
[18:10.600 --> 18:15.280]  basically done it to almost everybody I mean it's MSNBC played a clip of
[18:15.280 --> 18:18.800]  myself and Ron Paul out of context where we talked about if they keep pushing
[18:18.800 --> 18:22.000]  things it'll probably get violent but that we're trying to avert it they cut
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.920]  that part off and you know in that special they had rise of the new right
[18:26.920 --> 18:32.720]  and said Ron Paul and Alex Jones want to kill cops or whatever this is the type
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.800]  of this is the standard thing they do so the ADL and Southern Prairie Law Center
[18:37.800 --> 18:41.680]  can come into the departments and brainwash everybody against the Second
[18:41.680 --> 18:45.160]  Amendment against the Bill of Rights the founding fathers I mean these manuals
[18:45.160 --> 18:51.680]  are insane Bob Barr's bad Alex Jones is bad Ron Paul's bad ten years ago having
[18:51.680 --> 18:57.200]  an American flag flying your house was a sign of evil pocket constitutions pure
[18:57.200 --> 19:00.620]  evil and of course people hearing this who are normal Americans aren't brain
[19:00.620 --> 19:04.760]  washer like well that's ridiculous I've got the training videos it's in road
[19:04.760 --> 19:09.720]  to tyranny public online the fireman sent us from a police and fire department
[19:09.720 --> 19:14.800]  sheriff's department meeting a packed packed splash room and FEMA's up there
[19:14.800 --> 19:18.240]  military guy high and tight haircut going George Washington terrorists Thomas
[19:18.240 --> 19:22.400]  Jefferson terrorist they're bad there are enemy people to believe in you know
[19:22.400 --> 19:25.680]  the Bill of Rights are the enemy they want to kill you the cops are in there
[19:25.680 --> 19:29.040]  agreeing with it and then I keep talking about this because it's key evidence I
[19:29.040 --> 19:36.000]  have the footage out of a squad car video and in state police in Virginia and
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.920]  they had a checkpoint they want to search a woman's car and she says no they
[19:39.920 --> 19:45.320]  pull her out find a pocket Constitution and start hyperventilating and leaning
[19:45.320 --> 19:49.720]  on the car like they just entered hell and seen Satan I mean some kind of
[19:49.720 --> 19:54.600]  mind control like they drug the cops or brainwash them somehow we're gonna come
[19:54.600 --> 19:58.800]  back with the the admission that the house passed and it's going to Obama's desk

[24:09.560 --> 24:13.080]  us you got a drudge report dot com on the right hand side you see the headlines
[24:13.080 --> 24:19.920]  coming soon Americans in Gitmo next story Bill Owels in definite detention
[24:19.920 --> 24:26.320]  without trial next link Obama demanded law apply to US citizens next link even
[24:26.320 --> 24:31.000]  Al Jazeera asked how did we get here as Saddam's Constitution said he couldn't
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.040]  indefinitely detain without charges only in America would they be public about
[24:37.040 --> 24:42.520]  it but if you click on that third link it's an info wars dot com link it's funny
[24:42.520 --> 24:46.200]  I was already reading drudge this morning I was telling Watson you got to
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.880]  write another article and send it to drudge because he's covering the
[24:48.880 --> 24:54.360]  indefinite detention and point out that point out that we've been documenting
[24:54.360 --> 24:57.840]  that Obama's been for it all along with the proof and it's sure enough I hit
[24:57.840 --> 25:03.120]  refreshing they had it up there so there is the report indefinite detention
[25:03.120 --> 25:10.640]  bill heads to Obama's desk as White House drops veto threat establishment
[25:10.640 --> 25:15.920]  media and neocons still pretend in the AA doesn't apply to American citizens
[25:15.920 --> 25:20.800]  now let's stop right there this is the type of deception I deal with three
[25:20.800 --> 25:24.520]  weeks ago we learned that they've put the provisions in the bill it says
[25:24.520 --> 25:28.800]  citizens are exempt in one section but another where they always do it says
[25:28.800 --> 25:32.880]  that you're not exempt and you can be secretly arrested disappear forever and
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.360]  then if you connect it to the other acts be executed be tortured and Obama's
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.040]  out there killing US citizens with drones setting the precedent and said
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.820]  we'll do it in America now you see drones going after farmers in North
[25:45.820 --> 25:50.760]  Dakota Air Force they announced North com yeah we're getting rid of positive
[25:50.760 --> 25:54.160]  commentators we'll use the military against you we'll kill anybody in the
[25:54.160 --> 26:02.480]  world including the US so Obama has people come out and say I'm gonna veto
[26:02.480 --> 26:05.920]  that but if you read the fine print he said because I already have that power
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.560]  I don't need to be given the power by Congress which itself is incredible
[26:11.560 --> 26:14.680]  treason there's like he said I don't need their their authorization to attack
[26:14.680 --> 26:19.200]  Libya plus it's peaceful I have you in authorization I get my orders from the
[26:19.200 --> 26:25.360]  UN number six months ago the quote no fly zone and all that incredible things
[26:25.360 --> 26:28.920]  are happening they're fully butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution right
[26:28.920 --> 26:32.680]  now and they've got to do it in plain view so the military and police and
[26:32.680 --> 26:38.320]  bureaucrats go along with it they got a set up highway checkpoints with the Army
[26:38.320 --> 26:44.200]  and Marines to just get you to accept it it's got to be out of the open because
[26:44.200 --> 26:48.080]  they want to go fully operational against everybody so they got to hide it in
[26:48.080 --> 26:54.400]  plain view like it's normal so that people don't stand down they've just got
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.360]  it instead of even selling it they just do it and say that's the way it is after
[26:58.360 --> 27:02.600]  all these years we warned you it was being set up behind the scenes as they
[27:02.600 --> 27:05.520]  announced the world government the global corporate takeover this now
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.760]  happens and so for weeks we have to fight the trolls and I saw the government
[27:09.760 --> 27:15.760]  IP addresses the trolls on our channels the trolls on our websites the IP
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.040]  addresses saying you're a liar it doesn't affect citizens how dare you to
[27:20.040 --> 27:26.280]  make the debate about is it for citizens or not then there's more deception
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.960]  Obama comes out and says gonna veto it the ACLU hails him it fools a bunch of
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.520]  people who later had to retract RT dr. Paul Greg Roberts and others and I'm
[27:35.520 --> 27:40.960]  up blaming him everybody gets fooled then finally I got people to read the
[27:40.960 --> 27:45.080]  subsection and others did and I had Bruce fine other constitutional lawyers
[27:45.080 --> 27:50.680]  on the breakdown what was really there and then Obama we told you Monday I said
[27:50.680 --> 27:54.000]  you watch he will sign it even though he says he doesn't want the
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.400]  congressional power he secretly is for it our congressional sources have told
[27:59.400 --> 28:04.440]  us and then sure enough the video from debate I hadn't even seen surfaced of
[28:04.440 --> 28:08.840]  Senator Carl Levin John McCain all of them it's in Paul Watson's article
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.920]  indefinite detention bill heads to Obama desk as White House drops veto
[28:12.920 --> 28:22.120]  threat Obama was behind it the entire time with the Republicans again to end
[28:22.120 --> 28:25.640]  posse commentatus and use the military against us which they've already been
[28:25.640 --> 28:29.440]  secretly training them for for at least 15 years let's go to one of the short
[28:29.440 --> 28:34.040]  clips of Carl Levin here it is as we got a break and I'm wondering whether the
[28:34.040 --> 28:40.840]  senator is familiar with the fact that the language the language which
[28:40.840 --> 28:49.360]  precluded the application of section 1031 to American citizens was in the bill
[28:49.360 --> 28:53.440]  that we originally approved in the armed services committee and the
[28:53.440 --> 28:59.760]  administration asked us to remove the language which says that US citizens in
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.800]  lawful residence would not be subject to this section is the senator familiar
[29:04.800 --> 29:08.920]  with the fact that was the administration that asked us to remove the
[29:08.920 --> 29:13.520]  very language which we had in the bill which passed the committee and that we
[29:13.520 --> 29:17.920]  removed it at the request of the administration that would have said the
[29:17.920 --> 29:24.920]  app that this determination would not apply to US citizens in lawful residence
[29:24.920 --> 29:27.880]  I'm just wondering is the senator familiar with the fact that was the
[29:27.880 --> 29:33.520]  administration which asked us to remove the very language the absence of which
[29:33.520 --> 29:38.920]  is now objected to by the senator from Illinois I'm familiar now because the
[29:38.920 --> 29:42.640]  center from this okay we're gonna go to break and come back CBS News admits it
[29:42.640 --> 29:50.720]  does affect us citizens get ready they declared war on us we're on the March

[31:10.320 --> 31:14.200]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[31:14.200 --> 31:18.720]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[31:18.720 --> 31:23.520]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[31:23.520 --> 31:27.880]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[31:27.880 --> 31:33.120]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[31:33.120 --> 31:37.440]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists
[31:37.440 --> 31:40.920]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[31:40.920 --> 31:45.480]  check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC

[33:07.480 --> 33:15.080]  We now take you live to the central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the
[33:15.080 --> 33:21.080]  resistance. Rallying Patriots Worldwide.
[33:22.600 --> 33:32.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We had better rally Patriots Worldwide
[33:32.920 --> 33:38.360]  and yeah we have. And you the listeners of these broadcasts that have passed out
[33:38.360 --> 33:43.760]  the DVDs, the books, the information, the audio links, the YouTube videos, we're
[33:43.760 --> 33:49.160]  reaching tens of millions a week now but it's not enough. The system knows we're
[33:49.160 --> 33:54.680]  awake and is just going ahead with absolute total robbery. The head of the
[33:54.680 --> 33:59.080]  CME Group, the biggest commodities exchange system in the world trillions
[33:59.080 --> 34:05.520]  a day, has come out of course as we played yesterday here on air and said
[34:05.520 --> 34:12.280]  in testimony before Congress that core sign of MF Global did know where the
[34:12.280 --> 34:17.280]  money went and took it. Federal regulators would have us believe that now for a
[34:17.280 --> 34:20.080]  month and a half they don't know where the money went. They know where every red
[34:20.080 --> 34:24.720]  scent went just like Forbes and AP and others did a month ago. Much of it went
[34:24.720 --> 34:30.680]  to JP Morgan Chase of private bank accounts, private brokerage accounts.
[34:30.680 --> 34:36.360]  It's a new level of evil just like all of it is launching wars without
[34:36.360 --> 34:41.280]  congressional approval. The Congress makes the laws, the Congress declares war,
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.680]  the Congress authorizes war, now does nothing. Now they come out and they
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.360]  announce, you know what Kellogg Brown and Root of Halliburton built the FEMA
[34:51.360 --> 34:57.040]  camps, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and now we're gonna man the camps
[34:57.040 --> 35:02.920]  and we put that out last Tuesday. It got zero mainstream media coverage, official
[35:02.920 --> 35:08.640]  documents, official links. We got it off a hidden link that was sent to us on the
[35:08.640 --> 35:16.040]  Kellogg Brown and Root site. Media bought and paid for is not media, it is enemy
[35:16.040 --> 35:20.200]  banker propaganda arms and you're not gonna get the truth from them until
[35:20.200 --> 35:26.560]  it's too late. Now CBS News, now ABC News, now Associated Press are you know what it
[35:26.560 --> 35:31.000]  does affect citizens and you will be secretly arrested and disappeared so
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.200]  they can walk into the troops and the FBI and the police and say we now will have
[35:35.200 --> 35:39.400]  people disappear. This is normal and then of course it'll be some Arab
[35:39.400 --> 35:43.160]  terrorists supposedly and it'll be like well at least it's for somebody who
[35:43.160 --> 35:48.480]  looks scary, got a beard and they set the precedent with that. Yeah the
[35:48.480 --> 35:51.880]  government's killing terrorists with drones that are American citizens, what's
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.920]  the big deal? When you get the training manuals that we've published, law
[35:55.920 --> 36:01.760]  enforcement has sent us, it's all about returning veterans number one, gun owners,
[36:01.760 --> 36:11.400]  retired cops, landowners, libertarians, constitutionalist, gunsmiths, business
[36:11.400 --> 36:16.960]  owners, conservative preachers and it's all you conservatives that went along
[36:16.960 --> 36:20.680]  with this thinking, oh we're just getting a foreign enemy, never forget 9-11. I saw
[36:20.680 --> 36:24.040]  some guy driving a car on Vic today, took a photo of it, I mean Lord I was
[36:24.040 --> 36:29.040]  license plate and show it on the TV show or Twitter or something and I was
[36:29.040 --> 36:32.280]  watching you know driving behind him for about 10 minutes today and he had a
[36:32.280 --> 36:37.480]  bumper sticker that said God bless our troops especially the snipers and he had
[36:37.480 --> 36:43.000]  a 9-11 never forget. I was thinking well yeah I mean God bless our troops, most of
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.440]  them mean well and are people with courage and commitment more than the
[36:46.440 --> 36:49.920]  general public, I can admire that of a lot of family in the military and our
[36:49.920 --> 36:53.880]  military certainly has a great illustrious history in many respects but
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.640]  if America was run by a foreign power and was hijacked which it is now what is
[36:58.640 --> 37:03.240]  that military, well it's now like a hijacked bus, the bus may be a nice
[37:03.240 --> 37:09.040]  bus, not bad itself but they're gonna try to run you over with it, it's the enemy.
[37:09.040 --> 37:13.160]  They've been trained that we the people are the enemy, the government has declared
[37:13.160 --> 37:17.600]  war on us, the government is involved in insider trading publicly, the government's
[37:17.600 --> 37:20.600]  involved in narcotics trafficking and money laundering, it's even in the New
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.360]  York Times two weeks ago and no one gets in trouble and the government grows the
[37:24.360 --> 37:30.720]  opium in Afghanistan and ships it out and then as the nerve to try to pull
[37:30.720 --> 37:34.200]  somebody like me over at a checkpoint, I've been through checkpoints and when
[37:34.200 --> 37:40.000]  to search my car like I've got drugs even if I did which I don't, even if I did
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.600]  have illegal drugs it's a joke, they're only illegal to keep the price up, it's a
[37:44.600 --> 37:49.600]  fraud, when you wear that uniform you do now work for a hijacked government
[37:49.600 --> 37:54.240]  that's been caught thousands of times trafficking narcotics, not low-level cops,
[37:54.240 --> 38:02.320]  the entire system, most police now are just there to raise revenue and they're
[38:02.320 --> 38:06.880]  all excited like hunting dogs to find something wrong and and and get patted on
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.560]  the head and get promoted and then lie to people and say there's not quotas
[38:10.560 --> 38:16.200]  when the memos have come out for decades that there's quotas and then when a
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.760]  crime gets committed, it's been a mixed bag in my life and my car's been stolen
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.200]  or house broken into, sometimes they won't even show up, other times they've
[38:25.200 --> 38:30.200]  shown up in five minutes, the point is they can't and won't protect me and the
[38:30.200 --> 38:35.800]  system wants to take my right away to defend myself now despite the system's
[38:35.800 --> 38:40.520]  total propaganda push they failed and the statistics show we've never had more
[38:40.520 --> 38:44.280]  gun ownership in modern America than we have now and the liberals in the last
[38:44.280 --> 38:48.720]  decade are out buying guns and mass and aren't liberals anymore, they get it
[38:48.720 --> 38:52.040]  they're not scared of guns anymore they're learning about empowerment and
[38:52.040 --> 38:56.520]  the minute you buy a gun go take a lesson learn how to shoot it and get that
[38:56.520 --> 39:01.440]  confidence all the rest of your domestication will start leaving you,
[39:01.440 --> 39:07.880]  being domesticated is sad, it is not cozy under the black wings of the new
[39:07.880 --> 39:14.960]  world order vultures, there is no future until we get bold and stand up against
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.400]  these people because we've got a very, it's like going to the doctor and they
[39:19.400 --> 39:23.080]  tell you sir you don't have something like skin cancer or something that's
[39:23.080 --> 39:27.560]  easily treated, you've got liver cancer it's spread to your lungs many other
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.520]  areas, if we act now you've got a 10% chance of living, if not you'll be dead
[39:32.520 --> 39:40.080]  in six weeks, as for tyranny, the way tyranny goes, we've gone into the doctor
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.800]  they've shown us the cat scan, there's cancer all over the country but we're not
[39:43.800 --> 39:50.160]  just one body, ideas are bulletproof and can rise like Phoenix, America is going
[39:50.160 --> 39:54.440]  to completely collapse, I tried to avert it Ron Paul tried to avert it for
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.440]  decades, many others countless other patriots and people with foresight and
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.680]  who were informed were ridiculed and laughed at by the domesticated slaves, we
[40:03.680 --> 40:08.160]  tried to turn this around, it's going to collapse now that there's no there's no
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.680]  stopping that but through the crash landing we might be able to at least get
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.280]  our landing gear down and get the nose up and slow down a little bit so that
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.120]  yeah we crash and maybe roll once but as a society something's left to rebuild
[40:22.120 --> 40:25.640]  with, right now we're going straight down at 500 miles an hour towards the
[40:25.640 --> 40:30.160]  ground, nobody's going to survive it, if we can just people are starting to wake
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.880]  up, the American people should be the pilots, we're flown by globalist madmen,
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.360]  if we can get control of the stick and get it up and get that nose up and slow
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.720]  down enough, we've got a chance at salvaging something and then through all
[40:42.720 --> 40:46.640]  the pain that's going to come, the fact that we aced in the hold the
[40:46.640 --> 40:50.720]  globalist, the fact that we set information warfare time bombs by the
[40:50.720 --> 40:57.960]  millions worldwide with books DVDs material articles our testament of what
[40:57.960 --> 41:02.240]  was coming our warning to the world is there and now like chapters of a book
[41:02.240 --> 41:08.840]  is coming true it's got chills again and if you're not upset and your gut in your
[41:08.840 --> 41:12.440]  spirit you have no discernment folks you need to ask God to open your eyes and
[41:12.440 --> 41:16.600]  open your heart and open your soul if you're not worried and I love that
[41:16.600 --> 41:21.920]  bumper sticker that if you're not upset you're not paying attention and again
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.480]  you think we've gone down the cliff we were just down kind of at the top of
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.600]  the mountain here where it's just at a slight grade you kind of bounce down some
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.120]  rocks get some cuts and bruises doesn't feel too good now we've got one hand
[41:34.120 --> 41:39.120]  hold right there at the edge of a 10,000 foot drop I mean the winds blowing
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.120]  over us we're bleeding our heads bruised we're kind of dizzy and you think
[41:43.120 --> 41:45.800]  you've been through some tyranny you ain't seen nothing yet and we're right
[41:45.800 --> 41:49.560]  there with one hand hold and the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL federal
[41:49.560 --> 41:53.960]  government FBI just department are like little devils on our fingers just
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.040]  stabbing them stabbing the Patriots stabbing Ron Paul trying to get that
[41:58.040 --> 42:03.920]  hand to let go and the hand is they're like little little little insects
[42:03.920 --> 42:10.120]  chewing through our fingers and they want us to fall and we're hanging all of
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.920]  us are hanging together and we need everybody to regenerate the tissue in
[42:15.920 --> 42:19.600]  those fingers by every person you warn every person you speak out to every
[42:19.600 --> 42:23.560]  talk show you call every email you send every Facebook and Twitter you engage in
[42:23.560 --> 42:27.720]  every YouTube video you upload every banner hang you do on a highway every
[42:27.720 --> 42:33.840]  group of police officers you walk up to in a coffee shop and talk to get past
[42:33.840 --> 42:37.680]  that first level of fear that regenerates the tissue as these little
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.240]  demonic beetles are trying to eat the flesh away from our hand and we and if
[42:42.240 --> 42:46.400]  we took enough action our hand would swell in size and power and be able to
[42:46.400 --> 42:51.760]  pull us up and then we could crawl getting the body moving up the cliff
[42:51.760 --> 42:57.160]  back towards Liberty but right now we're hanging over the precipice hanging
[42:57.160 --> 43:01.880]  right now and the traitors are doing everything they can to make sure we fall
[43:01.880 --> 43:05.600]  because they've always hated the Republic they've always hated our
[43:05.600 --> 43:08.960]  liberties they've always hated our freedoms and when America falls the
[43:08.960 --> 43:13.880]  light of Liberty goes out of the world you know growing up I was more ignorant
[43:13.880 --> 43:18.800]  about the world and and and and and how bad it really is and I'd hear oh the
[43:18.800 --> 43:21.960]  United States a lot of the world the city on the hill and Ronald Reagan would
[43:21.960 --> 43:27.360]  say it and despite all our indiscretions and problems we really were that and our
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.720]  country would criticize secret arrest and checkpoints and police brutality and
[43:31.720 --> 43:34.960]  when we did have things like that happen the public got upset people in
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.800]  government got upset and we would get back on course at least trying to go in
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.800]  the right direction but now since the staged events of 9-11 that undoubtedly
[43:44.800 --> 43:48.800]  was a state through the heart of the Republic
[43:50.280 --> 43:53.480]  all over the world every government says we can torture and kill and
[43:53.480 --> 43:59.200]  secretly arrest now America does it and you notice our government doesn't
[43:59.200 --> 44:04.560]  criticize that anymore the United States is now not like a lighthouse to
[44:04.560 --> 44:10.080]  wary ships that are lost at sea now it's actually like a black hole sucking
[44:10.080 --> 44:15.840]  the light out of the world a huge engine of just absolute death and destruction
[44:15.840 --> 44:20.720]  and weakness and I almost wanted at a red light pull up beside that gun roll on
[44:20.720 --> 44:25.320]  the window and say hey you say never forget 9-11 you say God bless our
[44:25.320 --> 44:34.040]  snipers if you really care about those snipers you'd be you'd not want to be
[44:34.040 --> 44:37.560]  mercenaries for the people destroying our country you know what do you think
[44:37.560 --> 44:43.400]  about al-qaeda given control of Libya you do know about that and you know I
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.880]  talked to good old boys now and I was at our deer camp I wasn't deer hunting
[44:47.880 --> 44:51.920]  but there were some deer hunters there and they knew who I was and a month or
[44:51.920 --> 44:57.320]  so ago an opening weekend and they knew who I was and I was talking to them they'd
[44:57.320 --> 45:02.200]  seen the show online and seen me on History Channel and things they're like
[45:02.200 --> 45:05.000]  Alex you know I just can't believe the government would do that and I said
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.920]  criminal elements and I said well you know al-qaeda has been given control
[45:07.920 --> 45:14.360]  Libyan they go yeah yeah I guess Obama is just a traitor Obama's a traitor no
[45:14.360 --> 45:17.680]  no no no no I mean I've been on shows like Mann County says he must be a
[45:17.680 --> 45:22.960]  secret Muslim oh you mean NATO and the Pentagon everybody's a secret Muslim
[45:22.960 --> 45:28.440]  because they because they gave Libyan al-qaeda al-qaeda was created by the
[45:28.440 --> 45:33.600]  Pentagon on record as a big to Brzezinski who set it up at 79 Braggs Saudi
[45:33.600 --> 45:38.600]  Arabia is where they're based al-qaeda goes out and finds useful idiots like
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.280]  the FBI does to go on the airplane or whatever and they're so drugged up you
[45:43.280 --> 45:48.160]  know the the federal government the CIA has to get them on the aircraft and I
[45:48.160 --> 45:51.200]  was bringing up the underwear bomber gotten on the plane and the guy had even
[45:51.200 --> 45:57.680]  heard of that but he just smiled at me and he said there's probably in
[45:57.680 --> 46:00.800]  discrepancies in the Bible but you still believe in that you're still
[46:00.800 --> 46:04.360]  Christian aren't you I said well to take your argument yes I'm still a
[46:04.360 --> 46:09.080]  Christian he goes well it's the same with me I choose this guy was an engineer
[46:09.080 --> 46:13.720]  you know well-to-do smart guy he looked at me and he said I choose to not look
[46:13.720 --> 46:18.560]  at that information my government's good he's an army you know or Air Force
[46:18.560 --> 46:24.760]  veteran the whole nine yards as an engineer in the Air Force and that's
[46:24.760 --> 46:28.720]  what George Arwell talks about 1984 crime stop or double-think he said it was
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.440]  the most intelligent members of the party when shown pure proof that big
[46:32.440 --> 46:39.760]  brother was lying would just say I choose to not see that information and I
[46:39.760 --> 46:42.600]  said you know they got underwear bomber on the plane you know they're giving
[46:42.600 --> 46:45.520]  al-qaeda control of Libya you know they use them against the Serbs and the
[46:45.520 --> 46:49.920]  Russians you understand the government allowed that to happen as a pretext to
[46:49.920 --> 46:54.760]  take all of our liberties I said you know they're trained the military and police
[46:54.760 --> 46:57.840]  go after veterans and people he goes I have seen that in the news I go well I
[46:57.840 --> 47:01.560]  broke that information you understand the bait and switch and he said I see
[47:01.560 --> 47:05.400]  what you're saying but I still just can't believe it and I choose not to and
[47:05.400 --> 47:13.000]  had a twinkle in his eye that is a person willfully not able to face the
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.800]  super creepy fact what about fast and furious confirm they lied about that
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.880]  confirm they ship the guns directly into Mexico confirm they blew the whistle on
[47:21.880 --> 47:27.360]  themselves they knew it was coming out to limit it confirm the government
[47:27.360 --> 47:31.200]  shipping narcotics in you know I mean I had our day surveyed of the awesome
[47:31.200 --> 47:34.200]  police chief in here last week and I cornered him walking out and I said you
[47:34.200 --> 47:37.600]  know they're growing opium in Afghanistan it's in the news you know
[47:37.600 --> 47:41.680]  fast and furious was a staged event you know about this he just gave me the same
[47:41.680 --> 47:46.200]  look and just said well I thought the whole government's not bad I I just can't
[47:46.200 --> 47:52.400]  believe that and I looked at him and I said you've got children I said you just
[47:52.400 --> 47:56.600]  think about the world you're giving them living in your denial the good thing is
[47:56.600 --> 47:59.680]  though when he first came in here four years ago or whatever he was smiling and
[47:59.680 --> 48:03.920]  thought it was all funny he didn't think it was funny anymore and then he he said
[48:03.920 --> 48:07.560]  some private things to me that showed me he's starting to wake up he looked
[48:07.560 --> 48:11.720]  freaked out well you should be freaked out buddy I'm freaked out you think I

[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:41.880]  true another one is old Chinese proverb may you live in interesting times we
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.960]  certainly do that's a two-sided opportunity can also mean danger
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:53.920]  another Chinese proverb the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:00.600]  step and I started my journey 19 years ago on air almost 17 years ago and I've
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.040]  seen what good people can do when they take action and stop over analyzing
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.520]  things by that I mean over analyzing ourselves a lot of so many activists and
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.760]  think they got everything just right and the system sells it like being an
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:21.680]  activist is weird or exceptional like civil libertarians are concerned about
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.120]  secret arrest of citizens oh just civil libertarians you know the people that
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.560]  are into liberty I mean you know who who needs a government that can't
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.840]  secretly arrest you and throw you in a dungeon for no reason I mean that's
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:45.120]  post Roman Empire in Dark Ages you know no law but law the establishment that's
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:53.280]  pre Magna Carta I mean the most virulent fire breathing stinking form of
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:58.320]  corruption that you could even describe and I've got the voting numbers here it
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:05.720]  was a massive majority it wasn't 93 to 7 like the House like the Senate voted for
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.360]  the NDA a secret arrest secret torture secret killings throw away the key
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.520]  whatever throw away the skeleton legislation the House voted for the
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:22.080]  National Defense Authorization Act 283 to 136 and a bunch of traitorous
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.760]  Republicans and Democrats voted for it wow and all these liberals are like
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:31.880]  wow Obama said he was going to veto that now he signed it but they're like at
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.800]  least he said he was thinking about it behind the scenes his lawyers are like
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.400]  make sure we can arrest anybody we want and when I look at him and Michelle
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.400]  Obama on TV or I see photos or images of him on info wars calm during the break
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.240]  I mean they're just out to read enough teleprompters conning everybody and the
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.720]  troops are all standing around them well-meaning good people working for
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:57.520]  this incredible tyrant who himself is just a minion and I just think about it
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.920]  it's like a red dawn scenario but the terrorists the criminals the the the
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.480]  admitted scammers stealing just trillions of dollars I mean that that
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:13.520]  energy company getting a half billion pay off is nothing and you think about it
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.560]  we've really got criminals in charge and they've they've sold torture as
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.760]  sexy and cool and secret arrest and all the movies and large portions of the
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:30.360]  public are dumbed down immoral they they they laugh and giggle and and have it
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.360]  like a coat of infallibility around them that they don't care and laugh at
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.840]  anyone that talks about freedom I think it's cute some of the general public to
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:46.600]  just be moronic and the system looks at you a big fat stupid sheep and their
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.480]  big old vicious wolves which is salivating with acid and they're just

[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.920]  person you're trying to feed it and take care of it and just rolls over and
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.560]  urinates on itself you ever see a dog do that it means I'm fully submitting
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.400]  don't kill me that should be on the American flag is a dog lying on its

[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.760]  radio network
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:18.360]  Paul Watson in his article that's linked up at drudgereport.com on the
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:26.440]  right hand side points out a sickening factoid that I had not noticed in
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.080]  definite attention bill heads to Obama's desk as White House drops veto
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:37.800]  threat establishment media and neocons still pretend in DAA doesn't apply to
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.720]  American citizens even though we have all the major senators that sponsored it
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:48.360]  Levin McCain and Graham admitting it does well I don't need them to admit it
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:53.400]  does it's right there in the stinking bill that's how deceptive they are one
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.440]  section says it doesn't affect you then it says it does that's how they always
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:06.760]  work they're a bunch of stinking lawyers now what's hidden in there today this is
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.080]  the day and Obama's saying they may Robo sign it which has been found to be
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:16.320]  unconstitutional everything he does must be unconstitutional must be uncosher
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:22.200]  constitutionally because they're overthrowing it under the precept of law
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.960]  that might makes right the possession is not into the law and that custom is
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:34.040]  law we are being accustomed to usurpations to swarms of bureaucrats
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:37.880]  eating out our substance to the TSA laying their hands upon us we're being
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:44.920]  broken we're being drugged through the corruption we're being acclimated we're
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:52.640]  being conditioned we're being we're being cowed the house voted last night
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:59.720]  Obama is set to sign it today 222nd anniversary of the Bill of Rights that
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.600]  came years after the country was set up because people are like the government's
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.200]  violating our rights and manipulating this Constitution we want it purely
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.880]  stated that the government's bound down by these ten amendments the
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:17.680]  Constitution Bill of Rights right of religion free press right to defend
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.400]  yourself right to do process right not to not incriminate yourself right to
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.000]  states rights right to all rights not enumerated in the Constitution or
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:36.160]  article 9 all of it so here we are 222 years after Bill of Rights was ratified
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.200]  which was a big deal and hard to get and hard fought for it was almost another
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:51.240]  revolution over it 222 years later on Bill of Rights day they are going to
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.840]  surpass North Korea on paper now that's one thing to implement it and you know
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.960]  they're gonna they're gonna say we secretly arrested this guy that was an
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.080]  American citizen planning to blow up police stations it'll be some Muslim
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.920]  guy but then after a few of those that set the precedent as they've already
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.320]  started to do it's gonna be the good old boy wearing the John Deere hat and
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:17.040]  that's what the entire training is for as evidenced by the New York Times where
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.840]  it shows Explorer scouts I had the Austin police chief in there last week and I
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:25.040]  said you know all over the country Explorer scouts are training to take on
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.600]  returning veterans and kill them and he said come on Alex I started Explorer
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:33.440]  scouts in Austin that's not happening and I went really pull up the New York
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.720]  Times and they pulled it up scouts trained to fight terrorists first line
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.320]  they train going into the building but it's granola Iraq war vets are they
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.160]  taking out and then it shows and I'm all over the country you know I used to get
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.720]  emails by scout leaders going that's not true don't badmouth the scouts not
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.680]  badmouthing the scouts it's been a good organization very wholesome for a long
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:59.480]  time it's being taken over that's like if I said don't let don't leave that dog in
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.520]  here it'll go the bathroom on your expensive Oriental rug it's worth
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.160]  $10,000 you're like don't talk bad about my rug I'm like no don't let the dog go
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:13.200]  the bathroom on it that's the second I mean as long as I'm using the animal
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:20.400]  potty humor to illustrate things that's basically what's going on here and the
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.240]  scout leaders would say that's not going on or or yeah we're trying to take on
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.520]  extremist but what's wrong with that how dare you attack the scouts I remember
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.480]  six years ago the first headlines girl scouts trained to spot terrorists in fact
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:39.680]  go ahead and search engine that'll put it up MSNBC CBS and we got the manuals
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:44.640]  and it's what's in mommy and daddy's medicine cabinet what's that plant
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.240]  roaming your neighbor's yard I mean in this country little kids trained to spy
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.440]  and I had the awesome police chief in here and I'm like I got video of ads that
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.960]  ran on TV and they're shown to kids in school about getting government money
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.400]  cards that put 200 bucks on it when you turn family members in and our days of
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:06.800]  it is like I don't know about that yeah you don't know about anything do you if
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:13.240]  you think living in denial is gonna protect you well then whatever but I
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:19.360]  didn't need to see five years ago MSNBC with the headline girl scouts trained to
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.000]  fight terror or trained to spot terrorists because I had the Hebron
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.040]  Maryland 1998 footage shot by our listeners hours of it in Hebron Maryland
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:38.040]  of Marines running around the city with Boy Scouts for gun confiscation and
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.920]  interviews with locals and when they find out they've gotten the interviews
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.520]  they had the Boy Scouts go tattle on them and the Marines walk over with
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:55.080]  machine guns not not just m16s but but heavier ones with belts on them and
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:59.760]  swing the guns around with the police and say give us your camera turn it off
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.200]  and then they go ahead and detain them and then they explain which is America
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.280]  we're allowed to film this and the police chiefs like get out of my town or
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.480]  I'm gonna find something to do to you they were practicing going door-to-door
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:16.360]  taking guns they had the kids going in the houses and the parents were involved
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:22.000]  in this to help the kids identify guns and since then we've learned it is for
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.360]  America Arcadia aisle with two years ago we have other examples that you
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.680]  understand how mega you and I really woke up 13 years ago starting to go to
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.560]  urban warfare drills and when you get there and the emergency manager of
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.400]  Kingsville shows up and says Thomas Sanchez who's a Vietnam veteran everything
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.320]  and says yeah the the feds approached me about doing this martial law drill for
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.600]  gun confiscation and to train us to accept military occupation then he goes
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.960]  I want you to talk to San Antonio police chief I go to San Antonio police
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.200]  chief he says I'm an army veteran myself and this is the acclimate us for
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.840]  takeover and it's wrong I have it all on tape police state 2000 then I go to
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.520]  urban warfare drills and and they in Oakland and the Marines are training to
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:09.320]  take over cities and the role players are saying they're Americans and it's
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:15.680]  for America they didn't even hide this from me well that's not true something
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.200]  Stephen Jones I think was his name was the former Marine who was their
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.880]  civilian spokesman and he would always catch me in one area and so you're not
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.720]  allowed to be here you can't see this get out here you can't see this
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:31.040]  interrogation all I did was they had local citizen tours of the area they
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:37.840]  cordoned off in the city and I would I just had local listeners who showed up
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.960]  as I was doing the radio show from there over a phone who showed up I would send
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:46.440]  them in to act stupid that's an act real dumb and act ask real stupid questions
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.800]  and they got the hard core footage that's in police state 2000 so of course
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.880]  when I'm witnessing the military trying to take us on and then I get back to my
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.360]  hotel that night at like midnight and I'm watching CNN who'd been there and
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:02.640]  they're like oh the Marines landed in Oakland yesterday and they're just
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:09.920]  training for operations in Macedonia and in Kosovo and I'd been there I had
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:15.400]  footage I was like they were training for America and then you know this
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:20.040]  information you want to warn people you want to tell people and you get made fun
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:25.840]  of you get laughed at I remember that a year later I walk up to a huge I-35
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:31.600]  Austin checkpoint that they'd set up as a test highway was shut down all the way
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.160]  to Georgetown 30 miles north completely shut down going about two miles an hour
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:40.840]  and I pull up I get out I go to the checkpoint all these big lights they got
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.080]  a DUI thing they're pulling a lot of cars and I walk over in the cops like get
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.800]  back Jones and I'm about you know 60 yards away they're like what are the
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.160]  Serbs gonna get us oh the the foreign troops are gonna get me in the cops are
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:59.760]  all here they are running a checkpoint totally unconstitutional and they'd all
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.000]  I guess heard my show we're seeing it the TV show and I had the commanders and
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.880]  people all stand up if 50 yards away just rolling slapping her on the back
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:18.520]  it's all on tape he's gonna be a police state I'm like I know you think it's
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:23.520]  funny but it's not then I walk over another police car in the dark and
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.240]  these guys were obviously completely stoned out of their minds smell the
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.280]  marijuana and I'm like well what are you gonna do they're like we're gonna
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.720]  follow our orders
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.600]  I just worry it's so horrible and I told you that right along with all this
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.080]  would be having your money stolen all right here's the deal I'm gonna take

[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:20.400]  13,500 troops to provide Olympic security the BBC is reporting that when
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.160]  they have the event over in Europe again everywhere they are using the
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.320]  military now they're just acclimating the citizens so they can use the
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.560]  military against you let's go to Eric who's a police officer in Illinois then
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.400]  Mike who's military in Colorado Elaine who's a police officer in Pennsylvania
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.800]  let's get your take on all this right now Eric what do you think of the
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.000]  government getting rid of the heart of the Bill of Rights on Bill of Rights day
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.120]  200 plus years later Eric I think it's a complete travesty it's amazing what what's
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:25:00.680]  going on in this country what is your overall view on it what where do you
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.080]  think the nation's going what are your fellow police officers think well most
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:12.160]  of them are completely entranced in the system that you know the media there they
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.120]  fall right into the the left right Republican Democrat propaganda machine
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:21.280]  I know I can tell you that the majority officers are good people with
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.840]  families and kids and they want to do the right thing they got into the
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:31.960]  profession to help people but if if this were enacted right now I can tell you
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:37.000]  that the officers would not go along with it however I've been studying the
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.120]  New World Order system for several years now and you know they're gonna be
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.800]  staging terrorist attacks in the country or the economic
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:50.200]  compulsion and if you have complete chaos the police the numbers alone my
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.800]  department we're about a thing about 200,000 we have about 250 sworn officers
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.520]  we don't have near the manpower that can even deal with any type of mass mass
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.480]  chaos know exactly they're setting it up where the military will be needed and
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.920]  again then the precedent sets so the first 10 15 times the troops are used
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.880]  they're gonna actually maintain order then the precedent set we're just here
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.800]  to arrest the troublemakers now so this doesn't happen again and the public's
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.960]  like yay I've even got internal training videos that I play clips of that
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.080]  we're gonna air more in the future where they set everybody up for this but
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.920]  you're absolutely right when you call it the New World Order system Eric that's
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.400]  what it is it's a global system of manipulation but because of you and
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:40.120]  others out there once people see the system they're gonna be aware of it
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.560]  doing that you know the guys on my shift you know I'm constantly you know
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.000]  talking in their ear and I've made them aware of it I got most of them you know
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.880]  are gonna be supporting and voting for Ron Paul but it's it's you know there's
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:57.200]  some that you just can't you can't change the mind and they're so they won't
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.720]  even you know hear it or look at the the evidence that you try to present
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.600]  Eric you said you've been awake for a few years in that time the other police
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.720]  have called us and talked about how they got made fun of it first in military
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:14.320]  too but later as the stuff comes true they go from being called tinfoil hats
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:21.040]  to you know Nostradamus have you seen something similar like that yeah I mean
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.200]  you still get the you know the laughs and all its conspiracy and you know
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.000]  they're just they cannot believe that something like this can go on because
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.760]  they believe that something this big people would talk people would come
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.080]  out and they just it but unfortunately you know it's like you say you planted
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.800]  the seeds and then when when the you know when it when when the collapse
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.160]  happens and the and you know what hits the fan you know that's when they will
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.600]  wake up and and realize man this really is going on we're gonna go to break in
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.440]  the long seven come back with others but just briefly what do you make of the
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:02.000]  of the lies within lies within lies where first they say citizens aren't in the
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.520]  secret arrest indefinite detention bill when they're clearly there then they
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:09.200]  say Obama's against it don't worry he's gonna veto and I'm like nope that's to
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.160]  make people stand down and not fight the bill and then sure enough he does it I
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.440]  mean for the general public they're totally flummoxed by it it's like ACL you
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  shocked but but but but when you're aware of it you know the next play that's
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:26.440]  what's so frustrating I know exactly what they're gonna do I told everybody
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:31.480]  again and it's not because I'm smart it's frustrating Eric I know exactly what
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.360]  they're gonna do because I know their playbook it's so frustrating I completely
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:41.080]  agree it's completely frustrating and because the what the problem is is they
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.680]  hear the snippets on the nightly news or on the on the radio talk shows but they
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.160]  never read the bill they never look at the you know in depth that what it
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.880]  actually says they just they hear the the mantra that's that's put out in the
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.480]  media system and that's what they believe and and you know everybody's busy
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.160]  with their own you know in between work and their own lives and you know doing
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.040]  what they do and you're right you're right we've got to make time to learn
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.040]  reality or we're gonna be doomed those that don't know history are doomed to
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.880]  repeat it the people perish for lack of knowledge I appreciate your call again
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:18.800]  I've been monitoring neocon mainline fake conservative Rhino radio and they and
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:26.200]  if we can't shoot down politically Newt Gennrich in these primaries he will end
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:33.040]  up if he runs against Obama he wins because once they have Obama who's
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.920]  hated by conservatives against Gennrich they'll back Gennrich not knowing
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.400]  Gennrich is actually votes exactly the same that's what's scary I mean Gennrich
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.280]  is an actual globalist he's even higher level than Obama I mean he's one of the
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.600]  insiders and here Neil Boerts endorsing a man that's traitorous we're on the

[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:10.120]  I have been posting all of your videos I have been talking nonstop on Facebook
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:17.360]  regarding these issues and I have gotten probably three positive comments in the
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:22.480]  past seven months they're calling me crazy at work but it doesn't deter me I
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:28.480]  continue to post what I can well they call you crazy in the mid 90s they
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:32.400]  called Ross Perot crazy saying NAFTA and GATT would shut down our industry it
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:36.520]  did I mean I guess if you gave somebody the winning lottery numbers you'd be
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:41.040]  called crazy or have you told somebody to drill for oil in 1870 and you
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.520]  discovered it became a billionaire you'd be crazy I mean all of this is
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:49.320]  happening the whole world admits this is horrible and then you're being called a
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:57.160]  cook it bothers me that people cannot see at this point in time in our city
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.040]  they're trying in our county they're trying to roll out agenda 21 they're
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:06.320]  calling it sapa if you look at them sapa map and if you look at the agenda 21
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:13.480]  map it is identical I have been by created a Facebook page I've gotten no
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:21.880]  comments whatsoever none it's very very distressing I care about people I don't
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:26.160]  like what I see what's happening in different departments I don't like
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:32.840]  keep standing on people's rights I will not go along with this absolutely no
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.800]  way will I ever go along well I'm sad that you I'm sad you feel like you're
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:41.000]  alone let me assure you if you were publicly known you would know that
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.760]  Liberty is on fire and that the biggest news sites out there are all quote
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:51.800]  conspiracy sites that mean sites that actually question the system I've talked
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.200]  to a lot of police here on air you've heard them say that on average about half
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:00.280]  their department or more is now awake but there are pockets where people aren't
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:05.920]  very awake and also what happens is on average folks that are on Facebook and
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:11.640]  things on average it's it's kind of dumb down it's about partying and where
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.200]  you're going and friends and so people don't really want to hear about it there
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.360]  that's why we've never been I mean we're big on it Facebook and Twitter but
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.720]  nothing compared to folks that are just in the entertainment business because
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.920]  you know that's more of like a digital bar you don't want to go to the bar you
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:31.200]  know to hear about you know tax forms or something and so that's why you're
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.920]  seeing that happen I would suggest that you get into you know creating an
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:40.720]  identity on some of the message boards like prisonplanet.com the forum or
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:45.520]  places like the Daily Paul or you know any of those forums out there and
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.360]  there's trolls there as well I mean a lot of these people are what they call
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:53.400]  sock puppets it's really programs that will come out I mean we've tracked the
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.720]  IP addresses of these telling us we're cougs we're scum we're evil and a lot
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.640]  of times it's a sock puppet doing it it's not even a human show don't feel bad
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:05.400]  in fact if you want to plug your Facebook you're welcome to I guarantee
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:10.920]  you'll find some fellow people in Pennsylvania Elaine. Absolutely my name
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:17.800]  is Elaine Bozak I have a page on Facebook it's a post implementation of
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:25.040]  STAPA agenda 21. Awesome. I posted so many videos I'm trying to wake people up I
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.760]  will not be deterred I will not be deterred I do not care what they call
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.840]  me I just have to go straight ahead I can't look left or right and I will
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.720]  continue to do this and I God bless you Alex Jones. Well God bless you and I
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:42.800]  appreciate your call Elaine I hate for folks give their name out on there because
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:45.840]  sometimes people can abuse that and say somebody's name who they are and I can
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.560]  tell Elaine is who she says she is just from her voice but plus it's a Facebook
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:54.040]  account so that's good folks go check her out there she's opposing the UNESCO
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:57.760]  agenda 21 global takeover folks might want to find out about that and discover
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.800]  that your town your city your county in almost every case is adopting it and
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:06.000]  even has documents saying they're adopting it they've got signs up at the
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.080]  some of the parks here in Austin saying it's part of a UN takeover all the big
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:16.200]  national parks have them and I was at the Grand Canyon a month ago and you've
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.200]  seen the video of it happening nobody's around maybe every two minutes somebody
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:24.160]  walks by I'm at the visitor center out on the side of it out there with the wind
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:31.080]  and drizzle and I get into the little portico and start videotaping the UN
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:36.200]  sign that says it's been handed over to the UN as I did 14 15 years ago in my
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:42.520]  that's in my film America to show about design and I start talking about the UN
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:46.840]  taking over America then I'm going your calls I'll finish the story I start
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:53.160]  talking about that and all of a sudden a guy wearing like a windbreaker with
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.560]  American flags and stuff all over it older gentlemen like he's probably about
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.880]  65 70 comes over and says hey you know his wife and I need to take a photo of
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.920]  this this guy won't be quiet he's talking he's just kind of like bull into my
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.760]  space so I turn around say oh you don't like what I'm saying oh you want to you
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.200]  know get in the shot okay I'll put you on YouTube but the minute he heard me
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.600]  talking about the UN taking over America he's like huh see it's unpatriotic to
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.760]  say America's being taken over because he doesn't want to have to face that he
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.680]  just wants to say how dare you say America's got a problem he's lazy he's
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.720]  delusional so he thinks if you call up and say hey there's a fire at this
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.560]  location please send a fire truck it's almost like he's saying you you set it
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.600]  on fire or if he just says there's no fire it doesn't exist we're the ones
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:51.160]  warning people and he's like hey don't you talk bad about America but that's
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:54.800]  what people do when on average when a doctor tells them you know they've got
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.720]  some horrible disease they'll get mad and say I don't believe that doc and
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:04.640]  stomp out it's called denial and denial is one of the biggest problems we face
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:08.720]  but the fact that you're being made fun of you know I wouldn't worry about it
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:14.040]  and a lot of these sheep only go off title and and officialdom so start as a
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:19.720]  private citizen your own you know Pennsylvania group against a gen 21 put
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.800]  out you know ads in places the first meeting five people might show up if
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.700]  you're lucky at the library but you stay on it like a woodpecker you'll have
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:31.760]  thousands listening to you within a few years all right I'm gonna shut up and
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.520]  go to your calls now I am long-winded aren't I Mike who's military in
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:41.440]  Colorado giving us his view on it being Bill of Rights Day 200 plus
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:48.120]  anniversary what 222 years and this is the day that it goes to Obama's desk to
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.040]  be robo signed to allow citizens to disappear into black holes what's your
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:56.440]  view of this Mike we were always told that the really bad guys do stuff like
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.280]  this but Stalin and Hitler wouldn't put it on paper I guess only America does
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:06.780]  that well you know it's it's not great Alex no it's it's not but um you know I
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:11.800]  don't really want to talk about Obama my my my question to you is about Ron Paul
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:18.120]  actually that's okay sure whatever um so you're aware that Ron Paul said there
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:24.560]  is absolutely no evidence that 9-11 was an inside job right I don't have to
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:29.760]  agree with Ron Paul on a hundred percent of stuff he has talked about the
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.720]  government staging Gulf of Tonkin he said fast and furious is a criminal
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:37.600]  false flag and that holders should be criminally investigated he's a
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:43.160]  constitutionalist and so I mean I know Ron Paul personally I know people that
[01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:48.200]  know him personally for decades he is the real deal he is a great man and so
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:54.480]  people get mad at him that he's not going into 9-11 truth I think at a
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:58.680]  certain level Ron Paul understands that that would be at his level political
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:04.040]  suicide to do that I'd completely agree I mean why would anyone believe
[01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:08.480]  something so crazy like that you know I would someone like Ron Paul associate
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:14.040]  themselves with you I mean he's trying to win the presidency and here he is
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.000]  going on the Alex Jones show come on yeah well and I could tell you got a
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.440]  cynical fake satisfied sound to your voice and you heard Ron Paul in the
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.960]  show if you've listened before or that's maybe your first time of your
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.960]  seminar caller but the point is Ron Paul talks about the Gulf of Tonkin being
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.000]  staged he's talked about the CIA shipping drugs into the country they
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.840]  talked about the guns being shipped in to Mexico and drugs back into this
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:46.320]  country being a false flag so when there's bona fide proof Ron Paul will go
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.880]  with it but when it's building seven blowing up and all the rest of it
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:56.480]  clearly the official story of 9-11 has holes in it it's clearly not true but
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.120]  then it becomes a quagmire so I think Ron Paul has probably done the right
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:04.520]  thing overall not not going there because it can't be a hundred percent
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.600]  proven one way or the other we just know the official story is a fraud Mike
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:12.800]  Mike I heard you said you don't want to go because I open the phones up and I
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.000]  don't screen the calls but once a week or so I say it's specifically on a
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.040]  subject I said I want to hear military about secretly arresting citizens do you
[01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:24.600]  kind of get a thrill up your leg when you think about you know playing video
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:28.760]  games against the American people I mean is that kind of thrill you no it
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.720]  doesn't Alex but I'll tell you this much you and you know your whole team is
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.760]  it's bringing down the cause quite a bit you're making all those true patriots
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:43.560]  look like idiots that's what I think about that listen to your listen to your
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:51.600]  fake satisfied voice in fact what do you really do for a living Mike I got it I
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.640]  gotta disguise my voice a little bit all minute but no no no Mike Mike Mike
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:03.000]  you're not in the military excuse me we're taking calls from people in the
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.160]  military about police and military will you violate the Constitution now that
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:12.400]  they've basically tried to overthrow it and you called in to talk about me
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.920]  bringing down the cause I appreciate your call the cause is liberty and I have
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:21.560]  my first amendment and I am enlightening and awakening people and I am trail
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.240]  blazing covering the hardcore subjects that no one else will cover so it makes
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:31.120]  it easier for people to cover other subjects I'm moving the Overton window
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:36.760]  further towards liberty and freedom by by by by being extremely brave and
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.960]  really saying it like it is you know what the Overton window is probably not
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:47.040]  that caller probably doesn't that's a political theorem dealing with you have
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:50.480]  a political window of what's acceptable and the globalist have moved it slowly
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:57.000]  to be anti-family anti-free market domesticating us into tyranny of what's
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.880]  acceptable and there's a tactic to really do have groups to extreme things to
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.160]  to to pull it one way or the other so they're doing all these extreme things
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.080]  to make it look like it's not extreme to move towards it a little bit I'm trying
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:14.880]  to go towards liberty and I am trailblazing and my material has been
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.120]  seen on YouTube alone by over 350 million people in the last two and a half
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:26.360]  years I reach 15 million people on XM on AM and FM on global shortwave on
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.880]  satellite on number one talk radio show on the web number one even above music
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:36.440]  on shoutcast yeah I'm a failure clap me my work for the military actually with
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:42.600]  that Psyop or or you're so conditioned by the society that the zombies will
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.560]  actually regurgitate Psyop at you because they've been programmed with it but
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:52.040]  you're bringing down the cause you're failing you're a failure your teams of
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:56.160]  failure you wanted my team to feel like failures we'll just put in some extra
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.800]  hours today just to show you what failures we are your attack on us shows
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:06.640]  you're bleeding out and how weak you are that's what it shows I know we're
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.800]  winning I know we're gonna defeat tyranny because we planted the seeds
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:15.440]  beforehand and you're not gonna dissuade anybody from that Ron Paul has
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:18.840]  exponentially grown in popularity even if he doesn't win which he has a good
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.880]  chance of doing now even though with their election fraud he wins by getting
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:28.920]  issues out there that'll grow and grow and grow you know Ron Paul when he was
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.520]  on with us four years ago he launched his campaign about three four months
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.040]  before he said I want to thank you Alex half of our support has come from your
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:41.520]  audience from them from the numbers we've got the studies we've done my
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:46.400]  audience of great patriots was half the launch pad for the test rocket four
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:50.720]  years ago against the New World Order now the new prototype is doing probably
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:55.440]  five to ten times putting in which actuary better than it did four years
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:02.760]  ago in liberties being discussed and real issues are being put out there and
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.560]  of course we are many many times exponentially what we were four years
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.800]  ago yeah we're failing ha boy you better know we're gonna kick your hind in
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:16.840]  and we're gonna win we're gonna win big time and you and your psyops aren't gonna
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:21.360]  work on us zombie let's go ahead and talk to colonel six in the military
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:27.120]  colonel six what's on your mind what's your view of that last caller I can't
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:35.960]  say I've got what they call a legendary temper and it is my the word of my
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:44.320]  temper goes before me so I'm gonna just leave that like it is you know what I
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:50.960]  will say this there could be no one better that any candidate could be a
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:58.920]  associated with then yourself because you are a person that over the years has
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:04.240]  persevered you know when people have to get had to listen to you had to go out
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.960]  to the lake to listen to you because you know that dude's crazy man but I like
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:16.240]  sort of stuff he says man you're coming to pops cut it off you know and you know
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:25.360]  now everything everything that you say was gonna happen has come true every
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:32.760]  damn thing what have you lied about you see and that's the point if you could
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:37.000]  show me I don't care if you don't like the man because you say you've got
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:46.840]  grungy hair it looks like aqua long and all that okay but there's a man lie you
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:55.960]  see and that's the whole point you are so truthful you break you know since
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.600]  you know that people have this this feeling about you then you double and
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:05.960]  triple back up what you have to say okay and I don't think guys guys like Steve

[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.560]  across the board is freaking people out because then they might not be able to
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.720]  call me a cook they might have to actually look at what we're dealing with
[01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:51.000]  stay there I want you to give us your take on military to be used against

[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:15.800]  demonizing him Ron Paul has hit the zeitgeist Joe Rogan is gonna be on what
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:20.880]  the Tonight Show with Jay Leno tomorrow night with Ron Paul that should be
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:25.240]  interesting I'm gonna go back to Colonel Six and others here in this segment the
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:28.680]  next then a Sheriff Richard Maxx gonna join us he's getting ready to sue the
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:32.360]  Southern Parvati Law Center for saying that he was gonna tell people to kill
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:36.280]  cops which is again totally untrue they've had to admit it's not true and
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:40.440]  they just do that so that the police will listen to them and buy their
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:45.000]  anti-American garbage and I'm not a litigious person but I've told the ADL
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.960]  and Southern Parvati Law Center I put them on notice hold them one more lie and
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:55.240]  I just because they need to be punished but they get taxpayer money the tens of
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:58.440]  millions of dollars so they probably just pay people the lawsuit with the tax
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.440]  money they don't care they've got to demonize this but before I go back to
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:07.120]  Colonel Six look I know what's gonna happen next because the globalist have
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:11.360]  a program a new order system like that police officer called it earlier that's
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.120]  where it is it's the same in each country they tweak it here and there but
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:21.320]  in fact you Jeremy can you put that Minnesota article up all over the nation
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:27.280]  the last five years Homeland Security has Marines Army and others just type in
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:34.800]  Army and Jaws of Life Homeland Security oh helping at Carrex helping with drunk
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:43.080]  drivers oh the Marines are running a checkpoint all of this is happening and
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:46.520]  you pull up there's Marines with guns they try to search your car so it's
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:49.960]  always this PR but it's illegal and Jeremy found that article during the
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:53.400]  break we put it up on screen for me the Minnesota one about the Jaws of Life
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:58.120]  there it is Army Combat Brigade to take on first of its kind Homeland Security
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:01.360]  Detail so people ask well how do you know that we're gonna have DWI check
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.800]  points and and helping at Carrex and the Army star-flighting people it's all
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:10.440]  just a PR Psyop so the military feels good about the mission so the citizens
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:14.880]  feel good about it and then you get the actual next level training it's let's
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:19.240]  take on those gun owners and I showed you those articles so that's what's
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:24.960]  happening I mean I last year I sent the crew up to Illinois to show the drill
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:28.960]  and they had the troops trained to put Americans in camps it's all on tape
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.440]  Colonel Six go ahead and make your points about what I was just raising and
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:36.940]  you're concerned about him going ahead and passing this and Obama now says
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:41.040]  he'll sign it the military the end deposit commentators and US citizens
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.520]  disappear into black holes well you know Alex I think the thing that hit me
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:50.240]  right between eyes and this again this is something that no one but you can get
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:57.280]  except for listening Alex Jones I never would have known that this the 222nd year
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.680]  since this has been passed and on that day and I bet you it could it may have
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:11.080]  been a Thursday if we can go back that far a man that not everyone is thoroughly

[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:54.240]  I saw the one I thought this one is an hour and 20 minutes wrong okay what's the
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:58.080]  name of it and I'll look at it and we'll post it at info wars.com what's the name
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.240]  of it I call it rap for the soul you know I'm saying I'm sending it to you it was
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:05.720]  just a lecture that somebody taped and they gave it to me I got this back in
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:10.880]  in the spring of 1980 Alex that's how long I've been woke you understand people
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:13.800]  always talk about him they say everything he talked because I've never
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:19.160]  really heard it I've heard like short clips of it I tell us about him well he
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:24.640]  talked about how he was inside the Illuminati because he was into the
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.160]  satanic religion and he thought it was just a religion you know and he talked
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.360]  about how he was saved and how he wanted to get out of it but the only way I
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.200]  thought that they had they was going to kill him and so he talked about he went
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:41.840]  to a Grand Druid Grand Druid meeting and what it was it was just a lot of
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:45.440]  glorified bankers paying a lot of money to a lot of people in political and
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:51.960]  religious organizations and a lot of them the the things that you see in the
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:56.480]  church is pay-offism they've taken the money and rejected the Lord and they
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.440]  talked about how the bankers he talked about how the banks owned all of your
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:05.560]  politicians all of them were part of this religion and he gave us eight-year
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:09.960]  step-by-step plan in that they would bank up their own companies destroyed
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:14.400]  their own companies but be so financially strong they would withstand it
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:19.320]  after they destroyed the economy of the world which we're at now he said he
[02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:23.960]  talked about the book at the shrugs and that one of the last lines in the
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:28.440]  book was that when you hear them say the life of New York has gone out for the
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:35.280]  last time we will have the world when I saw on 9 11 Tom broke off spoke those

[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:47.080]  spine this was at 9 11 2001 September 11 he spoke those words when the towers
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:51.480]  fell now they are a cult they are a cult that's why they do I've talked to some
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:56.040]  very famous people and of course it's off record who have actually been in the
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:01.720]  Hellfire Club in England out in the caves out there by Oxford and of course
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:04.960]  they won't come on here and talk about it but I mean this stuff's real I mean
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:09.800]  at the eyes wide shut all of that it really is devil worshipers that run it

[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:44.560]  with the highest number is Ron Paul the National Defense Authorization Act gives
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:51.680]  Pentagon green light to wage internet war and to shut down alternative media

[02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:01.080]  is a free speech kill switch that we are dealing with
[02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:08.920]  Obama's U-turn on indefinite detention bill a historic tragedy for rights also

[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:59.880]  see history isn't hasn't wound down yet it's going forward and we can still
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:04.560]  change things we can still put the brakes on no matter how bad things get
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:09.480]  it's a it's a it's an inside job it's something inside of us we have to change
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.720]  and say I'm gonna recognize evil I'm gonna recognize corruption I'm gonna
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:18.960]  work on it myself first and then I'm gonna work on it with others around me

[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:45.440]  secretly arrest citizens I'm gonna do it anyways and I've been doing it but then

[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:29.280]  points it's been revealed predator drones being used in the US against farmers
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.120]  and people with the Air Force running and calling him domestic terrorist the
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:37.880]  Department of Homeland Security says that paying for a hotel room in cash is a
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:41.480]  sign that you could be a potential terrorist we've got all the government
[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:46.600]  training videos of that showing TSA and hotels malls street corners football
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.000]  games and they're getting you ready number three as I have written about
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.480]  previously authorities in Tennessee authorities are going door-to-door
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:57.600]  conducting assessment of how prepared residents are the following comes from a
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:03.120]  recent news report out of news five and it goes over that number four government
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:07.560]  again authorities not servants track nearly everything we do example one
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:12.000]  woman in Washington DC had been fined $2,000 for not properly recycling
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:19.920]  homemade cat litter and out of old newspapers and junk mail that's right
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:25.560]  $2,000 they dig through your trash folks the green police remember the
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:30.120]  Audi commercials not a joke that they want to genetically modify organisms and
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:33.280]  dump them out in the environment and butcher and press pass on their life
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:37.520]  forms that's okay they make petty things environmental crimes just like in the
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:40.560]  movie Minority Report face-tracking technology is now being used and
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:44.760]  advertising billboards all over the nation number six police are not just
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:48.520]  using tasers or hardened criminals anymore now tasers are even being used
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:55.600]  on young schoolgirls five-year-olds and others it goes over 14 to 5 they're
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:59.400]  using them a number of very elderly women have come forward with stories of
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:04.000]  strip search by the TSA TSA said well we don't call it strip search but yeah we
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.520]  take your clothes off totally sick I mean what are they gonna do next it's all
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:11.800]  about forced inoculation it's all about government training you to have and put
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:17.400]  their hands on you Americans are being watched in hundreds of different ways
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:21.920]  each day most of them no idea what's happening for example in DC the movements
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:25.320]  of every single car track using automated license plate readers the following
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:30.600]  comes from a recent Washington Post article imagine all the criminal stuff
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:34.320]  they allow the system to do with that remember they're the bad guys around the
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:38.800]  system now not good guys with all this power as the founders said even if you
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:43.200]  gave good guys this power bad guys would get in control of it like the ring of
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:47.720]  Mordor it cannot be used for good the FBI is now admittedly recording internet
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:52.280]  talk radio programs all over the world and the United States to track people
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:55.840]  speech in the United States and they're openly calling for internet censorship
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:02.520]  high-tech street lights are listening to the public and tracking them in
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:10.400]  Homeland Security is also pushing plans for citizens to wear taser bracelets
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:15.360]  when you get on the plane number 11 Congress has been debating a new bill
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:18.080]  that would officially doesn't the United States part of the battleground the war
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.160]  on terror about the US military to arrest American citizens and older than
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:27.720]  definitely without trial and it goes on here with some of the other points but
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:35.080]  that's what's going on that's what's happening on that front
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:40.360]  let's go ahead and get to this piece and then I'll hit some financial news and
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:44.400]  take some more your calls ahead of our guest now this is Conan O'Brien last
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:51.640]  night I guess stories up at info wars comm making fun of Ron Paul and after
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:57.680]  we've played it I will give you my view on the piece but this is again all part
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:03.160]  of the demonization campaign that is taking place right now as they try to
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:07.320]  call Ron Paul extreme when he's actually the only person who's trying to be an
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.560]  American of any of these candidates from both parties let's go ahead and go to
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:16.840]  the club presidential candidate Ron Paul released a very aggressive campaign
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:22.000]  ad this week this is real it features guitar solos and even barking rot
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:27.880]  wireless it's unlike any presidential candidate a campaign I've ever seen
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.280]  before this ad as I say again this is not us this is a hundred percent real
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.240]  check it out what's up with these sorry politicians
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:41.560]  when it's showtime went for it like little ships you want big cuts Ron Paul's been
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:46.360]  screaming it for years budget crisis no problem got a trillion bucks year one
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.560]  that's trillion with a T it just keeps going and going and it's very like I've
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:53.840]  never seen one like that yeah yeah well apparently that ad was just the tip of
[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:57.760]  the iceberg check out Ron Paul's other new ad that was released just a couple
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:06.680]  of hours ago
[01:59:40.700 --> 02:16:51.680]  that's enough and then we we cut some of the mild profanity there on
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:55.640]  broadcast TV there if some people notice it a few seconds that was that was cut
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:17:01.000]  out on the internet we didn't but for radio stations we did look what's going
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.520]  on here is they're scared you notice naftan gas shut down the country you
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:10.880]  notice the roads are falling apart as the gas tax gets raised you notice there's
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:14.160]  never enough taxes there's never enough tickets written there's never enough
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:20.520]  fines and fees because 27 plus trillion 16 trillion everyone to foreign banks has
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:25.800]  been siphoned out by the New World Order banks that run this you need a department
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:29.040]  of health out there pushing deadly vaccines on people Department of
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:34.760]  Education federal control over education get us out of the UN at criminal
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:39.120]  organization the idea that all the bridges will be blown up you know I love
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:42.600]  when Ron Paul's on TV they'll say how we'll have no government if you get rid
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:45.520]  of the income tax in a lot of times he's standing in front of the Capitol and he
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:51.280]  says well we built this Capitol without income tax didn't have until 1913 the
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:55.600]  general public didn't pay until the 1950s it goes to pay the interest on the
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:58.760]  debt which is made up out of nothing because we shouldn't have to pay interest
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:04.720]  on US money it's now a Federal Reserve note so they play on the ignorance that
[02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:08.680]  you know Ron Paul saying you want cuts you'll get them as if any cuts are bad
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:13.120]  the government just grows by trillions a year it's they're devaluing the
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:18.280]  currency all of this is happening and they're acting like somebody trying to
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:22.760]  put the brakes on it as a crazy person and in Conan Bryant's like this is not
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:30.120]  a joke this is real someone actually wants cuts I mean this is terrible you
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:35.720]  know they show the government is a dog barking all bark no you know no bite you
[02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:40.000]  want cuts we'll give them to you I mean it was not a quote extreme ad we need
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.240]  extreme ads we need to shake people out of the transfer in we need to tell
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:49.560]  people the truth just right up front and what's really devastating them is the
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:52.960]  Newt Genrich ad that's why they ran that ad against him right there that made up
[02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:56.440]  ad that he didn't make the second one is because they're pointing out what Newt
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.440]  Genrich really stands for and that's the ringer they want they've had all these
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:04.360]  other ringers who come and go I talked to top Republicans who thought it was
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:10.200]  gonna be Rick Barry but we exposed him others exposed him and Ron Paul
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:14.040]  attacked him brought him down you gave Ron Paul the money to run the ads Ron
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:18.200]  Paul attacks Mitt Romney he starts going down he attacks Newt Genrich
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:23.240]  Genrich has lost in Iowa was 12 points at two days ago now it's 15 points and
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:30.040]  Ron Paul's now the leader there they are absolutely freaking out because Iowa is
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:34.080]  a caucus state where they're gonna raise their hands and they're gonna have real
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:39.560]  trouble in all those precincts covering that up and they're gonna try to steal
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:43.960]  New Hampshire other places but remember Ron Paul is now surging and if he gets
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:48.240]  such a big lead but he's 10 15 points ahead they won't be able to steal it
[02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:52.000]  from him then they'll go into the next game plan trying to politically
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.920]  assassinate his character but the system is discredited that'll backfire on

[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:31.400]  establishment globalist Republican to another all of them Mitt Romney Rick
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:36.880]  Perry Newt Gennrich they're the establishment candidates I mean compared
[02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:40.920]  to Bachman and others I mean Bachman you know is pro-war but not a globalist
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:45.080]  that's why they don't like her it's why they're not pushing her she's no Ron
[02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:47.680]  Paul but she's better than they are that's why she's demonized it's why
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:52.200]  she's attacked actually hear neocons every day when I spot check bad
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:58.880]  mouthing her just in case she surges they don't want that happening but you
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:03.480]  look at what's happening with Newt Gennrich and he's in the news saying I
[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.920]  went up in the polls and people ignore my checkered past because they know I'm
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:12.200]  so smart that's that little talking point he's so smart he's smart he'll fix
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:17.120]  things he'll figure it out and you see the population you know being taught
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:22.680]  you know he's a good guy he's a real conservative he'll beat Obama well if he
[02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:27.760]  did it wouldn't matter pro-war pro-secret arrest pro-police state pro-open
[02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:34.840]  borders pro-carbon tax pro-government health care I mean this is who he is and
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:41.040]  it's just like Obama supporters who thought he was gonna fix everything for
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.640]  them they really believe these politicians actually like them and want
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:50.440]  to help them the only person who actually votes like they say they will
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:56.320]  is Ron Paul and I'm not here selling Ron Paul for me it's a nauseating joke that
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:26:01.560]  he even has to be sold and I know that when loser draw the systems against him
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:05.400]  he's winning by getting the word out and you're winning when you spread the word
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:09.680]  because people discover liberty the opposite of what these other candidates
[02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:16.560]  are pushing but undoubtedly if Ron Paul was younger and could run again in four
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:21.720]  years he'd win I mean he had you know ten points or so before now he's got
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:26.640]  upwards of 30 he's winning and all over the country different polls imagine a
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:31.080]  few years from now people will really be awake to what he's saying but it'll be
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:35.000]  too late then but it won't matter that he's too old you got Rand Paul you've
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.800]  got the ideas of liberty that lives in all of you Ron Paul say it he's just a
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:48.880]  focal point for liberty but definitely we're we're in the fight right now the
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:54.320]  system is panicking panicking over it big time who's been holding the longest
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:58.360]  here let's go to a Clarence you know Oklahoma Clarence you're on the air
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:06.640]  welcome Jones God bless you and thank you for doing what you do and I just
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:13.720]  wanted to make three points I'm a Marine Corps veteran of 13 years and I'm just
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:19.000]  flabbergasted on what's going on right now I mean I woke up probably about
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:25.080]  three years ago and and wow it's crazy it's happening but the three points I'd
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:29.960]  like to make are you know use the billions out there that are listening
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:34.800]  to the show listen to Alex Jones it's time to get ready it's time to cowboy up
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:38.080]  it's time to talk to the service members talk to those peace officers talk to
[02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:41.200]  those sheriffs talk to those state legislators talk to those kind of
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:44.720]  commissioners and say hey what are we going to do to protect our free to
[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:49.440]  protect our liberty get those groups get organized come up with a plan with
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:52.800]  what you're gonna do you know and then the second thing I'd like to do is talk
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:55.880]  to my Marine Corps brothers out there those armed service members those
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:00.320]  sheriffs those peace officers are out there now risking their butts out there
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:03.960]  on the end of the line so I'll try to keep the family friendly here but I'm
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:09.080]  telling you it's time who what side are you gonna be on who are you gonna be
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:12.360]  with you're gonna be with your brothers and sisters that defend liberty do you
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:15.640]  remember that oath that you took to uphold and defend the Constitution of
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:19.800]  United States are you gonna do it and you older guys that are up there you
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:22.000]  need to start teaching those younger guys you got to let them know what's
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.160]  going on let them make that decision what side they're gonna be on you need to
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:28.760]  go out to those civilians you need to train them how to defend themselves how
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:32.840]  they need to get organized and what the things they need to do that's right you
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:37.080]  should be providing leadership to defend the Republic because just like in
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:40.360]  Europe there's no doubt banks have done this foreign banks have taken over
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:44.720]  they're attempting because they control the executive in most the states to
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:49.680]  carry this out but a lot of people say well I only care about the economy I
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:53.640]  don't care about my liberties there is never a good economy if there's not
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:58.560]  liberties people don't understand that liberty produces the good economy and
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:03.880]  notice as the liberties go the economy is going because the tyrants don't want
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:09.120]  a good economy that's the message that we've got to get out to people I got
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:12.440]  well I got one more thing and I'm gonna tell you globalist that are out there
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:15.000]  you're listening to me you zombies are out there listening that are gonna follow
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.920]  these orders and you're gonna do it I'm waiting on you because I'm mad at

[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:32.320]  gonna crush you you're gonna be beneath our feet I'm telling you there's
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:37.080]  nothing more powerful the world world and God in heaven and he's giving us
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:40.400]  those three things and we will fight and die for them I'm telling you right now
[02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:46.400]  you are nothing and we're on to you well amen to that good to hear from you God

[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:34.960]  what we've done I'm too busy running over globalist lies and crashing through
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:39.280]  their lies and disinformation to even look back it's like winning a race you

[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:35.080]  95 is the newest there's never really been a professional film and like a
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:40.480]  decade I mean my film road to tyranny spends some time on it 35 minutes or so
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:44.920]  40 minutes but this is with the survivors with the mother of Terrence
[02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:49.480]  Yeke the cop that saw this with the Hoppy Hoddleburg with the Jane Graham who
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:53.560]  was in Oklahoma City it was another false flag by the very same Justice
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:56.840]  Department people that are in control right now in a noble lie proves it and
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:00.720]  they're getting ready in all their hype to stage new Oklahoma cities and
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:04.820]  blaming on domestic groups by the way the Southern Parvy Law Center it was
[02:36:04.820 --> 02:36:08.080]  supposedly headed formats at Elohim City where McVeigh and others were
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:11.560]  interesting information on that front so that needs to be investigated further
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:19.840]  but a noble lie Oklahoma City 1995 it is available at info wars.com and those
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:23.680]  that don't know history are doomed to repeat it we also have outside the law
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:28.200]  stories from Guantanamo now you have the CBS headline American citizens to be
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:31.520]  sent to Guantanamo we have scientists under attack dealing with genetic
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:35.080]  engineering all the rest of it and we have the info wars black flag of non
[02:36:35.080 --> 02:36:41.480]  surrender so 3,000 year old flag the Greeks used it many others use the black
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:45.720]  flag and all over the world it means no surrender it became the pirate flag
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:49.120]  because when they ran a black flag up it meant we're gonna fight you to the end
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:52.800]  and if you don't surrender now we're gonna kill everybody well that's not
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:57.040]  what we're saying in the military now black flag just means we are not gonna
[02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:01.480]  surrender and so with that's why it's black flag with info wars.com across it
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:04.800]  great way to spread the word in your house outside your house your business
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:08.760]  whatever those are available for like 14 bucks and supports the cause at info

[02:37:33.880 --> 02:37:37.720]  prisonplanet.tv alright for the balance of the hour then I'll go a little bit
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:41.880]  overdrive and take calls Sheriff Richard Mack joins us via video Skype he lives
[02:37:41.880 --> 02:37:45.280]  out in Fredericksburg we got him on a short notice we couldn't drive him I
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:48.920]  look forward to having him in studio the next few weeks and back on the nightly
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.880]  news but he's the guy that took it to the Supreme Court the Brady Bill beat it a
[02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:56.800]  key 10th Amendment ruling saying the states have a right to say no to the
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:01.080]  feds we already knew that but it was important modern ruling Sheriff Mack
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:04.960]  comms his website and now he's goes all over the country and speaks to police
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:08.880]  and military and others about their constitutional duty especially the
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:14.440]  power of sheriffs the most powerful elected person in the county that's
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:18.440]  what's in the Constitution and the Southern Prairie Law Center in ADL we
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:22.400]  saw an ADL headline yesterday secret sheriffs meetings with ADL talk about
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.720]  small government terrorist and if you want small government you're a terrorist
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:30.960]  so the police are being brainwashed with just incredible cartoon level you
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:35.160]  see I've seen the training videos and training manuals you can't believe cops
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:38.680]  are nodding their head all George Washington is called a terrorist and
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:42.120]  scum I mean you're like it's red dawn there's the there's the there's the
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:47.720]  enemy right there you have the enemy of the Republic but but listen I talk like
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:52.040]  that but I never call for violence but clearly it's treason Sheriff Mack is
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:57.680]  very calm very gentlemanly that's why he's effective police really listen to
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:00.720]  him sheriff really listen to him and so the Southern Prairie Law Center keeps
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:04.560]  putting reports out you see him in dental offices they mail him to his two
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:08.600]  executives and professionals my dad gets sent it without ever asking it comes
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:14.360]  to him they're also running around in Austin the ADL some property law center
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:18.000]  you know promoting like a civil right to have the county pay for abortions with
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:23.040]  your tax money the point is they're in everybody's business and they came out
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:27.600]  and they said Sheriff Mack says kill police which is like saying Dudley do
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:31.920]  right says kill police and well he's gonna tell you the story right now but
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:41.440]  the article is up at info wars calm it's also posted right now at the new
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.480]  American calm William F. Jasper wrote the article SPLC admits lying about
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:52.280]  Sheriff Mack lawsuit pending he joins us via video Skype to break this down he
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.880]  tells the whole story he even sent me his proof the correspondence with the
[02:39:56.880 --> 02:40:03.320]  Southern Prairie Law Center I guess now squirming and not wanting to be sued
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:07.160]  because they are caught red-handed and this is standard procedure they just
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:11.880]  tell cops Ron Paul cop killers they they support cop killing and we've seen the
[02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:15.000]  training manual if you got a Ron Paul sticker on the car that may be a cop
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:18.720]  killer they said the same thing about Sheriff Mack and now when he tries to go
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:23.960]  talk to police they they're like are you the cop killer man so he joins us down
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.840]  to break this down Sheriff Mack good to have you thanks a lot Alex appreciate
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:34.280]  being able to talk about this this horrible situation that the SPLC is
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:39.800]  and ADL as you mentioned Ventura County Sheriff doing training with the ADL
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:45.080]  about against people who believe in the Constitution and limited government I
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:48.480]  don't see why that would be a threat that any police officer needs to learn
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:53.440]  about no and again it reads like a cartoon of your head screwed on straight
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:59.000]  but for them they they're really buying it so break it down for us and exactly
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.800]  what happened what they said about you and now they're quote retraction okay
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:09.080]  yeah I've been in touch with Mark Poltock you know him very well he's the
[02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:14.160]  director of the SPLC anytime the Southern Prairie Law Center is on
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:18.640]  television he's the one representing them and so they've been going after me
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:23.840]  ever since I did the Brady Bill fight that you just mentioned I did I started
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:30.520]  that in 1994 and they put me on there in their book that Morris these did
[02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:36.960]  immediately I was included in a book of dangerous patriot Americans currently
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:41.960]  I'm on their list number 18 of dangerous patriot Americans they continue that
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:47.360]  propaganda and isn't it amazing that if they would look at my career and go to
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:51.200]  the Provo Police Department and to the Sheriff's Office where I was the sheriff
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:55.840]  in Grand County, Arizona they would know that I've never committed an act of
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:00.920]  violence towards any human being in my life I've never slugged another person
[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:05.760]  I've never beat up another person I never shot anybody in my career I would
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:09.120]  have I would do those things if they were necessary but they're just not
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:14.360]  necessary and I'm a whore and I have whore and I'm appalled I should say
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:19.960]  about all the police news stories how they're smacing everybody and they're
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:24.080]  tasing everybody and they're shooting anybody that they want at the drop of a
[02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:28.000]  hat I hate those stories and I'm going to tell you right now they're just not
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.840]  necessary but here I start a career fighting the federal government and
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:37.240]  being an activist saying look don't you think we ought to follow the Constitution
[02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:41.760]  and just because you violate the Constitution doesn't mean I'm going to go
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:45.720]  along with you so that's why I went against the Brady Bill and so now all
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:50.280]  of a sudden I'm on the SPLC list and I never heard of these guys before in my
[02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:57.080]  life nor did they ever talk to me until May of 2011 they had a reporter call me
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:02.240]  while I'm touring and teaching classes to law enforcement and sheriffs and tea
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:06.200]  parties in Ohio now they call it a reporter because they've lost so much
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:10.840]  credibility they now have a little propagandist have a reporter call you up
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:15.040]  I had the media matters George Soros grip call me and and say they were a
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:18.200]  reporter and I was laughing and I said George Soros funds you and the guy said
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:22.080]  no he doesn't started laughing at me I mean these people are literally snake
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:26.400]  creatures but please continue well that is and that's exactly what these guys
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:32.560]  are snake hit man for the globalist and they say they watch hate groups but the
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:38.280]  SPLC is the biggest hate group I've ever known and they embrace Bill Ayers and
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:43.080]  yet they assail people like you and me who don't want any violence and we want
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:47.560]  government to just leave us alone and we want the Constitution followed and we
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:51.000]  quote the founding fathers so all of a sudden that makes us some sort of big
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:56.600]  threat to to to everybody and we're part of a hate group and we're bigots and
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:01.120]  we're racist well let me tell you right now when they called me my mom had just
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:05.400]  passed away and I told that reporter you guys claim that I'm a racist and a
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.160]  bigot let me tell you something about my mother she didn't raise racist and
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:14.120]  bigots in her home that was totally foreign to us and I am not anything you've
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:18.480]  said about me so I said look why should I talk to you guys you've lied about me
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:23.400]  for years you just recently lied about me in your magazine the intel report and
[02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:27.880]  he goes well how did we do that and I said you said that I believe in shooting
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:31.840]  and killing federal agents and federal police and I've never said anything like
[02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:35.680]  that in my life and he goes well I'm gonna have I'm gonna have this checked
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:41.080]  on so then the next day Mark Potok calls me himself and he said sheriff we owe
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:45.800]  you an apology and I said what I pinged on the phone I said is this really Mark
[02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:50.960]  Potok SPLC I said you guys lie all the time I don't trust you and you lie
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:57.320]  about all my friends and I named Ron Paul and and judge Napolitano and I said
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:03.920]  these guys aren't violent they don't hate anybody and you as you label them you
[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:08.720]  slander them you do it to me I said and I've had it this time and he goes well
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:13.920]  we we're gonna print a retraction because the tape that we have of you where we
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:18.320]  quote you saying that you didn't say that at all and I said that's what I tried
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:22.600]  to tell you and I said and I don't think it was an accident because you have the
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:27.560]  tape that is not an accident and I'll be happy to play that before the jury so
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:33.320]  then after that Mark Potok and I share emails and phone calls for the next
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:39.160]  maybe six seven eight weeks and finally I told him I said look I think we should
[02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:43.800]  handle this as gentlemen I do want a retraction and apology but you're also
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:48.760]  going to make amends for this not apology isn't enough and so I said I
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:54.480]  want a donation to the CSPO a because you send this to sheriffs and the CSPO a
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:58.180]  the constitutional sheriff and peace officer association I'm having a
[02:45:58.180 --> 02:46:02.400]  national meeting with these guys and they're now worried about what I am and
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:07.680]  now I'm also worried that if the federal government is going to come after me at
[02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:11.440]  least they should come after you and find the evidence that you have this says
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:17.960]  that I'm trying to kill agents and so we talk about that for a long time and I
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:23.120]  said one of my demands is this I want to speak to all your employees I said how
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:30.680]  many do you have 25 30 Alex they have a hundred and 75 employees at the SPLC and
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:35.400]  this is just an indication of how much money these people have and what kind of
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:39.040]  an organization they have and so I said I want to speak to everybody and they
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:43.440]  said no Joe Levin our lawyer says we're not going to let you do that and I said
[02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:46.560]  you know why you don't want to do that I said because you don't want your
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:51.040]  employees to quit and to realize that you guys have lied about me and lied
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:55.520]  about a lot of other good people and my only crime is that I called the founding
[02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:00.800]  fathers and that I want people to be left alone in this country and and then
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:05.560]  they said okay well I sent you the email where POTOC is whining and he goes
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:09.800]  okay we don't want to pay for you to come and talk to all our employees I
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:13.920]  said yeah I know why you don't want he said so we'll let you do it on Skype and
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:17.880]  I said how am I gonna know who he who's even there I said look I'm not doing it
[02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:21.920]  on Skype you were either doing it in person or we're not doing it and I said
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:26.080]  so then I didn't hear from them so I said look if you're not gonna settle with
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:30.600]  me out of court then I'm gonna sue you and I have a lawyer by the name of Jim
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:34.600]  Chapman and we're gonna sue the Southern Poverty Law Center and Alex I had it
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:39.320]  with him I'm tired of lying about people who I know are good honest American
[02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:45.440]  people like you I'm tired of lying about me and so is my wife well be careful
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:49.120]  because from my research into him I know you didn't really know who they were let
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:53.600]  me tell you they have this some serious people it's basically a branch from my
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:57.280]  research of the US government it's connected in with the Israelis and
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:48:02.920]  others and I mean they just run around demonizing anybody that doesn't want a
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:08.680]  new world order and but I'm glad you're doing it and you defeated the feds at
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:12.280]  the Supreme Court before and I hope they do the right thing because I've
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:19.000]  warned them before to stop implying I'm a racist and then I'm for violence in
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.640]  the southern and the ADL actually did pull some articles and actually did do
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:27.480]  some stuff with my lawyer similar about five years ago because they were just
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:32.120]  saying stuff that wasn't true and the police that are given this material
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:37.360]  their superiors are giving it to them so they believe it's true now I've seen
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:40.560]  some of the stuff you set up they've said about you I there's so discredited
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:43.800]  one reason I haven't gone after these grips is because there's such a joke in
[02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:47.880]  my view now you know ten years ago police really believed it now they now
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:53.640]  they take it with a grain of salt but what specifically was it in
[02:48:53.640 --> 02:49:00.200]  publications I mean they said you said kill cops yeah kill federal agents and
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:05.720]  then a sheriff in Carbon County Pennsylvania was asked about whether or
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:10.640]  not he was an oathkeeper and he brought my name up and he said well Sheriff
[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:15.400]  Matt believes in killing IRS agents just for coming on your property and he's
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:22.280]  like a Nazi and then I wrote him because that was on statewide TV in the
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:25.880]  Pennsylvania area so I told him I was going to sue him that was Sheriff
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:30.440]  Notstein and he just got reelected regrettably why don't you just add him
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:35.160]  on and yeah I might I might I might actually because but he is going to be
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:39.520]  my witness whether he likes it or not because he said well Sheriff Mack I
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:45.800]  apologize but I got this from the SPLC magazine he said they're the ones that
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:49.840]  said it I was just quoting them and I said well you're quoting a lie and you
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:53.160]  know what they say yeah but that's ridiculous I mean in times like this
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:57.280]  our rhetoric should be somewhat heightened but you're always very just
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:01.720]  Billarite Constitution very I mean it's just it's so ridiculous for people that
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:07.120]  know you they would make this stuff up I know he's been to my presentation he
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:11.400]  went to my presentation and he heard me say all those same things you just said
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:14.960]  that I'm peaceful and that this is a peaceful process and if we get sheriff's
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:19.680]  just to keep their oath of office and to follow the Constitution then we're
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:23.320]  going to protect people like we're supposed to and he's heard me say that
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:27.360]  and another sheriff in Pennsylvania called him on the carpet for said you
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:31.440]  were there with us Mack didn't say to kill anybody he says that we should
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:35.960]  protect our citizens from the IRS and other federal agencies but that's what
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:39.840]  we're supposed to do is by protect get them out of the jurisdiction but but
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:44.600]  but here's what's crazy the system can't have you out teaching the oath and the
[02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:49.960]  Billarites because that's what America is and these groups on every level want
[02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:55.000]  to get rid of what America is it's seditious and I'm glad I'm glad you're
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:59.160]  suing them it's got to be done this is a time to stand up to these people stay

[02:54:25.440 --> 02:54:30.160]  citizens the end deposit common taught us as you mentioned sheriff departments
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:35.160]  are now been caught we got the documents all over the country with the ADL and

[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:42.000]  wanting small governments now terrorism we got my act reports years ago
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:49.080]  Homeland Security demonizing Ron Paul and you know really again milk toast you
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:52.560]  know just constitutional nice friendly people like Pastor Chuck Baldwin
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:58.360]  Constitution Party presidential candidate they really really are scared
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:03.640]  I've noticed that the mild-mannered Clark Kent type guys are who they really hate
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:08.280]  because they know you're convincing people and destroying that image if
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:12.600]  anybody that wants freedom is some crazy bomb-throwing nut they're really really
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:16.960]  scared right now what's your view on the NDAA and all this tyranny moving so
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:24.360]  quick I was on judge the Palatano about the SB 1867 the NDAA and this is this
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:29.760]  is I can't believe that any even the moderate Republicans are coming close to
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:35.600]  allowing the president this kind of power this is so I mean this just
[02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:42.120]  vindicates everything that you have said on your show for years and I feel
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:46.840]  vindicated as well because I said this was coming and so many people are
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:50.960]  getting ready for this this is probably the scariest legislation since the
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:56.400]  Patriot Act I don't I don't and they go hand-in-hand as you well know but the
[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:00.440]  Republicans are proving that we've got to get everybody out of the house and
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:04.320]  that's why I need to tell you I'm actually running for US Congress in
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:08.400]  District 21 I've had it with Congress I've had it with the federal government
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:13.040]  I've had it with the SPLC and I'm not gonna stand by anymore and watch these
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:17.240]  crooks destroy America I'm getting more involved than I have been before by the
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:21.240]  way Lamar Smith claims he's this big conservative but he is a globalist
[02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:26.440]  tyrant lover he's and I think he's you're gonna give him a run for his
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:30.240]  money so people need to get geared up for that to support you on a run against
[02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:34.860]  a rhino slime bag and they're gonna be running on a Ron Paul type campaign for
[02:56:34.860 --> 02:56:39.960]  Liberty type platform so people need to visit your website give folks that it's
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:46.080]  sheriff mac.com right now it is I don't have I just have to file this Monday and

[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:54.240]  the sheriff mac.com I've got a new book out that's kind of coming out with my
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:59.520]  campaign called the magic of gun control and it's a it's a pure deal against what

[03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:47.360]  we've had these treasonous actions done is that you know developing on the
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:52.240]  protest that you yourself have done you know at the Capitol for the TSA and
[03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:58.640]  that debacle that happened earlier this year and by Wall Street is you know I
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:03.280]  really think and I you know I come to you with it just because of you know the
[03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:08.920]  amount of exposure you have is that you know somehow we organize and get
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:13.160]  together and decide one day you know right in the new year after all this is
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:18.640]  passed that we get together and send out a call to everybody to say on one day in
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:23.200]  January the third Sunday or Saturday of the month basically everyone shows up

[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:39.640]  there to get oxygen to the public to wake them up but again they're gonna roll
[03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:44.120]  this out as the economy collapses they had to get the legal justification to do
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:48.960]  it and then they're gonna sell it all with PR to set the precedent they're
