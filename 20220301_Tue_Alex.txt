[00:00.000 --> 00:17.280]  It's Tuesday, March 1st, the year is 2022, and the world is truly on the verge not just
[00:17.280 --> 00:26.480]  of a global planetary war, but we're already in the midst of a financial, planetary, designed
[00:26.480 --> 00:33.880]  implosion by a handful of private central banks that have issued quadrillions in fake
[00:33.880 --> 00:41.080]  currency to consolidate and buy up control of almost all resources in the world.
[00:41.080 --> 00:45.080]  They need global crises.
[00:45.080 --> 00:53.120]  They need excuses, smoke screens, for the events that are now already unfolding.
[00:53.120 --> 01:02.120]  If amongst it, the inflation moving towards hyperinflation and then the dreaded artificial
[01:02.120 --> 01:10.160]  stagflation where you have a depression in the production of goods and a depression in
[01:10.160 --> 01:19.640]  the general economy with its shrinking, while prices massively increase at the same time.
[01:19.640 --> 01:25.680]  It was thought to be impossible until the 1970s when the private Federal Reserve was
[01:25.680 --> 01:29.960]  actually able to artificially create it.
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.800]  Now moving on to Russia, pulling back in a real politic, Henry Kissinger worldview,
[01:35.800 --> 01:42.600]  that doesn't mean I agree with Henry Kissinger, I'm saying looking at it, for the prism of
[01:42.600 --> 01:45.080]  the sociopaths.
[01:45.080 --> 01:50.280]  Putin has been pushed into this with NATO expansion and with all these different world
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.080]  leaders and all the different TV and news programs and members of the House and members
[01:55.080 --> 02:02.960]  of the Senate and Joe Biden as a presidential candidate and Joe Biden as president saying
[02:02.960 --> 02:08.840]  Russia is evil, Putin is evil, he's a thug, he's a criminal, we're gonna crush him.
[02:08.840 --> 02:13.640]  We gotta fight him over there in Ukraine and fight him over there in Eastern Europe and
[02:13.640 --> 02:20.880]  the Balkans and the Baltic states instead of fighting him here in America and blaming
[02:20.880 --> 02:27.760]  every facet of American life and every problem that goes on in the country and every cultural
[02:27.760 --> 02:35.920]  struggle on Putin and that's not just done here, it's done around the world.
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.960]  Look at what just transpired in Canada in the last month where mainstream news and the
[02:40.960 --> 02:47.960]  government itself said with no evidence that Vladimir Putin and the Russians were controlling
[02:47.960 --> 02:53.320]  the truck drivers and if you go on Twitter or Instagram or even mainstream corporate
[02:53.320 --> 02:59.720]  news everywhere, they're saying arrest Alex Jones, arrest Roger Stone, arrest Donald Trump,
[02:59.720 --> 03:09.960]  they work for Putin and then they take the audio of Trump being sarcastic on a show last
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.800]  week about oh look how wonderful you know Putin is with his peacekeepers, he's gonna
[03:14.800 --> 03:20.400]  keep the peace and he's being completely sarcastic and went on to say Biden totally
[03:20.400 --> 03:28.560]  acted weak and precipitated this invasion with the horrible pullout in Afghanistan but
[03:28.560 --> 03:36.040]  they edited it and then put it on the nightly news and on other programs and on comedy shows
[03:36.040 --> 03:46.000]  deceiving the American people that Trump is supporting Putin's invasion of Ukraine.
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.400]  They are parlaying this global crisis into domestic control not just here, not just in
[03:52.400 --> 03:55.840]  Canada, not just in the UK, but all over Europe.
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.600]  The EU and Germany are announcing, we're gonna cover this next segment with myself
[03:59.600 --> 04:09.760]  and I'll destroy her, that the mere potential pre-crime of a thought crime like sharing
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.920]  an article from Russia, if you might do it well then you're gonna be shut down, you're
[04:15.920 --> 04:20.040]  gonna be censored and of course they didn't extend that to the ADL's list of everything
[04:20.040 --> 04:26.320]  else, don't criticize transgenderism in children, being pushed on children, don't criticize
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.960]  election fraud, don't criticize open borders, they're gonna use this conflict with Russia
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.960]  as the pretext to come after all their domestic opposition across the world with legislation
[04:38.960 --> 04:45.360]  to literally turn the world into a giant authoritarian gulag where you're arrested,
[04:45.360 --> 04:52.320]  disappeared, de-platformed, de-banked, if you even question any of the official orthodoxy.
[04:52.320 --> 04:59.320]  This is a horrible situation, we're all in, we'll be right back on the other side, infowars.com,
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.960]  tomorrow's news today.
[05:00.960 --> 05:06.920]  I've been on air more than 25 years and long before I started selling high quality vitamin

[06:16.480 --> 06:27.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:27.840 --> 06:35.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got to tell you that every day when I look at my news desk
[06:35.600 --> 06:40.680]  and all the stacks and all the stories, it's pretty overwhelming, pretty groundbreaking
[06:40.680 --> 06:46.840]  information we cover here at Info Wars, but it seems like every day it just keeps mounting
[06:46.840 --> 06:49.720]  and reaching new levels.
[06:49.720 --> 06:58.080]  From World War III to deadly vaccines, you can only get the truth right here at infowars.com
[06:58.080 --> 07:01.400]  and band.video.
[07:01.400 --> 07:05.600]  An incredible time to be alive, an incredible time to be a part of this great team here
[07:05.600 --> 07:11.560]  at Info Wars, all built by you and the audience and Alex Jones telling the truth for years
[07:11.560 --> 07:17.040]  and now the saying Alex Jones was right is a household clichÃ©.
[07:17.040 --> 07:22.080]  Well, Alex is trying to take some time off, but how can you with World War III and deadly
[07:22.080 --> 07:29.480]  vaccines poisoning our planet, he's on the phone with me now, Alex, where do you want
[07:29.480 --> 07:30.480]  to begin?
[07:30.480 --> 07:34.720]  We've got huge news coming out of Ukraine, we've got huge news coming out today about
[07:34.720 --> 07:38.880]  the vaccines that they're trying to cover up, all of this ahead of the State of the Union
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.800]  address tonight, which I mean, is Biden even going to be able to make it?
[07:42.800 --> 07:46.600]  Has he had a public appearance that hasn't been a fumbling, bumbling embarrassment?
[07:46.600 --> 07:51.400]  Alex Jones on the phone line, what's the top story for you today, Alex?
[07:51.400 --> 07:55.760]  Well, that's right, a lot of people are going to ask me, what are you doing taking a few
[07:55.760 --> 08:02.800]  days off in the middle of this war and I promised my daughter and I promised others that I was
[08:02.800 --> 08:07.520]  going to take at least some time off because I've been working 15, 16, 18 hours a day,
[08:07.520 --> 08:13.600]  I'm not complaining, it's gotten so intense that I've hit basically burnout and when that
[08:13.600 --> 08:18.920]  happens, I've got to at least disconnect some and go out of town or again, I've been working
[08:18.920 --> 08:25.240]  upwards of 20 hours a day, Saturday and Sunday or 20 hours, at least each day, so it's about
[08:25.240 --> 08:26.240]  that.
[08:26.240 --> 08:30.600]  And so before I have a breakdown, I just had to go ahead and go forward with this trip
[08:30.600 --> 08:35.480]  that was already planned over a month ago, so here we are, ladies and gentlemen, a lot's
[08:35.480 --> 08:39.560]  going on, a lot's happening, all of you are going to be doing a great job, along with
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.360]  the rest of the amazing crew and our guests and everybody else, but let me just get this
[08:44.360 --> 08:45.760]  out here.
[08:45.760 --> 08:50.880]  We need the 35,000 foot view on all of this and understand that the globalists started
[08:50.880 --> 08:56.040]  the war with Russia, the globalists, so we got to fight them over there and not hear
[08:56.040 --> 09:02.920]  the globalists invaded all of these countries in the last 20 plus years on the most flimsy
[09:02.920 --> 09:09.360]  of pretext and now they're moving weapons up to the Russian border and so what else
[09:09.360 --> 09:10.360]  was Putin going to do?
[09:10.360 --> 09:13.960]  And I want to be clear, I'm not a Putinite, I'm not a Russophile, I've never been to
[09:13.960 --> 09:18.120]  Russia but I have studied the history and I don't like what Putin's done, I think he's
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.120]  miscalculated.
[09:19.120 --> 09:24.200]  I think this war is terrible, I'm a known anti-war person, I've been against every single one
[09:24.200 --> 09:30.600]  of these wars, Gulf War I, Gulf War II, the bombing of Serbia and Belgrade that happened
[09:30.600 --> 09:36.360]  twice with the Clintons, for like a month bombing them with DU bombs, blowing up hundreds
[09:36.360 --> 09:43.320]  of buildings, a thousand total, but hundreds of big ones killing tens of thousands of people.
[09:43.320 --> 09:48.480]  This is the reality of what's been going on and I've been against all those wars right
[09:48.480 --> 09:54.720]  through today and I'm against what Putin's done as well but this is designed by the social
[09:54.720 --> 09:59.800]  engineers to make us choose the side and so they can also bring an incredible authoritarian
[09:59.800 --> 10:06.400]  censorship in Europe, Australia, the US, Canada and the legislation's introduced in
[10:06.400 --> 10:13.080]  Europe, the EU saying they may do it without even having a law passed to not just ban RT
[10:13.080 --> 10:18.400]  and spot in a tough TV on the internet and block it in Europe but now to block and censor
[10:18.400 --> 10:25.240]  anybody that shares it and that is just insane, I share stuff that Kim Jong-un says and the
[10:25.240 --> 10:26.240]  G.G.
[10:26.240 --> 10:30.680]  Ping says I don't like them, I see them as major threats but the bigger threat is the
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.120]  people running us and controlling us, they're starting all these wars that are openly trying
[10:35.120 --> 10:42.800]  to train us and condition us to accept authoritarianism and so any authoritarianism of Putin is
[10:42.800 --> 10:48.480]  nothing when his economy is not very big, he's not a very big population, he's the
[10:48.480 --> 10:53.720]  biggest country in the world, they do have nuclear weapons but I don't believe he's
[10:53.720 --> 10:58.720]  going to expand throughout all of Ukraine, I think he doesn't want Ukraine, does he
[10:58.720 --> 11:02.440]  can't hold Ukraine, he does want to have a new government put in, probably a puppet
[11:02.440 --> 11:07.400]  government to replace the West, the puppet government but we have to understand the byproduct
[11:07.400 --> 11:13.360]  of this is the control and the witch hunts and the attacks on our freedom here with
[11:13.360 --> 11:17.760]  part three of the whole Russia gay hoax where anybody that opposes globalist policies must
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.680]  be a Putin agent, like they blame the truckers in the last month saying they're Putin agents
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.560]  with no evidence and the bigger piece of that internationally is China openly saying they're
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.960]  getting ready to go into Taiwan, the head of their navy, threatening the US to blow
[11:32.960 --> 11:39.360]  us up or chop our fingers off is the quote basically, he says we'll get burned or cut
[11:39.360 --> 11:47.400]  our fingers off, except he's bloody nose in their parlance if we get involved and so
[11:47.400 --> 11:52.080]  the globalists are smart on the top, they have incompetence as the managers that they
[11:52.080 --> 11:55.880]  controls, they can burn them or blame them when they want, the State Department is literally
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.920]  a bunch of drug addict, pedophile, trash, I know folks that have guarded them all over
[11:59.920 --> 12:04.760]  the world, two thirds of them are on a bunch of psychotropic drugs and other drugs, completely
[12:04.760 --> 12:10.760]  out of their minds, but the globalist above them destroyed Trump's plan to leave Afghanistan
[12:10.760 --> 12:15.720]  and have it be a good exit to entice Russia and others to make their moves because the
[12:15.720 --> 12:20.400]  globalists want the destabilization, they want part two of the great reset, they want
[12:20.400 --> 12:26.800]  economies to collapse, they want currencies, the spiral out of control and media value
[12:26.800 --> 12:30.760]  because at that international level, again, they want the post-industrial world.
[12:30.760 --> 12:34.840]  So I've been saying for two years, after the whole virus scare, there'll be war, there'll
[12:34.840 --> 12:38.720]  be cyber attack, there'll be power outages, I've been like a parrot saying it, I don't
[12:38.720 --> 12:43.680]  just make a bunch of predictions folks, I make specific predictions, the same one's
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.840]  over and over again, so we have it on record when it comes true and how do I know all this?
[12:48.840 --> 12:53.280]  How do I know war is next, how do I know devaluation of currencies next, how do I know famines
[12:53.280 --> 12:59.920]  next because it's in the playbook of Operation Lockstep and the Club of Rome and the CFR
[12:59.920 --> 13:03.880]  and the World Trade Organization and the IMF and the World Bank and the International
[13:03.880 --> 13:10.200]  Bank of Settlements, all I do, all I do is read their documents and then I'm totally
[13:10.200 --> 13:14.400]  frustrated with talk shows, it's hard to even get to it all, but people are finally discovering
[13:14.400 --> 13:19.320]  these clips, they're discovering these conferences, they're discovering the webs of connections,
[13:19.320 --> 13:25.680]  they're discovering how the World Economic Forum is the organizational mouthpiece of
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.160]  this system and people are discovering that these global elites are out to get the Russians,
[13:30.160 --> 13:33.560]  they're out to get the Chinese, they're out to get the Americans, they're out to get the
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.560]  Mexicans, they're out to get the Canadians, they're out to get the Brazilians, they're
[13:36.560 --> 13:43.040]  out to get the Japanese, they're out to get everybody, our children, their future, they
[13:43.040 --> 13:49.680]  quote post-human, post-industrial world, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, looking forward
[13:49.680 --> 13:51.480]  to the end of humanity.
[13:51.480 --> 13:57.400]  This is a transhumanist, anti-human cult, they're probably run by aliens, I don't know
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.200]  that, I don't speculate, I just know they talk like collaborators that have made a deal
[14:01.200 --> 14:05.680]  with some type of off-world operation to literally terraform the planet where humans can't live
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.920]  on it, take everything over and tell us that the end of humanity is here.
[14:10.920 --> 14:16.360]  So that's the big picture, and I'm not enemies of all the stupid left, and all the right
[14:16.360 --> 14:21.880]  wing fools that are neocons and people, they're just minions of the system that choose a side
[14:21.880 --> 14:26.840]  and try to be powerful within the system, but when the system itself is trying to destroy
[14:26.840 --> 14:30.400]  you, you've got to simply pull out of the system and build a new one.
[14:30.400 --> 14:34.040]  And so that's the reality here today, oh, I know you've got a lot to cover and a lot
[14:34.040 --> 14:39.800]  to go over, but they always cover up one crisis, and one thing they've done with the bigger
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.520]  crisis, and we've been asking the question for two years, as it comes out that this virus
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.400]  was made in the lab, which is confirmed now, as it comes out, they released it on purpose,
[14:48.400 --> 14:51.520]  as it comes out that they launched all these attacks, as it comes out that the vaccine
[14:51.520 --> 14:54.960]  is in the vaccine, the deadly gene therapy, the race of your immune system, it gives you
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.320]  cancer and blood clots, they would have a new, bigger crisis to turn the page.
[15:00.320 --> 15:09.040]  I said that probably a thousand times in the last 700 days or so, 800 days since this started,
[15:09.040 --> 15:13.480]  and now here we are with the next chapter, the war.
[15:13.480 --> 15:14.800]  And they greenlit publicly.
[15:14.800 --> 15:20.200]  We don't know there were secret meetings with Putin and Klaus Schwab in Kissinger, but you
[15:20.200 --> 15:24.320]  can see it telegraphed to the Chinese and the Russians that, hey, the globalists want
[15:24.320 --> 15:29.280]  a war, they want a new diversion, they want a new cover story for massive monetization,
[15:29.280 --> 15:33.000]  massive money printing, and crackdowns on freedom worldwide.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.400]  It helps all these governments, the virus helped all these governments power grab.
[15:36.400 --> 15:40.720]  The virus was just the beginning, now war helps all the governments power grab, whether
[15:40.720 --> 15:45.040]  it's Chinese, Russian, US, Canadian, it doesn't matter.
[15:45.040 --> 15:49.680]  And so they telegraphed to Putin that he could invade, Biden said, just don't take
[15:49.680 --> 15:51.880]  the whole country and we won't respond.
[15:51.880 --> 15:57.680]  And so he invaded, and that's because the deal was made publicly in front of everyone
[15:57.680 --> 16:06.320]  and it's just two life changing, life empowering products are now back in stock after being
[16:06.320 --> 16:10.400]  sold out for months at infowarstore.com.

[16:35.400 --> 16:39.720]  that is a compliment to brain force plus and of course turbo force.

[16:43.800 --> 16:47.120]  take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.

[16:56.400 --> 16:57.400]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[16:57.400 --> 17:07.480]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[17:07.480 --> 17:13.600]  until the populations rebelled, they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[17:13.600 --> 17:19.160]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.640]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[17:24.640 --> 17:30.320]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[17:30.320 --> 17:36.800]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[17:36.800 --> 17:37.800]  than ever.
[17:37.800 --> 17:42.280]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[17:42.280 --> 17:48.680]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[17:48.680 --> 17:51.040]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[17:51.040 --> 17:57.160]  So pray for these folks big time, it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowarstore.com
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.160]  because truth is absolutely paramount.
[17:59.160 --> 18:02.520]  With the world awakening, I think it was important that we were right to prevent them right
[18:02.520 --> 18:07.000]  now, take advantage of this moment and I have an idea of what everybody can do, what every
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  listener can do.
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.440]  I think it would be powerful and effective for us to hang the banners over highways, imagine
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.280]  a champagne or a piece of a layout made up that says Alex Jones is right, infowarstore.com
[18:17.280 --> 18:24.320]  brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this, yes, now is the time in your small
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.600]  town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your
[18:28.600 --> 18:33.800]  car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction.
[18:33.800 --> 18:35.840]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[18:35.840 --> 18:36.840]  I have a few ideas.
[18:36.840 --> 18:42.000]  First of all, help just as much as possible to form a rest out, rest out, swap, the vaccine
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  is poison.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  There's tons of things.
[18:44.000 --> 18:45.000]  I say to keep it short, keep it concise.
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.800]  No, I agree, arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison, beautiful.
[18:49.800 --> 18:53.520]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected, so that's what
[18:53.520 --> 18:54.520]  I'm calling about.
[18:54.520 --> 18:55.520]  God bless you Chris.
[18:55.520 --> 18:58.680]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.680]  Thank you so much.
[19:02.680 --> 19:04.680]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[19:04.680 --> 19:06.200]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[19:06.200 --> 19:07.200]  The bug.
[19:07.200 --> 19:08.200]  Great last caller.
[19:08.200 --> 19:11.800]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements, it's basically the only
[19:11.800 --> 19:16.000]  way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.680]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[19:18.680 --> 19:20.240]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[19:20.240 --> 19:21.600]  Eric, thanks for calling, go ahead.
[19:21.600 --> 19:23.200]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[19:23.200 --> 19:26.240]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[19:26.240 --> 19:27.880]  The X2 does wonders.
[19:27.880 --> 19:29.040]  They recommend it to everybody.
[19:29.040 --> 19:30.240]  You're on the fence about it.
[19:30.240 --> 19:33.160]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info board.
[19:33.160 --> 19:35.120]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[19:35.120 --> 19:36.120]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[19:36.120 --> 19:37.640]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[19:37.640 --> 19:38.640]  It's an honor.
[19:38.640 --> 19:39.640]  Honored to talk to you.
[19:39.640 --> 19:40.640]  Awesome.
[19:40.640 --> 19:46.040]  The first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29, if
[19:46.040 --> 19:49.920]  you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps with the bedroom.
[19:49.920 --> 19:51.720]  So just number one for a few of you.
[19:51.720 --> 19:54.360]  I like that one, it works, it's not a joke.
[19:54.360 --> 19:55.360]  Absolutely.
[19:55.360 --> 20:24.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, do not take these transmissions
[20:24.360 --> 20:26.280]  for granted.
[20:26.280 --> 20:35.840]  You see the state of the world, you see the state of our politics and you have to understand
[20:35.840 --> 20:40.320]  the globalist, the world economic forum are going for broke.
[20:40.320 --> 20:44.480]  And for them now to say, you're not even allowed to hear from Russia, you're not only allowed
[20:44.480 --> 20:47.960]  to hear from Russian ambassadors, you're not allowed to hear from Russian media, you're
[20:47.960 --> 20:53.880]  not allowed to hear from Putin, that is a dangerous concept and it means they're coming
[20:53.880 --> 20:56.640]  for us and you next.
[20:56.640 --> 21:01.480]  Whether you like Putin or hate him, you want to know what he's thinking, what he's saying
[21:01.480 --> 21:04.800]  in these important times and now they're trying to shut that down.
[21:04.800 --> 21:11.600]  So Alex, I mean this just shows the digital communication gulags are a huge threat to
[21:11.600 --> 21:16.640]  humanity and they're obviously afraid of whatever Putin is doing and saying because
[21:16.640 --> 21:22.280]  they don't want the world to know it as he's going deeper into Ukraine.
[21:22.280 --> 21:23.280]  Well that's right.
[21:23.280 --> 21:27.560]  I want to be very, very clear about this, just pull back and say, let's be neutral
[21:27.560 --> 21:31.840]  on Putin, let's be neutral on the US, let's be neutral on Ukraine and just look at the
[21:31.840 --> 21:32.840]  facts.
[21:32.840 --> 21:37.600]  That's been a proxy war for eight years that George Soros brags, you overthrew it and that
[21:37.600 --> 21:43.480]  then Russia invaded and took over several large areas of the country in the east and
[21:43.480 --> 21:50.160]  the south for the last several years, what is it now, seven, eight years.
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.800]  And so that's been unfolding for that long.
[21:52.800 --> 21:57.640]  And so why did this happen suddenly now that Trump leaves office and then comes by, well
[21:57.640 --> 22:01.760]  we know on record, the State Department's had to confirm this.
[22:01.760 --> 22:08.080]  Trump just told Putin, I'll bomb Moscow if you attack Kiev.
[22:08.080 --> 22:11.480]  And he also told Xi Jinping to his face, if you go into Taiwan, we will go to the nuclear
[22:11.480 --> 22:12.480]  war.
[22:12.480 --> 22:17.080]  He told Kim Jong-un that as well, if he kept firing the missiles, we were going to nuke
[22:17.080 --> 22:19.560]  them, he set it on TV, fired fury.
[22:19.560 --> 22:22.200]  And so that's the truth.
[22:22.200 --> 22:26.440]  And now the globalists with their puppet Biden said, no, just go ahead and take part
[22:26.440 --> 22:27.440]  of the country.
[22:27.440 --> 22:30.200]  Just don't take it all and we're not going to militarily counter you.
[22:30.200 --> 22:32.160]  That then got Putin to commit.
[22:32.160 --> 22:38.480]  Now that Putin's committed and moved to the country, the left is all we need to have Ukraine
[22:38.480 --> 22:39.480]  join the Euro.
[22:39.480 --> 22:44.280]  We need to have Ukraine join NATO right now, which would be a total act of war with Russia.
[22:44.280 --> 22:49.680]  So again, they wanted to create this crisis so they could play it out and use it for a
[22:49.680 --> 22:55.960]  long time and as a pretext for domestic crackdowns all over the Western world and to silence
[22:55.960 --> 22:56.960]  their opposition.
[22:56.960 --> 23:01.680]  So the EU has announced, the UK is announcing Australia, Canada, and it's all over the news
[23:01.680 --> 23:06.200]  here that now we've got a crackdown on disinformation.
[23:06.200 --> 23:13.280]  Anybody that questions the official narrative from NATO on Russia, and that is so incredibly
[23:13.280 --> 23:14.280]  dangerous.
[23:14.280 --> 23:19.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, so let me read to you just one example of what's going on.
[23:19.520 --> 23:25.040]  Here's a story that is on infowars.com.
[23:25.040 --> 23:32.040]  It's titled Canadian Bill with Banned Suspected Intent to Commit Hate Speech Online.
[23:32.040 --> 23:35.440]  No, this is a minority report with Tom Cruise.
[23:35.440 --> 23:41.520]  They're saying if AI thinks you might engage in hate speech, which you get just a few years
[23:41.520 --> 23:45.760]  ago wasn't the law in Canada, but now if you criticize a group or say you don't like communism
[23:45.760 --> 23:52.400]  or say that you're concerned about Klaus Schwab, even members of parliament are shut
[23:52.400 --> 23:56.840]  down in the Canadian parliament when they bring up quote, hate speech, which is always
[23:56.840 --> 24:02.200]  being expanded to everything you can imagine, not just the OK sign, but now Hong Kong is
[24:02.200 --> 24:04.320]  how Hitler and people need to be arrested.
[24:04.320 --> 24:09.360]  Now the Canadian flag is Hitler, now not wearing a mask is Hitler, and people say this doesn't
[24:09.360 --> 24:10.360]  make sense.
[24:10.360 --> 24:11.360]  It's crazy.
[24:11.360 --> 24:12.360]  No, no, no, no.
[24:12.360 --> 24:17.040]  It's the enemy on whatever thing it is they're power grabbing, whatever it is they're taking
[24:17.040 --> 24:18.040]  from you.
[24:18.040 --> 24:21.720]  And then you point out, well, wait a minute, so many of these people are the grandkids
[24:21.720 --> 24:28.280]  of real Nazis, Klaus Schwab and Kristia Freeland and all the rest of them, and oh, that's hate
[24:28.280 --> 24:29.280]  speech too.
[24:29.280 --> 24:30.680]  That's Hitler too.
[24:30.680 --> 24:35.960]  And then Putin actually says, well, a lot of the Western Ukrainians are Nazis, and they
[24:35.960 --> 24:38.280]  actually are leftovers from a Nazi party.
[24:38.280 --> 24:40.320]  Oh, that's horrible, says the ADL.
[24:40.320 --> 24:43.600]  You're not supposed to say that, even though it's true.
[24:43.600 --> 24:45.000]  So that's the reality.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.600]  Don't call a real Nazi like Soros or some of the Western Ukrainians a Nazi, or you'll
[24:49.600 --> 24:51.360]  get censored, you'll get in trouble.
[24:51.360 --> 24:52.360]  This is the new tyranny.
[24:52.360 --> 24:58.560]  When you read this article on Infowars.com, with a straight face, for those of this legislation
[24:58.560 --> 25:04.720]  to preemptively take everybody off the Internet and ban people and create an Internet ID system
[25:04.720 --> 25:09.360]  able to go online, that's what the Communist Chinese have tried to put in place.
[25:09.360 --> 25:12.080]  This is all part of the global social credit score.
[25:12.080 --> 25:14.760]  It's all part of the control grid, and it's not coming.
[25:14.760 --> 25:15.760]  It's here.
[25:15.760 --> 25:18.760]  And Canada is the beta test for what they want to roll out worldwide.
[25:18.760 --> 25:24.600]  So is Australia, where they also pass in an emergency session legislation to preemptively
[25:24.600 --> 25:27.000]  stop people criticizing lockdowns.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.760]  And what did Biden put in his national terrorism directive of June of last year, that questioning
[25:31.760 --> 25:37.360]  lockdowns is white supremism, white supremism is terror.
[25:37.360 --> 25:38.360]  Now that makes no sense.
[25:38.360 --> 25:44.480]  It's like saying a banana is a spaceship, or a potato is a rocket launcher, or a gun
[25:44.480 --> 25:46.200]  is a sandwich.
[25:46.200 --> 25:49.720]  It doesn't matter because this is their authoritarianism.
[25:49.720 --> 25:50.880]  This is their program.
[25:50.880 --> 25:56.760]  And they're attacking free, innocent, hardworking, good people of the West, the globalist are.
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.200]  So they must have something that makes us all suspect so we can all be bad and be the
[26:01.200 --> 26:02.200]  terrorists.
[26:02.200 --> 26:03.600]  So now we all may have the deadly virus.
[26:03.600 --> 26:05.560]  Now we all may be a white supremist.
[26:05.560 --> 26:08.000]  Now we all may be a Russian agent.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.120]  And this is how they're closing in on us ahead of the total financial collapse and the universal
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.600]  basic income, which will be just enough to live, but you must then follow every order
[26:17.600 --> 26:20.680]  they say and be tracked in live time by your smartphone.
[26:20.680 --> 26:23.120]  That's just phase one, phase two and plow the microchip.
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.800]  This is all officially announced by Klaus Schwab.
[26:26.800 --> 26:31.080]  So in closing, I'm going to hand the baton to Alan Schreuer.
[26:31.080 --> 26:33.480]  We are in a battle with the globalist at point blank range.
[26:33.480 --> 26:34.680]  We're winning.
[26:34.680 --> 26:37.920]  People are seeing through their garbage, their whole vaccine rollout.
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.360]  Their whole COVID power grab blew up in their face.
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.280]  This whole Ukraine thing is blowing up in their face on both sides and Putin's face
[26:45.280 --> 26:49.920]  and the globalist sides and competency of these governments is coming out.
[26:49.920 --> 26:51.680]  And we need to stay on air now more than ever.
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.400]  So people are ready for the truth listeners, but we need the financing to stay on air.
[26:55.400 --> 26:57.160]  Plus we have great products.
[26:57.160 --> 26:59.200]  Everybody needs, so folks don't procrastinate.
[26:59.200 --> 27:00.840]  Go to info or store.com today.
[27:00.840 --> 27:04.840]  I've extended X3 with all three of the good types of iodine for your immune system and
[27:04.840 --> 27:05.840]  your body.
[27:05.840 --> 27:09.600]  It is 50% off because I just got to get the money in.
[27:09.600 --> 27:10.600]  It's 50% off.
[27:10.600 --> 27:13.000]  I've been saying that for at least a few more days.
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.360]  Winter sun 50% off, brain force ultra 50% off.
[27:17.360 --> 27:20.200]  They are all at info or store.com.
[27:20.200 --> 27:26.200]  The flash sale for a turbo force 50% off will end today because we're only down to a few
[27:26.200 --> 27:30.640]  thousand packages of that and more isn't coming in at least until August of this year because
[27:30.640 --> 27:31.800]  of supply chain break now.
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.600]  So get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get your storeable food is ready to ship to
[27:35.600 --> 27:36.600]  you.
[27:36.600 --> 27:39.600]  This crazy world folks, that's how you beat inflation is get storeable food because then
[27:39.600 --> 27:43.160]  you can eat the storeable food later that tastes really good and nutritious that you
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.160]  bought at a lower price.
[27:44.160 --> 27:47.160]  That's one of the few ways you can actually beat inflation.
[27:47.160 --> 27:48.720]  It's even better than real estate.
[27:48.720 --> 27:55.200]  So info or store.com or triple A 253-31-39 and oh and I hope when you come back you'll
[27:55.200 --> 27:56.600]  actually read this article on air.
[27:56.600 --> 28:01.160]  I know you've got a lot to cover, but people need to see the thought crime law they're
[28:01.160 --> 28:06.520]  trying to pass in Canada that is beyond even North Korea or communist China where AI watches
[28:06.520 --> 28:13.080]  you in live time and simsters you in blockchain before you even post because of an algorithm
[28:13.080 --> 28:15.360]  it has of who you are and what you're doing.
[28:15.360 --> 28:17.400]  This is beyond science fiction.
[28:17.400 --> 28:21.960]  This is actually happening so everybody will keep us on air at info or store.com.
[28:21.960 --> 28:29.560]  People can also call toll free and we're over the phone, triple A 253-31-39, triple A 253-31-39.
[28:29.560 --> 28:32.720]  We have still an underage.
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.920]  We are still in the red right now that we've dug out of the hole some thanks for all your
[28:36.920 --> 28:37.920]  help.
[28:37.920 --> 28:39.840]  We do not want info wars to have to cut people back.
[28:39.840 --> 28:44.280]  We do not want info wars to have to declare some type of limited bankruptcy.
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.080]  We really need all of your support, ladies and gentlemen, to keep them for wars on the
[28:48.080 --> 28:49.080]  air.
[28:49.080 --> 28:50.080]  So God bless.
[28:50.080 --> 28:51.080]  I'm going to hand a baton to Owen Schreuer.
[28:51.080 --> 28:53.200]  Remember, if you don't share the articles, nobody will.
[28:53.200 --> 28:54.720]  If you don't speak up, nobody will.
[28:54.720 --> 28:57.000]  If you don't pray for awakening, nobody will.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.880]  I don't want Schreuer to lie about this.
[29:00.880 --> 29:06.280]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're
[29:06.280 --> 29:07.720]  going to be happy with.
[29:07.720 --> 29:10.640]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[29:10.640 --> 29:12.320]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[29:12.320 --> 29:13.400]  I promote liberty.
[29:13.400 --> 29:14.480]  I promote freedom.
[29:14.480 --> 29:18.400]  I fight the globalist and I'm able to do that because you buy products and info wars
[29:18.400 --> 29:19.400]  store.com.
[29:19.400 --> 29:21.000]  And listen, all the products are great.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.120]  But when it comes to high quality, storeable food in an inflationary system with major
[29:26.120 --> 29:31.720]  supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win and no brainer.
[29:31.720 --> 29:34.800]  And they've got high quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right now.
[29:34.800 --> 29:39.960]  The great folks at my paper supply exclusively prepare with alex.com discounted.
[29:39.960 --> 29:43.280]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the info war.
[29:43.280 --> 29:49.440]  The only way you lose is not taking action at infowarstore.com or prepare with alex.com
[29:49.440 --> 29:50.440]  right now.
[29:50.440 --> 29:51.640]  This is high quality, storeable food.
[29:51.640 --> 29:53.720]  This is how you beat inflation.
[29:53.720 --> 29:54.720]  Get yours today.
[29:54.720 --> 29:57.880]  It's a great partnership, but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because
[29:57.880 --> 30:00.040]  inflation is exploding.
[30:00.040 --> 30:01.600]  Sold out for months.
[30:01.600 --> 30:04.240]  X3 is now back in stock.
[30:04.240 --> 30:08.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[30:08.080 --> 30:11.600]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[30:11.600 --> 30:13.640]  It's not the soil anymore.
[30:13.640 --> 30:19.320]  Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality tri iodine, all three
[30:19.320 --> 30:24.400]  of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but
[30:24.400 --> 30:26.120]  most importantly, your immune system.
[30:26.120 --> 30:32.560]  So X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available
[30:32.560 --> 30:36.240]  again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[30:36.240 --> 30:40.080]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[30:40.080 --> 30:44.440]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[30:44.440 --> 30:47.240]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[30:47.240 --> 30:51.280]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[30:51.280 --> 30:54.720]  what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds
[30:54.720 --> 30:57.000]  the info war, a true 360 win.
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.720]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[31:00.720 --> 31:02.640]  So I did it.
[31:02.640 --> 31:04.800]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[31:04.800 --> 31:09.480]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[31:09.480 --> 31:11.480]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[31:11.480 --> 31:17.560]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[31:17.560 --> 31:18.560]  to get going.
[31:18.560 --> 31:24.040]  Besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep
[31:24.040 --> 31:29.200]  me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving
[31:29.200 --> 31:31.840]  me the best chance at getting through the training.
[31:31.840 --> 31:35.480]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[31:35.480 --> 31:37.800]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[31:37.800 --> 31:42.440]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[31:42.440 --> 31:44.840]  support and extra flexibility.
[31:44.840 --> 31:49.440]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[31:49.440 --> 31:54.120]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force that can
[31:54.120 --> 31:58.200]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[31:58.200 --> 32:01.280]  moving and feeling great at any age.

[32:28.480 --> 32:33.240]  which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian
[32:33.240 --> 32:38.640]  tribes for centuries, Alpha GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers
[32:38.640 --> 32:44.360]  an essential nutrient, Koleam and Ginkgoleam which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant
[32:44.360 --> 32:45.360]  content.
[32:45.360 --> 32:49.400]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well so you know
[32:49.400 --> 32:51.520]  it's packed full of the good stuff.
[32:51.520 --> 32:57.040]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it is completely
[32:57.040 --> 33:01.880]  sold out at M4store.com.
[33:01.880 --> 33:13.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.480 --> 33:20.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer, you're listening to the
[33:20.320 --> 33:32.440]  Alex Jones show.
[33:32.440 --> 34:02.360]  I just look at all this news on my desk and if you guys give me a dot cam, every single
[34:02.360 --> 34:13.300]  but not just every single article that I have in front of me, do I have deep important commentary
[34:13.300 --> 34:26.560]  to get into, each one of these stacks that all ties together will frame where we're at
[34:26.560 --> 34:33.840]  now as humans on this planet and where we're going.
[34:33.840 --> 34:45.940]  If we can't change the tide, us, freedom loving, God fearing citizens of this planet.
[34:45.940 --> 34:50.280]  So let me just give you the layout and then as Alex requested, I will read this whole
[34:50.280 --> 34:58.520]  article, Canadians, Canadian bill would ban suspected intent to commit hate speech online.
[34:58.520 --> 35:01.760]  So not even a crime.
[35:01.760 --> 35:10.840]  So this is minority report, this is the future crime unit, but that's not even a fair analysis.
[35:10.840 --> 35:16.200]  This is just the globalist and the radical left communists occupying America, occupying
[35:16.200 --> 35:28.040]  Canada, this is just their excuse to persecute and arrest or disappear anybody that they
[35:28.040 --> 35:30.840]  want to.
[35:30.840 --> 35:31.840]  That's what this is really about.
[35:31.840 --> 35:32.840]  It's not about hate speech.
[35:32.840 --> 35:33.840]  It's not about censorship.
[35:33.840 --> 35:42.160]  It's about they want to be able to disappear you.
[35:42.160 --> 35:47.360]  Now let me just tell you everything we got here.
[35:47.360 --> 35:54.040]  I've got all the latest updates out of Ukraine and Russia and then it appears now there's
[35:54.040 --> 35:57.240]  developments going on in Taiwan.
[35:57.240 --> 35:59.360]  What does that mean?
[35:59.360 --> 36:07.160]  I've got this big stack over here and quite frankly, the frustration is that everything
[36:07.160 --> 36:12.240]  that I can cover over here about COVID and the vaccine, we've already covered.
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.480]  We've been covering for two years, but now it's just mainstream accepted news with new
[36:17.480 --> 36:22.960]  studies that have just come out, Pfizer having to release their documents, everything we've
[36:22.960 --> 36:31.160]  been reporting is now 100% confirmed from the vaccines killing people or now what they
[36:31.160 --> 36:38.960]  call vaccine aides, vades to the masks never worked, the lockdown crashed the economy.
[36:38.960 --> 36:43.560]  It's just they're admitting all of it and they want you to forget about that as it
[36:43.560 --> 36:50.600]  all comes out and only think about Putin or only think about Ukraine, not thinking about
[36:50.600 --> 36:54.640]  all the crimes against humanity in the name of COVID that have been done to this planet,
[36:54.640 --> 37:00.600]  not to think about the crimes that have been done to you and this country by our bureaucrats,
[37:00.600 --> 37:04.860]  by our health officials, by our government, by our politicians, they want you to forget
[37:04.860 --> 37:16.960]  about all of that and just look into whatever it is they're telling you about Ukraine.
[37:16.960 --> 37:20.800]  But how are they going to cover up now?
[37:20.800 --> 37:24.480]  How are they going to cover up now these deadly vaccines?
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.440]  How are they going to cover up now all the lies and everything they told about COVID?
[37:29.440 --> 37:35.260]  Or maybe people will just move on and give up until the next deadly pandemic comes to
[37:35.260 --> 37:38.640]  crush us just a little bit more.
[37:38.640 --> 37:45.160]  But I'm telling you, folks, the latest studies that have just come out, it confirms all of
[37:45.160 --> 37:53.760]  our worst analysis, meaning the worst case scenario with these vaccines, it confirms
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.320]  all of it.
[37:57.320 --> 38:00.080]  And they can try to argue it away.
[38:00.080 --> 38:02.000]  They can try to flush it down the toilet.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.680]  They can try to act like it doesn't exist.
[38:04.680 --> 38:05.680]  No.
[38:05.680 --> 38:13.720]  Pfizer and Moderna and all of these vaccine manufacturers are in big, big trouble.
[38:13.720 --> 38:22.760]  And I guess the only hopes that the big pharmaceutical medical industrial complex has is that some
[38:22.760 --> 38:29.120]  sort of a World War scenario will distract from their crimes, distract from the deadly
[38:29.120 --> 38:36.280]  vaccines and make people forget so that they would never be held accountable.
[38:36.280 --> 38:40.360]  I want you to understand how real this is.
[38:40.360 --> 38:46.240]  I have friends that took this vaccine.
[38:46.240 --> 38:56.680]  I listened to talk radio show hosts that took this vaccine and they're panicked now.
[38:56.680 --> 38:59.720]  They weren't panicked when we first reported this stuff.
[38:59.720 --> 39:02.400]  They weren't panicked when we've been breaking this news for years.
[39:02.400 --> 39:05.240]  They weren't panicked when I warned them not to take it.
[39:05.240 --> 39:07.560]  The information is so overwhelming.
[39:07.560 --> 39:12.000]  The studies are so overwhelming now.
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.880]  I mean, here's one name I'm sure you heard of Dan Bongino covering it yesterday saying,
[39:15.880 --> 39:18.400]  hey, I took this vaccine.
[39:18.400 --> 39:20.200]  I'm reading these studies.
[39:20.200 --> 39:23.880]  Is this thing going to kill me now?
[39:23.880 --> 39:28.400]  That's not fun.
[39:28.400 --> 39:30.480]  Now why did that happen?
[39:30.480 --> 39:37.640]  Well, because the establishment and the media ran their fear mongering, the corrupt medical
[39:37.640 --> 39:44.600]  industrial complex run by Big Pharma told doctors vaccines are the only answers.
[39:44.600 --> 39:46.680]  And so, oh, you have a preexisting condition.
[39:46.680 --> 39:47.680]  Oh, you're unhealthy.
[39:47.680 --> 39:48.680]  Oh, you've had cancer.
[39:48.680 --> 39:49.680]  Oh, you've had this.
[39:49.680 --> 39:50.680]  Oh, you've had that.
[39:50.680 --> 39:52.680]  They say, you better take that vaccine.
[39:52.680 --> 39:57.520]  Even if it's against their own will and their own wishes, they get scared into taking that
[39:57.520 --> 39:59.520]  vaccine.
[39:59.520 --> 40:03.440]  And now here they are a year later looking at these studies saying the vaccine is going
[40:03.440 --> 40:11.080]  to potentially give them cancer or a heart problem and kill them and they're freaked out.
[40:11.080 --> 40:14.120]  My intent is not to freak anybody out.
[40:14.120 --> 40:18.320]  In fact, I mean, I almost feel bad.
[40:18.320 --> 40:27.920]  It's not the same level of sharing sad or bad information with someone like, you know,
[40:27.920 --> 40:31.160]  you've got to go to the family and say, hey, the heart surgery didn't take, he's gone or
[40:31.160 --> 40:37.600]  hey, you know, we tried to save him after the car accident, we couldn't or telling somebody
[40:37.600 --> 40:42.360]  they've got a terminal illness that they've just been diagnosed with.
[40:42.360 --> 40:46.160]  It's not quite that direct because it's not the interpersonal communication.
[40:46.160 --> 40:53.400]  But I mean, no, this is pretty serious stuff that I'm sorry you have to hear from Info
[40:53.400 --> 40:55.800]  Wars because nobody else will say it.
[40:55.800 --> 41:00.400]  Now, I can't really say no one else will say it because that's not true.
[41:00.400 --> 41:02.560]  Other people are now reporting it.
[41:02.560 --> 41:08.600]  And Dr. Peter McCullough, I mean, this guy is a hero.
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.240]  Dr. Peter McCullough is a hero.
[41:12.240 --> 41:20.320]  And he is doing hours and hours and hours and hours of interviews on any platform that
[41:20.320 --> 41:23.960]  will give him the time of day, no matter how big, no matter how small.
[41:23.960 --> 41:27.800]  And he's warning people, here's in the vaccines, here's the studies, here's the reports, here's
[41:27.800 --> 41:29.880]  the data, everything.
[41:29.880 --> 41:30.880]  He gets it.
[41:30.880 --> 41:33.880]  He's like, yeah, this is cataclysmic.
[41:33.880 --> 41:35.160]  You might want to know about this.
[41:35.160 --> 41:43.040]  He's in red alert mode, warning people about this as his duty as a doctor.
[41:43.040 --> 41:46.400]  Probably literally wakes up, does 30 interviews, and goes to bed.
[41:46.400 --> 41:51.040]  And just shows the data, shows the science, shows the studies, and it's so overwhelming
[41:51.040 --> 41:55.280]  now that everybody's starting to get it.
[41:55.280 --> 42:00.520]  And then you've got the State of the Union address tonight and all the details regarding
[42:00.520 --> 42:01.520]  that.
[42:01.520 --> 42:07.400]  I mean, it's just, honestly, it's just so overwhelming.
[42:07.400 --> 42:08.400]  And I've got more.
[42:08.400 --> 42:17.560]  Roger Stone has breaking news, so it's like, it's so over the top at this point.
[42:17.560 --> 42:24.760]  There is no real proper way to cover it than to just sit down, accept this as the State
[42:24.760 --> 42:30.920]  of the world, and just tell you the truth about what's going on.
[42:30.920 --> 42:37.960]  So I don't like to have to be up here as the tip of the spear for truth and resistance
[42:37.960 --> 42:44.320]  to the New World Order, diagnosing the planet with a terminal illness known as globalism
[42:44.320 --> 42:48.960]  or the World Economic Forum or the Great Reset.
[42:48.960 --> 42:53.120]  But there it is, there's your diagnosis.
[42:53.120 --> 42:54.800]  Civilization as we know it has a terminal illness.
[42:54.800 --> 42:55.880]  It's called the Great Reset.
[42:55.880 --> 43:00.640]  It's called globalism, and we need to stop it now.
[43:00.640 --> 43:06.080]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're
[43:06.080 --> 43:07.480]  going to be happy with.
[43:07.480 --> 43:10.280]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[43:10.280 --> 43:12.080]  It's a symbiotic relationship.

[43:23.320 --> 43:29.760]  in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360
[43:29.760 --> 43:31.520]  pin, ain't no brainer.
[43:31.520 --> 43:34.520]  And they've got high quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right now.

[43:43.480 --> 43:49.240]  The only way you lose is not taking action at infowarstore.com or prepare with Alex.com
[43:49.240 --> 43:50.240]  right now.

[44:32.200 --> 44:34.320]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[44:34.320 --> 44:35.320]  These aren't.
[44:35.320 --> 44:36.760]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.560]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[44:41.560 --> 44:44.960]  So the calls you are free or take a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced.
[44:44.960 --> 44:48.720]  And I keep one in my car, I've given them to my parents as gifts way out the middle
[44:48.720 --> 44:51.160]  of nowhere where regular phones don't work, they work.
[44:51.160 --> 45:00.040]  They're free phones.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[45:00.040 --> 45:06.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.880]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[45:08.880 --> 45:12.480]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of
[45:12.480 --> 45:16.080]  God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[45:16.080 --> 45:19.320]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[45:19.320 --> 45:23.160]  That's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[45:23.160 --> 45:26.960]  with the boy, is it true?
[45:26.960 --> 45:32.800]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[45:32.800 --> 45:36.600]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[45:36.600 --> 45:43.080]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to the
[45:43.080 --> 45:45.040]  God of this world who is a loser.
[45:45.040 --> 45:48.720]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than
[45:48.720 --> 45:49.720]  ever.
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.400]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[45:53.400 --> 45:58.200]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[45:58.200 --> 45:59.200]  just announced.
[45:59.200 --> 46:05.320]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth.
[46:05.320 --> 46:12.120]  And the next big casualty isn't even the people that die, no, that invariably follows.
[46:12.120 --> 46:21.000]  But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[46:21.000 --> 46:26.640]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[46:26.640 --> 46:35.320]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[46:35.320 --> 46:37.400]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[46:37.400 --> 46:43.480]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they
[46:43.480 --> 46:49.360]  think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored
[46:49.360 --> 46:50.360]  and arrested.
[46:50.360 --> 46:54.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[46:54.640 --> 47:01.120]  the world against humanity that makes them full wars dot com more important than ever.
[47:01.120 --> 47:17.920]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:17.920 --> 47:28.600]  So here's the deal, I need like a three hour college lecture type of platform and presentation
[47:28.600 --> 47:35.480]  today to really accurately and fully cover all this information.
[47:35.480 --> 47:39.240]  But I've got Roger Stone coming up with breaking news, I've got a great guest coming up in
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.480]  the third hour, Jake Ducey, and I've got to deal with these radio breaks.
[47:43.480 --> 47:50.320]  So what I might do is really just get into all of this on the war room today and just
[47:50.320 --> 47:56.240]  kind of parse through the more important stuff now on the Alex Jones show during these segments,
[47:56.240 --> 48:02.680]  but then really do like the college lecture three hour long, just full dissertation of
[48:02.680 --> 48:05.280]  all this information that we have in front of me.
[48:05.280 --> 48:10.640]  So I'm going to come back in the short segment and read this whole interview about thought
[48:10.640 --> 48:16.760]  crime, future crime units being rolled out in Canada like Minority Report that's happening.
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.960]  But let me do this right now, because this is just too important not to cover.
[48:20.960 --> 48:24.320]  And so is this Ukraine news, quite frankly.
[48:24.320 --> 48:27.040]  There's just so much of it, it's overwhelming.
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.760]  I mean, like I'm literally sitting here with the crew like, you know, what do we do?
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.160]  Because we're on TV stations, we're on radio stations, and it's like, we need a full three
[48:36.160 --> 48:37.920]  hours of broadcast.
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.320]  And we do light commercial breaks.
[48:41.320 --> 48:44.440]  And we wouldn't pay the bills without them and without our radios and TV syndicates
[48:44.440 --> 48:45.440]  and everything.
[48:45.440 --> 48:49.360]  But it's just, the problem is you don't hear this anywhere else.
[48:49.360 --> 48:52.320]  So there's a burden to make sure all of it gets out there for the public to hear.
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.760]  Now, let me just focus and actually cover this.
[48:56.760 --> 49:01.600]  So we're now getting the data on the vaccines and it's not good.
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.960]  Pfizer vaccine far less effective in five to 11 year olds, latest data shows.
[49:06.960 --> 49:11.960]  But no, it's not effective in anybody.
[49:11.960 --> 49:17.000]  The vaccine doesn't work for any age group.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.200]  It's a total failure.
[49:18.200 --> 49:24.560]  And in fact, I mean, folks, it's like injecting yourself with cancer.
[49:24.560 --> 49:26.280]  And that's not me saying it.
[49:26.280 --> 49:27.280]  That's doctors.
[49:27.280 --> 49:28.280]  That's the data.
[49:28.280 --> 49:37.960]  So here's the big study that I gave to the crew that I want them to put on the screen
[49:37.960 --> 49:44.560]  that has doctors panicking and talk show hosts panicking that took the vaccine.
[49:44.560 --> 49:47.080]  I mean, they're literally like, what is going on?
[49:47.080 --> 49:48.080]  What is inside of me?
[49:48.080 --> 49:54.560]  I was lied to, I'm ticked off as you should be from MD PI.
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.240]  Here's the study.
[49:59.240 --> 50:07.440]  Intracellular reverse transcription of Pfizer bio in tech, COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, BNT 162
[50:07.440 --> 50:12.600]  B2 in vitro and human liver cell line.
[50:12.600 --> 50:13.840]  That's the name of the study.
[50:13.840 --> 50:24.000]  Now, it's a very long report, very scientific in the presentation and the verbiage and everything.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.640]  And I'm going to try my best to put it into layman's terms.
[50:29.640 --> 50:34.000]  But pretty much everything that we've been warning about this vaccine for more than a
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.680]  year now is 100% confirmed.
[50:37.680 --> 50:39.440]  It's causing all kinds of heart problems.
[50:39.440 --> 50:41.440]  It's causing Guillain beret.
[50:41.440 --> 50:48.320]  Really it's just like, it's like Russian roulette with a chemical cocktail that could
[50:48.320 --> 50:54.680]  cause one of a hundred different problems to you and you never know when it might happen.
[50:54.680 --> 51:02.200]  Now they were giving out saline solutions in a lot of the shots, which had people asking
[51:02.200 --> 51:03.200]  why?
[51:03.200 --> 51:07.920]  Well, maybe that's because they didn't want everyone to just straight up die in the next
[51:07.920 --> 51:15.840]  20 years that took this vaccine because it would be too obvious.
[51:15.840 --> 51:27.640]  Now imagine if we knew this at InfoWars, if the doctors we had on as guests knew this,
[51:27.640 --> 51:34.120]  am I supposed to believe that the CDC and the FDA and the vaccine manufacturers didn't
[51:34.120 --> 51:42.440]  know this, and then the one piece of evidence that I would have to be presented to confirm
[51:42.440 --> 51:52.360]  or deny that would be the leaked PowerPoint slides from, I believe it was Pfizer or maybe
[51:52.360 --> 51:53.360]  it was the FDA.
[51:53.360 --> 51:54.920]  I can't recall who it is exactly right now.
[51:54.920 --> 51:59.120]  But the leaked PowerPoint slides that said, here's all the side effects of the vaccine.
[51:59.120 --> 52:00.440]  Yeah, it was the FDA.
[52:00.440 --> 52:01.800]  Thank you.
[52:01.800 --> 52:03.280]  Here's all the side effects of the vaccine.
[52:03.280 --> 52:07.240]  This was October 2020 before they rolled it out.
[52:07.240 --> 52:12.800]  And here's all the side effects, very common, including death.
[52:12.800 --> 52:13.800]  Did they tell you about that?
[52:13.800 --> 52:15.080]  No, they covered it up.
[52:15.080 --> 52:16.520]  Did they roll out the vaccine anyway?
[52:16.520 --> 52:18.400]  They sure did.
[52:18.400 --> 52:25.200]  And now the VAERS reporting website, the Vaccine Adverse Reaction website, has confirmed
[52:25.200 --> 52:28.520]  at least 20,000 dead from the vaccine.
[52:28.520 --> 52:33.840]  They estimate they get maybe 10% of the Vaccine Adverse Reaction reports there on that website.
[52:33.840 --> 52:35.560]  So you multiply that by 10.
[52:35.560 --> 52:39.400]  You're talking about 200,000 dead from the vaccine, which are the numbers that Dr. Peter
[52:39.400 --> 52:40.900]  McCullough is estimating.
[52:40.900 --> 52:46.240]  He said on his latest interview, it's about 187,000 people he thinks died from the vaccine.
[52:46.240 --> 52:55.360]  Now, here's the real world relevant data that confirms in live time what these vaccines
[52:55.360 --> 52:59.480]  are doing.
[52:59.480 --> 53:09.120]  Attorney Thomas Renz, under penalty of perjury, presented Department of Defense statistics
[53:09.120 --> 53:15.840]  showing radical increases in all types of diseases, heart problems, cancers, miscarriages.
[53:15.840 --> 53:16.920]  The list just goes on and on.
[53:16.920 --> 53:20.960]  Like every single one numbers skyrocketing.
[53:20.960 --> 53:23.960]  What's the anomaly?
[53:23.960 --> 53:26.200]  What's the controlled variable?
[53:26.200 --> 53:30.560]  Well, it's the vaccine.
[53:30.560 --> 53:37.000]  So there's your confirmation of the study that proves these vaccines.
[53:37.000 --> 53:44.680]  But here's the problem is I'm not a doctor, so I don't have the most eloquent way of explaining
[53:44.680 --> 53:45.880]  this to you.
[53:45.880 --> 53:53.080]  But basically what it is is that when this vaccine gets in you, it's a permanent spike
[53:53.080 --> 54:00.920]  protein synthetic DNA that never leaves your body potentially.
[54:00.920 --> 54:03.040]  I mean maybe there's a way to get rid of it.
[54:03.040 --> 54:04.040]  Some theorize there is.
[54:04.040 --> 54:08.560]  If you get two or three though, you're probably never coming out of this.
[54:08.560 --> 54:19.880]  A synthetic DNA and spike protein that basically rewrites your DNA and then it's like you get
[54:19.880 --> 54:25.360]  a fresh DNA sequence, you're no longer yourself like, oh, I'm no longer Owen Schreuer.
[54:25.360 --> 54:28.720]  I'm now Pfizer mRNA patented technology.
[54:28.720 --> 54:30.320]  I'm not even an organic human.
[54:30.320 --> 54:38.680]  I'm a genetically modified human that is now producing spike proteins in a fresh new synthetic
[54:38.680 --> 54:45.240]  DNA sequence that can essentially open me up to any and every disease.
[54:45.240 --> 54:49.080]  So if I had any immunity to other diseases, it's now gone.
[54:49.080 --> 54:55.720]  If I was resilient against some sort of infections or diseases, that's now gone.
[54:55.720 --> 55:04.800]  You've basically been reset as a non-organic human to be susceptible to any type of outbreak,
[55:04.800 --> 55:10.200]  any type of virus, any type of disease, any type of heart problem, anything.
[55:10.200 --> 55:13.960]  So like you know how they do this thing where they can say, oh, you're prone to heart problems
[55:13.960 --> 55:17.160]  or you're prone to a brain aneurysm or you have all this stuff and we can have a surgery
[55:17.160 --> 55:19.720]  and we can, we can take care of that for you.
[55:19.720 --> 55:26.160]  Well, now that's everyone that's taken this vaccine, except we don't know what you might
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.720]  be prone to because it's just chemical Russian roulette in your body.
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.440]  And there is no long-term study of this.
[55:34.440 --> 55:41.280]  But in the short term, we already know what it's doing to people, CDC under fire for not
[55:41.280 --> 55:44.480]  publishing all COVID-19 data it collects.
[55:44.480 --> 55:50.040]  Yeah, well, they can't show you that the vaccines are killing people, that they promoted and
[55:50.040 --> 55:54.360]  said we're safe and effective.
[55:54.360 --> 55:59.280]  So let me read some of the latest here from Dr. Peter McCullough.
[55:59.280 --> 56:02.480]  Practitioners are most interested in analysis of the safety data.
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.400]  With over one million safety reports through February 11th, 2022, understanding organ
[56:07.400 --> 56:12.560]  injury, risk prediction, hospitalization, death as outcomes is critical to the informed
[56:12.560 --> 56:15.120]  consent process for those still contemplating.
[56:15.120 --> 56:20.480]  In other words, they never told you all the side effects about the vaccines.
[56:20.480 --> 56:22.000]  They broke the law.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.200]  That's a crime against humanity.
[56:26.200 --> 56:32.760]  Dr. Cattigini, I'm probably butchering that, Dr. Cattigiani from Brazil has hit on a key
[56:32.760 --> 56:39.200]  understanding that cataclysm mines in the setting of spike protein mayocarditis trigger
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.400]  the fatal sequence to cardiac death.
[56:42.400 --> 56:47.200]  Large number of athlete deaths are now in medical literature will generate considerable
[56:47.200 --> 56:49.560]  attention research.
[56:49.560 --> 56:55.520]  In other words, the vaccines are causing deadly heart attacks.
[56:55.520 --> 57:02.320]  Side by side, important reports, reverse transcription, nuclear DNA code for spike protein, both significant
[57:02.320 --> 57:10.440]  discoveries, enormous implications of permanent chromosomal change and long-term constitutive
[57:10.440 --> 57:15.200]  spike synthesis drive the pathogens of a whole new genre of chronic diseases.
[57:15.200 --> 57:16.840]  Did you hear that?
[57:16.840 --> 57:22.360]  Again, I'm not the doctor and I had to do all kinds of reading just to try to put this
[57:22.360 --> 57:24.240]  in layman's terms for you.
[57:24.240 --> 57:29.080]  But basically, you're now a new species.
[57:29.080 --> 57:31.480]  You're not even technically a human.
[57:31.480 --> 57:36.440]  You're now like a new species, new DNA, and we don't know what kind of diseases you might
[57:36.440 --> 57:37.440]  get.
[57:37.440 --> 57:40.880]  You might pass on side effects.
[57:40.880 --> 57:42.440]  I mean, this is crazy.
[57:42.440 --> 57:46.440]  Now I got to go to a break, so I can't cover all of it.
[57:46.440 --> 57:56.000]  Two, life-changing, life-empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.440]  for months at infowarstore.com.
[57:59.440 --> 58:03.640]  Winter sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3, taken out of the tongue.
[58:03.640 --> 58:08.600]  It also has vitamin K, critical fear immune system and so much more.
[58:08.600 --> 58:12.600]  It's 50% off, despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly, because everybody
[58:12.600 --> 58:13.600]  needs this.
[58:13.600 --> 58:15.840]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[58:15.840 --> 58:17.440]  You need what's in winter sun.
[58:17.440 --> 58:26.280]  And then we have brain force, ultra, super-fast-acting, amazing, clean, neutropic system that is a
[58:26.280 --> 58:30.160]  complement to brain force plus and, of course, turbo force.
[58:30.160 --> 58:34.240]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and
[58:34.240 --> 58:37.560]  take your focus and clarity and alert us to the next level.
[58:37.560 --> 58:42.560]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[58:42.560 --> 58:43.560]  Thank you all for your support.
[58:43.560 --> 58:50.560]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to, because they are amazing, infowarstore.com.
[58:50.560 --> 58:55.920]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[58:55.920 --> 58:57.960]  a healthier life.
[58:57.960 --> 59:01.800]  This has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[59:01.800 --> 59:03.440]  that contains both.
[59:03.440 --> 59:08.400]  This infowar's life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[59:08.400 --> 59:10.000]  from the infowarstore.
[59:10.000 --> 59:14.800]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[59:14.800 --> 59:17.520]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[59:17.520 --> 59:22.440]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[59:22.440 --> 59:27.080]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[59:27.080 --> 59:28.080]  shown.
[59:28.080 --> 59:32.360]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[59:32.360 --> 59:36.920]  role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[59:36.920 --> 59:42.040]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[59:42.040 --> 59:43.040]  like here in America.
[59:43.040 --> 59:48.080]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our
[59:48.080 --> 59:51.600]  rose hips don't lie.
[59:51.600 --> 1:00:19.040]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:25.560]  The story is at infowarstore.com, the headline is Canadian bill would ban suspected intent
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:28.040]  to commit hate speech online.
[1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:35.540]  The future crime unit, not for actual crimes, but for speech they don't want you to have.
[1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:41.240]  Bill would allow courts to punish Canadians for things they haven't done yet.
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:46.360]  A proposed bill would penalize Canadians if they are simply suspected of intending to post
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:47.360]  hate speech online.
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:52.960]  Boy, I don't see how that's a dangerous precedent at all for radical authoritarian communists
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:56.680]  to disappear their political opposition as they're already doing.
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:00.360]  This would just multiply it by thousands.
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:04.760]  In other words, the bill would allow courts to punish Canadians for things they haven't
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:07.560]  done yet or might never do.
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:12.760]  The bill was noticed by a tech insider who also pointed out the bill's fuzzy and circular
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:16.200]  definition of hate speech.
[1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:22.240]  The Canadian government has proposed legislation, Bill C-36, where people can be taken to court
[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:28.640]  and penalized if they're suspected of being about to post something hateful online, which
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:33.760]  again, who decides what's hateful and who's not the corrupt authoritarian communist that
[1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:34.760]  wants you dead.
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:37.280]  I wonder how that's going to go for you.
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:41.600]  An individual would be able to report another preemptively for something they haven't done
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:42.600]  yet.
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.320]  Oh, I just got into a dispute with my neighbor.
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:50.880]  I think I'm going to call the cops and say he's about to call me the N-Wared online.
[1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:54.320]  And then the Canadian police roll up, take you to a courtroom, you don't even have a
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:01:55.320]  fair trial.
[1:01:55.320 --> 1:02:01.000]  Oh, you're a racist, you're going to post something racist, bye, jail time for you.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.080]  And you're just done, you just don't even know what you can do, it's just there's your
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:09.880]  fate all decided right there for something you've never even done or would do.
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:18.880]  Fuzzy aspects in ascending order, fuzzy and curricular definition of hateful speech involves
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:27.080]  detestation stronger than dislike, encouraging citizens to report on one another, the ability
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:32.120]  to punish people for something they haven't even done or may never do.
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:37.200]  In fact, Canadian media outlets first reported the bill last June, but the bill is not under
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:42.040]  further scrutiny after the Canadian government's heavy-handed response to the Ottawa trucker
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:43.040]  protest.
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:47.240]  The Global News of Canada reported that Bill C-36 would allow a person to appear before
[1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:55.440]  a provincial court if the person fears, as in suspects, that another criminal, another
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:59.800]  will commit a hate offense, which includes speech online.
[1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:02.280]  Critics of the bill said it would infringe on free speech.
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:06.480]  This bill would not target hate speech, just ensure bureaucrats in Ottawa are bogged down
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:09.320]  with frivolous complaints about tweets.
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:13.760]  Conservative Shadow Minister for Justice Rob Moore said the Trudeau liberals are empowering
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:19.280]  a bureaucracy to subjectively restrict the rights of Canadians.
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:21.840]  Here's what it is.
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:29.880]  The radical left-wing communists that are brainwashed by the New World Order propaganda
[1:03:29.880 --> 1:03:34.320]  just want every excuse, every reason to disappear you.
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:37.600]  That's what this is all about.
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:44.200]  Not just your corrupt bureaucrats, but your street-level leftists as well.
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:47.720]  They get joy out of watching you suffer.
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:51.800]  They get joy out of seeing you destroyed.
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.320]  They want you dead.
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:59.680]  But since murder is still illegal, they figure the next best thing is to throw you in prison
[1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:06.080]  for life and torture you in a jail cell for life and steal your future and steal your
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:09.640]  prosperity and steal your destiny.
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:11.360]  That's what gets them off.
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:13.360]  You get excited if you have a big accomplishment.
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:14.360]  Maybe you have a kid.
[1:04:14.360 --> 1:04:15.640]  Maybe you get a new job.
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:17.160]  Maybe you reach a financial goal.
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:21.120]  Maybe you reach an academic goal.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.320]  Maybe you accomplish a magnificent athletic feature.
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.960]  Those are the kind of things that you get excited about.
[1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:31.040]  Those are the kind of things that people get excited about.
[1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:32.360]  Not these creeps.
[1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:34.280]  No, not these creeps.
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:35.280]  They get excited.
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:41.800]  They get off by destroying your life and watching you suffer.
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:46.920]  So really, it's just the lazy man's way out of ever trying to accomplish anything.
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:53.520]  And this just empowers them to give them their ultimate gratitude, which is to destroy you
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:59.560]  like what they've tried to do to Roger Stone who joins me next.
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:02.480]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:08.200]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting
[1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:12.600]  people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[1:05:12.600 --> 1:05:16.920]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:18.760]  or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:23.240]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:24.840]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:26.560]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:29.040]  You die in five or six days without water.
[1:05:29.040 --> 1:05:30.640]  You die in a month without food.
[1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:35.680]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:36.760]  you need.
[1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:40.800]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:45.920]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's
[1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:52.320]  defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:55.360]  The old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3.
[1:05:55.360 --> 1:06:18.800]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:27.280]  Roger Stone, who if the psychotic corrupt liberal Democrats had their way wouldn't be
[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:32.600]  with us right now, he'd be rotting away in a jail cell or God forbid in a better place
[1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:35.400]  maybe and not even with us on this planet anymore.
[1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:38.800]  But thank God for Donald Trump for setting an innocent man free.
[1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:44.200]  And thank God Roger Stone can be with us here today, despite the continued political persecution
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:45.320]  that he goes through.
[1:06:45.320 --> 1:06:48.600]  But that's not what he's here to talk about today.
[1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:55.360]  He's here to talk about another story of political persecution involving a New York
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:07:01.680]  police officer who is one of the latest victims of the criminal Democrat Party and their political
[1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:07.360]  persecution of anybody who is in Washington, D.C. on January 6.
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:08.800]  Roger Stone joins me now.
[1:07:08.800 --> 1:07:11.920]  Roger, you've just published a story on the Gateway Pundit.
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:15.880]  Let's go ahead and break this news.
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:16.880]  Thank you very much.
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:18.880]  Owen, it's great to be back with you.
[1:07:18.880 --> 1:07:24.960]  My old seatmate from the war room, which is a must see show every day at four o'clock
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:28.080]  Central, five o'clock Eastern.
[1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:33.520]  Right here now, once again, here at Info Wars, we're breaking tomorrow's news today
[1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:40.360]  because the trial for Salvatore Greco, a New York City police officer who has done nothing
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:46.880]  wrong, adjourned only moments ago when the judge got too sick to proceed and has been
[1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:50.120]  postponed perhaps until tomorrow.
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:55.640]  Sal Greco is a 14-year veteran of the New York Police Department with an unblemished
[1:07:55.640 --> 1:08:01.600]  record of public service in some of the most undesirable and dangerous precincts in New
[1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:06.160]  York City, in the Bronx, in Brooklyn, and in Manhattan.
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:12.280]  In 2018, Sal Greco and I became friends because I noticed on Instagram that he was a big fan
[1:08:12.280 --> 1:08:18.600]  of Info Wars and, secondarily, that he was posting in defense of me as I battled against
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:20.080]  the deep state.
[1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:27.800]  Now, Sal Greco is being subjected to the same kind of political hit job as you are, Owen.
[1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:31.720]  He is being charged on the basis of nothing.
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:38.360]  You see, Sal Greco was in Washington, D.C., on the January 5th and January 6th.
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:41.720]  Like me, he was not at the ellipse when the president spoke.
[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.960]  He did not march to the Capitol.
[1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:47.040]  He was not at the Capitol.
[1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:54.160]  They are claiming that this officer, Sal Greco, should be fired and terminated from his job
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:09:01.560]  at the NYPD, in which case he would lose the pension that he's paid into for 14 years,
[1:09:01.560 --> 1:09:06.520]  especially because they say he consorted with a known convicted felon.
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:13.040]  Well, that would be me, except for my felon when he convicted, was voided with an unconditional
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:14.800]  presidential pardon.
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:20.680]  They also say, they imply that I paid him for security services, no.
[1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:26.560]  He was there in his capacity as a private citizen, taking a vacation day because he's
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:30.760]  a porter of the president and he is a friend of mine.
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:34.680]  Now, for two years, they have tortured Sal Greco.
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:41.960]  Why in their two-year investigation have they never contacted me or my lawyer to ask me
[1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:46.600]  to explain what my relationship with Sal Greco is?
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:51.120]  So I am going to stay on this case and say this.
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:57.720]  If they terminate Sal Greco, I believe they're buying themselves a $25 million lawsuit because
[1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:01.160]  the basis for his termination is bogus.
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:06.680]  And if communications with a convicted felon is a problem, the New York City Mayor Eric
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:12.440]  Adams has a huge problem because he has written that when he was a New York City police captain,
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:18.840]  he provided personal security for Mike Tyson at a time Mike Tyson was a convicted felon.
[1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:22.080]  There can only be one standard, equality.
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:24.360]  This is an equal protection lawsuit.
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:29.960]  The New York PD will pay through the nose if they terminate this brave son of Staten
[1:10:29.960 --> 1:10:31.200]  Island.
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:38.600]  But as you know, all too well, Owen, a lawsuit costs a huge amount of money.
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.400]  Sal Greco doesn't have the kind of money it takes to fight New York Police Department
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:44.960]  or the City of New York.
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:50.880]  And therefore, people who want to help him can go to helpthisnycop.com.
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:53.960]  That's helpthisnycop.com.
[1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:55.520]  I've just laid it out for you.
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.480]  Now let's talk about it.
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:00.080]  So let me get this straight.
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:06.880]  He's not actually charged with anything and the NYPD is trying to have him fired in a
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:12.880]  departmental trial just because he was in a hotel room with you?
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:14.960]  Essentially, that's correct.
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.280]  They need to be really careful in this sense.
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:23.560]  As you know, immediately after the president spoke, there was a call on the house phone
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.760]  in my hotel suite.
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:29.040]  And it was Officer Sal Greco who answered it.
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:35.240]  It was the Secret Service offering to escort me up to the Capitol, an offer I found extremely
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:37.720]  fishy and which I declined.
[1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:41.880]  Two very prominent pastors witnessed this phone call.
[1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:44.360]  It's also recorded on video.
[1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:49.760]  I don't think the January 6th committee wants to look into the role of the Secret Service.
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:54.800]  I don't think they want to look into what transpired that day in terms of me and the
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:56.200]  Secret Service.
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:03.640]  All I know is any claim that I knew about or was involved in any way in the illegal
[1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:07.680]  actions of January 6th is categorically false.
[1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:09.120]  There is no witness.
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:10.640]  There is no document.
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:16.280]  There is nothing to prove otherwise because it is a fact, just as I say it is.
[1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:21.160]  Sal Greco is essentially being penalized because he is a supporter of Donald Trump, because
[1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:27.720]  he is an info warrior, and because he became a friend of mine in the two-year ordeal that
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:31.080]  I was subjected to.
[1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:34.680]  The New York Police Department has leaked relentlessly about this case to the New York
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:39.840]  Daily News, but those leaks have been blamed on Sal Greco.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:43.600]  This is an outrageous act of injustice.
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:50.040]  Every resident of Staten Island, every Italian American, everyone who supports law enforcement,
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:55.560]  every info warrior should be outraged about this and should stand up with us for Sal Greco.
[1:12:55.560 --> 1:13:03.200]  Well, look, we know that the modern-day progressive liberal Democrats love seeing a cop's head
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:07.960]  in a noose politically, love seeing violence being done against cops and celebrating when
[1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:09.560]  cops get attacked and killed.
[1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:12.200]  They just love it so much.
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:14.560]  But what about the NYPD's response to this?
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:20.960]  I mean, fellow officers coming to his aides, I mean, his higher-ups coming to his aid,
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:22.840]  or are they out to get him too?
[1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:28.480]  Well, first of all, my hats off to the PBA, the Patrolman's Benevolent Association.
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:31.040]  They have supported him with a very able lawyer.
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:33.320]  The lawyer has done as much as he can.
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:36.880]  By the way, those are great people at the Police Benevolence Association.
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:37.880]  Fantastic people.
[1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:43.360]  But the hierarchy at the New York Police Department is completely politicized, first by Mayor
[1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:49.520]  de Blasio, the worst mayor in New York history, and now by Mayor Adams, they're woke.
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:55.320]  So they've conducted an investigation to try to determine whether, because Sal Greco came
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:14:00.560]  in contact, casual contact in this case, with members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:05.760]  Boys, they somehow imply that that's a crime, that, of course, is not a crime.
[1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:07.760]  That's guilt by association.
[1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:11.520]  ABC News has tried this for over a year.
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:17.640]  In this recent filing in federal court in the lawsuit against President Trump, they actually
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:18.640]  reason.
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:21.720]  Roger Stone spoke to President Trump post-election.
[1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:27.200]  Roger Stone came in contact with some of the Oath Keepers who later broke into the Capitol.
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:32.160]  Ergo, a deep-dive investigation into Roger Stone might prove something else.
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:35.120]  No, it will prove nothing whatsoever.
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:40.860]  That's why, last week, I filed a lawsuit against Adam Schiff in the January 6th committee
[1:14:40.860 --> 1:14:43.920]  because they want to conduct yet another witch hunt.
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:48.080]  On the basis of no probable cause, on the basis of no evidence, they want to root through
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:50.880]  all of my cell phone records.
[1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:51.880]  Not happening.
[1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:57.160]  And up next, and I'll be totally clear with you, I'm going to sue Hillary Clinton and
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:03.600]  John Podesta and Michael Sussman and Huma Abedin and their entire cabal in a class action
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:04.600]  suit.
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:08.420]  I'm going to have standing to do so because right up until this day, the death threats
[1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:13.440]  continue against me, the threats against my family continue against me, I lose economic
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:18.400]  opportunities and job opportunities because people tell me that I'm too controversial
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:22.680]  based on the claim that I was a Russian intelligence asset.
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:25.080]  So now the worm has turned.
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:30.400]  Now it is Hillary Clinton and her criminal gang that will be under attack in the courts.
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:32.880]  I really look forward to this.
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:39.560]  Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger, Roger.
[1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:42.760]  And of course, they really just want to make it criminal for us to exist.
[1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:43.760]  That's what this is really about.
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:45.520]  We're us existing.
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:47.280]  They want that to be a criminal offense.
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:52.080]  So we'll get into more of this with Roger Stone and other January 6 news folks.
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:53.400]  These people are out of control.
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:16:00.520]  We're dealing with a mafia gangster with government power.
[1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:05.960]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:07.360]  going to be happy with.
[1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:10.160]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:11.960]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[1:16:11.960 --> 1:16:13.040]  I promote liberty.
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:14.120]  I promote freedom.
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:18.960]  I fight the globalist and I'm able to do that because you buy products at infowarestore.com.
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:23.200]  And listen, all the products are great, but when it comes to high quality, storeable food
[1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:29.640]  in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360
[1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:31.400]  pin, ain't no brainer.
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:34.400]  And they've got high quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right now.
[1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:39.640]  The great folks at my patron's supply exclusively prepare with alex.com discounted.
[1:16:39.640 --> 1:16:43.040]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the info war.
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:49.120]  The only way you lose is not taking action at infowarestore.com or prepare with alex.com
[1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:50.120]  right now.
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:51.280]  This is high quality, storeable food.
[1:16:51.280 --> 1:16:53.400]  This is how you beat inflation.
[1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:54.400]  Get yours today.
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:55.400]  It's ready to ship.
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:59.520]  But I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:01.240]  And hold out for months.
[1:17:01.240 --> 1:17:03.880]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:07.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:11.280]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:13.280]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:15.240]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:20.600]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:25.200]  does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune
[1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:26.200]  system.
[1:17:26.200 --> 1:17:32.920]  X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, it's now exclusively available again
[1:17:32.920 --> 1:17:35.840]  at 50% off at infowarestore.com.
[1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:39.680]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about
[1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:44.040]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:17:44.040 --> 1:17:46.840]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:50.920]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:51.920]  what it does for your body.
[1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:56.640]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[1:17:56.640 --> 1:18:00.160]  So again, X3, back at stock, 50% off at limited time.
[1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:06.760]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth, and the
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:10.760]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:18.680]  No, that invariably follows, but first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty
[1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:24.000]  and speech and massive censorship, and now across the world, from the United States to
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:34.120]  Europe, legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information,
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:39.760]  you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned, and of course now Canada
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:45.360]  has introduced legislation that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have
[1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:51.600]  the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:55.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:19:00.160]  the world against humanity that makes M4s.com more important than ever.
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:05.760]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here, all over the world, from Australia to
[1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:08.200]  the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:12.120]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[1:19:12.120 --> 1:19:18.600]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:23.160]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[1:19:23.160 --> 1:19:27.160]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:30.800]  This is nothing less than martial law, and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:35.160]  to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America, and are very
[1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:40.080]  compliant, meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:45.360]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:50.480]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've
[1:19:50.480 --> 1:19:55.600]  got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads, it's all there at infowarstore.com.
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:00.840]  So protect your privacy today and support the infowar at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:16.040]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:26.840]  So a good cop, New York police departments, Sal Greco, is facing termination not because
[1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:32.200]  he committed a crime, not because he did anything wrong, but simply because he exists as a Trump
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:38.480]  supporter, they are trying to have him removed from the department and his pension stripped
[1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:39.480]  from him.
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:45.560]  Meanwhile though, high school assistant principal in Michigan is able to return to work while
[1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:50.040]  awaiting trial for first degree child sex assault.
[1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:51.360]  Must be some of that white privilege.
[1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:53.240]  Oh no, he's not white, sorry.
[1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:59.800]  So he's able to go to work while being charged with first degree child sex assault, he's
[1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:04.120]  going to go back to school where the children are.
[1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:08.760]  But an innocent man, Sal Greco, might not be able to go back to work well because he supports
[1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:12.160]  Donald Trump, which of course is the greatest crime of all.
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:17.760]  Now Roger, there is other news breaking when it comes to January 6th.
[1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:21.400]  The Democrats have another Trump supporter killed.
[1:21:21.400 --> 1:21:25.440]  This time, sadly, he took his own life and that is Matthew Perna.
[1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:31.520]  So it's kind of a debate right now, but the way I see it, the January 6th casualty list
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:36.840]  has the Democrats have killed at least five Trump supporters, none of them have had any
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:41.200]  casualties, but we have Ashley Babbitt, we have Roseanne Boylan, we have the individual
[1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:44.960]  who got shoved off the side of the Capitol steps by police that died.
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:48.680]  Now we have Matthew Perna, we have the individual who had a flash bang blow up in his face,
[1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:51.280]  he died from injuries later.
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:55.280]  But nobody died at the hands of Trump supporters that day, but at least five people have now
[1:21:55.280 --> 1:22:01.280]  died because of the Democrat activity that day, including one person taking his own life
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:03.400]  over complete phony charges.
[1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:08.080]  He spent 10 minutes in the Capitol max, didn't do any violence, they recognized all that
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:10.600]  in the court case, but they wouldn't leave him alone.
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:14.160]  They wanted to put him in jail for 10 years.
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:15.160]  This is what they want.
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:19.320]  They want to torture, if they can't just kill us, they want to either imprison us for life
[1:22:19.320 --> 1:22:22.320]  or torture us into suicide, Roger.
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:25.000]  I'm in total agreement with your analysis.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.960]  This case of Mr. Perna is particularly tragic.
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:31.880]  He didn't steal anything, he didn't break anything, he didn't hurt anybody, he didn't
[1:22:31.880 --> 1:22:33.160]  assault anyone.
[1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:38.640]  He strolled through the Capitol for 20 minutes taking pictures, yet they wanted to destroy
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:42.080]  his life and then sadly he's taken his own life.
[1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:47.680]  Or the case of Roseanne Boylan, who is literally bludgeoned to death after being sprayed in
[1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:53.280]  the face with mace by a Capitol Hill police officer, that's called first degree murder.
[1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:57.880]  When you attack an unarmed person and you kill them, even if you're a police officer,
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:00.000]  trespassing does not give you that privilege.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.640]  The officer who did that needs to be prosecuted.
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:08.920]  The real tragedy here is for all of the Jane or 16 detainees, most of them do not have
[1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:12.320]  adequate legal representation.
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:16.440]  Their due process rights are being violated.
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:21.320]  If you don't take the public defender, who is just some local liberal who urges you to
[1:23:21.320 --> 1:23:27.640]  sign a confession blaming Donald Trump for everything and you choose to represent yourself,
[1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:32.280]  you are not given access to a law library, you're not given access to a computer, you're
[1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:36.720]  given a laptop with a rundown battery for one hour a day.
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:42.920]  During that one hour you can choose to shower, shave, defecate, or you can work on your defense
[1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:46.520]  of course until the battery wears out, then you can do nothing.
[1:23:46.520 --> 1:23:48.600]  Where's the American Civil Liberties Union?
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:49.800]  How come we haven't heard from them?
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:51.560]  Why are they silent?
[1:23:51.560 --> 1:23:57.160]  In all honesty, I call on President Trump to set up a fund to raise the money for adequate
[1:23:57.160 --> 1:24:01.400]  legal representation for all of those who have been detained.
[1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:06.600]  This is nothing worse than murder, it is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.
[1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:12.840]  We are treating American citizens worse than we are treating terrorists.
[1:24:12.840 --> 1:24:16.200]  That is disgraceful and something has to be done about it.
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:20.880]  Now I'll be honest with you, my own lawyers have urged me not to speak about this.
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:25.800]  Not because I know anything about January 6th, not because I have any previous knowledge,
[1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:30.400]  not because I was involved in any way, but just because it generates more lawsuits.
[1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:37.640]  I'm already facing a baseless harassment lawsuit by six police officers propped up by the Lawyers
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:41.440]  for Civil Rights Committee, a George Soros front.
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:46.640]  I just want to let the lawyers who file this know, yes I'm going to be filing Rule 12 charges
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:51.440]  against you, yes I'm going to be complaining to the Bar Association wherever you are admitted
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:52.440]  to the bar.
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:55.080]  You want a fight, you will get a fight.
[1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:56.840]  But people need to support me to do that.
[1:24:56.840 --> 1:25:04.600]  They can go to StoneDefenseFund.com, StoneDefenseFund.com, because like you there at Infowars, I am
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:06.520]  under siege.
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:10.160]  They took my home, my car, my insurance, my ability to make a living.
[1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:15.640]  I'm still struggling economically, but I will say this Owen, I will never stop fighting
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:16.760]  these demons.
[1:25:16.760 --> 1:25:22.240]  I will never stop fighting the satanic forces now in control of the country.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:23.240]  You're absolutely right.
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:27.000]  They get their rocks off by attacking us.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.280]  So help Sal Greco by going to helpthisnycop.com.
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:35.040]  You can help me by going to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:37.160]  You see both of those addresses there.
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:38.320]  I need your help.
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:42.080]  And while you're at it, go to the Infowars store right now.
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:45.560]  You can, by the way, you can just make a straight donation if you're not in the market for one
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:49.200]  of their great products, or you can buy one of their great products.
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:53.640]  I'm a giant fan, as you know Owen, of Brainforce.
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:59.160]  Brainforce may be my favorite product in the Infowars store, because I'm working, you know,
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:01.800]  some 17 hour days.
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:06.280]  And when you reach, when you hit that wall, when you can't write anymore, you can't record
[1:26:06.280 --> 1:26:07.280]  anymore.
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:08.640]  You can't work anymore.
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:11.240]  You can't talk on the phone anymore.
[1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:16.840]  You pop some of Brainforce and you'll get a nice subtle lift in your energy.
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:19.200]  You get nice mental focus.
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:23.360]  But then when you're ready to go to sleep, you're not wide open as if you'd taken one
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:26.240]  of these ephedra-based drugs.
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:31.880]  So I can't say enough about Brainforce as a product, and I urge you to support Infowars
[1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:34.360]  because it is the tip of the spear.
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:39.320]  Now I can already predict to you, media matters for America is going to go crazy saying, stone
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:41.960]  is out pushing Jones's products.
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:43.720]  No, there's nothing in this for me.
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:45.400]  I'm paid zero.
[1:26:45.400 --> 1:26:48.040]  I like Brainforce because it's a great product.
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:52.200]  And not only do you get a great product, but you're helping Infowars.
[1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:56.920]  You're helping the beacon of truth that Infowars is.
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:01.360]  You're propping up the war room, the second best show on the internet.
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:07.120]  Of course, it was better when I was there, but maybe that'll happen again, who knows.
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:11.640]  And we should sue the guy who stole our name, by the way, it occurs to me in any event.
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:12.640]  That's my riff.
[1:27:12.640 --> 1:27:17.160]  There's also, I think it was like Carville and this other guy also took up the name
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:18.560]  War Room too.
[1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:21.480]  Everybody wanted to name their show the War Room after hours.
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:23.160]  It's kind of a weird thing how that worked out.
[1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:24.560]  It was all after us, by the way.
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:29.280]  Roger and I were the first ones in the modern media political spectrum to have the War Room.
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:32.880]  Of course, it did start in the nineties with the Clinton War Room, but that's long gone
[1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:33.880]  by now.
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:39.520]  But imagine, folks, I mean, you're Roger Stone, you go down to breakfast, you have breakfast,
[1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:42.520]  you go back up to your hotel room and you're like, yeah, you know what, I think I'm just
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:44.440]  going to take it easy today.
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:47.520]  Who knows, maybe you take a nap, maybe you play a game of cards, whatever.
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:50.960]  And then the next thing you know is, oh, we're charging you with crimes, we're charging you
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:55.840]  for stuff on January 6th and you're like, I literally was sitting in a hotel room.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:28:01.120]  I mean, if that doesn't tell the story about how out of control this political persecution
[1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:03.200]  is, maybe the next segment will get into it.
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:07.600]  But I mean, just talk about that experience briefly, Roger, in the last 30 seconds here.
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:11.080]  Just like you literally do nothing, have nothing to do with January 6th and all of a sudden
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:12.080]  you get charges.
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:17.840]  Yeah, I can sum this up in two words, which hunt, which hunt three.
[1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:22.520]  Just the fact that Adam Schiff is on the committee, tells you the committee is bogus.
[1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:27.200]  Why would Speaker Pelosi not allow any actual Republican Trump supporters on this committee?
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:28.200]  Because it's a fraud.
[1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:32.760]  It is a political witch hunt of the worst magnitude.
[1:28:32.760 --> 1:28:37.240]  When we get back, we can talk about that and talk about where the country and the party
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:38.240]  is headed.
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:43.360]  It's just great to be back with you, and it's like our old days at the war room.
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.340]  That's Roger Stone.
[1:28:45.340 --> 1:28:47.160]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:51.400]  We've got to take a break right now, but when we come back, we've got more January 6th news,
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:52.400]  folks.
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:53.400]  It gets worse.
[1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:54.840]  It actually gets worse.
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:59.240]  If you can believe that, we'll be right back.
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:04.840]  I've been on air more than 25 years, and long before I started selling high quality vitamin
[1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:12.240]  D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:17.200]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:22.200]  it doesn't matter, your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that
[1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:23.200]  are out there.
[1:29:23.200 --> 1:29:24.440]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:26.160]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:28.640]  You die in five or six days without water.
[1:29:28.640 --> 1:29:30.200]  You die in a month without food.
[1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:35.320]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:36.320]  you need.
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:40.440]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[1:29:40.440 --> 1:29:45.520]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:51.960]  defenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[1:30:06.320 --> 1:30:09.920]  for months at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:13.680]  Winter sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken under the tongue.
[1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:17.640]  It also has vitamin K, critical for your immune system and so much more.
[1:30:17.640 --> 1:30:21.640]  It's 50% off, despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody
[1:30:21.640 --> 1:30:23.120]  needs this.
[1:30:23.120 --> 1:30:24.880]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:31.040]  You need what's in winter sun and then we have brain force, ultra, super fast acting,
[1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:37.960]  amazing, clean, neutropic system that is a compliment to brain force plus and of course
[1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:39.200]  turbo force.
[1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:43.480]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and take
[1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:46.640]  your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:51.600]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:52.600]  Thank you all for your support.
[1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:59.520]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:06.960]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:10.160]  until the populations rebelled.
[1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:15.680]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[1:31:15.680 --> 1:31:21.240]  anybody that speaks out against their lives, but because of so many scientists and engineers
[1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:26.960]  and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is
[1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:33.960]  falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover
[1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:37.360]  and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:31:37.360 --> 1:31:41.720]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:31:41.720 --> 1:31:48.560]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas
[1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:50.520]  of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:52.400]  So pray for these folks big time.
[1:31:52.400 --> 1:31:57.200]  This is a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowarstore.com because truth is
[1:31:57.200 --> 1:31:59.440]  absolutely paramount.
[1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:06.840]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery.
[1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:13.160]  A symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations
[1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:14.160]  has put in place.
[1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:20.160]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:25.480]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:28.360]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:36.520]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:42.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now, the entire future destiny of humanity
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:43.920]  is upon us.
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:47.880]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:50.720]  the world ID and carbon taxes.
[1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:52.880]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:32:52.880 --> 1:33:00.920]  They only get better if we resist and say no, noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:33:00.920 --> 1:33:14.520]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:23.400]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation, it's Oren Troyer.
[1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:29.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:34.960]  And we've got Roger Stone with us live.
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:36.640]  And folks, it does get worse.
[1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:42.040]  Well, I mean, I don't know if it's worse than a man being bullied into suicide by liberal
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:43.640]  Democrats that claim to be anti-bullying.
[1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:46.960]  It's amazing they'll bully someone into suicide and celebrate.
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:54.640]  But they're now going after innocent people's families, and that's mine.
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:34:00.640]  And so, as far as I know, as the situation stands, I am still the only individual who
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:06.680]  never stepped foot in the Capitol, never touched a police officer, never touched a barrier,
[1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:11.280]  never touched anything that day, and I'm facing charges.
[1:34:11.280 --> 1:34:16.000]  And now, add another thing that I'm the only one of, they're now going after my family.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:21.560]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, everybody knows I keep my private life private.
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:24.840]  And when I learned of these developments a couple of weeks ago, I said, I'm not going
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:25.840]  to report on it.
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:27.800]  I don't want to get my family involved in this.
[1:34:27.800 --> 1:34:29.640]  I don't want to get my mother involved in this.
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:31.120]  They didn't ask for this.
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:33.520]  They're not involved at all.
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:38.080]  Now the January 6th Committee has subpoenaed my mother.
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:43.160]  And they write stories like this, January 6th Select Committee subpoenaed phone records
[1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:47.800]  of the mother whose son works for Alex Jones and breached the Capitol last year.
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:49.080]  Never breached the Capitol.
[1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:50.080]  Never happened.
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:52.000]  And yet the Daily Mail publishes this story.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.040]  It's like, I've got a stack of news.
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:57.600]  I hate litigation just like Roger Stone, but I'm reaching the point where it's like, how
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:00.440]  do I punch back against these, these a-holes?
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:04.080]  I've got a stack of news that I'll add this to where when all this is said and done, I'm
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:06.080]  probably going to be suing for defamation.
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:12.160]  I never went in the Capitol building Daily Mail, retract your story now, or face a lawsuit
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:14.680]  in the future.
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:19.720]  And then they say, oh, oh, Instroyer's mother and associate of Alex Jones, my mother has
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:21.400]  never been to Austin, Texas.
[1:35:21.400 --> 1:35:23.120]  She's never met anybody that works here.
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:24.840]  She's never done anything here.
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:29.920]  She's a saint and she's a very well-known in her little community as a great person.
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:36.320]  I mean, doesn't curse, doesn't drink, I mean, just, and now they're bringing her into this.
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:39.360]  So I didn't want to talk about it, but here it is, Roger.
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:42.640]  I mean, so they're bullying people into suicide.
[1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:46.680]  Now they're coming after my family, my family, Roger.
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:52.920]  This is, this is mafia gangster tactics that our government is now involved in.
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:53.920]  Yeah.
[1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:55.080]  It is absolutely outrageous.
[1:35:55.080 --> 1:36:00.240]  My first of all, Owen, you should know that I am praying for you in your case the same
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:02.560]  way you prayed for me in mine.
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:08.960]  And we prayed together in Washington and ultimately thanks to the grace of God, thanks to the
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:14.000]  power of Jesus Christ, thanks to Donald Trump having the courage and the fortitude in an
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:17.320]  election year to grant me a pardon.
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:24.280]  I'm not already dead of COVID in a dank Georgia prison, which was the game plan of the New
[1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:28.960]  World Order and those who prosecuted me.
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:32.080]  Your case seems to me to be a travesty.
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:34.880]  I can't figure out what you allegedly did wrong.
[1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:37.960]  In fact, I think you did nothing wrong.
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:39.400]  You didn't hurt anybody.
[1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:40.400]  You didn't break anything.
[1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:41.720]  You didn't steal anything.
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:43.320]  You didn't go into the Capitol.
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:48.880]  You didn't break into the Capitol, your mere presence on the outskirts of the Capitol,
[1:36:48.880 --> 1:36:54.520]  which by the way is the people's house, they've now decided is a crime and it is despicable
[1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:58.000]  that they are seeking the phone records of your mother.
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:03.860]  What would that possibly prove that you called your mother that day, recognize that when they
[1:37:03.860 --> 1:37:09.480]  seek your phone records, all they learn is that you called her or that she called you
[1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:12.640]  or who else she may have spoke to that day.
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:15.920]  It is an outrage, but I felt this outrage.
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:22.600]  When my wife was attacked physically outside our home two Christmases ago by some lunatics
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:28.440]  screaming that I was a Russian piece of crap, yeah, I find that offensive.
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:35.680]  When my granddaughter was about to give birth to my great grandson in Akron, Ohio, I don't
[1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:40.600]  know who the Cretan is who called her hotel room and said, if you're Roger Stone's daughter,
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:43.580]  I hope your child is stillborn.
[1:37:43.580 --> 1:37:47.680]  I don't know who would say that to a pregnant woman in her twenties.
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:50.240]  What kind of creep would do that?
[1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:54.840]  But that's the tolerant American left today.
[1:37:54.840 --> 1:37:56.920]  That's where we're coming from.
[1:37:56.920 --> 1:38:04.880]  I guess the real thing here, Owen, is that at least you and I, having some public presence,
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:10.840]  having a following because of our activities on reporting on what's going on in the country,
[1:38:10.840 --> 1:38:16.960]  we're at least able to raise the resources necessary to put up a legal defense, to put
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.800]  up a legal fight.
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:27.040]  What about those people currently languishing in jail in D.C. in filthy rat infested conditions
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:33.320]  where their civil rights are being systematically violated, essentially in a gulag?
[1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:34.880]  What about them?
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:42.280]  The details that I get about the treatment of these prisoners is horrific, but they can't
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:48.920]  afford lawyers like you can afford, like I can afford, and therefore something must be
[1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:51.400]  done about this.
[1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:54.640]  This is something that I'm wrestling with.
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:39:00.000]  President Trump, God bless him, could raise every penny they need for their legal defense
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:05.240]  so that they can have a fair trial, so they can have due process.
[1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:07.240]  So far, he hasn't done that.
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:09.760]  I hope he changes his mind.
[1:39:09.760 --> 1:39:13.880]  His lawyers may be telling him to stay away from the detainees, but there's no reason
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:15.560]  to do that.
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:20.200]  They were exercising their First Amendment rights, the right to free assembly, the right
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:25.120]  to redress the government, until they made the strategic mistake of trespassing.
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:30.560]  And again, as you point out, the only deaths associated with what the left calls the most
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:35.520]  deadly attack on the country since Pearl Harbor is at the hands of the Capitol Hill police.
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:39.680]  I'm sorry, Michael Burt is a murderer, and he should be tried for murder.
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:40.840]  He's not a hero.
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:42.360]  He shouldn't be deified.
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:47.080]  He wasn't even questioned in the cold-blooded murder of Ashley Babbitt.
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:52.960]  We've now seen video of Ashley Babbitt urging people not to break the windows.
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:53.960]  She was unarmed.
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:40:00.280]  It was a danger to know, and Michael Burt must stand trial for murder sooner or later.
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:06.960]  So I am hopeful I'm praying that we'll have a change in Washington, a change of leadership
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:07.960]  in Washington.
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:13.600]  But I'm also very clear, just winning a Republican control of the House is not going to bring
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:15.760]  the change we need.
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:20.080]  Just putting the rhinos in firm control of the House and the Senate is not going to bring
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:22.400]  the change we need.
[1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:28.400]  Once you get new leadership in Washington, new leadership specifically in the House,
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:34.240]  leadership that will, for example, expel Eric Swalwell from the House of Representatives.
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:38.600]  For two years, Eric Swalwell said I was a Russian spy.
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:44.560]  Now it turns out that he was penetrating a red Chinese spy who in turn penetrated his
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:46.480]  office with an intern.
[1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:53.520]  So here's a guy with full and complete access to national security information, a guy with
[1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:58.560]  a security clearance as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, consorting with known
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:05.000]  Russian spies, yet there are no repercussions, yet Nancy Pelosi leaves him in place.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.240]  Where is justice?
[1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:08.320]  When will justice be done?
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:11.680]  That leads to my next question, Roger.
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:18.120]  The conservative side of the media is pretty much abandoning all the political prisoners
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:24.000]  from January 6, all those in the gulags, except for a few names that I think we all know,
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:27.560]  like a Tucker Carlson or here at Info Wars or Gateway Pundit and some others.
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:32.160]  But most mainstream conservative commentators in the media, they're not touching it.
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:36.360]  The Republican Party, maybe there's five, six Republicans that have spoken up about the
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:39.440]  political persecution of the January 6 defendants.
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:42.600]  I mean, where's the conservative media?
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:43.720]  Where are the Republicans?
[1:41:43.720 --> 1:41:50.880]  Why are they letting us down in such a giant way for this clear, this clear and present
[1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:54.280]  political persecution and torture?
[1:41:54.280 --> 1:41:58.560]  I think back to the action of conservative media, I should say the reaction when Alex
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:05.080]  Jones was first censored when he was removed from Facebook, from Spotify, from Instagram
[1:42:05.080 --> 1:42:06.840]  and so on.
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:07.840]  They were silent.
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:10.120]  They said nothing, they did nothing.
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:15.360]  They didn't realize that this would eventually happen to them, which of course now it has.
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:18.200]  This is a very similar situation.
[1:42:18.200 --> 1:42:25.360]  Great peace by a reporter in the Sarasota Herald Tribune, completely incorrect, by the
[1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:31.360]  way, in which he said that the Republican Party wants to move on from the 2020 election.
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:36.360]  Not according to the polling that I have seen in Nevada and Pennsylvania and Oklahoma and
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:37.360]  New Jersey.
[1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:39.760]  In fact, it is the number one issue.
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:40.760]  Election integrity.
[1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:44.160]  No, I'm sorry, the voters don't want to stop talking about it.
[1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:48.320]  Only the party elites interested in lining their pockets in a go along to get a long
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:52.000]  deal with the House Democrats want to stop talking about this.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.920]  But Owen, you and I, we're going to keep talking about it on the other side.
[1:42:56.920 --> 1:43:02.600]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:07.280]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:09.280]  and thank goodness for InfowarsStore.com.
[1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:15.400]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need
[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:16.400]  to get going.
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:20.880]  You know, besides the energy Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like
[1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:26.080]  vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:29.640]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:43:29.640 --> 1:43:33.280]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore list.
[1:43:33.280 --> 1:43:34.880]  I have bad joints.
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:35.880]  Thanks mom.
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:40.280]  This is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:42.680]  support and extra flexibility.
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:47.240]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:51.920]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force, that can
[1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:55.960]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:43:58.960]  you moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:01.520]  This is a great sponsor.
[1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:06.280]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:07.280]  satellite phone.
[1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:11.320]  So you can't be tracked, you can't be traced, and it will work anywhere in the world where
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:12.320]  you can see the sky.
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:15.800]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car and your house that also are
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:16.800]  on the site.
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:19.880]  Infowarsphone.com, that's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:23.200]  They supply the board for all everybody, but their systems as well, they're amazing
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:31.000]  folks and you get a free phone, a $600 to $50 value, absolutely free at Infowarsphone.com.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.200]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:34.200]  These aren't.
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:35.600]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:40.400]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes.
[1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:43.360]  So the calls, they were free, it was like a regular cell phone, they're not being tracked
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:44.360]  or traced.
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:45.360]  And I keep one in my car.
[1:44:45.360 --> 1:44:48.480]  I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:49.480]  don't work, they work.
[1:44:49.480 --> 1:45:01.520]  So if you're looking for more information on Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020

[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:07.480]  Granny Do Right.
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:08.480]  Granny Do Right.
[1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:09.480]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:10.480]  Go ahead.
[1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:11.480]  Yeah, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:14.480]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:19.440]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or H-spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:26.120]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:29.440]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:33.480]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:37.040]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:41.600]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[1:45:41.600 --> 1:45:46.640]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is working, this
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:47.640]  is wonderful.
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:54.120]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:59.000]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:03.600]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:07.960]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:12.120]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:19.200]  We see the entire global corrupt into human depopulation, great recent combine, trying
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:25.800]  to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:32.320]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:38.400]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:41.040]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:46.240]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:48.280]  silenced and gas lit.
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:52.320]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence, and that's
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:56.200]  why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[1:46:56.200 --> 1:47:01.120]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:24.880]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:32.720]  Roger Stone is with us here on the Alex Jones show, and I want to get into tonight's State
[1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:37.160]  of the Union with Roger.
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:41.200]  We do have some interesting news here.
[1:47:41.200 --> 1:47:45.840]  You have, I mean, here's how they're, here's the momentum build up, if you will, obviously
[1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:52.360]  the Biden flation, the empty shelves, the war with Ukraine, the political prisoners,
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:54.480]  Biden taking a vacation every weekend.
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:01.320]  I mean, just all the utter failures, and then yesterday, Jill Biden introduced Kamala Harris
[1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:03.480]  as the president of the United States.
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:08.960]  I mean, it's just total embarrassment at every level for these crooks that occupy the
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:11.680]  White House right now, the Biden administration.
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:15.640]  So Roger, Biden's set to give his first State of the Union tonight.
[1:48:15.640 --> 1:48:20.240]  First of all, he slurs and stumbles and fumbles and forgets his way through all these other
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:21.240]  speeches.
[1:48:21.240 --> 1:48:24.320]  How do you think this one is going to go?
[1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:30.240]  And has there ever been a point in all of your experience covering American politics?
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:34.040]  Has there ever been a point where, because what I expect tonight is Biden's going to
[1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:40.640]  have to address all the issues that he caused, the high prices, the gas prices, the inflation,
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:41.800]  the war on Ukraine.
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:47.000]  He's going to have to address all these things that he caused, that he's responsible for.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:50.880]  Has that dynamic ever been part of a State of the Union before?
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:54.440]  I mean, this is going to be quite a show tonight.
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:49:00.320]  Oh, and I remember when my own great-grandmother had dementia.
[1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:05.160]  And when she had dementia, she had good days and bad days.
[1:49:05.160 --> 1:49:07.600]  She had days in which she was a bit more lucid.
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:12.720]  She had days in which she had no idea where she was or what her condition was.
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:15.920]  I think that is the situation surrounding Joe Biden.
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:21.000]  Now it is indisputable that he crapped his pants when he went to visit the Pope.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:26.280]  You can see not only from sources in the Vatican, but you can see photographs in which the suit
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:30.680]  jacket he's wearing and the early photographs match the trousers he's wearing.
[1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:34.840]  And then minutes later, he has a different color trouser on.
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:37.560]  So I don't think he's controlling the country.
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:41.880]  I'm not even sure he can control his own bowels.
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:45.120]  Anything that's wrong in the country will be blamed on Donald Trump.
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:46.400]  That you can bet on.
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:53.080]  I'm not sure how you put a good face on gas prices.
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:57.200]  I'm not sure how you put a good face on the fact that you can go to the grocery store
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:49:59.880]  and many of the shelves are empty.
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:05.240]  I'm sorry, in the wealthiest, most prosperous country in the world, I rather doubt that
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:07.720]  we have a shortage of chicken wings.
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:10.280]  I don't think that's the case.
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:14.680]  So my guess is what you're going to get tonight is going to be almost overwhelmingly about
[1:50:14.680 --> 1:50:15.680]  Ukraine.
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:21.640]  It's going to be overwhelmingly pushing the false narrative that we have to defend the
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:26.240]  Ukrainian border when we don't even defend our own border.
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:30.440]  They're interested in the sanctity of the Ukrainian border, but they have no concerns
[1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:35.440]  about the fact that hundreds of thousands of illegals are flooding across our southern
[1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:36.600]  border.
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:38.600]  All of them, by the way, unvaccinated.
[1:50:38.600 --> 1:50:41.440]  And yes, Donald Trump is right.
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:43.480]  They're involved in drug trafficking.
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:46.320]  They're involved in human trafficking.
[1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:47.320]  It is a tragedy.
[1:50:47.320 --> 1:50:51.480]  By the way, I'm waiting for the governor of Texas, who has both the authority and the
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:54.720]  manpower to seal our border to do that.
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:58.560]  I guess I will continue to wait in vain.
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:02.160]  So my guess is you're going to get the war drums tonight.
[1:51:02.160 --> 1:51:05.840]  What you're going to get is a constant attack.
[1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:10.800]  He's not going to address the fact that if the Ukrainians would simply agree not to put
[1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:18.200]  Western missiles in their country, if they would shut down the reported U.S.-funded biolabs
[1:51:18.200 --> 1:51:22.840]  in their country, God knows what kind of pestilence they're cooking up.
[1:51:22.840 --> 1:51:27.920]  This matter could be resolved in much of the way that President John Kennedy resolved the
[1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:34.280]  Cuban missile crisis in 1962, short of World War III.
[1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:36.880]  Watching CNN is laughable.
[1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:41.880]  I mean, it is Tokyo Rose-level war propaganda.
[1:51:41.880 --> 1:51:48.480]  Speaking of that, Owen, I do have to comment on the CNN special on Alex Jones Sunday night.
[1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:51.520]  The most laughable piece of fiction I've ever seen.
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:53.080]  So they did end up airing that.
[1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:54.080]  I hadn't seen it.
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:55.840]  I thought they just totally canceled it.
[1:51:55.840 --> 1:51:58.280]  They didn't end up airing that.
[1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:00.400]  My understanding was that they did.
[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:03.000]  I'm told that I was mentioned prominently.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:07.120]  Now, perhaps that's fake information, but let me say this.
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:11.760]  If they do air it, people at airports across the country are going to stop and see about
[1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:15.480]  three minutes of it because there is no one else watching.
[1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:20.720]  I don't get my news from CNN for the same reason that I don't eat out of the toilet.
[1:52:20.720 --> 1:52:23.880]  So I read that it was on at six and again at nine.
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:30.080]  I did not catch it, but I was told just on the basis of the questions that were posed
[1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:35.640]  to Alex Jones after the documentary was already in the can, of course, in which his answers
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:39.720]  to their questions just have no impact at all revealed an epic bias.
[1:52:39.720 --> 1:52:46.520]  Now, I know some on the left were upset that the documentary could have the effect of making
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:52:53.680]  Alex Jones even bigger, which I rather liked, but their promotion of it was relentless.
[1:52:53.680 --> 1:53:00.040]  I saw it promoted for, you know, over and over and ever again, megaphone for conspiracy.
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:01.040]  Oh, yeah.
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:03.320]  They were running it in all the breaks like it was a big buildup.
[1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:04.320]  Yeah.
[1:53:04.320 --> 1:53:06.760]  Well, it would be disappointing if it didn't air.
[1:53:06.760 --> 1:53:12.120]  I had heard reports that it was, it was brutal on the other hand when I spoke directly to
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:14.200]  Alex, he said, I'm going to bed.
[1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:15.520]  I'm not watching this trash.
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:16.520]  Yeah.
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:19.160]  That's the thing is, I guess, I guess we don't, we can't really confirm what happened
[1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:24.080]  because nobody watches, literally nobody is watching CNN.
[1:53:24.080 --> 1:53:29.680]  And I guess they haven't figured it out yet, Roger, where getting attacked by CNN.
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:31.880]  That's like, that's an honor.
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:35.520]  That's like a greater honor than getting a Nobel Peace Prize in the year 2022.
[1:53:35.520 --> 1:53:37.800]  Like, please, CNN, attack me all day.
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:39.840]  Like, thank you, please.
[1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:47.560]  Well, as you know, they were there for my arrest on the 25th of January, 2019.
[1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:50.520]  I guess you never found out who tipped them off to that, by the way.
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:51.520]  Yeah.
[1:53:51.520 --> 1:53:53.040]  No, we certainly didn't, Andrew Weisman.
[1:53:53.040 --> 1:53:54.520]  Oh, look, this is really simple.
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:54:02.160]  I was arrested at 616 in the morning at 611, Sarah Murray of CNN sent my attorney, Grant
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:05.160]  Smith, a copy of my sealed indictment.
[1:54:05.160 --> 1:54:08.800]  That indictment had no timestamps on it, no court markings.
[1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:12.200]  It was sealed until 9 30th in the morning.
[1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:15.320]  Sarah Murray's possession of that is a felony.
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:18.960]  The claim that CNN got it online is disproved with the time of year.
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:20.560]  That is a lie.
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:22.120]  It is absolutely false.
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:27.000]  If you look at the metadata tag on my indictment, it was written by Andrew Weisman.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:32.840]  Therefore, Weisman is the one who leaked my arrest and the execution of a search warrant
[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:35.880]  to CNN, a felony.
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:40.320]  But that's probably the high water mark in terms of their ratings.
[1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:44.680]  Every day I run into people who saw my arrest on television.
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:50.880]  Many of them, not even Trump supporters, but who were outraged that we spent $1.1 million
[1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:56.680]  of the taxpayers' money to arrest me in the manner in which I was arrested for the completely
[1:54:56.680 --> 1:55:01.200]  fabricated crime of lying to Congress about Russian collusion.
[1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:05.800]  By the way, Owen, how do you lie about something that we now know definitively never actually
[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:06.800]  happened?
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:10.400]  Except in the Hillary Clinton campaign, we know that it did happen there.
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:15.800]  And I don't say this gleefully because it's the American taxpayer being robbed.
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:18.320]  But I mean, let's be clear here.
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:23.160]  Between Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and Owen Schreuer, the U.S. government has spent tens
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:26.640]  of millions of dollars in persecuting us.
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:31.760]  I mean, seriously, tens of millions of dollars, folks, the government, your tax money, tens
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:36.160]  of millions persecuting Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and Owen Schreuer, just three people
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:38.800]  alone who are totally innocent of any crimes.
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.760]  Meanwhile, we have veterans who are homeless in this country.
[1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:45.600]  We have veterans who are hungry in this country.
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:48.720]  We have veterans who don't get medical care in this country.
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:54.160]  But we are spending unlimited monies on persecuting us.
[1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:59.280]  Last Friday, Friday before last, pardon me, the Department of Justice released a report
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:06.120]  that said that Robert Mueller declined to prosecute Roger Stone for cybercrimes.
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:10.080]  Nowhere in their statement do they point out that he declined to prosecute me because
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:14.280]  he had no evidence whatsoever of any cybercrimes.
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:20.120]  I gather that this release was meant to blunt the stunning news that we now know is an absolute
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:26.160]  certainty, which indicates that Hillary Clinton did spy on Donald Trump.
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:31.160]  One of the worst scumbags in the media, a guy named Glenn Kessler at The Washington Post,
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:34.640]  has an epically hysterical piece in which he tries to spin out of this.
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:39.960]  I don't know, that is all the creation of a fiction by that great patriot, Cash Patel,
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:43.320]  who worked as a counsel to the House Intelligence Committee Republicans.
[1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:45.120]  No, it's a fact.
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:46.280]  Hillary's busted.
[1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:48.880]  The more she talks, the more obvious it is.
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:52.860]  You know, the Democrats want her wrong gone as well as much as we do.
[1:56:52.860 --> 1:56:57.160]  The idea that she would run again in 2024 is a bigger nightmare for the Democrats than
[1:56:57.160 --> 1:56:59.840]  it would be for the Republicans.
[1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:01.720]  I mean, I'm almost hoping to see that.
[1:57:01.720 --> 1:57:07.360]  I mean, you want to talk about reanimated beef jerky versus reanimated raw liver, Hillary
[1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:09.200]  Clinton versus Joe Biden in a debate.
[1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:13.640]  I mean, that, wow, I mean, that's to bring him out of the caskets because the vampire
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:14.800]  debate is on.
[1:57:14.800 --> 1:57:19.080]  Roger Stone will all be watching the State of the Union to see what kind of flummoxes
[1:57:19.080 --> 1:57:20.080]  Biden has.
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:23.640]  I think that your prediction is very acute.
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:26.360]  I do think he'll make it all about banging the war drums.
[1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:27.960]  Usually State of the Union lasts about an hour.
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:29.800]  I'll be surprised if he makes it 30 minutes.
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:35.040]  Roger Stone, great stuff as always, StoneDefense.com, StoneColdTruth.com, you're a great American
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:37.440]  patriot, Roger, and I love you.
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:38.440]  God bless you all.
[1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:39.440]  I'm great to be with you.
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:41.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:42.440]  There goes Roger Stone.
[1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:48.840]  When we come back, we're going to get into some of these video clips and news.
[1:57:48.840 --> 1:57:51.760]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:57.480]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:04.600]  people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential and if you're not getting sunshine every single
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:08.040]  day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:12.520]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:14.080]  It's just like you need oxygen.
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:15.800]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:18.280]  You die in five or six days without water.
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:19.880]  You die in a month without food.
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:24.920]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:26.000]  you need.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:29.480]  One of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin
[1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:30.480]  D3.
[1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:35.120]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's

[1:58:53.360 --> 1:58:57.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[1:58:57.160 --> 1:59:00.720]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:59:00.720 --> 1:59:02.720]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:59:02.720 --> 1:59:04.680]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:10.040]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it
[1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:14.640]  does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:15.640]  system.
[1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:21.640]  So, X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available
[1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:25.280]  again at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:25.280 --> 1:59:29.120]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about
[1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:33.480]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:59:33.480 --> 1:59:36.320]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:40.360]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[1:59:40.360 --> 1:59:41.360]  what it does for your body.
[1:59:41.360 --> 1:59:46.080]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[1:59:46.080 --> 2:00:02.480]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off.
[2:00:02.480 --> 2:00:10.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, there's just so much news here.
[2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:18.800]  I'm just overwhelmed at where to begin.
[2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:22.960]  So what I think we're going to do here, and I'll come back and just kind of re-intro
[2:00:22.960 --> 2:00:29.160]  the show in the next segment when a lot of our TV and radio stations pick us back up.
[2:00:29.160 --> 2:00:35.840]  But what I think I'll do here is just play all these video clips in the next two segments.
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:40.560]  And I'm just going to have to do all the news on the war room when I have just three hours
[2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:49.680]  clear itself to just really get into this news and properly lay it out in a linear fashion
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:54.080]  with the deep analysis that I need to do.
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:57.880]  So that's what we're going to do is I'm going to get into all the big news out of Ukraine
[2:00:57.880 --> 2:00:58.880]  and Russia.
[2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:02.600]  I'm going to get into all the big news out of the CDC and everything.
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:05.240]  But I'll just reintroduce that in the next segment.
[2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:06.240]  Let's go to this clip, though.
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:17.680]  The latest John Bowne report, guys, clip 16, and the pedo bureaucracy.
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:22.000]  The scumbags that prey on America's children are multiplying.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:25.120]  They are so brazen that they hunt them on social media.
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:27.360]  Danny, no, I need your help now.
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:28.360]  We're not here to fight you.
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:29.360]  It doesn't look like we're trying to fight you.
[2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:30.360]  We're on the registry.
[2:01:30.360 --> 2:01:32.360]  You were masturbating to the 13-year-old girl.
[2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:33.360]  Got you.
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:34.360]  Can you come and get me, Danny?
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:35.360]  I'm in the video chat.
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:36.360]  Help me, Danny.
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:39.040]  Danny, will you come help him?
[2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:42.480]  Sometimes they're even the developers of those platforms.
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:46.600]  So when he told you he was 13, what was you thinking?
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:48.920]  I didn't know exactly.
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:53.440]  I thought maybe it was someone in trouble if they were reaching out and thought they knew
[2:01:53.440 --> 2:01:54.440]  me.
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:57.040]  So I was like, I'll continue this conversation.
[2:01:57.040 --> 2:02:01.240]  You didn't even, you weren't even like, whoa, you're 13, don't talk to me?
[2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:02.240]  Yes, of course.
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:07.920]  Because you're not once in this whole conversation expressed or he expressed that he was in any
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:08.920]  kind of trouble.
[2:02:08.920 --> 2:02:11.960]  So he never told you that he was in any kind of trouble.
[2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:16.160]  So I wouldn't say that for your defense, but we'll keep going.
[2:02:16.160 --> 2:02:19.560]  And he said, better watch my language with you.
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:21.200]  And he said, why?
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:22.760]  Because you're a young man, you said.
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:26.920]  A Vancouver teacher has been implicated in a child pornography ring.
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:31.680]  Police in Australia have announced the arrest of 11 people, two are Canadians.
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:35.800]  Ms. Teresa LaLonde reports the ring allegedly operated through Facebook.
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:40.400]  If we can stop it at that initial point, then we can lessen the impact on the child and
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:47.200]  hopefully, you know, lessen the distribution of their images and videos of them being tortured.
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:50.880]  Facebook would deactivate the suspect's site, but not contact police.
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:54.320]  The suspects would simply set up a new account in a different name.
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:02:55.840]  They are their teachers.
[2:02:55.840 --> 2:02:58.880]  They are in top positions in law enforcement.
[2:02:58.880 --> 2:03:03.520]  These two individuals, a deputy in Livingston Parish and his teacher wife, who was a middle
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:06.800]  school teacher, got caught by Adobe.
[2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:08.600]  They were photoshopping things.
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:13.720]  Adobe turned them into authorities in Louisiana, which launched an investigation.
[2:03:13.720 --> 2:03:16.960]  Authorities with the Attorney General's office showed up at the couple's house.
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:23.520]  They found this safe full of hard drives, computers, thumb drives, things like that.
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:28.400]  And all of it was encrypted with a software called Keep My Data Safe.
[2:03:28.400 --> 2:03:32.680]  So essentially, they had to come in and decode everything, and when they decoded everything,
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:34.080]  they were alarmed at what they saw.
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:36.920]  They saw child porn, they saw child rape.
[2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:43.080]  They also saw what appeared to be this deputy who was ejaculating on sweets that were then
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:46.360]  being served to his wife's class.
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:51.040]  They are in the tax-fueled bureaucracy that runs our lives.
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:55.320]  The Defense Department releasing brand new details into an investigation involving child
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:04:00.160]  pornography and dozens of its workers and contractors, some with top-level security
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:01.440]  clearance.
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:05.320]  Not only are these very serious accusations, but investigators say some of the people involved
[2:04:05.320 --> 2:04:08.040]  were handling the nation's most sensitive secrets.
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:12.640]  Take a look at this, for instance, the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance
[2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:18.240]  Office and the very secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
[2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:23.440]  Others also worked on actual military installations, including Edwards Air Force Base in California
[2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:27.640]  and also the California-based Naval Air Warfare Center.
[2:04:27.640 --> 2:04:32.360]  So they had access to military secrets in some cases and military hardware.
[2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:39.760]  Department of Defense computers are being misused to share, to spread, to access child
[2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:40.760]  pornography.
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:46.440]  The Department of Defense does not have an adequate way of responding to this, of tracking
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:51.840]  down and investigating who is an individual is misusing these computers, who is sharing
[2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:59.760]  these pornographic images of children, who is sending them to whom.
[2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:05.200]  I stay on air selling high-quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're
[2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:06.600]  going to be happy with.
[2:05:06.600 --> 2:05:09.560]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:11.200]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:15.760]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalist, and I'm able to do that because
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:18.200]  you buy products at infowarestore.com.
[2:05:18.200 --> 2:05:22.440]  And listen, all the products are great, but when it comes to high-quality, storeable food
[2:05:22.440 --> 2:05:28.880]  in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360
[2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:33.360]  win, hey, no brainer, and they've got high-quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right
[2:05:33.360 --> 2:05:34.360]  now.
[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:38.840]  The great folks at my favorite supply, exclusively, prepare with alex.com, discount it.
[2:05:38.840 --> 2:05:43.440]  So again, be in inflation, be prepared, fund the Info War, the only way you lose is not
[2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:48.880]  taking action at infowarstore.com, or prepare with alex.com right now.
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:05:52.600]  This is high-quality, storeable food, this is how you beat inflation.
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:53.600]  Get yours today.
[2:05:53.600 --> 2:05:57.360]  It's ready to ship, but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation
[2:05:57.360 --> 2:05:58.360]  is exploding.
[2:05:58.360 --> 2:06:07.600]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[2:06:07.600 --> 2:06:12.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:15.320]  And now, your host, Owen Schreuer.
[2:06:15.320 --> 2:06:24.960]  All right, let me hit the reset button real quick here on this March 1 edition of the
[2:06:24.960 --> 2:06:30.600]  Alex Jones show, year 2022.
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:31.920]  I've got another guest coming up.
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.920]  Today's show, just, it's been a little clunky because Alex hosted the first hour, and then
[2:06:36.920 --> 2:06:40.760]  the great Roger Stone in the second hour, and I got another guest coming up here in the
[2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:41.920]  third hour.
[2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:47.640]  So there was just no chance for me to properly get into this information and dissect it and
[2:06:47.640 --> 2:06:51.800]  analyze it with that format.
[2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:56.400]  So I'm hosting the war room today, 3 to 6 p.m., my normal duties.
[2:06:56.400 --> 2:07:02.240]  I'm going to properly get into all the news and analysis and commentary that I have on
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:08.080]  my desk here in the three hours on the war room because that's the thing is, I need a
[2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:14.720]  full three hours to do a college level course evaluation on all of this, and it's going
[2:07:14.720 --> 2:07:15.720]  to take three hours.
[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:19.920]  It might not even be enough time with the breaks included.
[2:07:19.920 --> 2:07:20.920]  But that's the plan.
[2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:27.120]  Now, I'm going to get to a bunch of these video clips in the meantime that hover over
[2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:35.240]  all of this news, that kind of give you the taste and flavor for it in sights and sounds.
[2:07:35.240 --> 2:07:38.480]  So that's what we're going to do here, and then Jake Ducey is going to join me in just
[2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:40.000]  30 minutes.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:44.880]  But ladies and gentlemen, with all the news here and all the information, we're not even
[2:07:44.880 --> 2:07:51.000]  doing a proper job plugging how we stay on air at infowarstore.com because we're just
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:54.520]  so obsessed with the news and information that it's like we don't even think about,
[2:07:54.520 --> 2:07:59.800]  hey, we got to fund ourselves to keep ourselves on air here, but that is the case.
[2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:07.480]  Now we make it easy, we've got top rated top level supplements at infowarstore.com, many
[2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:12.320]  of which are at a deep discount right now, like Winterson Plus, which we can barely even
[2:08:12.320 --> 2:08:13.320]  keep in stock.
[2:08:13.320 --> 2:08:15.560]  This stuff sells out so quickly.
[2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:18.920]  Brainforce Ultra, same thing, sells out really fast.
[2:08:18.920 --> 2:08:19.920]  That's 40% off.
[2:08:19.920 --> 2:08:23.440]  Winterson Plus, 50% off.
[2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:32.320]  But it's supplements that are going to give you the opportunity to be as healthy as possible.
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:38.160]  That's our goal because we know you're under chemical biological attack long before the
[2:08:38.160 --> 2:08:43.040]  vaccines even came out for COVID or they made the bio weapon in the lab that they released
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:46.080]  with the chemicals in the food and the water.
[2:08:46.080 --> 2:08:53.320]  That's why we said, hey, let's combat the attack on your body with vitamins and minerals
[2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:59.920]  and supplements that are going to combat that attack and then turbocharge your immune system
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:06.920]  and your health to be in the best health you can possibly be in, in this poisoned planet
[2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:09.960]  that we currently live on.
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:12.560]  So it's infowarstore.com.
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:18.720]  I hear about people all the time that don't filter their water and I'm just aghast.
[2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:21.080]  I'm just stunned, quite frankly.
[2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:27.000]  And these are smart people that politically align with me and I say, hey, you don't filter
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  your water.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  You're drinking the fluoride.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:30.720]  You're drinking the glyphosate.
[2:09:30.720 --> 2:09:34.200]  You're drinking all the chemicals and everything that's been found in there and they just don't
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:40.240]  even really realize it or think twice and I show them the studies and it's like this
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:41.240]  common sense thing.
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:44.080]  It's like, oh yeah, of course this water is toxic.
[2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:45.360]  Of course they add these things.
[2:09:45.360 --> 2:09:47.760]  Why haven't I been filtering my water?
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:55.600]  Get our water filters at infowarstore.com and look, believe me, nobody wants to see
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:57.640]  the collapse of the economy.
[2:09:57.640 --> 2:09:59.560]  Nobody wants to see the collapse of the supply chain.
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:02.800]  Nobody wants to see another great depression or anything like that.
[2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:07.560]  But I mean, these are things that can help you in that situation.
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:10.960]  Water filters, emergency food supplies, I mean, these are going to be things you're
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:15.880]  going to want if we do reach another great depression-like scenario, which will be totally
[2:10:15.880 --> 2:10:20.760]  synthetic obviously, it's called the Great Reset.
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:22.480]  But that's how you support us.
[2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:24.120]  That's how we stay on air.
[2:10:24.120 --> 2:10:29.480]  It's infowarstore.com from the hats and the t-shirts to the supplements to the air filters
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:32.040]  and the water filters and everything else in between.
[2:10:32.040 --> 2:10:36.240]  You shopping at infowarstore.com makes everything we do here possible.
[2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:40.880]  So we thank you for that and we encourage you to continue to do your shopping at infowarstore.com.
[2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:45.080]  All right, with that, let's go to a couple of these clips here.
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:51.240]  You know, Russell Brand has been doing really amazing work and now obviously he's a classical
[2:10:51.240 --> 2:10:52.240]  liberal.
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:53.240]  He's well known as a liberal.
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:58.020]  He doesn't hide from this, but he's considered a right-wing extremist now because he likes
[2:10:58.020 --> 2:11:01.920]  to tell the truth and question official narratives.
[2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:06.760]  And so he does a podcast, he does a rumble show, he has a massive audience obviously
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:11.680]  coming out of Hollywood, rejecting the poison of the New World Order and their lies.
[2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:17.640]  Here he is talking about Bill Gates in one of his recent podcasts in clip nine.
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:22.440]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates, Bill Gates, Bill Gates, Bill Gates, let's see what Bill Gates has
[2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:25.240]  got to say now, the crazy old genius.
[2:11:25.240 --> 2:11:31.120]  Where would you assess where we are today in beating COVID-19?
[2:11:31.120 --> 2:11:32.120]  Don't touch your nose.
[2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:33.640]  We've all seen those videos.
[2:11:33.640 --> 2:11:42.360]  You know, sadly, the virus itself, particularly the variant called Omicron, is the type of
[2:11:42.360 --> 2:11:47.800]  vaccine that is it creates both B-cell and T-cell immunity and it's done a better job
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:52.720]  of getting out to the world population than we have with vaccines.
[2:11:52.720 --> 2:11:54.120]  Why is that sad?
[2:11:54.120 --> 2:11:55.960]  Nature's doing its own vaccines.
[2:11:55.960 --> 2:12:00.240]  Well the problem is if nature does a vaccine, we can't charge you for it.
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:04.720]  So isn't the reason that African nations didn't have access to the vaccine is because
[2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:08.480]  of the refusal of wave patterns that you endorsed, by the way?
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:11.920]  Well I think the mainstream media did a reasonably good job.
[2:12:11.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  What about the CDC?
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:16.520]  Did they do a good job by not publishing the information, by controlling the information,
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:19.800]  by giving us little pipsqueak tidbits bit of information?
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:21.480]  You can handle that bit of information.
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:22.480]  You wouldn't understand it.
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:23.480]  You're too stupid.
[2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:29.760]  The scale of misinformation once you move past the mainstream media is so wild.
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:31.800]  You almost have to laugh about it.
[2:12:31.800 --> 2:12:33.000]  I don't laugh though.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:34.520]  I just don't fund it.
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:37.840]  Are we going to see another pandemic before we are able to beat this one?
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:39.840]  Well we'll have another pandemic.
[2:12:39.840 --> 2:12:40.840]  What time is it?
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:42.320]  There should be another pandemic.
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:45.840]  Do you believe it's possible to prevent the next pandemic?
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:47.080]  Say again?
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:49.680]  Is it possible to prevent the next pandemic?
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:12:52.040]  Yes, every country does what Australia did.
[2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:56.880]  All you're going to do to avoid pandemics, the information of which seems to be controlled
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:13:00.840]  and changes considerably, even in the mainstream media, and some could say especially in the
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:03.600]  mainstream media, where there's been different times where you couldn't talk about the Wuhan
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:07.040]  lab leak, different times where you couldn't talk about vaccine efficacy, different times
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:10.200]  where you couldn't talk about the spread, natural immunity.
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:14.000]  All you got to do is be in prison for the rest of your life.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:15.520]  Is that too much to ask?
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:19.840]  Then you wouldn't be calling it a pandemic, that's all.
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:24.680]  So what's being suggested there is that we all follow the pretty severe efforts that
[2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:25.680]  Australia followed.
[2:13:25.680 --> 2:13:29.600]  Yeah, just be a good slave, just live under tyranny.
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:34.080]  Just enter your prison cell, sit down, shut up and die, and we can avoid the next pandemic.
[2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:35.520]  Thanks Bill Gates.
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:38.960]  Thank you so much.
[2:13:38.960 --> 2:13:47.400]  Now here's, listen to what Klaus Schwab had to say on recently, he's kind of a Bill Gates
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:51.960]  of Europe if you will, just with billions of dollars and a power broker.
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:58.560]  He wants to censor you at the biological level, listen to this in clip 10.
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:09.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies, the future is already here, the future has begun.
[2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:21.920]  It's a new system, it changes us, because it's a fusion of our physical, digital and
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:25.280]  biological spheres.
[2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:28.960]  It's an integration of those spheres.
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:38.280]  Just think of sensors planted into our brains, the opportunities are immense, and we have
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:41.920]  to prepare ourselves already now.
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:45.200]  Just imagine, look what we can do to people digitally.
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:49.160]  We can control their cash, we can shut down their bank accounts, we can shut down their
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:50.520]  free speech.
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:56.360]  Once we become transhumanists, and you become a digital biological android, we can just
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:01.120]  shut you off and shut you up, we don't even have to worry about internet censorship, we're
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:04.080]  just going to literally censor your brain with implantable chips.
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:06.760]  Now do you think Klaus Schwab is going to put himself through that?
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:08.040]  Of course not.
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:11.280]  Do you think Bill Gates is going to become a transhumanist?
[2:15:11.280 --> 2:15:12.440]  Of course not.
[2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:18.320]  They want that for you, the peasants, you, the surf class, you, the slaves, you go into
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:24.480]  transhumanism, bondage, they conquer the planet.
[2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:25.840]  That's the new world order.
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:32.800]  That's the great reset, and there is Klaus Schwab bragging about all of it.
[2:15:32.800 --> 2:15:36.480]  But keep calling it a conspiracy theory.
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:39.960]  Keep pretending like this isn't the world you live in.
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:46.400]  Keep ignoring the future that is becoming more and more clear for everyone to see.
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:51.920]  I don't know about you, but I don't want to be a biological digital android slave.
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:54.320]  Not now, not ever.
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:15:59.160]  So I did it.
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:01.320]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[2:16:01.320 --> 2:16:06.000]  I've been training, probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:14.200]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:19.520]  get going, you know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need,
[2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:24.200]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids
[2:16:24.200 --> 2:16:28.360]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:32.000]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:34.320]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[2:16:34.320 --> 2:16:38.960]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:41.360]  support and extra flexibility.
[2:16:41.360 --> 2:16:45.920]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast, so I can get back to the training.
[2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:50.600]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force, that can
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:54.600]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and sore list can keep
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:16:56.840]  you moving and feeling great at any age.
[2:16:56.840 --> 2:17:01.680]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:03.720]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:09.440]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:10.440]  But we failed.
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:11.880]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[2:17:11.880 --> 2:17:17.680]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[2:17:17.680 --> 2:17:20.040]  deindustrialization great reset.
[2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:24.360]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:28.960]  they know about the show, because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:32.160]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, and
[2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:34.160]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:36.840]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.840]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:45.840]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:47.240]  to ship right now.
[2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:52.400]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up, and before there are long lines and waits.
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:54.680]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:55.680]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[2:17:55.680 --> 2:17:59.680]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were right there, to prevent them
[2:17:59.680 --> 2:18:03.400]  right now, take advantage of this moment, and I have an idea that something everybody
[2:18:03.400 --> 2:18:04.400]  can do.
[2:18:04.400 --> 2:18:09.360]  I think it can be powerful and effective for us to, you know, hang banners over highways.
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:14.360]  Imagine a champagne or a piece of a lame-up, and it says Alex Jones is right, infowarstore.com.
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:17.360]  We stand with the truckers, or rescouts, or whatever it is.
[2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:19.960]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this.
[2:18:19.960 --> 2:18:20.960]  Yes.
[2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:24.440]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:30.240]  wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways, and it will be a chain
[2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:31.240]  reaction.
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:33.120]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:34.440]  I have a few ideas.
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:37.160]  First of all, help just the police to call and inform.
[2:18:37.160 --> 2:18:38.840]  Arrest fouls, arrest while swabbed.
[2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:39.840]  The vaccine is poison.
[2:18:39.840 --> 2:18:40.840]  There's tons of things.
[2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:41.840]  I said, keep it short.
[2:18:41.840 --> 2:18:42.840]  Keep it concise.
[2:18:42.840 --> 2:18:43.840]  No, I agree.
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:45.240]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:46.720]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:47.720]  Beautiful.
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:48.720]  Yeah.
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:50.720]  There's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be effective, so that's
[2:18:50.720 --> 2:18:51.720]  what I'm calling about.
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:18:52.720]  God bless you, Chris.
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:55.960]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[2:18:55.960 --> 2:18:56.960]  Thank you so much.
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:18:59.480]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:00.480]  They're here.
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:03.800]  They're coming from all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:04.800]  to Germany.
[2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:08.600]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:15.080]  and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:19.360]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come
[2:19:19.360 --> 2:19:23.640]  and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:19:23.640 --> 2:19:25.440]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:29.680]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[2:19:29.680 --> 2:19:33.960]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:36.600]  grade at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:36.600 --> 2:19:41.520]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:46.960]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:49.560]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:52.120]  It's all there at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:52.120 --> 2:19:58.920]  So protect your privacy today and support the InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:58.920 --> 2:20:03.360]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:04.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:04.760 --> 2:20:18.800]  When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide, I stop and I turn, I go
[2:20:18.800 --> 2:20:28.880]  back to the bottom, I say okay.
[2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:40.120]  It's worth mentioning here before the show is over that there is a massive freedom convoy
[2:20:40.120 --> 2:20:44.440]  heading to D.C., massive.
[2:20:44.440 --> 2:20:49.160]  Just went through Oklahoma, huge numbers of people on the side of the roads waving flags,
[2:20:49.160 --> 2:20:50.160]  supporting them.
[2:20:50.160 --> 2:20:51.160]  They're going through Missouri.
[2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:59.560]  I mean, there's differing opinions on whether this is a good idea or not, but whatever the
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:01.960]  argument is, it's happening.
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:05.400]  I mean, there is a massive freedom convoy heading to D.C., which is already in martial
[2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:11.600]  law again, because Joe Biden is so popular with his 81 million votes or whatever, 81
[2:21:11.600 --> 2:21:13.320]  trillion votes, you might as well say.
[2:21:13.320 --> 2:21:19.240]  Joe Biden with his 81 trillion votes is so popular that they have to lock down the entire
[2:21:19.240 --> 2:21:24.600]  city of D.C. ahead of his State of the Union, and they have to build massive walls and fences
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:30.200]  around government buildings ahead of his State of the Union, because he's so popular.
[2:21:30.200 --> 2:21:33.720]  It's amazing, isn't it?
[2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:40.200]  This might be one of the greatest moments of political hypocrisy that has ever happened
[2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:43.200]  of all time.
[2:21:43.200 --> 2:21:54.520]  Maria Freeland, the known descendant of Nazis, and the perpetrator of the political imprisonment
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:22:00.920]  and persecution of the Canadian freedom convoy, yes, her, who's punished and destroyed the
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:06.000]  lives of peaceful protesters in Canada.
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:13.040]  You know that she did a march, she led a march for Ukraine, didn't wear a mask.
[2:22:13.040 --> 2:22:21.680]  And she leads a march in Canada for Ukraine after she made it illegal to march and protest
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:22.800]  in Canada.
[2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:24.640]  She goes out and has a march and a protest.
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:28.760]  I mean, that's Nancy Pelosi implementing mass mandates and shutting down businesses in
[2:22:28.760 --> 2:22:38.720]  California, but then bullying small business owners to go give her a hairdo and a haircut.
[2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:42.760]  That's Lori Lightfoot shutting down all the businesses in Chicago and then saying, no,
[2:22:42.760 --> 2:22:45.520]  but I need to get my haircut, I'm more important than you.
[2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:49.840]  That's Gavin Newsom shutting down restaurants in California and then having huge birthday
[2:22:49.840 --> 2:22:53.640]  dinners with all of his friends while he says, you can't go out, you can't go to dinner,
[2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:55.440]  you have to wear a mask.
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:23:02.960]  I mean, these leftist liberals couldn't be more hypocritical if they tried to be.
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:09.040]  How much longer do we have to deal with this, my God?
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:11.920]  How much longer do we have to deal with this scum?
[2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:14.280]  Let's get them off our back, please God.
[2:23:14.280 --> 2:23:16.640]  I'm sorry we killed so many babies with abortion.
[2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:21.160]  I'm sorry we lied and killed so many innocent people with wars.
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:24.000]  Please God forgive us and relieve us of this.
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:27.480]  We just can't take it anymore.
[2:23:27.480 --> 2:23:28.760]  It's just too much.
[2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:30.720]  It's just too much, man.
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:34.920]  And now they're torturing people, they're imprisoning people, they're killing people.
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:40.200]  And so, Christia Freeland says, you can't have a march and then Shego leads a march for
[2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:41.200]  Ukraine.
[2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:46.000]  I mean, I'm so done, man.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:50.240]  I'm so done.
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:52.400]  Just the whole planet is just so done with these people.
[2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:55.480]  In fact, here's a perfect example.
[2:23:55.480 --> 2:24:00.560]  Governor Sisilak of Nevada, and I'll give him credit.
[2:24:00.560 --> 2:24:06.560]  He went out to a restaurant and boy, oh boy, the entire restaurant gave him the what for
[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:15.200]  and the how to, take a look at, but you know, I mean, look, when you're a lying tyrant,
[2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:20.200]  a whole douchebag, yeah, you're not going to get a lot of support in public when the
[2:24:20.200 --> 2:24:22.280]  people find out who you really are.
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:26.280]  That's what happened to Governor Sisilak at a restaurant in Nevada.
[2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:27.280]  Check this out.
[2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:44.600]  I'm surprised that you have the balls to be out here in public, punk, out here without
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:52.040]  a cop, out here without security, woo, you got balls on you, boy, I'm not moving.
[2:24:52.040 --> 2:24:53.040]  Oh man.
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:54.040]  Oh, you in trouble.
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:24:59.040]  Yeah, you better get out of here, Sisilak.
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:01.400]  Where's your security at, punk?
[2:25:01.400 --> 2:25:02.400]  Huh?
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:03.400]  Where's your security at?
[2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:08.320]  You want to sell us all down the river?
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:09.320]  You working for China?
[2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:10.320]  Piece of shit.
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:11.320]  It's called trade.
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:12.320]  You fucking traitors.
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:15.320]  We should string you up by lampposts right now, pussy boy.
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:16.320]  Do you know what they do with the traders?
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:17.320]  They hang them.
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:18.320]  That's right, Patriot.
[2:25:18.320 --> 2:25:19.320]  I think it's awesome.
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:21.320]  You running into a patriot now, huh?
[2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:22.320]  Huh?
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:23.320]  Where's your security at?
[2:25:23.320 --> 2:25:26.400]  I heard about you banging that little girl and wrecking your car, does she know about
[2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:27.400]  that?
[2:25:27.400 --> 2:25:28.400]  Huh, Steve?
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:36.280]  Mr. Sisilak, you treasonous, China-working, sucking mother fucker, where's your security
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:37.280]  at, bitch?
[2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:47.400]  Woo, you lucky I'm a law-abiding citizen, woo, because your daughter's with you, I'm
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:54.720]  going to leave you alone now.
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:55.720]  Patriot.
[2:25:55.720 --> 2:25:56.720]  Yeah.
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:09.720]  Now, this is a bit of a tight rope here, and I'll explain why, but see, you notice most
[2:26:09.720 --> 2:26:13.440]  people weren't even sure who he was, and then when that individual said, hey, look, here's
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:17.280]  the governor, here's the scumbag governor, and then the whole restaurant was like, yeah,
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:18.280]  I hate you.
[2:26:18.280 --> 2:26:19.280]  Yeah, you suck.
[2:26:19.280 --> 2:26:20.280]  Yeah, I hate you.
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:21.280]  Yeah, you destroyed the state.
[2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:24.440]  And then the whole restaurant is like, yeah, what the hell is this guy doing in here?
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:27.240]  Get this scumbag out of here, man, F you.
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:31.760]  And then he runs away like the little coward he is, the little globalist rat that he is.
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:35.160]  I mean, even in the parking lot, people are coming out like, hey, that's the, that's the
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:36.160]  douchebag governor.
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:39.960]  Hey, that's the guy that tried to destroy my life.
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:46.000]  Now here's the tight rope that we face, because we don't live in a free country anymore under
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:47.200]  Joe Biden.
[2:26:47.200 --> 2:26:51.640]  And we have criminals that run our government that will politically persecute you if you
[2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:52.640]  stand against them.
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:27:00.440]  So it's, it's now like this balancing tight rope act where I've done that numerous times
[2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:07.680]  to politicians because, you know, I'll be flying to and from DC and there'll be politicians
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:10.840]  on these flights flying out of DC.
[2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:16.960]  And I'll see, you know, politicians like Al Green and others and I'll put on my camera
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:17.960]  phone.
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:22.840]  I'll come right up to them and I'll say, hey, you know what, you're a liar, you're a scumbag.
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:29.480]  And I didn't, I did that like years ago and I didn't get near the reception from the crowd
[2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:30.480]  around me.
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:35.400]  In fact, they would actually, Al Green one time actually rallied a terroristic crowd
[2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:38.040]  against me to try to do violence against me in an airport.
[2:27:38.040 --> 2:27:43.640]  I mean, literally I had Al Green trying to rally a terroristic attack against me in an
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:47.640]  airport, encouraging a crowd to come up against me.
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:48.640]  Did I back down?
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:49.640]  Of course not.
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:54.520]  But see, now we're at a level where if you even talk to a politician, the Democrats will
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:59.080]  probably try to come after you and arrest you.
[2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:06.080]  That's the level of mafiosa gangster activity that the Democrat party is involved in now
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:07.600]  and big tech and all of them.
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:10.480]  I mean, these are dangerous, dangerous criminals.
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:15.600]  So it's like, how do you properly address and deal with these dangerous criminals that
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:17.720]  are trying to destroy our country?
[2:28:17.720 --> 2:28:26.640]  But then at the same time, keep yourself safe from their gangster mafia political persecution
[2:28:26.640 --> 2:28:31.240]  of you so that you don't get killed or end up in jail the rest of your life, just peacefully
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:34.480]  executing your First Amendment right.
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:39.200]  So that is the difficult tightrope that we are currently on.
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:46.400]  But I've got a feeling that videos like this are only going to become more common, a lot
[2:28:46.400 --> 2:28:47.400]  more common.
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:51.080]  And these politicians are not even going to be able to go out in public very soon.
[2:28:51.080 --> 2:28:53.040]  But they did that to themselves.
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:57.520]  They're the ones that lied to you and destroyed your country.
[2:28:57.520 --> 2:29:04.520]  Two, life changing, life empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out
[2:29:04.520 --> 2:29:08.120]  for months at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:08.120 --> 2:29:11.880]  Winter sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[2:29:11.880 --> 2:29:15.880]  It also has vitamin K, critical fear immune system and so much more.
[2:29:15.880 --> 2:29:19.880]  It's 50% off despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody
[2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:23.120]  needs this old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:24.720]  You need what's in winter sun.
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:33.120]  And then we have Brain Force Ultra, super fast acting, amazing, clean, neutropic system
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:37.440]  that is a compliment to Brain Force Plus and of course, Turbo Force.
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:41.720]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and take
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:44.840]  your focus and clarity and alert us to the next level.
[2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:49.840]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:50.840]  Thank you all for your support.
[2:29:50.840 --> 2:29:54.120]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[2:29:54.120 --> 2:29:55.120]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[2:29:55.120 --> 2:30:05.200]  The Globalist Social Engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:08.400]  until the populations rebelled.
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:13.920]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:30:13.920 --> 2:30:16.880]  anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[2:30:16.880 --> 2:30:22.360]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[2:30:22.360 --> 2:30:28.040]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[2:30:28.040 --> 2:30:34.520]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:35.520]  than ever.
[2:30:35.520 --> 2:30:40.000]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:46.360]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[2:30:46.360 --> 2:30:48.600]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[2:30:48.600 --> 2:30:54.720]  So pray for these folks big time, it's a very serious situation, and stay tuned into infowarstore.com
[2:30:54.720 --> 2:30:57.240]  because truth is absolutely paramount.
[2:30:57.240 --> 2:31:03.200]  It has been noted by many a historian that the first casualty of war is the truth.
[2:31:03.200 --> 2:31:07.880]  And the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[2:31:07.880 --> 2:31:15.720]  No, that invariably follows, but first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty
[2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:18.840]  and speech and massive censorship.
[2:31:18.840 --> 2:31:23.840]  And now across the world, the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:33.160]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[2:31:33.160 --> 2:31:35.160]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[2:31:35.160 --> 2:31:41.840]  And of course now Canada has introduced legislation that if you have a fought crime and they think
[2:31:41.840 --> 2:31:47.360]  you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored and
[2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:48.360]  arrested.
[2:31:48.360 --> 2:31:52.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[2:31:52.480 --> 2:31:57.960]  the world against humanity that makes infowarstore.com more important than ever.
[2:31:57.960 --> 2:32:04.880]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:09.840]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[2:32:09.840 --> 2:32:13.720]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[2:32:13.720 --> 2:32:15.840]  And that's done by design.
[2:32:15.840 --> 2:32:21.880]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[2:32:21.880 --> 2:32:26.760]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[2:32:26.760 --> 2:32:31.880]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:36.520]  Until ten years ago the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[2:32:36.520 --> 2:32:37.520]  exist.
[2:32:37.520 --> 2:32:41.840]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public and its former head, the Schilder steering committee,
[2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:46.200]  is called Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:51.440]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on about
[2:32:51.440 --> 2:32:55.240]  the second-tier worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[2:32:55.240 --> 2:33:19.240]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[2:33:19.240 --> 2:33:36.840]  Well, the mass formation psychosis of the zombie hordes has never been more prevalent.
[2:33:36.840 --> 2:33:43.040]  And while I understand wanting the feel-good approach and the tugging of the heartstrings
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:47.200]  to say, hey, you know what, I don't like to see Russia invading Ukraine, I don't like
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:53.080]  to see war, I don't like to see innocent people dying in this globalist war versus humanity.
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:59.760]  But it's amazing to watch how the brainwashed zombie horde goes from an expert on viruses
[2:33:59.760 --> 2:34:04.760]  to an expert on vaccines to an expert on Ukraine overnight without any research into any of
[2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:08.520]  those subjects for themselves, and of course no debate on the topics either, they just
[2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:10.760]  censor out the opposition.
[2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:14.840]  And so joining me now to discuss this and much more, and host the fourth hour of today's
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:17.440]  transmission is Jake Ducey.
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:18.680]  Jake, it's really incredible.
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:27.200]  I've watched the lowest IQ brainwashed morons in two years become PhD masters in virology
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:32.120]  and vaccines and medicine, and now to geopolitics in Ukraine.
[2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:34.640]  I mean, wow, these people are just geniuses.
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:40.780]  It's like they can just soak up ages and lifetimes of information without actually doing any
[2:34:40.780 --> 2:34:42.280]  research themselves.
[2:34:42.280 --> 2:34:47.320]  Yeah, it's pretty incredible, you know, I think it's something about the replication
[2:34:47.320 --> 2:34:54.000]  of brain cells that some people like us, we seem not to possess the same genetic capabilities.
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:58.460]  You know, there's something to be said about that, and I'm not a big guy that does aliens
[2:34:58.460 --> 2:35:00.920]  or UFOs or the paranormal.
[2:35:00.920 --> 2:35:04.760]  It's stuff that interests me, but I mean, I'm talking to other smart people, rational
[2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:08.840]  people that we talk politics with, and I mean, we're reaching the point of these discussions
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:12.560]  where I mean, we're just like scratching our head like, what is going on here?
[2:35:12.560 --> 2:35:15.200]  This is these are these people even human?
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:17.200]  And we don't want to be a part of dehumanizing somebody.
[2:35:17.200 --> 2:35:20.320]  We don't want to turn into the monsters that the left have turned into.
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:24.760]  But I mean, seriously, it's like, am I watching like, is this an under the skin invasion of
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:26.280]  some weird alien force?
[2:35:26.280 --> 2:35:28.800]  Is this like a they live occupation?
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:32.920]  Because this is this is unrecognizable as human behavior to me.
[2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:39.320]  Well, speaking of under the skin, one of the things that I've been looking into a lot more
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:43.680]  as you know, just helping Alex organize some of his thoughts with this great reset book
[2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:47.360]  and been looking a lot into central bank digital currencies.
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:50.920]  Obviously, we know Klaus Schwab is talking about these inserts that go directly into
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:51.920]  your skin.
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:57.760]  And then I believe it was the Moderna CEO was talking on the World Economic Forum about
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:04.200]  this new type of vaccine, essentially kind of like database system that you swallow this
[2:36:04.200 --> 2:36:08.040]  pill and then it can detect if you've taken it and then they know if you've taken it.
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:11.280]  And as I've been looking more and more into Ukraine, what are the other interesting things
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:18.160]  that I that I found is Makhalo Fedorov, he is Ukraine's minister of digital transformation.
[2:36:18.160 --> 2:36:21.000]  He's on the World Economic Forum's young leaders.
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:24.760]  One of the other things a lot of people don't know, which will be one of the unattended
[2:36:24.760 --> 2:36:30.360]  consequences of all of this is, as you talk about a lot, is this one of the stated great
[2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:36.120]  reset goals is a centralization of everything through central bank digital currency vaccine
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:37.120]  pass.
[2:36:37.120 --> 2:36:40.680]  This is what they're going to use for the bank freezes, what they're doing to Russian
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:41.680]  citizens, right?
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:42.680]  We're not talking about Russian government.
[2:36:42.680 --> 2:36:47.720]  It's just ordinary citizens that now are blocked from Google Pay, Apple Pay, their financial
[2:36:47.720 --> 2:36:48.720]  system.
[2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:49.720]  We see that in Canada.
[2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:54.280]  And here's some interesting quotes from Makhalo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital
[2:36:54.280 --> 2:36:55.280]  transformation.
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:59.200]  He said, quote, we have to make a product that is so convenient that a person will be
[2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:05.040]  able to disrupt their stereotypes, to break free from their fears, and start using government
[2:37:05.040 --> 2:37:06.920]  made applications.
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:10.960]  When we allow a person to register a business in three clicks, when we allow them to pay
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:15.760]  their taxes in two clicks, no matter how skeptical a person is, they will start to use these
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:17.800]  technologies or services.
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:24.520]  The state, what we want to do is have the state in a smart phone, which aims by 2024
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:30.840]  to have 100% of all government services available online with 20% of services provided automatically
[2:37:30.840 --> 2:37:33.840]  without the intervention of the official.
[2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:39.040]  And it's pretty interesting, you know, because that's one thing Ukraine is a leader in, and
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:42.400]  what they're doing to Russia's citizens that have nothing to do with their government,
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:49.160]  freezing their accounts like they did in Canada, the next move here from this organization
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:54.560]  is to move towards the central digital currency that's really not going to be a digital currency,
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:55.560]  right?
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:57.440]  It's going to be the basis of the social credit score system.
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:38:02.200]  And I found it interesting how involved Ukraine is in implementing that.
[2:38:02.200 --> 2:38:07.960]  Well, and look, I want to be clear here, I'm a big supporter of cryptocurrency as a hedge
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:10.560]  against the fiat market.
[2:38:10.560 --> 2:38:16.920]  I mean, I'm a free market, you know, absolutist, I mean, even with NFTs, you think investing
[2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:20.600]  in an NFT like a new form of digital art, like, I'm for all of it.
[2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:28.760]  But see, I have a big beef with the Bitcoin commentary community because they act like
[2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:33.440]  Bitcoin is the be all end all like, oh, you get a broken leg, Bitcoin will solve that.
[2:38:33.440 --> 2:38:36.800]  And they're not just being honest because they put all their life savings in Bitcoin.
[2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:38.040]  And so they want it to succeed.
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:41.520]  So they want you to invest in it so they get richer.
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:42.520]  And they're never honest.
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:45.160]  Look, Bitcoin can go to zero.
[2:38:45.160 --> 2:38:46.160]  That's just a fact.
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:47.320]  I hope that's not the case.
[2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:51.440]  I'd love to see Bitcoin succeed and create generational wealth of people that haven't had
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:52.560]  the experience.
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:54.640]  But see, what does Klaus Schwab say?
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:57.360]  He says, you'll own nothing and you'll have nothing.
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:38:58.720]  Well, what is Bitcoin?
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:38:59.720]  What is an NFT?
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:01.240]  Well, really, it's nothing.
[2:39:01.240 --> 2:39:03.720]  So that's not me speaking negative on these things.
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:04.720]  I want them to succeed.
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:07.040]  It's a way of people taking the power back.
[2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:09.940]  But at the same time, I can see how it can be manipulated.
[2:39:09.940 --> 2:39:16.040]  And just like we had a great stock market crash in the 20s, or in the 20th century,
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:18.440]  we could have a big cryptocurrency crash.
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:19.720]  Notice how they're promoting all of it.
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:22.440]  They want everybody to invest in it now and, oh, look at the returns.
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:23.840]  Well, what if it goes to zero?
[2:39:23.840 --> 2:39:25.640]  That'll be the next big crash.
[2:39:25.640 --> 2:39:28.840]  So here's the point.
[2:39:28.840 --> 2:39:30.880]  Anything digital can be controlled.
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:36.600]  And like you said, in Russia, just average citizens can't use their digital payment anymore.
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:39.000]  In Canada, they're shutting down your bank account.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  Well, OK.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:44.480]  Of course, the World Economic Forum wants a cashless society because then they totally
[2:39:44.480 --> 2:39:48.520]  control you and they control the flow of money.
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:54.040]  And so if all of your currency is digital and doesn't have any either hard value or
[2:39:54.040 --> 2:39:58.000]  a hard asset you can keep in your hand, you're a slave.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.720]  And that's what if people looked at what's going on in Russia, they might understand
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:02.720]  this better.
[2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:06.920]  Well, it's going to be interesting to see there's more and more talks about the cyber
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:08.000]  attacks, right, too.
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.760]  We saw our best friend, Hillary Clinton, go on and say, we need to attack them with
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:14.400]  a cyber war.
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:21.400]  And the cyber pandemic, obviously, that Klaus Schwab talked about when he said, 99% worse
[2:40:21.400 --> 2:40:24.520]  is the cyber pandemic, forget COVID.
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:30.480]  And that's how they're going to need an emergency to usher people in mass.
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:35.200]  And of course, they're going to be able to get a percentage of these very high IQ people
[2:40:35.200 --> 2:40:39.200]  that are just going to accept some of their UBI, which is really not going to be money.
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:42.040]  It's going to be a credit system that they're going to get access to.
[2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:46.320]  But how do they get the rest of it onto the rest of us onto this system?
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:50.160]  And that's what I wonder, the cyber pandemic and these types of things seem to make a lot
[2:40:50.160 --> 2:40:51.160]  of sense.
[2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:58.440]  And now in one respect, one of the unintended, intentional or unintended, unintentional consequences
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:02.200]  of this Russia thing is now the conversation about cyber attacks.
[2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:07.680]  I was talking to a big CEO for a very big publicly traded company in Canada, and the
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:11.440]  Canadian government sent a press release out to all these big corporations and let them
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:18.360]  know, hey, prepare for some type of potential consequences to the financial system, cyber
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:20.760]  attacks on the financial system.
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:24.040]  And maybe that's how they officially get us to own nothing.
[2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:29.360]  And then this is how they usher in the official new system of the great reset.
[2:41:29.360 --> 2:41:30.360]  I don't know.
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:35.400]  Well, either way, the digital currency is a huge problem.
[2:41:35.400 --> 2:41:41.720]  A cashless society is a huge problem because it limits the individuals, you know, just
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:45.880]  peer to peer, real human peer to peer exchanging of currencies.
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:51.680]  If it's all digital, you're reliant on a third party to allow you access to that.
[2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:55.520]  And that's a dangerous concept that people are learning, unfortunately, the hard way
[2:41:55.520 --> 2:41:56.840]  right now in Russia.
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:01.960]  I mean, Russia and Canada, I mean, you've got the lines in Russia building up because
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:04.520]  people can't access Apple or Google Pay.
[2:42:04.520 --> 2:42:09.640]  Oh, yeah, Apple and Google, Jake, those are two companies that we should trust.
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:14.480]  Apple and Google are just extremely high as far as the moral ethics are concerned.
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:20.360]  Yeah, it really is amazing to watch and what a lot of individuals have stated is it's called
[2:42:20.360 --> 2:42:25.680]  the digital do gulag, right, for for this 21st century fascistic takeover.
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:28.440]  It's a digital do it's a digital gulag.
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:33.520]  And once this thing is in place, which it's just so interesting to see the tie ins to Ukraine
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:38.800]  in they want to be the leader in moving everything digital from your taxes to your bank accounts
[2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:40.000]  to everything.
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:42.160]  That's the digital gulag, I guess.
[2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:45.240]  All right, Jake Ducey is with us for another segment.
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:49.160]  And then he hosts the entire fourth hour.
[2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:52.600]  And we'll talk about some of the stuff Jake is doing here with info wars.
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:42:53.920]  It's really great work.
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:42:57.560]  And we'll highlight some of the other news and he'll tell you what's coming up.
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:43:00.480]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:06.200]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting
[2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:10.600]  people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[2:43:10.600 --> 2:43:15.520]  And if you're not getting sunshine every single day, whether you're black or white or Hispanic,
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:20.480]  it doesn't matter, your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:21.480]  are out there.
[2:43:21.480 --> 2:43:25.560]  It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen, you die in five
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:28.520]  or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:33.600]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[2:43:33.600 --> 2:43:34.600]  you need.
[2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:38.760]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin D3.
[2:43:38.760 --> 2:43:43.840]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's
[2:43:43.840 --> 2:43:50.280]  offenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[2:43:50.280 --> 2:43:53.320]  Everybody old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3.
[2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:59.360]  This is the best quality out there and it funds the info war 50% off.
[2:43:59.360 --> 2:44:10.200]  William of California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[2:44:10.200 --> 2:44:11.200]  I agree.
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:12.720]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:13.720]  Hi, Alex.
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:14.720]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:16.720]  Can I plug, uh, Alex real quick?
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:17.720]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:22.880]  Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them
[2:44:22.880 --> 2:44:27.520]  into the ground and you wanted to know why and I tested this and I've taken your B12
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:30.440]  and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[2:44:30.440 --> 2:44:31.440]  I really do.
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:34.520]  I take that B12 and I am electric, man.
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:35.760]  I can run 10 miles.
[2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:40.800]  I did some pretty heavy work, uh, with a highway department and my friends will attest to the
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:46.160]  fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70, I'm, and I'm no, I'm
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:47.800]  not just blowing smoke here.
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:57.520]  The B12 saves my life.
[2:44:57.520 --> 2:44:58.520]  Mike in California.
[2:44:58.520 --> 2:44:59.520]  Thanks for calling.
[2:44:59.520 --> 2:45:02.880]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[2:45:02.880 --> 2:45:08.240]  Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:13.680]  in deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research
[2:45:13.680 --> 2:45:19.040]  involving influenza, MERS and SARS virus does nothing about SARS like viruses and it's
[2:45:19.040 --> 2:45:20.200]  a research funding pause.
[2:45:20.200 --> 2:45:21.360]  It's not a stop.
[2:45:21.360 --> 2:45:22.360]  It's not a prohibition.
[2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:25.480]  It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stop sign.
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:28.080]  You stop, you look both ways and then you proceed.
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:32.600]  And so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function,
[2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:36.840]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:39.960]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[2:45:39.960 --> 2:45:42.720]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function.
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:44.560]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:47.920]  That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic
[2:45:47.920 --> 2:45:50.280]  life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[2:45:50.280 --> 2:45:53.360]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[2:45:53.360 --> 2:45:56.000]  You're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  Thank you, Mike.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  We love you.
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  Sold out for months.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:01.760]  X3 is now back in stock.
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:05.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:09.200]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[2:46:09.200 --> 2:46:11.200]  It's not the soil anymore.
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:13.160]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:18.520]  But when you get high quality tri iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it
[2:46:18.520 --> 2:46:23.120]  does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune
[2:46:23.120 --> 2:46:24.120]  system.
[2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:30.120]  So, X3, the only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:33.800]  again at 50% off at infowarestore.com.
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:37.640]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:42.000]  two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.800]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:48.880]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:49.880]  what does for your body.
[2:46:49.880 --> 2:46:54.560]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[2:46:54.560 --> 2:46:59.200]  So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:11.560]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:13.560]  Jake Ducey is with us here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:18.400]  This is the final segment for Mio and Shroyer before I come back and host the War Room,
[2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:23.240]  which I'm telling you, this is going to be one of the most important War Room transmissions
[2:47:23.240 --> 2:47:27.120]  I've ever done coming up at three o'clock.
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:28.120]  So get ready for that.
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:29.320]  So Jake Ducey with us here.
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:35.560]  Now Jake really was essential in what a lot of people are considering the next level of
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:41.800]  Alex Jones with all the stuff that he's done here at Infowars and that's resetwars.com.
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:45.160]  And so Jake, I don't know if you can talk about some of the new projects that you're
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:46.160]  getting into right now.
[2:47:46.160 --> 2:47:48.320]  I don't know if you're going to talk about that in the next segment.
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:51.600]  So I'll just leave it right there because I'm not really sure what you want to get into
[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:53.120]  or not as far as that's concerned.
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:56.000]  But you know, the point is this.
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:58.320]  I get into all this information here.
[2:47:58.320 --> 2:48:04.840]  I get into all the news all day and I just bury myself in it and we tend to disconnect
[2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:11.080]  ourselves with the spiritual aspect of things, the psychological aspect of things, which is
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:16.200]  really just as important as all of this news I have on my desk, maybe even more important.
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:22.880]  Quite frankly, this is just kind of a gateway to channeling the soul and the spirit that
[2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:26.720]  has been dormant because of the chemicals and the food and water and the programming
[2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:27.720]  on the TV.
[2:48:27.720 --> 2:48:32.000]  And so I guess getting back to what we were talking about in the last segment, it's like,
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:35.200]  how do you de-program someone that's become an NPC?
[2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:40.600]  How do you de-program somebody that's become a brainwashed zombie that thinks they're a
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:46.000]  virus expert, a vaccine expert, and a Ukraine expert simply because that's what the mass
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:50.960]  programming is brainwashing them into thinking?
[2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:57.360]  Yeah, so first of all, thanks, Owen, and I want to say to everyone, Alex's got a lot
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:48:58.560]  of awesome things coming up.
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:02.720]  He's got a major book that's going to be coming out before the midterms and Alex's
[2:49:02.720 --> 2:49:05.960]  brain is like 40 encyclopedias.
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:12.200]  So I'm just kind of helping him piece together, you know, Alex could write a thousand books
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:15.040]  each a thousand pages long, but simplifying it, right?
[2:49:15.040 --> 2:49:19.000]  So I've been out there working with him on that, that's coming out real soon, a lot of
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  other awesome stuff.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:24.480]  And while we were out there, he said, let's do with all of this crazy stuff going on,
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:27.040]  the most important thing is to control what you can control.
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:28.640]  So he asked me to come on.
[2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:35.080]  We're going to do a 50% special that's beginning right now for 48 hours, resetwars.com.
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:40.160]  This is Alex's first ever online course that breaks down exactly how to prepare for the
[2:49:40.160 --> 2:49:41.160]  great reset, right?
[2:49:41.160 --> 2:49:45.920]  This is a, it's a war of innumerous respects, it's a financial war, it's a psychological
[2:49:45.920 --> 2:49:49.920]  war, it's a geopolitical war, it's a mental war, it's a spiritual war.
[2:49:49.920 --> 2:49:54.300]  And resetwars helps you break down how to navigate that exactly.
[2:49:54.300 --> 2:49:59.520]  So we don't just get bogged down and consumed by all of this information, but that we can
[2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:02.760]  actually do something about it to protect ourselves, to protect our friends, to protect
[2:50:02.760 --> 2:50:03.760]  our family.
[2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:07.400]  We've had massive censorship and blocks that we've talked about many times.
[2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:09.320]  This is some very important information.
[2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:10.320]  It's resetwars.com.
[2:50:10.320 --> 2:50:15.280]  If you haven't got it yet, it's 50% offer, very limited time, so you go to resetwars.com.
[2:50:15.280 --> 2:50:18.480]  I'm going to be talking about 10 other ways to prepare yourself for everything that's
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:24.240]  happening, but Owen, to answer your question, so we're just kind of preparing stuff for
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:25.240]  the book.
[2:50:25.240 --> 2:50:29.040]  And towards the end of the book, you know, I said to Alex, one of the ways that your
[2:50:29.040 --> 2:50:34.280]  information changed my life is because once I learned all of this stuff, what happened
[2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:39.640]  to me is I said, well, if all of reality is this, you know, bizarre matrix illusion that
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:43.600]  we're living in, I'm actually going to go out, I'm going to learn all this information
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:48.400]  about consciousness, mind control, the nature of reality, I'm going to use it to actually
[2:50:48.400 --> 2:50:51.120]  create my dream life for myself.
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:55.600]  And Alex said, you know, as we wrap up the book, one of the most important things is
[2:50:55.600 --> 2:51:00.160]  a lot of times people learn all this information, but then what happens is they get filled with
[2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:04.200]  hatred, they get filled with anger, they do what they want you to do, which is to lock
[2:51:04.200 --> 2:51:06.720]  yourself in your room, get ready for your pod.
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:11.320]  Pretty soon they'll feed you the crickets and we sit in our room and we get totally disconnected
[2:51:11.320 --> 2:51:14.640]  and the negative energy actually ends up eating us up.
[2:51:14.640 --> 2:51:18.760]  And Alex talks about in Reset Wars, the transmutation of energy.
[2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:21.640]  Energy's never created or destroyed, emotions are just energy.
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:25.320]  So the transmutation of energy is something Napoleon Hill talks about in his book, Think
[2:51:25.320 --> 2:51:29.680]  and Grow Rich, that dissatisfaction is a creative state.
[2:51:29.680 --> 2:51:33.360]  So the most important thing we can do right now is to control what we control, take this
[2:51:33.360 --> 2:51:37.520]  anger, take this confusion, all these messed up emotions, and then how can we turn this
[2:51:37.520 --> 2:51:42.560]  into a creative state to protect our friends, our family, improve our businesses, our mind,
[2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:44.760]  our spirituality, whatever it might be.
[2:51:44.760 --> 2:51:48.680]  That's what Reset Wars is about and that's really how Alex and I started working together
[2:51:48.680 --> 2:51:52.360]  here and there is because I just said, hey, you know, this is how your work's improved
[2:51:52.360 --> 2:51:53.360]  it.
[2:51:53.360 --> 2:51:54.360]  And he said, this is what we need.
[2:51:54.360 --> 2:51:56.280]  I'm covering the news all the time now.
[2:51:56.280 --> 2:52:02.240]  We also have to give people practical ways to prepare themselves and that's, there's
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:05.160]  a whole catalog of things we're going to be rolling out.
[2:52:05.160 --> 2:52:10.600]  First is Reset Wars, the book, all that, resetwars.com is 50% special and that's kind of the conversation
[2:52:10.600 --> 2:52:13.160]  we were having yesterday, Owen.
[2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:20.120]  Well, and you think about, you know, it's a cliche, like the best revenge is living a
[2:52:20.120 --> 2:52:22.440]  happy, healthy, successful life, right?
[2:52:22.440 --> 2:52:27.760]  And it's a tough thing to apply when you're dealing with the New World Order knowing the
[2:52:27.760 --> 2:52:31.000]  future they have in store, but yet it still exists there.
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:38.560]  And so I think if the analogy of Info Wars being the sunglasses in They Live that kind
[2:52:38.560 --> 2:52:42.600]  of break down the matrix, break through all the propaganda you put on the Info Wars glasses.
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:49.000]  It's almost as if, you know, our media coverage at Info Wars is one lens, but it's not the
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:54.400]  complete vision until you awaken the spiritual side of things too.
[2:52:54.400 --> 2:52:58.640]  The spiritual side, the mental side, and then think about how many people Alex talks about
[2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:02.440]  in the Reset Wars course don't become a victim to the New World Order.
[2:53:02.440 --> 2:53:06.200]  Think about how many people know all this information, but they're so consumed to it
[2:53:06.200 --> 2:53:11.040]  in a point where they become so pessimistic about life that they no longer have any creative
[2:53:11.040 --> 2:53:16.840]  ideas to improve their business, to improve their community, awesome political ideas to
[2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:19.960]  run local ways to rebuild the education system.
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:24.080]  They want to keep us in the lower planes of the psychological warfare, so we stay in a
[2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:26.960]  reactionary animalistic state of consciousness.
[2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:29.520]  And we have to move to a creative force, right?
[2:53:29.520 --> 2:53:34.200]  And this is building the new networks, the new internets, the new businesses, using this
[2:53:34.200 --> 2:53:41.320]  type of energy, of urgency or anger, whatever you feel, transmuting that energy into creative
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:45.520]  force to double the sales in your real estate business, to grow an extra private practice
[2:53:45.520 --> 2:53:51.800]  in your local medical or doctor practice, so that we can deliver people honest medicine.
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:54.240]  Whatever it is for you, this is how we do it.
[2:53:54.240 --> 2:54:00.880]  But they want to keep us in such a frenetic, stagnant state that by default we enslave ourselves
[2:54:00.880 --> 2:54:04.680]  because we're aware, but we aren't doing anything with any of the knowledge.
[2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:08.560]  And I think that's what Alex always talks about, is knowledge is power, right?
[2:54:08.560 --> 2:54:12.560]  And this is the next step, is transmuting this energy into creative forces.
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:16.120]  And if you look at anyone who's ever influenced the world in a positive way, what did they
[2:54:16.120 --> 2:54:17.120]  do?
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:18.840]  They were dissatisfied with something.
[2:54:18.840 --> 2:54:22.880]  And then they used their creative energy to propose a new solution to it.
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:27.320]  I mean, whether it's flying, airplanes, whatever it is, but then the next question is, how
[2:54:27.320 --> 2:54:28.320]  can I do that?
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:29.320]  How can you do that?
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:30.320]  Oh, and you did that.
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:33.320]  There are tons of other people that know all this information, and they want to be like,
[2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:35.760]  oh, and they want to be like Alex, and they want to do media.
[2:54:35.760 --> 2:54:37.240]  You did something with it.
[2:54:37.240 --> 2:54:39.280]  And all of us have to start doing this.
[2:54:39.280 --> 2:54:44.440]  And that's the old Buckminster Fuller quote, is don't fight the old system, build a new
[2:54:44.440 --> 2:54:46.040]  one that makes the old one obsolete.
[2:54:46.040 --> 2:54:50.920]  And every single person, I believe God's given them a special unique talent, gift, and interest.
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:54.520]  And how can we materialize that for the limited time that we're here?
[2:54:54.520 --> 2:54:55.520]  That's how we do something.
[2:54:55.520 --> 2:54:58.200]  That's how we wake other people up, too, in my opinion.
[2:54:58.200 --> 2:55:03.680]  I love that you just said that, because one of my, I don't know if you'd call it a pet
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:09.600]  peeve, but it's just like this little click in my head that is always there.
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:12.560]  And I think it just has to do with, and a lot of people are the same way.
[2:55:12.560 --> 2:55:18.760]  It's why people watch sporting events, or the Super Bowl, or people deliver great speeches.
[2:55:18.760 --> 2:55:25.520]  I like observing, and witnessing, and appreciating, and experiencing other people that have mastered
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:26.520]  their craft.
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:30.720]  There are other people that are truly great, and uplift humanity.
[2:55:30.720 --> 2:55:37.000]  And I have this weird pet peeve, where if I see somebody that has huge potential that
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:41.280]  is just going to waste, and just being spoiled, and they're not tapping into that, that like,
[2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:42.280]  that hurts me.
[2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:45.440]  Like, I'm like, I'm like screaming, like, hey, you're amazing.
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:47.000]  You can do so much more.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  Don't you know that?
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  You just need a little encouragement.
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:50.520]  You just need a little focus.
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:53.080]  And I see with the youth of the nation, it's the same thing.
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:58.800]  Like, the school system wants them downtrodden, the public school education keeps them downtrodden,
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:01.080]  the college indoctrination keeps them downtrodding.
[2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:05.160]  It's like, no, you do have something special for you in this universe.
[2:56:05.160 --> 2:56:07.000]  You do have a divine destiny.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:11.320]  You have to understand that, believe it, and tap into it, and reach your full potential.
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:13.120]  Watching wasted potential crushes me.
[2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:17.880]  Now you look at the World Economic Forum and the Great Reset, they want all of human potential
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:18.880]  wasted.
[2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:20.320]  They want all this human potential squandered.
[2:56:20.320 --> 2:56:21.440]  I want to tap into it.
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:25.640]  I want it to become the number one resource on this planet as humans.
[2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:28.120]  Yeah, there's this cool quote.
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:34.440]  It says that instead of education or entertainment, they blend the two together, edutainment, where
[2:56:34.440 --> 2:56:38.760]  we learn all this information and we get awake, but it becomes entertainment.
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:42.720]  We get the serotonin and the dopamine releases of everything, but we're not doing anything
[2:56:42.720 --> 2:56:44.120]  with the information.
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:49.400]  And what we need is everything from people that are going to become the number one real
[2:56:49.400 --> 2:56:52.680]  estate agent in their area, and they're going to be super awake, and they're going to have
[2:56:52.680 --> 2:56:57.680]  extra money to start building new things, same in medical, same in movies, same in shows.
[2:56:57.680 --> 2:57:01.680]  Across the board, it's this type of movement that has to occur.
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:05.280]  And that's kind of what I just proposed to Alex, and he said, well, let's build this
[2:57:05.280 --> 2:57:06.520]  whole new catalog.
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:07.520]  That's Reset Wars.
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:10.520]  That's the next book coming out, the expose of the Great Reset.
[2:57:10.520 --> 2:57:14.200]  All of these types of things, that's the next step that has to happen, right?
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:18.880]  If we actually believe we're made in the image of God, then we all have a divine destiny here,
[2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:22.120]  and it's not just to look at all this bad stuff.
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:25.360]  It's for us to literally start to change the world and build a new one.
[2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:26.520]  No, that's it, exactly.
[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:29.800]  The lie of the Great Reset, the lie of the New World Order, which is really going to
[2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:33.600]  be rolled out when they talk about manmade climate change, is that you're a virus, you're
[2:57:33.600 --> 2:57:34.760]  a parasite on this planet.
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:35.760]  You need to die.
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:40.560]  No, you are a divine creation of God's meant to live and thrive.
[2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:44.360]  Jake Ducey, hosting the fourth hour, I'll be back hosting the War Room.
[2:57:44.360 --> 2:57:54.040]  Two, life-changing, life-empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out
[2:57:54.040 --> 2:57:57.600]  for months at infowarstore.com.
[2:57:57.600 --> 2:58:01.760]  Winter Sun is the highest quality, organic vitamin D3, taken under the tongue, it also
[2:58:01.760 --> 2:58:05.400]  has vitamin T, critical fear immune system and so much more.
[2:58:05.400 --> 2:58:09.400]  It's 50% off, despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly, because everybody
[2:58:09.400 --> 2:58:12.640]  needs this old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:18.800]  You need what's in Winter Sun and then we have Brain Force Ultra, super fast acting,
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:25.720]  amazing, clean, neutropic system that is a compliment to Brain Force Plus and of course
[2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:26.960]  Turbo Force.
[2:58:26.960 --> 2:58:31.240]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and take
[2:58:31.240 --> 2:58:34.360]  your focus and clarity and alert us to the next level.
[2:58:34.360 --> 2:58:39.360]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:40.360]  Thank you all for your support.
[2:58:40.360 --> 2:58:43.640]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[2:58:43.640 --> 2:58:46.640]  infowarstore.com.
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:53.240]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth and the
[2:58:53.240 --> 2:59:00.440]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die, no that invariably follows, but first
[2:59:00.440 --> 2:59:08.080]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[2:59:08.080 --> 2:59:13.880]  and now across the world, the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:22.560]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[2:59:22.560 --> 2:59:27.960]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned and of course now Canada is under this legislation
[2:59:27.960 --> 2:59:34.280]  that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate
[2:59:34.280 --> 2:59:38.120]  speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[2:59:38.120 --> 2:59:41.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[2:59:41.960 --> 2:59:50.160]  the world against humanity that makes infowarstore.com more important than ever.
[2:59:50.160 --> 3:00:05.960]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:05.960 --> 3:00:12.280]  Welcome back to the Al Cio Cio, this is Jake Ducey here in honor of the fourth hour and
[3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:16.120]  today I have 10 things that I want to talk about, 10 ways to prepare yourself for the
[3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:19.320]  great reset and everything that's happening now, these are just 10 things that I've been
[3:00:19.320 --> 3:00:23.440]  doing, 10 things that I've been working on and so whatever lands for you, you can keep
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:27.560]  whatever doesn't, doesn't, but we're going to talk about practical ways that you can
[3:00:27.560 --> 3:00:32.480]  prepare yourself and I'm here in honor of Alex is doing a 50% off on reset wars.
[3:00:32.480 --> 3:00:36.160]  If you had to resetwars.com, it's 50% off now.
[3:00:36.160 --> 3:00:39.840]  The reason this is so important is because the whole way this works like Oh and I were
[3:00:39.840 --> 3:00:44.440]  talking about is the goal is to keep us as downtrodden as humanly possible and they do
[3:00:44.440 --> 3:00:49.960]  this by making us feel so disconnected and so disempowered from everything that's happening
[3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:53.800]  that they're in control of it, that even the people that are awake aren't doing anything
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:00:59.000]  about it, aren't offering, aren't creating solutions and so what happens is they keep
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:03.720]  us trapped in the mental and emotional planes of this warfare or this, this psychological
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:08.760]  control system and that's resetwars.com which is the first of many things Alex is creating
[3:01:08.760 --> 3:01:09.760]  and rolling out.
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:14.520]  They're going to be step by step actionable guides to combat and prepare yourself for
[3:01:14.520 --> 3:01:15.520]  the great reset.
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:20.400]  So it's resetwars.com 50% off now before I get into some of these 10 ways to prepare
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:25.360]  yourself, just wanted to play a quick clip of one of the testimonies so you know some
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:30.480]  of the amazing results and some of the amazing positive results that people are getting from
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:31.480]  reset wars.
[3:01:31.480 --> 3:01:34.880]  We're going to have one of those players if you're like me, you've been a long time
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:39.760]  listener of this program, you've fed up with everything going on in the world, inside you
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:46.000]  like me, a fire is burning, something needs to change and yet we feel helpless, almost
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:49.560]  like we're stuck inside a system that someone else created for us.
[3:01:49.560 --> 3:01:52.480]  It's time for us to break free from that system.
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:54.760]  Reset wars is a game changer.
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:59.880]  You start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim.
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:05.240]  So much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration, low energy and makes us depressed
[3:02:05.240 --> 3:02:08.000]  and therefore we manifest this negative reality out there.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:12.280]  When they feel they're lied to each steel plant to enslave and rob the people, there
[3:02:12.280 --> 3:02:13.640]  is an awakening.
[3:02:13.640 --> 3:02:21.000]  Reset wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint and lock onto the deep rooted psychological
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:24.680]  tactics that were being used against me and now I'm not scared anymore.
[3:02:24.680 --> 3:02:27.080]  I have to say I was blown away.
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:30.280]  I feel so much better every day listening to it.
[3:02:30.280 --> 3:02:34.560]  To Alex, thank you very much for putting the course together, you're absolutely right.
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:40.400]  We are reflections of God, we are emanations of that and we can use that God energy to
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:43.080]  do really anything we want to do in this life.
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:47.640]  Romans chapter 12, Paul talks about how we're transformed by the renewing of our mind and
[3:02:47.640 --> 3:02:48.800]  that's a process.
[3:02:48.800 --> 3:02:51.920]  Most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious.
[3:02:51.920 --> 3:02:54.280]  Most people go through their day and don't think about many things.
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:57.880]  You can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip.
[3:02:57.880 --> 3:03:03.600]  In this process, we need to have a concerted, active effort physically and mentally to reprogram
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:05.320]  that subconscious mind.
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:09.840]  That's what this series is about, is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:10.840]  mind.
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:15.840]  He's exactly right and he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:21.240]  awakening and I encourage everybody out there, if you haven't gone there yet, go to resetwars.com.
[3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:31.640]  That's where your journey begins.
[3:03:31.640 --> 3:03:34.200]  So I just wanted to play that just so you have an idea.
[3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:38.400]  You look, this isn't just another thing that we put out with resetwars.
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:44.360]  This is so important for the great reset because the whole goal is about keeping us disempowered
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:48.040]  as you saw from some of those stories there.
[3:03:48.040 --> 3:03:53.000]  People are realizing all of us have a role and a place to play in this and so as I start
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.400]  moving through 10 ways, prepare yourself.
[3:03:55.400 --> 3:03:59.880]  One of them is don't get distracted, control what you can control.
[3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:05.680]  The whole goal of psychological warfare or information warfare is to send such a bombardment
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:11.560]  on our senses that we get so focused on the exterior world that what happens is all of
[3:04:11.560 --> 3:04:15.520]  our energy sucked out like a vampire into things in the outside world that we can't
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:20.680]  control, which is how we don't create solutions and which is how we create our own enslavement.
[3:04:20.680 --> 3:04:21.680]  They aren't doing it.
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:23.240]  We're creating it on our own.
[3:04:23.240 --> 3:04:27.000]  And as someone proposed in there, they realize they do have a role to play.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:31.040]  There's that old quote from the Bible that talks about do not be conformed by the world,
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:33.600]  be transformed by the renewing of your own mind.
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:38.280]  And so the question is, how can you take this energy, this hatred, what this confusion,
[3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:42.400]  this frustration and how can you use it to offer and create a solution for yourself or
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:48.120]  your friends, for your family, for your business right now, resetformers.com for a very limited
[3:04:48.120 --> 3:04:49.120]  time.

[3:06:02.240 --> 3:06:03.640]  Welcome back to the Alex Shoncho.
[3:06:03.640 --> 3:06:08.640]  This is Jake Ducey and I want to move through Tim's ways that I'm personally preparing myself
[3:06:08.640 --> 3:06:11.720]  for the great reset and many of the things involved in that.
[3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:16.960]  Right before we went to the break, we were talking about not getting distracted and controlling
[3:06:16.960 --> 3:06:19.080]  what you can control.
[3:06:19.080 --> 3:06:25.600]  And number two is to turn your anger, your frustration, your confusion into creative
[3:06:25.600 --> 3:06:26.600]  energy.
[3:06:26.600 --> 3:06:31.320]  In Napoleon Hill's book, Thinking Grow Rich, he talks about how dissatisfaction is a creative
[3:06:31.320 --> 3:06:32.320]  state.
[3:06:32.320 --> 3:06:34.120]  How did Alex create infowars?
[3:06:34.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  What happened?
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:38.360]  Well, he was this kid that realized the world wasn't what he thought it was.
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:42.320]  He was dissatisfied with it and he was concerned about where it was going.
[3:06:42.320 --> 3:06:47.680]  He used that energy, that anger, that frustration as a creative state to build one of the biggest
[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:51.680]  media enterprises and movements in the world.
[3:06:51.680 --> 3:06:52.680]  Right?
[3:06:52.680 --> 3:06:53.680]  And we start going down the list.
[3:06:53.680 --> 3:06:58.080]  And one of the ways that my life changed from this information is once I realized it all,
[3:06:58.080 --> 3:07:01.320]  then I started to say, well, what's my place in it?
[3:07:01.320 --> 3:07:05.800]  And there was a time when all of it made me so depressed and so angry and so negative,
[3:07:05.800 --> 3:07:09.840]  I just sat there angry, depressed and negative, refreshed all the bad news over and over
[3:07:09.840 --> 3:07:11.160]  and over again.
[3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:16.200]  And there's a point at which that energy, if we aren't utilizing it, we actually create
[3:07:16.200 --> 3:07:18.200]  our own mental gulag.
[3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:20.880]  Earlier with Owen, we talked about the digital gulag, right?
[3:07:20.880 --> 3:07:25.560]  This centralized controlled digital system that Alex and many people on infowars have
[3:07:25.560 --> 3:07:27.320]  talked at great lengths about.
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:29.960]  But what about the mental, spiritual, and psychological gulag?
[3:07:29.960 --> 3:07:34.040]  Look at that graphic right there, you can see a perfect example of it, the mental plane
[3:07:34.040 --> 3:07:35.040]  gets locked.
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:38.520]  And a lot of times we like to think of other people as the zombies and we like to think
[3:07:38.520 --> 3:07:42.400]  of other people as the brainwashed fools.
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:46.840]  But in a lot of ways, we become our own zombies, we become our own mental, psychological, and
[3:07:46.840 --> 3:07:48.640]  spiritual gulag.
[3:07:48.640 --> 3:07:54.880]  And what happens is we vibrate at such a low emotional frequency of anger and pessimism
[3:07:54.880 --> 3:08:01.360]  that what happens is being awake actually becomes a destructive force for us.
[3:08:01.360 --> 3:08:07.000]  So Napoleon Hill talks about how dissatisfaction is a creative state and that you can use dissatisfaction
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  to grow your business.
[3:08:08.000 --> 3:08:11.160]  I mean, think about what you could do if you could double or triple your income.
[3:08:11.160 --> 3:08:14.320]  Think about what you could do for your friends, for your family, for your community.
[3:08:14.320 --> 3:08:17.800]  Think about what movements you could find if you could double or triple your business,
[3:08:17.800 --> 3:08:18.800]  whatever it was.
[3:08:18.800 --> 3:08:21.640]  Whether you were in sales, whether you were in real estate, whether you did something
[3:08:21.640 --> 3:08:26.480]  online, whether you had a media company, make that a goal.
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:29.640]  Turn this energy into a creative state, right?
[3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:33.240]  The same thing can be so for our health, for our investing, for our career.
[3:08:33.240 --> 3:08:36.000]  It's about the transmutation of energy and reset wars.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:40.800]  Alex breaks down some of the universal laws later in the course, as he's moving through
[3:08:40.800 --> 3:08:43.360]  how to protect yourself from the great reset.
[3:08:43.360 --> 3:08:48.440]  And one of the universal laws that he talks about is the transmutation of energy.
[3:08:48.440 --> 3:08:52.720]  This tells us that energy is never created or destroyed in all emotions, our energy.
[3:08:52.720 --> 3:08:58.960]  So when we transmute energy and we use that energy as inspiration and we use that energy
[3:08:58.960 --> 3:09:04.280]  as creative fuel, that's when we start to move out of the psychological, mental and
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:08.160]  spiritual gulag that I believe we've created on ourself.
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:12.160]  It's easy to say they've done this tyranny, they've controlled us, but in some ways we've
[3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:14.280]  unconsciously done it on ourselves.
[3:09:14.280 --> 3:09:21.720]  But if we give them all the power, we also give them the keys to our own destiny as well.
[3:09:21.720 --> 3:09:28.920]  And I want to talk about not letting that negative energy store in us as a loss, even
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:30.120]  though we're awake.
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:34.000]  And Alex was saying, one of the most frustrating, as we're organizing some of the stuff for
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:38.080]  his new book, he was saying, one of the most frustrating things about all this information
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:44.200]  is some people will learn all this information on the show, but then what happens is all
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:51.200]  that anger, hatred, confusion, it fessers in them and stores in them.
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:57.080]  And then in essence, all they end up doing is basically nothing.
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:10:04.320]  And so the goal here is to understand that if we're made in the image of God, even though
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:08.680]  all of this is happening, we have a role to play and whether they're going to crash the
[3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:11.760]  economy, there's always going to be ways to win, right?
[3:10:11.760 --> 3:10:15.680]  Number three is commodities are going to soar, right?
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:22.800]  One of the consequences of this Ukrainian-Russian situation is energy prices, which were already
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:25.120]  record highs, are going to soar even higher.
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:29.640]  That's oil stocks, uranium, 40% of all enriched uranium comes from Russia.
[3:10:29.640 --> 3:10:33.400]  You're going to see uranium stocks soar, right?
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:10:37.920]  And so what I've been trying to do to the best of my ability, and I'm by no means perfect
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:42.680]  at it, but I learned through my own trial and error of hitting the refreshed browser
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:47.200]  mentally and just constantly resetting in my head, we're screwed, we're screwed, we're
[3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:48.200]  screwed.
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:51.680]  And realizing this was keeping me broke, this was keeping me unhappy, all that stress is
[3:10:51.680 --> 3:10:56.040]  negatively affecting my health, I have no inspiration and I'm not being an inspiration
[3:10:56.040 --> 3:11:00.520]  or an example or help for anyone else, anyone else in my friends, my family, my community
[3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:01.520]  or my world.
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:06.560]  So when I started shifting my focus back to the theme of my theme for 2022 is to control
[3:11:06.560 --> 3:11:10.920]  what I can control, and this is not, this is exactly what Klaus Schwab doesn't want
[3:11:10.920 --> 3:11:11.920]  you to do.
[3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:13.960]  They don't want you to think about what they can control.
[3:11:13.960 --> 3:11:16.840]  This is why he said, prepare for an angrier world.
[3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:18.000]  They're not even hiding it anymore.
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:20.080]  They want you to be angry.
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:26.280]  The reason they want you to be angry is because again, this moves us back into a state of non-creative
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:30.600]  energy and when we're in a state of non-creative energy, we can't access the image of God in
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:35.480]  which we're made, we can't be transformed by the renewing of our own minds.
[3:11:35.480 --> 3:11:41.160]  And what happens is, then we knock ourselves out of the game and we become exactly like
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:44.560]  the people that sometimes we like to joke about.
[3:11:44.560 --> 3:11:48.640]  There's always going to be ways that you can protect and prepare yourself.
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:53.720]  Commodities are going to soar, regardless of what happens to the overall economy, you're
[3:11:53.720 --> 3:11:55.040]  going to see commodities soar.
[3:11:55.040 --> 3:11:58.920]  There's opportunities to make a lot of money in energy stocks, there's opportunities to
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:03.360]  make a lot of money in oil, there's opportunities to make a lot of money in uranium.
[3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:07.720]  The number four that I want to talk about is doing the inflation calculator.
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:12.560]  We're all aware, inflation is getting out of control.
[3:12:12.560 --> 3:12:14.480]  Federal Reserve said inflation is 7.5 percent.
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:19.640]  If you follow John Williams' shadow stats, maybe it's more 20, 25 percent.
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:25.280]  The German producer price index jumped 25 percent year over year, which is the highest
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:26.280]  since 1949.
[3:12:26.280 --> 3:12:30.080]  So you're seeing this globally, this move in inflation.
[3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:32.080]  Well, it's one thing to be aware of it.
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:36.080]  It's one thing to get mad at it, it's one thing to point out that the entire financial
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:41.240]  system is a Ponzi scheme and the ruling elite is really the people that are controlling
[3:12:41.240 --> 3:12:44.280]  the money streams more than anything else.
[3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:47.560]  But it's another thing to make sure that we protect ourselves.
[3:12:47.560 --> 3:12:52.280]  So one of the ways to start to use this anger and this creative energy is to improve our
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:57.120]  finances, to protect ourselves, protect our friends, protect our family, and to do more
[3:12:57.120 --> 3:12:58.840]  good in the world with.
[3:12:58.840 --> 3:13:01.160]  So do an inflation calculator.
[3:13:01.160 --> 3:13:04.920]  If inflation is 7.5 percent, do the math.
[3:13:04.920 --> 3:13:11.840]  This isn't even compounding, but let's just say 7.5 percent over five years, that comes
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:15.640]  out to 37.5 percent in a loss of purchasing power.
[3:13:15.640 --> 3:13:23.960]  So if you take the average American income of $50,000, they will lose $20,000 of those
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:27.280]  purchasing power without even realizing that's happening.
[3:13:27.280 --> 3:13:30.200]  That's not even factoring in taxes.
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:35.000]  So if you are aware inflation is happening, you have to start to use the image of God
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  in which you're created.
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:41.520]  You have to start to use your creative energy to offer more solutions, to improve your finances
[3:13:41.520 --> 3:13:45.600]  for yourself, for your friends, for your family, otherwise in a universe where energy is never
[3:13:45.600 --> 3:13:48.720]  created or destroyed, you can only create or disintegrate.
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:51.600]  Your finances are disintegrating right in front of your eyes.
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:58.000]  So pull out a pen and pad and I invite you, it's pretty fun in a weird way to do the math
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:01.320]  on it because you see how screwed we're getting in real time.
[3:14:01.320 --> 3:14:07.880]  If you factor that out over a 10-year period at 7.5 percent inflation, you are losing 75
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:12.120]  percent of your purchasing power.
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:14.720]  So then the next question goes to, well, what do I do about it?
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:20.720]  I do the inflation math calculator, I take how much I'm losing over a five-year period,
[3:14:20.720 --> 3:14:25.160]  then I take out my taxes and you're left with like 10 percent of your actual money.
[3:14:25.160 --> 3:14:29.560]  So then the thing is, well, I've got to solve that, I've got to solve it for my own freedom,
[3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:35.000]  so I'm prepared, so I have food storages, so I have safety supply, so I can protect
[3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:39.200]  my friends and my family that aren't as prepared, and so I have extra money to start building
[3:14:39.200 --> 3:14:42.720]  new movements, new causes, whatever it might be.
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:45.160]  And then what happens here is we go, well, there's nothing I can do about it.
[3:14:45.160 --> 3:14:46.160]  Well, they're censoring this.
[3:14:46.160 --> 3:14:48.600]  Well, they're doing this and they are, they're doing all of it.
[3:14:48.600 --> 3:14:51.840]  But we have to go back to empowering ourselves.
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:14:55.280]  This is the number one thing they do not want us to do.
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:15:00.360]  And one of the simple ways as I move on to point number five is to start to build multiple
[3:15:00.360 --> 3:15:03.680]  sources of income or multiple streams of a movement.
[3:15:03.680 --> 3:15:07.080]  Now, it's easy to think, well, I only have so many hours a day and I've already got this
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:14.880]  job, but if your job is a ceiling and therefore over a five-year period you're losing 30
[3:15:14.880 --> 3:15:19.080]  something percent of your purchasing power, you have to create more solutions.
[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:22.600]  We think of prepping as make sure you have your food storage, make sure you have your
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:23.600]  water.
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:28.240]  But if you are not fighting inflation with creative energy to move your income forward,
[3:15:28.240 --> 3:15:32.600]  you are actually preparing yourselves in one way or another for your own enslavement.
[3:15:32.600 --> 3:15:35.360]  And we're going to talk a little bit more about that here in a minute.
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:39.800]  But if you want to screw your head on right, learn how to detach yourself from this psychological
[3:15:39.800 --> 3:15:40.800]  warfare.
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:42.800]  Head right now to resetwars.com.

[3:15:56.560 --> 3:16:02.040]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[3:16:02.040 --> 3:16:07.760]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:11.960]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[3:16:11.960 --> 3:16:17.080]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[3:16:17.080 --> 3:16:21.960]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:26.400]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening and it's
[3:16:26.400 --> 3:16:28.760]  unbelievably unsettling to see.
[3:16:28.760 --> 3:16:31.280]  But there is only two things to do.
[3:16:31.280 --> 3:16:34.400]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:16:34.400 --> 3:16:37.760]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:42.400]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[3:16:42.400 --> 3:16:43.400]  an end.
[3:16:43.400 --> 3:16:48.760]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[3:16:48.760 --> 3:16:57.080]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios and life saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:17:02.520]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want and that you're
[3:17:02.520 --> 3:17:03.920]  going to be happy with.
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:07.200]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[3:17:07.200 --> 3:17:08.560]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[3:17:08.560 --> 3:17:13.160]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalist, and I'm able to do that because
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:15.600]  you buy products at infoorstore.com.
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:19.840]  And listen, all the products are great, but when it comes to high quality, storable food
[3:17:19.840 --> 3:17:26.320]  in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:28.000]  win, a no brainer.
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:31.520]  And they've got high quality, storable food ready to ship to you right now, the great
[3:17:31.520 --> 3:17:36.240]  folks at my page are supply exclusively for parallelx.com discounted.
[3:17:36.240 --> 3:17:39.680]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the info war.
[3:17:39.680 --> 3:17:45.920]  The only way you lose is not taking action at infoorstore.com or preparewithalex.com right
[3:17:45.920 --> 3:17:46.920]  now.
[3:17:46.920 --> 3:17:47.920]  This is high quality, storable food.
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:50.000]  This is how you beat inflation.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  Get yours today.
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:52.000]  It's ready to ship.
[3:17:52.000 --> 3:17:57.400]  But I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:17:58.400]  So I did it.
[3:17:58.400 --> 3:18:00.120]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[3:18:00.120 --> 3:18:04.800]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[3:18:04.800 --> 3:18:10.400]  and thank goodness for info wars store.com before I set out on a run, I throw down some
[3:18:10.400 --> 3:18:14.800]  turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going, you know, besides the energy
[3:18:14.800 --> 3:18:20.400]  turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and
[3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:25.360]  the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:27.160]  at getting through the training.
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:30.800]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore list.
[3:18:30.800 --> 3:18:32.400]  I have bad joints.
[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:33.400]  Thanks mom.
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:37.760]  And this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[3:18:37.760 --> 3:18:40.160]  support and extra flexibility.
[3:18:40.160 --> 3:18:44.720]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[3:18:44.720 --> 3:18:49.400]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can
[3:18:49.400 --> 3:18:53.400]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep

[3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:11.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:11.560 --> 3:20:17.360]  In just a moment, I'm going to show you some of the awesome, awesome stories that we're
[3:20:17.360 --> 3:20:22.160]  hearing about people moving through reset wars, but let's talk a little bit about something
[3:20:22.160 --> 3:20:29.200]  Alex breaks down in the reset wars course, which is inspiration.
[3:20:29.200 --> 3:20:33.200]  There's one thing to have knowledge and there's one thing to have inspiration and knowledge
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:38.320]  without the application of it has no inspiration and thus we create, as we talked about earlier,
[3:20:38.320 --> 3:20:43.440]  our own mental, spiritual and emotional gulag, which is exactly what they want to do.
[3:20:43.440 --> 3:20:47.760]  In the course, Alex breaks down the word inspiration and he breaks it down as really
[3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:52.480]  two words, in spirit, in spire, inspiration.
[3:20:52.480 --> 3:20:53.480]  What does that mean?
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:58.120]  It's when we're in spirit, it's when we're connected to God, when we're living from
[3:20:58.120 --> 3:21:03.040]  the consciousness that we're not only made in the image of God, but as we talk about
[3:21:03.040 --> 3:21:07.760]  Lord make me an instrument, it's when we're used as an instrument for a higher good to
[3:21:07.760 --> 3:21:13.080]  improve our own lives, to improve our family's lives, repair our community and whatever that
[3:21:13.080 --> 3:21:15.160]  information might be.
[3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:22.360]  Now, one of the ways that we can prepare ourselves for the great reset is to cleanse our mind,
[3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:28.400]  cleanse our spirit and to connect to God and ask ourselves, what's our role here?
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:34.480]  There's an old George Bernard Shaw quote and he says that the people that get on in this
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:38.560]  world are the people that look around for the circumstances that they want and if they
[3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:40.880]  can't find them, they create them.
[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:45.600]  One of the ways if we go back to the earlier theme, the transmutation of energy, that we
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:49.760]  can start to use this to create more solutions is to look around and see where you see a
[3:21:49.760 --> 3:21:50.760]  problem.
[3:21:50.760 --> 3:21:53.840]  Do you see a problem in the medical industry?
[3:21:53.840 --> 3:21:55.800]  Do you see a problem in the education industry?
[3:21:55.800 --> 3:21:59.720]  Do you see a problem in broadcasting and media, things that aren't being covered?
[3:21:59.720 --> 3:22:00.720]  Is it online?
[3:22:00.720 --> 3:22:02.040]  Are you a coder?
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:08.320]  Whatever it is and then devoting your energy and calling on God, calling on spirit to give
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:14.000]  you the creative energy and the resources in order to implement whatever this is, whatever
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:18.640]  it is that you're meant to do.
[3:22:18.640 --> 3:22:27.520]  This is the big question that the whole psychological word dynamic is designed to keep us from asking
[3:22:27.520 --> 3:22:34.200]  because it's about engaging us in the reactionary state of consciousness purely and I spent
[3:22:34.200 --> 3:22:39.720]  so much of my life when I learned all this information in a total reactionary state of
[3:22:39.720 --> 3:22:40.720]  consciousness.
[3:22:40.720 --> 3:22:45.120]  I was broke, I was angry, I wasn't doing anything about it to make the world a better place
[3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:48.760]  and I met a mentor and he said, well, you know, what do you want to do?
[3:22:48.760 --> 3:22:51.400]  And I said, well, I want to go travel, I want to do all these things.
[3:22:51.400 --> 3:22:53.200]  We said, well, why don't you do that?
[3:22:53.200 --> 3:22:54.520]  I said, well, I'm broke.
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:22:55.720]  And he said, well, why are you broke?
[3:22:55.720 --> 3:22:56.720]  And I said, I don't know.
[3:22:56.720 --> 3:22:57.960]  And he said, well, you don't help anyone.
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:22:59.560]  You don't do anything.
[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:01.920]  And I figured I thought, you know, I'm really awake.
[3:23:01.920 --> 3:23:07.560]  You know, I know all these things about the world, but I realized that I was using the
[3:23:07.560 --> 3:23:12.280]  transmutation of energy in order to move out of a creative state.
[3:23:12.280 --> 3:23:15.960]  I was living purely in a reactionary state of consciousness.
[3:23:15.960 --> 3:23:19.400]  And there's really only two modes of consciousness that we can live from.
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:24.640]  One is a creation state of consciousness and one is a reactionary state of consciousness.
[3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:30.640]  And in the Reset Wars course, I mentioned earlier, Alex talks about realizing how you
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:33.640]  become a victim to the New World Order.
[3:23:33.640 --> 3:23:37.520]  And when we think that we're awake, I noticed that it was easy for me to think that, you
[3:23:37.520 --> 3:23:39.960]  know, I'm not a victim, I'm awake to it.
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:44.400]  And then I realized that I had developed all of these self-defeating habits, beliefs and
[3:23:44.400 --> 3:23:49.960]  behavioral patterns designed off of how I saw the world, which I thought was from an
[3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:53.720]  awake lens that I'd taken the red pill and realized all these things.
[3:23:53.720 --> 3:23:57.400]  Yet I thought because the financial system was screwed, I couldn't do anything.
[3:23:57.400 --> 3:24:01.360]  You might think because of the medical system screwed, you can't improve upon the medical
[3:24:01.360 --> 3:24:06.640]  system, create your own private practices, the education screwed, the education system
[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:11.160]  screwed, there's nothing you can do about it, and on and on and on and on and on.
[3:24:11.160 --> 3:24:16.440]  And in the course in Reset Wars, what you're going to learn is you're going to discover
[3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:23.400]  what negative news cycles have become living beliefs or behavioral patterns that have stopped
[3:24:23.400 --> 3:24:27.560]  you from, you know, the old cliche quote is being the change that you want to see in
[3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:28.560]  the world.
[3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:32.440]  They've stopped you from creating action.
[3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:36.240]  And this, again, is exactly what they want to occur.
[3:24:36.240 --> 3:24:38.960]  They don't want us to create our own system.
[3:24:38.960 --> 3:24:41.360]  They don't want us to create new media outlets.
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:43.040]  They don't want us to create new websites.
[3:24:43.040 --> 3:24:46.200]  They don't want us to create new medical businesses.
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:48.440]  They don't want us to create new educational systems.
[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:53.120]  They want us to know exactly what's happening and remain angry.
[3:24:53.120 --> 3:24:56.680]  This is why Klaus Schwab said, prepare for an angrier world.
[3:24:56.680 --> 3:25:03.600]  And when we understand that all of reality is this, when we understand that all of reality
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:10.960]  is energy and all of reality is a psychological and mental warfare plane, what happens is
[3:25:10.960 --> 3:25:19.720]  that once they trap us into a feeling that they're in control, this only breeds disempowerment.
[3:25:19.720 --> 3:25:23.240]  And so we create our own enslavement.
[3:25:23.240 --> 3:25:28.960]  And in the Reset Wars course, Alex breaks down how we create our own enslavement from
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:33.480]  a mental level, from a spiritual level, from a psychological level, and how to break out
[3:25:33.480 --> 3:25:37.280]  of it.
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:41.840]  One of the things that when we were talking about putting together, Alex is putting together
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:47.720]  his book that's going to be out soon called The Great Reset and the War for the Future.
[3:25:47.720 --> 3:25:52.880]  And it's a mass market expose explaining the Great Reset, what you don't know about it,
[3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:57.560]  and more importantly, how we defeat him and how we win, how we actually beat the Great
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:25:58.560]  Reset.
[3:25:58.560 --> 3:26:05.360]  And as he was kind of wrapping up on organizing his thoughts on the ending chapter, he said,
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:09.680]  one of the most important things is we want people to learn all this information, but
[3:26:09.680 --> 3:26:11.280]  then do something about it.
[3:26:11.280 --> 3:26:13.400]  We want people to be like Joe Rogan.
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:16.800]  He said, you know, he'd been able to watch Joe Rogan since 2000.
[3:26:16.800 --> 3:26:18.840]  Joe learned all this information.
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:19.840]  And what did he do?
[3:26:19.840 --> 3:26:23.800]  He became the number one podcaster in the world, one of the top sports and media commentators
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:31.160]  in the world for the UFC, became a top level, a world top level martial artist, a top level
[3:26:31.160 --> 3:26:32.160]  comedian.
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:39.960]  He used all of this awakening to the world and started to channel it in creative ways.
[3:26:39.960 --> 3:26:42.760]  And the question is, how can you do that?
[3:26:42.760 --> 3:26:47.760]  The question is, how can you take that same creative energy that Alex was able to use
[3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:48.920]  to build infowars?
[3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:53.040]  How can you take that same creative energy in your existing job and your existing occupation
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:56.480]  and your existing day-to-day life to level up?
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:27:00.520]  Because the way that we're going to start to create these changes, and more importantly,
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:04.720]  even if we can't change it, the way that you're going to protect yourself, your friends and
[3:27:04.720 --> 3:27:09.320]  your family is by focusing on what you can control.
[3:27:09.320 --> 3:27:14.560]  And so in honor of that, we've got the reset wars, 50% off sale going on right now, learn
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:18.400]  exactly how to prepare yourself, your friends, for your family, even if you're insurance
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:20.600]  for you, do it for somebody else.
[3:27:20.600 --> 3:27:25.140]  Prepare for your children, prepare for your grandparents that can't get to the next level.
[3:27:25.140 --> 3:27:29.200]  We have no idea how much human potential we have access to.
[3:27:29.200 --> 3:27:31.680]  I like to think of it like a fingernail.
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:35.600]  It's like if you walked up to someone and you said that you were your fingernail, it's
[3:27:35.600 --> 3:27:39.300]  like one-tenth of one millionth percent of who you were.
[3:27:39.300 --> 3:27:43.240]  And what they want you to do is when they say, who are you?
[3:27:43.240 --> 3:27:45.240]  When you ask me, who am I?
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:46.800]  And I define myself by my body.
[3:27:46.800 --> 3:27:47.800]  I'm Jake.
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:48.800]  I'm this many years old.
[3:27:48.800 --> 3:27:49.800]  I have blue eyes.
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:50.800]  Here's how much I weigh.
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:55.280]  And I define myself based off of my physical experience, which traps us into lower dimensions
[3:27:55.280 --> 3:27:56.640]  of consciousness.
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:00.880]  And this is the time, as Patanjali said, he's a creator of the Yoga Sutras, and he said,
[3:28:00.880 --> 3:28:06.440]  once you're inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your bonds
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:12.120]  break their limitations, dormant forces become active, and you find yourself a more powerful
[3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:15.600]  person than you ever dreamed of.
[3:28:15.600 --> 3:28:22.560]  If we want to do something about it, you have to realize that you have a serious role to
[3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:23.560]  play.
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:28.000]  And it's not just, this is an important part, to prepare yourself to listen to Alex Jones,
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:32.720]  to listen to Info Wars every day, but then the next step is, how can you use this to
[3:28:32.720 --> 3:28:34.200]  create the ripple effect?

[3:29:00.880 --> 3:29:04.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[3:29:04.840 --> 3:29:08.400]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:14.040]  It's not the soil anymore, most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality
[3:29:14.040 --> 3:29:19.280]  triiodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your
[3:29:19.280 --> 3:29:23.200]  stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.

[3:29:32.960 --> 3:29:36.800]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[3:29:36.800 --> 3:29:41.160]  two weeks to kick it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:44.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:48.040]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:51.480]  what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds

[3:30:14.440 --> 3:30:16.880]  you buy products at infowarswars.com.
[3:30:16.880 --> 3:30:21.120]  And listen, all the products are great, but when it comes to high quality storeable food
[3:30:21.120 --> 3:30:27.560]  in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360
[3:30:27.560 --> 3:30:28.560]  win.
[3:30:28.560 --> 3:30:29.560]  Ain't no brainer.
[3:30:29.560 --> 3:30:32.000]  And they've got high quality storeable food ready to ship to you.

[3:30:47.480 --> 3:30:51.960]  This is high quality storeable food, this is how you beat inflation, get yours today,
[3:30:51.960 --> 3:30:56.000]  it's ready to ship, but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation
[3:30:56.000 --> 3:30:58.600]  is exploding.
[3:30:58.600 --> 3:31:02.840]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on
[3:31:02.840 --> 3:31:05.400]  both at home and the world at large.
[3:31:05.400 --> 3:31:10.680]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep
[3:31:10.680 --> 3:31:14.680]  support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[3:31:14.680 --> 3:31:19.480]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you
[3:31:19.480 --> 3:31:22.200]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[3:31:22.200 --> 3:31:27.000]  Need to improve upon our best selling product, knockout, with down and out, now the herbs
[3:31:27.000 --> 3:31:32.120]  and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[3:31:32.120 --> 3:31:36.920]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[3:31:36.920 --> 3:31:41.760]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally
[3:31:41.760 --> 3:31:46.880]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[3:31:46.880 --> 3:31:51.760]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will
[3:31:51.760 --> 3:31:53.760]  be down and out.
[3:32:22.400 --> 3:32:28.040]  you die in five or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[3:32:28.040 --> 3:32:33.280]  Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[3:32:33.280 --> 3:32:34.280]  you need.
[3:32:34.280 --> 3:32:37.840]  And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin
[3:32:37.840 --> 3:32:38.840]  D3.
[3:32:38.840 --> 3:32:43.480]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's
[3:32:43.480 --> 3:32:49.880]  offenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[3:32:54.440 --> 3:32:58.200]  it funds the info war 50% off.
[3:32:58.200 --> 3:33:11.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:11.800 --> 3:33:13.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:17.000]  Question, how are you liking the great reset, right?
[3:33:17.000 --> 3:33:23.240]  We know this is the early stages and only more of it's going to transpire.
[3:33:23.240 --> 3:33:27.440]  There's two things we can do, we can crawl in a ball with all of our knowledge and do
[3:33:27.440 --> 3:33:33.960]  nothing with it or we can get creative, prepare ourselves, create our own freedom regardless
[3:33:33.960 --> 3:33:37.720]  of what's happening in the world and regardless of what happens in certain countries, there's
[3:33:37.720 --> 3:33:41.680]  always going to be opportunities for people to thrive, for people to succeed and people
[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:42.680]  to have freedom.
[3:33:42.680 --> 3:33:45.800]  A lot of people won't believe that and they're going to curl in a ball and they're going
[3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:49.840]  to accept and essentially unconsciously create their own tyranny.
[3:33:49.840 --> 3:33:56.080]  That's why Alex put together reset wars, as we mentioned, 50% off.com, specialresetwars.com.
[3:33:56.080 --> 3:34:01.000]  I wanted to play another quick testimony here just to give you an idea of what's going on
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:06.920]  and give you an idea of what people are saying about reset wars and why it's so important
[3:34:06.920 --> 3:34:10.600]  so I'm going to have the team play another quick testimony here where you can see some
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:16.120]  of the stories of what's happening as people are starting to wake up in mass to reclaim
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:17.440]  their own power.
[3:34:17.440 --> 3:34:22.480]  Hey there fellow Info Warriors, I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:23.480]  reset wars.
[3:34:23.480 --> 3:34:28.160]  It's really powerful, so if you guys are looking to transcend the mind to a higher level, more
[3:34:28.160 --> 3:34:30.320]  advanced knowledge, then it's for you.
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:34.480]  They did a great job on getting everything together for this, you know, so if you guys
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:37.640]  are looking to take it to the next level, I'd definitely recommend it, so keep up the
[3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:40.760]  good fight and we are the resistance, so stand together.
[3:34:40.760 --> 3:34:46.080]  The way Alex lays out the most critical information makes it all very easy to absorb, but the
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:50.360]  confidence and hope gained from reset wars is priceless.
[3:34:50.360 --> 3:34:55.080]  This course has not only confirmed my purpose, but has given me the ability to walk in confidence
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:56.440]  towards my new path.
[3:34:56.440 --> 3:35:01.240]  The reset wars program is honestly one of the first times I've seen Alex at this deep
[3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:06.800]  level of God connection and love for the world and pushing out these good things with all
[3:35:06.800 --> 3:35:10.520]  the science, all the information to back it up, so I just want to say thank you to the
[3:35:10.520 --> 3:35:15.680]  InfoWars team and Alex for putting all this together, anybody would benefit from watching
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:16.680]  this program.
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:22.120]  When Alex goes into deep detail about what we're fighting against and who we are, we
[3:35:22.120 --> 3:35:26.680]  were created in God's image, we're children of God and we have the power to fight what's
[3:35:26.680 --> 3:35:31.960]  going on in this world, we have the power to fight it back and I just feel rejuvenated,
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:35.920]  I feel on fire, I feel like I'm ready to do this.
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:41.640]  This thing is off the hook and Alex Jones is trying to preserve tens of millions of
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:48.120]  lives with this program and you can help, I'm helping, if you want to change your life,
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:54.440]  if you think it could matter to you to change your life, try resetwars.com.
[3:35:54.440 --> 3:36:01.440]  So I really love the story of the woman there at the end that had the cross necklace and
[3:36:01.440 --> 3:36:05.840]  she was talking about how she essentially had regained her hope and optimism and her
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:12.080]  feeling that we are in control and there's something we can do about it and the way
[3:36:12.080 --> 3:36:19.840]  that this whole warfare is implemented and this reset is implemented from the control
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:26.840]  of social media algorithms to the control of news, it's all designed for us to essentially
[3:36:26.840 --> 3:36:31.200]  give up our own control and our own power.
[3:36:31.200 --> 3:36:38.720]  The whole goal goes back to the original term that they use so often of non-essential, right?
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:45.720]  We all realize we are not non-essential but the goal is from an unconscious level to feel
[3:36:45.720 --> 3:36:53.000]  like your time, your energy and who you are as a person is not essential to changing the
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:58.800]  world, that there's nothing we can do about it and this is just the way it is.
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:03.920]  But in fact, all achievement and all advancement of human civilization has pretty much come
[3:37:03.920 --> 3:37:08.760]  from ordinary everyday individuals, it's come from people outside of the regime, it's come
[3:37:08.760 --> 3:37:13.600]  from people outside of the status quo and it's essential, right?
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:24.120]  We're seeing it from the rollout in the medical field where we're seeing the medical tyranny
[3:37:24.120 --> 3:37:29.600]  rolled out, stopping people from getting access to medical treatments because of their vaccine
[3:37:29.600 --> 3:37:31.680]  status.
[3:37:31.680 --> 3:37:33.080]  So what does that show?
[3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:40.200]  Well, we need somebody that's either got the money, the creative energy, the medical expertise
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:44.760]  to start to create an alternative system, an alternative business and it starts in your
[3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:49.400]  own community, seeing the same thing in the education system, we're seeing the same thing
[3:37:49.400 --> 3:37:51.560]  in the financial system.
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:57.400]  And this can go on, we could talk over and over and over about how bad things are and
[3:37:57.400 --> 3:38:02.000]  we could just talk all day about how bad the news is or we could do a second thing and
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:05.720]  we could say, what do I control here?
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:09.400]  What do I control here and what can I improve upon?
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:15.480]  What is within my own control when I close my eyes and I connect to God and I say, God
[3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:17.600]  make me an instrument, what's my purpose here?
[3:38:17.600 --> 3:38:19.480]  What's my mission here?
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:24.080]  And what happens is, asking you to receive, instantly the answers come to us, whatever
[3:38:24.080 --> 3:38:29.120]  yours is, whatever your calling is, whatever the things that you can approve on, whatever
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:34.200]  the clear targets and goals you can set for yourself and for your family.
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:37.560]  But then what happens is, we ignore those callings.
[3:38:37.560 --> 3:38:40.560]  We ignore those callings and we say, well, it's so bad, there's nothing I can do about
[3:38:40.560 --> 3:38:41.560]  it.
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:44.160]  Well, there's censorship, well, I'm busy, well, there's all this bad stuff occurring.
[3:38:44.160 --> 3:38:48.480]  Well, what's the point of being doing anything if things are so bad anyways?
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:54.120]  And what happens is, we create our own tyranny and as we talked about earlier, it becomes
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:39:00.920]  our own gulag and the thing that I'm most excited about with everything that's going
[3:39:00.920 --> 3:39:06.240]  on at Infowars isn't just that the amount of people being reached is larger and larger
[3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:08.120]  and larger and larger.
[3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:14.800]  It's that Alex recognizes there's numerous parts to this Infowar and the next stage of
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:19.840]  this Infowar is to prepare as many people as possible and to create as many leaders
[3:39:19.840 --> 3:39:20.840]  as possible.
[3:39:20.840 --> 3:39:24.480]  And you're sitting here in this moment of time, although it may not seem like it, but
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:27.000]  it's the best time in human history to be alive.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:33.480]  There's never been a better time where you've had more access to tools, technology, to information
[3:39:33.480 --> 3:39:39.960]  and to knowledge for you to do something, whatever it is for you to do something.
[3:39:39.960 --> 3:39:46.600]  And it's so easy to forget that and it's so easy to just go right back into the mind
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:52.640]  viruses and right back into the negative habits that we built as a self-protective mechanism
[3:39:52.640 --> 3:39:57.800]  for all the stress, for all the anger, for all these very dense, worldly emotions that
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:00.520]  we rightfully feel.
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:09.920]  And we can beat this and we can win, but it's going to come from us getting connected
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:15.080]  to spirit, from us getting inspired and for us getting creative, for us to start to transmute
[3:40:15.080 --> 3:40:20.240]  in mass, the transmutation of energy in mass to offer solutions and it's the hundredth
[3:40:20.240 --> 3:40:21.600]  monkey effect.
[3:40:21.600 --> 3:40:25.520]  When other people see you doing something, when other people see you, well all this is
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:29.120]  going on, well I just doubled my business in spite of it, well all of this is going
[3:40:29.120 --> 3:40:34.000]  on, I just built this new movement in spite of it, that's the hundredth monkey effect
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:38.960]  where I'll connect to an unconscious collective mind and other people start to pick that
[3:40:38.960 --> 3:40:44.080]  up and other people, it's just like it's like you're wiping away the fog on other people's
[3:40:44.080 --> 3:40:49.360]  windshield and I just think, whoa, maybe I am powerful, whoa, maybe we can do something
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:57.840]  about it and it's easy to just keep waiting for someone else to do something and that's
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:03.960]  why we put together Reset Wars to be one of those playbooks, to be one of those practical
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:10.000]  guides, to be one of those step by step systems that can allow you to break out of this control
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:16.600]  grid, realize your own power and do something, anything.
[3:41:16.600 --> 3:41:25.600]  And so I was just out there in Texas working with Alex on helping him to organize some
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:29.840]  of his thoughts for his new book, Major Release Book, that's going to be coming out before
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:38.320]  the midterm elections, it's called The Great Reset and the War for Humanity and obviously
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:42.640]  we're out there while the next stage of this war has kicked into high gear and there's
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:47.520]  more and more crazy things happening and I was showing Alex some of these awesome new
[3:41:47.520 --> 3:41:52.440]  testimonials and everything that's gotten and he said, you're on air tomorrow, we're
[3:41:52.440 --> 3:41:58.880]  doing a new 50% off special, we need as many people as humanly possible in here to be going
[3:41:58.880 --> 3:42:00.840]  through the Reset Wars course.
[3:42:00.840 --> 3:42:04.520]  Now not only is this something that's life changing, not only is this something that's
[3:42:04.520 --> 3:42:09.520]  going to give you the tools and the optimism necessary to conquer everything that's happening
[3:42:09.520 --> 3:42:13.840]  right now, but it's in a very important way to fund the Info Wars movement.
[3:42:13.840 --> 3:42:18.120]  The next stage of The Great Reset is going to be collapse of supply change, energy crisis
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:21.680]  which is going to send the cost of shipping and goods even higher.
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:28.120]  And so putting together a digital aspect of the Info Wars business is a necessary component
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:29.440]  in staying on air.
[3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:34.520]  It's a necessary component to continue to fund the Info War and it's a 360 win because
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:39.200]  you're getting a step-by-step blueprint to protect and prepare yourself for The Great
[3:42:39.200 --> 3:42:40.200]  Reset.
[3:42:40.200 --> 3:42:45.440]  So head over to resetwars.com right now, you can go ahead and you can sign up.
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:47.600]  We love you to do as you move through it.
[3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:52.200]  Send us a video, let us know the awesome results, awakening shifts that occurred in your life
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:56.840]  from using it and we'd love to share your stories as we continue to inspire.
[3:42:56.840 --> 3:42:59.760]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:05.480]  And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting
[3:43:05.480 --> 3:43:12.600]  people taking vitamin D3 because it is essential and if you're not getting sunshine every single
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:16.040]  day whether you're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[3:43:16.040 --> 3:43:20.520]  Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the threats that are out there.
[3:43:20.520 --> 3:43:24.840]  It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen, you die in five
[3:43:24.840 --> 3:43:27.880]  or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[3:43:27.880 --> 3:43:32.920]  Well that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[3:43:32.920 --> 3:43:36.960]  you need and one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health
[3:43:36.960 --> 3:43:37.960]  is vitamin D3.
[3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:43.160]  We have the highest quality in winter sun with vitamin K that boosts all your body's
[3:43:43.160 --> 3:43:49.560]  offenses available right now for 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:43:49.560 --> 3:43:53.920]  Everybody old, young, black, white, you need vitamin D3, this is the best quality out there
[3:43:53.920 --> 3:43:58.080]  and it funds the infowar 50% off.
[3:43:58.080 --> 3:44:03.480]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:07.440]  happening in the atmosphere, but if you look at all the different studies and reports about
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:12.200]  my NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening
[3:44:12.200 --> 3:44:13.200]  with the climate.
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:19.520]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant, so yes, climate
[3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:24.520]  change is totally real, but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s
[3:44:24.520 --> 3:44:27.520]  and 80s and then it's going to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way
[3:44:27.520 --> 3:44:32.200]  they wanted it to, okay now it's just climate change, but did you know that man-made climate
[3:44:32.200 --> 3:44:38.320]  change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy
[3:44:38.320 --> 3:44:39.960]  and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:45.360]  They have weather control trees from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[3:44:45.360 --> 3:44:46.360]  for a very long time.
[3:44:46.360 --> 3:44:51.000]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:55.080]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather, so yes, man-made climate change is
[3:44:55.080 --> 3:44:56.080]  real.
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:45:03.960]  Two, life changing, life empowering products are now back in stock after being sold out
[3:45:03.960 --> 3:45:07.560]  for months at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:11.680]  Winter sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3, taken out of the tongue, it also
[3:45:11.680 --> 3:45:15.320]  has vitamin K, critical fear immune system and so much more.
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:19.340]  It's 50% off despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody
[3:45:19.340 --> 3:45:20.840]  needs this.
[3:45:20.840 --> 3:45:25.200]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter, you need what's in winter sun and then.
[3:45:25.200 --> 3:45:33.040]  We have brain force, ultra, super fast acting, amazing, clean, neutropic system that is a
[3:45:33.040 --> 3:45:36.920]  complement to brain force plus and of course turbo force.
[3:45:36.920 --> 3:45:41.200]  All three of these are different formulas, but all three of them take your mind and take
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:44.320]  your focus and clarity and alert us to the next level.
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:49.320]  It is 40% off at infowarstore.com for a limited time.
[3:45:49.320 --> 3:45:50.320]  Thank you all for your support.

[3:45:56.960 --> 3:46:02.440]  It's time to protect your privacy, it's time to come to grips with the fact that even though
[3:46:02.440 --> 3:46:07.880]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:13.000]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  you do.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:18.760]  In the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:22.960]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[3:46:22.960 --> 3:46:27.160]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:29.840]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[3:46:44.720 --> 3:46:45.720]  globalist.

[3:46:58.320 --> 3:47:11.800]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:11.800 --> 3:47:18.280]  Sometimes I like to imagine it's after life and I like to imagine, you know, I'm sitting
[3:47:18.280 --> 3:47:21.920]  there with God and I'm reviewing my life, right?
[3:47:21.920 --> 3:47:30.800]  Maybe I'm reviewing my life to decide whether I was able to fulfill my mission or not, whether
[3:47:30.800 --> 3:47:37.000]  I was, you know, going to go back and do it again in another third dimensional plane.
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:47.240]  And if you can imagine yourself there and you're reflecting on this life, what do you
[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:50.080]  think would be going on?
[3:47:50.080 --> 3:47:53.480]  Would you be able to say that you checked all the boxes?
[3:47:53.480 --> 3:47:58.200]  Would you be able to say that you used all of your God given talent?
[3:47:58.200 --> 3:48:04.240]  Were you able to say that you used all the inspiration, creative energy that you could
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:10.960]  to live Christ-like, create solutions, solve problems?
[3:48:10.960 --> 3:48:16.440]  Did you do everything you could to before you left to ensure your children had financial
[3:48:16.440 --> 3:48:22.640]  future, freedom, you know, who knows what the world would be like in another 20 years
[3:48:22.640 --> 3:48:27.600]  and in another 30 years and who knows if your children will have the same economic opportunities
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:29.880]  as you did or not.
[3:48:29.880 --> 3:48:35.200]  And while we still have these economic opportunities that we have, I believe that it's up to you,
[3:48:35.200 --> 3:48:43.400]  it's up to me to do the best we can to prepare ourselves for future generation.
[3:48:43.400 --> 3:48:49.240]  And so you're sitting there with God and you're going through this checklist.
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:55.480]  And the question is, here you are in the future or here you are in the afterlife, here you
[3:48:55.480 --> 3:48:58.440]  are reflecting on your life.
[3:48:58.440 --> 3:49:01.240]  What stones did you leave unturned?
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:07.640]  What things didn't you do that you could do right now back here in third dimension?
[3:49:07.640 --> 3:49:09.480]  What things were within your control?
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:17.280]  What ways did you, were you given the infinite creative energy of God that you have access
[3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:21.960]  to and can call upon and you didn't use it?
[3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:33.080]  In what ways did you incarnate here on arguably the easiest time to be alive in human history
[3:49:33.080 --> 3:49:38.560]  and the time in human history where you had the most tools possible to make the world a
[3:49:38.560 --> 3:49:45.000]  better place to stop what's happening, to improve your finances, to improve your health,
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:48.840]  to gather more knowledge and information, to take action.
[3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:51.600]  In what ways didn't you do it?
[3:49:51.600 --> 3:49:59.360]  And it's a question that could probably keep us thinking about for ages.
[3:49:59.360 --> 3:50:04.840]  In Bonnie Weir's book, The Top Regrets of the Dying, she was a palliative nurse and
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:08.400]  worked with people on their deathbeds and she surveyed thousands of them over a period
[3:50:08.400 --> 3:50:12.840]  of time and she found out that the number one regret people had on their deathbeds was
[3:50:12.840 --> 3:50:16.920]  they wished they would have lived the life true to themselves.
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:21.360]  And I believe that we all have a true self that's within us, not our worldly form, not
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:26.360]  the one that's programmed by all these social viruses that keep us in very low levels of
[3:50:26.360 --> 3:50:34.040]  consciousness and keep us from and keep us living in very low levels of our potential.
[3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:38.280]  But I think that there's this other true self that has a higher calling and I think that
[3:50:38.280 --> 3:50:43.560]  there's this other true self that's capable of more than we could ever imagine.
[3:50:43.560 --> 3:50:47.000]  And I think it goes back to that quote we were talking about earlier from Patanjali
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:55.280]  and he said, once you're inspired by some great goal, some extraordinary project that
[3:50:55.280 --> 3:51:01.400]  all of your bonds break their limitations, dormant forces become active.
[3:51:01.400 --> 3:51:02.400]  What does that mean?
[3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:03.560]  That dormant forces become active.
[3:51:03.560 --> 3:51:07.240]  Well, if we're made in the image of God, I mean the only person that isn't able to
[3:51:07.240 --> 3:51:13.560]  access this like weird level of human will isn't just like Alex Jones, this kid that
[3:51:13.560 --> 3:51:17.760]  was just recording in his closet as a teenager that ended up building one of the biggest
[3:51:17.760 --> 3:51:23.360]  media enterprises in the world, it's you, it's me, with whatever it is.
[3:51:23.360 --> 3:51:27.440]  And that's why we put together Reset Wars and that's why we're doing a 50% off special
[3:51:27.440 --> 3:51:30.000]  on Reset Wars.
[3:51:30.000 --> 3:51:34.200]  It's been funny to watch how much the censorship of it has occurred.
[3:51:34.200 --> 3:51:40.520]  There's been a lot of media articles about it and I'm just trying to spin it in their
[3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:44.320]  typical less than pleasing ways.
[3:51:44.320 --> 3:51:52.080]  But whether it's email servers recently, just getting some narration editing on some things,
[3:51:52.080 --> 3:51:57.960]  we got banned from five different audio narration websites for Reset Wars.
[3:51:57.960 --> 3:51:59.280]  We got banned from five of them.
[3:51:59.280 --> 3:52:01.640]  So the question is why?
[3:52:01.640 --> 3:52:03.360]  And it goes back to one thing.
[3:52:03.360 --> 3:52:07.720]  The reason they do not want this information out there is because they don't want people
[3:52:07.720 --> 3:52:08.720]  empowered.
[3:52:08.720 --> 3:52:12.640]  It doesn't matter how much information you know, information is one thing and knowledge
[3:52:12.640 --> 3:52:14.720]  is the application of it.
[3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:19.240]  It's the application of it that has them afraid, it's the application of us, of it that has
[3:52:19.240 --> 3:52:24.520]  them concerned, it's the application of it that they do not want out there, right?
[3:52:24.520 --> 3:52:26.240]  Because that's how we build the new system.
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:31.000]  That's how we do what Buck Minister said, is not to fight the old system, but to build
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:35.960]  a new one and make the old model obsolete and it's up to you and it's up to me and it's
[3:52:35.960 --> 3:52:40.120]  up to all of the millions of people listening for us to start to do that and for us to get
[3:52:40.120 --> 3:52:44.480]  empowered and for us to find hope and optimism for ourselves, for our friends, for our family
[3:52:44.480 --> 3:52:45.960]  and for our world.
[3:52:45.960 --> 3:52:49.600]  And so we're doing a 50% off special at resetwars.com.
[3:52:49.600 --> 3:52:54.960]  I want to have the team play a quick video of some of the awesome stories of people that
[3:52:54.960 --> 3:52:57.640]  are moving through the Reset Wars course.
[3:52:57.640 --> 3:53:01.680]  So if we could have the team play a quick video and I'll be back in a moment, I want
[3:53:01.680 --> 3:53:07.800]  to encourage you to head to resetwars.com and sign up right now.
[3:53:07.800 --> 3:53:12.200]  Inside you, like me, fire is burning, something needs to change.
[3:53:12.200 --> 3:53:16.680]  I just want to reach out and give a recommendation to reset wars.
[3:53:16.680 --> 3:53:17.680]  It's really powerful.
[3:53:17.680 --> 3:53:23.160]  Reset wars was absolutely amazing and eye-opening and revolutionary.
[3:53:23.160 --> 3:53:27.920]  If you want to change your life for the better, I highly recommend this to Alex.
[3:53:27.920 --> 3:53:30.240]  Thank you very much for putting the course together.
[3:53:30.240 --> 3:53:32.320]  I found it to be awesome.
[3:53:32.320 --> 3:53:33.680]  It was worth it to me.
[3:53:33.680 --> 3:53:39.680]  You have taken ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific
[3:53:39.680 --> 3:53:40.680]  knowledge.
[3:53:40.680 --> 3:53:41.680]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[3:53:41.680 --> 3:53:48.440]  So what you're about to see is a lengthy, powerful, well-documented spectrum of information
[3:53:48.440 --> 3:53:53.640]  and experiences and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is definitely
[3:53:53.640 --> 3:53:54.640]  a threat.
[3:53:54.640 --> 3:53:59.480]  To think the way we are intended to think by God, that's what this series is about.
[3:53:59.480 --> 3:54:04.480]  Reset wars has been a great tool during this time of uncertainty and it has rejuvenated
[3:54:04.480 --> 3:54:05.480]  my hope.
[3:54:05.480 --> 3:54:10.120]  It's been helping me a lot with a lot that's going on in my life.
[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:14.080]  Everybody needs to purchase this product and watch it and then share the information far
[3:54:14.080 --> 3:54:15.080]  and wide.
[3:54:15.080 --> 3:54:21.520]  There is an awakening, join in to help yourself and others to wake up.
[3:54:21.520 --> 3:54:27.640]  Reset wars has been a great tool in both recapping what I've come to already know and also learn
[3:54:27.640 --> 3:54:28.640]  new material.
[3:54:28.640 --> 3:54:29.640]  I'm not disappointed.
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:32.120]  I plan on sharing it with as many people as possible.
[3:54:32.120 --> 3:54:35.920]  I hear you coming more and more with that and I feel it more and more.
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:36.920]  It's moving me.
[3:54:36.920 --> 3:54:41.400]  We need to have courage and focus in order to accomplish that mission and I felt like
[3:54:41.400 --> 3:54:43.960]  I got a lot of that from reset wars as well.
[3:54:43.960 --> 3:54:48.260]  The confidence and hope gained from reset wars is priceless.
[3:54:48.260 --> 3:54:49.600]  This isn't magic.
[3:54:49.600 --> 3:54:57.400]  This is the real code of the universe or what Max Plank 120 plus years ago called the matrix.
[3:54:57.400 --> 3:55:03.360]  Start your journey to true freedom now at resetwars.com.
[3:55:03.360 --> 3:55:07.400]  So welcome back to the Alex Jones show and I'm here in honor of reset wars.
[3:55:07.400 --> 3:55:12.360]  You can head over to resetwars.com right now and sign up.
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:18.560]  And you know, I was thinking, there's so much crazy things happening earlier.
[3:55:18.560 --> 3:55:25.480]  We were talking a little bit about the digital gulag and I was, if you're just joining right
[3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:36.440]  now, I was reading a little bit about Ukraine, Makhalo Fedorov and I'm probably pronouncing
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:37.440]  his name wrong.
[3:55:37.440 --> 3:55:44.000]  He's the Ukraine ministers of digital transformation, digital transformation.
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:48.640]  And he said, when we allow a person to register a business in three clicks, when we allow
[3:55:48.640 --> 3:55:53.160]  them to pay their taxes in two clicks, no matter how skeptical a person is about the
[3:55:53.160 --> 3:55:56.760]  technology, they will start to use our services.
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:56:03.160]  And he says, quote, we need to build a state in a smartphone, which aims by 2024 to have
[3:56:03.160 --> 3:56:08.560]  100% of all government services available online, with 20% of services provided automatically
[3:56:08.560 --> 3:56:14.400]  without the intervention of an official, 20% of those services coming in automatically,
[3:56:14.400 --> 3:56:15.400]  right?
[3:56:15.400 --> 3:56:18.440]  And then we think about what happened in Canada and the bank freezes, and then we see those
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:22.440]  clips of just innocent Russians, they have nothing to do with the government, they have
[3:56:22.440 --> 3:56:25.880]  nothing to do with war, they're just citizens that all of a sudden they can't access their
[3:56:25.880 --> 3:56:26.880]  banking.
[3:56:26.880 --> 3:56:31.820]  Apple pay, shut them down, Google pay, shut them down, going cashless means your ability
[3:56:31.820 --> 3:56:36.760]  to even exist in a society can be simply shut off at any time.
[3:56:36.760 --> 3:56:41.360]  So I like that last part because it can shut off your ability at any time.
[3:56:41.360 --> 3:56:45.640]  That's what's going to happen to a lot of people that have not taken action, they have
[3:56:45.640 --> 3:56:50.320]  not taken control of their life and they have not started to control what they can control.
[3:56:50.320 --> 3:56:58.440]  They may use this whole system to shut off all of the dissonance.
[3:56:58.440 --> 3:57:02.680]  But when you understand that you're made in the image of God, you can build the prosperity,
[3:57:02.680 --> 3:57:07.960]  the abundance, the success, and the resources necessary to not only survive anything that's
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:13.760]  happening but to thrive for whatever's happened, for yourself, for your friends, for your family.
[3:57:13.760 --> 3:57:18.720]  Use this energy not to get angry and not to get stressed, but use it as a sense of urgency
[3:57:18.720 --> 3:57:25.360]  and use it as a creative energy to right now feel the doors closing and now use this sense
[3:57:25.360 --> 3:57:30.120]  of urgency for creativity, it's the transmutation of energy.
[3:57:30.120 --> 3:57:35.520]  Right now, screw your head on right, go to resetwars.com right now, 50% off, and start

[3:57:45.040 --> 3:57:57.040]  It has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth and the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[3:57:57.040 --> 3:58:04.800]  No, that invariably follows, but first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty
[3:58:04.800 --> 3:58:10.120]  and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the United States to
[3:58:10.120 --> 3:58:20.280]  Europe, legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information,
[3:58:20.280 --> 3:58:25.960]  you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned and of course now Canada
[3:58:25.960 --> 3:58:31.520]  is under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they think you may have
[3:58:31.520 --> 3:58:37.760]  the intent to engage in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested.
[3:58:37.760 --> 3:58:41.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[3:58:41.600 --> 3:58:46.560]  the world against humanity that makes them followers.com more important than ever.
