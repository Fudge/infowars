[00:12.000 --> 00:30.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.840]  we're live my friends it is Monday the 24th day of May 2010 we're gonna be live
[00:37.840 --> 00:44.040]  here for the next four hours Christopher C. Horner his new book power grab how
[00:44.040 --> 00:50.000]  Obama's green policies will steal your freedom and bankrupt America he'll be
[00:50.000 --> 00:55.520]  joining us coming up in the last hour today in the first three hours of the
[00:55.520 --> 01:01.600]  radio broadcast I'm gonna go over massive stacks of vitally important news on
[01:01.600 --> 01:09.440]  basically every subject under the Sun interspersed with your phone calls and I
[01:09.440 --> 01:18.400]  want to hear what you have to say about all the issues that we are going to be
[01:18.400 --> 01:28.960]  covering here today I want to discuss it all whether it's revealed how Israel
[01:28.960 --> 01:35.680]  offered to sell South Africa nuclear weapons or the fact that there's a
[01:35.680 --> 01:40.360]  populist constitutionalist realignment that's clearly happened we're all
[01:40.360 --> 01:50.600]  incumbents in the last round of primary elections they have all lost if it's an
[01:50.600 --> 01:54.280]  establishment Democrat in the primary they lose to the anti-establishment
[01:54.280 --> 02:02.380]  Democrat if it's an establishment Republican they lose to the anti-
[02:02.380 --> 02:06.400]  establishment Republican and in the few cases where you have a seat being
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.560]  replaced by someone who's died you have Republicans taking it away from
[02:11.560 --> 02:18.480]  Democrats and we've never seen something like this happen before normally one
[02:18.480 --> 02:22.400]  party's in favor the other party's out of favor the good news here is there is a
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.760]  massive political realignment against incumbents and the establishment
[02:28.760 --> 02:33.760]  against the New World Order what does a big to Brzezinski say last week he said
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.880]  for the first time in history period the entire world is awake to the true
[02:38.880 --> 02:47.160]  political structure and that makes it hard for the world government that makes
[02:47.160 --> 02:56.720]  it hard for the world government because we're now aware of what they're
[02:56.720 --> 03:03.760]  doing we're now awake to what they are doing we've got a fighting chance at this
[03:03.760 --> 03:06.840]  that's why the bankers are going for everything they're trying to destroy the
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.600]  world economy to make us dependent on them now they're trying to move in with
[03:10.600 --> 03:15.440]  the hardcore police state now though that reveals them to the planet at an
[03:15.440 --> 03:20.200]  even greater level they know that down the road things just get tougher for
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.240]  them as more people really get educated on the deep politics of the real
[03:25.240 --> 03:32.360]  situation we're facing as a society the true geopolitical landscape here's top

[08:55.480 --> 08:59.720]  haven't had time to go over it yet saying okay he's gonna edit the race for
[08:59.720 --> 09:11.360]  stuff out of his film so there you have it we have the script we knew what was
[09:11.360 --> 09:16.920]  in it I know it's dangerous I know it's racist I know it creates division and I
[09:16.920 --> 09:21.920]  never called for him to edit his film I simply stated that he was on the hook
[09:21.920 --> 09:27.960]  for it when it caused violence and there's no doubt it would generate at
[09:27.960 --> 09:35.280]  least some copycat violence but I'm gonna go back over that coming up for
[09:35.280 --> 09:44.400]  about 10 15 minutes in the third hour today now here's what I want to do I

[15:22.040 --> 15:27.720]  welcome Alex this may be an old news item that crossed your desk before it's
[15:27.720 --> 15:33.800]  from August 2008 California activist proposes wealth tax and probably
[15:33.800 --> 15:39.800]  probable unconstitutional exit tax where they want to tax you at like 55% if
[15:39.800 --> 15:45.680]  you decide to bug out of California it's unbelievable also know the news items
[15:45.680 --> 15:50.880]  Chicago Tribune quiet border towns don't live up to their notoriety they're
[15:50.880 --> 15:54.840]  spreading the propaganda that there's no problem on the US side of the border
[15:54.840 --> 16:00.240]  everything's fine come on down what do you say well those are both excellent
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.880]  points and I did see that idea floated a few years ago to have an exit tax and
[16:06.880 --> 16:11.440]  they've already put exit taxes into the US that go into effect next year I mean
[16:11.440 --> 16:14.520]  they'd ratchet a few up over the years but the big ones go in next year that's
[16:14.520 --> 16:20.720]  why all the money I mean the big money is all been leaving the last three years
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.200]  it's a mass exodus because they know they're calling in a government airstrike
[16:25.200 --> 16:29.000]  on the country most of them are involved in it so they're you know getting out of
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.880]  the way of their own stage terror attacks and financial implosions
[16:33.880 --> 16:38.640]  they're all running off to Caribbean and Mediterranean islands and South
[16:38.640 --> 16:43.880]  American islands and armored redoubts in the Cook Islands and so that's going on
[16:43.880 --> 16:51.280]  and listen folks California has collapsed okay it has collapsed Mexico has
[16:51.280 --> 16:57.640]  collapsed and the Texas border hadn't been safe in a decade but now I've had
[16:57.640 --> 17:03.880]  family that's gone down their own business and everything's boarded up the
[17:03.880 --> 17:08.240]  hotels are shut down it is a war zone you can hear machine gun fire every night
[17:08.240 --> 17:13.880]  media's that speaks out against it is killed hang grenade attacks truck bombs
[17:13.880 --> 17:18.960]  kidnappings mass murder everywhere ranchers being slaughtered even nice
[17:18.960 --> 17:22.680]  ranchers who put out water for the illegals the coyotes just come in and
[17:22.680 --> 17:26.040]  kill them because they want to have the ranch house for themselves the police
[17:26.040 --> 17:31.440]  cower literally with the yellow streams going down their legs I've had sheriff
[17:31.440 --> 17:35.400]  or sheriff on who were robbed at gunpoints the Mexican troops will come
[17:35.400 --> 17:39.360]  up to their police stations up to their cars pull guns on the police get down
[17:39.360 --> 17:43.920]  on their ground basically lick their boots and it's just it's just total
[17:43.920 --> 17:49.040]  implosion of society all by CIA design and this is all part of the North
[17:49.040 --> 17:53.040]  American Union but and I'm supposed to be real proud of it and love it and say
[17:53.040 --> 17:57.520]  yes Felipe called Iran take my semi-automatic guns you are my king I

[18:26.240 --> 18:29.600]  trouble I got a DOI not too long ago and I'm not even allowed to step foot in
[18:29.600 --> 18:35.600]  Canada for the next five years well but meanwhile the illegal aliens are above
[18:35.600 --> 18:40.760]  the long that's right and it's admitted you have had illegals calling and go yeah
[18:40.760 --> 18:45.680]  I get let go for drinking and driving so what because again they're key to
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.680]  bringing the country down do you know if there's any more as far as needing
[18:50.680 --> 18:56.180]  passports to go between states the feds are saying that under federal
[18:56.180 --> 18:59.900]  jurisdiction under the real ID act they're gonna set up and this was back
[18:59.900 --> 19:03.920]  under Clinton but now it's official hardened checkpoints to go from state to
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.080]  state claiming that under interstate commerce the feds now control the state
[19:09.080 --> 19:13.480]  borders and hence the states and the feds are saying to go to national park
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.720]  or to fly on an airplane or to have a job or file any taxes or get a bank
[19:17.720 --> 19:22.200]  account or a car loan or a rental car or any of the thousands of things under
[19:22.200 --> 19:27.320]  patriot act compliance that you will have to have the real ID act ID card to
[19:27.320 --> 19:33.160]  have a job but again the illegals are all by executive fiat given waivers and
[19:33.160 --> 19:39.000]  selective enforcement so again as I say we the American people are the roaches
[19:39.000 --> 19:43.240]  we're not allowed to get out of the country we're here for one reason and
[19:43.240 --> 19:48.840]  one reason only we're here to be bled dry and worship government land of the

[24:50.360 --> 24:53.640]  ernie in california ernie you're on the air
[24:53.640 --> 24:57.000]  hey alex real quick i'm going to be fast just like you said okay
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.840]  hey on the 21st governor brewer of arizona did a little interview with
[25:00.840 --> 25:03.800]  gretchen uh... uh... what's her name gretchen uh...
[25:03.800 --> 25:09.080]  gretta van sestern yeah there you go and this lady was right on and it's
[25:09.080 --> 25:11.960]  basically the government's not doing nothing
[25:11.960 --> 25:15.960]  just like this oil spill which personally i think is a hella burton job
[25:15.960 --> 25:19.320]  this is a disaster of obama they're looking at it like it's nothing and
[25:19.320 --> 25:22.360]  just one weird thing i was watching the movie knowing with
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.520]  uh... nicolas cage the other day and one of the disasters on the prediction
[25:26.520 --> 25:29.320]  was an oil rig in the middle of the golf on fire
[25:29.320 --> 25:33.560]  are they sticking in their face again and that's all i got to say in my
[25:33.560 --> 25:37.080]  other than that i am against the new world order and pushing out for our
[25:37.080 --> 25:40.920]  videos as much as i can but this lady's on this administration
[25:40.920 --> 25:43.960]  is pushing the new world and they're laughing and destroying our country on
[25:43.960 --> 25:49.480]  the ocean and on the inside thank you well thank you yeah 35 36 days into this
[25:49.480 --> 25:52.200]  i think they blew it up on purpose more and more
[25:52.200 --> 25:58.040]  you say why would bp do this why would well bp
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.480]  is the main funder of sustainability ie land grabbing
[26:01.480 --> 26:05.800]  bp is the main pusher of the global warming taxes on record
[26:05.800 --> 26:09.640]  that they were the main sponsor of the copenhagen trading and the globalists
[26:09.640 --> 26:13.960]  are all about falling on their sword and being rebuilt later
[26:13.960 --> 26:17.640]  and so they pay a few billion bucks but in the cost of oil going up they make a
[26:17.640 --> 26:20.520]  few billion extra and then it becomes a great
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.040]  political diversion for all the legislation moving
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.520]  its way through congress and the gear up towards war
[26:28.520 --> 26:33.720]  and this very oil rig was given awards by obama
[26:33.720 --> 26:37.640]  two hours before they were reporting problems they've been lying about it
[26:37.640 --> 26:40.120]  since day one he had announced they were going to allow
[26:40.120 --> 26:44.280]  offshore drilling everywhere and then suddenly this happens and it's always
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.320]  well it's actually bp that gets most of the alaska oil
[26:47.320 --> 26:49.960]  that's what what a sweetheart deal they've got with our government
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.640]  they're so elite owned by the queen of the netherlands and the queen of england
[26:53.640 --> 26:57.400]  are the two partners biggest partners in it
[26:57.400 --> 27:00.760]  that now this is going to allow a shutdown of oil drilling all
[27:00.760 --> 27:05.080]  over not just the coastlines of the u.s but inside the u.s and i could go on and
[27:05.080 --> 27:08.760]  on it's taken me over a month i've just let the information
[27:08.760 --> 27:12.120]  collate you know i mean a good cop will call it a
[27:12.120 --> 27:16.520]  hunch it's not really a hunch folks it's it's it's the human brain you've got
[27:16.520 --> 27:21.560]  the incredible uh... super computer and i just get all the data and then a lot
[27:21.560 --> 27:24.520]  of times i can't even tell you why
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.760]  you know simply i think it's an inside job
[27:28.760 --> 27:32.280]  i just suddenly in my gut know and and and then i could go over all the evidence
[27:32.280 --> 27:36.200]  which we just covered some of it it's just a it's my gut

[33:01.480 --> 33:05.240]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents
[33:05.240 --> 33:17.080]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[33:17.080 --> 33:23.560]  folks on a similar vein along the lines of the oil spilled the globalists are
[33:23.560 --> 33:27.960]  into the occult and they're into numerology and they believe that they
[33:27.960 --> 33:31.800]  have to tell you what they're going to do before they do it
[33:31.800 --> 33:35.400]  that's why they had tv ads radio ads print ads
[33:35.400 --> 33:39.480]  movies uh in the lead-up
[33:39.480 --> 33:43.080]  two nine eleven where they told you on nine eleven we're going to blow up the
[33:43.080 --> 33:46.920]  world trade center to the point of i was able to go on air
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.560]  six months before three months before and specifically two months before
[33:51.560 --> 33:55.560]  and lay out how and when it was going to happen and that's on record
[33:55.560 --> 33:59.240]  remember they had lone gunman episodes with a government hijack so
[33:59.240 --> 34:02.680]  jumbo jet by remote control to fly it in the world trade center
[34:02.680 --> 34:07.080]  and uses a drill to make norad stand down they're gonna blame it on afghanistan
[34:07.080 --> 34:10.920]  the exact same thing happened we just confirmed my wife kept telling me to
[34:10.920 --> 34:13.480]  watch this nicolas cage movie but i didn't have time
[34:13.480 --> 34:17.320]  called knowing and it's about the end of the world and basically aliens
[34:17.320 --> 34:21.880]  rapture us it's like a ufo cult meets revelations
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.080]  and we just went and watched the clip on the tv screen
[34:25.080 --> 34:30.040]  from the film as he's waking up april 20th
[34:30.040 --> 34:35.720]  there is a oil rig explosion in the gulf of mexico in a huge oil leak
[34:35.720 --> 34:42.040]  and this is april 20th 2010 in the movie well guess what happened on april
[34:42.040 --> 34:45.320]  20th 2010 and the folks that pointed this out
[34:45.320 --> 34:48.600]  from the knowing it's a youtube clip of it
[34:48.600 --> 34:52.360]  they point out they show the so-called cnn reporter on the knowing
[34:52.360 --> 34:56.120]  and then they cut the real cnn reporter saying almost word for word the same
[34:56.120 --> 34:59.800]  thing this is just like oil storm uh that they made
[34:59.800 --> 35:02.920]  for tv movie where they even got the mayor
[35:02.920 --> 35:05.880]  of new orleans to be in it about a hurricane hitting
[35:05.880 --> 35:09.160]  and it flooding everything and people going to the super dome
[35:09.160 --> 35:15.720]  they love throwing it in our face and yes i've had
[35:15.720 --> 35:19.640]  been living in the father of weather weapons on stanford research institute
[35:19.640 --> 35:22.840]  67 they've been creating and controlling and steering
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.320]  hurricanes since the early 60s but us government certified
[35:27.320 --> 35:31.080]  in 1967 and that's up on prison planet dot tv
[35:31.080 --> 35:34.040]  that full interview if you want to watch it from four years ago

[35:48.440 --> 35:52.360]  the plausible deniability of putting this in their movies
[35:52.360 --> 35:56.840]  and if they are starting to plant things because
[35:56.840 --> 36:00.040]  i'm now reading the synopsis looks like it has north korea in the movie a bunch
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.640]  of and now that started up the globalists just love to play god that's why
[36:03.640 --> 36:07.400]  they love weather control tectonic weapons
[36:07.400 --> 36:11.160]  and this is a conspiracy theory this is conspiracy fact
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.480]  that they that that they do this kind of stuff so we go live on tv next hour
[36:15.480 --> 36:20.440]  i'm going to get into this uh and
[36:20.440 --> 36:25.080]  why the globalists engage in these type of activities

[38:09.080 --> 38:12.200]  uh to condition the public and and and why they do it
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.680]  how it's like a psychopathic calling card you know like psychos like to taunt
[38:16.680 --> 38:20.280]  the police department before they strike again but they also believe that
[38:20.280 --> 38:25.720]  it gives them more magical power in the first level of the lesser magic uh to
[38:25.720 --> 38:28.120]  make the announcement publicly beforehand
[38:28.120 --> 38:31.880]  nicolas cage made a film called the knowing my wife says it's
[38:31.880 --> 38:37.720]  powerful i've read the synopsis i haven't seen it have you seen the knowing

[39:11.960 --> 39:17.720]  giant oil rig blows up with an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.120]  and this is one of the trigger points for the aliens slash angels
[39:22.120 --> 39:25.720]  to have a rapture of the good humans before they blow the earth up
[39:25.720 --> 39:29.000]  um

[40:05.400 --> 40:07.800]  in but people won't be able to grasp it
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.240]  Watson unless you explain the revelation of the method to them and then give them
[40:11.240 --> 40:14.280]  past blaring examples uh so let's get that done how
[40:14.280 --> 40:19.960]  fast can you get something out on this uh i'll get on it straight away

[40:31.160 --> 40:34.360]  just say this live on air because Watson has a bad phone and i've been for two
[40:34.360 --> 40:37.640]  years calling for this the procrastination will end this week
[40:37.640 --> 40:41.160]  we're going to get Watson on skype audio at least okay
[40:41.160 --> 40:44.920]  okay yeah but i don't want to wait just to send him a camera
[40:44.920 --> 40:47.720]  because he's going with this whole camera line to mail it to england and get it
[40:47.720 --> 40:50.600]  hooked up i want to have him on tomorrow
[40:50.600 --> 40:53.400]  with the video skype connection he's got
[40:53.400 --> 40:57.080]  okay i don't see because there's that there's a thing in society
[40:57.080 --> 41:00.920]  and all patriots do it the general public does it we always want to do
[41:00.920 --> 41:04.680]  something perfect before we do it imagine when lewis of clark
[41:04.680 --> 41:08.440]  have gone across the country if they'd have waited to have it done perfectly to
[41:08.440 --> 41:11.640]  have like a three-lane you know highway on both sides black top
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.360]  paid with rest stops every mile no okay it's not a big deal this is not

[41:34.680 --> 41:38.200]  you know what i mean it almost does a disservice for me to even come on air
[41:38.200 --> 41:41.400]  and talk about this we ought to be running around the streets pulling our
[41:41.400 --> 41:46.280]  hair out screaming and yelling i mean i i was sent an internal
[41:46.280 --> 41:50.520]  big brother video
[41:50.520 --> 41:54.760]  for government in england by a security contractor about face scanning body
[41:54.760 --> 41:57.720]  recognition technology and about how it's the government
[41:57.720 --> 42:01.320]  against the people and i just i can't even watch it it's so evil
[42:01.320 --> 42:04.840]  and and the sickening narrator they got you know who
[42:04.840 --> 42:08.120]  who'll be like a movie star to the psychopath government people that watch
[42:08.120 --> 42:11.400]  it and it should be ruled by a bunch of inbred psychopaths that
[42:11.400 --> 42:14.920]  think it's funny all the stuff they do and i know the public thinks it's funny
[42:14.920 --> 42:19.160]  when i tell you your water supply is being poisoned and of course they're
[42:19.160 --> 42:22.680]  not letting people clean up the oil of course they're going to let it all come
[42:22.680 --> 42:25.720]  in of course they want a bigger disaster to
[42:25.720 --> 42:29.560]  get more funds and more power nobody gets in trouble
[42:29.560 --> 42:35.240]  when fema blocks the aid in Katrina and cuts the police communication lines
[42:35.240 --> 42:38.280]  they get more power and of course they get more power
[42:38.280 --> 42:42.200]  when they let all the oil flood in and keep it gushing
[42:42.200 --> 42:47.480]  and now they're going to shut down all of bp's competition bp is so powerful
[42:47.480 --> 42:52.920]  british petroleum they're the only company allowed to export 80 percent of
[42:52.920 --> 43:00.760]  the oil to asia out of alaska they've got to do a lot duopoly up there
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.560]  they're the big carbon tax people their whole Copenhagen thing fell apart
[43:05.560 --> 43:08.360]  so of course they rigged this whole deal and of course they're letting it and
[43:08.360 --> 43:11.560]  they're never going to cap it they found a big old gusher
[43:11.560 --> 43:14.200]  blew the lid off of it they're going to turn the whole gulf of mexico into an
[43:14.200 --> 43:18.680]  oil bath they're going to teach you how to be a slave
[43:19.400 --> 43:24.520]  april 20th deepwater horizon deepwater oil drill rig explodes and catches fire

[44:08.680 --> 44:11.560]  this is going straight through these people you understand that
[44:11.560 --> 44:15.240]  the only way we're going to get out of this is to break the spell we're under
[44:15.240 --> 44:19.640]  and to stop these devils into the ground and that means
[44:19.640 --> 44:23.400]  everything they're for i'm against they're for vaccines i'm against it

[46:19.880 --> 46:24.200]  most evil person on earth now i was thinking about it this weekend
[46:24.200 --> 46:29.160]  it was the 2006 9-11 anniversary and i was in new york city five years
[46:29.160 --> 46:34.200]  after and i was on ktsa with i think tre where was the
[46:34.200 --> 46:37.400]  host and he didn't attack me for being a 9-11
[46:37.400 --> 46:41.400]  truther he didn't call me names he let me put out evidence
[46:41.400 --> 46:47.000]  and he really in a heartfelt way he said alex
[46:48.200 --> 46:52.040]  you better hope you're right about what you say about 9-11 because this is all
[46:52.040 --> 46:54.520]  on you
[46:54.520 --> 46:59.640]  you're gonna have to answer for god for the information you're putting out and
[46:59.640 --> 47:02.440]  you you better hope you're right as bad as this
[47:02.440 --> 47:05.320]  information is and you know what it felt good when he said
[47:05.320 --> 47:09.320]  that to me it felt good you know why because it
[47:09.320 --> 47:11.880]  made me reflect on everything i've done and you know what
[47:11.880 --> 47:15.800]  it's good it's the truth it's the reality okay
[47:15.800 --> 47:19.560]  i've got the guts to tell the truth not because i'm a tough guy folks but
[47:19.560 --> 47:23.960]  because i've got a fighting instinct and a survival instinct
[47:23.960 --> 47:27.800]  people don't you ever praise me again anybody
[47:27.800 --> 47:35.160]  praise me for what i've done i'm embarrassed when i enjoy food ladies
[47:35.160 --> 47:37.320]  and gentlemen i'm embarrassed when i enjoy anything
[47:37.320 --> 47:40.280]  because i realized just how evil this new world order is and i feel like i
[47:40.280 --> 47:43.400]  should be doing nothing but fighting the globalist but more and more i
[47:43.400 --> 47:47.160]  realize you can't be unbalanced i can't just fight all the time
[47:47.160 --> 47:50.520]  so i'm gonna actually be taking more time off to get myself right with god
[47:50.520 --> 47:53.640]  but i'll tell you something folks you better get your butts right with god
[47:53.640 --> 48:00.360]  right now because this is real ladies and gentlemen
[48:00.360 --> 48:08.120]  this could well be this could well be revelations you understand that
[48:08.120 --> 48:10.680]  and let me tell you all you thumbs suckin fake christians that think you're
[48:10.680 --> 48:14.040]  going to be teleported out of this just watch folks
[48:14.040 --> 48:17.320]  watch and you're going to wish later you stood up and done something and don't
[48:17.320 --> 48:20.440]  give me this well if you know if the world government's foretold
[48:20.440 --> 48:23.000]  my son has read the bible over and over again he's seven years old
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  he reads the king james version and he reads full length novels history books
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.880]  he said to me last night he said but daddy you're not going to beat the new
[48:29.880 --> 48:33.240]  world order he just looked at me so young and
[48:33.240 --> 48:37.320]  handsome and smart and full of life makes me hate the new world order every time
[48:37.320 --> 48:40.200]  i look at him just thinking about how good he is
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.040]  and he said you're not going to beat the new world order because the bible
[48:44.040 --> 48:47.640]  you know the bible says the world government's going to come
[48:47.640 --> 48:50.680]  and i said son it doesn't matter if we beat it or not
[48:50.680 --> 48:55.080]  we've got a responsibility to stand up against it and to warn people about it
[48:55.080 --> 49:00.120]  so they at least spiritually don't fall to it do you understand that
[49:00.120 --> 49:02.600]  let me just tell people something those are the you out there

[49:18.120 --> 49:21.560]  and to be active and to be out there facing down evil
[49:21.560 --> 49:24.680]  with courage it isn't even courage it transcends that
[49:24.680 --> 49:29.480]  you shouldn't be able to control yourself if you don't have that burning

[54:11.800 --> 54:15.080]  looking at that said that both dates were april 20th
[54:15.080 --> 54:18.440]  there is an april 20th there's a whole bunch of dates in the movie
[54:18.440 --> 54:22.040]  but that's not the date with the oil rig thing so i feel a lot better
[54:22.040 --> 54:25.160]  i'm just so sick of them throwing in our face with the hundreds of other cases
[54:25.160 --> 54:28.360]  where they specifically do that but we'll continue to analyze that
[54:28.360 --> 54:33.960]  i'm glad watson is on on the case all right i said i'm going to take calls
[54:33.960 --> 54:36.840]  i've done an okay job of that but i've still failed to
[54:36.840 --> 54:40.040]  to just spend about a minute and a half with each caller
[54:40.040 --> 54:43.480]  uh so we're going to do that now until the bottom of the hour
[54:43.480 --> 54:47.080]  then i'm going to get into the situation with north korea that is very very
[54:47.080 --> 54:50.120]  serious what's happening with the global economy
[54:50.120 --> 54:55.080]  uh it's just a quickening that's happening right now
[54:55.080 --> 54:58.280]  let's go ahead and go back to gary in new orleans gary
[54:58.280 --> 55:01.240]  uh you've just got to point out that the feds are blocking
[55:01.240 --> 55:05.720]  locals for being able to protect their own areas i i've seen the studies that
[55:05.720 --> 55:10.840]  the chemicals bp is using are even more toxic than the oil itself
[55:10.840 --> 55:14.680]  but i don't know what else to say i mean that the federal government cannot and
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.280]  will not help you uh it's it's like the mafia
[55:18.280 --> 55:21.480]  it's like taking a loan from the mafia you get a thousand dollar loan
[55:21.480 --> 55:24.520]  from a loan shark but you're never going to be able to pay it back you pay it
[55:24.520 --> 55:29.400]  back a hundred thousand it won't be paid back uh so i mean what do you say
[55:29.400 --> 55:32.920]  well you were asking where the men are that are ready to stand up with the
[55:32.920 --> 55:36.440]  local people and the fishermen are beginning to mobilize
[55:36.440 --> 55:39.800]  to take matters into their own hands um there's been 40
[55:39.800 --> 55:43.240]  boats commandeered by the jefferson jefferson paris government
[55:43.240 --> 55:46.920]  they're going to begin doing it themselves are we to expect military
[55:46.920 --> 55:50.840]  action by the globalist uh and well that's exciting news i haven't seen
[55:50.840 --> 55:52.760]  that i mean has that come out in the paper
[55:52.760 --> 55:55.960]  uh that the paris is just going to do the job themselves
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.400]  well they're beginning to do that but they've been waiting a month and we just
[55:59.400 --> 56:03.400]  keep getting more and more it's katrina and ultra slow are you hearing stuff
[56:03.400 --> 56:07.640]  about katrina ultra slow motion have you heard about
[56:07.640 --> 56:13.000]  the reporters like cbs and others being told they're not allowed to videotape
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.360]  public beaches alex i'm all over this one okay this
[56:16.360 --> 56:20.920]  was our study 911 jfk this is happening and unfolding the dust hasn't settled
[56:20.920 --> 56:24.440]  yet here now my big question is should we
[56:24.440 --> 56:28.600]  set up a fund to get the money to the paris president so they can
[56:28.600 --> 56:31.480]  undertake this because it seems to be about funding
[56:31.480 --> 56:35.720]  and then there has to be a study by the army corps of engineers before
[56:35.720 --> 56:39.800]  they're going to do anything and that's the federal control look the sheriff
[56:39.800 --> 56:43.240]  can just get together and say all the men that want to help me let's go
[56:43.240 --> 56:46.280]  and they could go out there and do a lot more than the government could ever do i
[56:46.280 --> 56:49.000]  appreciate your call i mean that's what's going to be needed you give a
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.520]  bunch of money the politicians it'll take six months for them to do anything
[56:52.520 --> 56:56.520]  with it and they'll sit around and we're paralyzed by government in this
[56:56.520 --> 57:00.280]  country now julio in illinois you're on the year
[57:00.280 --> 57:05.080]  hey alex i'm pressed for time so i'm gonna quickly go to my point first off
[57:05.080 --> 57:07.960]  the mockingbird media instead of talking about europe
[57:07.960 --> 57:11.880]  on the courage of on the verge of crisis they're talking about
[57:11.880 --> 57:16.120]  uh... lindsay lohan in uh... and court today all three of the mockingbird
[57:16.120 --> 57:19.880]  cable networks immediately went to live coverage on that which is kind of
[57:19.880 --> 57:23.560]  disgusting secondly whoever is a member of the the way
[57:23.560 --> 57:28.600]  matt's report needs to print as many copies as possible
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.920]  send it out to friends send it out to citoro lovers and believers
[57:32.920 --> 57:36.840]  because his special report and what he's been investigating here in chicago
[57:36.840 --> 57:40.040]  is uh... is pretty amazing stuff i heard him on the show
[57:40.040 --> 57:43.240]  the other day and uh... and i'm reading what uh...
[57:43.240 --> 57:47.160]  he's been talking about here and uh... for those in the know in chicago
[57:47.160 --> 57:49.960]  on the north side of town you know about boys town
[57:49.960 --> 57:53.720]  will be kind of shocked when they hear about uh... mister manuel
[57:53.720 --> 57:56.840]  and uh... bear citoro and what they have been doing and
[57:56.840 --> 58:00.040]  i heard your interview with uh... the member of the love police
[58:00.040 --> 58:03.880]  on thursday and i watch their videos on youtube everyone needs to do that because
[58:03.880 --> 58:07.160]  uh... it's it's it's very uh... uplifting
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.400]  and if this is what we need to do who at whoever see itself somewhat above what
[58:11.400 --> 58:15.240]  we are changed us in confronting our political leaders but when we do that
[58:15.240 --> 58:17.960]  i want to do this every time i see someone
[58:17.960 --> 58:21.320]  but let's reveal the fact that they are zionist
[58:21.320 --> 58:25.240]  uh... worshippers to believe in satanic cults and who
[58:25.240 --> 58:29.320]  do these uh... you know homo erotic activities
[58:29.320 --> 58:33.880]  are really over we're out of time you know i just think it plays into the divide
[58:33.880 --> 58:35.000]  and conquer
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.960]  to sit here and talk about one group running the new world order it's it's
[58:37.960 --> 58:42.920]  it's it's it's more of the same

[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:13.400]  and globalists and bring up the fact that they're Zionists. Now, I had the love police on because
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:18.920]  specifically when that political activist group saw some people who were part of the Zionist lobby,
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:25.560]  they yelled that at them. Okay, in England, I'm all for that. I mean, when Israel does something
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:31.720]  wrong or Israel's involved in corruption, every major government is, call out the Zionist mafia,
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.880]  if you would. But there's the Communist Chinese mafia, there's the Dutch mafia, there's the
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:44.280]  British mafia, and they're all intermarried and connected. So people get confused by my stance
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:49.960]  on this. I am for confronting evil mafias. Larry Silverstein's part of a mafia. Clearly,
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:56.600]  so's Mayor Daley. But that doesn't mean I'm against Irish people because I'm against the Irish mafia
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:03.800]  in Chicago. You know, that's like if I'm against the Italian mafia, I'm not against Italians.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.120]  And as long as we approach fighting these mafias from that perspective,
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:12.600]  we can get everybody together to defeat the new world order. You know, it's like the open borders
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.520]  in Latin Americans. Latin Americans are great hardworking, smart people. They've lived under
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.920]  tyranny for hundreds of years. The US was special. We had a little bit of liberty.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.040]  Certainly not perfect, but more than most, we had more private property, so we had all the wealth.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:33.800]  Now we're losing that. And so I want to reach out to Latin Americans and say, why don't you be free
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.280]  market? Why do you go with the big Communist route? You know, supposedly either have an El
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:45.400]  Hefe right wing military junta that runs you or communism. How about be libertarian? How about
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:50.360]  be true private property? Well, they always like the Communist model because the El Hefe's control
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.360]  99% of the property. And so the average person, it sounds good to re-dispersed that wealth.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.480]  And then, you know, there's the dangerous route of, well, how do you take the 99% of the wealth
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.720]  from the thieves? Then what have a lottery where you divide up the land? Or do you nationalize
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.360]  the land and then divide it up equally? See, that's why communism looks good from a, say,
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:17.720]  Latin American perspective, but you never really get communism, do you? No, you never really get
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:25.640]  that land. You just become another form of slave. So what do you do with the people that have never
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:32.840]  had freedom? Most of the world hadn't had freedom, but I'm not here bashing people from Latin America
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:38.360]  because they're Latin American. I'm bashing the system and through the North American Union,
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.280]  they're trying to merge us with that political system. And I'm not going to give up my second
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:49.960]  amendment or private property. No, no, no. I mean, they just arrested the nuclear physicist
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.880]  who'd been in jail for 18 years for admitting that Israel has nukes. Well, they publicly have
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:01.800]  nukes. They've arrested him again. And I saw people in the Jerusalem Post going, oh, he deserves to
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:09.080]  be arrested. You know, for giving out national secrets, national secrets. Israel is saying
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:15.000]  nuke Iran because in the next five years, they might get a primitive a bomb when Israel has high
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.800]  tech intercontinental ballistic missiles and the warheads, the hydrogen bombs to be delivered in
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.520]  those warheads. And then Israel wants to play this game and say they don't have nukes when they
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.920]  publicly have them. And we're giving them to Pakistan and South Africa. What is Israel doing,
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:36.040]  helping give nukes to Pakistan? That's a bunch of lawless thugs that run Israel. That's why.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.240]  Well, then why do they hate Iran so much? Because Iran used to belong to who?
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:53.640]  British petroleum until 53. All right, we're going to come back and go to your phone calls.
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.560]  The more you know, though, the more you know, you don't know. We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:04.440]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap,
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.440]  not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company,
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:13.640]  a family owned and operated American company. My family, staff, friends and radio listeners
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.200]  are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.080]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:44.040]  say. As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me how's business? I'm happy to say
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:53.720]  our business is going down the drain. Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website

[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:06.120]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.680]  losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned. As of January
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:16.200]  1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:21.800]  restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver. We must take immediate
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:26.680]  steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.000]  Action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.680]  home. Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:44.440]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous unpredictable side effects. Go to www.silverlungs.com
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:49.800]  for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own colloidal silver

[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:08.760]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.320]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have outperformed
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.480]  even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.760]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:28.280]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.440]  food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.640]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:43.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:54.120]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:59.160]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:07.640]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.200]  Wickedness in high places throughout history and government.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:29.560]  A hundred to one is run by wicked crooks. It doesn't matter what color religion creed.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:37.000]  Our republic isn't perfect, but it's the best it's ever been, and look at the wealth and power
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.360]  it's created. Now we fall into tyranny. We're now an engine of world government and domination.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:48.040]  If we don't break the spell, shake ourselves loose of the idiot box, and relearn the Bill
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:53.400]  of Rights and Constitution, and take action against the high-tech tyranny, we're going to fall to a
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:09:01.240]  level of despotism and dehumanization never before seen. Now, I'm going to your calls
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:09.480]  in rapid pace. Kathy in Montana. Welcome. Hello, Leah, Alex. I'm glad to hear your voice here.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:14.440]  I just wanted to ask you about, and this falls right in with the guy that just called what he
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:21.240]  was in Louisiana about the oil spill. Yes. About the Costner Ocean Therapy machines. It's really
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.200]  hard to find any information. I have to keep going online. I just found one from Friday
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:34.280]  where they're saying that the hotend that his business partner was saying that they had as
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:41.400]  many as 26 machines dispatched throughout the Gulf, and our largest is 112 inches,
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:49.960]  highways two and a half tons, and cleans 210,000 gallons a day of oily water and spits back out
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:56.040]  99% clean. But they're having now their everybody's drug their feet so much on this stuff that
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:02.920]  everybody is trying to position for where they're going to be put. And they're not even using
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.960]  evidently all the machines that they have available to them. Well, absolutely. Look,
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:14.360]  that oil spill is like 1000 miles long now and growing. It's already caught up in different
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:20.520]  currents. They're not going to be able to clean it up. All they can do is when it comes into shore,
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:26.680]  they should have been setting this up day one with booms, block it from going into the estuaries,
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:32.520]  from going into the brackish water where the fish and birds breed. It's easy to clean it off the
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.280]  beach, but the feds didn't do that. And they knew full well what they were doing. They want
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.880]  a disaster so they can clamp down and other drilling and make us more dependent on foreign oil.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.040]  That's what BP has always promoted. They have the motive to have staged this,
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.480]  that I wasn't sure about it at first, but the way they've lied about how big it is, the way the
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.160]  White House has worked with them, the way this has gone on and on, it stinks to high heaven. Kathy,
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.480]  I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Mike in Kentucky. Mike, you're on the air.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:14.840]  Yes, I have two points. One is I heard today on the power hour that there's lockboxes on the rig
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:21.880]  and that they conveniently don't have any information at the time of the explosion.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:29.160]  And also, I heard last week on the Declare independence with Ars Hancock that there's
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.720]  inspectors on the rig like two hours before the explosion.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.320]  Yes. No, that was in the Associated Press that they had
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:49.560]  Wi-Fi, digital audio, video, data connections to this $150-plus-million rig. And that went
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:55.560]  dead the hours before, and that there were inspectors already dispatched out there for
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:01.640]  some type of emergency problem. And now it's time for Curt and M.O., Paul Watson or Steve Watson
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:08.680]  or Aaron Dykes, one of my great crew, to do a report on this, because now we have enough
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:14.120]  bizarre discrepancies. Now we can see the motive. What do you think of what's happening? Mike,
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:21.400]  I mean, does it stink to high heaven to you? With the piece about the movie Knowing,
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:28.680]  I definitely think it's foul play. I appreciate your call, Mike. But to be specific, the website
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:35.320]  we were reading said that the show said April 20th, and in reality the rig blew up on April 20th.
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:41.880]  It's another date in the film. But again, you have other movies that they've put out where the
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:49.080]  exact thing happens that's in the film, very, very suspicious. But let's continue here with
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.080]  Chris in Kentucky. Another call from Kentucky. Chris, go ahead.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.320]  Hey, Alex. I tell you, I'm just so outraged with these ads about Rand Paul,
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.960]  local, this morning on a radio talk show. They're already demonizing him, and it's not going to
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.280]  work with me, because the radio talk show host, Mandy Connell, said he didn't want to show up
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:14.120]  or be on her program or make appearances. And I just slammed on the brakes, pounded on my dash,
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.760]  and the first thing I did, they're here, they go again. They're so determined to get a neocon back
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.640]  in there. Well, it's not going to work. I've had it. Well, let's be specific. Is this a neocon
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:30.360]  or a fake liberal? What form of parasite operative is it that was attacking Paul?
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:37.480]  Well, I just had turned on the radio at the time, and she was saying that she was talking
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.240]  about Rand Paul not making appearances, and he didn't want to come on my show.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.520]  I know, but is she, what is her political stripe?
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.080]  She's a new radio talk show host, and I think she's actually, she thinks she's so patriotic,
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.880]  but I think she's a neocon under the rug. She's putting on a show.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.560]  Well, yeah. I mean, the Republicans are claiming they want to help Rand Paul. They'd rather have
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:02.600]  a Democrat in there. And I'm going to cover that coming up, but it's a total hoax.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:11.080]  It's just like the headline UK bands doctor who linked autism to vaccine. And I've read what
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:17.400]  the doctor did here in Austin and studies, Andrew Wakefield. He did nothing wrong. His studies are
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:23.080]  mirrored by all the other studies. We know Mercury's linked to neurological disorders. We know their
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:30.120]  way up. We know it's conclusively linked to 18 months old, the third round of shots. His evidence
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.240]  is completely backed up. Meanwhile, we have all these other fake studies put out by big pharma
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.960]  where they've been caught lying. That's not a big issue, but the media runs this hoax that, oh,
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:46.280]  it's all been disproven. Vaccines aren't bad for you. It's all a lie. And it's a hoax.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:51.560]  And we've got Wakefield on tomorrow, by the way. And it's the same thing with Rand Paul. They just
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:15:01.080]  announced, yeah, yeah, he's for the Klan. Yeah, he's against the Civil Rights Act. Never said that.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:07.320]  Never made it a campaign issue. Never called for its repeal. Never discussed it. They know that a
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:15.240]  popular libertarian point is that the Civil Rights Act has gone too far ordering private clubs in
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.120]  lawsuits where white people have demanded to be part of black fraternities or women have demanded
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:25.640]  to be part of the Bohemian Grove male only or reporters, mainly female have demanded to get
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:31.000]  into the master's golf locker room or to get into the NFL locker rooms. You've all seen the suits
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.760]  on the news and he's saying, look, people are allowed to associate with who they want. I mean,
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:45.160]  do you think they're going to have me in a Mecha meeting? Okay. I mean, one time I tried to go
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.600]  to an anti-gun meeting on a synagogue to speak out against it and they saw me there and threw me
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:56.440]  out. Put their hands on me, folks. Now, should I be able to sue and say, I'm allowed to go to your
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:03.000]  meeting, your gun grabbing meeting or your Mecha meeting? No, I shouldn't. I mean, you know what?
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.080]  That's their business. And if the leaders of the church or the synagogue or Mecha or whatever it is,
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.680]  don't want me in there. Listen, if some business didn't want black people in there,
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:19.160]  they're going to lose all that money. There's no way anyone would ever bring that back. It's just a
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:25.560]  ridiculous situation. But because he's honest, he said, I think the civil rights stuff is used too
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:33.080]  far with private clubs. Look, Rand Paul will audit the Fed. Rand Paul will end these wars. Rand Paul
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:39.960]  will reverse anti-second amendment stuff. Rand Paul would not go for Kagan. One senator could
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:48.280]  block her. She says, no free speech, no second amendment. I have her quotes. I mean, it's outrageous.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:53.800]  But no, no. But I like the point he made on ABC News. He said, well, what about Senator Byrd,
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.560]  a member of the Ku Klux Klan? He didn't even say that. He pointed out that he filibustered
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:08.280]  the Civil Rights Act. Oh, but he's a liberal. Oh, look, what did they do with the healthcare
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:13.080]  plan? And they barely got it. If you're against the government running your healthcare and getting
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:19.080]  involved in every fast of your life and garnishing your wages even more, you hate black people.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:26.840]  What does that have to do with black people? Zero, zip, nada, nothing. So they inject it
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:32.920]  into it. You get anti-naft agate groups out there. They have Hal Turner, the FBI agent, run around
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:40.760]  and mixing white supremacy with it to make it look bad. And it's the same thing. But go ahead
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.200]  and finish up your point, Chris. I mean, no, I think Rand Paul is doing the right thing because
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:51.400]  every new interview he does, they're spinning it and lying about what he said. Like they say, oh,
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:58.600]  what do you stand for on the Disabilities Act? And he said, well, I think it shut down a lot of
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.920]  small businesses, a lot of businesses owned by people that are handicapped. They'd like to be able
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:10.040]  to hire people, but they got to put in $100,000 elevator to their two-story house. And people
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:15.480]  should be allowed to make other accommodations. I think there shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all,
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.520]  but I'm not for repealing it. Headlines. He wants to repeal the Disabilities Act. Hey,
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:27.080]  they don't have Disability Act in China. Have you noticed we're falling apart? Have you noticed
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:32.440]  we're deindustrialized? Mexico can't even compete with China and India. It's over, folks. None of
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.480]  you are going to have jobs. You're not even going to fix the highways. We're going to be a giant
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.560]  third-world country once the bankers are done, and then none of you are going to get any of your
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.760]  disability. You're not going to get your Medicare, your Medicare, you're not going to get your Social
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.880]  Security. They're now announcing that. Don't worry. And of course, when they take your Social
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.400]  Security, they've already cut your Medicare and Medicaid by 20-plus percent, there's not going
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:58.280]  to be a big deal made out of that. But lots of hand-ringing and hyperventilating over Rand Paul.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:04.440]  He's going to get you. Anything else, Chris? Yes, very well said. And I also want to say,
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:09.560]  don't support BP. Let's don't support BP. And I also want to make real quick, I was thinking
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.080]  about something. Could you make it a day where we can have people that work for county, government,
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.160]  state, or local have a day to call in to see if they know what's going on with the new world
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:22.200]  or and know what's wrong with government? Could you have a day with that? That's a great idea.
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.200]  Guys, remind me someday this week to do a couple of hours on that. Great points, Chris. I appreciate
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:36.040]  your call. Keith, Joe, Angel Eyes. Angel Eyes. Look at the little Angel Eyes. I bet they don't call

[01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:05.000]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic growth?
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.040]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression. Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We all
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.840]  know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:19.720]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven. But what do you do when the U.S.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:24.600]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors are turning toward
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:30.040]  gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments. Midas Resources has put together
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:34.920]  a powerful book titled Ten Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,

[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:13.320]  Okay, let's go to your calls. Keith in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.440]  Alex, I know I called yesterday, but I had to chime back in about the movie Knowing. The song in
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:25.000]  there, I had talked to you about it before. It's called Beethoven Symphony Number Seven. If people
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.080]  pay attention, that's the song that they play during the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:35.160]  Grove. If you Google search it, you'll learn that there are occult origins to that, that it actually
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:42.280]  goes to worship of the God Dionysus, who has this whole idea of destruction and rebirth,
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:48.120]  great destruction that the elites subscribe to. Yeah, they believe that that's part of nature.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:53.160]  So when they destroy you and kill you, it's beautiful and loving. But then, meanwhile,
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:57.000]  they never want to be destroyed or killed. Now, it's only when they're destroying us
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.520]  that that happens. Anything else? No, I just wanted people to research it. That's what people
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:06.920]  should be paying attention to about this movie, is that song. All right, I appreciate your call.
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:15.640]  We'll look into it. Joe in Wisconsin, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Welcome. Hey,
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:19.160]  forefather of the 21st century, I got a lot of good points I'm going to make to you.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:27.000]  But illegal immigration, and my eyes is a federal offense due to their jumping state line after
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.800]  state line, state line, since they want to interpret the law, they want to, we got to somehow
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.840]  and interpret that right back to a different way. Then on top of that, I was thinking about
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:44.440]  the senators. If we can pack this to where we only have one senator per term and not just 30
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:52.920]  year term stuff where they're making money off of politics too crazy, and maybe we can get
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:26:00.120]  less evil or people in there. Are you there? Yeah, I'm listening to you. And if we can get,
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.160]  and we're talking all 50 states, give them one term so that way we can stop the corruption of,
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.960]  because there's going to be good ones that want to go in there, but they're under so much
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.280]  corruption from the one that stayed there forever, we never get rid of them. So we got to go to,
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.440]  like the president's idea where they have two terms, that's it, one term senators,
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:22.120]  so we can get fresh ideas in. I appreciate your call. It's just under that system,
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:27.880]  we wouldn't have Ron Paul, but I do see your point. They become petty kings and get really
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:33.640]  entrenched up there. But you just saw Specter, you know, term limits for people being voted out,
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:40.040]  and the public's growing up and not being so ignorant. I'm going to cover that coming up in
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:47.640]  the next segment. Let's go ahead and who's up here next, John. Angelize, you're on the air.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:56.040]  Go ahead from Texas. Hello, Alex. Yes. I disagree with you on your 911 road to tyranny video.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:04.040]  You said that the Chandra Levy Congressman Condit was like a smoke screen. Nothing's a smoke screen.
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:12.920]  When there's smoke, there's fire. The week of 911, Chandra Levy's aunt was on with Baba Wawa
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.800]  telling about how that Chandra called her and told her something real big was going to happen
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:25.720]  in America. And she said she couldn't tell her about it. And she said, well, what is it? Well,
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:34.360]  I can't tell you. And then she said, well, it's in Washington, DC, New York, Boston. I think
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.920]  Boston was where most of the planes took off from, where the hijackers were on.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.320]  Did I say something in road to tyranny about Chandra Levy? I don't remember saying anything
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:52.920]  about her. It was the video cassette. It came out like the week after 911.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:58.760]  Oh, you're talking about emergency release. Yeah. I mean, I put out a video just for about a month
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.960]  after while I was making the official road to tyranny, and I may have said something in that.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:10.360]  I vaguely remember that, but I'd love somebody to actually send me the Barbara Walters interview
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:15.160]  or the text of it. You're saying her family said that something big was going to happen in New
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.280]  York and DC. And of course, she was a Congressman's aide that died mysteriously. They later found her
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:25.880]  bones in the park. But I mean, do you have a video clip of that, or did you just remember to say?
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:33.080]  No, sir. I mean, Boba Wawa is not my favorite person. And I got up and walked out of the room,
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:41.240]  and my mother watched it and told me about it. And I just kind of, you know, backburnered it.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:45.880]  And... Hey, somebody email it to us, okay? Showtipsandinfowars.com. We'll
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:51.160]  we'll ferret that out with the great listeners out there. Thank you so much, Angelise.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.760]  Let's talk to Scott in California. Go ahead, Scott.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.560]  Mr. Jones, blessings upon you, your family, and your staff. Keep it going.
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:04.760]  Thank you. It's very... It's so important that you keep this information going out to the public,
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:10.440]  because there are so many people out there who just do not want to believe that their government is
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:17.480]  against them. And they're just... They're so blinded because they don't want to see this. And so...
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:22.200]  And it's also very important, not only that you point out all the things that are being used
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:28.920]  against the American public, but important to give hope by providing solutions on taking back
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.800]  our country non-violently. So, you... So, folks, don't just focus on all the things that are
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:38.200]  happening to you. Go out there and take your country back, and go out there and stand up.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:44.280]  This slave will never seek freedom if he already thinks that he's free. You are not free until
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:49.880]  you take your mind back. Well said. More calls and news straight ahead.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:57.880]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:06.280]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:12.280]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:46.280]  We turn jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.520]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,

[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:11.320]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state
[01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:16.280]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:22.280]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:27.720]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:32.760]  has established an old powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:38.920]  to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:44.760]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:50.280]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming.

[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:10.120]  battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:15.480]  all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:20.760]  ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:25.160]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:29.720]  it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:35.400]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.840]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:46.200]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:55.400]  to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:06.920]  number 1-800-409-5633. He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:15.880]  Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take four or five more calls then I'm gonna start
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:25.240]  getting into the news. The situation with North Korea, you name it.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:33.560]  Before I finish up with some of your calls and the seller will continue in the two hours that
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:40.920]  follow, I know many of you are awake. Most of you understand what's happening globally
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:47.720]  to a level that exceeds my understanding. But your friends, your family, your co-workers,
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:53.560]  your neighbors, your community, they don't know. Yes, they do understand there's a world government
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:58.760]  that's been formed. They know foreign banks are robbing us, but they don't understand the nuts
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:11.160]  and bolts, the mechanics of it. And my films, The Obama Deception and Fall of the Republic, those
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:17.320]  are the two films that I made last year that really break it down the best of any documentaries out
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:22.600]  there. And they're evergreen, meaning you can watch these in five years and they'll be more
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:28.600]  pertinent than they are today. So they only get better with time because people will watch
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.560]  The Obama Deception out 14 months ago and it's all come true. They'll watch Fall of the Republic
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.040]  out six, seven months ago and it's all coming true. And it breaks down who the globalists are,
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:42.600]  how they operate, how to stop them, what their system is. You've got to know your enemy as
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:49.720]  Sung Soo said thousands of years ago in the art of war. And then now our latest documentary,
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:57.880]  Invisible Empire, A New Order Defined, goes over their agenda, their mindset, their crimes,
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.680]  what makes them tech. It's a great two hour, 20 plus minute film with expanded extras.
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.760]  And your purchase of the videos also makes this broadcast possible. They're all available at
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:19.400]  infowars.com on the online video bookstore, infowars.com. You can call toll 38882533139.

[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:58.200]  Ventura on and he was talking about, he just read the secret team republished by Fletcher
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:03.960]  Proudy who died in 2001. They had a black ops between the Pentagon and the CIA. And you know,
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:07.160]  they would always go in and buy up all the books as soon as they hit store shelves.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:12.440]  Then they bought up his publisher to stop it being published. So there's only about 40,000
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:18.200]  copies out there, though it was a best seller. And those have all fallen apart basically. I
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:23.240]  read an old copy a decade ago that literally fell apart as I read it. It's back out in print by
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.880]  Sky Horse Publishing, the folks that published Ventura's book. We've got it discounted at info
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:33.320]  wars.com. This is the book the CIA does not want you to read. I started rereading it last week
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:40.440]  and just finished it this weekend. Couldn't put it down every now and sort of reading it. And of
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:46.440]  course, you think you know it all, but just to read again and how dastardly and how our government
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:53.000]  funded the communists and made deals with them and how it's all staged. And I mean, this guy was
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:01.880]  the head of Black Ops for covert operations. The liaison from the Pentagon to the CIA up until 63.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.840]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble folks. These guys think of us as a bunch of dumb animals,
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:13.240]  and they've decided just to steal everything. And look, I want to say this, it's one thing to
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.880]  have a corrupt government shipping in some drugs and running some whores and killing some people.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:25.800]  That's bad enough, but that's always going to go on. The reason you've got to stop it is because it
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:32.280]  always leads to what we have now, total collapse. Where you greedy people now want everybody's
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:37.560]  pension funds, and you talk about how we're all spoiled and deserve it, and how, you know, ha, ha,
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:43.240]  ha, yeah, we're spiking your water to dumb you down. It's real funny. I mean, it's just,
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:50.360]  it's far beyond evil now. It's to a new level of just darkness. And all right, I'm going to stop
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.040]  babbling. The point is, it's all available. Of course, don't tread on me. It's now available
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:58.360]  at prisonplanet.tv. We were authorized to post it there for members of the highest quality.
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:03.160]  And we're posting Camp FEMA two days from now at prisonplanet.tv, authorized to post that there
[01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:08.120]  for prisonplanet.tv members. Of course, both those DVDs are also available at infowars.com.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:15.480]  But I digress. Let's go to Kathy in Florida. You're on the air, Kathy. Go ahead.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:23.240]  Hi, Alex. I've only called once before. Kudos to your fantastic show and your videos.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:30.120]  Thank you. Last time I called, I gave you my little skit, the idiot pledge. Today,
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:36.360]  I would like to share with everybody the time that it is. It's way past dangerous.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:43.480]  It's so obvious. It's in your face. We are under attack. It's time for all patriots of all stripes
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:48.440]  to circle the wagons and throw the globalists out of this country. And if we do that...
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:53.800]  And be prepared for them to set off nukes and terror attacks and every other form of evil
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:00.280]  to cause crises so they can pose as our saviors. We've got to tell the whole truth
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:07.000]  or we'll fall to their future tricks. Okay. I am aware of their tricks. Reading is what I do.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.440]  I think all patriots should email all of the monopoly media and tell them we are sick of
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:17.960]  hearing about your Hollywood celebrities. Report the real damn news. We're sick of the garbage
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.200]  you're feeding us. We want some real news. Well, I think they know that, Kathy. That's why they're
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:26.600]  all basically on the verge of going bankrupt or have gone bankrupt. But they've still got to continue
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:33.240]  to fire on us from their positions and try to keep that 30-40% of just mindless drones marching
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:39.720]  forward. But they know that the tide has shifted against them. That's why they're all on Facebook,
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:43.560]  sticking their finger up in the air, seeing which way the wind is blowing, and then jumping out,
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:49.160]  pretending like they're leading us. Their actions are so obvious. If you do not see it,
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.800]  you are a sleeper drug, one of the two. I hear you, Kathy. Beautiful points.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.200]  All right. I'm going to go to John and Ohio, and I like calls that disagree, but we don't get a lot
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.600]  of them. We tend to get five or 10 of the same people that call in, and it's going to start with,
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:09.640]  yeah, I really agree with some of the work you do in exposing the fascist corporations and NATO
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:16.040]  and false flag chair and other things like that. But at the same time, you push a lot of CIA propaganda
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:23.000]  about Hugo Chavez being bad and the Communist Chinese being bad. And I just really want to plug
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.280]  these Communist websites now, Alex, and let me give these websites out to you. So, John, there,
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:34.600]  I've said what you always said. If you're going to repeat the same thing, I just don't even need to
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:40.200]  hear it today. John and Ohio, how about you plug in fullwars.com for us today instead of
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:46.760]  WSWS.org, other good websites. I really like them. Do some good work. John, go ahead.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:54.520]  Okay, that was approximate. Not exactly, but I wasn't going to bring that up right now because
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:00.440]  I used to plug in, but I can't anymore because I want to mention something about Rand Paul that
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:08.920]  turns up on InformationClearingHouse.com. And I wanted to point out that he is actually,
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:12.600]  he is going to be on Joseph Lieberman and pushing the neoconsignist line.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:20.280]  He's put out a, to all of his members, his position on Israel. And it's incredible if you'll
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.240]  read this article. It's from the American Spectator, but it was picked up by InformationClearingHouse.
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:32.920]  Stop right there. I've seen it, but let me just tell you this. Why is from and all these other
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:41.080]  APEC lobbyists, why are they all savaging Rand Paul then? Because all he has said is he supports
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:48.120]  Israel's right to exist. And he has said that he's against foreign aid, by the way. And he said that
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:56.280]  if Iran does attack us, we should defend ourselves. And why are the neocons attacking him? Because
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:03.320]  they know he is a patriot. Okay, that's why they don't want him in. That's why the entire media
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:08.520]  is coming down on him with both feet. And you got the neocons and the controlled left all attacking
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:15.480]  him. Doesn't that tell you that Rand Paul's a good guy? It may not be their favorite neocon,
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:20.520]  but it's incredible the amount of things. And your generalization of what he said is absolutely
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:27.000]  not true. He's called for the attacks against Iran. He is set up by the attacks and might watch the
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:34.520]  attacks on the people in Gaza in this article, to all of his supporters. People have to read this
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:39.640]  because this could have been written by Joseph Lieberman. I mean, the idea that you're going
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:47.160]  to support the government that is probably the most dangerous bullet point for dragging us into
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:53.480]  a war against Iran, Israel, whether they're the tag, the dog wagging the tail or otherwise,
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:43:01.160]  they are the leading spear for today. Listen, use your head, John. The entire media establishment
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:09.480]  is demonizing him as if he is Adolf Hitler incarnate. Okay, use your brain. I have read
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:17.080]  what he said. He has said that Israel has a right to defend itself and he has said that
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:25.160]  if Iraq ever, if Iran ever attacks us that he will be for defending ourselves. He was on Fox
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.440]  News last week and wouldn't say he was for attacking Iran and they criticized him for it.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:37.640]  Look, I'm not forever playing politics and if I ever see Rand Paul flip-flop, I'll come out against
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:43.960]  him. I've not seen him flip-flop. He is more hawkish than his father by a million miles.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:52.440]  Okay, Ron Paul is, I mean, I'm telling you, you just can't improve on him and he never waivers.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:59.400]  Now, Rand Paul is not perfect, but there's no way he's going to get elected to the Senate. Do I have
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:04.520]  to spell it out for you here? There's no way he's going to get elected to the Senate unless he makes
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:11.000]  some hawking, squawking noises. What's the noise that a hawk makes? In fact, pull up a sound effect
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.880]  of a hawk. Let's pull up a hawk screech for people. So what? And again, there's no way he's getting
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:28.040]  elected in hawkish Kentucky without, and I believe it's what he really means. I mean, I believe that
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.360]  he is for defending the United States, but he's going to cut the defense budget. He's going to
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:36.680]  shut down a bunch of bases. So I don't think you're listening fully to what he has to say there,
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:42.600]  John. I don't think you're giving the accurate quotation. Okay, read me the quotes. Read me the
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:50.200]  quotes. Well, I'll give you some quotes. Okay. Finally, thankfully, Israel is one of the bravest
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:55.240]  elite military forces in the world. I believe that the United States should increase the pressure
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:01.960]  on Iran. I would mandate that all public management funds divest from Iran immediately. What is going
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.160]  on here when Israel that is threatening these countries of the Middle East dragging us into
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:13.480]  World War III? Now, if you would read the full text of what he says, he is actually going beyond
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:18.920]  the neocons, whether they want him in as their favorite neoconor or whatever. Hold on. I think
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:27.240]  I hear Rand Paul. Hold on. I think you're right, John. Hold on. Is that him? Look, they're all
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:32.840]  in panic mode about him and they say he's lying to get into office. I don't think that's what he's
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:38.920]  doing, but I'm confident he's the man for the job. Why do you think the entire establishment,
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:46.040]  see John, this is where you got a real blind spot here, pal. You know, you like Hugo Chavez because
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:51.000]  the corporate media is attacking him and I'll agree. He did kill the summit of the Americas,
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.880]  the expansion of the NAU and the Central and South America. And so he's not perfect, but he is a
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:07.160]  sandal in their works. He is sabotaging the larger NAU, you know, spreading into the
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:14.760]  larger Americas. So why then is Chavez good because the corporate media is after him?
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:20.280]  But now Rand Paul is bad, even though the media is having conniption fits over him.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:27.080]  Well, I'm saying that Chavez is not calling for allowing Israel at the time that they're
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:30.520]  threatening to attack the World War III. I'm against an attack on Rand Paul. I'm against World
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:37.160]  War III. So is Ron Paul. Ron Paul has called sanctions an act of war against Iran and a
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:43.720]  legal act of war. And I agree with him. And I really think you need to reexamine why the neocons
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:48.600]  are hyperventilating and attacking Rand Paul from every angle. I just, you know,
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.800]  I've read the quotes you're talking about and it's, I mean, read that quote again.
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:00.120]  He's against government sanctions that are an act of war. And he thinks that if private U.S.
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:05.240]  corporations want to put sanctions on them, that's their business. Let me make a point
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:10.680]  about this. Ron Paul is different on this issue than Rand Paul. And you know that because you've
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:15.800]  read this, that's what I just said. And then the point I'm making is that Rand Paul is supporting
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:20.520]  the threatened war, nuclear war, even by Israel against Iran, which will drag us into World
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:27.160]  War III. Now that is completely off the charts. He is pushing. Read me a quote or he supports nuclear
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:34.680]  war. He's supporting giving Israel the opera, giving Israel the total freedom to do what it's
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.000]  calling for right now to attack Iran anytime they want. Read me that quote. Well, that is the U.S.
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:47.400]  government policy. Read me that quote again. I'm trying to look at it here, but if you said
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:51.080]  you've read it, you realize that he's... No, I read that article. It was about a week old,
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:57.000]  but I didn't. What's the name of the article again? I'm going to pull it up. All right. It's
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  called Rand Paul and Israel Tea Party candidates are owned by Israel. It's from an earlier American
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.480]  spectator, which is not any kind of a liberal magazine. And he calls for allowing at the time
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:16.360]  that they're threatening to attack Iran as the leading spear for dragging us into World War III.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:20.760]  He's saying we shouldn't criticize them for doing this in the context of what they're doing right
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:26.280]  now. He is... I know, but John, John, John, John, you just gave me their headline. What is the
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:34.680]  American spectator headline? I'm not sure. I would imagine they'd be jumping up and down for
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:41.560]  Glee, the American spectator, over this talk. But I want to see the quote because that is
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:47.720]  disturbing, you know, saying, you know, Israel, you go ahead and nuke them. I would imagine,
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:51.480]  he said, we're going to cut off foreign aid to everybody. And what sovereign countries do is
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:55.880]  what sovereign countries do, knowing that Israel is not going to attack without U.S. backing.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.840]  Support it. Anything that Israel wants to do in the context of attacking
[01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:07.080]  any country that he calls a threat to Israel. I mean, that is exactly supporting the incredible
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.840]  inflammatory... Is that a quote? That's a very close paraphrase of what he said.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.800]  I want to see the quote. Listen, send it to showtipsandinfowars.com right now.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.760]  John, and I want to read that quote for myself because that is disturbing.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:32.680]  John, I don't want to read a paraphrase, John. I don't have it in front of me at the moment,
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:36.920]  but what I'm saying is that he's calling for giving total aid to Israel at a time when
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:43.000]  they're threatening a nuclear war and giving total sanction against Iran and allowing Israel
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.280]  to do what it wants because we are such a close and brotherly ally of Israel. That sounds like
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:53.080]  Joseph Lieberman. And if you're talking about Shabbat, if you want to talk about a...
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:58.680]  Well, hold on. Let's go back to the other issue here before you digress into your Lord.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.880]  John, I'm trying to understand here. These don't sound like quotes you're reading. I've never seen
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:11.640]  these quotes. Not the place of outsiders, he says, to meddle or pass judgment or use our power
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:17.640]  to force Israel to go into her own interest. And then he talks about that in the context of their
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:27.000]  possible attack on Iran. And then he demonizes Iran as the problem in the Middle East. Exactly
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.160]  this is the kinds of propaganda we're getting out of Neocons and Joseph Lieberman. And it's
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.920]  distinguished from Ron Paul, at least on the war issues and the police state issues. I agree with
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.720]  him. But he comes down on the side of the Wall Street banks with his libertarianism of slashing
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:44.200]  and gutting all social programs, which is exactly the IMF and World Bank and Wall Street interest.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:51.960]  I at least agree with his father on that issue. But Ron Paul, in this excruble position paper,
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:57.480]  is a total Zionist. And I think that's got to be realized. Whether they're their favorite...
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:15.240]  Okay, hey, hey, you had your time. I got the article.

[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:20.520]  Look, I'm very loyal to Ron Paul. And I agree with him on every subject. And I like Rand. He's
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:25.160]  been on the show. He does want to audit the Fed. He does want to kick the New World Order out.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:32.120]  And he said, look, Israel, you want to attack a country? Go ahead and do it. And that's the
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:36.360]  extreme paraphrase. I mean, I know he said, look, countries can do what they want, but he does want
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:43.000]  to cut foreign aid. And all I know is the whole media is piling in and attacking him. And I'm
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.920]  going to support Rand Paul. And if I start seeing him flip-flop if he gets into the Senate
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:57.400]  on any promises he's made, including promises he's made me personally, I am going to go absolutely
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:06.680]  ape. Know that. And believe me, I'm going to get attacked. Just like when Deborah Medina flip-flopped.
[01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:11.800]  9-11 truth is healthy and good. It's a wonderful thing. Those towers fell in a strange way.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:18.440]  She was saying that after the Glenn Beck thing. And then a week later,
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:23.800]  started saying, yes, I agree. Their total scum is despicable. That's why I got mad at her.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.680]  Not that she didn't agree with 9-11 truth, as the straw man put out, knowing full well what
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:33.960]  they did. But that's why they're losers. And, you know, they're not us. But I'm sad for Deborah
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.720]  Medina. You know, she didn't ever even give a concession speech when she lost. Never even
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.360]  updated her website. It was like, I'm not going to be able to support her in any future endeavors
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.320]  because of the dirty tricks I saw out of her campaign. I'll just be honest with you. I haven't
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:49.720]  even talked about this on air. I mean, this is a whole thing as a dirty business, ladies and
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:57.320]  gentlemen. And I know Ron Paul's for real and is awesome. And I know the neocons believe that
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:03.800]  Rand Paul is playing possum on the military issue. I don't think he is. I mean, I think he's more
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:10.280]  hawkish than his father. And I believe that, you know, he really does support Israel's right
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:15.800]  if they want to go attack Iran to go ahead and try it and to keep the United States out of it.
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:20.360]  And you notice these are also campaign text that are being circulated because I do,
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:27.080]  I do have the material now here in front of me. It's Rand Paul and Israel. If I have time later,
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:30.760]  I'm going to get into it. But listen, listen, here's the deal. I've opened the phones up today
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:34.440]  and I've already gotten deep into the show without really plowing into news. I want to get into the
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.680]  North Korea situation, what's happening in the world, why all these crises are kicking in right
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:44.040]  now. I want to get into the economy. I want to, there's just so much. I want to get into the
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:48.520]  political realignment that's happened, where the world is going. It all ties together at the eight
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:53.960]  after I'm done with calls, at least till about 40 into the next hour. This segment, the next,
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:59.480]  your phone calls right now. We just blew like 10 minutes with John, but he did have some serious
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:05.000]  points. Let's go ahead and talk to another John. John in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:11.320]  Alex. Yes, sir. Can you hear me? Yes, I do. Okay. A couple of months ago, I was
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.800]  linked onto a blog site or a website that had a Chinese news program and they were covering
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:23.560]  the joint Chinese Russian maneuvers in China. Yeah. And when it was over with, they had this
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.480]  great big huge formation, thousands of them. They had this Chinese general standing up in front of
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.640]  them talking, but all they talked about was they were peacekeepers and they were going up
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:36.360]  peacekeeping missions and they're training for peacekeeping operations. And I was wondering
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:41.080]  how these people are going, how they're going to fit into any kind of a military operation against
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:45.000]  Korea. If they're going to be against it, which they probably will be, but I'm going to cover that
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:51.320]  today after, but you, I always love the synchronicity or serendipity. Either way, you slice it
[01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:57.320]  of callers calling in about subjects I plan to cover. Not just peacekeeping on the Korean
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:02.840]  peninsula. And we know that war was staged. In fact, guys, will you get me the secret team book?
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:11.800]  Thank you. It's in the back by Fletcher Prowdy. It's not, listen, this is not my opinion. I would
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:17.000]  laugh at patriots 15 years ago saying they're planning to use foreign trips in America until
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:22.760]  I went to drills and witnessed the role players with foreign troops practicing for the U.S.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:30.040]  U.S. Now we have NLEO 9, NLEO 10 documents. We have the West Point statements. They really
[01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:37.160]  are planning to use Chinese, European Union, NATO, German, Israeli, French, Australian
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:44.200]  troops in America. Stay there. Stay there. America's number one stories for independent

[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:19.080]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now live from
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:27.560]  Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Yeah, the Shanghai Cooperative Organization between Russia and China
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:38.360]  is openly drilling to go into southern and northern Korea. The whole world is gearing up for
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:42.600]  fireworks on every front. It's all happening now, just like in the lead-up to World War
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:48.520]  I and World War II. And it's not just Alex Jones saying this. Any geopolitical strategist
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:01:02.360]  who's worth 10 cents of salt can tell that we better buckle up. Buckle up because you ain't seen
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:09.720]  nothing yet. The world is going into controlled orchestrated chaos. But John in Texas, I think
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:16.120]  you answered your question with the statement you made. Yes, they're gearing up for what appears to be
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:21.640]  an engineered regional conflict but done in multiple regions of the planet engineered
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:28.600]  controlled World War III to bring in the global government. I was in the infantry in Vietnam in
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:33.560]  1970. And we were fighting the Chinese by proxy. We were killing Chinese advisors that were leading
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:39.400]  NBA patrols when I was over there. And I think they wanted to engineer the destruction of our
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:46.520]  firebase, firebase ripcord. It was totally annihilated. And you see how they behaved in
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:51.400]  the Korean War. They burned our prisoners of war alive. And the trolls on the reservoir,
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:56.440]  they overran medical teams and burned all the prisoners alive. And they backed the Kymer Rouge.
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:02.520]  And you see how they treated their people at Tiananmen Square. I mean, if they were to
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:09.400]  ever get into this country or whatever, I know how they'd behave. Oh, this country's for sale.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:15.080]  The globalist 30 years ago had made the decision to have Europe be their new western command base,
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:20.600]  but their eastern command base is China. And according to the globalist, and you now see
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:25.560]  that in the headlines, America is gone. You won't recognize America. They're letting you know.
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:29.880]  We raped you. We stole everything. Now we're going to totally get rid of you.
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:36.440]  And it's just, and you know, the average cop says, I don't care if I'm going down with the ship,
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  at least I get to boss some slaves. And so we're just going to sink unless we wake up to how
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.800]  pathetic we are and admit we're slaves. And only by admitting how pathetic we are,
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:53.720]  can we ever get our past freedom and glory back. But no, China is the model. It's the Chinese
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:59.000]  century. That means the Chinese people, but it means that their slave masters, because they've
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:04.840]  got the best slave system have been chosen as the apple of the new world orders. I appreciate your
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:11.960]  call, John. Let's talk to Matt and Indiana. You're on the air. Mr. Jones. Hey, buddy. I think it's
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:17.240]  no coincidence leading up to the oil rig thing. We had all those coal mine disasters. And I think
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:25.000]  it's almost a silver bullet, but to decriminalize and legalize hemp would reindustrialize our
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:32.120]  nation and quickly and people in prison. I mean, it really would because it's better than cotton.
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:38.600]  It's better than polyester. It's a miracle product. But you know what, people'd rather have asbestos
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.880]  in their house and they'd rather have polyester and they'd rather have petrochemicals. So you
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:49.880]  know what, again, just George Washington grew it and the constitution's written on it, but it's
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:56.120]  evil. Okay. And I'd like to give a little rundown of the police state city that I live in Evansville,
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:02.600]  Indiana, home of the Liberty dollar. Since 94, the general TC was military recruiting in the schools,
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:08.760]  cameras on the buses. Indiana has a secure ID. We got two chains of gas stations here,
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:13.240]  scanning IDs for cigarettes. We got facial recognition cameras at the airport and the
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:19.080]  license branches. I've always found Indiana is top of the food chain in police state.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:24.120]  Every time evil pops up, it's Indiana. And it's the Indiana's got great folks. Going back over
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:29.800]  20 years, they did an analysis and found that Indiana was just full of great people just like
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:36.600]  Idaho or Utah or Texas. Wherever they know there's good Americans, they move the grid in.
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:41.800]  We have an Indiana Department of Homeland Security Mobile Command Center parked on a
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.920]  street here in Evansville, Indiana. Making sure the slaves, your milk cows, man. When they're
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:51.720]  done using you up for milk, they're going to slit your throat. And they've got devil dog
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:57.160]  troops ready to kill you and ask for seconds. It's good to butcher America.
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:06.280]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order, a new world order
[02:05:06.280 --> 02:05:11.800]  based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalist through
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:16.680]  their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:22.200]  world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:28.120]  over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:33.160]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:38.280]  world government. I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:42.840]  the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:48.520]  to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:10.280]  draw their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:15.320]  a constitution which protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a
[02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:19.640]  sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water,
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:26.200]  children, our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:31.160]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising. You have been warned.
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:34.920]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:39.560]  law. Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:44.600]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic. Terranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that

[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:41.080]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:47.800]  Samuil Casting, the syndicated radio broadcast at prisonplanet.tv. Thank you for joining us.
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:52.920]  I'm going to cover a bunch of news right now until later in the hour, then we'll open the phones back
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:09:02.440]  up at 1-800-259-9231 for everyone that is patiently holding around the country and the world who is
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:09.560]  tuned in. Okay, before I get into the political realignment happening here in the United States
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:14.520]  and in other parts of the globe, before I get into the economy, I want to cover North Korea,
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:23.080]  because it all integrates together. It was Lenin, Vladimir Lenin, who said that there are times
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:29.000]  in history when more happens in a week that happened in a year and when more happens in a
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:36.360]  year that happened in the previous hundred years. And we are definitely in that time frame right
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:46.040]  now, but because of the convergence of technological developments, population, communication and high
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:55.080]  powered military hardware and other factors all combining together now, you're not going to see
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:10:03.640]  a decade of rapid change and accelerated change by orders of magnitude. You're going to see from
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:15.240]  here on out a quickening with all of the benefits and dangers of high technology, life extension.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:22.680]  The issue is, though, the ruling global elite from their own statements and white papers,
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:31.000]  the ruling global elite that are in control of society right now have disdain for the general
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.200]  public. They think of you as scum and trash. They don't even want to dumb you down or enslave you
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:42.280]  further. They want to set up a global police state so they can then exterminate you. And this is
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:47.240]  their stated goal. We've covered it at Nausium with my film, In Game, Blueprint for Global
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:53.160]  Enslavement, and other documentaries. And we've read their publications and quotes here on air
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:58.280]  over and over and over again. And so if you're a new viewer or listener and you're laughing about
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:06.840]  this, you'd better do a little research. Say it, whatistheingame.com or ingamethemovie.com
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:13.960]  and read the full bibliography for the two-and-a-half-hour film and check all the facts and
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:19.320]  claims for yourself. You might want to read Ecoscience written by the White House, Science are
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:26.600]  1,100 pages. You might want to read the 900 pages of Tragedy and Hope. You might want to read
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:34.600]  The Secret Team by Colonel L. Fletcher Prowdy. Now back in print, by the way, available at info
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:42.360]  wars.com. Of course, Ecoscience and Tragedy and Hope are written by top globalists from their
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:48.680]  perspective of how they've got to have a planetary dictatorship to then kill you to do it as humanely
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:54.520]  as possible, sterilize you with the fluoride, but that's not enough. You can read the head
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:12:00.280]  Pentagon liaison and they don't deny this. It's on record between the Pentagon and Black Ops,
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:09.880]  Bay of Pigs, you name it, where he details everything that Joseph McCarthy said was true,
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:17.960]  everything and more. Of course, the Russians in the last decade have declassified their
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:22.520]  McCarthy files and you've seen the headline of the New York Times, McCarthy was right,
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:29.320]  but now it's quaint and funny. Kind of like a decade ago, Times Sure Flies, I was watching
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:38.120]  History Channel and they had the 90 plus year old former CIA section chief on from 1949 who was over
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:47.320]  China and also into China, not just China proper, but also over Vietnam and he bragged and said,
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:52.920]  yes, we put Mao Zedong in power. We didn't like Shanghai check, but we couldn't tell the public
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:59.640]  that at the time because communism was unpopular. Now, I literally almost fell out of my chair,
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:06.600]  just like when I heard BBC admit our government grows and ships out the opium out of Afghanistan
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:12.200]  last year. I almost ran off the road listening to XM because I already knew this, but to hear
[02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:20.360]  them, to hear Kermit Roosevelt six, seven years ago on NPR, it was a tape after he died. He died
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:27.720]  in 99, CIA commander, 53 was Swartzkov's daddy overthrowing Iran, bragging that they staged
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:34.680]  terror attacks and use radical Muslims to overthrow Mohammed Mosadak. Again, I already know all of
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:42.920]  this, but to hear them brag about it, knowing that the public so dumbed down and so pathetic
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:49.080]  that they can now have Geraldo Rivera go on Fox and talk to Marine Corps commanders with the troops
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:53.800]  gathered around going, you're growing the opium here. Tell us why. Well, we have to grow it or
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:57.640]  Al Qaeda will get it. So we got to help the farmers grow it and ship it out.
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:06.920]  We don't cover conspiracy theories here on this show, ladies and gentlemen, 99% of the time.
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:11.320]  We get into numerology and the occult and how the leader obsessed with it. Yes,
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.760]  but only because that's what they're into. It's all conspiracy, no theory.
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:22.920]  But reading, rereading the secret team, because Jesse Ventura recommended I reread it. He had
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:28.760]  just read it and was blown away by it. Paradigm shifting for him. And I told Ventura off air,
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:33.800]  I said, now you got to read tragedy and hope. You know, don't just read somebody on the inside who
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:46.440]  was against it. Read somebody from the inside who was for it. But what does this have to do with
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:55.960]  North Korea? Everything. There were several meetings with Roosevelt and Churchill
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:10.280]  that they had at the end of World War Two. And then after Roosevelt died, meetings with Stalin
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:18.680]  and, of course, Harry Truman. And those were public meetings that they announced each time
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:25.080]  months after it had happened. And he talks about in there how the Soviets who'd been our
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:29.720]  ally during World War Two, the West said, how do we set up a police state domestically?
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:37.240]  How do you set up a police state? You need an enemy. And they said, well, we'll demonize you.
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:44.360]  You demonize us. We'll cover your atrocities. You'll cover ours. And then we'll have proxy
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:49.080]  wars with each other. So we don't ever have to nuke each other. And we'll take half of a country,
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:52.760]  and you take the other half. You take half of Korea. We take the other half, half of Vietnam,
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:57.320]  the other half. We take half of Europe, which they divided Germany in half, of course, and
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:04.120]  took over half of Eastern Europe. We'll divide it all in half with you. And that would, at first,
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:09.480]  was even public. And it was all staged, every stinking benefit. Oh, it's not staged when you're
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:20.120]  in a foxhole, you know, fighting communist. But it's staged when you're in the upper command
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:27.560]  and you're not allowed to bomb actual factories in the north. And, of course, it got declassified
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:31.960]  two weeks ago that the U.S. wanted to nuke China with Russia. In fact, reprint me that
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:40.120]  London Guardian article. The headline was Russia wanted to nuke China. And then you read that,
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:45.560]  well, the U.S. two years before it wanted to nuke them as part of their deal with the communist,
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:52.280]  because China wasn't following their agreements that had been made when the U.S. put Mao into power.
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:59.480]  So there is some infighting going on from time to time. There's no honor among thieves with these
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:05.000]  people. So they're always double-checking each other. It's like the final round of risk or
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:11.160]  multi-dimensional, multi-level chess. They're not just playing with two colors, okay? It's more
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:19.880]  like five or six big factions with sub-factions all in there cheating each other. Now, what did
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:24.840]  McCarthy said? McCarthy had said there were communists everywhere taking over America. Look at us 50
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:31.000]  years later. Big government runs everything. They tell you what size your lightbulb can be,
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.520]  what type of toilet you can have, where your kids can, you know, just everything's been controlled
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:40.840]  down. But it's communism by the banks. They take your money and then give it to themselves through
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:46.680]  the government. But as soon as Joseph McCarthy, and if you understand this, you understand everything,
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:54.840]  as soon as Joseph McCarthy realized and went public and said, I've discovered the communist
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:18:02.760]  conspiracy is run by the Pentagon. And they said, excuse me, you're saying that the commies in Russia
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:08.280]  have infiltrated the Pentagon. And he said, no. I mean, go read his speeches. He said, no, the
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:15.800]  Pentagon is the communist. That's who runs the whole thing. Well, who had set up the UN in 45?
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:21.240]  Who had set up the tank and tractor factories with General Motors and Ford?
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:30.280]  Who gave Russia the weapons and the oil and the raw materials to then ship it to North Korea and
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:39.400]  ship it to Northern Vietnam and to ship it into Cuba? Because again, the U.S. gets to take part
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:44.840]  of a country. Again, it goes back to World War II. What did Hitler do? He made a secret deal
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:52.840]  with Stalin. This is now declassified in public. The Nazis slash Soviet Pact, they made a deal
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:57.080]  to where Hitler said he was protecting Poland from the Russians and the Russians were protecting
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:05.080]  the other part of Poland from the Nazis. And so they came in and divided the country of Poland.
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:08.200]  I mean, if you want to defeat the New World Order, folks, you've got to understand their
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:16.920]  master strategic planning and why they're so hard to beat and stop thinking black versus white,
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:24.360]  Christian versus Muslim, you know, two-dimensional game of checkers. This is chess, but at multi-level.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:29.800]  It's like playing 10 chess games at once, folks, with millions of different factors coming in.
[02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:39.720]  And so as soon as McCarthy realized that the communist conspiracy was run by Wall Street,
[02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:45.560]  he was no longer useful. Oh, he was very useful letting the feds take over Hollywood
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:50.360]  and create a right-wing backlash that they could push a police state with as part of this
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:56.520]  dialectic. But as soon as he figured out the real takeover, he was out of there in a New York
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:04.120]  minute. We'll be right back. Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:08.840]  storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:13.400]  real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.080]  seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that
[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:21.480]  could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:27.720]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:32.440]  supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:37.240]  have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:43.960]  acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com,
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:55.160]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis,
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:21:14.200]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:31.480]  world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:36.360]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe, first of all, that we
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:41.160]  now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance

[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:05.080]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic growth?
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:10.120]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression. Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources. We all
[02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:14.920]  know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:19.800]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven. But what do you do when the U.S.
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:25.000]  government overextends itself and spends beyond its means? Many investors are turning toward gold
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.800]  as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments. Midas Resources has put
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:35.000]  together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,

[02:23:04.920 --> 02:23:13.240]  down home value made in the USA blue jeans, like you wore as a kid. Remember? There's a place down
[02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:26.040]  here where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch. Guarantee you love
[02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:34.920]  the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond
[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:41.720]  gussets got it. Others don't. For good old fashioned comfort, get diamond gusset jeans.
[02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:46.520]  Every stitch guaranteed. In our Defender motorcycle gene comes Kevlar reinforced.
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:59.080]  See them at gusset.com or call 888-848-7738. That's 888-848-7738. Diamond gusset jeans got it. Others don't.
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:08.440]  Okay, so that was quite a bit of preface in the last segment before I get into North Korea.
[02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:18.760]  Fast forwarding to 1995-96, the head of ABB, the Swiss nuclear power plant company,
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:26.600]  is Donald Rumsfeld, a key gopher for the globalist. I mean, he's the guy that gets DU approved for
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:32.680]  our troops to use. He's the guy that gets Aspartame approved. He's the guy that gets Prozac approved.
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:40.760]  I mean, he is the key man on so many levels. He gets, what was it, sex? We can pull up the
[02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:46.360]  article. In fact, just I don't want to go off memory. Google nuclear reactors to North Korea,
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:54.200]  Donald Rumsfeld, ABB. But multiple reactors are sent and they're the type that you can actually
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:25:01.480]  create A-bombs with the material. And the media was like, why, why did the Swiss sell them this?
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:08.360]  Why did the U.S. government stand by? Why did our government and Israel help on record give
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:15.080]  AQCon laboratories from the late 80s through the mid 90s the components to not just make hydrogen
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:20.680]  bombs or A-bombs, but to have medium range and long range delivery system. There it is.
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:25.800]  There's ABB's website. ABB to deliver systems equipped to North Korea nuclear plants.
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:32.440]  There's their press release. Good job, guys. Donald Rumsfeld ran that. And he's always the head
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:38.440]  of the company for like six months. You'll step in and get Aspartame approved. Chemical weapon
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:45.080]  feces from bacteria. You can't make this stuff up. He'll step in and get Prozac approved as the
[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:49.800]  head of the company. He'll step in and get Terminator seeds approved. He'll step in and get
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:55.960]  the bio weapons of Saddam in 84. He'll, he'll step in and get the reactors transferred.
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:05.720]  Brzezinski's a similar high level globalist. So is Kissinger. But the issue here is,
[02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:12.920]  I mean, in fact, here's another headline today dealing with Israel.
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:27.320]  London Guardian giving nukes to South Africa. Why? Why was Israel involved with the U.S.
[02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:32.200]  and England creating the Mujahideen to fight the Russians? They've always run these Muslim extremists.
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:38.760]  And again, you'll have the top terror controllers who are Muslim leaders,
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:45.240]  who are global, double and triple agents who literally have Muslim extremists working for them,
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:49.480]  who really think they're fighting for Allah outdoing this. So, so the guy they bust in the
[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:54.520]  street, he's a real Muslim terrorist. But he doesn't know he's working for Mossad
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:00.680]  or MI six. In fact, I've got another stack of mainstream articles here today.
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:10.440]  A headline terror inquest may probe MI five role BBC MI five faces probe over July seven bombings.
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:16.120]  MI five faces probe over 77 and their role in it.
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:21.960]  How long have we told you that that's an inside job and the families have demanded
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:26.840]  this investigation on the cover up and you go to the evidence the government ran those attacks
[02:27:26.840 --> 02:27:32.120]  on seven seven and had some idiots. They'd hired to take part in a drill who they blew up.
[02:27:32.120 --> 02:27:36.200]  One guy got away. So they shot him up a canary wharf. That was on the news.
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:45.720]  But I'm digressing. Here it is. London Telegraph USSR planned nuclear attack on China
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:52.520]  and 69 but buried in the declassification from the Chinese and Russian archives is that the U.S.
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:58.120]  had had a secret deal with the Russians against China and was and that Nixon was mad
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:08.200]  that two years before Russia hadn't agreed to launch a sneak attack on China when they wanted to.
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:16.200]  And so by then Nixon already made a deal with China to manage to menace Russia.
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:21.320]  So this this back and forth is always going on behind the scenes. But it is on record now
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:27.800]  that our government put Mao Zedong in who killed between 64 and 82 million people.
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.240]  The Chinese government says 82 million. Our government says 84 million.
[02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:35.080]  Whatever after 84 million who's counting. Well each one's a human being.
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:40.600]  How many sports stadiums filled with 100,000 people is that to give you an image of the
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:45.880]  humanity disappearing. And David Rockefeller writing books about how great Mao is and
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:50.120]  editorials in the New York Times praising communism. Why would one of the richest men in
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.880]  the world be praising communism. Well read a stinking column. He tells you why.
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:29:02.600]  Okay I'm going to settle down. The issue is with all of that backdrop and our government
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:10.440]  helping transfer nuclear weapons, fissile material to North Korea. Why would our government do that?
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:15.560]  Because they don't want Japan and South Korea living in peace.
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:23.160]  Because they won't need our bases there if they're not being menaced from the north.
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:32.360]  Japan won't need our bases if the North Korean dictator every year so isn't shooting ICBMs over
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:37.880]  their country that land a few miles off their coast threatening to nuke them. We'll explain this
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:41.880]  when we come back then get into the political realignment worldwide. A bunch of economic news
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:46.520]  is smattering of other key info and then your phone calls and a guest coming up. But this is
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:54.360]  important so I'm going over the backstory first. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.240 --> 02:30:03.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite
[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:08.360]  are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that
[02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:13.400]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds
[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:17.160]  have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:21.960]  happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:28.040]  non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:32.600]  nutrient dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:37.800]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis
[02:30:37.800 --> 02:30:44.600]  garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call

[02:30:56.520 --> 02:31:02.760]  barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com. Hello this is Alex Jones with some
[02:31:02.760 --> 02:31:07.640]  important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm
[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:12.920]  how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:18.040]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you
[02:31:18.040 --> 02:31:23.000]  want it? Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.960]  identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine
[02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:32.760]  and you can't feed yourself will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out
[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:38.440]  all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom
[02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:43.480]  and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.

[02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:04.760]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:32:04.760 --> 02:32:08.840]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:12.520]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true,
[02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:16.200]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:20.600]  could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the

[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:23.880]  So it's outrageous about all this is. They know you're naive, but not just naive.
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:28.760]  Gullible. You don't want to believe the government's growing the opium and the cocaine,
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:33.800]  the coca, and controlling who can ship it in. You don't want to believe Dinecore has been caught
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:38.280]  in Halliburton running giant child kidnapping rings. Even when it comes out in the Houston
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:44.440]  Chronicle and the Chicago Tribune, nobody gets in trouble. You don't want to believe that the
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:49.800]  government funded the communist and Hitler before that, even though it's declassified in public.
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:55.320]  But you don't want to believe that our government put the North Koreans in power
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:02.280]  and put Ho Chi Minh, who was admittedly OSS in power and worked with the OSS during World War
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:09.960]  II. You don't want to admit it because it's so diabolical, but it's all on record. And now,
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:14.840]  because the information age, they go, okay, yeah, we put the Commies in power. Yeah, we're growing
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:20.680]  opium. Yeah, we've got CIA aircraft. We fly people out that are to be tortured. We fly cocaine in,
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:24.440]  and they have congressional hearings, you know, the CIA solicitor general saying,
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:28.520]  we did bring all the cocaine and we did do it, but we're sorry now.
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:34.680]  And so, of course, they're in the news saying they're getting ready to take more of your pension
[02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:39.320]  funds. Of course, they're going to come out and say, we want to put lithium in the water to make
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:43.560]  you behave yourself on Fox News. They're just going to come right out and say, you're not
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:49.720]  going to admit you're in a nightmare. See, see, once you buy into corruption and rationalize it
[02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:55.240]  by increments, pretty soon those increments add up to really big things you're accepting.
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:04.680]  Of course, 9-11 is staged. Of course. I mean, what idiot looks at the facts and doesn't know it.
[02:35:05.880 --> 02:35:09.880]  Not just the evidence. Look at how within 15 minutes of the attack happening.
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.720]  This is a new world order. Everything's changed. We've got to attack Iraq. We've got to take
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:18.760]  all your rights away and blah, blah, blah. The same talking points everywhere.
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:28.760]  And then it goes on and on how the U.S. troops were already massed to invade the month before.
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:32.760]  Bush had already signed the launch order. They announced building 7 had fallen exactly how it
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:43.720]  did fall right before it fell. On and on and on. None of us are safe while this continues.
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.520]  You know how bold these people are? They could have killed Kennedy who had health problems with
[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:54.920]  poison in his drink. They could have killed, you know, any of these people. No, they wanted to
[02:35:54.920 --> 02:36:00.920]  blow his head off in plain view of hundreds of people and dozens of police with everyone seeing
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:06.840]  the men behind the, the, the grassy and old firing. They did that as a public execution
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:12.120]  at high noon to let you know we run things now. Look.
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:21.320]  At the end of World War II, 22,000, this is on record. So don't live in denial.
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:29.080]  22,000 U.S. troops had been captured in German camps by the Russians and the Russians just
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:35.560]  kept them as slave labor and intel. And our government didn't want to have a PR problem.
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:43.880]  They just said keep them. 22,000 troops don't mean Jack Diddley squat. Now, if 22,000 troops
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:49.640]  don't mean Jack Diddley squat for the people that ran our government in 1945, who do you
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:54.760]  think's running things now? Because the way corruption works is it always gets worse
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:37:01.640]  till it's brought fully to heel. What do you think's going to happen, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:09.480]  Do you think any of you are safe? See, that's the big mind trick. That's the big game.
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:17.240]  Is that people think they're safe by cowering and by going along with corruption. They think
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:21.640]  the safe path is not speaking up, not popping your head up above, you know, the grass,
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:28.520]  the grass just going along to get along. When you have a nation of castrated,
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:34.360]  gilded, dumb men, because they're more than just cowards, they're dumb.
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:40.520]  Because only a fool thinks you give into corruption and you somehow get ahead.
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:48.760]  No, you become a slave and your children become a slave and you lose your hopes and
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:53.160]  your dreams and your future. And I've said this many times, I'll say it again, you're only alive
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:38:01.480]  once, folks. Now is only now and the crossroads were it. Going into the future, you're not going
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:05.240]  to be able to make the right decision later. You're not going to be able to turn back and wish
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:10.200]  that when the Republic was on its knees, but still had a fighting chance of getting on its feet.
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:15.160]  If we can just get the country on its feet and right now it's trying to get up, sleeping giants
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:23.160]  awake and it hadn't walked in decades and it's trying to get up, trying to get out there
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:30.840]  in therapy and take a few steps and every one of us have to give our blood, our sweat, our tears,
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:37.960]  our soul, our spirit, our very energy. If I give your soul to it, commit to liberty and freedom.
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:41.640]  Give your soul to God. If you give your soul to God, you're not going to be able to control
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:45.400]  yourself. All of you out there think you're Christian or think you're on the side of the light.
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:51.560]  Look, if you're not fighting evil, come on. Faith without works is dead.
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:57.000]  I'm not afraid of dying. I'm not afraid of being destroyed. I'm not afraid of being demonized.
[02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:01.000]  I'm not afraid of being tortured. I'm not afraid of the maker stuff up about me in the media
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:06.840]  coming out and saying, Lord knows what. I'm only afraid of failing.
[02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:14.520]  That's why a lot of days I hate myself because I'll be watching a previous show and I'll think,
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:19.720]  God, I should have explained that better. I said that date wrong. Whatever. It doesn't matter.
[02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:24.840]  We can't get caught up in the fact that we're not perfect and we don't have all the answers.
[02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:29.080]  We know the globalists are consciously against free humanity and must be dealt with.
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:35.960]  And you notice that everything's quickening. Everything's getting more accelerated.
[02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:40.200]  Everything's getting more intense by the millisecond. And that's because everything
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:48.200]  is starting to come to a head right now. Just like before World War One and World War Two,
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:54.040]  which we now know were orchestrated by the British Empire and the modern British Empire
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:01.880]  is the Anglo-American New World Order slash, you know, Israeli power arm. It's all merged.
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:07.000]  One big group. And you can't say which head of the hydra runs the hydra because it's all part of
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:12.040]  the same creature. One head of the hydra is just as guilty as the other head of the hydra.
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:20.440]  And the hydra will destroy people who aren't good. It'll destroy people who are good.
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:25.400]  The point is it's the big hydra. It's the big dragon. It's the big monster.
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:31.640]  But it'll, it'll saddle up beside some other petty tyranny and say,
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:36.840]  look, I'm better than that tyranny. Join me, the dragon. That's its trick to the point of it
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:47.160]  created the Nazis. It created the Soviets. It created all of these enemies so it could
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:52.680]  diminish you with those enemies so it could have its war. I mean, it goes back to the Rothschilds
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:59.000]  and others funding both sides of any war. That way they always win.
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:11.800]  And then it's elementary to understand that Kim Jong-il is a peonapod with the Rockefellers
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:16.600]  and the Rothschilds and the Dutch royalty and the British royalty and these elites.
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:21.000]  He wears a jumpsuit. He's got cameras watching people. He's got slave camps.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.880]  He's what the globalists want. They let men and women together one day a year to breed.
[02:41:25.880 --> 02:41:29.160]  They take the babies away the way you take eggs away from a chicken.
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:33.800]  There's no such thing as family there. They are the model.
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:39.880]  And that's why our government gave them weapons systems and that's why our government gave them
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:48.440]  nukes and because they like them. The globalists don't like Iran. They're pro-family and they
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:55.400]  got their own problems. But they're pro-family. They're pro-sovereignty. They're pro-free market
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:42:01.560]  and they hate the new world order, folks. You know, you don't have people taking people's
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:07.720]  kids and raising them in government brainwashing camps. They've got their own form of tribal
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:12.840]  brainwashing but everybody does. I mean, the issue is we know why they're going up against Iran,
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:18.280]  okay? Because once they've got that country, they've got from Turkey all the way to Pakistan,
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:22.200]  they've got that whole area controlled to continue their operations.
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:30.120]  And so now, notice as the world goes into financial collapse,
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:38.120]  as we go into this crisis and the government starts demonizing domestic groups ahead of
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:45.240]  stage terror attacks here to be blamed on us, simultaneously North Korea launches torpedo
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:53.720]  attacks on ships, international waters, starts threatening to attack the South, that forces
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:57.800]  the South Korean government that had been talking about making U.S. forces go home,
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:04.200]  suddenly have to talk about war. They never had a peace treaty. There's just been a ceasefire for
[02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:13.160]  50 plus years. And we are now right up to the point of open World War III starting with Iran,
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:23.640]  with North Korea, with Pakistan who has nukes, and you look at all three cases, Pakistan given nukes
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:34.200]  by the West, North Korea given nukes by the West, Iran not given nukes by the West. Nowhere near to
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:41.000]  getting a nuke. They're being picked off because they don't have nukes and because they have not
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:48.600]  been chosen to menace their neighbors, because Iran hasn't made a deal with the globalist.
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:55.080]  And if you go back and really study the history, not only did the Persians,
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:01.560]  with under Mohammed Mosaddek, who was secular, kick out the Muslim extremists the British and
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:07.160]  CIA had brought in, but he was going to use the oil money for the Iranian people to become a
[02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:12.920]  First World nation. Now, once he got kicked out, the Shah started double crossing them,
[02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:18.920]  as Tarpoli talked about in the late 70s. So they planned to bring in their CIA-controlled
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:25.560]  Ayatollahomanian into the country. And that's why they had arms for hostages, deals, and all
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:30.840]  that stuff you saw. And then they double crossed the West again. It's on record they brought the
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:36.840]  Ayatollahomanian. It's on record they supported him. This is how this stuff works. And in hindsight,
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:42.600]  it's all on record. So that's why they hate Iran so much is they've double crossed them repeatedly.
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:49.880]  And so we've said over and over again that globalists have to have a war.
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:55.240]  They are politically in so much trouble now. The only way they're going to kick start
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:02.840]  their global government and their banking takeover is to create crises that make us as humans
[02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:10.120]  gather around. You go back 3,000 years ago, let's say where Berlin is today in Germanium,
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:16.040]  and you may not like, you know, your, your chief Harathgar or whatever his name is
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:20.280]  or your chief Alaric, what, you know, whatever
[02:45:20.280 --> 02:45:30.280]  Vandal or Visigoth name he's got, and he may do bad things to you. But when the
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:39.080]  neighboring tribe comes pouring up over the hill and across the across the valley and starts coming
[02:45:39.080 --> 02:45:44.120]  across the river, you're going to forget how much you don't like Rathgar and you're going to mount
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:49.160]  up and get ready for war to defend your family. And it's the same thing they understand human
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:58.520]  psychology as much of a civilization as we've built. We are still just tribal creatures and the
[02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:05.240]  globalists understand psychology and they know how to manipulate us and they understand these tricks.
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:12.520]  And so if you've just won World War Two with the Soviets and the Soviets are fully U.S. funded
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:17.800]  on record in 1970, funded by the U.S. and British government on record to overthrow the
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:25.320]  Azarb, what are you going to do? You've just divided Europe up with the Soviets
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:30.360]  and you go, how do we invade more countries? This is great. How do we now have an empire?
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:34.120]  Well, we act like we're opposing each other and we have proxy wars all over the planet.
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:38.760]  You take half, we take half. That's what me and Hitler did, Stalin said. This is on record now.
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:45.400]  Yeah, we'll do that. Sounds great. And if our government would just ride off 22,000 U.S.
[02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:50.040]  troops because it was easy, or would just openly talk about committing half of Europe
[02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:54.520]  over to Soviet tyranny, the Soviets had already killed at least 40 million people up until that
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:47:00.840]  time, your life means nothing here in America. The only issue is you have a history of guns,
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:04.280]  a history of the Second Amendment. And that's why they said, well, we've launched this Soviet
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:09.400]  takeover operation worldwide. What are we going to do? The American people have got all these guns.
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:13.640]  Well, they'll give up most of their rights in the name of fighting communist. While we incrementally
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:19.080]  set up well three distribution and get them domesticated, later, this is all in the Rand
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:25.960]  Corporation documents, Club of Rome documents, CFR documents, you know, the merger. We had
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:30.440]  Bilderberg group documents, what the Tucker got a year and a half before the Berlin Wall was brought
[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:38.600]  down. That was all staged. And they said that we'll get them to give their rights up the name
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:44.680]  of fighting communist. But then at the key point, we'll say communism doesn't exist when we actually
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:48.840]  set up communism here domestically, and we're just going to merge all these countries together.
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:55.960]  Then we'll use the US, Europe, and China to mop up the rest of the planet. But things don't always
[02:47:55.960 --> 02:48:02.600]  go the way the New World Order wants. The Russians are as crooked as a barrel of snakes, but they're
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:10.440]  old corruption, old evil. And they want to survive. They have a Russian identity. They still have a
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:16.200]  culture. They're paying their people for over a decade to have babies, because they've lost over
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:21.400]  30 million of their people through eugenics. They're openly talking about the New World Order,
[02:48:21.400 --> 02:48:27.320]  and they want their own system. And if you look at the splits, and Brzezinski talks about this,
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:35.080]  China is more allied with Europe and the US. Russia is that wild card, and it's still engaged with
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:39.400]  the globalist. It's still interfacing. But going back over the last decade,
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:44.440]  Vladimir Putin arrested all the oligarchs. Every time they got arrested, it turned out they were
[02:48:44.440 --> 02:48:51.880]  CIA fronts or Rothschild fronts. That was in the news. He would seize a company, and it would turn
[02:48:51.880 --> 02:48:57.000]  out, oh, it doesn't matter. The assets are already in Europe. They're already in England. And so those
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:01.960]  are all the different power blocks out there. And there may be a deal later with the Russians to
[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:09.960]  double cross China again. I mean, there's no honor amongst these people. And so now we stand at the
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:15.880]  precipice. The US military told, get ready in Korean standoff. Obama orders commanders to prepare,
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:21.400]  to deter further aggression with military operations. South Korea threatens war. If
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:27.000]  North Korea makes one more provocation, they've said if you enter our territorial waters,
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:33.160]  our airspace or territory, we will respond militarily. So this could start any time.
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:39.160]  And notice, right as the banks are in trouble, right as the global government is being formed,
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:46.200]  right as they're out in the open, suddenly we've got to attack Iran, suddenly North Korea is out
[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:52.760]  there engaging provocations and publicly stating provocations. I mean, this isn't a false flag,
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:56.440]  all the evidence shows on North Korea, because this is their posture. This is what they want.
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:09.400]  And there's no doubt Kim Jong-il is liaisoning through the Chinese, and this is all a rigged game.
[02:50:09.400 --> 02:50:16.360]  This is all a ruse to threaten South Korea, to keep US forces there, and they may even have a
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:25.480]  military exchange. The war may start again. And you know, there won't be an instant decapitation.
[02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:30.760]  They've done the analysis. They know the North Koreans want to get out of the slavery.
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:34.040]  No, there won't be a new king of the capital. There won't be
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:41.480]  a wiping out of the troops on the front lines. No, they'll just keep them there, because they
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:47.320]  like North Korea. They like how Kim Jong-il gets things done. They like people being total demonized
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:53.080]  slaves. People running our government liked killing 22,000 of our own vets. They hate you.
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:57.480]  They hate America. They hate freedom. They want to make you domesticated animals.
[02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:00.680]  So they're getting ready to really stage some big events.

[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:49.640]  the Air Force. Very important book. Available at infowars.com. Now back in print. Invisible Empire
[02:54:49.640 --> 02:54:55.160]  new order defined. And of course, don't tread on me dealing with a way to take the country back
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:55:01.320]  at the state level. Okay, I meant to get into the massive political awakening and realignment
[02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:07.560]  that's happened. And that's why the globalists have to launch World War III. That's why they've
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:14.280]  got to start giant crises. Because Merkel has lost the parliamentary elections. They have those in
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:20.280]  phases in Germany. So next time there's an election, she's going to be out of office. Sarkozy lost
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:27.240]  his parliamentary elections is barely hanging on. Gordon Brown lost and is now gone. A new puppet's
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:37.880]  in Hawaii, the first Republican elected to the Congress. In 20 plus years in Obama's district.
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:45.880]  You see the Kennedy seat being lost in Massachusetts. You see Rand Paul trouncing the
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:53.400]  neocon candidate in Kentucky. You see the same thing with an anti-establishment Democrat
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:58.600]  beating specter in the primary. Same thing. Anti-establishment Democrat coming from nowhere,
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:06.360]  trouncing the establishment Democrat in Colorado over the weekend. People's
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:12.760]  just go in and say, okay, who's the media telling me I should vote for? I'm going to vote for the
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:21.080]  opposite person. And that really threatens the system that threatens the shadow government
[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:25.720]  because they got a bunch of puppets in Congress. They'll do whatever they're told. So all over the
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:32.680]  world, people are resisting these governments that have become vassals or tools or or or
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:39.880]  minions of the offshore banks. What did Brzezinski talk about last week to the CFR? For the first
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:46.040]  time in history, the entire world is awake to our world government. We have never been in a crisis
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:51.640]  this great. They are fully aware of us and our operations. This makes it very hard for us to
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:57.960]  continue the expansion of global governance. That's basically what he says.
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:07.080]  And so what do they do? They don't play games. I mean, they grow opium and
[02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:12.200]  ship it into the country publicly. They ship the cocaine and publicly they don't care.
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:19.080]  Shut up. So some of you know we bring it in. You pathetic scum. Soon we have world government
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:25.720]  in place. We eliminate you all. I mean, I mean, these guys are very, they love it. They love to
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:33.800]  get up and publicly tell us what they're going to do to us. Yeah. They enjoy it.
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:42.360]  Well, I think more of people. I think we're men. I think we're going to wake up to all their tricks
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:48.280]  in their games. Yeah, we weren't paying attention before, but we are now. And so I'm going to tell
[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:59.160]  you right now, folks, since the end of the official war with North Korea, we've never been in more
[02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:07.080]  danger on the peninsula. And we've never had a bigger danger with Iran or stage terror attacks.
[02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:11.080]  You know, the globalists are going to start wars and stage terror attacks to go after all their
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:21.000]  enemies. And you see all the preconditioning leading up to domestic terror attacks. Pro
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:25.880]  gun groups are working with Al Qaeda. I know. Isn't that horrible? Those darn gun owners working
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:30.600]  with Al Qaeda. We better get rid of the second amendment. Yeah, I'm not about to let Al Qaeda do
[02:58:30.600 --> 02:58:38.200]  that to me. Yeah, those darn ranchers and farmers won't give their land up. They're American Al Qaeda
[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:48.440]  too. We got to stop them. Yeah. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today.
[02:58:52.680 --> 02:58:56.680]  Hi, folks, this is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:58:56.680 --> 02:59:01.640]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[02:59:01.640 --> 02:59:07.080]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system is the first
[02:59:07.080 --> 02:59:12.280]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the
[02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:18.120]  respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:23.480]  silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening
[02:59:23.480 --> 02:59:29.320]  the sale of nano silver products. You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with
[02:59:29.320 --> 02:59:34.760]  the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided, making
[02:59:34.760 --> 02:59:41.960]  production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough

[02:59:46.840 --> 02:59:59.240]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:59:59.240 --> 03:00:18.760]  All right, we're back live. We're now into hour number four. We have a guest coming up.
[03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:28.040]  I will intersperse some financial news and some treason news coming up during this interview.
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:34.280]  Very important treason news coming up, but right now let's jam a few more phone calls in here.
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:39.560]  Up next is Michael in Colorado. Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:50.600]  Hey Alex. Yes sir. To do with what you were saying like how they put things in front of
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:57.400]  our face before they execute the attack. Like last year I was watching Discovery and it was
[03:00:57.400 --> 03:01:02.680]  a show about like ice ages, right? So they get to this thing where they have all these scientists
[03:01:02.680 --> 03:01:06.840]  talking about the ice age and how they're actually talking about how there's an ice age
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:11.800]  coming instead of global warming, but that's not the point. They're working on these satellites,
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:17.320]  right? With these reflectors and they were saying that with like four or five of these
[03:01:17.320 --> 03:01:24.440]  lights pointed at one spot on the ocean, they would be able to raise the global temperature
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:30.440]  enough to to battle this ice age or whatever. And but what they would need to do is have an
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:37.240]  oil slick on the ocean surface in order to bounce this ray into our atmosphere to bring up the
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:45.480]  temperature. Well I know this. Now that you in is saying they're worried about global freezing
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:49.560]  and we're supposed to forget about all their fake global warming and they're teaching
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:55.560]  school kids we must stabilize the climate. The climate is always unstable. I mean they're even
[03:01:55.560 --> 03:02:00.600]  trying to blame volcanoes on global warming now. I mean I joked about that a few weeks ago about
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:08.040]  the Iceland volcano. They're now in the news saying oh yes, thawing glaciers reduced pressure on the
[03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:14.440]  volcano. That has nothing to do with it. And by the way glaciers worldwide in the last three years
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:20.840]  have been getting bigger. So I mean they say the Haitian earthquake was caused by global warming.
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:28.120]  They say the Chilean earthquake was caused by it. And because they know the public is kind of halfway
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:33.160]  paying attention. And oh you better pay Al Gore. But meanwhile Al Gore says he believes that the
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:37.320]  sea levels are going to rise in the next 10 years and fought all the major cities. He's bought two
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:45.080]  mansions on waterfront property. It's just made up fraud. He got this big demonic, fat, lying
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:49.960]  piece of trash that told us Naftan and Gatt was going to be the greatest things in slide's bread.
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:57.160]  And then he's up there saying pay him money and he will save you from raising water.
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:03:02.360]  I mean he's literally just a complete joke. I appreciate your call. Again how did Naftan and
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:07.160]  Gatt turn out for you folks? Well remember he was the one pushing that. He was the big spearhead
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:13.400]  on that. He loves conning people. He enjoys robbing you. Al Gore is a piece of trash.
[03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:18.360]  Chris in Boston, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey Alex, how you doing man? Good. All right.
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:22.600]  Good. I hope you hear the word thank you enough every day, every week because it's certainly
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:25.880]  doing a lot for our country. Well I appreciate you buddy. I'm just trying to save my family.
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:32.040]  Go ahead. Me too. I have a 10 year old son so I hear that. But I'm a musician, actually a
[03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:36.760]  conservative libertarian musician living in Boston. So you can see how that works out for me here
[03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:42.920]  in liberal Boston. But actually Bob Chapman sent you a song that I wrote called Freedom.
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:46.440]  I was on a radio program with him. I'm not sure if you heard the song at all.
[03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:53.800]  You know it does ring a bell. I mean I've heard so much good music. I'll have to go pull it up.
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:58.360]  Is it on YouTube? Yeah it's on YouTube and if you can look up I think April 28th,
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:03.160]  Bob sent you the email at the YouTube link. But I wanted to, you know, just if you ever want to
[03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:07.880]  use that song for any movies for your charge, I just want to be part of the cause and you know.
[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:12.680]  What's the name of this song on YouTube? It's called Freedom. Probably a lot of
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:17.320]  stuff under Freedom. Yeah just yeah, look up Chris Ross, Freedom. Okay good, we'll check it out.
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:22.040]  By the way, I looked up American Spectator and I had the quote. I'm not sure if anyone.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:28.200]  What by Rand Paul? Yeah. Yeah, give us the quote. He basically just said as a United
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:33.880]  States Senator, I would never vote to condemn Israel for defending herself and that's it. Well
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:41.560]  yeah and I mean if Israel gets attacked then they have a right to defend themselves. So how is that?
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:47.320]  You've got the left media, you've got the right wing media, they're all establishment incumbents
[03:04:47.320 --> 03:04:52.440]  attacking Rand Paul. What does that tell you about him? I mean when you've got the entire
[03:04:52.440 --> 03:04:58.040]  fake political spectrum attacking him, you know he's good. We'll be right back, stay with us.
[03:05:00.840 --> 03:05:05.080]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap,
[03:05:05.080 --> 03:05:09.080]  not detergents but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company,
[03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:14.280]  a family owned and operated American company. My family, staff, friends and radio listeners
[03:05:14.280 --> 03:05:18.840]  are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:23.720]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:20.760]  most impressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a

[03:07:21.480 --> 03:07:27.960]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:37.320]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it.

[03:07:58.120 --> 03:07:59.000]  Others don't.
[03:08:02.840 --> 03:08:09.400]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.400 --> 03:08:15.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Christopher C. Horner is our guest for the
[03:08:15.960 --> 03:08:21.640]  rest of the hour. He serves as a senior fellow at CEI competitive enterprise institute. He's an
[03:08:21.640 --> 03:08:27.400]  attorney in Washington, D.C. Horner is represented at CEI as well as scientist and members of the
[03:08:27.400 --> 03:08:31.720]  U.S. House and Senate on matters of environmental policy in the federal courts, including the
[03:08:31.720 --> 03:08:36.600]  Supreme Court. He has written on numerous topics and publications ranging from law reviews to
[03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:42.600]  legal and industrial trade journals to print and online opinion pages. And as the author of the
[03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:48.120]  two bestselling books, Red Hot Lies. How global warming alarmists use threats, fraud and deception
[03:08:48.120 --> 03:08:54.520]  to keep you misinformed. Greenpeace has repeatedly targeted Mr. Horner by stealing his garbage on
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:09:00.200]  a weekly basis, issuing press releases, announcing with whom he dines and including him in various
[03:09:00.200 --> 03:09:04.520]  other hysterical publications. Of course, they're funded by big central banks. They have a fleet
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:10.440]  bigger than major government's fleets. They want your property. They want to guilt you into handing
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:20.360]  everything over to the elite. And his new book is Power Grab, How Obama's Green Police, Green
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:25.800]  Policies Will Steal Your Freedom in Bankrupt America. Again, new book Power Grab, How Obama's
[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:32.040]  Green Policies Will Steal Your Freedom in Bankrupt America. And folks, my issue here is
[03:09:32.040 --> 03:09:38.040]  rhetoric cannot describe how bad they are. I mean, you watch Audi commercials like Green Police.
[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:42.360]  That's actually what they're doing in Europe and what they have planned here. This has nothing to
[03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:48.360]  do with the environment. It's a bunch of control freaks running your life, controlling every facet
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:56.040]  of it. They know global warming's a fraud. They've already moved on to other scare mongering. And
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:01.400]  they're not going to stop. And they said even if the Senate won't pass this legislation, they don't
[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:07.160]  care. They're going to have the executive branch implemented. So if they are successful, it's over.
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:14.120]  And look at how they cowed and beat Republicans into submission, because this is what the
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:19.480]  establishment wants. Look at how BP's been one of their biggest funders of global carbon taxes,
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:25.480]  a new derivative scam. So Christopher C. Horner, author of Power Grab that just came out,
[03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:30.760]  cei.org is the website. It's good to have you here with us, sir.
[03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:36.440]  Thank you, Alex. So much is going on. Let's get into, since we had you on two or three months ago,
[03:10:36.440 --> 03:10:41.160]  what's happened with the Power Grab, the fake environmental movement,
[03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:49.240]  and what new heads the Hydra has sprout, and where all this is going.
[03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:57.320]  Okay. So about 11 months ago, the House passed this cap and trade bill. It was about 1,300 pages
[03:10:57.320 --> 03:11:04.040]  long. And they obviously did not read the bill. They snuck in 300 more pages of buying votes
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:09.880]  at 3 a.m. the night of the morning of the vote. And folks declared it dead in the Senate.
[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:14.520]  And then something strange happened. People did get upset, and they had recently been talking
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:18.520]  about drill here, drill now, and we're sitting on the world's largest energy reserves. And
[03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:24.200]  the real national security issue is refusing to tap your domestic energy resources. We won't pass
[03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:29.160]  an energy rationing scheme, right? Well, about two and a half weeks ago, three weeks ago, Harry
[03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:35.560]  Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, openly said to Washington Papers Politico and I think the Hill
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:41.720]  that he was going to suspend the committee process in the Senate in order to cramp cap and trade down,
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:46.680]  but they decided they wouldn't call it cap and trade. Reid said, several people said things
[03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:50.360]  that are very important. There are four people, Harry Reid, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, and
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:56.280]  Lindy Grant. Harry Reid said, well, this would entail the jurisdiction of almost every Senate
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:12:01.000]  committee. Now pause and stop, why? Because it impacts almost every aspect of your life,
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:05.480]  including the Senate Finance Committee, which writes tax law. It's the biggest tax increase in
[03:12:05.480 --> 03:12:10.040]  our history and so on. Reid said, therefore, obviously the four deers would just get confused,
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:14.600]  he's going to write the bill. And he began bringing in constituencies, and that means not your
[03:12:14.600 --> 03:12:21.080]  listeners, by the way, it means even the chamber and API and green pressure groups. And he asked
[03:12:21.080 --> 03:12:26.920]  them, what do you need in order to support this bill? And he asked the chamber of commerce and
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:31.800]  the American Petroleum Institute, what do you need to not run those television ads? Because
[03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:37.000]  both groups raised a lot of money to run ads, educating voters on this energy tax. On last,
[03:12:37.800 --> 03:12:42.280]  it gave them what they want. And so far, it appears they probably got what they want,
[03:12:42.280 --> 03:12:48.680]  which is essentially a gas tax on top of the light switch tax to give, to funnel money to projects.
[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:52.760]  And now they're claiming, I've heard them on the news, oh, there's a new bill in the Senate
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:58.520]  to fund the cleanup in the Gulf. How convenient that, that this BP spill happened when they're
[03:12:58.520 --> 03:13:03.640]  one of the biggest pushers of the carbon tax. And how convenient they wouldn't put the booms in
[03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:09.080]  early in Louisiana and Mississippi and Florida and are letting the oil come in. Oh, I'm afraid
[03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:15.000]  they have to have their taxes now. Let me tell you something. I was in the room with BP. I sat in
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:21.160]  for a gentleman named Ken Lay 13 years ago this month. I was, as I've discussed with you very
[03:13:21.160 --> 03:13:26.920]  briefly, I was the director of federal government relations for a company called Enron. And my number
[03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:31.160]  one priority I was told after I took the job was to get a global warming treaty and a domestic
[03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:36.440]  cap and trade scheme. And the company they developed it with was BP and they had set up this market
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:41.080]  with Goldman Sachs. Oh, this does fit very conveniently. Look, I understand how it fits
[03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:45.640]  into the narrative today, but you have to understand, I was the crazy guy on the street corner muttering
[03:13:45.640 --> 03:13:51.240]  about this for about six years before anybody. Oh, wait a second. I got it. It's called rent
[03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:55.480]  seeking. These businesses trying to make money the old fashioned way by having their buddies in
[03:13:55.480 --> 03:14:00.280]  government agree to take some of their power and return for guaranteed opposition to competition
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:05.560]  and a wealth transfer from you and me to them. So they bought all these uneconomic industries
[03:14:05.560 --> 03:14:10.200]  like Enron had the world's largest windmill company they bought on the cheap. It's now called GE
[03:14:10.200 --> 03:14:15.640]  Wind. Well, I mean, here's an example. BP will pay a billion dollar fine. They've already made that
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:21.480]  in increased oil prices. And then now they'll get more liability protection from government.
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:26.840]  Their competition won't be able to drill in the Gulf. It's just like FEMA got more power
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:31.720]  by screwing up what happened in Katrina. Well, I'll tell you this, it's pretty clear that it,
[03:14:31.720 --> 03:14:35.960]  well, it's in the public record that the green groups actually with whom I met, by the way,
[03:14:35.960 --> 03:14:40.200]  that same day in the same room, there were groups like Union of Concerned Scientists and
[03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:44.600]  National Resources Defense Council, they were Baptist and bootlegger coalitions. The green
[03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:52.360]  groups after the BP, after the well exploded, the green groups were shrieking to the White House,
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:57.400]  don't you dare burn that oil off. And they screamed about consequences of burning, igniting
[03:14:57.400 --> 03:15:03.000]  the oil before it got too well mixed. Well, as I said, actually on a TV show, I think that night
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:08.200]  or within a few days, you have to understand something. I could be as irresponsible as a lot
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:15.480]  of people were about Bush and just say, look, the administration, which by the way was BP's
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:20.760]  favorite political candidate over 20 years, and you know, the administration was just taking orders
[03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:24.760]  from his green group buddies and they want this to be as bad as it can possibly be because
[03:15:24.760 --> 03:15:30.040]  the damage while real is temporary. The tragedy was the 11 men who lost their lives,
[03:15:30.040 --> 03:15:34.280]  but this is a White House that says never let a good crisis go to waste. They even
[03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:39.000]  engineer crises like claiming a global catastrophe from global warming. And the greens,
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:43.960]  of course, have never made money hand over fist like they have. And for those that don't know,
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:47.880]  and for those that don't know, if they would have ignited this within hours, there would be
[03:15:47.880 --> 03:15:53.240]  almost a zero problem, almost all of it would have burned off at the source, carbon dioxide
[03:15:53.240 --> 03:15:58.360]  would have been put into the atmosphere much smaller than a volcano would have literally
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:03.800]  had almost no effect if they would have done what the old timers did and set that sucker
[03:16:03.800 --> 03:16:10.440]  on fire until they figured out a plan to cap it. And now we know why 35 days later,
[03:16:10.440 --> 03:16:15.560]  the White House has done everything they can to block this because now they're going to get their
[03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:21.560]  carbon taxes that Paul Volcker demands we must have to pay Goldman Sachs their bonuses.
[03:16:21.560 --> 03:16:27.000]  Now they're going to get it. Let me tell you, okay, so we know what BP actually did engineer
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:31.080]  this, and the greens are biting them as you knew they would. BP and Enron were in on this
[03:16:31.080 --> 03:16:34.680]  from the beginning again. I was in the room, there's no point denying it. The Greens did tell
[03:16:34.680 --> 03:16:38.040]  the White House don't burn it off. We just know the White House said don't burn it off.
[03:16:38.040 --> 03:16:41.800]  It probably is a co-incidence and they weren't taking their marching orders from the Greens.
[03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:47.240]  But we know BP has been pushing an agenda that John Kerry said, even after the spill,
[03:16:47.240 --> 03:16:53.000]  ironically, he said, I've been working with these companies, BP and Shell, to write this law.
[03:16:53.560 --> 03:16:58.040]  He said this, it's again in the public domain. So, Harry Reid said I'm going to suspend the
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:02.280]  committee process like with healthcare. John Kerry said, I'm not going to call this bill
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:07.000]  cap and trade because I don't know what cap and trade means. If he does, and it has cap and trade
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:12.760]  in it, he just said it's mean if you call it that because of course, there's a memo I talk about
[03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:17.480]  in PowerGraph written by Stanley Greenberg who was Bill Clinton's pollster. He conducted some
[03:17:17.480 --> 03:17:22.920]  polling and he said to his clients who are democratic politicians, you have to do two things,
[03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:27.640]  stop saying cap and trade and global warming and start calling it something else and then it might
[03:17:27.640 --> 03:17:31.000]  work. Don't change your agenda, just call the agenda something else. Yeah, he called it our
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:36.120]  deteriorating atmosphere. Well, he said here are the catchphrases that I've pulled well.
[03:17:36.840 --> 03:17:41.080]  Green jobs and clean energy. So, John Kerry said, I don't want to call it cap and trade,
[03:17:41.080 --> 03:17:44.760]  I don't know what cap and trade means. It's a jobs and national security bill, clean energy,
[03:17:44.760 --> 03:17:49.800]  of course, at this year. Joe Lieberman said, oh, I don't want to call it cap and trade because
[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:54.600]  you remember the artist formerly known as Prince. Well, this is now called pollution emission.
[03:17:54.600 --> 03:17:59.640]  He said that. This is now called the pollution emission reduction credits or something.
[03:17:59.640 --> 03:18:05.720]  He won't say cap and trade. Lindsey Graham said two weeks ago, oh, this isn't a global warming bill
[03:18:05.720 --> 03:18:10.840]  because global warming no longer exists as a reason to pass legislation. It's still the
[03:18:10.840 --> 03:18:15.560]  same bill. He still said he'd vote for it. He just took his name. He said, I won't be a sponsor
[03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.120]  because I'll get in all sorts of trouble with my constituents, but I'll still support it.
[03:18:20.120 --> 03:18:24.760]  But it's no longer the reason that it's always been. The point of all this is where I begin with
[03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:30.760]  the book. Nobody says cap and trade would detectably impact climate. I repeat, nobody says the
[03:18:30.760 --> 03:18:35.000]  temperature after cap and trade would be any different than it otherwise was going to be.
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:38.280]  It's not about the temperature. It was offered in the name of the temperature.
[03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:43.480]  Their pollster told them to cut it out. Of course, it's about deciding who can have industry,
[03:18:43.480 --> 03:18:48.840]  who can have businesses and tax in the hell out of us. Yep. And in fact, here's what I do.
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:53.560]  I begin by pointing out, we know it's not about the climate. So what's it about? Well, it turns
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:58.680]  out it's bad power. It turns out that it is about they can't trust you with your various freedoms
[03:18:58.680 --> 03:19:03.560]  that they never thought they could trust you with anyway. And I've got quotes in here that are out
[03:19:03.560 --> 03:19:07.960]  there that for some reason nobody's running with. Carol Browner gave it. She's the energy and climate
[03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:12.840]  czar. We've had a phony position that position created for her because she could never achieve
[03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:17.000]  Senate confirmation and she would cause great political havoc. Of course, having been a
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:22.680]  commissioner for the Socialist International, if Obama tried to get her confirmed, she was put
[03:19:22.680 --> 03:19:27.240]  into this phony position to lower it over cabinet officials. And she gave an interview to US News
[03:19:27.240 --> 03:19:31.480]  in March of last year in which she said, it's their objective to get to the point where the
[03:19:31.480 --> 03:19:36.360]  electric utilities hold back power from you so that you'll still be able to cool your home,
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:42.440]  just not as much as you would like. Meaning what, Alex? As much as they would like. They're admitting
[03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:47.400]  it. Stay there. This is incredible. Let's come back and talk about the control freak Panoptagon
[03:19:48.280 --> 03:19:53.160]  and Texas, I already had it put into my office that I couldn't say no. California, they're going
[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:58.280]  to remote control your thermostat. They're going to run everything and surveil you. We'll be back
[03:19:58.280 --> 03:20:06.120]  with our guest. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into
[03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:11.400]  a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would
[03:20:11.400 --> 03:20:17.000]  be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only
[03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:22.280]  ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will
[03:20:22.280 --> 03:20:26.840]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it
[03:20:26.840 --> 03:20:31.240]  make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the
[03:20:31.240 --> 03:20:36.920]  gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:20:36.920 --> 03:20:42.360]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[03:20:42.360 --> 03:20:47.720]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live

[03:22:17.400 --> 03:22:23.480]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,

[03:23:03.880 --> 03:23:08.440]  Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it,
[03:23:08.440 --> 03:23:12.840]  you wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the fed
[03:23:12.840 --> 03:23:17.560]  will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:22.920]  for you. That's not what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't
[03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:27.880]  fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:23:27.880 --> 03:23:32.680]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realist, there have never
[03:23:32.680 --> 03:23:39.480]  been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30%
[03:23:39.480 --> 03:23:45.000]  while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.

[03:23:49.400 --> 03:24:04.200]  very well. Free 800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237. All right, Chris Horner's new book
[03:24:04.200 --> 03:24:09.240]  is Power Grab. We'll tell you how to get that before he leaves us. Very important info, but
[03:24:09.240 --> 03:24:13.640]  all his books are best sellers, so you'll see it all over the place. And again, I research this
[03:24:13.640 --> 03:24:17.720]  constantly. Everything he's saying is on record. That's, he's bringing up Carol Browner. He's
[03:24:17.720 --> 03:24:22.360]  gonna go over more of these. Like, we'll control your thermostat. We'll run your life. We're your
[03:24:22.360 --> 03:24:28.360]  God. What about Elena Kagan over and over again saying, if we don't like your speech, it's banned
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:35.080]  or cast Sunstein or we're gonna get your guns or the White House science are, we're gonna put stuff
[03:24:35.080 --> 03:24:40.440]  in the water to sterilize you. I mean, folks, I don't just say this. I have their white papers.
[03:24:40.440 --> 03:24:46.440]  Here's Elena Kagan, University of Chicago law review. I mean, I've got, I've got the White
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:50.840]  House science are his own textbook right here. These people, these people are in league with
[03:24:50.840 --> 03:24:55.560]  Hitler and Stalin. And I don't say that for rhetoric. Let me go back to my guest, Chris.
[03:24:56.200 --> 03:25:01.640]  You started reading her quotes. It's just, it's like a bad dream. I mean, how can these people
[03:25:01.640 --> 03:25:09.160]  be such dirtbags? So obviously evil and such a threat to everybody. I mean, most people I know
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:13.720]  with money, you're fleeing the country. Go ahead. Well, they have this, the one thing that's never
[03:25:13.720 --> 03:25:18.760]  changed is their utopian vision. It's a bit of a dystopian. Yes, me, but this idea that they will
[03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:24.120]  organize society. What changes is their vehicle? What's the excuse? What's the latest victim that
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:28.840]  has to be rescued from the horrors of individual liberty? And it was, of course, the worker and
[03:25:28.840 --> 03:25:32.920]  the worker threw off their shackles. So it became the environment, which can't speak back. Wealthier
[03:25:32.920 --> 03:25:36.760]  is healthier. Wealthier is cleaner. They have to know this, but they really hate wealth. It's just
[03:25:36.760 --> 03:25:42.600]  the excuse, the latest excuse. Freedom brings wealth. So they attack your freedom. How badly?
[03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:46.760]  Well, all right, the president has given some speeches that in isolation just seemed weird.
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:50.920]  He said, of course, under my plan of a capitrade system, electricity prices would
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:57.480]  necessarily skyrocket. He said he would use it to bankrupt industries he didn't like. His quote
[03:25:57.480 --> 03:26:02.760]  was coal, you know, natural gas, whatever the industry. Then he admitted it would be passed
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:07.720]  on to a consumer. And he said, and this will also raise billions of dollars. Well, in the book,
[03:26:07.720 --> 03:26:13.880]  I detail how I used FOIA to get treasury documents that say there was a memo written six days after
[03:26:13.880 --> 03:26:18.520]  Obama was elected, in which they said he wants to do this. Here's what we can do. And under the
[03:26:18.520 --> 03:26:25.000]  justification paragraph, they wrote revenues. This will raise quote, possibly up to several
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:31.880]  percentage points of GDP, parentheses, i.e., the equivalent of the corporate income tax rate,
[03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:36.680]  or corporate income tax. The corporate income tax among the highest in the world raises
[03:26:36.680 --> 03:26:41.880]  $400 billion per year. The biggest tax increase in our history to pay off World War II,
[03:26:41.880 --> 03:26:47.160]  which was an expiring tax, in constant dollars is $107 billion per year. So we're talking about
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:51.080]  a spectacular amount of money. But they don't just want to steal your money, they want to steal
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:54.680]  your freedoms. He gave another speech in which he said that you can't eat what you want, drive
[03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:58.600]  what you want, or put your thermostat where you want. The specific quote was, we can't eat as
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:04.040]  much as we want, drive our SUVs, and keep our thermostat at 72 degrees at all times, and expect
[03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:10.120]  that other countries are just going to say, okay, well, I didn't ask, okay, but B, what is the
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:14.360]  president of the United States doing, obsessing about how much I can eat, what I can drive,
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:19.480]  and where I can put my thermostat? Well, he's also playing us off against other countries
[03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:24.760]  and invoking hatred of us, just like he had Calderon here last week saying ban all our
[03:27:24.760 --> 03:27:30.760]  semi-automatic rifles and handguns. This is the socialist international. This is their mode.
[03:27:30.760 --> 03:27:36.040]  Well, sovereignty is not a big thing to them. They do believe that one way to skin this cat is
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:40.120]  through. Global governance is not the same as a global government, though the global
[03:27:40.120 --> 03:27:44.200]  governance crowd would, of course, love that. I'm just saying, he's a big proponent of global
[03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:49.480]  governance. What I'd like to do, if we can stay when I come back, is talk about the way they
[03:27:49.480 --> 03:27:52.760]  want to control your thermostat, and you're not going to believe the documents that someone
[03:27:52.760 --> 03:28:00.200]  slipped me. But the Guardian in the UK, Old Red herself, reported that the Obama administration
[03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:04.360]  was briefing European diplomats before Copenhagen that failed global thank goodness.
[03:28:04.360 --> 03:28:08.440]  Oh yeah, no, no, no, they're going to tax you for any amount, and then they say in peak times
[03:28:08.440 --> 03:28:11.800]  they're going to control it. That's actually, they're announcing that in California. Start
[03:28:11.800 --> 03:28:16.520]  getting into it right now. Well, okay, well, they want to use these things called smart meters.
[03:28:16.520 --> 03:28:20.440]  Smart meters put the meat on the bones of what Carol Browner said when she said,
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:24.680]  we want to get to a system whereby the utility holds back power from you. Why would the utility
[03:28:24.680 --> 03:28:28.360]  hold back power from you? They're in the business of selling you power, because there's physical
[03:28:28.360 --> 03:28:32.680]  scarcity, which this crowd is arranging, as I detail in the book, and because they've got a
[03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:37.080]  requirement that they hold back power from you. So the state is going to use the utility, according
[03:28:37.080 --> 03:28:42.840]  to the energies are, to decide, she said, you'll still be able to cool your home just not as much
[03:28:42.840 --> 03:28:48.120]  as you would like, which means just as much as they would like. Well, it turns out the Assistant
[03:28:48.120 --> 03:28:53.640]  Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency, a woman who was Al Gore's CEO before she took this job,
[03:28:53.640 --> 03:29:00.600]  making $325,000 a year as a green pressure group CEO. She divested herself of utility stocks,
[03:29:00.600 --> 03:29:04.600]  because of course the appearances would be terrible if she didn't. But someone slipped
[03:29:04.600 --> 03:29:09.080]  me her financial disclosure documents and guess what? She held on to a half million dollars
[03:29:09.640 --> 03:29:15.400]  in a smart meter company. How about that? Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy
[03:29:15.400 --> 03:29:20.200]  Efficiency, in charge of getting the smart meter mandate in, that Carol Browner says is the way
[03:29:20.200 --> 03:29:25.320]  that you can't control your thermostat, the state will. And we've got a woman who held on to
[03:29:25.320 --> 03:29:33.240]  between $265,000 and $550,000 of smart meter company stock, in addition to another green
[03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:38.200]  good jobs company her husband. It's incredible. Stay there, folks. This is why I get angry. And
[03:29:38.200 --> 03:29:44.200]  you should be angry too. They're openly saying they're going to decide what temp your house is.
[03:29:44.200 --> 03:29:50.520]  Naked body scanners aren't enough. All their taxes aren't enough. Nothing is enough for these people.
[03:29:51.560 --> 03:29:58.280]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:31:01.240 --> 03:31:05.960]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[03:31:05.960 --> 03:31:10.680]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[03:31:10.680 --> 03:31:15.640]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[03:31:15.640 --> 03:31:20.840]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?
[03:31:20.840 --> 03:31:25.480]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[03:31:25.480 --> 03:31:29.560]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[03:31:29.560 --> 03:31:34.040]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[03:31:34.040 --> 03:31:39.080]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[03:31:39.080 --> 03:31:44.840]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:44.840 --> 03:31:52.840]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out
[03:31:52.840 --> 03:31:59.400]  on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:59.400 --> 03:32:05.640]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:32:05.640 --> 03:32:09.960]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:32:09.960 --> 03:32:15.080]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[03:32:15.080 --> 03:32:20.600]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[03:32:20.600 --> 03:32:25.720]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[03:32:25.720 --> 03:32:31.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:35.480]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[03:32:35.480 --> 03:32:40.360]  from weather-related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[03:32:40.360 --> 03:32:44.360]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[03:32:44.360 --> 03:32:51.080]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[03:33:06.760 --> 03:33:11.160]  We're going back to Christopher Horner right now. New book, Power Grab,
[03:33:11.160 --> 03:33:14.120]  Obama's Green Policy Will Steal Your Freedom in Bankrupt America,
[03:33:14.760 --> 03:33:19.960]  but Matt Ryan for years, who's one of the TV slash radio board ops and producers,
[03:33:19.960 --> 03:33:26.040]  he worked at Austin Energy. And of course, he's talked about the meetings where they'd point
[03:33:26.040 --> 03:33:30.120]  out that the illegal aliens wouldn't pay their power bill. The city just said, let them have free
[03:33:30.120 --> 03:33:36.440]  power. I've talked to Austin cops. They're ordered to let them go, DWI. That's a separate issue though,
[03:33:37.160 --> 03:33:41.240]  but I walked out during the break and I said, well, the city didn't ask us here at our business.
[03:33:41.240 --> 03:33:46.840]  They came and stuck the new smart thermostat on last year. And in the brochure, it said, well,
[03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:52.280]  since your thermostat was free, businesses don't have an option, you know, free taxpayer paid for
[03:33:52.280 --> 03:34:00.760]  it, we may turn your heat down in the winter or your cool, you know, up in the summer if we're
[03:34:00.760 --> 03:34:05.560]  having problems supplying power. Now that was the old Enron scam where they got caught to
[03:34:05.560 --> 03:34:09.960]  create artificial scarcity where they were showing congressmen and the state legislature
[03:34:09.960 --> 03:34:14.040]  fake computer trades on computers. They were just making up the price and their internal
[03:34:14.040 --> 03:34:19.960]  studies showed if we double or triple prices or even turn power off, that creates the perception
[03:34:19.960 --> 03:34:24.840]  that it's scarce. And now they're doing it with the water, with power. This green movement is
[03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:31.240]  about raping you. But I briefly wanted Matt Ryan here on air. I mean, plus we can dig up the Austin
[03:34:31.240 --> 03:34:35.320]  Energy Contract says it. I mean, I'd read this, but he goes, no, you're absolutely correct.
[03:34:35.320 --> 03:34:44.200]  Austin already has this. They already control this building's thermostat. I am under these
[03:34:44.200 --> 03:34:48.440]  criminals control. Matt Ryan, tell folks, right, these programmable thermostats are one of the
[03:34:48.440 --> 03:34:53.720]  green initiatives sponsored by Austin Energy. You call them up, they'll give you a free thermostat,
[03:34:53.720 --> 03:34:59.560]  a programmable thermostat, it'll work for you 24 seven around the clock, except during what they
[03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:06.360]  call peak usage times, which is a time period usually in the afternoon when they say, okay,
[03:35:06.360 --> 03:35:10.920]  well, there's a lot of people turning their ACs on, they can turn yours off and they will turn
[03:35:10.920 --> 03:35:16.760]  yours off for usually about 15 minutes during a day when they feel that they're having peak usage.
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:22.280]  And that's in the federal legislation to even control what goes in air conditioners.
[03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:27.000]  Just like your cell phone since 96 tracks you in real time, they're designing the big brother
[03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:31.560]  grid. But I want to tell you with this business, we don't have a choice, right? They are our Lord
[03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:36.840]  and they are our King. I can't tell you how many times I got a, I got a call from an apartment
[03:35:36.840 --> 03:35:41.160]  tenant saying, why did y'all come out here and put this in? I do not want this meter in here.
[03:35:41.160 --> 03:35:46.040]  And it's their landlord that said, Oh, programmable thermostats, that's a perk, we'll give it to all
[03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:50.200]  of our, our tenants and whether they like it or not. And believe me, they would complain.
[03:35:50.200 --> 03:35:53.800]  They got an energy thermostat. I want to have you back and talk about this more in the future.
[03:35:53.800 --> 03:35:57.400]  I want to go back to Christopher Horner, but thank you for coming in and telling us. So,
[03:35:57.400 --> 03:36:02.200]  so, so Christopher Horner, here we are. I mean, I'm already under these people's control. And if
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:07.880]  they can naked body scan my kids to fly, if they can control the temperature in my office, I mean,
[03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:13.080]  literally, this is worse than the Soviet Union. What they're talking about is squeezing you at
[03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:18.520]  both ends. They're trying to ration the physical supply, create physical scarcity where there
[03:36:18.520 --> 03:36:23.000]  should not be any. Remember, United States fits on the world's largest energy reserves. We don't
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:28.440]  have physical scarcity that would lead to this sort of in essence, micro brownout. But you're
[03:36:28.440 --> 03:36:33.480]  going to get to the larger point of brownouts, because we're following the UK's path of saying,
[03:36:33.480 --> 03:36:38.200]  no coal, no nuclear, we'll just build offshore wind farms someday. And then you're going to see them
[03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:40.840]  obsessing about the fact when they get the Olympics, they're actually not going to have the
[03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:45.800]  electricity. But what you've got here is browner is saying things like, Okay, this is not just
[03:36:45.800 --> 03:36:50.280]  the smart meter that'll tell us when you're using your energy. What I guess this Kathy's always
[03:36:50.280 --> 03:36:55.240]  also invested in with this company Landis and Gear, a Swiss smart meter company, half million
[03:36:55.240 --> 03:37:00.120]  dollars worth of stock, and just wait till she succeeds in getting those mandated in one of
[03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:04.840]  the biggest markets in the world. They're talking about also getting to the point,
[03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:08.840]  like Matt was discussing, whereby they can say, I'm sorry, you've been running your
[03:37:08.840 --> 03:37:14.840]  dishwasher too often, wrong time of day, close watchers, sorry. Carol Browner sold it in this
[03:37:14.840 --> 03:37:19.720]  interview to US News as a savings to the consumer. And I just want your listeners to know they're
[03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:24.840]  saving a fortune in India right now in Haiti and all over the world by not using energy.
[03:37:24.840 --> 03:37:28.120]  But we live in the richest country in the world sitting on top of the world's largest energy
[03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:32.920]  resources, but that means we have freedom and they don't like it. Ben Jones, the communist
[03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:37.800]  self about communist radical, he said the green as this is a quote also in the book,
[03:37:37.800 --> 03:37:42.920]  among many others, the green economy will start off as a small subset and we will push it and
[03:37:42.920 --> 03:37:50.200]  push it and push it until it becomes the engine for, wait for it, transforming the whole society.
[03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:56.920]  Yes, he said that. It always comes down to this is the vehicle for doing to this terribly flawed
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:38:02.200]  transgressor of America that they have to fundamentally transform. This is the vehicle,
[03:38:02.200 --> 03:38:05.960]  this is the excuse, your freedoms are simply nothing you can be trusted with.
[03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:11.160]  And then meanwhile in Ron, and of course you briefly worked for him for about a month and
[03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:15.880]  you quit and exposed it all on record and valiantly so, they wrote the cap and trade
[03:38:15.880 --> 03:38:22.200]  carbon tax fraud, literally made off level, going back to California, they tried the same scam there
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:27.560]  and in their memos it said, we turn their power off, then they perceive it's more valuable,
[03:38:27.560 --> 03:38:33.320]  they'll put up with a triple price increase. Ha, ha, ha, we're raping these schmucks.
[03:38:33.320 --> 03:38:37.000]  I mean, so you've got the big money, it's just not free market money,
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:42.920]  who wants this government monopoly. I think that's the key to defeat these little green devils,
[03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:47.160]  is to expose that they could care less about the environment. This is all a way just to
[03:38:47.160 --> 03:38:52.360]  run everybody's lives. Yeah, the temperature after cap and trade will be according to everybody,
[03:38:52.360 --> 03:38:55.960]  whatever it would have been. So we know it's not about that, what it's an excuse.
[03:38:56.520 --> 03:38:59.400]  And the point is, the president comes out there and this is another quote, he said,
[03:38:59.400 --> 03:39:03.480]  some of America's biggest companies support this. My way of saying, so it must be a good idea,
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:09.880]  of course, that's usually his position, right? No one's ever asked publicly, okay, but why?
[03:39:10.520 --> 03:39:15.080]  Why is GE, which has Enron's old windmills, which nobody wants unless you mandate and
[03:39:15.080 --> 03:39:20.680]  heavily subsidize them, why is the gas, the gas industry is actually running these ads,
[03:39:20.680 --> 03:39:25.960]  calling for more windmills, because more windmills simply mean more gas. You can't really dial a
[03:39:25.960 --> 03:39:32.520]  coal plant up and down to meet the schizophrenia of the wind, but you can be more easily with gas.
[03:39:32.520 --> 03:39:38.120]  Oh yeah, they know the wind doesn't work, doesn't transfer the power, they love it,
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:42.840]  exactly, the gas refining companies, they love it, they go, sure, idiots, get rid of coal,
[03:39:42.840 --> 03:39:47.720]  shut down what produces 51% of our power, shut down our competition, we love it.
[03:39:49.400 --> 03:39:55.400]  Well, you're right about creating artificial scarcity and the seeming paradox of it,
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:40:00.600]  and business is pushing the idea of scarcity, but you also pointed out why businesses can
[03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:05.080]  benefit from scarcity. Now, what I did in the book is I pointed out this is by no means,
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:09.800]  and it's obviously the world's second oldest profession, but this is also the very long
[03:40:09.800 --> 03:40:15.400]  history in the US, and there are left-wingers who point out that the history of the progressive
[03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:20.200]  movement was the corporate tie-ups to keep competition out, to lock in a nice livelihood
[03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:25.080]  for themselves with their bodies in government, and this is absolutely reminiscent of that for
[03:40:25.080 --> 03:40:30.200]  reasons I go into. And again, it started with the railroads and then various other industries,
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:34.920]  we've now got it with something extremely important to your lives and your family's lives,
[03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:39.400]  and our national security and your family's security, and that is energy. They're seeking to
[03:40:39.400 --> 03:40:45.160]  script scarcity, dangerous scarcity, in the name of a bogeyman that keeps changing and now
[03:40:45.160 --> 03:40:50.040]  is national security. But then they'll be the savior with your energy allotment of your poor.
[03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:55.320]  Once they make you poor, now you're dependent on them and you'll vote. You want power in the
[03:40:55.320 --> 03:41:02.840]  winter, old lady? Vote to ban the Second Amendment. Well, I'll tell you this, this is a very big
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:09.000]  tent probably for a lot of reasons. There's a strange thing going on when you look at why are
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:13.880]  the population zealots so supportive of this? Why are the fallen communists so supportive?
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:19.400]  The persistent communists, the greens, the red, the pro-tax, the anti-development,
[03:41:19.400 --> 03:41:25.720]  there is a very broad coalition here that I want folks to think about this. Why is this
[03:41:25.720 --> 03:41:30.680]  extremely disparate group, along with some of us, the President said, America's biggest companies,
[03:41:30.680 --> 03:41:35.000]  pushing something, you're not at the table to get essentially screwed. They're negotiating you
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:40.120]  out of the deal, but at your expense. All of them have this agenda in common. Why? And the why is,
[03:41:40.120 --> 03:41:46.200]  again, the point of the book. This is a vehicle for their long-held wish list of organizing
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:50.840]  society. And there will be trade-offs, yes, involved, and your life will be very different,
[03:41:50.840 --> 03:41:56.680]  and when they orchestrate collapse on one level or another, it's true. They rush in with more
[03:41:56.680 --> 03:42:00.920]  state as the solution. Now, the President is lecturing Spain to cut it out right now
[03:42:00.920 --> 03:42:04.680]  because he doesn't want them to drag us down, be the next grease, and drag us down with them,
[03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:09.720]  because he's got a fundamental transformation to impose here. But last week in a Spanish newspaper,
[03:42:09.720 --> 03:42:16.120]  like I said, there was a full-paged article, the headline of which was, quote, direct translation.
[03:42:16.120 --> 03:42:20.040]  Spain admits that green economy, as sold to Obama, is a disaster.
[03:42:20.040 --> 03:42:25.080]  Yeah, I saw that. So here's the deal. Their globalization, their command destruction, their
[03:42:25.720 --> 03:42:32.440]  neofutilism has been too good at destroying things, and so it's blowing up in their face
[03:42:32.440 --> 03:42:38.920]  before they get all the vice grips in place. I have to say that when the state controls power,
[03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:45.640]  the state controls an awful lot. And what this agenda does is transfer basic energy use and
[03:42:45.640 --> 03:42:49.640]  production and transmission, all these decisions from individuals, producers, and consumers to the
[03:42:49.640 --> 03:42:55.080]  state. And when you do that, you are giving up an awful lot of your liberties. Now, I married a
[03:42:55.080 --> 03:43:00.040]  European. She's from a country where they have a joke, at least they're still laughing for now,
[03:43:00.040 --> 03:43:03.960]  that it's a good thing we don't have all the cars we pay for. Where would we put them? What they
[03:43:03.960 --> 03:43:09.080]  mean by that in Denmark is, through the special assessment and the bad, they have doubled the
[03:43:09.080 --> 03:43:14.520]  price of cars there in order to force scarcity upon the public because it's a wealthy country,
[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:19.080]  and they would have all these cars. Oh, no. The status didn't care for that. And so what they did
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:24.280]  is they, in effect, doubled the price of a vehicle to force the population out of automobility.
[03:43:24.280 --> 03:43:28.360]  Now, when you start letting go of automobility, pretty soon you'll find yourself letting go of
[03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:33.640]  control of every basic decision. It's like the temp, as you pointed out. Now, when you let go of
[03:43:33.640 --> 03:43:37.880]  things like this, please don't be surprised when you wake up one morning and there's an awful lot
[03:43:37.880 --> 03:43:45.000]  more that's just gone. Well, no. I mean, the social engineers admit that they want to have one child
[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:49.480]  policy, that they want to decide what we're going to be when we grow up. They're literally
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:55.000]  organizing all of human society in a nightmarish way. I mean, we know when people try to organize
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:44:00.360]  things from top down, it always is a disaster. But they want to wreck things. And that's my next
[03:44:00.360 --> 03:44:05.560]  question to you because you're an insider who really studies this. Every incumbent, whether the
[03:44:05.560 --> 03:44:10.760]  Republican or Democrat, is being thrown out of office, whether it's Specter, whether it's what
[03:44:10.760 --> 03:44:14.920]  just happened in Congressional seat in Hawaii, whether it's Massachusetts, it doesn't matter.
[03:44:16.200 --> 03:44:21.240]  I've never seen such a realignment against the establishment. So they've really,
[03:44:22.200 --> 03:44:28.360]  Obama was the fake revolution against Bush. Now people realize, my God, Obama is the real takeover.
[03:44:28.360 --> 03:44:33.080]  And so people are really, I mean, as the bigger present, he last week said,
[03:44:33.080 --> 03:44:38.040]  our global governance is in trouble. He said, the people have finally woken up worldwide do us.
[03:44:38.040 --> 03:44:42.760]  We're now in trouble. I don't know if you saw that speech, but they admit they're in trouble.
[03:44:42.760 --> 03:44:48.920]  How do you see them striking back? Or, I mean, because from every way I slice this,
[03:44:48.920 --> 03:44:52.200]  we are now really at the maker to break it crossroads.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:58.280]  Well, there is a real push. And again, I was in the room in The Hague in November 2000,
[03:44:58.280 --> 03:45:03.000]  when Jacques Chirac gave his speech calling Kyoto, the global warming treaty that covered 35
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:07.320]  industrial titans like Iceland, Luxembourg, Belgium, Slovenia, Slovakia, but not China,
[03:45:07.320 --> 03:45:11.480]  India, Mexico, Brazil, and so on. I was in the room with some members of Congress and a few
[03:45:11.480 --> 03:45:15.560]  other Americans who were the only ones surprised when Jacques Chirac, who at the time was the
[03:45:15.560 --> 03:45:19.720]  president of France, said Kyoto was the first component of an authentic global governance.
[03:45:19.720 --> 03:45:23.960]  Jim Sensenbrenner is a Wisconsin Republican who marched outside and held an impromptu press
[03:45:23.960 --> 03:45:28.520]  conference that I stood there watching. The left-wing press swearing at him. The Guardian
[03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:32.040]  reporter was swearing bollocks at him. And Sensenbrenner said,
[03:45:32.040 --> 03:45:34.680]  if you want to keep us out of something, call it global governance.
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:40.120]  Well, I said the Guardian noted that Obama's diplomats were telling EU diplomats there may
[03:45:40.120 --> 03:45:44.600]  be a delay on Kyoto too in the United States because he's considering something called
[03:45:44.600 --> 03:45:49.000]  a congressional executive agreement. That was, I heard you mentioned NAFTA before.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:52.920]  NAFTA is precedent. It's never been tried. The constitutionality of this,
[03:45:52.920 --> 03:45:57.720]  it did not get to this. But the issue of Congress waiving Article II, Section II,
[03:45:57.720 --> 03:46:03.560]  ratification, advice and consent, the two-thirds ratification, NAFTA was a treaty between three
[03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:07.560]  countries that Congress just said is not a treaty. And they granted something called
[03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:13.160]  fast-track authority, which is a suggestion of what should be in it and a promise to give it an
[03:46:13.160 --> 03:46:20.440]  up or down, no amendment, no filibuster, 50 plus one vote in both houses. Now, if you do this,
[03:46:20.440 --> 03:46:23.960]  and the administration apparently is telling Europeans, we may have to try this because
[03:46:23.960 --> 03:46:28.280]  we're going to call Kyoto II not a treaty. You're going to have a problem because it's
[03:46:28.280 --> 03:46:32.040]  then left up to the courts and you know how activist they become. But what you're talking
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:36.840]  about is you have one bite at the apple. Don't trust the courts. You saw campaign finance.
[03:46:36.840 --> 03:46:41.000]  Oh, don't worry, the court will fix it. Don't trust them. What you have to do is block it
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:47.320]  at the granting of fast-track for Kyoto II. They won't call it Kyoto II. They're going to call it
[03:46:47.320 --> 03:46:52.840]  Johannesburg because that's where the World Environment Summit is in 2012. They're actually
[03:46:52.840 --> 03:47:01.400]  going to try to get Kyoto II according to lefty advisors to Obama, like this fellow Nigel Purvis
[03:47:01.400 --> 03:47:07.560]  who's counseling him, just declared this next key global warming treaty not a treaty. It's got all,
[03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:12.520]  it quacks, flies and does everything. Oh, he's like a duck. But if you get Congress to say
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:18.600]  it's not a treaty, then the only difference is it means no toothless ratification. Well,
[03:47:18.600 --> 03:47:22.040]  that's your one bite at the apple. The courts aren't going to help you, it's my guess.
[03:47:22.600 --> 03:47:27.880]  And you have a 50 plus one requirement and it would take, you know, you see income is being
[03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:32.840]  thrown out, but I just don't know given the way, you know, you didn't see the Democrat.
[03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:37.400]  So they're going to come at us with a violation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights
[03:47:37.400 --> 03:47:45.080]  treason like this article, top official says feds may not process illegals referred from Arizona.
[03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:49.320]  So, you know, citizens have no rights, but if illegal aliens get arrested, we won't pick them
[03:47:49.320 --> 03:47:53.880]  up. So it's the same thing here. The federal government doesn't care what we say or who we
[03:47:53.880 --> 03:47:59.560]  elect or what we do. They're just going to do it because they're God expanding on that
[03:48:01.400 --> 03:48:06.200]  and, you know, trying to see where you see this going. What about the Republicans? I mean,
[03:48:06.200 --> 03:48:10.600]  you know, they've got a big hand in allowing this to happen as well. Yeah, you've got a problem.
[03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:16.280]  Right now, for example, this week, we're supposed to have a vote. Just request 51 or 50 votes,
[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:21.960]  not 60 saying EPA does not have the authority to do this through the back door. This, of course,
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:26.440]  came through the courts. It was a five, four decision we lost. I represented the skeptic
[03:48:26.440 --> 03:48:32.120]  scientists in this case, the Supreme Court ruled five to four in Massachusetts versus EPA saying
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:38.760]  EPA has the authority, does not have to, but has the authority to treat exhalation as pollution.
[03:48:39.320 --> 03:48:45.480]  Well, there's a resolution by Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and she's saying EPA does
[03:48:45.480 --> 03:48:51.560]  not, Congress has allowed to vote veto major rules within 60 days, and she's saying no.
[03:48:51.560 --> 03:48:55.720]  The problem is it has 41 cosponsors, three Democrats, and that means three Republicans
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:49:00.920]  have said no. They're from the Northeast to no surprise. Scott Brown and the ladies from Maine.
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:05.960]  Now, Scott Brown during the campaign said that climate changes, we all know this. What I don't
[03:49:05.960 --> 03:49:10.120]  want to do is something as big as what EPA's proposing or cap and trade without getting to
[03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:13.720]  the bottom of the scientific scandals. Well, I assure you, we've not gotten to the bottom
[03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:17.800]  of the scientific scandals. I submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the University of
[03:49:17.800 --> 03:49:22.840]  Virginia on Friday. I'm not sure how far we'll get, but we will litigate it. We're suing NASA
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:27.560]  probably this week for our own climate gate. We're pushing this, but right now we've already
[03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:33.480]  got three Republicans in the Senate who have not cosponsored a bill to say EPA will not do this
[03:49:33.480 --> 03:49:39.080]  to the back door. Instead, the world's greatest deliberative body, why we shall deliberate on
[03:49:39.080 --> 03:49:42.440]  what will be the biggest intervention in our economy and our history. And you have three
[03:49:42.440 --> 03:49:48.280]  Republicans just cosponsoring this thing. You need to shut down the business of the Senate
[03:49:48.280 --> 03:49:52.680]  if the administration tries to do this through the back door, and three Republicans have not
[03:49:52.680 --> 03:49:56.760]  cosponsored it. Is that why they're so scared of Rand Paul because he gave that speech saying
[03:49:56.760 --> 03:50:01.000]  we're not going to let you use a fake environmentalism to shut our economy down?
[03:50:01.880 --> 03:50:06.760]  I'm sure he troubles some by pointing some things out. I was told by the Spanish Green
[03:50:06.760 --> 03:50:12.040]  Jobs professor, Dr. Calzada, in an email that Rand Paul, in one of his acceptance speeches,
[03:50:12.040 --> 03:50:16.040]  pointed out that there's a new steel mill in Kentucky, the North American Stainless Plant,
[03:50:16.040 --> 03:50:21.800]  with 175 workers. I write about this in my book, PowerGrab, in which those steel workers are jobs
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:26.760]  that are sent from Spain because of cap-and-trade and green jobs schemes. The CEO was very clear.
[03:50:26.760 --> 03:50:29.640]  He said, you can make windmills out of steel, but you can't make steel using windmills.
[03:50:29.640 --> 03:50:35.080]  I'm paraphrasing. But Rand Paul pointed this out, and I don't think people in Washington
[03:50:35.080 --> 03:50:38.200]  like to hear the idea that the state is not responsible for economic growth.
[03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:47.160]  Yeah, I mean, the grass grows, the sky is blue, the sun comes up in the morning because
[03:50:47.160 --> 03:50:53.960]  because Barack Obama reads off a teleprompter. Stay there. Final segment with our guest,
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:58.600]  the new book. I've got to read it. PowerGrab, how Obama's green policies will steal your
[03:50:58.600 --> 03:51:06.200]  freedom in bankrupt America. Don't answer it. If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings,
[03:51:06.200 --> 03:51:10.920]  knowing it may be another bill collector, it's time for you to call zero dead in 90 days.

[03:52:01.160 --> 03:52:06.120]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:52:06.120 --> 03:52:12.040]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which
[03:52:12.040 --> 03:52:17.160]  protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for
[03:52:17.160 --> 03:52:22.200]  dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[03:52:22.200 --> 03:52:28.840]  our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's gonna ask you what
[03:52:28.840 --> 03:52:33.560]  you did during the Patriot uprising. You have been warned. We have the facts. We have the
[03:52:33.560 --> 03:52:38.040]  constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law. Knowledge is power, ladies and
[03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:42.520]  gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you. Don't tread on me. Rise the republic.
[03:52:42.520 --> 03:52:47.400]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.

[03:53:00.600 --> 03:53:07.640]  The problem. How do I cook food without power? How do I light my home with no electricity?
[03:53:08.200 --> 03:53:12.520]  How do I get emergency radio broadcast? How can I make safe drinking water?
[03:53:13.320 --> 03:53:16.360]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking,
[03:53:16.360 --> 03:53:21.480]  home lighting, listening to the radio and producing clean water is the family emergency kit from

[03:54:33.160 --> 03:54:37.880]  and videos make this radio broadcast what we do here possible. So you've got big mega corporations
[03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:43.000]  in bed with government to create monopolies. As John D. Rockefeller the first said,
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:49.720]  competition is a sin. And this will destroy our free market system that's made this nation so great,
[03:54:49.720 --> 03:54:53.000]  has nothing to do with the environment. Chris, we were talking during the break
[03:54:53.000 --> 03:54:58.840]  and you played many times before the supreme court. The arrogance level though, I mean,
[03:54:58.840 --> 03:55:05.880]  I don't see republicans opposing Elena Kagan who is like Joe Stalin in drag or something. And then
[03:55:05.880 --> 03:55:10.920]  I was talking to you about what's happening with BP and it just seems like it's a lawlessness,
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:16.520]  but give us your take on that in closing. Well, what we said before going out last time was the
[03:55:16.520 --> 03:55:21.240]  idea to many elected officials that Washington is not responsible for economic growth is an
[03:55:21.240 --> 03:55:26.120]  asthma here. So somebody like Rand Paul who's going to come up and say those things is going
[03:55:26.120 --> 03:55:31.080]  to be a troublemaker and isolated. You've got companies like BP who choose. Remember their
[03:55:31.080 --> 03:55:36.520]  favorite politician in the last two decades was Barack Obama, a guy who swore to cause your
[03:55:36.520 --> 03:55:42.520]  listeners energy prices to skyrocket. BP had no problem with that. Obama swore he had no problem
[03:55:42.520 --> 03:55:46.600]  with high gas prices. He just said they shouldn't go up too fast for the obvious reason.
[03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:52.040]  People will start calling for policies that will allow us greater access to the greatest energy
[03:55:52.040 --> 03:55:56.120]  reserves in the world. So you've got a problem with these companies like BP that are a bit,
[03:55:56.120 --> 03:56:01.080]  look, they can have their public spats now, but it's not that much of a spat. BP remains in bed
[03:56:01.080 --> 03:56:07.720]  mostly with the left, sometimes with the right, in Washington style, right, because they like
[03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.320]  Enron lost the plot. They began as an energy company and then they started to try to make
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:16.200]  money off of derivatives and windmills and solar panels and pushing paper and not making anything.
[03:56:16.200 --> 03:56:20.840]  They tried to make money off of doing nothing. Now, a couple of months after I left Enron in
[03:56:20.840 --> 03:56:28.680]  97, there was an Oval Office meeting August 4th, 1997, Sir John Brown of BP and Ken Lay from Enron
[03:56:28.680 --> 03:56:34.920]  with the President of the United States and the Vice President Al Gore. And on August 1st, 1997,
[03:56:34.920 --> 03:56:39.800]  a Friday, in preparation for the Monday Oval Office meeting, there was a briefing memo written
[03:56:39.800 --> 03:56:45.480]  for Ken Lay, which is available online at masterresource.org. You can find it. In it, they say,
[03:56:45.480 --> 03:56:49.560]  okay, the unanimous Senate, I mean, the context was a week or so before the Senate had unanimous
[03:56:49.560 --> 03:56:54.040]  list that don't go to Kyoto and do this. So these two fellows, Ken Lay and John Brown of BP,
[03:56:54.040 --> 03:56:59.560]  go into the Oval Office and they say, ignore that Senate. You got to go to Kyoto and you got
[03:56:59.560 --> 03:57:04.200]  to do it and here's what it has to be. And since, obviously, we know who won that one,
[03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:07.800]  there's a memo also available at master resource and I discussed it in my book,
[03:57:07.800 --> 03:57:14.040]  from Ken Lay's Kyoto advisor from Kyoto, five months later saying this treaty is exactly what
[03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:18.120]  we've been loving for. So the unanimous Senate gets ignored when they say, look, you know,
[03:57:18.120 --> 03:57:22.440]  we go along with a lot, but not there. Not with Jackson Rock Coastal Global Governance,
[03:57:22.440 --> 03:57:25.880]  not an obvious wealth transfer, not obviously rashing energy here.
[03:57:25.880 --> 03:57:29.400]  How has the Senate changed, though? I mean, they can see that everything Obama's doing
[03:57:29.400 --> 03:57:33.080]  is political suicide and still it looks like they'll be able to pass it. I mean,
[03:57:33.080 --> 03:57:36.040]  are they all bought off? Are they blackmailed? What's going on?
[03:57:36.040 --> 03:57:40.040]  Well, Lindsey Graham's got so much pushback. He was the test case and now the folks in
[03:57:40.040 --> 03:57:44.200]  South Carolina aren't happy with him. And so he says he'll vote for it, but he won't be a co-spot.
[03:57:44.200 --> 03:57:48.440]  Look, progress. I know, as Cap Weinberger said about they taunt, if this is progress,
[03:57:48.440 --> 03:57:52.920]  we can't afford much more progress. But you start setting some examples here.
[03:57:52.920 --> 03:57:57.160]  When Democrats are running as anti-capitrators, as happened in the Pennsylvania race in which
[03:57:57.160 --> 03:58:02.680]  they succeeded, when Scott Brown wins Massachusetts, saying in Cambridge that, no, no, no, you don't do
[03:58:02.680 --> 03:58:06.040]  this until you get to the bottom of what stinks. Of course, we don't know where he's going to vote
[03:58:06.040 --> 03:58:10.520]  on this thing. You are turning a very big ship of status and trying to steal your liberty,
[03:58:10.520 --> 03:58:12.920]  but break that book and listen to what they're saying.
[03:58:12.920 --> 03:58:16.600]  No, no, I agree with you. I mean, we're having victories that they're having to bait and switch
[03:58:16.600 --> 03:58:21.880]  now and aren't calling it cap-and-trade. Amazing. Christopher Horner, thank you for coming on with
[03:58:21.880 --> 03:58:27.880]  us. The book is PowerGrab, in stores all over, CEI.org. We'll talk to you again soon.
