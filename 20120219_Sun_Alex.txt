[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.000]  Yes we do. I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the historic Lakewood Theater here in Dallas, Texas
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  where I'm going to be premiering a still unnamed 45 minute documentary that's powerful.
[00:54.000 --> 01:02.000]  And right before we went live here I was still trying to think of what is the name of this new film that we're going to premiere this evening.
[01:02.000 --> 01:09.000]  I've got to think of a name by the time that I actually get on air. So that is coming up today.
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  We're going to have Jim Mars showing up here in the next 30 minutes or so and he's scheduled to be with us in studio or here on the road.
[01:16.000 --> 01:30.000]  In the second hour we have one of the people that was on the show preppers on the Nat Geo channel.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  He's going to be on the broadcast with us. He of course had his guns confiscated just because he went to visit the doctor for some chest pains.
[01:38.000 --> 01:48.000]  And they said, well we're going to go ahead and take your firearms away from you. So we've got Kurt Haskell, Jim Mars and others joining us today.
[01:48.000 --> 01:59.000]  In fact, Kurt Haskell who just a few days ago at the sentencing of the underwear bomber who was put on the aircraft on Christmas Day by the U.S. Government
[01:59.000 --> 02:08.000]  at the sentencing Kurt Haskell was able to expose to the world that this was basically a patsy setup and a false flag inside job operation.
[02:08.000 --> 02:17.000]  So he is going to be joining us coming up right after this break that is about to happen here in just one moment.
[02:17.000 --> 02:26.000]  We will also of course get into some of the latest news and developments at infowars.com.
[02:26.000 --> 02:33.000]  U.N. guidelines are recruiting religious leaders as agents of change for a one world religion.
[02:33.000 --> 02:40.000]  That's official by the U.N. They're openly announcing world government, world taxation, world regulation, world agenda 21, the end of the family.
[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  Also drug stores are pushing all different types of poison including fluoridated water for children, mercury, laden vaccines and more.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  I'm going to be going over a report on that.
[02:53.000 --> 03:02.000]  Also, there's more evidence coming out that the U.S., Israel and NATO are putting al-Qaeda into Syria to try to destabilize that country.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  We're not saying Assad's a good guy here.
[03:04.000 --> 03:14.000]  We're just simply stating al-Qaeda is even worse and they claim that we should give up all our rights because of al-Qaeda and let the TSA fondle all of us to keep us safe.
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  It's absolutely patently ridiculous to a level that I can't even begin to fathom or imagine.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  So it's all coming up today.
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  Kurt Haskell, then the gentleman on top of that from the show, Hoarders, is also going to be joining us.
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  I had some notes here and I had his name written on a cocktail napkin.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  That's my big prep for the guest here today, but it's David Sardy.
[03:39.000 --> 03:48.000]  Of course, we wrote an article about that earlier in the week and it's gotten no media coverage basically even though it was a big national TV show that his guns have been confiscated.
[03:48.000 --> 03:57.000]  He complained of chest pains and then didn't agree to their medical treatment so they said, well, then we're going to take your firearms.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  That shows that you're crazy.
[03:59.000 --> 04:09.000]  And they've got, of course, the new psychological evaluations that are being added into the psychological evaluation handbook that says not trusting government is mentally ill.
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  So George Washington, of course, today would be put on different types of Prozac or maybe even lithium that the government's calling for to be put in the water.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  Because he didn't trust or like his big fat stinking government.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  So that's just some of what's coming up.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  We are, again, live from the historic Lakewood Theater here in Dallas, Texas.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  And unfortunately, all of the tickets have sold out.
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  They were holding like 5% back at the door and those have all sold out.
[04:39.000 --> 04:50.000]  They tell me that they're allowed to sell a few standing room only tickets for people that are willing to stand, obviously.
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  And so you may be able to still show up and get in.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  I hope you can.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[04:56.000 --> 05:10.000]  The problem is never getting a big enough venue.
[05:26.000 --> 05:31.000]  The best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  Check it out for yourself. It's incredible.
[05:47.000 --> 05:56.000]  Go to InfowarsTeam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[05:56.000 --> 06:21.000]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:36.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:36.000 --> 06:55.000]  We are blasting out worldwide on over 100 AM and FM stations, XM, of course Global Shortwave WWCR, number one when it comes to audio streams and podcasts, according to Alexa Shopcast and many other metrics like Google Analytics.
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Sunday evening.
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  This is four o'clock and six minutes Central Standard Time.
[07:06.000 --> 07:17.000]  And the reason I like to start the broadcast at least once a week, pointing out that we are reaching 3 million people by radio a day, over a million people a day by internet, website, and of course, millions a week,
[07:17.000 --> 07:29.000]  uncounted via YouTube and other systems, a total of 15 million plus a week and growing, is because it shows that people are hungry for hardcore, reality-based information.
[07:29.000 --> 07:47.000]  It shows that as a society, when people stand up and get involved and resist tyranny, that we're able to turn back what seems like unending waves of corruption.
[07:47.000 --> 08:01.000]  Now, we are joined by a gentleman who, well, broke major information, but he was also a survivor.
[08:01.000 --> 08:12.000]  He was the survivor of the underwear bombing two Christmases ago, about a year and two months ago now, or more, and of course his name is Kurt Haskell.
[08:12.000 --> 08:25.000]  Now, Kurt Haskell was flying back from Europe and he was flying with his wife, who's also a lawyer, and he witnessed a sharp-dress man getting who we now know as the underwear bomber on the aircraft.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  And then he witnessed a bunch of other weird behavior on the plane.
[08:28.000 --> 08:36.000]  He reported that he saw what looked like government people getting him on the aircraft, past security without proper ID, at the gate.
[08:36.000 --> 08:53.000]  And then for a month and a half, the media didn't cover it until, well, C-SPAN aired congressional hearings where the undersecretary of state came out and admitted that they were ordered by an unnamed U.S. agency to get him on the aircraft.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  And joining us now to discuss this is Kurt Haskell.
[08:56.000 --> 09:14.000]  Obviously, the underwear bomber pled guilty was his family threatened. Is he mentally ill? As many people have said, we're not sure, but we do know that he was gotten on the aircraft and protected and that that whole thing was launched right as the naked body scanners were being rolled out against the population.
[09:14.000 --> 09:31.000]  So Kurt Haskell joins us now because as a victim, he was able to read into the court record his victim statement where he was able to expose the fact that this was a false flag patsy event, and he told the underwear bomber, you are not a Muslim hero.
[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  You are a pathetic patsy to paraphrase him. Kurt, thank you for joining us here today.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  Sure. Glad to be back, Alex.
[09:39.000 --> 09:50.000]  These are short segments. We're going to break here in about five minutes. You got the floor, but for new listeners, recap the basics of what happened in a few minutes and then get into the sentencing and what you said there.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  And finally, other than my show, you were able to get out some of the information of the cover-up.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  Yeah. You want me to go back to what actually happened on the Christmas day flight?
[10:01.000 --> 10:11.000]  Sure, I mean, whatever you think is best, but I mean, some people are like, hey, the guys said he did it, so case closed. Okay, well, why did the government get him on the aircraft? That's admitted.
[10:11.000 --> 10:26.000]  Yeah. Well, you know, I saw him before we board and I saw him being escorted around security by a man in a tan suit who told the desk worker he didn't have a passport and then they were sent to talk to a manager.
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  You know, and then all of a sudden he's on our flight trying to blow it up a few hours later.
[10:31.000 --> 10:39.000]  You know, and that was just the start of it. And then, you know, I talked to the FBI. I think I'm helping them catch an accomplice.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  I find out soon enough that they don't really want to talk to me.
[10:44.000 --> 10:57.000]  They lie about the existence of this man, you know, only a month later than ABC News puts a couple sentences in the bottom of another article where the government changes their story and now admits that he exists.
[10:57.000 --> 11:11.000]  But they try and portray him as an OKTA member helping the bomber, you know, get through security, which was impossible because he had some kind of security clearance and went to the desk and said, hey, he's from Sudan.
[11:11.000 --> 11:18.000]  We do this all the time, you know, helping him board without a passport. So I knew it wasn't OKTA at all.
[11:18.000 --> 11:30.000]  You know, and then all the other anomalies, you know, the Patrick Kennedy testimony in Congress where the government admitted that they knew he was a terrorist had been tracking him wanting to lend him into the U.S.
[11:30.000 --> 11:41.000]  so they could follow him and catch other accomplices. Now, there is that admission. There was a string of other so-called terrorist attacks where the government admitted to handing out fake bombs.
[11:41.000 --> 11:52.000]  We had his standby attorney, Anthony Chambers, admit that he had seen the reports from the explosive experts hired by the government.
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  And those reports indicated that the bomb was impossibly defective because it lacked a blasting cap. You know, it goes on and on and on.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  I had another passenger call me and confirm that she saw exactly what I did, but she was too scared to come forward.
[12:08.000 --> 12:16.000]  And, you know, and then we have all these measures put in place after this because of, you know, a security breach.
[12:16.000 --> 12:26.000]  But really, there was no security breach at all except the one created by the government. You know, but this was the incident that led to the body-scanning machines.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  It led to the renewal of certain parts of the Patriot Act that were going to expire. And obviously...
[12:32.000 --> 12:40.000]  And let's remember, they'd already pre-ordered the machines, but this happened about two weeks before the official rollout of them, perfect PR timing.
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  And as you've pointed out, it's the cover-up, it's the evidence of the crime, it's them lying the whole time and then you being proven correct.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  It's the fact that they said, oh, the guy that helped get him on must have been Al Qaeda.
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  But then it turns out the U.S. government ordered the State Department to help get him the visa and all the rest of it and help get him on the aircraft.
[12:57.000 --> 13:06.000]  And then the trial, that's what really clenched it for you because I remember a year ago or more when we first were talking, you know, you were about 99 percent sure.
[13:06.000 --> 13:18.000]  But you were telling me just a few weeks ago when we talked, now seeing the whole trial, we'll talk about that after the break, seeing the trial and the cover-up and the corruption and how scared they are of this info coming out.
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  I mean, that right there is the proof of the guilt.
[13:21.000 --> 13:33.000]  Yeah, well, all of it is. It's one piece at a time, putting the puzzle together. There are a lot of pieces and, you know, I didn't even believe it initially until the pieces started coming together.
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  And to me, there's no other explanation right now. None. It's not possible.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  So, you know, people, they...
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  We're going to break in a moment. I mean, continue. Tell us what's coming up after the break.
[13:47.000 --> 13:55.000]  Now that you saw the trial as a lawyer, what you witnessed, he called you. You predicted this, I remember on my show, as the only witness.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  You said, I wonder if he'll call me as a witness and use me as leverage.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  Then he does call you as the only witness. Then they give him the plea bargain deal. Then he drops you as the witness, obviously.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  I mean, this is like out of a Hollywood movie.
[14:06.000 --> 14:15.000]  It should totally be a Hollywood movie, but again, it never will be for obvious reasons because the government and media try and cover it up.
[14:15.000 --> 14:26.000]  But yeah, you know, I have a lot of questions about the plea deal because he got nothing in return and pleaded to a mandatory life sentence in prison without parole.
[14:26.000 --> 14:35.000]  Nobody does that, Alex. So, what was he promised or how was he threatened to make that plea deal?
[14:35.000 --> 14:43.000]  You know, McVeigh, his supposed accomplice, Nicholl, signed a sworn affidavit and we've confirmed separate parts of it from other witnesses,
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.000]  that McVeigh was a U.S. government agent, was told he was setting up militias, thought it was a bombing sting.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  When the bombing was going to go forward, he threw a fit.
[14:53.000 --> 14:59.000]  So they just set him up and they told him they'd kill his whole family if he spoke out.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  Maybe there's something like that going on here. You know, I don't know, but I'm just saying the plea deal stinks.
[15:05.000 --> 15:11.000]  I don't know why it happened, but it happened five days after he said that he was going to call me as his only witness.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  And he takes a plea deal with nothing in return.
[15:15.000 --> 15:24.000]  He reads a statement that sounded like it was written by somebody at the Pentagon that used words that I don't even think he knew what he was saying.
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  You know, it was the perfect propaganda statement that he made when he took his plea deal, if you ask me.
[15:31.000 --> 15:39.000]  And the propaganda, the sophisticated packaging, the PR rollout is always the signature of a false flag.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  For those that don't know, The New York Times and CBS News in 1993 reported that the FBI did cook the bomb, train the drivers,
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.000]  give them the detonators, and order the bombing of the World Trade Center using two low-grade moron mentally ill people.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  And that could also be what this is.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  And the total, of course, looks drugged most of the time.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  We'll discuss what this means straight ahead and the new patsies they're setting up.
[16:00.000 --> 16:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[16:09.000 --> 16:15.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[16:15.000 --> 16:20.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  Three, e-foods uses only safe, healthy ingredients.
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  Number two, I have my own food supply and don't depend on the grocery store.

[20:24.000 --> 20:30.000]  I'm here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 central.
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.000]  That'd be 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 mountain.
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  Coming up, Jim Mars is going to be with us here on location
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  at the historic and beautiful Lakewood Theater in Dallas, Texas.
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  And unfortunately, this place only holds 800 people.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  It happened again every event I've ever had sold out.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  I'm going to be given a speech,
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Blueprint to Defeat the New World Order.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  And I am also going to be premiering a film.
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  And Jim Mars is going to be speaking.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  And then I'm going to be in Orlando next week.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  And those tickets, that venue holds over 1,000.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  I've only got a couple hundred left.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  Find out more at infowars.com forward slash events.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  I also have coming up David Sarding,
[21:18.000 --> 21:21.000]  who was one of the big stars of the reality TV show,
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  Preppers, Doomsday Preppers.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  And he went to the doctor and had medical problems.
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  They said, your guns are now confiscated.
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  They're taking veterans' guns.
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  They're taking people's guns who have surgery.
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  They're saying, well, you might get depressed.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  So we're going to go ahead and take your guns.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  So now when you get sick, they take your guns here
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  in Land of the Slave, Home of the Coward,
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.000]  until we stand up and say no to it.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  Of course, there's no law saying that,
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  but they still do it because it's a criminal
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  out of control government that wants a victim disarmament.
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  Now, we've only got about 10 minutes in this segment.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  I'm going to try to shut up and give him the floor.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  But when I think about the bizarreness of the story,
[21:53.000 --> 21:56.000]  Kurt Haskell, survivor of the underwear bombing with your wife,
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  you witness it all, the weird guy videotaping it.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  They land the plane, take you off, say there's a bomb threat.
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  They have their other agents on the plane.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  It's like out of a James Bond movie.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  And then you say you saw him get him on the aircraft.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  Then they admit the government helped get him on the aircraft.
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  But let's not discuss that.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  And now tell folks what you talked about
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  in your victim's statement and other points
[22:19.000 --> 22:23.000]  that you think are important here on the record, Kurt Haskell.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  Sure.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  Well, if you're a victim of a crime,
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  you get to make what's called a victim impact statement.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  You basically have to say how the crime affected you
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  physically, emotionally, or financially.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  And you can basically talk about whatever you want
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  in advance to the crime.
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  So Judge Edmonds, however, usually they're unlimited,
[22:45.000 --> 22:49.000]  but Judge Edmonds limited us to five minutes per passenger only.
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  So I had to really make it compact.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  So that's kind of what I did.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  And I wanted to write it out ahead of time
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  because I thought if I was just going off the top of my head,
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  I might say some things that would give me in trouble.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  My speech was pretty infuriating to the judge anyway,
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  even my pre-prepared one.
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  But I think if I went up top of my head,
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.000]  I might have started yelling at the prosecution or the judge
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  or something.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  So I wanted to write it out.
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  But basically, I just went through some of the things
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  I mentioned here and a few other points.
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  Like I was at a hearing where the prosecution indicated
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  it didn't want to give any of the evidence
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  to stand by attorney chambers because then a passenger
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  cuts the pin of the evidence from him
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  because he didn't have attorney and client privilege
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  and use it to sue the government.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  And they said they were concerned about being sued.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  So I brought up in my statement,
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  why is the government concerned about being sued in this case?
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.000]  What are they hiding?
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  So I brought that up.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  Now I brought up the fact that I went to the jury questioning
[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  hearings where they're questioning all the jurors
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  and that Judge Edmonds kept asking them if you realize
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  that sometimes the media lies to you
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  and chambers kept asking them.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  You think after you look at the evidence,
[24:17.000 --> 24:20.000]  you'll be able to tell whether something is a bomb or not.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  Just things like that.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  One thing after another after another after another
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  that shows that, yeah, this was indeed an intentional plot.
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Along with us sitting on the plane after it landed
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  with pieces of a bomb everywhere, nobody caring,
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  no one checking for our safety,
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  even though when Umar got off the plane,
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  he said there was another bomb on board, nobody cared,
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  nobody checked anywhere.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  You were just props to roll out the naked body scanners
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  so that the outgoing head of Homeland Security,
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  Lord Chertov, can make some money.
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  The guy that ordered the naked body scanners
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  who then went to work for the company to get the payoff.
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  We're pawns in a big chess game.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  Nobody cared about us at all.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  But, you know, looking back, it's pretty obvious
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  that they knew there weren't any concerns
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  because it was a defective bomb.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  They knew it was a defective bomb.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  They knew there weren't any accomplices
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  other than the ones in U.S. government.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  They knew there weren't any other bombs on board,
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  even though Umar said there was as he got off.
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  And they knew we weren't in any danger
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  with pieces of the bomb sending everywhere
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  as passengers trampled through it when we got off the plane.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  So, you know, looking back at it,
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  I think it's very clear what went on, at least to me.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  And, you know, I said that in my victim impact statement,
[25:37.000 --> 25:41.000]  and Judge Edmonds was not happy with me.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  I was done with it, and she scowled at me,
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  and then she said,
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  my wife, Lori, had the next statement after I did,
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  and she said,
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Ms. Haskell, I'm sure you're not going to say anything
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  about a government conspiracy like your husband just did
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  before you get up here, kind of intimidating her,
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  which I think was wild.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  Have you ever heard of a judge admonishing a victim
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  before they have their statement?
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  Never. Not only that.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  I've never heard of that.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  Never. It's totally unheard of.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  Not only that, she never said anything like that to Umar.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  And over two years of the trial,
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  and I went to almost all the hearings,
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  she never talked like that to him at all.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  But that's how mad she was at me for spilling the beans.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  Yeah, you're saying it's all theater,
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  it's all a matrix, it's all a hoax,
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  and they don't like that.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  It's kind of like it was even on the Discovery Channel years after.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  When I was first, in about 97,
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  I've been on the air a few years, told by police officers,
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  who I've interviewed on air with their names,
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  who the FBI came to their houses
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  and said, we'll kill you and your family
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  if you talk about what witnesses told you,
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  which was FBI agents planting bombs with ATF agents
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  inside the Oklahoma City Building.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  And I've had the cops on.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  They'd even threaten them in the police station,
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  they'd come in and say, we'll kill you and your wife.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  The cops on, like Mr. Browning, the canine sergeant,
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  he's like, you're going to kill me and my wife.
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  They're like, yeah, we're going to kill you.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  And that's just how this works,
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  because they just killed a bunch of kids in a daycare center.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  Why not? Why not go all the way here?
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  I mean, you know, kill 3,000 on 9-11.
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  But I was told this by police officers and others in like 97,
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  and I still couldn't believe it.
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  And then it was even in the LA Times
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.000]  that the government confiscated 20-plus videotapes
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  showing the other bombers of Oklahoma City.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  And we're suppressing it.
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.000]  And that the ATF, same thing the police had told me,
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  had practiced six months before Oklahoma City
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  in New Mexico at a testing range,
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  blowing up a rider truck,
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  with rider on the side with fuel oil in it.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  I mean, how much more obvious does this have to get, Kurt?
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  I mean, they're doing this to be able to take our rights
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  and get giant budgets and ship guns into Mexico
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  to then blame the Second Amendment with fast and furious.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  They got caught there, killed over 2,000 people,
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  the Mexican government says,
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  killed three cops, two border patrol here at least.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  They're caught. Nobody gets in trouble, Kurt.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  That's a false flag where they got caught, Kurt.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  You're right. And this one is too.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  You know, but you're totally right.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  What do we do about it?
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  But the other problem is the media.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  The mainstream media is a massive, massive problem in this
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  because they just won't report it.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  You know, I saw it the other day when I was in court.
[28:26.000 --> 28:49.000]  They should have blasted me.
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.000]  A little over a year ago,
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.000]  I began to do a lot of research into why,
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving.
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.000]  And my research led me to a well-known fact
[29:10.000 --> 29:13.000]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves,
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  fight off cancer and be healthy.
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  and discovered Young Jevity.

[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  And the number one reason I promote eFood's direct
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.000]  is they build special offers just for my listeners.
[32:44.000 --> 32:48.000]  Folks, don't wait. Get prepared now. We all need to be self-sufficient.
[32:48.000 --> 32:53.000]  Call eFood's direct at 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Jones Special.
[32:53.000 --> 32:57.000]  Call eFood's direct at 800-409-5633
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  or eFoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[33:01.000 --> 33:05.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:05.000 --> 33:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:09.000 --> 33:15.000]  I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads, I did ride.
[33:15.000 --> 33:19.000]  Oh, I love me some highwaymen.
[33:19.000 --> 33:23.000]  Many a young maid lost her bobbles to my trade.
[33:23.000 --> 33:27.000]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on me.
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.000]  I was a highwayman. Along the coach roads, I did ride.
[33:30.000 --> 33:33.000]  Oh, I love me some highwaymen.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  Many a young maid lost her bobbles to my trade.
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.000]  The bastards killed me.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five.
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.000]  But I am still alive.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  I was a sailor.
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  I was a sailor. Good old Chris Christoverson does this line.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  But Austin's own Willie Nelson was just doing the intro.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  We're coming up here in a moment and then we're going to get Jim Mars in studio
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  or on location, I should be more accurate.
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  Here in Dallas, Texas, where I'm about to speak to a capacity crowd.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  You know, it's always sad to turn away people.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  There's like a line of people out there with the tickets sold out.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  And I think they're going to let some of them in standing room only.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  But I should have got a bigger venue. But I just love this theater.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  I grew up in Dallas just down the street from here and came and saw like
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  movies like Dumbo and stuff when they'd re-air old Disney movies.
[34:34.000 --> 34:39.000]  You know, I wish the world was all happy like Dumbo flapping around with his ears.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  I wish the Federal Reserve wasn't private.
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  I wish pigs did fly.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  But the New World Order is in charge and we've got to change that.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  Finishing up with Kurt Haskell.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  Kurt, I want to get you on during the week if you can for a full hour.
[34:51.000 --> 34:52.000]  I know you couldn't come on Friday.
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  You were busy with clients and people as a lawyer.
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  But give out your website and in two minutes closing statement
[35:01.000 --> 35:07.000]  on what people need to know about the underwear bombing, the Christmas Day bombing.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  Sure. Well, you can read my blog.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  I've been blogging about this incident since it happened.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  Haskellfamily.blogspot.com.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  You'll have to go all the way back to Christmas Day 09 and read forward
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  between all of our other posts.
[35:22.000 --> 35:23.000]  It's just a family blog.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  It's not about the underwear bomb or specifically.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  So keep that in mind.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  The other aspect that we haven't really touched on a lot with the underwear
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  bomber is the complicity of the media.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  This is a huge problem that the media just won't report the story.
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  You know, if they did, there would be people outraged over this.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  Millions of people and the sort of thing would probably stop.
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  Yeah, the watchdog isn't there so the Crooks in government can get away with bloody murder.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  Right. And a good example was on Thursday when I made my victim impact statement.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  There were only five of us that made victim impact statements
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.000]  and three of them spoke very, with very thick accents.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  I could hardly understand them.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  The fourth one was my wife, Lori, whose statement didn't have a lot of facts in it
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  because she was intimidated by the judge's statement right before she got up there
[36:13.000 --> 36:19.000]  and mine where I just ripped the government, ripped the media for not reporting on the story.
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  But if you look at the media articles about me, hardly anything's mentioned
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  or they'll say that. What about a judicial complaint against the judge
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.000]  for a victim, your wife, just a few rows away from his firecracker bomb
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  and then she's intimidated from not giving her statement by this judicial tyrant?
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  I think she's actually going to file one. She wrote one up last week.
[36:40.000 --> 36:45.000]  I don't know if she's going to file one. She's pretty irritated over it.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  But yeah, the media is a huge problem. You know, I hardly anyone reported on it.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  I talked to them afterward. I hardly appear anywhere.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  You know, one of them had the nerve to ask me,
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  why did you feel the need to make that statement in open court today?
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  And I said, are you kidding me because you never report any of this?
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  Anyway, that's just my question.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  You're not supposed to talk about what's really going on.
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  You're supposed to, oh, it's in all the federal courts the government ships the narcotics in
[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  and ships guns into Mexico, but we're going to only talk about the gun part, not the drug part.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  I mean, sure, it's in federal court, but you don't discuss the fact that the government's really a mafia
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.000]  why they might come after us. We've all got to bend over to whatever they say,
[37:24.000 --> 37:28.000]  because that's what America is about. Kurt, thank you so much.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  We'll talk to you next week if you can do it.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  Anytime, Alex. Glad to be on.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  Glad to have you. Okay, there goes Kurt Haskell and we're going to dial up the Skype
[37:36.000 --> 37:42.000]  because the audio is better for our radio listeners and for video viewers at prisonplanet.tv.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  David Sardy and Doomsday Preppers.
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  Government hordes food, government hordes water, government hordes giant stockpiles of nuclear weapons
[37:52.000 --> 37:58.000]  and biological weapons, and that's reasonable and good to have a 20-year food supply
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  and underground reactors, underground reservoirs and giant armored mountains
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.000]  like Mount Weather and Cheyenne Mountain and Colorado Springs and all the rest of it.
[38:06.000 --> 38:12.000]  But if you have a fallout shelter or a storm shelter for hurricanes or tornadoes,
[38:12.000 --> 38:20.000]  if you even dare attempt in any way to have firearms and a year's supply of food
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  and canned some stuff like our forefathers just 50 years ago were doing,
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  forget forefathers just 50 years ago, that was standard, it is bizarre behavior.
[38:28.000 --> 38:34.000]  You can go to communities against terrorism, subsection of FBI.gov.
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.000]  There's literally hundreds of flyers they put out and they tell repair people and they're in your house.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  Do they have ammo reloading equipment? Do they have storable food?
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  Did you see an arsenal of guns as if...
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000] ...
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000] ...
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000] ...
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000] ... underground railways and all these systems that are admitted.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  But we, if we try to be prepared, we are evil.
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  We are bad. It is crazy. I mean, I was crazy 13 years ago with economists on the year
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.000]  warning of the end of the Glass-Steagall Act and the derivatives would be used
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  to implode our economy and basically bring in a world government.
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.000]  And of course now they've announced world government run by the megabanks that sold us the derivatives.
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.000]  It's in the Economist magazine, Reuters, AP, Bandkai Moon called for it two weeks ago.
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  But I'm still the bad man. I'm still the bad man. See, because being proven right
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  in America and worldwide, that's what's wrong.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  If you're one of these CNBC liars giving you bad stock picks all day and wrong about 85% of the time,
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.000]  that's good. Being bad is being right, you see.
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  So they have these shows, they try to pick eccentric people out and then try to make it look
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.000]  crazy to prepare. And they've got executive orders to confiscate from hoarders.
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  They call more than one week of food under executive orders.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  Look it up. Just type in executive order, outlaw hoarding of food.
[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  It'll come up. It's been reissued more than 20 times because each new president
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  has to reissue it or reissue a variance on it. It's been going on since Kennedy.
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  And sometimes they reissue changes every year on it. So it's more than 20 times they've changed it.
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.000]  But it's all there. Takeover of communications, takeover of all agriculture,
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  confiscation of all food, confiscation of all firearms.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  It's all on the books. On the books.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  But our next guest is one of the most popular individuals on the hit.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  And I mean hit. Everybody I know talks about it. I don't really watch a lot of
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  mainline TV, so I've only seen clips online. But everyone out there talks about
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  Doomsday Hoarders on the CIA run
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  History Channel, or not History Channel, Nat Geo, same thing.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  So National Geographic, and he's on there.
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.000]  And a week ago he put out articles in YouTube saying help me. I went to the doctor
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  and they took my guns. And I've actually seen cases in the news.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  We're going to him here in a moment where you have heart surgery
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  and they say we think you might be depressed. Go on Prozac.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  And when you say no, they say well that's mental illness, not believing your doctor.
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  We're taking your guns. Or sometimes the government just
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.000]  seizes you and even takes your property. They don't just have CPS that grabs
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  kids coming out of file services. They also
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  have these elder service people. And I'm not saying everybody
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  in the bureaucracy is evil, but the overall driving force is. But here he is.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  I see cases in the news. They admit after Clinton left office,
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  89,000 veterans had their right to Second Amendment taken because they collapsed in
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  Vietnam or got shot and they just added their file, post-traumatic stress disorder,
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.000]  even though they didn't even have it. No judge, no jury, not even 68 gun control acts
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.000]  says that they lost their Second Amendment. And so
[41:58.000 --> 42:02.000]  I talked to so many vets to go to buy their grandson at 22. They're 60 year old
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  Vietnam veteran. And they're like sorry, you can't buy it. He goes, but I have no criminal record.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  Call the FBI. They call them. They go, we got some mental illness in your
[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  Army file, your Marine Corps file, your Navy file.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  I know clerks from the military
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  never even in combat who can't own guns now. Side issue, let's
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  go to the mind criminal, the evil person, the thought criminal that would dare
[42:26.000 --> 42:30.000]  try to store food, David Sardy. Good to have you on with us.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  We're going to break in a moment, but just give us a taste of what's coming up.
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  Tell us what, hold on, there's the break. Again, I'm on the road,
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  don't have my clock in front of me, my trusty atomic clock. We're going to go to David
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  Sardy right here. We'll do two segments with him. And maybe even longer, because Jim Mars
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  just got here, but there's a Mexican food restaurant next door. He's here with his wife and family.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  He's like, can I get some enchiladas? I'm like, you know what, enchiladas
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  and cold beer, that supersedes a radio show.
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  Go over there and pound down some yummys. I had tried everything.
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging,
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.000]  but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.000]  minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that,
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great products at infowarsteam.com
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  37 pounds in just two months.
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.000]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarsteam.com
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  and to order just three of their products and you
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.000]  almost immediately. Start your journey to health and wellness today
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  infowarsteam.com
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be
[44:10.000 --> 44:14.000]  glad you were wearing Diamond Gussets.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond Gusset Jeans
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality. Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  combined Gusset Comfort with Kevlar Protection so you could ride all day
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  with confidence. Order yours at Gusset.com
[44:56.000 --> 45:12.000]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it. Others don't.
[45:26.000 --> 45:30.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog is easy

[45:54.000 --> 45:58.000]  Calvin on the Web at 5starsoap.com
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  A little over a year ago
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  I began to do a lot of research into why even though I had a pretty good size meal
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in
[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.

[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  tell us what happened to you my friend. Well just I heard you talking about
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  the veteran stuff just I don't know if you can see
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  that right there. That's called an honorable discharge. I do have
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  one of those. But anyway
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  I'm gonna try to edit down this
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  last year back in say November
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  I thought I was having a heart attack. I was having chest pains, felt like I was
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  suffocating. So I went to my doctor
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  and he referred me to this cardiologist. So that cardiologist
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  sent me to some tests at a hospital. A month
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  and a half goes by and I haven't heard nothing from this guy. So I called him up
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  made an appointment. I went there and he said well they
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  didn't see nothing wrong with my heart and I told him I said well whatever was wrong
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  you know I said look this was you know I felt like I was suffocating
[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  and this was the closest I ever came to feel like committing suicide.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  Well you know that started it off. He said you're gonna commit suicide.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  I said no I'm not gonna commit suicide. I'm not suffocating.
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.000]  I said you know suffocation you know drowning and stuff like that.
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  He said it was a figure of speech. It was a figure of speech. Right.
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  If I was you know it's like the people that jumped out of the World Trade
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  Center when it was burning you know what you're gonna burn you're gonna jump. You know you got a choice.
[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  But anyway I said no. You told him I'm not gonna commit suicide.
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  Right. I told him flat out I'm not. And he says well you know when we could stick these tubes
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  in you know he's gonna do some kind of trach and make it so you
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  could breathe. I says you know if I have to live with tubes in me I just assume
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  you know not get treated and go on. And well then he said well
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  that sounds like suicidal to me. So I said no it's not
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  and then he says well you know he mentioned that it wasn't my decision
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  and me being a libertarian that flew all over me.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  So I proceeded to get. Oh not your decision. You will take the
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  vaccines. You will eat GMO. You will take the fluoride. You will do
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  what the little secret police officer just like Hitler hired
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  all the doctors to work for him. Oh yeah I even said I said
[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  look everybody at one time or another thinks about it. And he said well I've never
[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  thought about it. And I called him basically told him he was full of donkey poo.
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  So anyway
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  you know that went on and finally he said he was full of Bill Clinton.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  Yeah I thought he said you need to go
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  talk to somebody at the emergency room. I said I don't have time
[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  you know I can't afford that emergency room. I got animals to feed on the farm. You said
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  you're full of Janet Reno. You're full of Janet Napolitano.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  He says get over there to the emergency room and he said you're full of the federal government
[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  go ahead. Yeah and then you know I said look I don't have time for this.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  I have animals. I got dogs locked up in the house and
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  you know and everything else. So I went out in the hall and I
[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  heard him calling the sheriff's office. I'd ski daddled and
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  I went home and maybe again they're just looking
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  because the government's hurting them into spies and coffee shop people are told
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  folks that are buying cash call the FBI on them that's an actual FBI flyer. I'm not
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  joking folks got a video up on info wars dot com about it. My point here is
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  you're like simply saying I'm having chest pains. God this is horrible. It's like maybe
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  I want to kill myself. It's so horrible. You're not going to kill yourself. No it's a figure of speech.
[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  We're going to stick tubes down you and trach you. Well that's crazy. I'm walking around
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  here in your hospital. I'm saying I've got pain here and then he's like well
[52:02.000 --> 52:06.000]  this is just the way it is and look I've had allergy attacks so bad when I
[52:06.000 --> 52:10.000]  made a mistake and rode a bike long distance like 20 miles
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  about five years ago with my buddy. I went on this long distance
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  20 miles a lot of it mountain biking while the
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  cedar was popping or the mountain junipers what it really is we call it cedar
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  and I'm driving home and I feel like I'm having a heart attack.
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  I can't breathe then I get a migraine and I went to the doctor
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  the next day and they said you had a complete allergy attack. This has
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  happened to a lot of people after I explained I've been exercising. I
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  smelled so much of that cedar that it just
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  coated everything including my lungs and everything but I guess I deserve to have my
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  guns taken continuing so you go out there in the hall he is now
[52:50.000 --> 52:54.000]  calling the sheriff. Right well I heard
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.000]  about the sheriff so I left and I went home
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  and anyway about 10 minutes after I got here
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.000]  the sheriff's deputies come up
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  and the logic of sending somebody
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  with a gun after somebody that's going to commit suicide fails me
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  but you know I went out
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  there and talked to him and they told me that I was going to have to come
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  with them and he said well you know you go to the hospital
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  they'll turn you loose and he'll even give me a ride back home.
[53:30.000 --> 53:34.000]  So I said all right let's get this straightened out. So they didn't
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  cuff me or nothing they put me in the car and they took me to the hospital. Well I talked
[53:38.000 --> 53:42.000]  to this other woman I guess she was a doctor after sitting there
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  for about an hour and you know talked to her
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  and I signed an agreement saying look I'm not going to commit suicide and all like that
[53:50.000 --> 53:54.000]  so an hour more goes by and then
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  you know I was like hey wait a minute you know what's going on here
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  and then I said well look I'm a prisoner I considered myself a prisoner
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  and I stopped cooperating so I said no you're not getting no more blood pressures
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  I'm not talking to you no more. I want an attorney
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  and as soon as I said that that's when they put me
[54:14.000 --> 54:18.000]  in the mental institution at McFarland for observation
[54:18.000 --> 54:22.000]  and every again just like the Soviets and the
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  Nazis and the communist Chinese every dictatorship in the last hundred years
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  has used the mental system as a way to get around
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  due process that everybody fought for and you know there's a crazy guy
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  down the street corner who thinks he's Joan of Arc they let him run around
[54:38.000 --> 54:42.000]  with feces running down their legs drinking slits malt liquor all day
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  they could care less if you commit suicide they could care less if you're really crazy
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  they use it to harass people politically and I've seen this so many
[54:50.000 --> 54:54.000]  times so continue next you get your guns taken correct
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.000]  well no they took my rights I found out
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.000]  about it by accident I mean I just got
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  a letter saying I had to surrender my handgun permit
[55:06.000 --> 55:10.000]  but I found out about it because I had been saving
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  up for a Glock 21 and I got out a week later I had the money
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.000]  I got my YouTube money and I said I'm gonna go get my Glock
[55:18.000 --> 55:22.000]  I got turned down so then I did
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  an immediate appeal right there as soon as I got turned down and that's when I found out
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  about the paper you have been declared
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  the federal 68 gun control act doesn't give them the power to do that
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.000]  you had not been adjudicated mentally ill or committed
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.000]  but they just color of law do it it's felons under the
[55:42.000 --> 55:46.000]  68 gun control act that can own guns but it's just like color of law how they
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  ban importation of guns to this country it's not a law but like Obama
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  promised to do to cerebrating two years ago he said don't worry I'm gonna get their guns
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  under the radar like shipping guns to Mexico to blame the second
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.000]  amendment well basically I was I was put in there I feel
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  they put me in there because I made them mad because
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  I said I was a being a prisoner and I called them a bunch of
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  basically I told them they were Gestapo at the hospital oh we're no we're doctors
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  they say you're not a prisoner I said can I go
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  they said no I said I'm a prisoner and you're keeping me here against my will
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  so you know they take people's kids that don't take vaccines at birth even though there's
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  no law there no they are a bunch of a bunch of authoritarian scum
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  I have witnessed it myself they might be a nice person to play golf with
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  they're gonna church with but they're on these little power trips and our rights mean Jack
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  diddly squat to them well see that's when they
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  wanted you know when I got to the hospital I got this other little doctor that wants to
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  to give me these things called zebra
[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  hold on whatever it is it's a ant psychotropic
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  drug and I refuse that so that was another black mark because I refuse
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  you gotta take their deadly chemical weapons you're evil
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  by the way those psychotropic drugs on the insert say they make
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  you crazy and make you commit suicide oh that's what I said
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  yeah I got the print out of the drug immediately
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  from the nurses station and I read all the stuff and that's one of the things it says
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  but see because you're the type that would read a drug insert
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  you're the bad man you're the terrorist you're the problem

[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  I want to try to help you out as best we can I want to get you back on the show
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  for a full hour so you can really break all this down and take calls and hear
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  from other victims of this extrajudicial medical
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  tyranny but the four or five minutes we've got left with you you've got the floor
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  where are you now what else happened you've been calling for help
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  you haven't gotten any your second amendment just gone there's no judge there's
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  no jury the FBI incident check won't let you have your second amendment
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  well I'm in the middle of a bunch of appeals I talked to a
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  gun owners of America attorney and he said what
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  I should do by myself and then I got this other letter from the
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  state see there was a bunch of petitions going to the
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  governor somebody else one of my viewers started it and
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  apparently it got the governor's attention which then sent me immediately
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  to the Department of Safety which then immediately sent out a letter
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  asking for my carry permit now I've had a carry permit since they began
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  I mean I've I've never been in it by the way you don't need a permit for your
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  right to own a gun no it was the the
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  thought behind the permit thing was they just wanted people to know
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  you know in other words you had to go out and show that you could actually shoot one
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  and hit the target that's what it was sure now I understand all that
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  but it's like where is it going now so
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  right now with that I just oh man it's going to be more expensive
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  than I thought I thought it was just going to be one of you know get an attorney
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  and we'll fight it and get me off the Knicks
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  well with this latest letter that means it's going to be at the federal and the state
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  and the local level so I want to it's going to be going through three separate
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  courts in order to fight this so now yeah no judge no
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  jury no conviction you're just and you weren't adjudicated as mentally ill
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  just some little control freak at a doctor's office
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  because you wouldn't let them cut your throat open and shove tubes down you
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  and you know who knows shove up what other places now the little
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  trendies have taken your second amendment yeah well they they've done that
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  and oh man it's it's probably more
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  than I can handle by myself I mean I listen listen we're going to get you back on
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  in the next few days on the big you know weekday show but this

[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  did say that needs to be done anybody that has a case similar to mine
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  needs to contact the gun owners of America because they said
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  that something you know this is something that's they have documented
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  happening before so they need well a gun
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  owners is saying they have documented or they haven't they have they apparently this
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  is an abuse of power that they know this happens all the time this is now
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  millions millions now kind of operative
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  in the background as a dog barks that's a sign of evil as well

[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  a minute well they're looking toward the front gate so they may
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  be giving me an alarm that the the goon squad is out there

[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  gnome straight ahead
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  www.silverlungs.com
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]  what we've got here is
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  failure to communicate
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  some man you just can't reach
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]  I know you get what we had here last week which is the way

[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  look at your young man fighting
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  look at your women crying
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  it's a young man dying
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  the way they've always done before
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000]  we're back live and Jim Mars is here with us on
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  location he was showing me what he bought at the Walmart
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  earlier they're selling little scissors part of the
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  new sacrament in America is that all the feminists chop their husbands
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  testicles off so they learn how to serve the new world order better
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  no every reporter has to have one of these
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  clip out clippings so you keep up with everything
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  and when people say how do you know that you go here I've got a news clip
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  exactly it's documented that was an attempted lame humor and I apologize to the family audience
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  out there I'm a little bit out of control Jim Mars
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  started his career as a crime reporter on the four star telegram
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  he's been covering the JFK assassination forever and on top of that
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  he wrote the book that was used as the primary tome for the hit
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  film JFK with Oliver Stone and he joins us
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  here at the Lakewood Theater in Dallas Texas this way you don't have to drive to Austin to be on the show
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  that's right so you're right here with us and I should be plugging our Dallas affiliate
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  which I'll do actually in the next segment
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  you want me to tell you how many RFID readers and photo cameras I passed coming down
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000]  at 30 how many well I was counting them there's like
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  about 27 or 28 but 20 years ago when
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  you warned people about that it wasn't going to happen oh I was the conspiracy theorist
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  and of course world government wasn't going to happen now it's all public
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  and the very bankers that international bankers aren't going to get us
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  that's a conspiracy theory but now the big mega banks are taking over listen
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  30 or 40 years ago when I was working I worked with a guy
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  who was with PR advertising for some big banks and we used to
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  look about it he'd say listen when they send you that world bank card
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  don't take it you know and now we all
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  have one oh time magazine says the bank of the world and authoritarianism
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  but bankers these aren't dictators these are technocratic bankers
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  they're going to run everything and they're going to raise your taxes but they care about you
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  I don't think so but they but the big bank big six banks
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  fund eugenics and say they want to kill us I mean that's loving
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  they were just uncovering a big banking scandal over in
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  England right now and the guy got up in the house of lords and said
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  you know the amount of money we're talking about here could actually provide basic health
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  care to every man woman child in America for 12 years
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  that's how much money folks is flowing out of this country
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  the wealthy west funds the mega corporations world government our tax
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  money isn't just corporate welfare it's empire welfare
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  and we don't even get the booty no I mean even if you were immoral it's like
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  you're not you're paying for it you're not getting anything back no they get the booty we just
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  get the boot exactly that'd be a good bumper sticker let me bring this up
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  what is it like for you fighting the new order now for 30 plus years on
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  very prominent all over every history channel discovery channel ABC
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  you mean you're the go-to guy half the time I walk around the office they'll have some
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  history channel or discovery channel show on there's Jim Mars what is it like
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  to go from all that guy that's a conspiracy theorist to now secret arrest of
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  citizens military on the streets license plate reading cameras world government
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  but we're right about it all but still we're bad I mean how do you
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  describe that that's exactly right well I've been I've been kind of on the cutting
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  edge all along because you know back in the mid 60s
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  I said hey the Kennedy assassination that's a big conspiracy oh you're just
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  a nut and then I said you know Vietnam this war it's going to end
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  badly oh you're just a nut hey I said Nixon's a crook he's not going to serve
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  out his term now you're just a nut and so it just goes on and on and on but
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  but when you stay ahead of the curve see now try to tell them hey they're
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  spraying us with chemtrails you know oh you're just a nut even though the
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  government admits but says it's a secret program but you're kooky to ask but
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  there is a program seven billion a year at least but don't discuss it and patents
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  that they sure but they don't discuss it but no we don't want to do that and then
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  you know try to talk about you can even go to 9-11 and there are the there's
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  the theory that some of those airplanes have been captured the computer
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  captured by remote control they don't have drones
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  you can't do that and now I go to the movies and see ads for the Air Force and
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  they're saying hey come to the Air Force you can sit down there Joe Kennedy's son died
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  in World War two in a remote control plane well yeah well he was
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  in the plane behind the big bomber they were using a cruise missile yeah remote controlling it
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  yeah didn't exist in 43 though that was in 43 in the 1980s I was
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  interviewing an airline pilot for a big boy in wide body jet and he said you know
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  my job's just redundant and I said what do you mean he said well the
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  computer flies the airplane he said I'm just there in case the computer
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  burned listen I want somebody to find this because I saw this live
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  on C-span and it was a New York City police press conference
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  with this weird sound board it's like cream
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  colored with holes in it behind them everybody knows what I'm talking about if you watch New York
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  press conferences and George W. Bush the president's come to New York the day after
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  he's given us you know we're going to get the people to knock these towers down speech and he gets up and he goes
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  don't worry we've got remote control and all the aircraft in the future
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  we're going to be able to stop him from doing this and actually somebody behind him reaches
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  up and jerks on his shirt and he goes oh but I mean I saw
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  this I know you did because what I have documented is that
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  early in 2001 months before 9-11 the head of British Airways
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  made a talk and said you know we don't have to worry about hijacking anymore
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  because we now have the ability to capture the onboard computers
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  and we can guide it into a safe landing regardless of what the crew
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  or the hijackers want and then later I found out they actually on those
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  two aircraft that were used they have the exact system was in place exactly
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  you know but of course that's just conspiracy theory right they don't have a remote control aircraft
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  the entire Air Force in eight years is going to be totally drowned but you know that doesn't exist
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  right but that doesn't exist well it's the difference between people who know
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  things and people who watch television I think that is the difference
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  of course we make television and we don't watch it but we are on television
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  right well you know what I'm talking about
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  somebody who comes back from home from work you know sits down they keep us on the
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  treadmill watch his CNN they're on that gerbil
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  Fox you know and then goes to bed things they've learned everything
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  and if they don't see it on CNN or Fox or read it in their local
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  syndicated newspaper then you know it can't be real
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  and yet all I have to do is look around and see what's going on
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  do I understand that now the TSA is starting to set up spot checkpoints
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  in Dallas remember me years ago I saw them on C-SPAN they always tell us
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  nine years ago they hadn't even made Homeland Security cabinet yet it was 2002
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  a few months before they made it an official agency
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  of the cabinet under executive power and they said
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  you're going to have to get TSA to get a job we're going to be on every street corner and it's going to be kind of a
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  federal force everywhere and we're going to train your police and they'll be threat
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  fusion centers they have all these corporate leaders there yes so I've been telling folks TSA is coming to your streets
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  they're now in every major city and I've seen newscasts where
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  you're driving down the road in Tennessee or Michigan and they actually grab your
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  knife out and grab your breath on the side of the highway it's a total act of submission
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  now answer me at this because it's all due to 9-11 and it's all due to the fear
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  of the terrorism right exactly how many terrorists
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  has the TSA caught they admit zero zero none
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  but the Dallas morning news says thank god they're helping forget 10th amendment
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  states rights they're going to be at all the dark stations now they're and they're going to have to
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  they're going to have to fill your generals well see then you can
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  using that same logic you could say that they're protecting us from the vampires
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  exactly have you seen the vampire around lately no
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  well yeah but she we're not sure we're not sure about
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  her she's a dumb beetle so see TSA has protected us
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  from vampires because we don't see any around well I should make the joke that
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  hey there could be a terrorist in a cornfield in South Dakota shin troops there
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  and now the government's saying oh yes anywhere we've got to protect you
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  so we've got to be everywhere that's right who protects us from them though
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  exactly who will watch the watchers and we're going to break in a moment and I want to take
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  some calls you know not in this next segment but the segments after that what is
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  because I never do pre-interviews you know this my friend what is front and center on
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  your radar screen when we come back to Jim Mars is going to have the floor
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  while I hit the latrine I'm joking I'll do that during the break
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  what is Jim Mars going to be covering that's a good question
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  I just need to take questions because there's so much going on
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  it's hard to pinpoint it you want to do that yeah I mean you know my big thing
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  is if we're really supposed to be so afraid of
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  worldwide well-financed well-heeled
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  deadly terrorist organization al-qaeda then the first thing it seems to be
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  that we should be doing is securing the border and yet
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  you probably saw the news film where they used the car jacked up the fence
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  there I want to hear about this when we get back
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team dot com but I want to point out
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  the three that have helped me lose

[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  and you said it was
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  the move to try to get us into a war with a ran
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  you know i mean they've been trying this since the bush administration everybody thought
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  oh that was
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  mama
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  and are we any better off no they're pushing for war too
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  in fact let me ask you alex and i know you know this
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  of all the possible republican candidates and democratic candidates
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  out there who's the only one that says maybe we shouldn't
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000]  go to war well he's the guy named gron poll
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000]  oh well you're not supposed to mention him he's a non-person
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  he can win even though he's number two or number three in all polls and gets 70 plus percent on the military
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  donations because the military doesn't like him and he gets more donations
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000]  from the military than anyone else during some of these debates are like how dare you
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  not want war how dare you hate our troops
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  the troops got it in fact but listen to this this tells us a lot
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  he's got the most campaign contributions and support from the army
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  the navy the air force but wait a minute according to the
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  campaign numbers the money coming from the department of defense
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  pentagon zero now doesn't that tell you something
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  oh yeah i saw those numbers so the foreign banks that run
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  military they know he's an american so he's the enemy that's right
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  but isn't it encouraging that the military is away they are and i
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  have recently been talking to that march happen today guys will you look up what's
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000]  happening with that dc march with the veterans marching what happened with that yes
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000]  i'm gonna ask the crew to look that up with what adam co catch we had him on want to cover that go ahead
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  well i want to just say this because i i would have an
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  urge from the united states army i've served okay i've been in military in fact
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]  thousand military intelligence which even then i thought was kind of
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  the economy of terms but what i want to say is is
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  that the oath of allegiance i took going into the
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  u.s. military was to serve and protect the constitution
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  of the united states against all enemies foreign
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  or domestic does that mean big foreign megabanks robbing us
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  why would in fact to me the the most
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  enemies we have today are domestic now the reason i bring this up alex is because
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  i've also seen the directives that have gone out to military people
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  couched in so many terms but basically saying
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  you should not participate in any of these demonstrations or any of these
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  marches that could be a violation of the uniform but obama obama
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000]  and a bush are allowed to have them ordered out to stand behind them at campaign speeches
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  right right the point though here is that in the
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  military you were sworn to defend the constitution the united states
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  and you're also told that you do not have to obey an illegal
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  order okay the constitution says we have freedom of
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  speech and in the military as long as it's not security connected you should
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000]  have freedom of speech you don't have it especially if you're off duty when you're
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  on duty you don't when you're off yeah so if you're ordered not to go participate
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]  in you're still in america just because you're in the military that's an illegal order
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  it is it's an illegal order because it violates the constitution of the united states
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  in the first amendment and your first obligation in the u.s. military
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  is defend the constitution of the united states and here's how they try to play that ignorance of the military
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000]  not just on saying as the navy put out don't go to this wrong ball demonstration
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  you'll be reprimanded incredible when they've always been told that's an illegal
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  order by the way folks guys and gals in military that's an illegal order
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000]  it is it violates the constitution which supersedes any
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]  other regulation or law marbury versus medicine they could
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  pass a law saying you can barbecue black children on the white house law
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  or whatever and it's it's it's illegal i don't care if you say you have a law
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  hitler had laws but it was pure bull but but expanding all those people
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  killed in the holocaust were done under the color of law that's right
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  judges ruled on it and they went right on it was
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  it was all there listen black people were slaves in this country
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  and then couldn't own guns under law and it was the one that they said blacks
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  weren't human tomorrow and were slaves i say your law is full of garbage that's right
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  because the constitution points out this doesn't give you your rights
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  it points out rights that are there and people criticize the founders that there was problems
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000]  up front it was those ideas that led to the
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  abolition of slavery that's right but expanding under law
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  they can't give troops experimental vaccines but they try to but they do it all the time
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  and the troops had to learn wait you're not allowed to give me an experimental shot so what if
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  you say it's an order the law says you can't do that again they try to keep the troops
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  like the public in the dark but the fact that ron paul supporters
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  in the military 70 plus percent that's got a scare of the system jim
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  well it makes me feel good because i'm hoping that means 70 percent
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000]  of our military which is there to defend the country is there to defend me
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  not the banks not the multinational corporations
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  but i've forgotten that number the department of defense zero all those big defense
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  contractors zero no they don't want ron paul and by the way
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000]  the next time somebody tells you well you know i kind of like
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  what ron paul says but you know he won't be elected and i don't want to waste my vote
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000]  you tell them listen jerk if you'd actually vote for him
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  then if all those people who said well i like what he says but he's unelectable
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  would actually vote for him he'd probably get elected well that's that mind game
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  that we're going to say who you can vote for exactly
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  and i'll tell you what and here's the whole thing everyone who's listening
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  to this you've got to take it on yourself you can you know you can't just
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  count on alex take care of everything you can't count on me you can't count on
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  anybody you can only count on yourself and what do you do you've got to
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  wake your fellow citizens up and i don't mean preaching to them because that's
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  not going to do any good but start asking them questions and just get them to thinking
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  and just say like you know i mentioned i think in the last
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000]  quarter say say wait a minute if we're supposed to be so afraid
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000]  of this international terrorist organization
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000]  that is trying to slip weapons of mass destruction into our country
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  and is so evil then how come they haven't done
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  one solid thing to secure the border get them thinking about
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  that wait a minute well why haven't they and that's because let me tell you folks
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  this is where the new world order is kind of tripped up themselves they don't
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  want a secure border they want open borders so they flood this
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  country and dilute the population get us all conflicted fighting with each other
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  so that they push through their agenda that's for Balkanization
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  a minute plan the Balkanization of America absolutely so
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  they don't want to secure border and yet they want us all fearful
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  of this international terrorist organization so wait a minute you can't have both
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  if the terrorist organization is real then we need to secure the
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  border and if it's not real then we can talk about loosening
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  the border but there's no discussion of that we're supposed
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  to believe in these two you know totally opposite themes
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  it's ridiculous get people to think and ask them
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  about what he's supposed to brought down that third tower in New York on 9-11
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  and I guarantee in 9-10 they're gonna say what tower
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  you say well the Solomon brothers building and they're gonna say what
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  and then you say oh well you didn't know that another building fell down that afternoon
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000]  just search building 7 just go get on the internet go search building 7

[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why

[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals

[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  find out really if you want to really get horrified
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  then read my New York Times bestseller the rise of the fourth
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  right because that will tell you that how
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  yes we defeated the German military in world war two
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  we defeated the German nation but we didn't defeat the Nazis
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  in fact at the signing of the surrender papers that was the German
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  Wehrmacht army the Nazis were not even represented there
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  they never gave up in fact the same international
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  bankers that had bankrolled the bill to murder his Nazi
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  and created the third right they simply brought them all over here
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  with the help of the CIA with a paper clip and several other
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  programs thousands of them okay and rolled them into our military
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  industrial complex to head programs from NASA to CIA
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  to mind control to pharmaceuticals
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  why do you think they're putting fluoride in the drinking water my son has
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  a children's history book on the Nazis like I meant to bring it for the speech
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  tonight he is back in the hotel my wife god bless her she's
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  sick or something I don't feel well but the point is in there it says
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  the Nazis would tell people I gotta look this up I've never even seen this but it was like a mainline
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  big scholastic book the biggest publisher in the world
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  they said the Nazis would give people shots saying it was a vaccine it was really to kill them
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  I'm like what do you think is going on today did you know that about the Nazis?
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  I didn't know that tell us briefly we're gonna call them
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  well they had a program where they were targeting
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  in the German it translated to life not worth
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  life or not worth living and they would go for people
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  that they considered defective mentally physically whatever and
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  they would inject them tell them to give them medicine and just kill them off
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  that's what they're doing to us exactly except they see they learn
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  this isn't a children's book I learned some every day well they said they would say we're giving you a vaccine
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  and kill them and of course when they send them to the camps and they tell them strip off we're gonna put you in
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  this little room and we're gonna delouse you you know of course they threw in
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  the cyclone bead gas you know and and see you
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  you don't kill a lot of people at once by telling them we're gonna kill you and they
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  they'll have them fight back or something so it's always for your good
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  this film I'm in a premiere tonight I've been so busy
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  I just got finished a few days ago I haven't thought up the right name yet for it to describe it
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  but it's all about democide which is in the university as your professor yourself
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  but the public doesn't know about it and democide is
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  death by government 260 plus million last century killed by government
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  well you know if you want to go back to the United States government
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  and go back to the Native Americans and come forward to the
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  Philippine insurrection and then it would just keep going you know
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  we've killed more people than Hitler supposedly did
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  so I don't know it's really something people just need
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  to wake up and get to their senses we're good people the United States
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  gives more to charity than all the other nations in the world we're gullible put together
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  but we're gullible and we're naive because we were the good guys we think we're perfect now
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  yeah and it's just not the case let's go to phone calls you ready
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  let's go to Sean in Arizona you're on the air with Jim Mars live
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  in Dallas Texas thanks Sean thank you Alex thank you
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  Mr. Mars thanks for everything you've done over the past 50 years pertaining to
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  the JFK conspiracy but what I have to say today is a comment
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  from the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000]  that Mr. Hassel from Detroit was on I've been on that
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  flight and I want to share to you a couple quick facts first of all I was over
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  in Germany and I was told by my German host
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  that when we flew into Amsterdam from Bremen
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000]  Germany not to fiddle around with the Dutch authorities
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  they had the second toughest airport security in the world
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  behind the Israelis and they did racially
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  profile me and others
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  individually it was really something to watch and one on one
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  consultations on a dais and then they cut you loose
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  and what I witnessed and this was in May
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  Memorial Day weekend of 2003 we had an orange alert
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  at the time when I was cut loose from the one
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000]  consultation with the Dutch authorities I went
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  around the corner and every mid-east
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  looking person meaning Pakistan's East Indians
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  seeks with headdresses
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  we're all being searched there everyone there was no exception
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  everybody even 80 year old we had real security
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  they had naked body scanners at that airport and brought
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  him through he didn't even the US government got him to visa
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000]  he didn't have the other passport and that's what Haskell Saul was a guy with high enough
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  authority at the gate at the secondary check to say you will put him on
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  and then the government admits that was their guy that got him on
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  is that the point you're getting at? no wait Sean I want to ask you something
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  because it does sound like that was a very stringent security checkpoint
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  did they put their hand down your pants
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  no no completely professional I mean complete
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  here it's about the whole government and your God
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  we're going to have pot bellies grab your child's genitals here it's about domination
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  everyone who's listening this put their hand down your pants
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  this has nothing to do with security this has everything to do
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  with making the public passive and accepting of just about anything
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  exactly but to sort of finish your point so what is your point in the huge security
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000]  that you saw compared to what you just heard with Kirk Haskell with the US government
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000]  demanding they get this guy on the plane well the key is this Alex and you've already
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  said it and what the majority of our countrymen don't know
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  it was impossible for any terrorist to get
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  on the plane without cooperation from our people
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  because the Dutch were so good that they would have never allowed
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000]  that's the whole point here and I've known it for years ever since it happened
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  it's on record that after the Israelis they've got the most including naked body scanners
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  listen the underwear bomber was brought past all the security that was later confirmed
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  just like brought right past it all wait wait wait
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  two months one month after that there were congressional
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  hearings and there were people from the intelligence community who testified
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  to Congress under sworn testimony that the
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  State Department was going to decline this guy of visa
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  and our intelligence services said no let him
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  see you were driving in you missed it I had Haskell on he said it a month and a half before
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  it was in the news he saw it happen yeah exactly no it was on c-span
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  yeah no listen they run the click they're giving Al Qaeda control Libya and Syria
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000]  now and I mean come on man if you go but if you go back
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  to TSA wants to grope my family I can't fly but because Al Qaeda
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  but they give them whole countries and they right and if you'll go back to every single
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  terrorist big story from the Sears Tower in
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Chicago all the way down at the thick of it at the middle
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  of it you always find some government informant or some government
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  provocateur the whole thing the whole thing's a scam

[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  into why even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  and my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves

[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000]  what is the system you're talking about
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  grow gardener I need to get one
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  yeah you grow your own herbs, it's got a little grow light
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000]  they're shut down the omnis and shut down people with the lemon age stands
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.040]  I don't know if you can be trusted with a garden because you know they're
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:53.400]  and shut down people with the lemonade stands.
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.360]  I don't know if you can be trusted with a guard
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.960]  because you know they're starting to restrict them.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:59.360]  If you have inspections to make sure there's not drugs
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.040]  because you're guilty until proven innocent.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:01.880]  That's true.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.560]  Maybe I better not put any mint in the mint juleps
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.840]  I serve to people.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.080]  Oh yeah, don't do that.
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.400]  Hasn't been government approved.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.480]  Exactly.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:12.000]  Let's race through your calls here.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.480]  Jeff in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.320]  Go ahead.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:20.880]  I just had a quick question for Jim.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.640]  It's funny you brought up your books.
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:27.400]  I'm just racing through the end of the Rise of the Fourth
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.320]  Reich.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:31.800]  And I wondered if Jim could go over on page 207.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.400]  He talks about Otto Scorsese, the Nazis,
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.040]  and the Egyptian Gestapo, which is known as the Muslim
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.520]  Brotherhood, how it ties to the CIA director Alan
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.080]  Dulles, Richard Gellin, and how it's been done.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:46.680]  Oh yeah, no, no.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.440]  They run.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.520]  Listen, the Nazis, British Intel, our government,
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:51.960]  they run all the Muslim extremists.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:52.440]  Go ahead.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:53.200]  Exactly.
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:55.000]  And that's because they took them over
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.880]  at the end of World War II, because prior to them,
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.080]  the Muslim Brotherhood had been a Nazi-run organization.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.040]  So now we've got not only fanatical Muslims, but-
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.760]  Well, the Grand Imam, was that one
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:07.760]  was an actual Nazi?
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.080]  Oh yeah, and a big fan of Adolf Hitler.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.840]  And in fact, I had an uncle that
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:14.480]  served in the army in North Africa.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:16.560]  And he said they had as much trouble
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.160]  with the Muslim Brotherhood as they did with the Nazis.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.080]  I mean, they were fighting us over there, too.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.480]  See, nobody gets told about the truth of history.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.120]  We just get these little sound bites and-
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.040]  But they're the good guys.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.520]  They're putting them in charge now.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:29.000]  Oh yeah.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.840]  The TSA goes in your pants because they
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.120]  need to put them in charge.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:32.840]  That's right.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:33.920]  Exactly.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:36.480]  Making us safe, safe.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:37.360]  Wait a minute.
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:38.320]  Come on, folks.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.760]  Freedom has never been safe, clean, tidy.
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:41.320]  All right, great.
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.280]  Full.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:44.760]  Quick 30-second comeback, Jeff.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.920]  I just wanted to say, if anybody hasn't read
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:50.560]  Rise of the Fourth Reich, every page is a jaw dropper.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.400]  Recommended reading to know what's really going on.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.320]  I mean, it's just an incredible work of art.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.400]  Well, thank you very much.
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.800]  And unfortunately, I've read so many mainline history books.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:00.800]  Were pieces of it or not?
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:02.280]  I know your book's accurate.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:03.000]  Right.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.200]  Just incredible.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:06.320]  Let's go ahead and go to another call here.
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.640]  Let's talk to Brad in Pennsylvania.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.480]  You're on the air, Brad.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:11.080]  Hey, Alex.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.520]  Thanks a lot, Jim.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:13.520]  You guys are just awesome.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:15.000]  It's nice to hear you both together.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.400]  Thank you.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.600]  I think you should get him on the show more often, Alex.
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:19.800]  Because I know you have fun with him.
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:21.760]  And I'd love to hear you with your dad on there again,
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.280]  on the show.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.000]  Because that was a great interplay.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.160]  Your dad's an awesome guy.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.360]  Well, he looks just like him.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.280]  I think it'd be his body double.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:28.880]  Maybe he would.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.440]  Actually, Jim is my dad.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.760]  Let's start a new conspiracy theory.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.520]  Me and his dad are going to hire out his bookends.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:37.320]  I'm sorry, Brad.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:37.320]  Great.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.640]  Good luck tonight with the show.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.920]  And I'm a prison planet TV member.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:44.080]  I'd love to see that stuff live if you guys could do it.
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.480]  But I'm sure you'll probably replay it.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:48.200]  But best of luck to you tonight.
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.640]  Well, it's a technical issue.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:51.240]  If I could hire more crew, we could do it.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:53.880]  I got Skeleton crew, though I'm trying to hire people.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.160]  Whereas folks, they're working seven days a week.
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:58.160]  And I was about to do it, but our IT guys
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:00.520]  would have to stay up there until like 11 tonight.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.680]  And actually, they let me do it.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.760]  But I can only deal out so much of use here.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.880]  But thank you so much.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:07.280]  We will get it up there for prisonplanet.tv viewers
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.320]  the next few days.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.240]  It'll be up there for everybody.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:11.520]  Let's go to Chad and Georgia.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.320]  Chad, you're on the air.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:15.960]  Yeah, I got a question about vaccines.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:20.560]  I've got some friends who were trying to get their kid
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:21.240]  into school.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:25.440]  And they basically said, unless their kid had vaccines,
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.000]  that they wouldn't admit him into school.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.320]  Yeah, that's all a fraud, color of law fraud.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:35.160]  There's no law you've got to have vaccines to go to school.
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:37.000]  Then they lie and say, well, if you're not vaccinated,
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.360]  you'll get the other kids sick.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:39.560]  Well, they took all the shots.
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:42.080]  They're not protected from the shots.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:44.400]  But the vaccine companies pay the federal government
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:47.640]  to then pay the schools a certain percentage.
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.560]  In some cases, it's over $1,000.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.480]  This is all on record to vaccinate.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:54.800]  So they lie to you and say it's the law.
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.040]  There's a waiver.
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.680]  But still, that's a waiver to policy, not to law.
[01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:01.160]  And now they're starting to lie and say it is the law, Jim.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:02.840]  Yeah, no, there's no law.
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:04.920]  But I would simply say to your friends,
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:07.520]  if you truly care about your children's health,
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.600]  and particularly if you care about their education,
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.160]  you might consider homeschooling.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.280]  Well, I know that my children have not been vaccinated,
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.480]  and they're sick about 1-third as much as regular kids
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:17.240]  once a year.
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.320]  Some other kids are like sick every other month.
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:20.040]  That's right.
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.000]  I never had a lot of vaccines, and I'm healthy.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.600]  Everybody, look, they admit when you take the flu shot,
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.200]  it doubles your chances of getting the flu shot the next year.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.560]  Canadian government admits that.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.880]  That's right, because anybody who knows about vaccinations
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.680]  knows that what they're doing is giving you
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:36.240]  a little bit of what they're trying to prevent.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:40.400]  And so, you know, and there's something a fairly high,
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:43.720]  like 20% like, say, they vaccinate you against chicken pox.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:44.280]  You end up getting it.
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:45.680]  20% get the chicken pox.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:48.160]  No, no, they admit the UN program giving people
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.040]  the polio vaccine is what's actually causing polio world
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:51.320]  to go now.
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:51.840]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:53.480]  Well, that gets into a whole different thing,
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:56.320]  but that's because the polio vaccine was adulterated
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:59.680]  with the coronavirus immunization virus.
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.000]  40, yeah.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:01.640]  Thank you, sir.
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:02.360]  Good points.
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:03.200]  Appreciate the call.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.480]  It's total fraud.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.280]  And again, even if you think vaccines are good,
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:09.400]  they lie and say it's the law.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.800]  I mean, come on, they're lying to you.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:11.440]  Stop the movie.
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.040]  They really are.
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.040]  There's no law.
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.400]  It's just like, here we are almost at tax time,
[01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:21.200]  and there is no law that says you have to pay your tax.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.840]  Speaking of Ron Paul, they always say,
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:24.680]  how are we going to build a government
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:25.680]  without the income tax?
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.600]  And a lot of times, he's standing in front of the Capitol,
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.640]  and he goes, well, we built this capital right here
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.000]  behind me without it.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.200]  We didn't even have an income tax until 1913.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.320]  And as you know, it was only 1% up until about 1950.
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.680]  It was a temporary war tax during World War II.
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.360]  Let's go to Howard in Connecticut.
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.560]  Howard, you're on the air with Jim Mars.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.120]  Hi, Jim.
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.400]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.920]  Again, this is Jim.
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:48.920]  Hi, sir.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.040]  Again, your work is great.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.280]  I've read many of your books.
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:54.480]  And Alex, your work is just incomprehensible.
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.960]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.400]  Thank you for so much you're doing.
[01:53:57.400 --> 01:53:58.880]  We're hoping that you come up north here.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:01.160]  We're in Connecticut here with We Are Change Connecticut,
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:04.240]  hoping that you're going to be in the northeast in the future.
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:06.160]  I do intend to do a northeast thing.
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:09.360]  I mean, I've got like over 100 stations I need to visit.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:12.200]  But I do intend to try to get up there.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.440]  That's fantastic.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.920]  Definitely interested in the blueprint
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.280]  to defeat the new world order.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:18.480]  And anything we can do here, We Are Change Connecticut,
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:21.160]  we've got your back, sir.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.000]  And just wanted to talk about the eugenics.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.840]  You mentioned all this stuff.
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:27.120]  There's a company called Reed Elzevir.
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:30.120]  Are you guys familiar with that company?
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.760]  Reed Elzevir?
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:33.120]  Reed Elzevir, right.
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:36.920]  It is a conglomerate that owns, because we're
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.880]  talking about the homeschooling and the vaccines.
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:41.120]  Well, guess what this company owns?
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.600]  This company owns, among other things, Lexisnexus,
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.600]  the data mining for basically everything, CIA, FBI.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.240]  Yeah, I know what that is, yeah.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.880]  OK, they also own variety magazines,
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:58.680]  15,000 propaganda magazines.
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:01.280]  They own Cell and Lancet magazine.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.560]  They publish the medical books that are in the medical.
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:07.240]  So it's a giant, giant holding company, like Bain,
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:08.720]  owned in Clark Channel in the past.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:10.080]  What are they up to?
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.680]  Well, they're putting in the books, like hardcore books.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:15.520]  My son goes to Catholic school, and his books
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:17.480]  have Illuminati Symbolisms in it.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:20.120]  They have mathematical equations, Alex,
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:23.280]  that they use disinformation in the equation.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.160]  Like, for example, this is not in the book,
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.960]  but it would be two planes leave Boston, traveling
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:31.720]  at the rate of x amount of miles per hour.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:34.720]  How long will it take them to crash into the buildings
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:36.880]  after they were hijacked by terrorists?
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:39.480]  So they're actually using this.
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:40.880]  It's politically laced.
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.600]  My son was playing some game called Brain Pop, a history
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.000]  game, and it was all, do we have total communism
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.120]  or partial communism?
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:51.480]  Because you play the part of the president in this game,
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:53.680]  and it's like, well, the total communism's not good,
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:54.840]  but the partial communism.
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.640]  It's like, do we have total taxes?
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:58.720]  Or only increase them on the rich?
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:00.840]  And then it's like, and my son said, neither.
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.040]  And they go, well, that's bad policy.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:03.520]  We need to raise it.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.760]  So yeah, I mean, the brainwashing is just off the charts.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:07.760]  Thank you so much, Howard.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:08.400]  It's incredible.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:11.520]  It's like, how many shots did Lee Harvey Oswald fire?
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:13.520]  You know, three, four?
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.440]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.240]  Maybe he didn't fire any adults.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.680]  They give you false choices.
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:19.920]  Real fast, Brandon in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.680]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.640]  I got just a couple of points, really.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.640]  I can definitely speak on behalf of the military,
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:30.080]  trying to train people for a gift constitution,
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.680]  and also being basically lab rats,
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:35.440]  because I just got done doing five years' active duty.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.200]  Then they tried to say militia groups are illegal,
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:42.080]  that you have no rights being in the military,
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:44.320]  and getting anthrax shot.
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:47.120]  You ask them, hey, will this prevent anthrax?
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:47.960]  They say, nope.
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:50.240]  If you had anthrax, you would die.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.880]  Brandon, what's the point of the shots?
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:53.720]  No, no, they admitted that wouldn't,
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.880]  but by the way, that's illegal.
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:56.480]  We stopped them 10 years ago giving it,
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.040]  because it's, quote, experimental.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:00.080]  So they just brought it back exactly.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.040]  It's incredible.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:05.360]  They get paid by big companies to use you as lab rats.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:09.640]  I actually just got diagnosed with, called McZoma.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:11.600]  It's a tumor in the jaw bone.
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:15.600]  Only, I think, at max, 6% of the country gets.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:18.240]  All these rare cancers are exploding in the troops.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:19.840]  They're killing you, sir.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:20.840]  They're eugenicists.
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:21.560]  They hate you.
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:22.840]  I mean, I can't believe this.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:25.880]  So they made you take experimental shots?
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.960]  Oh, and the VA keeps telling me to ask me to get flu shots.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:32.000]  I keep, I'm not going to get flu shots, because, oh, I can't.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.200]  Folks, they're Nazis.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.200]  They're the eugenicists who created the Nazis.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:36.800]  God bless you.
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.480]  Just warn other troops, warn others.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.480]  We can't get to Merrill.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.080]  We're out of time.
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:41.080]  Jim, we're going to speak tonight.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:43.240]  We'll put the video on the web, jimmars.com,
[01:57:43.240 --> 01:57:44.440]  infowars.com.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:45.240]  Thank you for watching.
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:46.240]  God bless you.
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:46.740]  God bless you.
[01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:48.440]  Great job of the crew in Austin.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.640]  Great job of the crew here, and all the folks coming out
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.640]  here.
