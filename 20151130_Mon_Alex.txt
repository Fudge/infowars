[00:42.040 --> 00:46.800]  what my experience with criminal gangs taught me about Obama Hillary and the
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.720]  Democratic Party this is the former Reagan speechwriter and advisor who has
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.360]  multiple first in his class degrees and no criminal record who served nine months

[01:11.520 --> 01:16.920]  criminal gangs because that's exactly what we're dealing with and what we're
[01:16.920 --> 01:22.240]  facing and if you use any other terminology you're lying our rhetoric
[01:22.240 --> 01:29.640]  must reach the level of their evil or they win it's a wall of fraud a wall of
[01:29.640 --> 01:35.000]  lies with all these global politicians the biggest gathering of world leaders
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.960]  in history is what Politico and the New York Times are dubbing it in Paris

[02:35.640 --> 02:39.640]  notice all hell's breaking loose militarily economically socially the
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.320]  globalist are moving to collapse the West crash the United States poses
[02:44.320 --> 02:51.600]  saviors and bring incomplete tyranny on its back that is their specialty it's
[02:51.600 --> 02:55.760]  what they do it's what they've always done look at how they bring in the
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.800]  radical jihadis let them attack and then ban free speech all over Europe
[02:59.800 --> 03:03.480]  arresting people that protest against global government arresting
[03:03.480 --> 03:09.120]  nationalists arresting anybody and then they stand around in Obama here's a
[03:09.120 --> 03:15.120]  quote I have one of his quotes quote climate summit a rejection of terror
[03:15.120 --> 03:22.000]  nothing will stand in our way nothing will deter us as the quote we shall go
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.600]  on to the end we shall defend our island whatever the case may be we shall
[03:26.600 --> 03:29.840]  fight in the streets and in the fields and in the hills and on the landing

[03:34.080 --> 03:38.800]  shall defend our island and we shall never surrender the difference is at
[03:38.800 --> 03:47.800]  least England was actually facing the German blitz the lightning bombs you
[03:47.800 --> 03:50.880]  look at these world leaders on the stage they are the authors they are the
[03:50.880 --> 03:55.760]  frontmen and women screwing us over and they sit there and go we will not be the
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.400]  Ted Prince Charles stood forward we must save the earth global taxes now
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.880]  global taxes forever here here and of course who owns part of the climate
[04:06.880 --> 04:11.840]  exchange you cannot make this up Prince Charles the Queen of England Lord Roth
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.240]  child Al Gore Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and George
[04:17.240 --> 04:23.520]  Soros actually I have mainstream articles today admitting that Han showing the
[04:23.520 --> 04:30.120]  whole event is Soros in Paris Russia just outlawed his organization as a
[04:30.120 --> 04:35.360]  foreign group like Specter in fact you only the head of Specter is it's not
[04:35.360 --> 04:42.240]  some guy in a James Bond movie in fact Colonel Craig Roberts we need to get
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.680]  him on again soon he had family in the CIA pretty high level and they told him
[04:47.680 --> 04:50.400]  back in the 60s they said well we don't know the name of the organization but
[04:50.400 --> 04:54.640]  we call it the octopus you see that's that's that's fiction imitating
[04:54.640 --> 04:58.040]  reality folks we actually face specter
[04:58.040 --> 05:01.880]  turkeys reportedly blocking Russian ships from sailing through the Strait of
[05:01.880 --> 05:05.760]  Bosporus near Istanbul which links the Black Sea to Mediterranean right now
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.240]  only Turkish naval vessels are moving through the Bosporus whereas Russian
[05:09.240 --> 05:13.080]  ships are just sitting nearby waiting to pass this is a huge deal that could
[05:13.080 --> 05:16.320]  easily lead to a war because Russia is going to feel threatened if it's boxed
[05:16.320 --> 05:19.960]  in for one thing this prevents Russia's Black Sea fleet from traveling to the
[05:19.960 --> 05:23.360]  rest of the world or even back to its home port meanwhile Russian president
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.440]  Vladimir Putin ordered 150,000 Russian troops deployed in the Syria while also
[05:27.440 --> 05:31.920]  sending another 7,000 Russian troops with tanks rocket launchers and artillery to
[05:31.920 --> 05:35.560]  the Russian Turkish border with orders to be fully combat ready here's the scary
[05:35.560 --> 05:38.640]  part even though Turkey initiated standoff with Russia by intentionally
[05:38.640 --> 05:42.040]  shooting down a Russian jet near the Syrian border it can evoke article 5
[05:42.040 --> 05:46.080]  in the NATO treaty which requires all NATO members including the US to come to
[05:46.080 --> 05:49.200]  its defense if Turkey goes to war with Russia if there's going to be another

[09:02.680 --> 09:08.080]  assembled in Paris France clearly they allow the jihadis in en masse clearly
[09:08.080 --> 09:11.760]  they knew the attacks were coming and allowed them to take place so they can
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.760]  then declare martial law which they've done civil emergency and at least eight
[09:15.760 --> 09:20.400]  of the 20 plus member states of Europe Germany and France are quote under

[09:45.760 --> 09:49.120]  UN has announced a global directive and is now taking control of local police
[09:49.120 --> 09:53.400]  departments in the United States and Europe and are directing former Stasi
[09:53.400 --> 09:58.680]  agents in Germany to carry out the arrest by directing the police to arrest
[09:58.680 --> 10:01.880]  people that criticize the open borders by the way I have news articles about
[10:01.880 --> 10:08.680]  that today this is totalitarianism it is hardcore and it's just getting started
[10:08.680 --> 10:13.800]  and coming up political prisoner Dinesh de Souza stealing America what my
[10:13.800 --> 10:17.840]  experience with criminal gangs taught me about Obama Hillary and the Democratic
[10:17.840 --> 10:24.920]  Party political prisoner Dinesh de Souza will be joining us coming up ladies and
[10:24.920 --> 10:31.080]  gentlemen we'll also have Lord Moncton, Mark Moreno and others reporting from

[10:37.200 --> 10:41.160]  is total world government the text is still secret but we've gotten large
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.720]  pieces of it in the past it just integrates TPP, NAU and the EU into a
[10:45.720 --> 10:50.320]  global super state global taxes backed by a basket of currencies with an
[10:50.320 --> 10:56.280]  overall carbon strategic drawing right currency digital controlled by six major
[10:56.280 --> 11:02.320]  global banks you will then be taxed digitally on all human activity and it
[11:02.320 --> 11:07.520]  will be paid to a handful of individuals chief amongst them the Rothschild family
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.240]  the Rockefeller family and of course you guessed it the British Royal family and
[11:12.240 --> 11:18.640]  of course people like George Soros you cannot make this up I have it in the news
[11:18.640 --> 11:24.880]  today how George Soros runs it all you've got carbon trading in Chicago
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.560]  carbon trading in New York carbon trading in London carbon trading in
[11:29.560 --> 11:34.880]  Frankfurt carbon trading in Tokyo carbon trading in Durban South Africa you've
[11:34.880 --> 11:40.840]  got more than 20 carbon trading centers and they're all literally owned by the
[11:40.840 --> 11:45.880]  Rothschilds the Rockefellers and every other piece of trash you can imagine
[11:45.880 --> 11:50.920]  like Ted Turner Bill Gates I mean it is a gravy train of open taxes paid
[11:50.920 --> 11:58.360]  directly to criminal maggots you cannot make it up a Nazi collaborator who
[11:58.360 --> 12:03.520]  helped round up thousands and rob them who told 60 minutes he's not sorry for
[12:03.520 --> 12:11.160]  it running anti-liberty organizations in America George Soros good God what will
[12:11.160 --> 12:18.600]  we not put up with this is a sick nightmare but America is in a coma of
[12:18.600 --> 12:25.400]  entertainment and sports and drugs and alcohol America is in a coma and has
[12:25.400 --> 12:33.560]  learned to put up with so much we have mass total Stockholm syndrome where you
[12:33.560 --> 12:37.400]  defend your abuser so before I get to all this news I'm gonna break down mass
[12:37.400 --> 12:40.420]  Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness the normalcy bias the
[12:40.420 --> 12:47.080]  Overton window one more time my personal trainer came over today and trained me
[12:47.080 --> 12:53.440]  and we went out jogged up some hills and he said he'll come on air he's gonna
[12:53.440 --> 12:57.200]  dig up the stuff off the local Facebook he lives over in a gentrified you know
[12:57.200 --> 13:03.240]  area of East Austin and he was describing how it's on the Facebook for the
[13:03.240 --> 13:09.880]  neighborhood that there's a 17 year old young black man who has been arrested
[13:09.880 --> 13:14.680]  more than he said 12 times because they even got a copy of his police report
[13:14.680 --> 13:20.640]  even though he's a minor he does home invasions and has been arrested a bunch
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.120]  for attacking his family attacking other people according to what Pat Riley was
[13:25.120 --> 13:30.200]  telling me and on and they've all agreed collectively on the Facebook of over a
[13:30.200 --> 13:34.040]  hundred homes not to call the police on him because they quote don't want to
[13:34.040 --> 13:39.640]  ruin his future but it gets worse it's not even because he's black let me
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.400]  explain this there's a white woman they've got a description all chatted
[13:44.400 --> 13:48.920]  up the car she drives everything who follows the UPS truck and everybody I
[13:48.920 --> 13:53.680]  know I've had a UPS package stolen the last month Anthony's had three packages
[13:53.680 --> 14:00.480]  stolen and the good shiardi from his front door it was house
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.980]  including samples from a factory a new product stuff like that it's so bad it
[14:05.980 --> 14:10.320]  got stolen again when it came and it's just an epidemic that's another area of
[14:10.320 --> 14:14.720]  Austin this woman they've got her plates they've got everything and they all
[14:14.720 --> 14:17.260]  debate whether they should call the cops and they said well we don't want to
[14:17.260 --> 14:22.160]  ruin her life maybe she you know needs to steal the packages see it's not
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.400]  because she's a woman a white woman it's not because it's a black man they are
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.560]  such cowards that they cannot defend themselves they've been taught to lay
[14:32.560 --> 14:41.320]  down they have Stockholm syndrome they they have such a rested development that
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.000]  he's allowed to break in houses assault people all of it and the police are
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.240]  blowing up at the neighborhood saying you see him committing crimes you see
[14:50.240 --> 14:54.200]  this lady stuff you better tell us or it's aiding and abetting that's I mean
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.720]  these people in fact they're trying to a sponge it right now but I'm we're
[14:58.720 --> 15:06.600]  downloading the Facebook I'm just gonna show this as a microcosm of how sick
[15:06.600 --> 15:12.360]  this is I have stacks of news of people being raped in Europe and they tell the
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.360]  police I don't want them charged even when women are drug into the alleys and
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.920]  raped in front of people and they call the cops the woman says don't do
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.840]  anything you know it's a Muslim and and I feel sorry for the migrant this is
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.760]  Stockholm syndrome which went on throughout history but it was given a
[15:29.760 --> 15:33.840]  clinical name obviously back in the 60s for Stockholm Sweden in a case where
[15:33.840 --> 15:37.400]  people were held hostage and within a few weeks began absolutely serving and
[15:37.400 --> 15:46.240]  worshipping their abusers and this is what it is this is the freakishness but
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.720]  then the very same liberals if you are a man or a business owner or a libertarian
[15:50.720 --> 15:54.520]  or a Christian or a veteran they've been taught you need to be attacked you need
[15:54.520 --> 16:00.920]  to be put in your place you need to be gone after and impact and driven and no
[16:00.920 --> 16:06.400]  amount of work you do no amount of risk you put yourself at and it's almost like
[16:06.400 --> 16:11.080]  it's cute and funny you know for women to make jokes like oh while your wife
[16:11.080 --> 16:15.360]  cleaned up after Thanksgiving I bet you went and took a nap and watched
[16:15.360 --> 16:22.800]  football no I came into the office and worked all three days getting other
[16:22.800 --> 16:28.520]  work done when I could be off air that I had piled up but see it's just this
[16:28.520 --> 16:35.440]  default little let's pack it man let's act like they didn't do anything this is
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.560]  warfare against humanity this is absolute garbage and there's one world
[16:40.560 --> 16:48.200]  leader the Czech Republic president's out office he was the other one before but
[16:48.200 --> 16:52.280]  there's one world leader now that says it's a military plan globally to shut
[16:52.280 --> 16:55.440]  down sovereign countries and selectively shut down locally owned power
[16:55.440 --> 16:59.240]  stations and to cripple the economy for an energy takeover you got to read
[16:59.240 --> 17:04.000]  Putin's full speech from a month ago it's like four pages long
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.240]  describing how it's a fraud how it's a scam how it's going to strangle Russia
[17:08.240 --> 17:11.600]  and everyone else and how humanity has to come together and build a
[17:11.600 --> 17:15.320]  civilization for people now this is an anti-human economy being built that's
[17:15.320 --> 17:20.040]  about austerity and poverty to control people he's describing communism he's
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.440]  describing the New World Order he's describing the hell that we're going
[17:24.440 --> 17:28.600]  under and I'm sorry he told the truth so I'm gonna repeat it but where'd you hear
[17:28.600 --> 17:34.880]  it thousands of times here because that's what it is and we must recognize
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.160]  it for what it is and rebuke it and stand up to it on every front this is a
[17:39.160 --> 17:44.000]  legendary crossroads we've come to this is the decision point for the world
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.840]  history right now they selectively can tell any country they want under these
[17:50.840 --> 17:54.440]  treaties how much carbon they can put out China has been told you can have
[17:54.440 --> 18:02.480]  unlimited India has been told you've got to make major cuts China is launching
[18:02.480 --> 18:07.880]  the climate satellites that are going to be partly owned and controlled by the
[18:07.880 --> 18:15.680]  Soros group and others that are going to tax everyone you cannot make this up the
[18:15.680 --> 18:21.400]  full military hatred of this global combine that controls our governments
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.880]  and siphons our energy and places off against each other and openly funds
[18:24.880 --> 18:31.560]  terrorists and openly runs white slavery rings and is involved in every evil you
[18:31.560 --> 18:38.400]  can imagine you'll hear about some jail guard in Romania or something in World
[18:38.400 --> 18:43.440]  War two that helped load some you know prisoners on trucks that later got
[18:43.440 --> 18:48.280]  killed and they'll arrest some 96 year old man who's totally senile and doesn't
[18:48.280 --> 18:51.640]  even know who he is and then half the time it turns out they weren't even a
[18:51.640 --> 18:59.760]  guard but then Soros prances around saying I'm not ashamed I did what I had
[18:59.760 --> 19:07.280]  to do rounding everybody up to survive and I've talked to so many leftists here
[19:07.280 --> 19:10.120]  on air they'll go well he did what he had to do to live and I go see that's
[19:10.120 --> 19:15.240]  that's what you are your cowards I mean somebody tells me to sell people out

[26:07.120 --> 26:12.160]  years ago out of Breitbart that shows our success and other success turning the
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.000]  libertarian conservative movement into radicals as the White House run George
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.880]  Soros funded media matters bemoans we didn't get Breitbart and Rush Limbaugh
[26:20.880 --> 26:25.000]  and Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity to pick up our talking points what we're
[26:25.000 --> 26:31.080]  saying is true you're a criminal gang who wants to make money on all human
[26:31.080 --> 26:34.720]  activities you point cameras I've got a stack of news today where they point
[26:34.720 --> 26:42.040]  cameras in the winter at power plants and they show what looks like smoke
[26:42.040 --> 26:47.160]  shooting out of them but it's water vapor that's why the smoke ends a couple of
[26:47.160 --> 26:53.440]  hundred feet above it because it's not smoke it's like the smoke when you're
[26:53.440 --> 26:56.160]  two years old you think blows out of your mouth when you go outside in the
[26:56.160 --> 27:02.800]  cold snowy wind it's not smoke it's water condensation now I know our
[27:02.800 --> 27:06.800]  listeners know that but I look at these parlor tricks they never stop they're
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.640]  back on the news shang polar bears can't swim and penguins are dying they
[27:10.640 --> 27:15.120]  can't swim the ice sheets have both gotten bigger the planet's going into a
[27:15.120 --> 27:19.240]  cold stage because the Sun's going partially dormant it's a known cycle it
[27:19.240 --> 27:26.400]  was predicted by all the astrophysicist 50 years ago doesn't matter because the
[27:26.400 --> 27:32.320]  UN five years ago had a vote and said no the Sun doesn't affect climate one bit
[27:32.320 --> 27:41.560]  that's like saying oxygen doesn't affect humans one bit we die without
[27:41.560 --> 27:48.320]  sunlight we die we'd be absolute zero in a matter of days the Sun is the complete
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.520]  driver everything else isn't even a few percentage points in the different
[27:53.520 --> 28:00.560]  metric breakdowns not thermal energy not different radiation from deep space
[28:00.560 --> 28:08.080]  none of it it doesn't even show up compared to that giant thermonuclear
[28:08.080 --> 28:17.040]  fireball these people feed us pure lies like we're idiots and the message
[28:17.040 --> 28:24.440]  becomes the medium becomes the people you have been fed mindless tripe to the
[28:24.440 --> 28:30.720]  point that most people can't even understand what I'm saying right now I'm
[28:30.720 --> 28:39.200]  talking about mainline idiots it is ridiculous it is over the top it is
[28:39.200 --> 28:46.120]  sickening oh but don't worry let's play this clip Obama opened up the summit by
[28:46.120 --> 28:50.080]  saying nothing will deter us we know nothing will deter you funding al-qaeda
[28:50.080 --> 28:53.360]  nothing will deter you with forced inoculations nothing will deter you
[28:53.360 --> 28:57.520]  trying to blow up our economy with Obamacare Obamacare is the equivalent of
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.440]  an enemy blowing up your power plants how about a wet blanket on the economy
[29:02.440 --> 29:06.440]  Obama is dumping sugar in the gas tank you what are you doing I'm trying to
[29:06.440 --> 29:10.840]  help you're like this is sugar no it's not your car's gonna run real great try

[29:16.560 --> 29:21.200]  with Obama here he is on the nothing will deter them here it is and we salute
[29:21.200 --> 29:28.200]  the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on when they ran
[29:28.200 --> 29:33.680]  the terror attacks bringing them in an act of defiance that proves nothing will
[29:33.680 --> 29:38.200]  deter us from building the future we want for our children the hellhole where
[29:38.200 --> 29:43.040]  you can't have cars or power which you went out or rejection and you and you
[29:43.040 --> 29:53.160]  lost our right we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[30:02.440 --> 30:05.640]  the public into accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly
[30:05.640 --> 30:09.000]  stop global warming global warming is a manufactured problem played up by the
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.480]  government to instigate a public reaction in this case fear the government
[30:12.480 --> 30:16.360]  then exploits to operate a predetermined solution the strategy now known as the
[30:16.360 --> 30:19.560]  Hegelian dialectic has been used successfully by politicians for
[30:19.560 --> 30:22.800]  millennia to expand government which can only grow at the expense of individual
[30:22.800 --> 30:26.800]  liberties the Bush administration uses strategy successfully in 2003 when it
[30:26.800 --> 30:30.400]  gained enough public support for the invasion of Iraq a claiming country had
[30:30.400 --> 30:33.760]  weapons of mass destruction and the war ultimately expanded the military
[30:33.760 --> 30:37.400]  industrial complex in America's merging police state today global warming is
[30:37.400 --> 30:41.040]  used as a buggy man because allows the UN to use government-funded scientists to
[30:41.040 --> 30:44.360]  scare the public into believing that man-made climate change is too big of a
[30:44.360 --> 30:47.400]  threat for their country to handle alone and thus it's can only be defeated
[30:47.400 --> 30:50.680]  through the expansion of the UN at the expense of their nation's sovereignty the

[34:33.440 --> 34:38.000]  vote 99% socialist to come into these countries and feed on what's left of
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.640]  christened them because we hate your guts but it's okay because my dad was
[34:45.640 --> 34:51.320]  black and Merkel's a woman and Hillary's a woman so let's just have a
[34:51.320 --> 34:57.160]  discussion about that I want to get into all this news play a bunch of clips go
[34:57.160 --> 34:59.720]  through the huge Russia developments I spent a lot of time on that year's
[34:59.720 --> 35:03.640]  days haven't gotten to that yet but frankly I don't know what's more
[35:03.640 --> 35:07.520]  important because it all goes together the global government biggest meeting of
[35:07.520 --> 35:14.760]  world leaders ever trade experts trans Pacific partnership vehicle to pass
[35:14.760 --> 35:17.840]  Obama climate change treaty well yeah that's what we've written about what
[35:17.840 --> 35:25.560]  we've said now the text is public it's the agreement to this agreement so now
[35:25.560 --> 35:31.240]  is just the PR rollout with videos of polar bears falling in the water and
[35:31.240 --> 35:36.600]  they can't swim and penguins dying literally lying to everyone and just a
[35:36.600 --> 35:40.920]  bunch of PR with them announcing everyone agrees save the earth carbon
[35:40.920 --> 35:50.680]  oxides killing us track it all tax the carbon cycle it is the total takeover
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.120]  and then the earth cools because of the Sun cycle they go okay now it's not
[35:54.120 --> 36:00.240]  heating it's a change change it's always gonna be changing and when it gets
[36:00.240 --> 36:03.240]  cold they say it's climate change when it gets hot they say it's climate change
[36:03.240 --> 36:08.120]  when it rains is climate change when there's a dust storm it's climate change
[36:08.520 --> 36:12.640]  you want to know the real climate change that humans have done in the last
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.560]  thousand plus years or more that has screwed up a lot of the planet and
[36:16.560 --> 36:21.400]  really caused major problems and lowered carbon dioxide levels in the last few
[36:21.400 --> 36:25.160]  thousand years one of the lowest levels ever recorded going back millions they've
[36:25.160 --> 36:29.220]  got the ice cores they've got the mud cores that we they've got them it did
[36:29.220 --> 36:32.160]  bump up a little bit the 20th century because of human activity probably I
[36:32.160 --> 36:35.680]  mean less than 1% look it up
[36:36.080 --> 36:43.800]  but if you expand on that the Sahara Desert a couple thousand years ago in
[36:43.800 --> 36:48.560]  the central areas of any other areas was actually rivers and forest and jungles
[36:48.560 --> 36:56.120]  and nomadic humans came in with cows and with goats and with sheep now cows run
[36:56.120 --> 37:01.800]  ruts in the dirt and cause runoff and problems but goats eat down and will pull
[37:01.800 --> 37:08.680]  the root up and eat it too cows don't eat the root and the Texas hill country in
[37:08.680 --> 37:13.640]  the 1830s when mainly Scottish Irish and German but also Czech and Polish
[37:13.640 --> 37:20.320]  immigrants came in they were the majority they brought goats and sheep with
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.760]  them and there was six foot tall grass in Austin Texas and in the hill country
[37:24.760 --> 37:31.080]  there was about six inches seven inches of pure black soil and giant oak trees we
[37:31.080 --> 37:37.000]  look like New Zealand is what the paintings are like I mean a heavenly
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.480]  place the water stayed in the ground it was bound to the ground there were
[37:40.480 --> 37:46.320]  streams and creeks and an aquifer it's most of Texas right under the ground the
[37:46.320 --> 37:53.760]  Edwards aquifer and so there were just screams everywhere clear hill springs
[37:53.760 --> 37:57.000]  just pouring right out of the side just everywhere Germans got here and they
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.320]  just think we're wrote they wrote about they just flipped out and said we have
[38:00.320 --> 38:08.920]  found Valhalla and they planted Syrian junipers which is an invasive species
[38:08.920 --> 38:12.440]  that sucks up all the water because they liked them in Europe they grow you know
[38:12.440 --> 38:17.520]  300 you know 200 feet tall whatever they're huge they grow like 10 feet tall
[38:17.520 --> 38:28.960]  here 20 feet tall and goats within 50 years ate everything down the soil ran
[38:28.960 --> 38:34.120]  off and it looks like the surface of the moon outside Austin Texas for hundreds
[38:34.120 --> 38:41.880]  of miles to the north and to the west and they just chewed everything down to
[38:41.880 --> 38:47.640]  the ground down to the limestone down to the coral and this was an ocean and
[38:47.640 --> 38:53.720]  there's just big coral heads everywhere and in fossils and you're on the bottom
[38:53.720 --> 39:01.120]  of the ocean they annihilated it so let's get really environmental you want to
[39:01.120 --> 39:06.520]  talk about what turns stuff into desert into wastelands it's called goats it's
[39:06.520 --> 39:13.400]  called goats and Germans and Poles and Czechs like to eat goat and the things
[39:13.400 --> 39:17.960]  bred like cockroaches there's wild ones just all over the place running around
[39:17.960 --> 39:22.000]  like roaches they need to be exterminated eating everything another
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.960]  thing it's goats but good god people they'll eat shoes they eat anything
[39:29.800 --> 39:35.120]  carbon dioxide the reason carbon dioxide's gone down is because so many
[39:35.120 --> 39:38.880]  plants have died on the surface of the earth and then they're not putting it
[39:38.880 --> 39:43.560]  back out they put carbon dioxide and oxygen out do you realize how obscene
[39:43.560 --> 39:54.880]  it is to claim that carbon dioxide's bad it has been hundreds of times what it
[39:54.880 --> 39:59.760]  is now and do you know what happens oxygen levels didn't go up in every
[39:59.760 --> 40:04.760]  study mammals live a lot longer in higher oxygen environments in fact they've
[40:04.760 --> 40:08.920]  done some university studies you can look them up where rats have lived 30 to
[40:08.920 --> 40:15.320]  40 percent longer in a higher oxygen environment oxygen is a tiny trace gas
[40:15.320 --> 40:22.760]  there's traces of it in the atmosphere traces traces and the cycle that creates
[40:22.760 --> 40:29.160]  carbon dioxide creates oxygen the earth is literally dying fact many scientists
[40:29.160 --> 40:37.400]  believe we're losing our atmosphere like Mars did but as planets lose atmosphere
[40:37.400 --> 40:42.280]  they have organic life on them they can regenerate their atmosphere we're
[40:42.280 --> 40:47.560]  losing our terraforming capability and the best analysis I've got of the geo
[40:47.560 --> 40:52.800]  engineering is everything they're doing is trying to kill the atmosphere of the
[40:52.800 --> 40:57.120]  planet I'm telling you folks it's like space aliens run the new world order and
[40:57.120 --> 41:00.360]  they want to kill the planet and this is just some cycle thing they do like the
[41:00.360 --> 41:04.600]  guy that wrote the Tarzan books he wrote John Carter kind of a cheesy movie but
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.400]  you read the book where there's these aliens that slowly came to Mars and then
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.480]  slowly had them basically destroy their atmosphere because they just want to kill
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.120]  other civilizations before they rise up and they look like humans but they're
[41:16.120 --> 41:19.560]  behind the scenes running things I'm not saying that's what I think is going on
[41:19.560 --> 41:27.560]  but it's the only way it makes sense for what the elite do but see because of
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.840]  universal free will in the universe we have to be induced to make the decision
[41:31.840 --> 41:35.640]  and agree to them to kill the planet and then you can say well they're demon
[41:35.640 --> 41:38.760]  possessed it's creatures from another dimension you know take the biblical
[41:38.760 --> 41:44.400]  perspective I don't know all I know is these people want to kill us and the
[41:44.400 --> 41:49.080]  planet do you understand that I've got stacks of news where they are putting
[41:49.080 --> 41:53.000]  Frank and fish in the ocean that are two to three times bigger than regular
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.120]  salmon and they're not even going to let you know on the label it's GMO when it
[41:57.120 --> 42:04.200]  has insect genes in it zoologically folks crossing species is so dangerous
[42:04.200 --> 42:08.960]  especially from different families hell it's not even a different family it's
[42:08.960 --> 42:18.440]  an incredibly different branch I mean and they've got the nerve to shoot their
[42:18.440 --> 42:26.560]  mouths off about how carbon dioxide is evil and show people images of power
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.840]  plants in the winter with what it'll say pollution smoke and pollution and they
[42:32.840 --> 42:37.080]  show the school kids they go oh they go and then the puppy dies actually have
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.760]  video games and in film reels they show in the US and Australia and other
[42:40.760 --> 42:45.520]  countries where it shows little puppies and pigs having their heads chopped off
[42:45.520 --> 42:49.680]  and blood squirting out we have the articles on info wars.com with the
[42:49.680 --> 42:56.040]  video I think one headline is children Australia told when to die in new eco
[42:56.040 --> 43:00.280]  video game and then and then it says more pigs more dogs more cats more cows
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.040]  will die until you decide to kill yourself and then in the game you win
[43:04.040 --> 43:08.960]  the game by deciding to kill yourself I mean this isn't sick this is an evil
[43:08.960 --> 43:14.040]  run by a fruit bag crazy man the basically the head of real specter
[43:14.040 --> 43:20.960]  George Soros I mean he's one of the field marshals of this you got the rocker
[43:20.960 --> 43:24.400]  fellers on the Rothschilds and all these sick freaks back in the shadows but God
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.960]  almighty heaven help us I don't even have words to describe the over-the-top
[43:29.960 --> 43:42.320]  ridiculous magnitude of these people they want to enslave everyone they want
[43:42.320 --> 43:45.880]  to play God they want to reverse engineer and manipulate the genetics of the
[43:45.880 --> 43:52.440]  entire planet. Monsanto's admitted goal remember like a 99 they were quoted in
[43:52.440 --> 43:57.680]  National Geographic I probably read that on air 30 40 times they said yeah the
[43:57.680 --> 44:01.200]  goal is we're gonna patent everything change it and then have it where you've
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.160]  got to come to us for seeds food trees grass we're gonna own the earth yes of
[44:05.160 --> 44:13.000]  course our goal is monopoly and then of course to then piggyback stack is what
[44:13.000 --> 44:18.080]  they call it traits into the sweet potatoes into the potatoes into the
[44:18.080 --> 44:24.000]  corn into the wheat that literally reduces your fertility and fries your
[44:24.000 --> 44:31.600]  DNA drifts into your cells and they're always finding weird stuff other sub
[44:31.600 --> 44:34.440]  companies they go oh it's just an accident that's in there really well
[44:34.440 --> 44:38.160]  this protein breaks down into a chemical that reduces fertility and of course
[44:38.160 --> 44:41.640]  it's getting and then what was the point of that oh it's just an accident
[44:41.640 --> 44:44.240]  never mind but Roger we're suing you you're not allowed to look what's in there
[44:44.240 --> 44:54.600]  just trust us I'm Bill Gates I love you are nice all my money's tax exempt and I
[44:54.600 --> 44:58.000]  get richer every year because I'm a philanthropist that's what they call me
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.920]  in Time Magazine and you find out he's funding Time Magazine Newsweek ABC News
[45:03.920 --> 45:07.280]  they'll say at the end underwritten by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.800]  they'll be like an hour-long show on on ABC this week I'll be sitting there in a
[45:11.800 --> 45:15.560]  hotel room going I remember once over we were deer hunting and I was sitting there
[45:15.560 --> 45:18.880]  I don't want to stay out at the ranch in an old farm you know in a shack or
[45:18.880 --> 45:21.040]  whatever it's I stayed at a hotel you know I just tired of getting bit by
[45:21.040 --> 45:24.880]  spiders and stuff I am I guess a little hoity-toity but I'm sitting there
[45:24.880 --> 45:28.680]  watching it that's why I didn't watch TVs in hotel rooms a couple years ago my
[45:28.680 --> 45:32.360]  son's sitting next to me we're but I'm hunting them early morning but we're
[45:32.360 --> 45:38.560]  back and I said this is funded by Bill and Melinda Gates because it's all how
[45:38.560 --> 45:41.680]  great they are and how great worm buff it is and we got to have higher taxes
[45:41.680 --> 45:46.360]  to save the earth and all this class warfare envy stuff but I didn't couldn't
[45:46.360 --> 45:51.000]  believe it at the end they just said underwritten and paid for by the
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.000]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation they actually just said it London Guardian is
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.240]  New York Times is so I started doing some research on it because I knew they
[46:00.240 --> 46:05.120]  were involved but I mean it's literally funding basically everything and you're
[46:05.120 --> 46:09.760]  like well that's their money oh really it's their money no their tax exempt and
[46:09.760 --> 46:14.320]  they just take a portion of their profit and then they put it into pushing
[46:14.320 --> 46:23.320]  carbon taxes that they own the company I mean look it up Bill Gates part owner
[46:23.320 --> 46:27.040]  of the carbon exchange Al Gore part owner carbon exchange Queen Elizabeth
[46:27.040 --> 46:30.160]  Prince Charles and then Prince Charles this other and goes this is the
[46:30.160 --> 46:34.960]  greatest meeting in history the greatest assemblage of world leaders to save the
[46:34.960 --> 46:42.320]  earth all three heroes were saving the earth everyone yeah we're saving the
[46:42.320 --> 46:49.280]  earth red carpets helicopter gunships everything else the poor cannot have
[46:49.280 --> 46:56.440]  energy being poor is good my palaces are heated on government welfare money I
[46:56.440 --> 47:02.160]  mean you can't again make up the magnitude over the over the top evil
[47:02.160 --> 47:07.440]  this is on in the third hour of the second hour let me see this is is on a
[47:07.440 --> 47:10.720]  1230 that's perfect so I'll be able to get into the Russia situation huge
[47:10.720 --> 47:16.680]  escalations on that front the Russians ran into a naval blockade which is an
[47:16.680 --> 47:26.280]  active war with the Turkish military blocking their ships all ships have been
[47:26.280 --> 47:36.240]  blocked they're not even in their waters so Russia is now moving a larger fleet
[47:36.240 --> 47:42.080]  in and is saying they're going to block the entire Turkish coastline by Syria and
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.400]  they're calling it operation total destruction you can't make that up
[47:46.400 --> 47:51.120]  either how about operation US Army wear red high heels and prance around that
[47:51.120 --> 47:54.920]  that's what we do operation red high heels people that's crazies and took to
[47:54.920 --> 47:59.360]  moralize our military that's the whole point they're gonna go robot soon this
[47:59.360 --> 48:05.440]  is the end of chevrolet the end of men the end of honor figured it out yet
[48:05.440 --> 48:09.280]  maybe people working with the establishment won't have that sinking
[48:09.280 --> 48:14.840]  feeling if you joined the republic if you joined 1776 worldwide if you decided
[48:14.840 --> 48:22.760]  to suit up and get involved that's all coming up and I'll get more into the
[48:22.760 --> 48:28.640]  situations with the NSA so much more let me just say this you notice we've
[48:28.640 --> 48:32.440]  gotten more aggressive with sales more aggressive with our marketing because
[48:32.440 --> 48:35.160]  that's we want to be competitive we want to have the best products want to have
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.480]  the lowest prices and we have to fund this operation we're extending the Black

[49:30.400 --> 49:35.000]  ends and quite frankly it's been pretty successful but here's my cash 22 we're
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.960]  almost sold out of so much stuff that we're not gonna have a lot of products
[49:37.960 --> 49:41.600]  till next year that's just how it works and with taxes and all of it I can't be
[49:41.600 --> 49:44.680]  hit with a bunch of inventory that's our margins are so low everybody that runs
[49:44.680 --> 49:47.440]  a business knows that our business is fighting the globalist but I have to

[51:05.680 --> 51:09.320]  each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better
[51:09.320 --> 51:13.280]  prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we
[51:13.280 --> 51:17.680]  address the need for water but if you consider heat storage I'm talking about

[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:32.800]  them here it is and we salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:39.120]  conference go on what a hero it's just such a hero an act they close the borders
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.040]  that proves nothing he haughties for him from building the future we want for
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:50.000]  our future hellhole what greater rejection I won't let us have real new
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.120]  energy systems tear down our world we're gonna tear down our world that's what
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.320]  you're doing see tearing down the world crashing the West
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.760]  turkeys reportedly blocking Russian ships from sailing through the Strait of
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.600]  Bosporus near Istanbul which links the Black Sea to Mediterranean right now
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.120]  only Turkish naval vessels are moving through the Bosporus whereas Russian
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.960]  ships are just sitting nearby waiting to pass this is a huge deal that could
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.160]  easily lead to a war because Russia is going to feel threatened if it's boxed
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.840]  in for one thing this prevents Russia's Black Sea fleet from traveling to the
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.280]  rest of the world or even back to its home port meanwhile Russian president
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.320]  Vladimir Putin ordered 150,000 Russian troops deployed into Syria while also
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:31.800]  sending another 7,000 Russian troops with tanks rocket launchers and artillery to
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.160]  the Russian Turkish border with orders to be fully combat ready here's the
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.040]  scary part even though Turkey initiated standoff with Russia by
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.200]  intentionally shooting down a Russian jet near the Syrian border it can invoke
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.960]  article 5 in the NATO treaty which requires all NATO members including the
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.800]  US to come to its defense if Turkey goes to war with Russia if there's going to

[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:45.520]  the presidential polls is Marie Le Pen but of course the answer to that is a
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.720]  rest term because France is so free so how long can sit up there in grandstand
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:54.200]  about how he's protecting you from the radical Islamist by taking your free
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:01.840]  speech. Meanwhile French National Front poised to win regions in major vote
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.600]  poll shows Bloomberg Business but don't worry the socialists have learned how to
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:11.200]  fix elections now it doesn't matter what you do came out three years ago that
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.920]  almost every socialist leader in France is tax-exempt puts their money in Swiss
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:21.440]  bank accounts and the EU bureaucrats are publicly exempt from EU tax why not the
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.400]  public's all cuckled the public's all in a trance and learned helplessness
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.280]  thinking if they just submit more things will get better no a nation of sheep is
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:39.240]  ruled by wolves. Thomas Jefferson you think the more you
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:44.360]  grovel the more you submit the more you lay on your back the freer you are this
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.000]  republic was the freest country the world ever saw it doesn't mean we got very far
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.360]  but further than anyone else and it produced just just just just palaces of
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:58.120]  wealth and innovation and freedom and insight and science and then it produced
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:05.600]  slovenly lazy stupid shelf-hating morons with no instinct no will no strength
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.560]  no fire no passion
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:15.800]  but you could get your soul back anytime you wanted to you just got to claim it
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:21.520]  but it's scary isn't it you might get criticized you might something bad mine
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.520]  it will happen the badness will come because if you go out in the middle of
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.880]  the woods in northern Minnesota and lay around and squeal and wolves are running
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.080]  around out there in the forest and they think you're weak they hear you making
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.160]  those noises they will come and tear your throat out and tear your guts out
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.280]  and they will eat you but if you're stomping around in the woods the matter
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.080]  you don't have a gun or whatever they will see that they will pick that up they
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:51.480]  will run for their lives you know that coyotes had never been recorded in
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.560]  Western history not since the time of Lewis and Clark eating a person that
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.800]  wasn't either almost dead or dead coyotes do not go after humans until now
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:08.160]  they have killed women in the Midwest they have killed multiple Canadians and
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:14.560]  you know why they don't even kill people in the deep woods they kill people at
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.600]  parks on the edge of green belts and it's always women it's always liberals
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:24.080]  they will see some of the dogs they will see some of the wolves they will see
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:31.800]  some of the smaller subspecies basically wolves they will see them and they will
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.240]  start screaming like a horror movie they were taught in Jason Friday 13th that
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.200]  you don't actually run like this from a killer with a machete or fight back you
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.880]  go you fall down and go you know on your on your back on your butt
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.960]  scooting away and women have been taught that so when they see a couple coyotes
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:48.520]  run out in the in the mist I mean I've been on the green belt many times and
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.280]  seen some coyotes two yards away run out in the frosty mist it's always when
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.080]  it's cold they get frisky and they'll actually come out and I don't see a
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.960]  couple coyotes and they see me go boom they're gone but imagine I went and fell
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:06.640]  down that's what women do they actually have been taught this they just fall
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:14.800]  out and go and and then the coyotes come and kill them humans never acted like
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.960]  that
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.840]  but this is the triumph this is feminism that women have been turned into jelly
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.000]  fish women have been turned into it the only tough thing a woman does is boss
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.680]  guys around that's how she gets ahead we'll show those guys the other half
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:38.480]  the species you're being hit by basically alien technology to end the
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.840]  species and you're not even aware of you think it's cute to run around bitching
[01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.520]  about men all day
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.720]  when I say alien technology the GMO the computers all of it is something we've
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:56.960]  never experienced it's all new we're going through major crisis right now and
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.960]  people are so unhappy they're so unfulfilled because they're not being
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.920]  humans you will be so fulfilled if you become a normal human and actually get
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.320]  your mind lined up with God in the universe which you're not going to find
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:11.200]  any stinking rat hole devil worship centers they call churches no top world

[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.880]  enslaved but they always came out on top they never submitted and you think

[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:33.200]  I have told the crew that when I say something that sounds completely outrageous
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.840]  even though reality is completely outrageous to tell me and Matt in there
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.840]  just said hey boss it's pretty funny you said coyotes only eat liberals and women
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:49.840]  well let me be specific liberal women they don't eat men now it's just like
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:54.680]  mountain lions eat mainly children and small women they'll go after some of
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.680]  the things a little bit smaller but the thing is the women don't act aggressive
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:02.080]  they don't stand up they tell you with a bear specifically act like you're dead
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.960]  or don't act like you're scared but that doesn't work as well but with wolves
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:10.120]  coyotes mountain lions that's what you do and if you actually look at these
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:14.720]  cases I've covered them on air they'll just be like a woman in Kansas or a
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.720]  woman in California or a woman in up in Canada forget which switch town and
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.760]  they'll just be at the park having lunch by themselves and then they don't run
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:28.480]  from the coyotes and then they get there and there's a dead woman half eaten by
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.240]  coyotes and I'm telling you that's what's happening is they are falling down
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:40.520]  in fear and groveling and the coyotes are eating them but the whole story is
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:50.360]  about not laying down so if you see a mountain lion and you act afraid and you
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.560]  run they instinctively can't help it most the time they chase you and grab you
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:00.320]  by the back of the neck and try to break your neck that you at Big Bend I was
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.320]  just down there a month ago it's got signs everywhere do not run from the
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.840]  mountain lions throw rocks yell at them and walk backwards keep your eyes on
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.160]  them in India they have a big problem bingle tigers eating foresters people
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:18.200]  that work in the jungle in the woods and so for decades they have them in where
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.160]  human mask on the backs of their heads it almost stopped all binger tiger
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.960]  killings saw that on like discovery channel so that's what I'm getting at
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:33.000]  is a gestalt of all that knowledge that if you run into a mountain lion and you
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.560]  go start running from it it's going to probably charge you and knock your legs
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.840]  out from under you and then jump on the back and bite into your neck that's what
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:51.600]  they do so that's my point about groveling to government groveling to
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:27:00.400]  tyranny does not get you ahead going along with the system does not protect
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.760]  you see there's a social compact with a good government adjust system where you
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.520]  want to not stir up trouble go along be nice you know unless you say something
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.920]  it's really serious then you stand up to it and they've gotten us eased into this
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:20.280]  position where we put up with basically anything continuing Marie Lapin and the
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:26.120]  front national surge in French regional elections leader of German anti-immigrant
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.480]  party calls on Merkel to resign mass brawls erupt and crowded migrant
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:37.480]  shelters in Germany uh-oh 14,000 legal migrants in Sweden disappear I said
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:40.680]  12,000 from memory I'm sorry it's worse without a trace just disappear that's
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:45.480]  race I just the latest outrage over Sunni death sentence for poet on blasphemy
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:53.880]  charges won't hear CNN calling for and be released Israel and Greece have come
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.000]  out and said hey Russian jets both passenger and fighter come into our
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.040]  airspace we do it to them sometimes to everybody does this we didn't shoot them
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:07.480]  down Turkey you don't need to shoot down their aircraft so Greeks prime minister
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:12.560]  has blast Turkey on Twitter for shooting down jet the war on terror is
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.520]  creating more terror big article disailing that Ron Paul info wars.com so
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:25.760]  that's just some of the news I've got on that front and it is such a big deal to
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:31.360]  have our government caught with its pants down our hijacked government the
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.840]  criminals that run our government it's our government running ISIS al-Nusra al-Qaeda
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.560]  same group caught so the Russians start bombing their convoy selling hundreds
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:44.120]  of millions of dollars billions total to Turkey and others your guns whose son is
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.600]  involved in the company doing it now that's been confirmed blows up it shoots
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.240]  the Russians yet down blows up a rescue helicopter it says I'm ready for war now
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.600]  they've tried to block the straits and aren't lesing the Russian ships through
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.880]  they completely blocked those ships can come through Turkey blockades Russian
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.760]  shipping black sea fleet completely cut off Turkey has begun to de facto blockade
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:10.360]  of Russian naval vessel that's an act of war preventing transit through the
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:14.640]  straits for the first of Barbados between the black sea and the
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:19.280]  Mediterranean so again that's the straight of Barbados according to the
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.720]  AIS tracking system for the movement of maritime vessels only Turkish vessels
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:28.960]  are moving along the Barbados and in the area there is no movement of any
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.520]  shipping at all so Russia's entrance into the Mediterranean cut off I mean
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:39.400]  this is escalating quickly the Russians are responding to the other opening of
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.240]  the Mediterranean by Gibraltar sending in more warships to launch operation
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.760]  total destruction I'm not kidding that's the name of it oh this sounds
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:53.000]  wonderful we're on the March the Empire's about Caitlyn Jenner how Alex Jones and
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:01.200]  the GCN radio network man made climate change is largely a myth promoted by
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.000]  politicians to scare the public into accepting a vast expansion of government
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.480]  to supposedly stop global warming global warming is a manufactured problem
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.200]  played up by the government to instigate a public reaction in this case fear the
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.800]  government then exploits to offer a predetermined solution the strategy now
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.560]  known as the Hegelian dialectic has been used successfully by politicians for
[01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.800]  millennia to expand government which can only grow at the expense of individual
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.800]  liberties the Bush administration uses strategy successfully in 2003 when it
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.440]  gained enough public support for the invasion of Iraq a claiming country had
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.800]  weapons of mass destruction and the war ultimately expanded the military
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.400]  industrial complex in America's merging police state today global warming is
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.040]  used as a boogeyman because allows the UN to use government funded scientists to
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:44.320]  scare the public into believing that man made climate change is too big of a
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:47.360]  threat for their country to handle alone and thus it's can only be defeated
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.360]  through the expansion of the UN at the expense of their nation's sovereignty
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:53.640]  the number one goal of an out-of-control government is not to protect you but

[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.080]  we've been told the Supreme Court get in line because this is what's gonna happen
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.840]  they have banned free speech in Europe basically they're banning demonstrating
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.920]  against the climate garbage they're bringing in the radical Islamists
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.840]  letting them attack and then taking people's liberties after that happens and
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:52.640]  then grandstanding like heroes but we have seen the Texas Attorney General who's
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.880]  been suing Obama indicted by the Democrats we have seen Republican
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:01.840]  governors indicted for stuff that doesn't look like it's illegal
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:06.160]  Vanessa Suza knew he couldn't fight him for years the feds basically set people
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.440]  up and he pled guilty and served nine months basically in a brainwashing
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:14.440]  facility he can explain to you what happened in one of these quote halfway
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:20.680]  houses when these residential prisons for getting a couple of his friends to
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:23.480]  donate to political campaign and not setting up the proper paperwork for the
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:26.960]  pack so Hillary can get money from foreign dictators at the State
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.400]  Department to sell them arms Hillary can run Benghazi be involved in fast and
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.760]  furious IRS persecution all of it and the national Susan goes to prison and the
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:42.040]  way I've had this explained to me about lawyers and others there's no way to run
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.360]  a company or to be involved in elections and not break a law and they can
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:51.720]  selectively enforce whatever they want they put people in prison folks for
[01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:57.040]  filling out a check amount wrong or bouncing a check now this is how they
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.000]  operate and they're coming after everybody it is so draconian number one
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.520]  best-selling author to national Suza the second largest grossing documentary
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:12.840]  film ever America 2016 and right before his other film was getting produced they
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.880]  put him in jail to try to shut that down and kill the promotion stealing America
[01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.120]  what my experience with criminal gangs taught me about Obama Hillary and the
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:24.960]  Democratic Party and the thing is they're going into a phase of total
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.000]  oppression now so he's a political hero speechwriter and advisor to Ronald
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.640]  Reagan no criminal record graduated you know top of his class from major
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:41.440]  university I'm gonna go over his whole biob and he could be locked up pi beta
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.640]  capo from Dartmouth College and then the rest of it best-selling author
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:53.600]  arrested put in prison no one safe no one but we can't capitulate to this fear
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.520]  we have to stand up to it or we will become a Soviet Union style system
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.400]  that's what they're doing that's what they're pushing Hillary's Fun Camps well
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:04.680]  Danecha Suza's already been sent to Hillary's Fun Camp that's why we say
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.640]  Hillary for prison 2016 Danecha Suza thank you so much for joining us sir hey
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:12.840]  it's good to be on the show well I've already been running for five minutes
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.440]  you've got the floor tell us about your experience the book I mean I think there's
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.560]  to be a film about what they did to you obviously that's probably in the works
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:26.480]  but but right now in this experience what you've gone through yes so at the
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:31.120]  beginning I was exhilarated because I thought that I had beaten the Obama
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:36.320]  administration's effort to send me to federal prison but ironically federal
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.960]  prison would have been white-collar prison with basically nonviolent guys you
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:47.800]  know mayors and doctors who defrauded Medicare and executives and that sort of
[01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:53.600]  thing people who do embezzlers very safe place to be actually but I got
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:57.040]  sentenced to eight months in the confinement center on the Mexican border
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.280]  and turns out that this is a facility where people who have done their prison
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:04.760]  term or at least are close to being done with their prison term come for
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:10.160]  typically 60 or 90 or 180 days transitioning back to society but it's
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.680]  the whole gamut of criminals so you get drug smugglers coyotes you get armed
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.080]  robbery you get guys who've done rape who've done murder so it's the whole
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:23.680]  gamut and this is not a group I'd ever you know needless to say hung out with
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:29.320]  before and so initially I was very much to myself in a kind of huddle but after
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.880]  a while I realized you know what this is an amazing learning opportunity I'm in a
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.320]  very unusual environment let me see if I can learn about this subculture that I
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.080]  know so little about and it turns out that I learned a lot about it and I
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:46.880]  learned a lot about politics that I didn't know before well you've got a
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.880]  lot of good cheer after what you've been through it oh you've written about it
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.840]  being a big learning experience in the book breaks that down but describe to
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.920]  people what you went through why you think they did it and then obviously I
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.400]  mentioned drudge and others the persecution the IRS has engaged in no
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:04.240]  one's gotten in trouble I mean this is probably the greatest political
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:10.600]  repression we've seen in the 240 years of this country it's so naked as far as I
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:15.320]  know there's no one who without a corrupt motive if I didn't stand to gain
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.680]  anything I did this straw donation but the candidate didn't even know about it
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:24.000]  so I wasn't trying to buy influence I was trying to help a longtime college
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.960]  friend now no one who has done that to my knowledge has been facing prison time
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.960]  in the history of the United we ought to get a medal for trying to kick her out
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:35.840]  of the Senate Hillary Clinton I mean you got put in jail for giving money to
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.000]  somebody to try to run against Hillary yeah it was actually against Christian
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.800]  Gillibrand but nevertheless it was for Hillary seat liberal Democrat yeah
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:48.800]  running running for the Senate in New York now here's the point right about the
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:52.680]  same time there was a big Democratic donor a guy named Chatwal another Asian
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:57.600]  Indian guy that turns out like me anyway he gave $180,000 of straw
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:02.480]  donations to Hillary and to a bunch of other Democrats now this guy was trying
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:06.320]  to buy influence in fact he was even found guilty of witness tampering he was
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.160]  trying to get witnesses to lie under oath no prison no confinement so you know
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.720]  justice is not just a matter of hey do you break the law but it's also a matter
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:18.560]  of proportioning the penalty to the crime making sure other guys who did the
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:22.200]  same thing get roughly the same penalty but the progress has been no
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:26.200]  attention to that they are perfectly willing to systematically go after their
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:31.680]  enemies while protecting their friend roll through the book roll through your
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.800]  experience with this criminal gang and then where you see this country going
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.200]  currently well I think that you know I have been I've lived in a sort of almost
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.720]  you could say protected intellectual enclave for most of my life think tanks
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.040]  like the American Enterprise Institute of the Hoover Institution the Reagan
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:52.080]  White House before that president of a college so I tended to write about
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.720]  America you may say idealistically the American founding the principles of
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:02.080]  America the American dream but in prison I began to see another version of
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.200]  American reality and I realized wait a minute you can't compare the American
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.680]  dream to everybody else's reality you've got to compare like with like and so I
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.600]  saw a side of America I didn't know before now I think the thing that opened
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:18.280]  my eyes was that the way that the criminals look at society if they don't
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:22.640]  look at it as a clash of ideas they look at it of it as a clash of interest
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:28.120]  powerful people who who want to gain at the expense of others they think that
[01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:35.120]  human nature is motivated not by the urge to debate but by avarice and lust and
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:40.720]  hatred and revenge and so this was a kind to me an eye-opener because I began to
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:45.680]  see modern progressivism now not just as the quest for social justice the effort
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.920]  to fix the climate no these are just ruses they're similar to what a gang
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.440]  might do when they're trying to convince an old lady to take the latch off the
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.080]  door before they kick the door in go in and take all her stuff they think that
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.160]  those criminals need a sales pitch to lower the guard of the person they're
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.000]  ripping off and so I came to see some of these ideas that have been debating for
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.040]  a long time yes we debate them on the merits but we should also realize that
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:15.680]  these are ruses that are used by the government and by the progressives in the
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:24.560]  government to take power over us to run our lives and to take our stuff I can't
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:29.280]  disagree with what you've said and you when I saw America 2016 I thought it was
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.320]  a good film I thought a lot of it was accurate but I kind of disagreed on air
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:37.680]  instead look Obama's just a globalist elitist he doesn't actually hate America
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:41.120]  he doesn't want to completely sabotage it he just wants to lower it to the level
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.640]  of third world countries and he doesn't really want to you know bring in a
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.040]  Muslim radical invasion and all this and it's not really that bad and I'm kind
[01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:51.560]  of conflating what your film was some of the other things being said by
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:56.560]  conservatives but now watching what they do in Syria and Europe and here and just
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.640]  shutting off the power plants and Obamacare they really have it out for
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:06.400]  this country they really are trying to run a clowered and piven crash the West
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.200]  system so that they can control our lives I mean I don't think there's any
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  doubt these are quite frankly I'm not just saying I agree with you now it's
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:19.120]  worse than I think what you said in your film I think it is worse but I think the
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:22.720]  reason it is worse is there's an element of gangsterism in all this that I
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.360]  didn't see I mean I I basically said Obama is an anti-colonialist but
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:30.600]  anti-colonialism is an ideal it's a vision we may disagree with it but
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:34.720]  ultimately it is the way is a kind of a moral idea for the world Obama thinks
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.000]  the West has been an oppressor he wants to reduce American wealth and power so I
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.920]  think all of that actually is correct but it misses the way that Obama is
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:47.440]  willing to skirt the laws it misses the way in which Obama has this personal
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:51.160]  appetite to have not just to run the government but have to have the
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.640]  government running the private sector so look at the way that the federal
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.320]  government has increased its its control its domination over banks
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:04.880]  investment companies automobile companies health care every hospital now
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:08.400]  they're moving into the energy sector with this free college rules they're
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.200]  now moving into education so they're trying to colonize you might say the
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:16.600]  private economy exactly they're colonizing us with the
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:22.200]  monopoly capitalism on the top but socialism for everybody else exactly and
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:25.680]  they get enormous gains out of it I mean look at the way Hillary went from
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:30.200]  Bureau to 200 million dollars at warp speed the Clintons didn't invent the
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.560]  iPhone they didn't come up with a product that everybody wants to buy they
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:38.000]  figured out how to make politics pay for them big time now in Arkansas they were
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.400]  doing that in a small scale but once they got to the federal government you
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.840]  know we've had corruption at the local level we had Tammany Hall in New York the
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:51.880]  Daily Racket in Chicago but never before has a Secretary of State figured out how
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.320]  can I rent out American foreign policy the Russian oligarchs and Canadian
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:00.360]  billionaires and people who want to have oil interest in Africa how can I make
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:04.640]  money off of the world even in the poorest spots like Haiti you think there's
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.320]  no money in Haiti well wait a minute there's aid money in Haiti a lot of it
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.200]  flowing from the US government so if Clinton becomes the administrator of
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:16.160]  that aid and Hillary is a Secretary of State I mean this is like putting Bonnie
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:21.240]  and Clyde in charge of the you know fix Haiti operation needless to say a great
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:28.280]  deal of money goes to the fixer what do we do about this because I agree with you
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.560]  I was dumbfounded I didn't like John McCain I didn't like cuz he's about
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:38.720]  like Obama in many levels I didn't like Barry Saturo aka Barack Obama whoever
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.400]  he is but I thought you know maybe this will bring some racial unity and maybe
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.000]  the Democrats will I mean I know they're gonna come after our guns all the rest of
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.680]  it I thought who could be worse than Clintons so I kind of sat on the
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:56.960]  sidelines in that election but well man now seeing Obama in everything he's
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.080]  doing it's really scary the consolidation of power and to realize that
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:06.960]  they're trying to sew this country up and really are engaging in totalitarian
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:12.920]  type activities the Obama and Hillary I think are in a different ballgame than
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:16.480]  Bill Clinton and of course Bill himself is in a different league than let's say
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.240]  Jimmy Carter or the earlier Democrats I mean no one would say that Jimmy Carter
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:24.600]  came to the presidency to make money now Hillary did say you know and people
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.000]  after there when she said we were dead broke but it is true that the Clintons
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.240]  like the Obama's came to Washington without any money and they have
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:36.640]  accumulated a vast amount of money now I think the key difference to me between
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.880]  let's say Bill and Hillary is that Bill's appetite is limited by his own
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:45.040]  personal desire I mean he wants a big office he wants to be top dog he wants
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:49.480]  three women a day he wants cocaine three women yeah but once you once he has all
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:54.320]  that that's the circumference of his desires and he's happy Hillary on the
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.400]  other hand wants to run things she wants to tell people who are drilling in
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:02.560]  Texas where they can drill and what they should do with their the oil that
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.160]  they take out of the ground Hillary wants to run our lives she's a kind of
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.560]  busy body in a way that Bill is not look at how she's trying to shut down the
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.680]  laugh factory officially threatening them to shut them down if they make
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.680]  jokes about her I mean that is incredible absolutely incredible and so this is a
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.640]  level of in some ways I think Hillary's maybe even worse than Obama and the
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:28.800]  reason for this is that Obama's goals I think are ideological but he's willing
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:32.760]  to be gangsterish about the way he gets there so his goal for example is let's
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:36.080]  say for to bring illegals into this country and then swell the ranks of
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:39.840]  Democratic voters that's the goal but that has an ideological component to
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.360]  change the complexion of America to you know give give it back to the Mexicans
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:48.040]  because we took their land blah blah blah now in order to get there Obama's
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.280]  willing to use to skirt the law so he's willing to ignore what the Supreme
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:56.200]  Court says he'll ignore the dictates of Congress but the gangsterism is on route
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:00.240]  to achieving an ideological goal whereas with Hillary I think gangsterism is
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:05.120]  the goal she basically wants to be the first female mob boss of America and
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:08.840]  and that's her goal and so she's gangsterish both in the way she goes
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.280]  about it and also in the in the goal she wants to achieve she is a
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:18.400]  ball breaker yes and I also you have to I mean from a distance we have to
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:23.040]  admire her tenacity all of the stuff would have sunk any other candidate but
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:27.080]  she puts her head down doggedly tenaciously basically she there there's
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:30.280]  the American people she goes you have to bludgeon me to the ground and then sit
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:34.440]  on me otherwise I'm gonna keep going well look at the things she's done
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.640]  Brian Williams couldn't survive lying about being shot at in a helicopter she
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:42.720]  says they're shot at at a C-130 that she's shot it on the ground and there's
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:47.640]  video CBS News nothing happened total lies no war going on for hundreds of
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:52.160]  miles just a total fraud and then you just stack the other day I was thinking
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:56.040]  about Hillary doing a video about her crimes I was going back through my
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:01.000]  memory and and thing it was so many scandals so much corruption defending
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.280]  Clinton and the unsettling rape cases just it literally goes on and on then
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:09.400]  to watch Gloria Steinem and the Democrats defender no matter what really
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:13.080]  lets you know how evil these people are and how they defend persecuting thousands
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:16.880]  of churches and in conservative groups and veterans groups and and you know
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:21.200]  even arresting people and then in the MSNBC Maddow and others I've seen them
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:25.280]  go well of course we're going after the Tea Party with the IRS you're racist I
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:29.560]  mean they're openly like the Nazis and people use Nazi analogies too much but
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:33.040]  let me tell you the Nazis nakedly got up and said let's start arresting people
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:37.120]  for their views and that's what they're now doing we're seeing arrest people that
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:40.880]  deny global warming I mean they're having national polls these people are
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:44.920]  freakish I mean I've got to say it even the average Democratic follower down was
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:50.040]  more like a brown shirt crazed little rat and I've never hated Democrats but I
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:55.920]  gotta tell you they are really a freakish dangerous motley crew well what
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:01.120]  really I what I found really protect Hillary is the fact that she's got the
[01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:05.360]  mainstream media to cover for her I don't just mean not to report on her but
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.440]  to actively cover from her and that's really what Nixon didn't have Nixon has
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:14.000]  a media against him and so his crimes were on the front page and he was an
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.240]  angel compared to them because he wasn't a good liar he was small potatoes
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:22.880]  compared to Hillary when I was when I went in for my sentencing every
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:28.360]  journalist in the room knew that a double standard is underway here and yet I
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:32.560]  could just see the joy in their faces the anticipation they were so excited
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.760]  about the idea of me being locked up and then they look so dismayed when a
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:40.160]  Clinton judge refused to send me to federal prison they walked out of the
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:44.440]  room crushed but at least they get to put you kind of in the brainwashing
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:48.000]  who's cow if he wrote some articles describing what it was like and they
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.320]  want you to go to psychological testing now no psychological history no criminal
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:56.240]  record up to that point done nothing presidential adviser and then the judge
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:00.760]  wants to send you so they can I guess try to diagnose you with something well
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:04.320]  if I you know if I was like Jeffrey Dahmer and ended up with bodies my
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:08.840]  refrigerator it would be understandable I need to have my head examined but here
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:14.080]  I was giving money to a college friend and and doing it without any prospect of
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:18.920]  gain and doing it for an obvious motive we've been friends for 25 years one of
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:22.240]  the first people I got to know when I came to America as an exchange student
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:27.400]  from India so this really did what wasn't a complex psychological offense and so
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:32.600]  it's really odd I had almost a year of mandatory psychiatric testing and
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:37.920]  counseling happily that process has now been stopped but even so the very fact
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:42.200]  that it that I went through it it felt a little bit like a re-education project
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:45.640]  well isn't that what the Soviets did I mean that's that's how they started it
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:49.120]  was making people that didn't like corruption is saying go see this shrink
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:52.160]  and then a decade later it was let's send you to a forced labor camp like
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:57.120]  Alexander Shelton Easton yes I mean look there are good people left in
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.440]  America I went to see a government mandated psychiatrist so I was ordered to
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.000]  do it by the judge I walked in the room and the guy goes are you that guy to
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.840]  Susan and I go yeah he goes what the heck are you doing here I go well I've been
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:13.440]  ordered to come here for a psychiatric evaluation and then I told him what it
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:17.680]  was for and the guy just laughed and laughed and laughed and he basically said
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:22.800]  okay well he does I get the picture he saw right away sure that's the good
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:26.040]  news I agree I see that as well I see that as well but what about the younger
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:29.880]  students now that's probably a classical liberal what about the young ones now
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:33.680]  that want people arrested for their speech and are taking over the colleges
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:38.000]  is that not one of the most frightening authoritarian veins we see in this country
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.800]  I think it is you know when I was a student a generation ago we had we had
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:47.160]  the leftists who had come you know fresh from the 60s but there was an older
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.600]  generation of the classical liberals who exercised a moderating influence and I
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.360]  think what's different now is that that generation has passed on it's gone and
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:00.400]  so these radical leftists now in many places are fully in charge and so we
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.880]  are beginning to see this really chilling kind of brains a brainwashing
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.480]  operation going on with young people the full idea you're entitled to free
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:12.400]  college now remember that's a scam because you know the federal government
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:16.280]  can't pay for everybody's free college they're gonna have to borrow money the
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.280]  national debt is gonna go up the same young people who want free college is
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.440]  gonna inherit that national debt so all that Obama is doing is he's reaching in
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:28.640]  the young people's back pocket listing their wallet taking their future it's
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:33.160]  another form of student loan but also they say the first two years to sucker
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:37.560]  you into it and then they're just gonna balloon the charges later and the more
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:42.040]  money you put into education the more expensive it gets that's exactly right
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:45.880]  and it's not even robbing Peter to pay Paul in this case it's robbing Paul to
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:50.840]  pay Paul but they still want to imagine they're gonna win the lottery ticket it's
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:55.640]  just get rich quick type of attitude yeah and and and what's in it for the
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:59.480]  progressives what's in it for them is that they get to colonize another huge
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:03.440]  sector of the economy so that it's not the government people say the government
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:06.560]  will control it's not the government it's the people in government guys like
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:11.440]  Obama become like tycoons and they become tycoons on a scale never before
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:16.200]  imagined they become oligarch yeah Bill Gates of Steve Jobs has very little
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:20.760]  power over your life or mine they have to convince us to go buy their stuff but
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:24.720]  these oligarchs are like Napoleon they can order you they can arrest you they
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:28.160]  can take your money they can go into your account they can put the FBI on you
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:32.600]  they've got enormous sure and yet the act as a business is the problem and
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:35.240]  they're getting to where they're more comfortable doing it like you said the
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:40.080]  press was there yay arrest him oh prison get the next oh I mean seeing their own
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:44.880]  First Amendment annihilated in front of them true political persecution naked and
[01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:49.720]  they so disconnected they relished the tyranny well I want to commend you the

[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:06.280]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:13.080]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:18.440]  Daniels infowars.com here at the French Quarter in New Orleans Louisiana I
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:22.920]  came across a what I'd call an info wars booths now here's the proprietor of
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:26.960]  that booth what's your name sir I'll go Sam and tell me what brought you to do
[02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:32.080]  this well the inspiration was from Alex Jones three years ago I built the first
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:37.960]  prototype of this and didn't know what to expect I used to work for a newspaper
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:43.000]  here called the New Orleans Levy we don't hold anything back so it's a
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.240]  political satirical rag and we got up to about a hundred thousand readers so I
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:53.000]  actually had politicians afraid of me here and I caught the bug so I was
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.560]  looking at throwing a new curve I was going what isn't other people doing you
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:04.480]  know I said well I want to take the best that technology has to offer and then
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:08.240]  bring it out to the streets where revolutions are always fought it's
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:11.960]  kind of reminds me the you know the the newspapers back the Revolutionary
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:16.000]  War you know you had like hundreds of them across the 13 colonies that were
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.080]  speaking freely against King George III and I've been read somewhere that the
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:23.560]  Thomas Paine if it wasn't for him we might not even had a revolution what do
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:27.160]  you think about that well that's exactly it I mean this is all coming from my
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:34.320]  student of history myself that's why I love the show and that's your that's
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:38.720]  where it's all coming from it's the streets it's bringing it to the streets
[02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:42.480]  is trying to connect with people that would not normally see it this is
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.800]  tacking up the notice on the city hall it's interesting that you say that
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:52.400]  because I read a study recently about communicating with people and they say
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.640]  that texting people or face you're talking to them through email it's like
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.360]  the worst way to communicate people they don't see as a person but when you talk
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.080]  to someone it's a little bit better when you talk to someone on the phone but
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:04.960]  even more better than that is when you talk to someone face-to-face like you're
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:08.600]  doing right now I think it's like the study says very more effective I'm at
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:14.600]  the part this is the this is the square this is a want to confront I'm offering
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:19.400]  ten to one odds right now I have a hundred dollar bill I wave around I say
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:24.880]  a ten to one odds was Hillary fired for unethical behavior and lying so
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:28.000]  anybody want to take me up on that I still got the hundred dollar bill this
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.120]  is beautiful I film this stuff I YouTube it you know it's the kind and the
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:36.360]  surprises I've had out here because you never knew who you're gonna speak to on
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:41.760]  the streets I've talked to kernels and cardinals out here so and people have to

[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:08.040]  of this whole Namaki of alien divide and conquer and my end game on this is
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:13.880]  eventually I want to have two TV screens on either side of this so I can

[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:45.920]  it's okay this is the streets of New Orleans I am I mean I just this one of
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:51.320]  the street people come by they humbles me street people at their homes can buy
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.840]  I can't take their money but they'll put a dollar in there right it blows my
[02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:01.040]  mind and it yeah across the board what can I say it's the streets so yeah I
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:12.000]  today I talked to a captain yesterday I talked to a major last week I talked to
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.640]  another major I mean I'm a magnet for military and police but mostly I'm
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:20.320]  talking police on vacation with their families which is great because then they
[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:24.400]  you know they're a little looser I you to these you can go to my channel and
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:31.280]  say it's Mr. Koto it's a knacker name for coalition of the obvious alright so
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:37.680]  it's called a wordpress now my YouTube channel is Mr. Koto and that's where you
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:41.680]  can see a lot of the interview I do out here the interviews I do out here and
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:46.080]  some of the confrontations I had someone throw a drink at me today or at the booth
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:53.440]  anyway laughed it was a $12 drink that was their loss you see first here in
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:05:01.160]  New Orleans but Turkey's reportedly blocking Russian ships from sailing
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:04.360]  through the Strait of Bosporus near Istanbul which links the Black Sea to
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:07.600]  Mediterranean right now only Turkish naval vessels are moving through the
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:12.040]  Bosporus whereas Russian ships are just sitting nearby waiting to pass this is
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:15.160]  a huge deal that could easily lead to a war because Russia is going to feel
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:19.040]  threatened if it's boxed in for one thing this prevents Russia's Black Sea fleet
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:21.840]  from traveling to the rest of the world or even back to its home port
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:25.680]  meanwhile Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered 150,000 Russian troops
[02:05:25.680 --> 02:05:29.720]  deployed into Syria while also sending another 7,000 Russian troops with tanks
[02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:33.520]  rocket launchers and artillery to the Russian Turkish border with orders to be
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:37.400]  fully combat ready here's the scary part even though Turkey initiated standoff
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:40.160]  with Russia by intentionally shooting down a Russian jet near the Syrian
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:44.440]  border it can evoke article 5 in the NATO treaty which requires all NATO members
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:48.320]  including the US to come to its defense if Turkey goes to war with Russia if
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.960]  there's going to be another world war this is precisely how it would start keep

[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:06.520]  behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:10.600]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:15.000]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.680]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:24.320]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.920]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:32.120]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:35.600]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take we
[02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:39.000]  worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:42.520]  for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:47.400]  out there introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile

[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:57.120]  today and info wars life dot com that's child ease exclusively at info wars life
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:25.960]  dot com fortune favors the bold it's Alex Jones as we all know the Obama
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:29.920]  administration continues to fund groups like the Syrian rebels many of whom
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:32.860]  aren't even Syrian and most of whom have actually sworn their allegiance to
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:37.200]  al-Qaeda we've also seen groups like ISIS have grenades and rocket launchers
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.400]  airdrop to them courtesy of Western governments now of course the officials
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:45.560]  say that this is a mistake and when probably blew the grenades and rocket
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:49.440]  launchers off course one person was even so bold as to say this this is Army
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:53.360]  Lieutenant Colonel Steve Warren one bundle worth of equipment is not enough
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:57.240]  equipment to give the enemy any type of advantage at all now I'm sure that
[02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:00.040]  rains true when you're fighting a mighty force such as the United States
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.040]  military but I don't think that's true when you're fighting unarmed
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:06.440]  civilians in Syria and when you don't feel safe in your own country you want
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:09.960]  to move understandably so they're coming to America they're coming to Austin
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:13.680]  Texas and one place in particular they're going to school Alex Jones is
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:19.160]  alma mater Anderson high school local news is reporting for the 2013 to 2014
[02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:24.600]  school year 675 refugee students began attending Austin ISD schools and that
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:28.400]  number is only expected to grow now with more Arabic-speaking students they
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:32.320]  need more Arabic-speaking tutors and you have tutors coming from places like
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:36.520]  University of Texas to volunteer to teach the kids and one of the tutors said
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:39.640]  that the kids are being bullied in their peers really don't understand what's
[02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:43.480]  going on she says that the kids are being called things like ISIS and terrorists
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:47.480]  even though they're fleeing from ISIS and terrorists but we do have concerns of
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:51.240]  ISIS and the actual terrorists coming here because of improper vetting
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:55.120]  procedures in our immigration policy we're here outside the Texas Department of
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.280]  Public Safety to illustrate all the stringent measures it takes for an
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:02.120]  American citizen to acquire a driver's license now this is in stark contrast to
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.360]  tens of thousands people who are coming into the country with little to no
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:08.920]  vetting process I do support people who come here through legal and lawful
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:12.480]  means but we've seen top advisors in Washington tell the president Mr.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.640]  President we can't verify everybody that you're bringing into the country when
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.640]  you bring them in tens of thousands at a time now to that let's take a look at
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.040]  what you need to get a driver's license you need proof of vehicle insurance
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.400]  proof of US citizenship or lawful presence proof of identity proof of
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:32.200]  residency in Texas and proof of a social security number so all in all we're
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:35.280]  making the point that this is what we have to go through to move about freely
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:38.760]  in our own country when other people come in with little to no vetting process
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:46.360]  at all you can find more reports on info wars.com according to the EU even
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:53.120]  themselves upwards of 80% of the men are military age it's 80 plus percent men
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:59.560]  but most of our military age and over 70% of their passports the Germans said
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:05.400]  last month I think it was 76% they said you can look it up are fake they're not
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:09.080]  Syrian and some of these people been fingerprinted before in the digital
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:13.600]  databases because they are terrorists they're criminals and they're from
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:17.400]  Pakistan they're from Saudi Arabia they're from North Africa they are jihadis
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:27.360]  now Anderson the paper reported got 300 of the 600 plus in the first wave so
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:31.320]  Governor Abbott wrote letters to Obama two weeks ago saying we're not taking
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:37.080]  refugees in Texas well Obama said I don't need your authorization and said
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:48.400]  by the way I won't tell the DPS the state police where I'm sending them because
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:51.760]  they don't want the DPS investigating and they've got them already going missing
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:57.400]  in Austin Texas they admit and imagine these people haven't paid taxes property
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:03.080]  taxes and you've got to pay for them now I want to explain something there are
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:07.560]  real refugees there are a lot of great Iraqis in fact I have a good friend who
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:10.840]  was actually an Iraqi refugee that I went to school with at Anderson High
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:14.120]  School just talked to him on the phone the other day saw him and I was out eating
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:17.320]  dinner a few months ago we're gonna get together have lunch sometime they built
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:23.240]  buildings they're in construction but they were from the elite of Iraq and
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:28.600]  were Shiites but also didn't like Saddam and didn't like the Sunnis and I'm not
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:32.960]  discriminatory I'm sure Muslims are great people in my experience the Shiites
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:37.720]  I've met are nice people and then when I met Sunnis they're pretty bossy and in
[02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:41.400]  your face and arrogant and everything else I'm not that's just my experience
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:44.120]  it's kind of like female cops most my problem with female cops because I'll
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:47.560]  be doing nothing and they just are in my face screaming at me and I'm just like
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:50.480]  whoa you got something to prove don't you because I'm not looking for trouble
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:55.000]  here just treat me like a human being get off your arrogant high horse but a lot
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.960]  of women have become police have a chip on their shoulder it's like the
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:02.920]  Napoleonic complex I mean some of those obnoxious people I've run into are
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:05.640]  short guys they're starting fights with the biggest guy in the room they got
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:09.120]  something to prove and I'm not that tall like 511 they don't have the you know
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:13.760]  Napoleon complex and I'll give it to some of these little guys they can really
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:18.480]  fight it's like a Chihuahua you know Boston a bigger dog around but I'm not
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:21.560]  bashing female cops I've met some great ones believe me that's some female
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:27.240]  detectives other folks that really nice and smart but there is statistically
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:34.160]  statistically a problem with female cops small small percentage but it's still a
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:38.280]  larger percentage and of course you get greenhorn guys that are on power trips
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.320]  and in people's faces but but I'm kind of digressing it's like the stereotype
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:46.880]  that a new cop is gonna be a lot is gonna have more trouble than an old cop
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:51.040]  and it's just true doesn't mean there's some bad old cops absolutely but
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:55.520]  generally the power trip if there was one tends to wear off after a few years
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:00.560]  when you see dead babies and car wrecks and you know if you got into it for a
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:11.680]  power trip you're gonna probably get out pretty quick so governor Abbott says
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:17.160]  we want to know where these people are going no you don't get to know I mean the
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:22.520]  state police have got a file on me I'm told that is a whole filing cabinet but
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:28.720]  there's gonna be no files on these people and most of the refugees coming in out
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:33.600]  of Iraq and out of Syria are Sunni and they're invaders who have not been able
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:36.960]  to take over and what they do is they move in they take over your house or
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:40.600]  swimming pool your family they kill you in the backyard this is what happens in
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:45.320]  Syria over 300,000 people now 200,000 Christians they come in they line you up
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:49.720]  they kill you they rape your daughters sell them in the sex slavery on record
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:55.000]  they're selling them all over the world now because in a lot of these Islamic
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.560]  countries they claim you know will execute you for adultery but no one
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:03.320]  enforces it and then they've got harems of women populous dancers in people I see
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:06.200]  at the news all the time well now it's political and corrects they don't talk
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:11.240]  about it get tricked or get roped into flying with some sheik or whatever
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:16.480]  there's like 10,000 plus you know with Saudi princes the low level ones get like
[02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:22.720]  20 30 billion a year the top ones billions a year of taxpayer money
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:29.800]  10,000 plus and these guys run around so snot-nosed it'll make your head spin the
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:35.280]  arrogance that the craziness and these women get on their jets they fly and
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:40.160]  they land in Saudi Arabia they take them to their palace and they go okay here
[02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:43.440]  are these men armed guards here's your area here's your nice area and they just
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:49.320]  shove them in there and it's bye bye sweetie glorious diamond gonna say jack
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:55.800]  squad because the CIA runs that lady and she was there to make sure you were
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.040]  raised as dumb as could be and there were no men around you to protect you
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:03.680]  it's not that women need protecting everybody needs protecting I got a dad
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.360]  at a mother but I could call it 3 a.m. and they would swim in a river climbing
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:12.400]  mountain probably do more than that and I'll just leave it at that my dad would
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:21.200]  do anything I asked him to do anything that's loyalty I've got a crew I've got
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:26.440]  a family I've got a tribe bloods thicker than water
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:30.760]  they these women are completely alone these men are alone all they've got
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:35.400]  TV to teach them how to act like idiots and be moral morons and they just
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:41.920]  watching a fantasy friends on TV talk about a dead culture you talk about
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:50.120]  being in a trance 300 children at a high school that I mean I went to that high
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:54.240]  school it's a small it's one of the smallest in in Austin they haven't built
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:17:00.880]  on to it it's little I mean it's got to be there's no way there's more than 1500
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:05.520]  can we look up the enrollment at Anderson high the Trojans
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:14.000]  and the reason Anderson got it is it was always a feeder school and it's got
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.840]  the relationships they had a retired Army general ran it when I was there
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:24.960]  total Spookville that's the thing people just don't know about in for guard the
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:28.680]  infrastructure and how the whole country is run by secret networks I'm just so
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:34.880]  tired of it and and let me tell you something folks I stood up against the
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:39.000]  wars against the Middle East because they blame the wrong country for 9-11 and
[02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:50.040]  I was against the Iraq war but I'm here to tell you we are being attacked we're
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.840]  going to be attacked more they're bringing in the radical groups that are
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:58.080]  going to attack this nation and it's part of a destabilization program and they
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:11.640]  need to be held accountable but instead what they're doing is grandstanding
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:14.560]  when they're the ones that brought the folks into Paris and then saying we're
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:18.400]  gonna pass this global treaty and defiance of you attacking and I guess
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:20.800]  those high schools gotten bigger I don't know where they put everybody but
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:32.400]  there's 2,287 students there three I guess they had a 300 300 of them are
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.720]  from the Middle East and that's just in the last month can you imagine if my
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:44.320]  high school got 300 plus people in the last month can you imagine what else is
[02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:48.960]  going around the city I bet you money I bet you my right arm it's more than 600
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:55.480]  you know the Austin American statesman saying 600 in Austin I bet it's 5,000
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:59.520]  and how do I know stuff like that it's just like I said when Obama said it's
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:02.400]  gonna be 10,000 migrants then I said it'll be a hundred thousand then it'll
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:08.640]  be 300,000 that's now all been announced 100 went from a 10,000 to 100,000 they're
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:12.360]  now saying they're looking at 300,000 or a half million so it's worse than I said
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:16.680]  they're now saying half million because Germany it's the same formula we're gonna
[02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:22.040]  take five years ago 10,000 migrants 100,000 200,000 300,000 a million two
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:24.920]  million three million four million five million it's up to like five million now
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.920]  total couple million the last year and they go hey Germans you got a hundred
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:37.160]  thousand people in your town will bring in 200,000 migrants you got a town of a
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:40.920]  hundred and two people will bring in 350 those are the metrics when you're
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:45.680]  just like and they tell everybody everyone line up you're going to change
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:51.200]  the badge of the migrants and the kids elementary in high school go in and the
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:55.240]  and the migrants just lay around bitching and then you fold their beds and
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:59.360]  everything next will be wiped their heinies grooms of the stool something
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:02.920]  just happened that is explained why survival food is literally flying off
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:07.120]  the shelves and has sold out in many areas of the country it caught me totally
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:11.960]  by surprise and it involves FEMA I couldn't believe FEMA tried this until I
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:16.040]  saw proof revealing their secret could land me in hot water but I think you

[02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:34.340]  The Auto.
[02:24:35.840 --> 02:24:42.340]  You get that James Bond clip from the 60s where Spectre is explaining how they put the two Siamese fighting fish together,
[02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.340]  where one kills the other but gets weakened.
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:49.340]  And then the other smart one comes in and kills the tired out one.
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:54.340]  That's what this divide and conquer strategy is.
[02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:56.340]  While the globalists play all the countries off against each other,
[02:24:56.340 --> 02:25:00.340]  tiring us out, bankrupting us, having us all kill each other.
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:03.340]  And after there's 20 or 30 Islamic attacks in the US and Europe,
[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:05.340]  there'll be a bombing campaign.
[02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:09.340]  They'll go blow up some innocent country and then use more refugees to come in.
[02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:14.340]  I mean, again, you see the deliberateness.
[02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:20.340]  I don't care if we get real immigrants to this country that are scientists, doctors, lawyers, artists.
[02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.340]  But let me tell you something.
[02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:27.340]  I go downtown for business and I'm down there and downtown Austin many times looks like Islamabad or something.
[02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:35.340]  And these are folks that aren't assimilating.
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:40.340]  These are folks that constantly fight with each other in the Middle East.
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:46.340]  These are people that are killing their daughters in America because they don't put a headdress on.
[02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:56.340]  And they have mixed with weird political correctness with an arrogance and a chip on their shoulder.
[02:25:56.340 --> 02:26:03.340]  Even Defense Department reports admit that it's like merged with hip hop gangsterism into this mutated weirdness.
[02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:09.340]  So it's like these arrogant hip hop gangster type folks who hate the West and have chips on their shoulders
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:14.340]  that the West attack their countries when it's the same globalists that attack their countries.
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:22.340]  Paul Watson's coming up the fourth hour today.
[02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:24.340]  He reveals the true agenda behind the Paris climate summit.
[02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:26.340]  It's a very important report.
[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:31.340]  Global warming alarmists have been proven spectacularly wrong time and time again.
[02:26:31.340 --> 02:26:33.340]  So why should we believe them now?
[02:26:33.340 --> 02:26:36.340]  Everybody debates and proves it's a fraud.
[02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:39.340]  We already proved it was a fraud 100 times plus.
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:40.340]  Literally.
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:42.340]  We got their internal emails admitting it's all a fraud.
[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:44.340]  It's a giant tax.
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:49.340]  Letting China build power plants but we can't is not fair.
[02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:51.340]  And then you learn they've got dirty ones and ours are clean.
[02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:55.340]  Then you realize it's all fraud.
[02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:57.340]  It's a death sentence to the third world.
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:01.340]  I'm not against these third world populations. I want to build their countries up industrialize them.
[02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:04.340]  Then they'll be so wealthy. Maybe I'll go live there.
[02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:09.340]  But see that's not the way this works.
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:14.340]  Here is the clip from Russia with love with Sean Connery.
[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:18.340]  And here is the head of specter explaining how things really work.
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:29.340]  Here it is.
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:33.340]  Siamese fighting fish. Fascinating creatures.
[02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:36.340]  Grave but of the whole stupid.
[02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:38.340]  Yes, they're stupid.
[02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:42.340]  Except for the occasional one such as we have here.
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:46.340]  Let's the other two fight.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:52.340]  And he waits.
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:58.340]  Waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.
[02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:03.340]  And then like specter, he strikes.
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:06.340]  I find the parallel amusing.
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:11.340]  Our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement.
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:15.340]  Number three.
[02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:21.340]  Sit down number three while we listen to what number five is devised for us.
[02:28:21.340 --> 02:28:27.340]  I hope Kronstein's efforts as director of planning will continue to be as successful as his chess.
[02:28:27.340 --> 02:28:35.340]  They will be. According to your instructions, I've planned for specter to steal from the Russians their new lecture decoding machine.
[02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:43.340]  For this we need the services of a female member of the Russian cryptograph section in Turkey and the help of the British secret service.
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:49.340]  Naturally, neither the Russians nor the British will be aware that they are now working for us.
[02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:52.340]  Number three is your section ready to carry out Kronstein's course.
[02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:56.340]  This was written by a high level member of MI6. It's all in your face.
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:29:03.340]  A couple of James Bond's ago, they have the one with her in South America and they actually cut off the water to starve everybody.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:06.340]  So the economy goes on. They can then turn the water back on and everything.
[02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:09.340]  That was based on a economic hit man report.
[02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:16.340]  A real thing that happened. I think it was like Bolivia. I mean, this is what they do.
[02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:24.340]  Worldwide to tax and trace all human activity, surveil it and control it and then openly say this company can't operate.
[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:28.340]  This company can. You can generate carbon. You can.
[02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:33.340]  With the Communist Chinese running the satellites for Al Gore.
[02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:37.340]  That's in the news today that will track the quote carbon emissions.
[02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:41.340]  But of course the Chinese, the muscle of this takeover exempt.
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:43.340]  Russia is targeted for take now.
[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:47.340]  Joe Scow doesn't agree with that analysis yesterday.
[02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:51.340]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:51.340 --> 02:30:08.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network Turkey's reportedly blocking Russian ships from sailing through the Strait of Bosporus near Istanbul, which links the Black Sea to Mediterranean.
[02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:11.340]  Right now, only Turkish naval vessels are moving through the Bosporus, whereas Russian ships are just sitting nearby waiting to pass.
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:16.340]  This is a huge deal that could easily lead to a war because Russia is going to feel threatened if it's boxed in.
[02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:21.340]  For one thing, this prevents Russia's Black Sea fleet from traveling to the rest of the world or even back to its home port.
[02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:34.340]  Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered 150,000 Russian troops deployed into Syria while also sending another 7,000 Russian troops with tanks, rocket launchers and artillery to the Russian Turkish border with orders to be fully combat ready.
[02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:35.340]  Here's the scary part.
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:45.340]  Even though Turkey initiated its standoff with Russia by intentionally shooting down a Russian jet near the Syrian border, it can invoke Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which requires all NATO members including the U.S.
[02:30:45.340 --> 02:30:48.340]  to come to its defense if Turkey goes to war with Russia.
[02:30:48.340 --> 02:30:51.340]  If there's going to be another World War, this is precisely how it would start.

[02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:00.340]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:04.340]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:07.340]  You know what?
[02:33:07.340 --> 02:33:11.340]  I actually think the people running the government have our best interest at heart.
[02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:16.340]  I actually think it's a good idea to have a good time with them.
[02:33:16.340 --> 02:33:20.340]  I think it's a good idea to have a good time with them.
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:23.340]  I think it's a good idea to have a good time with them.
[02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:28.340]  Running the government have our best interest at heart.
[02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:30.340]  I actually think it's a good idea to have a good time with them.
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:35.340]  The UN has been calling all over the world addling steroids to tetanus shots.
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:42.340]  I think it's nice they admit tens of thousands of lethal tests on American citizens and other citizens of the world.
[02:33:45.340 --> 02:33:48.340]  They're not dark minds we face.
[02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:54.340]  In your gut you know they love you.
[02:34:03.340 --> 02:34:08.340]  Who was it that said don't stare too long into the abyss unless you become the abyss.
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:14.340]  Move your eyes look deep in your soul step outside yourself and let your mind go.
[02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:17.340]  You must stare into the abyss to know the truth.
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:23.340]  But you will never be the same.
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:28.340]  Because our enemies have gone insane.
[02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:31.340]  Go insane!
[02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:33.340]  Hey!
[02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:38.340]  Hear their war drums?
[02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:42.340]  That's the beat of the new war.
[02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:44.340]  The commitment of pirates.
[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:47.340]  They're gonna take over everything you've got.
[02:34:55.340 --> 02:35:00.340]  Whoever fights monsters should seem to it that in the process he does not become a monster.
[02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:05.340]  And if you gaze long enough into an abyss the abyss will gaze back at you.
[02:35:05.340 --> 02:35:07.340]  Frederick Nietzsche.
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:15.340]  They want to close the eyes on our republic forever.
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:18.340]  They want to kill the renaissance the human enlightenment.
[02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:24.340]  Because that is the ultimate insanity of the enemy.
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:31.340]  Instead of building others up they would play God.
[02:35:31.340 --> 02:35:34.340]  But no God at all would do what they do.
[02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:36.340]  They are fallen.
[02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:38.340]  Alright.
[02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:40.340]  I want to get into more of the news.
[02:35:41.340 --> 02:35:45.340]  I specifically am not taking calls today because I want to get to more news.
[02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:47.340]  But I will be tomorrow and throughout the week.
[02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:50.340]  We have some very big guests this week coming up.
[02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:54.340]  And that's all I'm gonna say. We have some big guests this week.
[02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:56.340]  You will not want to miss this week's broadcast.
[02:35:57.340 --> 02:35:59.340]  Plus look at all the stuff that's happening in the world.
[02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:01.340]  I mean it's just crazy.
[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:05.340]  It's a very important time to be focused, to be involved, and to be educating others.
[02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:08.340]  Because you're the other part of the equation getting the war out to others.
[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:18.340]  And obviously we also have some of our reporters going on a secret mission.
[02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:22.340]  And we're not gonna tell you where they are until they're there.
[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:25.340]  And then we're not gonna tell you where they're going next.
[02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:32.340]  But they're going five places in America, in the United States.
[02:36:32.340 --> 02:36:36.340]  Five places in the next seven days.
[02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:40.340]  Five places.
[02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:49.340]  They're going to be live on air with us with video feeds for the TV viewing audience.
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:51.340]  We'll be narrating it for the radio listeners.
[02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:58.340]  So be ready for Joe Biggs and crew to be on the ground.
[02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:03.340]  Showing you and me and everybody else exactly what's going on.
[02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:04.340]  That's coming up.
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:11.340]  Before I get back into news, this is something that I really like and something that I've really used
[02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:16.340]  to jumpstart a car, to have a power for a whole bunch of devices.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:18.340]  They really come out with better batteries.
[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:22.340]  And I was able because we bought a large amount of these.
[02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:24.340]  That's what I am, a free market capitalist.
[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:26.340]  I buy a ton of something.
[02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:27.340]  That's how it works.
[02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:30.340]  You gotta spend a lot of money to be able to make money to fund the operation.
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.340]  Also sell people stuff that's really good.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:37.340]  We sell this for less than what Amazon sells it and anybody else.
[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:39.340]  It wouldn't matter if it was, you know, cost more.
[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:45.340]  I mean, you're helping fund the Info War, but we believe in getting you a great product and getting it to you below cost.
[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:48.340]  You'll notice it says Info Wars premium power pack.
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:51.340]  This is one of the best selling units in the country currently.
[02:37:51.340 --> 02:37:55.340]  When we're done selling this stuff in six months, there'll probably be something even better out by then.
[02:37:55.340 --> 02:37:56.340]  This stuff advances so quickly.
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:01.340]  But when we made this deal a few months ago and had these manufactured, this is the best deal you're going to get.
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:05.340]  Info Wars premium power pack, $119.
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:08.340]  It's $160 for the same pack most places.
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:10.340]  Amazon's $140 something.
[02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:12.340]  $119.
[02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:16.340]  And listen, why do you think it says Info Wars on it?
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:28.340]  Because the way contracts and rules work, it's a loophole where I can get in the contracts lower prices and sell it for a lower price than anybody else can give a private label it.
[02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:32.340]  And I tell you, these other companies haven't figured this out yet or I don't know what their problems are.
[02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:33.340]  They're just such big corporations.
[02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:34.340]  I don't know.
[02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:36.340]  I don't know, but I'm a free marketer.
[02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:37.340]  That's what I do.
[02:38:37.340 --> 02:38:40.340]  Being informed makes you successful people.
[02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:46.340]  Even if you were a sociopath, you should want to know what's going on in the world.
[02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:57.340]  So this is a game changer and there is some profit in it for us as well to fund the reporters, the operation, the servers, the equipment, the rent, all the expenses here.
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:59.340]  This is a game changer.
[02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:01.340]  Let me go over some of the data on it.
[02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:06.340]  Info Wars premium power pack charges all your electronic devices, has the power to jumpstart almost any vehicle.
[02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:07.340]  And it's tiny folks.
[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:11.340]  For your radio listeners, it's like a third of a suitcase.
[02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:15.340]  The power and jumpstart almost any vehicle with included jumper cables.
[02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:17.340]  Keeping your bug out bag.
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:19.340]  I mean, I'm putting this in both my cars, my truck and my car.
[02:39:19.340 --> 02:39:25.340]  Others charge $150 and that's conservative or more than that for packs with lesser specifications.
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:30.340]  We bring you the Info Wars premium power pack for only $119.
[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:31.340]  And yeah, that's the thing.
[02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:34.340]  Ones that aren't even as good cost more.
[02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:37.340]  Hurry and get yours while supplies last.
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:38.340]  So there you have it.
[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:43.340]  And for one day only, only today, we're going to have another special in a few weeks.
[02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:46.340]  It's going to be a lot off, but nothing like this.
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:49.340]  You can get a one year membership for $19.95.
[02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:52.340]  That's the cost of less than four months normally.
[02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:53.340]  It's $5.95 a month.
[02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:56.340]  $19.95 for one year.
[02:39:56.340 --> 02:40:02.340]  PrisonPlanet.tv to see the news, all my films, ebooks, so much more to support a true independent open platform.
[02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:04.340]  One day only.
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:06.340]  One day only.
[02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:11.340]  We've never offered this in 14, 15 years of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:14.340]  One day only for one year.
[02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.340]  $19.95.
[02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:19.340]  20 people can use each membership.
[02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:24.340]  In 15 years of existence of PrisonPlanet.tv, it's been a little quirky and stuff.
[02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:26.340]  The first few years got better and better.
[02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:27.340]  Now it's first class.
[02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:30.340]  Really a great platform.
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:34.340]  And I want to thank all of you that were members before supporting us, but now is the time.
[02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:35.340]  $19.95.
[02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:43.340]  And then you can give 15, 20 members of your family the username and say, here's your video subscription service thing.
[02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:44.340]  And you know what?
[02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:46.340]  You give it to 15 people, maybe five of them use it.
[02:40:46.340 --> 02:40:50.340]  However, it's five people you help wake up, maybe all of them use it.
[02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:56.340]  But as bandwidth has gotten cheaper over the years, PrisonPlanet.tv has gotten cheaper and it's gotten to work as used to.
[02:40:56.340 --> 02:41:01.340]  I pretty much lost money at first because bandwidth was so expensive, but I had to have my own platform.
[02:41:01.340 --> 02:41:04.340]  Now it just helps pay for cameras and some of the crew, the membership.
[02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:07.340]  So it's essential you become PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:13.340]  And you know, maybe you want to pay the $54.95 that it normally is and not the $19.95.
[02:41:13.340 --> 02:41:18.340]  Wait until tomorrow you can pay $54 or whatever it is.
[02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:20.340]  And that's great.
[02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:23.340]  In fact, please wait until tomorrow if you'd like to support us and support the InfoWare.
[02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:27.340]  But I want you to get something great to wake people up and get the lowest price ever offered.
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:30.340]  Take advantage of it today, but get your friends and family to watch.
[02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:31.340]  That's what it's all about.
[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:32.340]  That's the power.
[02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:33.340]  You have the power.
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:36.340]  You carry the ball.
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:38.340]  This is a death battle, folks.
[02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:44.340]  I think I'm so wound up and cranked up and, you know, bouncing off the walls out here.
[02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:46.340]  This is on one cup of coffee today.
[02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:48.340]  I had a half a cup this morning.
[02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:50.340]  Didn't even drink half a cup of this.
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:51.340]  I'm kind of being bad.
[02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:54.340]  I just opened the Neuromati, but I'm not going to drink more than about half of it.
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:55.340]  This is not caffeine.
[02:41:55.340 --> 02:42:05.340]  I'm bouncing off the walls because at a cellular instinctive genetic level, I'm wound up because there's never been more dangerous times for thermal nuclear war.
[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:07.340]  There's never been more dangerous times for our sovereignty.
[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:17.340]  There's never been open world government conferences with open planetary rule and a global court to arrest you for free speech denying global warming.
[02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:19.340]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:22.340]  This isn't me telling you they're going to do this 10 years ago.
[02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:25.340]  It's here.
[02:42:25.340 --> 02:42:26.340]  So I get wound up.
[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:30.340]  I mean, I am in a fighting mood.
[02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:31.340]  I can't help it.
[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:34.340]  You know, some big guy comes up to me on the street, weighs 100 pounds more than me.
[02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:38.340]  It's like they could, you know, bend jail bars, start threatening me.
[02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:39.340]  I can't help it.
[02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:40.340]  I just start getting in their face.
[02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:45.340]  I'm ready to fight.
[02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:47.340]  And I mean, I'm totally threatened.
[02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:56.340]  I mean, I just, I'm awake and I'm watching the craziest mind control mass Stockholm syndrome I've ever seen.
[02:42:56.340 --> 02:43:03.340]  I'm watching our country totally dismantled by design by people that hate us.
[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:13.340]  And I just realized, my God, can't we wake up out of the trance?
[02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:15.340]  Or was our spirit taken?
[02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:18.340]  Is America meant to fall?
[02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:19.340]  Is everything meant to fall?
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:21.340]  I guess we killed 55 million babies.
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:22.340]  I guess we sell baby parts.
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:24.340]  I guess we don't take care of our old people.
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:30.340]  I guess we put veterans on don't treat list, but stand up and salute at the football game to feel good about ourselves.
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:37.340]  But you know what, I know a large portion of us do care, are moral, are hardworking.
[02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:38.340]  We're not perfect.
[02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:43.340]  We certainly have consciences and knock ourselves all day, but I'll assure you those people that don't have a conscience,
[02:43:43.340 --> 02:43:49.340]  those sociopaths, psychopaths, control freaks, sadists, scumbags, they like screwing us over.
[02:43:49.340 --> 02:43:52.340]  They think it makes them better than us because they know we're better than them.
[02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:54.340]  And I'm sick of these people.
[02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:56.340]  I know I'm stronger.
[02:43:56.340 --> 02:43:58.340]  I know I've got more will than they do.
[02:43:58.340 --> 02:44:00.340]  I'll tear them apart and they know it.
[02:44:00.340 --> 02:44:04.340]  That's why they're scared of us and they know we're rising.
[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:07.340]  They know we're waking up.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:09.340]  I want to beat these people.
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:11.340]  I hate them.
[02:44:11.340 --> 02:44:13.340]  These are scum.
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:18.340]  They want to dumb us down, get us on our knees and have their way with us when they think nothing can stop them.
[02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:24.340]  Well, if they want to take us down, they're going to get a fight.
[02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:28.340]  They have jacked with people's brains so bad it's sick.
[02:44:28.340 --> 02:44:33.340]  And I can't believe all the scum they've gotten to work for this corrupt system and the corporations, governments,
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:34.340]  but I'll tell you how they do it.
[02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:36.340]  They're compartmentalized too.
[02:44:36.340 --> 02:44:39.340]  And that's why this broadcast is so dangerous.
[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:41.340]  It's because it's real.
[02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:45.340]  And it speaks directly to people's DNA and they know it.
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:47.340]  Everybody knows we're dying.
[02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:49.340]  Everybody knows we're in trouble.
[02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:52.340]  Everybody knows we got a devil on our back.
[02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:57.340]  Everybody knows things are getting worse and they know where this tunnel leads is really bad.
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:00.340]  And I'm here to tell you it's time to turn around, folks.
[02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:02.340]  It's time to get out of here.
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:08.340]  I don't know what's going to happen when we try to get out of here and it probably isn't going to be as sweet as we want it to be.
[02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:16.340]  But you know what? It's better to die on our feet than on our knees sucking people's boots.
[02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:22.340]  You know what you could do with banner hangs, what you could do spreading the word about this show or others,
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:25.340]  what you could do about aggressively going in bullhorning or going to city council,
[02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:29.340]  or calling in to talk radio or putting out flyers in your neighborhood,
[02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:34.340]  the stunts you could pull, the things you could do.
[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:38.340]  I've got to pull some stunts, legal and lawful stunts, soon.
[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:40.340]  Just to show everybody what you can do.
[02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:45.340]  And we do little things, but it's not about what we do saving the world or making things completely better.
[02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:47.340]  It's about the action showing others.
[02:45:47.340 --> 02:45:49.340]  We probably got 15 or so.
[02:45:49.340 --> 02:45:52.340]  Jacobson was telling me more than 15 probably.
[02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:55.340]  Entries. And some of them aren't that good. Some of them are great.
[02:45:55.340 --> 02:46:03.340]  But you know what? Everyone that makes a Hillary, you know, laugh at Hillary contest that we'll be announcing at the first of the year,
[02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:07.340]  is a winner because you tried. You took action. It's like the widows might.
[02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:12.340]  You had so little, you gave. You tried. You got up on your feet.
[02:46:12.340 --> 02:46:15.340]  The only good ones, you know, we're posting. The decent ones were posting.
[02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:17.340]  And the okay ones were posting.
[02:46:17.340 --> 02:46:20.340]  And I don't want to hear anybody in the comments. I know the trolls will do it,
[02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:26.340]  but I don't want to hear anybody in the comments, you know, shoot their mouths off about people like that because they did something.
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:30.340]  And I'll tell you, that's why trolls sit there and complain about people taking action because they hate it,
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:32.340]  because they've already given up. They're dead already.
[02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:36.340]  And thank God we're not those people.
[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:41.340]  My first access shows 21 years ago in two months.
[02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:45.340]  I went into the control room. I had nobody to help me. I'd taken a three day class.
[02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:50.340]  I turned on lights glaring in my face with a camera on me in the control room.
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:57.340]  The clock ticked down. There I was.
[02:46:57.340 --> 02:47:01.340]  Back when Access TV had huge viewerships in Austin, Texas.
[02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:04.340]  The most boring stuff was on basic cable. Most of the city had it.
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:07.340]  And within a month, my show was in the newspaper.
[02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:12.340]  Within six months, I was out with a $100 video camera showing government hypocrisy,
[02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:25.340]  giving old veterans $2,000 a fine for three inch grass that the city council people had three foot grass.
[02:47:25.340 --> 02:47:28.340]  And it changed. It changed the law. It changed everything. Just that little thing.
[02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:31.340]  And I was nobody, but I knew what was wrong.
[02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:41.340]  And by the way, I showed this old veteran rolling down Langston, then try to take their house realtors involved wanting to get it.
[02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:49.340]  And then an Austin cop called up to the Access TV hotline and said, here's the address of Jackie Goodman.
[02:47:49.340 --> 02:47:55.340]  She's got three foot grass and her house is only a few miles away from that neighborhood.
[02:47:55.340 --> 02:48:00.340]  And I went over there and shot video of it.
[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:03.340]  And then she came out and apologized. And so what was happening was wrong.
[02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:08.340]  Even though he'd been to the city council and they'd had the corrupt pet cops, they kept down there at the time,
[02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:12.340]  rough him up and throw him out.
[02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:15.340]  But see, it's all about good people versus bad people.
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:18.340]  Oh, you roughed up the old man, didn't you?
[02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:22.340]  But see, then the good cop knew what happened and made sure the hypocrisy got exposed.
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:25.340]  And that's the difference between good people and bad people.
[02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:31.340]  And the only reason the bad people are winning is because good men and women do nothing.
[02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:36.340]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good humans do nothing.
[02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:46.340]  Thomas Jefferson, politically correct, I said good men.
[02:48:46.340 --> 02:48:50.340]  It's fundamentally painful for me to go into bondage.
[02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:53.340]  It's fundamentally painful to be a slave.
[02:48:53.340 --> 02:49:04.340]  It's fundamentally painful because even if I'm free of heart, as the tyranny goes into place, I am becoming a slave.
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:08.340]  The poisons in the food and water are unavoidable at this point.
[02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:12.340]  You can try to avoid them and mitigate it, but we are under attack.
[02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:17.340]  And I've got white papers and thousand page books just lining my office.
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:23.340]  I've made films, I've showed you where they just, you know, Ted Turner writes books and Prince Philip writes books
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:29.340]  and Brzezinski writes books and Kissinger writes books and John P. Holdren writes books.
[02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:33.340]  And how can we put the fluoride in the water to sterilize and hurt you?
[02:49:33.340 --> 02:49:34.340]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:49:34.340 --> 02:49:39.340]  I mean, they write books and look what they've done to us.
[02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:41.340]  Look at how stupid people are.
[02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:46.340]  But let me tell you, you can be drunk stumbling around as soon as somebody attacks you.
[02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:48.340]  You wake up a lot, don't you?
[02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:54.340]  And even though we're stunned and hurt, if people get the fact they're under attack, they ever shake their mind for a minute
[02:49:54.340 --> 02:50:00.340]  and just look around them and click to what's going on and realize it's the globalist on top.
[02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:01.340]  They're the enemy.
[02:50:01.340 --> 02:50:03.340]  They're directing the whole show.
[02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:09.340]  And you realize that they're from an evil team with an evil vision and an evil game plan.
[02:50:09.340 --> 02:50:11.340]  And we know their game plan.
[02:50:11.340 --> 02:50:16.340]  And the minute people start finding out how exciting it is to learn about how the world really works
[02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:21.340]  and learn about the players, instead of knowing about sitcoms and sports heroes,
[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:24.340]  you know about real heroes, you know about real enemies.
[02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:26.340]  Then you realize you're living in a movie.
[02:50:26.340 --> 02:50:30.340]  You're living in a science fiction movie on a planet in deep space.
[02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:35.340]  With the whole future of humanity laid out before us, unlimited life extension.
[02:50:35.340 --> 02:50:38.340]  Not for our children, for us.
[02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:42.340]  Advanced technology, space travel, interdimensional.
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:43.340]  It's all ours.
[02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:46.340]  The eye is not seen here, not heard, but God has a store with us.
[02:50:46.340 --> 02:50:52.340]  But first, we have to get past the devil who stands at the gate to Valhalla.
[02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:55.340]  Get behind me, Satan, out of the way.
[02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:58.340]  Humanity's coming through.
[02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:01.340]  My name is Bill Wanner, and I have an important message.
[02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:07.340]  Right now, the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis.
[02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:09.340]  But they're about to lose control.
[02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:14.340]  When this happens, it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined.
[02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:19.340]  From where we shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[02:51:19.340 --> 02:51:21.340]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:25.340]  A few years ago, I warned that the housing prices would collapse.
[02:51:25.340 --> 02:51:30.340]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash, and they did.
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:33.340]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:36.340]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:51:36.340 --> 02:51:38.340]  This will affect us all.
[02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:42.340]  I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com.
[02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:49.340]  Maybe you'll disagree with my conclusions, but first, you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself.
[02:51:49.340 --> 02:51:55.340]  You can watch the video for free right now by going to dollardanger.com.
[02:51:55.340 --> 02:52:17.340]  Again, that's dollardanger.com.
[02:52:26.340 --> 02:52:28.340]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:32.340]  This holiday season, give your loved ones the gift of preparedness.
[02:52:32.340 --> 02:52:36.340]  Food Insurance, America's most trusted provider of freeze-dried emergency food,

[02:52:58.340 --> 02:53:04.340]  The lining of your lungs is supposed to be protected with glutathione, to neutralizing coming irritants.
[02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:08.340]  In the absence of enough glutathione, your lungs are more prone to irritation.
[02:53:08.340 --> 02:53:13.340]  Listen to the real-world results of one man using a powerful glutathione supporting food.
[02:53:13.340 --> 02:53:15.340]  Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien.
[02:53:15.340 --> 02:53:18.340]  I generally suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation.
[02:53:18.340 --> 02:53:21.340]  My breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs.
[02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:27.340]  After consuming One World Way today, I have tremendous energy and also notice my breathing is free.
[02:53:27.340 --> 02:53:31.340]  I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen,
[02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:34.340]  which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling.
[02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:37.340]  Being a singer, I love feeling this unrestricted voice.
[02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:52.340]  The real life actually added to my routine is One World Way. Wow.
[02:54:07.340 --> 02:54:14.340]  Waging war on corruption, crashing with a lie and disinformation.
[02:54:14.340 --> 02:54:19.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:30.340]  We can break the enemy, but first we have to know there is an enemy.
[02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:36.340]  We have to know that God of the Universe stands with us.
[02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:41.340]  If we decide to take action and take the field,
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:52.340]  but you must first make the conscious decision to set your will against the globalists,
[02:54:52.340 --> 02:54:59.340]  then only will Providence begin to shine.
[02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:01.340]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:13.340]  In the fourth hour, Paul Joseph Watson today from London breaks down the Global Government Conference.
[02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:17.340]  Prosecutors ban Soros Foundation as threat to Russian national security.
[02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:20.340]  That's being reported across the world from Reuters.
[02:55:20.340 --> 02:55:25.340]  The group admittedly has overthrown Ukraine and installed a right-wing fascist government
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:30.340]  that openly held Hitler, but that's okay because Soros is Jewish and was a Nazi collaborator.
[02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:32.340]  For real, Nazi, it's totally fine.
[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:38.340]  You actually fight against that stuff and the ADL calls you a Nazi with a slimy grip of filth.
[02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:47.340]  Russian-Syrian army planned to block the Turkish border in Operation Total Destruction.
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:49.340]  Not a very politically correct name.
[02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:54.340]  We'll use warships, aircraft, and submarines against the West Islamic State.
[02:55:54.340 --> 02:56:00.340]  A little baby caliphates their setting up that the government will not protect us from, of course.
[02:56:00.340 --> 02:56:03.340]  Turkey blocks Russian shipping, Black Sea Fleet.
[02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:04.340]  This is hardly even in the news.
[02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:07.340]  It's just huge over the top escalations.
[02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:14.340]  University of Missouri teaching assistant beats teenage relative for not wearing a hood over their head.
[02:56:14.340 --> 02:56:19.340]  Graham urges U.S. to press ahead with ground trips in Syria and, of course, back al-Qaeda.
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:22.340]  Just two years ago, he was there with McCain meeting with the terrorist.
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:27.340]  U.K. faces millions more migrants as Turkey and its 75 million people on the brink of joining EU.
[02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:32.340]  They'll be open free border with Turkey, letting all the Islamist radicals in.
[02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:34.340]  Again, I mentioned this, I thought I'd read it again.
[02:56:34.340 --> 02:56:39.340]  Swedish woman raped by refugee, refuses to report it because she feels sorry for him.
[02:56:39.340 --> 02:56:41.340]  Infowars.com.
[02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:47.340]  Italians outraged after headmaster scraps Christmas carol concerts not to offend Muslims.
[02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:50.340]  Saudi Arabia refuses to take even a single refugee.
[02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:53.340]  Well, that's okay because they're not white, so they can't do anything wrong.
[02:56:53.340 --> 02:56:56.340]  Mareela, they just started the whole war and ran the whole thing, but it's not their fault.
[02:56:56.340 --> 02:57:00.340]  They just have pleasure palaces with kidnapped American women and slave dodgers, but it's not right.
[02:57:00.340 --> 02:57:02.340]  I don't think it's liberal.
[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:03.340]  I mean, the lawyer's kind of likes it.
[02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:06.340]  Mareela Pinn and front national surge in French regional elections.
[02:57:06.340 --> 02:57:07.340]  They just arrested her.
[02:57:07.340 --> 02:57:08.340]  That's just in French free.
[02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:09.340]  It's liberal.
[02:57:09.340 --> 02:57:10.340]  It's all liberal.
[02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:14.340]  In fact, I want to play a speech of her part of it coming up in the next segment.
[02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:16.340]  I'm going to do five more minutes before Watson comes in.
[02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:18.340]  French national front poised to win regional vote.
[02:57:18.340 --> 02:57:20.340]  We just arrest them.
[02:57:20.340 --> 02:57:23.340]  Leader of Germany, anti-immigrant party calls on Merkel to resign.
[02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:27.340]  Mass brawls erupt in crowded shelters in Germany.
[02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:31.340]  14,000 illegal immigrants, Sweden disappear without a trace.
[02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:34.340]  Saudi Arabia is arresting people for poetry, death penalty.
[02:57:34.340 --> 02:57:36.340]  That's just some of the news I have on that front.
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:38.340]  And then, of course, I mentioned the climate stuff.
[02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:40.340]  Let me just go back over some more of that.
[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:41.340]  I haven't covered all that yet.
[02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:45.340]  Trade expert, Trans-Pacific Partnership vehicle to pass Obama climate change treaty.
[02:57:45.340 --> 02:57:47.340]  I stealth, of course, but they're saving the earth.
[02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:48.340]  So it's okay.
[02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:49.340]  Just pay them trillions.
[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:51.340]  It's pretty good global government.
[02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:54.340]  We're at the political class at the top and these robber barons get paid money when you
[02:57:54.340 --> 02:58:00.340]  literally eat a piece of meat or gas your car up or turn a light on or buy a table.
[02:58:00.340 --> 02:58:04.340]  Just everything has taxes directly to them above the law with diplomatic immunity.
[02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:06.340]  Just total lawless evil.
[02:58:06.340 --> 02:58:09.340]  The return of the kings, squatting on everyone.
[02:58:09.340 --> 02:58:13.340]  In giant jumbo jets with red carpets and just hundreds of top prostitutes all over them,
[02:58:13.340 --> 02:58:18.340]  laughing at everyone, gobbling caviar and stomping around about how great communism is.
[02:58:18.340 --> 02:58:20.340]  Oh, they gang rape everyone.
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:24.340]  And just overrun and have their ISIS people blowing up every historical site they can.
[02:58:24.340 --> 02:58:28.340]  Just vandalizing the genetic code of the planet, just foaming at the mouth,
[02:58:28.340 --> 02:58:30.340]  deadly vaccines injecting everyone.
[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:32.340]  Just total psychotic demons above the law.
[02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:34.340]  How far does it go?
[02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:36.340]  How far will you let it go?

[03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:14.340]  Final segment, then I hand the baton to his Britannic Majesty, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:18.340]  He actually hates the Royal House. It's a joke.
[03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:22.340]  Capital royalty! That's coming up.
[03:00:22.340 --> 03:00:28.340]  But let's go to Marie Le Pen, whose father was the big famous nationalist.
[03:00:28.340 --> 03:00:32.340]  And, I mean, it's pretty just mainline, milk toast, conservative libertarianism.
[03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:37.340]  We shouldn't take in 2 million radicals in a year. We shouldn't be totally socialist.
[03:00:37.340 --> 03:00:44.340]  We shouldn't have 101% tax rates on millionaires when the Socialist Party is tax-exempt and don't pay taxes.
[03:00:44.340 --> 03:00:47.340]  I mean, how long did all of them have been caught sarcosis?
[03:00:47.340 --> 03:00:49.340]  They shouldn't even pay taxes.
[03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:56.340]  It's like Hillary takes money from dictators and then, you know, arrests Anastasia Sousa for a crooked toenail.
[03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:58.340]  This is the lawlessness of the scum.
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:01:06.340]  The arrogant action in our face dominating us, breaking our will, setting the precedent that they can do, you know what, on us and rub it in.
[03:01:06.340 --> 03:01:13.340]  So here's her powerful speech to the EU Parliament, and I will narrate over this, but let's start rolling.
[03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:18.340]  La France a traversé une épreuve absolument épouvantable.
[03:01:18.340 --> 03:01:20.340]  An absolutely horrendous ordeal Friday the 13th.
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:26.340]  I think the first respect we have to pay to the victims is to name what has...
[03:01:26.340 --> 03:01:39.340] ...assassinated them, but neither from our French leadership nor in all of these speeches, which I heard this morning, I have heard the name of the assassin.
[03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:47.340]  The assassin is not the terrorism, terrorism is the weapon that is in the hand of the assassin.
[03:01:47.340 --> 03:01:54.340]  The murder is the ideology in the name of which terrorism does the killing.
[03:01:54.340 --> 03:02:12.340]  It is Islamists' fundamentalism, and you must say it, because if you don't say it, if you are unable to name the enemy, then obviously you cannot fight it.
[03:02:12.340 --> 03:02:20.340]  But perhaps some of you are embarrassed to name it, because naming it forces one to question certain international friendships.
[03:02:20.340 --> 03:02:29.340]  It forces one to task oneself the question of whether one can continue to have Saudi Arabia as an ally or Qatar.
[03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:37.340]  It forces one to ask oneself about the ambiguity of Turkey regarding Islamists' fundamentalism.
[03:02:37.340 --> 03:02:58.340]  It obliges one to face up and to say that yes, the majority of international agreements of international alliances we passed push us in reality to be today objectively the allies of Islamists' fundamentalism rather than its enemies.
[03:02:58.340 --> 03:03:10.340]  So I propose that we change our alliances, and I suggest that all those who fight against Islamists' fundamentalism must be considered as allies without any reservations.
[03:03:10.340 --> 03:03:31.340]  I'm talking about Russia, including, of course, Muslim countries that fight against Islamists' fundamentalism, such as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, evidently Russia and Iran, boy, she knows her stuff.
[03:03:31.340 --> 03:03:40.340]  I want to say also that one of the reasons for the alienation of France is Europe's imbeciles, which today is the obstacle, the return of security of the French people.
[03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:52.340]  First among the imbecile policies is the question of mass immigration, which is old, and which is the terrain of sectarianism and the answer.
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:56.340]  But why are the terrorists, and who are they born?
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:04:13.340]  Why are they in soil? It is because of this. It's because mass immigration has brought about sectarianism, and that communitarianism, sectarianism is the terrain on which Islamists' fundamentalism recruits, which is a socialist plan, by the way,
[03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:21.340]  that further soldiers, the EU announced, that 3 million migrants will arrive in Europe next year alone.
[03:04:21.340 --> 03:04:29.340]  Because we do not equate all migrants with terrorists, of course not, however.
[03:04:29.340 --> 03:04:34.340]  What I denounced in September is the parliament, the infiltration of jihadists, and then it goes over.
[03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:45.340]  She was arrested for giving a similar speech a month ago, and is facing a year in prison, and huge fines for saying what she just said again this time to the EU parliament.
[03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:55.340]  The right crime is, of course, the attack on free speech. This is how sickening the social engineers are, and they hate the virtue and wealth of the West, and are hell bent on destroying it.
[03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:58.340]  All Watson's coming up!
[03:04:58.340 --> 03:05:06.340]  Man-made climate change is largely a myth promoted by politicians to scare the public into accepting a vast expansion of government to supposedly stop global warming.
[03:05:06.340 --> 03:05:11.340]  Global warming is a manufactured problem played out by the government to instigate a public reaction, in this case fear.
[03:05:11.340 --> 03:05:22.340]  The government then exploits to offer a predetermined solution. The strategy, now known as the Hegelian dialectic, has been used successfully by politicians for millennia to expand government which can only grow at the expense of individual liberties.
[03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:28.340]  The Bush administration used this strategy successfully in 2003, when it gained enough public support for the invasion of Iraq.
[03:05:28.340 --> 03:05:35.340]  A claiming country had weapons of mass destruction, and the war ultimately expanded the military-industrial complex in America's emerging police state.
[03:05:35.340 --> 03:05:45.340]  Today, global warming is used as a bogeyman because it allows the UN to use government-funded scientists to scare the public into believing that man-made climate change is too big of a threat for their country to handle alone.
[03:05:45.340 --> 03:05:50.340]  And thus, it can only be defeated through the expansion of the UN at the expense of their nation's sovereignty.
[03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:55.340]  The number one goal of an out-of-control government is not to protect you, but rather to gain more power at your expense.
[03:05:55.340 --> 03:06:05.340]  This is Kid Angles with InfoWars.com.

[03:08:32.340 --> 03:08:40.340]  First, we're going to talk about probably one of the most ludicrous speeches that President Barack Obama has ever given.
[03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:47.340]  Of course, he's up in front of the UN Climate Conference in Paris. Here's an article out of CNN.
[03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:56.340]  There have been reports about Obama over the past few months, you know, whispers in the background that he's having some kind of mental breakdown.
[03:08:56.340 --> 03:09:00.340]  That's the only thing that can explain what he said in this speech.
[03:09:00.340 --> 03:09:03.340]  Call in. Let me know what you think about it. This is out of CNN.
[03:09:03.340 --> 03:09:09.340]  Obama, climate summit, a rejection of terror.
[03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:18.340]  Combatting climate change will prove to be a rebuttal of terrorist efforts President Barack Obama declared at the opening of a major climate summit in Paris.
[03:09:18.340 --> 03:09:30.340]  Because ISIS jihadists who are busy chopping people's heads off are really going to be quaking in their boots at the fact that Barack Obama is waffling on about global warming in Paris.
[03:09:30.340 --> 03:09:42.340]  It's a stunning rebuke to the jihadists. The CNN article continues, quote, what greater rejection of those who would tear down our world than marshalling our best efforts to save it.
[03:09:42.340 --> 03:09:52.340]  Obama said Monday at the COP 21 conference being held at a highly secured site outside the French capital two weeks after ISIS terrorists carried out a bloody rampage.
[03:09:52.340 --> 03:10:02.340]  Now let's get it straight. He's not saying it's a rebuke. It's a rejection of terror because they've just had the gall, the guts to show up two weeks after this terror attack.
[03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:10.340]  He's actually saying it's a rebuke in the sense that they'll be upset that Obama's talking about global warming.
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:18.340]  I mean, how does that make sense in any way possible? Obama thinks he's going to defeat ISIS by talking about global warming.
[03:10:18.340 --> 03:10:28.340]  I don't get that. I understand that. I don't get the connection. In fact, there's a tweet which spiked.com. Just pay out on Twitter.
[03:10:28.340 --> 03:10:38.340]  It says the link between ISIS and climate change, the proponents of both expressed contempt for modernity and long to revert to a backward way of life.
[03:10:38.340 --> 03:10:51.340]  So if you want a link between the proponents of this climate change BS and ISIS, that's the only link that anyone can think of because there certainly isn't one otherwise that makes any kind of sense.
[03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:57.340]  So Obama's up there basically saying that the climate summit is a stunning rejection of terror.
[03:10:57.340 --> 03:11:09.340]  And of course, for sure, the ISIS jihadists as a result will be just abandoning their ideology in droves. That's guaranteed, right? Because Obama's waffling on about global warming.
[03:11:09.340 --> 03:11:22.340]  And again, this is really ironic because of course, while saying that talking about global warming is going to combat ISIS, in the name of global warming and protecting the environment,
[03:11:22.340 --> 03:11:31.340]  Obama and the White House have actually been protecting ISIS because we had this report, which we mentioned last week. This is out of Newsweek.
[03:11:31.340 --> 03:11:40.340]  Ex-CIA chief Obama refused strikes on ISIS oil wells, fearing environmental damage. Let's go to this clip.
[03:11:40.340 --> 03:11:48.340]  This is one of the collateral damage questions, right? So prior to Paris, there seemed to be a judgment, right?
[03:11:48.340 --> 03:12:05.340]  I don't sit in this room anymore, but there seems to have been a judgment that, look, we don't want to destroy these oil tankers because that's infrastructure that's going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn't there anymore.
[03:12:05.340 --> 03:12:17.340]  And it's going to create environmental damage. And we didn't go after oil wells, actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls because we didn't want to do environmental damage and we didn't want to destroy that infrastructure, right?
[03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:19.340]  So we hit oil on trucks.
[03:12:19.340 --> 03:12:29.340]  So now we're hitting oil on trucks, right? And maybe you get to the point where you say we have to also hit oil wells. So those are the kind of tough decisions you have to make.
[03:12:29.340 --> 03:12:48.340]  That's former CIA director Mike Morel on Charlie Rose saying that the reason why the Obama administration wouldn't bomb ISIS and destroy ISIS's oil wells was out of concern for environmental damage. For 15 months, they failed to target ISIS oil wells for, quote, environmental concerns.
[03:12:48.340 --> 03:13:04.340]  Of course, we know that's not the real reason. The real reason they're so upset about Russia actually obliterating ISIS's oil wells and their oil tankers is because they wanted ISIS in the region to isolate Bashar al-Assad as the Pentagon's own document stated.
[03:13:04.340 --> 03:13:18.340]  So it's ironic that now Obama is up in front of the UN in Paris saying that ISIS is going to be really upset over the fact that he's talking about global warming. Again, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
[03:13:18.340 --> 03:13:29.340]  He's prepared to make those kind of ludicrous statements while still failing completely. He doesn't dare say the word Islamic when it comes to Islamic terrorism and the Islamic State.
[03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:36.340]  Yeah, he's now up there saying this in front of the UN. There's another article on that actually from Michael Snyder, wishesuponinfowars.com.
[03:13:36.340 --> 03:13:48.340]  The bizarre explanation for why the U.S. has avoided bombing ISIS oil wells. And again, they waited 15 months to do so while Russia took out a thousand within just five days.
[03:13:48.340 --> 03:14:01.340]  So again, there's a whole bunch of different reasons for that. But this whole Paris climate summit itself, I mean, I've made a video which went up a few hours ago, wishesuponinfowars.com, which I invite you to check out and share.
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:14.340]  It's called, global warming is a crock of crap. That's a different word, but I can't say it on air. But that's proving to be quite a controversial video even in the first few hours of its release.
[03:14:14.340 --> 03:14:32.340]  Because it drills down into the facts of how the same people now pushing global warming have been spectacularly wrong and inaccurate in their predictions, not just about global warming, but before that in the 70s about global cooling.
[03:14:32.340 --> 03:14:40.340]  So they've been completely discredited, debunked, spectacularly inaccurate. So why should we believe them now?
[03:14:40.340 --> 03:14:45.340]  In fact, there's an article out of The New American, which really boils this down well.
[03:14:45.340 --> 03:14:51.340]  Embarrassing predictions haunt the global warming industry. And this is what I go through in my video.
[03:14:51.340 --> 03:15:01.340]  It's a set of examples of how they've made these predictions about manmade climate change, which again have proven to be completely inaccurate and wrong.
[03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:11.340]  And yet we're still supposed to trust these people when it comes to global warming, when it comes to carbon taxes in Paris right now.
[03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:16.340]  So the article says global cooling. Of course, this was the big scare in the 70s.
[03:15:16.340 --> 03:15:29.340]  Americans who lived through the 1960s and 70s may remember the dire global cooling predictions that were hyped and given great credibility by Newsweek, Time, Life, National Geographic and numerous other mainstream media outlets.
[03:15:29.340 --> 03:15:40.340]  According to the manmade global cooling theories of the time, billions of people should be dead by now owing to cooling linked crop failures and starvation.
[03:15:40.340 --> 03:15:49.340]  Now this was a quote by one of these scientists who was of course given full credibility by the mainstream media about manmade climate change.
[03:15:49.340 --> 03:16:01.340]  Quote, if present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but 11 degrees colder by the year 2000.
[03:16:01.340 --> 03:16:08.340]  That was ecology professor Kenneth E. F. Watt at the University of California in 1970.
[03:16:08.340 --> 03:16:22.340]  So this was, you know, Time Magazine, Life, National Geographic, all of them giving a platform to these discredited scientists who were talking about the earth being 11 degrees colder by the year 2000.
[03:16:22.340 --> 03:16:29.340]  Then we had Paul Ehrlich, of course, the author of The Population Bomb, another global cooling alarmist.
[03:16:29.340 --> 03:16:40.340]  He wrote in his 1968 book, quote, by the year 2000, the United Kingdom will simply be a small group of impoverished islands inhabited by some 70 million hungry people.
[03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:51.340]  If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist by the year 2000 and give 10 to one that the life of the average Britain will be of distinctly lower quality than it is today.
[03:16:51.340 --> 03:17:00.340]  So he's predicting, again, back in the 70s, that England wouldn't exist by the year 2000 because of global cooling.
[03:17:00.340 --> 03:17:07.340]  Well, I'm sat here just outside London, England right now, and I can attest to the fact that everything's hunky-dory.
[03:17:07.340 --> 03:17:15.340]  In fact, the rest of these alarmists said that England would be a series of small islands because it would be overwhelmed by sea levels.
[03:17:15.340 --> 03:17:21.340]  Again, completely debunked, completely inaccurate. But listen to this.
[03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:31.340]  To combat the alleged man-made cooling, experts suggested all sorts of grandiose schemes, including some that in retrospect appear almost too comical to be real.
[03:17:31.340 --> 03:17:42.340]  Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climate change or to allay its effects.
[03:17:42.340 --> 03:17:51.340]  And so their solution was to, quote, melt the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black salt or diverting Arctic rivers.
[03:17:51.340 --> 03:18:01.340]  So they actually said that because the Earth was cooling, because there was going to be a new ice age, we had to cover the polar ice caps in salt to make them melt.
[03:18:01.340 --> 03:18:08.340]  Again, completely ludicrous, completely debunked. But this was what they were saying back in the 1970s.
[03:18:08.340 --> 03:18:13.340]  Let's move forward to today. This is out of Bloomberg Business Week.
[03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:24.340]  How to slow climate change with a fake volcano? There's a cheap, quick, dirty and controversial way to combat global warming that isn't on the agenda of the UN climate summit in Paris.
[03:18:24.340 --> 03:18:29.340]  It involves replicating the planet-cooling effect of a volcanic eruption.
[03:18:29.340 --> 03:18:45.340]  Of course, they're talking about using modified jets to inject fine droplets of sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, where they would combine with water vapors to form fine sulfate particles that reflect sunlight away from the Earth.
[03:18:45.340 --> 03:18:50.340]  So again, back in the 70s, they were talking about covering the polar ice caps.
[03:18:50.340 --> 03:18:58.340]  Now they're talking about injecting the environment with sulfur, blocking out the sun to prevent global warming.
[03:18:58.340 --> 03:19:11.340]  So the same lunatics that propose these ridiculous draconian off-the-wall geoengineering programs are still in the news today and being given credibility to do the same thing.
[03:19:11.340 --> 03:19:15.340]  And many of them are at this Paris climate summit.
[03:19:15.340 --> 03:19:24.340]  So again, all these predictions from the 70s onwards were proven totally wrong, and yet we're still supposed to afford these people credibility.
[03:19:24.340 --> 03:19:32.340]  The United Nations, sorry for my voice, I've got flu at the moment, so I'm trying to battle through this.
[03:19:32.340 --> 03:19:43.340]  In 2005, the UN warned that imminent sea-level rises increase hurricanes and desertification caused by man-made global warming would cause massive population disruptions.
[03:19:43.340 --> 03:19:58.340]  Listen to what the UN said about climate refugees, and this was only back in 2005. Listen to how alarmingly wrong they were. We'll be back with the next segment after the break, infowars.com. Stay tuned.
[03:20:14.340 --> 03:20:21.340]  But have you considered heat storage? I'm talking about staying warm in the cold. Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:20:21.340 --> 03:20:30.340]  How will I keep my family warm? The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane, but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you.
[03:20:30.340 --> 03:20:38.340]  Another concern? There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war. There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:20:38.340 --> 03:20:49.340]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think. For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com. Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.

[03:24:08.340 --> 03:24:26.340]  We're back at support hour of the Alex Jones show. So basically the UN, which of course is hosting this Paris climate summit, back in 2005 said that there would be, quote, 50 million climate refugees by 2010.
[03:24:26.340 --> 03:24:43.340]  Of course, that woefully inaccurate prediction failed to pass. There weren't any climate refugees. They got it completely wrong. And when they were called out on this, the UN actually tried to delete evidence from their own website that they'd even made the prediction in the first place.
[03:24:43.340 --> 03:25:00.340]  So again, every time they get caught making these false predictions, they go back and try to cover their tracks. But we're told that we have to trust them, but they're the experts. They have the consensus and that we need to pay them carbon taxes and basically ruin our economies,
[03:25:00.340 --> 03:25:11.340]  ruin the economies of the developing world in the name of stopping Man Bear Pig, even though they've been discredited time and time again with these ridiculous predictions that never come true.
[03:25:11.340 --> 03:25:27.340]  Here's another one. In 2003, the Pentagon released a report predicting that within 10 years by 2013, climate change would flood California with inland seas and that parts of the Netherlands would be unlivable.
[03:25:27.340 --> 03:25:35.340]  Of course, neither of those scenarios came to pass over the next 10 years. The report was completely debunked.
[03:25:35.340 --> 03:25:44.340]  But people never go back and pick up on this and say, hang on a minute, why should we trust you, given that you've been caught lying to us over and over again?
[03:25:44.340 --> 03:25:55.340]  Here's another example. And I could go on for hours, but I've just picked out four. In 2000, climate change alarmists in the United Kingdom said that it would cease to snow in Britain.
[03:25:55.340 --> 03:26:05.340]  They said that snowfall would be a thing of the past and that children would grow up not even knowing what snow is. That was in 2000.
[03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:16.340]  And again, they went back and deleted the original articles so nobody could find them. Thankfully, they were cached and turned into PDF files, which you'll see in this video, which is uponinforwars.com.
[03:26:16.340 --> 03:26:26.340]  So in 2000, they said that's it for snow in Britain, global warming. The children are going to grow up not knowing what it is at all. Fast forward nine years.
[03:26:26.340 --> 03:26:38.340]  2009 London has its heaviest snowfall in decades. And then in 2010, the United Kingdom has its coldest winter since records began.
[03:26:38.340 --> 03:26:49.340]  So again, another example where they make one of these apocalyptic predictions, which is proven completely inaccurate, but we've got to trust them once again.
[03:26:49.340 --> 03:27:05.340]  This is the same people who are meeting in Paris right now. And of course, the big example is back in 2007, the BBC and others, Al Gore, said that the Arctic would have ice-free summers by 2013.
[03:27:05.340 --> 03:27:13.340]  They actually came out and said that it's on the record. Again, the BBC article is in this video, which is uponinforwars.com.
[03:27:13.340 --> 03:27:26.340]  So what happened was the Arctic ice-free by the summer of 2013. Well, now by the summer of 2015, Arctic sea ice was the thickest it had been in the past 10 years.
[03:27:26.340 --> 03:27:37.340]  So it wasn't ice-free. It increased. And then you look at the Antarctic. 2014 recorded a record maximum of sea ice.
[03:27:37.340 --> 03:27:47.340]  So again, chicken little, the sky is falling. There are going to be 50 million climate refugees. It's going to stop snowing in the United Kingdom altogether.
[03:27:47.340 --> 03:27:57.340]  The Pentagon said that California would be split with inland seas. The parts of Holland would be unlivable. You know, the polar ice caps are melting.
[03:27:57.340 --> 03:28:05.340]  None of it happened. None of it. And yet we're still supposed to trust these people who are meeting in Paris right now.
[03:28:05.340 --> 03:28:12.340]  And what's the real agenda? It's not to save Mother Earth. It's about power. It's always about power.
[03:28:12.340 --> 03:28:18.340]  And that's what the leaked Copenhagen text revealed. You remember we reported on it back in 2009.
[03:28:18.340 --> 03:28:27.340]  The poorer countries were complaining that they had to take much more of the burden as it pertains to CO2 emissions. And that's the point.
[03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:36.340]  The agenda behind these conferences is to stop developing countries from becoming prosperous and challenging this unipolar world order.
[03:28:36.340 --> 03:28:43.340]  They want to keep the third world as the third world. And they do that by restricting and regulating CO2 emissions.
[03:28:43.340 --> 03:28:55.340]  Because CO2 emissions, which of course are a direct byproduct of capitalism, are directly linked to prosperity, higher GDP and higher quality of life.
[03:28:55.340 --> 03:29:01.340]  So that's why there's this agenda to restrict the developing nations from emitting CO2.
[03:29:01.340 --> 03:29:15.340]  And again, capitalism has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in China, in India, in other countries since the 80s because of development, because of CO2 emissions.
[03:29:15.340 --> 03:29:23.340]  And that's why they want to put the kibosh on it right now. And this is why India is complaining because they're being asked to take the burden for this.
[03:29:23.340 --> 03:29:35.340]  They're calling it carbon imperialism. And that's exactly what it is. It's about power. It's about controlling the prosperity of these nations that might begin to challenge the first world.
[03:29:35.340 --> 03:29:57.340]  When in fact we should be encouraging development across the world for a multipolar world order because that's more free. It produces more prosperity, more choice for everyone.
[03:30:05.340 --> 03:30:11.340]  Right now, only Turkish naval vessels are moving through the Bosporus whereas Russian ships are just sitting nearby waiting to pass.
[03:30:11.340 --> 03:30:16.340]  This is a huge deal that could easily lead to a war because Russia is going to feel threatened if it's boxed in.
[03:30:16.340 --> 03:30:21.340]  For one thing, this prevents Russia's Black Sea fleet from traveling to the rest of the world or even back to its home port.
[03:30:21.340 --> 03:30:34.340]  Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered 150,000 Russian troops deployed into Syria while also sending another 7,000 Russian troops with tanks, rocket launchers and artillery to the Russian-Turkish border with orders to be fully combat ready.
[03:30:34.340 --> 03:30:47.340]  Here's the scary part. Even though Turkey initiated its standoff with Russia by intentionally shooting down a Russian jet near the Syrian border, it can evoke Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which requires all NATO members, including the U.S., to come to its defense if Turkey goes to war with Russia.
[03:30:47.340 --> 03:31:08.340]  If there's going to be another World War, this is precisely how it would start. Keep checking back at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv for more reports. This is Kit Daniels reporting.

[03:35:09.340 --> 03:35:13.340]  We'll leave in Paris. You're on the air. Go ahead. We'll leave.
[03:35:13.340 --> 03:35:17.340]  How are you Paul? I wish you a fast recovery from your flu.
[03:35:17.340 --> 03:35:20.340]  Thanks a lot. What's on your mind today?
[03:35:20.340 --> 03:35:25.340]  So Paul, guess who I bumped into this morning in the bus?
[03:35:25.340 --> 03:35:27.340]  Who is that?
[03:35:27.340 --> 03:35:31.340]  That would be Alex's best friend, Al Gore, taking the bus.
[03:35:31.340 --> 03:35:32.340]  Oh really?
[03:35:32.340 --> 03:35:34.340]  Oh yes, he was just taking the bus.
[03:35:34.340 --> 03:35:36.340]  Man bad pick himself.
[03:35:36.340 --> 03:35:43.340]  Yep, doing environmentally friendly transportation to show off I guess.
[03:35:43.340 --> 03:35:55.340]  Well that's a surprise because as the Daily Mail reports today, this climate change conference itself is going to cost something in the region of 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide.
[03:35:55.340 --> 03:36:05.340]  So again, all the private jets, you know, all the Boeing 747s that are taking these world leaders to this conference belching out carbon dioxide.
[03:36:05.340 --> 03:36:09.340]  But did you get a chance to speak to Al Gore?
[03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:16.340]  No, so I'm not a journalist Paul and I wanted to ask you, like, why aren't you any of you guys here covering this?
[03:36:16.340 --> 03:36:21.340]  I mean, this is a great opportunity to confront some politicians the Alex Jones way.
[03:36:21.340 --> 03:36:26.340]  Well yeah, it's probably a good idea. I mean, I was in Paris two weeks ago after the terror attacks.
[03:36:26.340 --> 03:36:31.340]  So yeah, it might be a good idea to get someone down there. We'll definitely talk about it.
[03:36:31.340 --> 03:36:33.340]  Thanks for the call, Walid.
[03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:41.340]  Now we're going to talk to John. He wants to talk about the viral video on Muslims. John, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:36:41.340 --> 03:36:43.340]  Paul, how are you doing today?
[03:36:43.340 --> 03:36:45.340]  Good, thanks.
[03:36:45.340 --> 03:36:51.340]  Very good. I saw this video this morning and I definitely encourage you guys to pick it up.
[03:36:51.340 --> 03:36:59.340]  This video went viral probably a few days ago. You can find it on liveleak.com and youtube.com.
[03:36:59.340 --> 03:37:09.340]  But this lady basically goes on to say that what people think over here in America about, you know, Muslims being good,
[03:37:09.340 --> 03:37:14.340]  there's a difference between good and bad, Muslims is the wrong way of looking at things.
[03:37:14.340 --> 03:37:24.340]  And that any Muslim who commits crime like ISIS has been doing is the perfect Muslim that's following what Muhammad has said to do.
[03:37:24.340 --> 03:37:29.340]  So I wasn't sure how that affects the way we should look at 9-11.
[03:37:29.340 --> 03:37:36.340]  I know that we usually talk, when we're talking about 9-11, we say the wrong country was blamed for it.
[03:37:36.340 --> 03:37:43.340]  But I didn't know if there was any true Muslim involvement in 9-11 or how that would change it.
[03:37:43.340 --> 03:37:51.340]  Because I know a lot of times we want to sit and say in the truth movement that, well, they're good and bad Muslims and everything.
[03:37:51.340 --> 03:38:00.340]  But coming from a former Muslim, this lady was a former Muslim, it sounds like you're not a real Muslim unless you commit jihad.
[03:38:00.340 --> 03:38:02.340]  Well, thanks for the call, John.
[03:38:02.340 --> 03:38:06.340]  Yeah, I came out with a video as well last week called The Truth About Islam.
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:14.340]  And of course, we hear again and again that, you know, these radicals, these extremists represent just a tiny minority of Muslims
[03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:19.340]  and that their extremism is the problem and that there's no issue with Islam itself.
[03:38:19.340 --> 03:38:22.340]  Well, of course, that's completely inaccurate.
[03:38:22.340 --> 03:38:28.340]  If you drill into the Quran and read what it says, read what it directs Muslims to do, it directs them.
[03:38:28.340 --> 03:38:35.340]  As you just mentioned there, somebody who left Islam, it directs them to kill those apostates who try and leave Islam
[03:38:35.340 --> 03:38:41.340]  and it directs them to kill the infidels and to wage war against people who bring corruption to the land,
[03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:46.340]  which is exactly the justification that ISIS gave after the Paris attacks.
[03:38:46.340 --> 03:38:54.340]  So again, you look at the polls which show that it's not a tiny minority of Muslims who, for example, support ISIS.
[03:38:54.340 --> 03:39:00.340]  Now, that doesn't mean that they're all going to strap on AK-47s and massacre people in a theater,
[03:39:00.340 --> 03:39:10.340]  but it shows that this politically correct idea of, you know, support for jihad being a tiny, tiny percentage of Muslims is completely wrong.
[03:39:10.340 --> 03:39:20.340]  Of course, there's a difference again between violent jihad and Islamism, but both want to impose Islamism on the West.
[03:39:20.340 --> 03:39:27.340]  When, of course, as we know, to maintain freedom and a liberal democracy, there should be separation between church and state.
[03:39:27.340 --> 03:39:31.340]  So the ones who want to impose Islamism want to do it politically.
[03:39:31.340 --> 03:39:36.340]  The ones who want to impose Islamism through jihad want to do it violently.
[03:39:36.340 --> 03:39:41.340]  And that's really the only difference, which is why huge numbers of Muslims support ISIS,
[03:39:41.340 --> 03:39:44.340]  because at the end of the day, they support the same goal.
[03:39:44.340 --> 03:39:50.340]  And that's why Islam is a problem, even though it's Islamophobic, even to say that,
[03:39:50.340 --> 03:39:57.340]  and that we need a reformation of Islam just as we had a reformation of Christianity.
[03:39:57.340 --> 03:40:02.340]  And those points are outlined, as I said in the video I made last week, the truth about Islam,
[03:40:02.340 --> 03:40:11.340]  and it's a subject that we continue to tackle, despite the fact that the left and the feminists don't talk about it,
[03:40:11.340 --> 03:40:17.340]  even though Islam itself is one of the most sexist, homophobic, racist religions,
[03:40:17.340 --> 03:40:21.340]  it's the most racist, homophobic, sexist religion on the planet,
[03:40:21.340 --> 03:40:26.340]  because of course, they still carry out those punishments against women,
[03:40:26.340 --> 03:40:32.340]  they're merely looking at a man twice, acid attacks, stoning people to death, throwing gays off buildings,
[03:40:32.340 --> 03:40:39.340]  not a word from the left, not a word from feminists, because again, in the oppression Olympics,
[03:40:39.340 --> 03:40:43.340]  the Muslims rank higher than the gays or the women,
[03:40:43.340 --> 03:40:50.340]  so they don't talk about it for fear of being called Islamophobic, complete intellectual cowardice.
[03:40:50.340 --> 03:40:55.340]  We do dare talk about it here on the Alex Jones Show and at Infowars.com.
[03:40:55.340 --> 03:40:58.340]  Let's go to another call here, who's been waiting longest.
[03:40:58.340 --> 03:41:02.340]  Gene and Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead Gene.
[03:41:02.340 --> 03:41:04.340]  Yes, sir.
[03:41:04.340 --> 03:41:11.340]  I think that we need to start attacking the elite's foundation while they're building the top of their pyramid.
[03:41:11.340 --> 03:41:18.340]  To me, the way we do that is we take away their funding and we support our own funding,
[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:25.340]  and the way to do that is we can run the country totally debt-free, the country would be totally out of debt,
[03:41:25.340 --> 03:41:30.340]  and there would be no taxation whatsoever, and how do you do that?
[03:41:30.340 --> 03:41:36.340]  Well, the government needs to be the bank and get the hell out of everything else,
[03:41:36.340 --> 03:41:42.340]  but if they're the bank and they can loan money to the people and then the interest on the money,
[03:41:42.340 --> 03:41:45.340]  the interest on the loans can pay for the government,
[03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:50.340]  so that's how we can run the country debt-free, and there would be no taxation whatsoever.
[03:41:50.340 --> 03:41:53.340]  What do you think about that, Paul?
[03:41:53.340 --> 03:41:58.340]  It's not something that I've personally investigated, Gene, but it sounds like an interesting idea.
[03:41:58.340 --> 03:41:59.340]  Thanks for the call.
[03:41:59.340 --> 03:42:01.340]  Tim, in Wyoming, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:05.340]  You want to talk about weather modification, go ahead, Tim.
[03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:06.340]  Yes, hi.
[03:42:06.340 --> 03:42:11.340]  I was interested in talking about weather modification because with the climate,
[03:42:11.340 --> 03:42:17.340]  the supposed climate change happening, or the uproar over explosive climate change,
[03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:22.340]  when this was probably 20, maybe 25 years ago,
[03:42:22.340 --> 03:42:29.340]  when China was first talking about building their Three Rivers Gorgeous project, I think it was,
[03:42:29.340 --> 03:42:32.340]  and then Russia also was doing something very similar at the same time.
[03:42:32.340 --> 03:42:41.340]  There was a large, I want to say a large number of people who knew about it,
[03:42:41.340 --> 03:42:44.340]  and it was not getting a lot of airplay, unfortunately.
[03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:50.340]  It was an Omni Magazine, which doesn't exist anymore,
[03:42:50.340 --> 03:42:55.340]  but of course, Omni Magazine actually did have science fiction and science facts,
[03:42:55.340 --> 03:43:01.340]  but at the same time, as I say, not many people talked about that or thought about it,
[03:43:01.340 --> 03:43:06.340]  and the weather modification electronically now today,
[03:43:06.340 --> 03:43:09.340]  of course, through chemtrails and various other things,
[03:43:09.340 --> 03:43:13.340]  they can basically, as Alex said at one time,
[03:43:13.340 --> 03:43:19.340]  they could have caused rain to happen on the Ho Chi Minh Trail at any time, any hour that they chose,
[03:43:19.340 --> 03:43:22.340]  and so that was available in the 60s.
[03:43:22.340 --> 03:43:29.340]  Now we're looking at much more advanced systems of weather modification,
[03:43:29.340 --> 03:43:36.340]  but when we have the large dam projects and the large water moving projects,
[03:43:36.340 --> 03:43:44.340]  it changes regional, we'll turn on transpiration, that's from trees,
[03:43:44.340 --> 03:43:46.340]  but regional evaporation rates.
[03:43:46.340 --> 03:43:50.340]  I mean, look at California, look what's happening in California.
[03:43:50.340 --> 03:43:53.340]  They're not getting any rain, so there's nothing evaporated,
[03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:56.340]  so there aren't any clouds to bring more rain.
[03:43:56.340 --> 03:44:00.340]  I mean, it's very little anyway, but that's basically what I wanted to say,
[03:44:00.340 --> 03:44:03.340]  but there was one other thing, one other comment I wanted to make.
[03:44:03.340 --> 03:44:06.340]  Every time I hear this, it makes me laugh.
[03:44:06.340 --> 03:44:10.340]  Alex Jones is the T-Rex of political talk,
[03:44:10.340 --> 03:44:14.340]  but he talked about the establishment of dinosaur media being dead,
[03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:16.340]  and so I thought that was kind of funny,
[03:44:16.340 --> 03:44:22.340]  unless he's a scavenger on the dead dinosaur media, which is what the T-Rex was.
[03:44:22.340 --> 03:44:25.340]  Anyway, that's about it, so thank you for taking my call,
[03:44:25.340 --> 03:44:27.340]  and that's about it.
[03:44:27.340 --> 03:44:29.340]  Okay, Tim, thanks for the call.
[03:44:29.340 --> 03:44:34.340]  Yeah, I mean, the point I make, and people talk about California,
[03:44:34.340 --> 03:44:38.340]  why would we trust them with any of these geoengineering projects?
[03:44:38.340 --> 03:44:44.340]  Because as I said, back in the 70s, they wanted to cover the polar ice caps with salt.
[03:44:44.340 --> 03:44:48.340]  Now they want to inject the stratosphere with sulfur.
[03:44:48.340 --> 03:44:52.340]  People have warned that that could have all kinds of unintended consequences,
[03:44:52.340 --> 03:44:54.340]  acid rain being one of them.
[03:44:54.340 --> 03:44:59.340]  And why would we trust them with these kind of technologies, these kind of programs,
[03:44:59.340 --> 03:45:03.340]  when they've been caught over and over again lying about global warming,
[03:45:03.340 --> 03:45:09.340]  faking temperature data to make this seem like a problem when it's not?
[03:45:09.340 --> 03:45:15.340]  And again, the other point is the programs that they've introduced to stop global warming
[03:45:15.340 --> 03:45:20.340]  and get us more reliant on, quote, renewable energy are a complete waste of money,
[03:45:20.340 --> 03:45:25.340]  a complete failure, and they've only served to massively cripple economies
[03:45:25.340 --> 03:45:27.340]  into which they're introduced.
[03:45:27.340 --> 03:45:30.340]  I mean, look at Spain's green economy, for example.
[03:45:30.340 --> 03:45:37.340]  You know, that caused a 50% youth unemployment rate, 25% unemployment rate in general.
[03:45:37.340 --> 03:45:39.340]  It was a complete catastrophe.
[03:45:39.340 --> 03:45:45.340]  And yet Obama tried to model his plan for America's green economy on the same model.
[03:45:45.340 --> 03:45:47.340]  Thankfully, it got more pushback.
[03:45:47.340 --> 03:45:51.340]  And of course, thanks to the miracle of shale in America,
[03:45:51.340 --> 03:45:57.340]  the economy didn't completely collapse like Spain's did back five, six, seven years ago.
[03:45:57.340 --> 03:46:01.340]  And again, all this money being spent on renewable energy,
[03:46:01.340 --> 03:46:09.340]  when the fact is solar power and wind power, while good for your private home for self-sufficiency,
[03:46:09.340 --> 03:46:14.340]  if you're talking about the world's global energy needs, they're completely useless.
[03:46:14.340 --> 03:46:19.340]  You know, it takes three decades after installing solar panels just to get your money back.
[03:46:19.340 --> 03:46:21.340]  And wind turbines are even worse.
[03:46:21.340 --> 03:46:24.340]  They're not just eyesores on the environment.
[03:46:24.340 --> 03:46:26.340]  They're ridiculously expensive.
[03:46:26.340 --> 03:46:29.340]  They break down all the time.
[03:46:29.340 --> 03:46:34.340]  And here's the key fact, they emit more carbon dioxide than they save.
[03:46:34.340 --> 03:46:40.340]  So the very reason for putting them in the first place is completely redundant.
[03:46:40.340 --> 03:46:45.340]  So even Bill Gates, and this is the point I'm making in the video,
[03:46:45.340 --> 03:46:50.340]  even Bill Gates has come out and said on numerous occasions that renewable energy can't do the job.
[03:46:50.340 --> 03:46:52.340]  It's total waste of money.
[03:46:52.340 --> 03:46:54.340]  It's not going to match.
[03:46:54.340 --> 03:46:57.340]  It's not going to meet the world's needs for energy.
[03:46:57.340 --> 03:47:04.340]  So all these green subsidies need to be switched immediately into R&D research and development
[03:47:04.340 --> 03:47:09.340]  for technological breakthroughs for an alternative energy source.
[03:47:09.340 --> 03:47:11.340]  And it's not going to be solar.
[03:47:11.340 --> 03:47:15.340]  It's not going to be wind power, because again, they're completely inadequate.
[03:47:15.340 --> 03:47:22.340]  And in the context of wind turbines, they actually emit more CO2 than they save.
[03:47:22.340 --> 03:47:28.340]  But this is still being pushed to date at this pointless climate summit in Paris,
[03:47:28.340 --> 03:47:32.340]  even though these so-called solutions have been completely debunked already.
[03:47:32.340 --> 03:47:37.340]  And then you have the other side of it, which is particularly infuriating.
[03:47:37.340 --> 03:47:39.340]  You get all the trendies, all the socialists.
[03:47:39.340 --> 03:47:46.340]  And in Sweden, I saw a picture of them waving the red hammer and sickle communist flag at a climate march.
[03:47:46.340 --> 03:47:52.340]  They go out and have these climate demos to look trendy and virtue signal to all their friends
[03:47:52.340 --> 03:47:57.340]  so they can get social brownie points about how environmentally conscious they are.
[03:47:57.340 --> 03:48:05.340]  And what they're advocating is actually impoverishing and slaughtering people in the third world, people of color.
[03:48:05.340 --> 03:48:09.340]  We had an article on Infowars.com back in 2011.
[03:48:09.340 --> 03:48:13.340]  Honduran farmers slaughtered in the name of global warming.
[03:48:13.340 --> 03:48:18.340]  23 farmers in Honduras, and this is happening in numerous different areas,
[03:48:18.340 --> 03:48:23.340]  were slaughtered in cold blood by hired mercenaries as they tried to protect their land
[03:48:23.340 --> 03:48:28.340]  from being seized by a corporation who wanted to use the land to produce biofuels
[03:48:28.340 --> 03:48:32.340]  as part of the United Nations accredited EU carbon trading scheme.
[03:48:32.340 --> 03:48:40.340]  So these programs to grow biofuels, they're actually going out on to pour impoverished people's land
[03:48:40.340 --> 03:48:46.340]  in countries like Honduras and massacring them at gunpoint in this case.
[03:48:46.340 --> 03:48:52.340]  To steal their land so they can grow biofuel on it for the United Nations.
[03:48:52.340 --> 03:48:57.340]  That's what these trendies are out advocating at these climate demos.
[03:48:57.340 --> 03:49:05.340]  So again, completely ludicrous. And this video I put out on Infowars.com really gets into this.
[03:49:05.340 --> 03:49:11.340]  Of course the polls now show that less and less people believe in manmade climate change,
[03:49:11.340 --> 03:49:14.340]  so we're at least making some progress on that score.
[03:49:14.340 --> 03:49:20.340]  But still these disastrous policies for the economy, for the development of third world economies
[03:49:20.340 --> 03:49:24.340]  to lift themselves out of poverty continue.
[03:49:24.340 --> 03:49:28.340]  And even though they've been discredited over and over again, they always move the gold posts.
[03:49:28.340 --> 03:49:32.340]  Back in the 70s it was global cooling. Then it was global warming.
[03:49:32.340 --> 03:49:40.340]  And then when the world stopped having global warming 18, 19 years ago, they changed it to climate change.
[03:49:40.340 --> 03:49:45.340]  And now it's extreme weather conditions. So it's basically any kind of weather whatsoever.
[03:49:45.340 --> 03:49:49.340]  It's all manmade climate change. It's all your fault.
[03:49:49.340 --> 03:49:53.340]  They're going to introduce carbon taxes for businesses, which you're going to pay higher prices for.
[03:49:53.340 --> 03:49:57.340]  So eventually it's going to hit you in the wallet.
[03:49:57.340 --> 03:50:04.340]  When extreme weather conditions are becoming less extreme, it's completely ridiculous.
[03:50:04.340 --> 03:50:09.340]  But they're still waffling through it at this climate summit in Paris.
[03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:13.340]  And Obama's up there saying that it's a stunning rebuke to ISIS.
[03:50:13.340 --> 03:50:21.340]  Like ISIS jihadists are going to be shaking in their boots because Obama's talking about global warming.
[03:50:21.340 --> 03:50:25.340]  I mean, where is the connection there? There's no connection whatsoever.
[03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:35.340]  And as I said earlier in the show, the Obama administration actually refused to bomb the ISIS oil fields in the name of the environment.
[03:50:35.340 --> 03:50:40.340]  The 15 months isn't that ironic?
[03:50:40.340 --> 03:50:48.340]  And then of course now they're giving them 45 minute warnings, the drivers of the oil tankers to flee before they even bomb those.
[03:50:48.340 --> 03:50:58.340]  So again, planet crazy. And Obama's up there in front of the U.N. talking more nonsense in the final segment of the Alex Jones show. Stay tuned.

[03:54:11.340 --> 03:54:15.340]  On Friday's show we had the interview with the lawyer for Gregory Allen Elliott.
[03:54:15.340 --> 03:54:20.340]  He was the Toronto artist who basically now faces six months in jail
[03:54:20.340 --> 03:54:23.340]  for disagreeing with a feminist on Twitter.
[03:54:23.340 --> 03:54:28.340]  That's now being considered to be criminal harassment in Toronto.
[03:54:28.340 --> 03:54:30.340]  That ruling is going to come down in January.
[03:54:30.340 --> 03:54:34.340]  But today I find out about another story involving a feminist.
[03:54:34.340 --> 03:54:41.340]  Basically she got into a debate with someone on Facebook with a man, God forbid,
[03:54:41.340 --> 03:54:44.340]  and he used the word slot during this debate.
[03:54:44.340 --> 03:54:49.340]  So this feminist, this cry bully feminist, Clementine Ford,
[03:54:49.340 --> 03:54:55.340]  she called up his place of employment, told them that he dared to use the word slot
[03:54:55.340 --> 03:55:00.340]  during a debate on Facebook. He was fired. His Christmas is completely ruined.
[03:55:00.340 --> 03:55:06.340]  So if he's got children and they're wondering what Christmas presents they're getting this year,
[03:55:06.340 --> 03:55:09.340]  they're getting nothing because this feminist has ruined his life,
[03:55:09.340 --> 03:55:13.340]  got him fired for using the word slot on Facebook.
[03:55:13.340 --> 03:55:15.340]  And again, this is why I make the point.
[03:55:15.340 --> 03:55:19.340]  This public shaming culture that feminists, you know,
[03:55:19.340 --> 03:55:22.340]  they've completely dominated over the past several years.
[03:55:22.340 --> 03:55:24.340]  It's a direct threat to free speech.
[03:55:24.340 --> 03:55:28.340]  It's a threat to people's livelihoods because they publicly shame people
[03:55:28.340 --> 03:55:32.340]  with this mob outrage culture and get them fired.
[03:55:32.340 --> 03:55:35.340]  And yet another example of it today.
[03:55:35.340 --> 03:55:39.340]  And of course as soon as I challenged this feminist on what she'd done,
[03:55:39.340 --> 03:55:42.340]  she blocked me on Twitter within minutes.
[03:55:42.340 --> 03:55:48.340]  So again, these cry bully feminists immediately retreat to their safe space
[03:55:48.340 --> 03:55:51.340]  as soon as they're challenged by anyone.
[03:55:51.340 --> 03:55:54.340]  So yet another example of that today.
[03:55:54.340 --> 03:55:58.340]  Let's go to another call here. Rob in Ontario, you're on the air Rob, go ahead.
[03:55:58.340 --> 03:56:00.340]  How are you?
[03:56:00.340 --> 03:56:07.340]  I want to maybe offer what I think is a tell about how these guys are disingenuine
[03:56:07.340 --> 03:56:12.340]  about using CO2 as the boogeyman for climate change.
[03:56:12.340 --> 03:56:14.340]  Joe.
[03:56:14.340 --> 03:56:17.340]  Well, I'm arguing that I guess maybe ostensibly it's because they want to use that
[03:56:17.340 --> 03:56:19.340]  to argue overpopulation or something.
[03:56:19.340 --> 03:56:25.340]  But what CO2, when you understand that you can sequester CO2,
[03:56:25.340 --> 03:56:29.340]  they're saying that agriculture is 40% of the problem.
[03:56:29.340 --> 03:56:32.340]  And really what they mean by agriculture, they mean grain production
[03:56:32.340 --> 03:56:37.340]  because grain is annual tillage and annual tillage means that you release the carbon
[03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:41.340]  that would be sequestered in the ground in the atmosphere.
[03:56:41.340 --> 03:56:46.340]  So if they were to, and the other argument that they're making about it is this livestock
[03:56:46.340 --> 03:56:50.340]  since methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas.
[03:56:50.340 --> 03:56:56.340]  And I'm not sure if methane is as strong as water vapor, say from chemtrails.
[03:56:56.340 --> 03:57:03.340]  But anyway, what I was going to say is that the CO2 model of,
[03:57:03.340 --> 03:57:10.340]  you get solved by changing our farming model with livestock back to mixed farming
[03:57:10.340 --> 03:57:15.340]  and then using grain free meat production.
[03:57:15.340 --> 03:57:21.340]  So for ruminants, cows, sheep and goats, you have them grass fed only.
[03:57:21.340 --> 03:57:26.340]  And it's been estimated by people at the Land Institute that have been looking at
[03:57:26.340 --> 03:57:31.340]  trying to solve annual grain production by coming up with perennial grains
[03:57:31.340 --> 03:57:36.340]  that you can sequester all of the CO2 that was released since the beginning
[03:57:36.340 --> 03:57:40.340]  of the industrial revolution within 10 years in that model.
[03:57:40.340 --> 03:57:43.340]  And so that's interesting. Thanks for the call.
[03:57:43.340 --> 03:57:45.340]  We've got about 50 seconds left.
[03:57:45.340 --> 03:57:50.340]  But of course, you remember the Plandopolis, the methane release from livestock,
[03:57:50.340 --> 03:57:55.340]  of course, that's one of the justifications they cite for rationing meat.
[03:57:55.340 --> 03:57:59.340]  Who else rationed meat as a form of controlling human behavior?
[03:57:59.340 --> 03:58:03.340]  The Communist Chinese as late as the 80s rationed meat.
[03:58:03.340 --> 03:58:08.340]  And in fact, it was a delicacy for people to eat meat once a month in China
[03:58:08.340 --> 03:58:10.340]  because of that very system.
[03:58:10.340 --> 03:58:13.340]  So again, it's all about controlling the development of the third world
[03:58:13.340 --> 03:58:18.340]  and it's about controlling, regulating the behavior of people at home.
[03:58:18.340 --> 03:58:21.340]  That's why it's nothing to do with saving the Earth.
[03:58:21.340 --> 03:58:24.340]  It's about expanding their power.
[03:58:24.340 --> 03:58:30.340]  We'll be covering it all week at infowars.com as this Paris Climate Summit goes on with more insanity.
[03:58:30.340 --> 03:58:31.340]  That's going to wrap it up.
[03:58:31.340 --> 03:58:35.340]  The fourth hour we'll be back in For Wars Nightly News Tonight live show tomorrow.
[03:58:35.340 --> 03:58:49.340]  It's going to do it for now, infowars.com. Thanks for joining.
