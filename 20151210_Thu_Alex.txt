[00:00.000 --> 00:13.420]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.420 --> 00:21.860]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.860 --> 00:27.960]  jones there aren't a day lose of scientific polls out yesterday and
[00:27.960 --> 00:33.800]  today showing that the majority of american voters agree with donald trump
[00:33.800 --> 00:39.000]  saying bar more muslims coming into the country as migrants as immigrants both
[00:39.000 --> 00:44.440]  legal or illegal or as refugees until they fixed the visa program and actually
[00:44.440 --> 00:49.280]  check the passports so what is the republican establishment and others
[00:49.280 --> 00:54.200]  going to do now ran paul has come out with a piece basically supporting trump
[00:54.200 --> 00:57.840]  which I think is a good change pointing out that it's Obama that should be
[00:57.840 --> 01:02.880]  stepping down that it's obama that's not qualified to be president certainly is
[01:02.880 --> 01:06.960]  the person who qualifies who can be president we got a bunch of big guests
[01:06.960 --> 01:12.920]  today but first a report from john bound obama and company would have us all
[01:12.920 --> 01:17.960]  believe that gun ownership must be heavily regulated these comments stem
[01:17.960 --> 01:22.840]  from a fabricated culture of fear to be believed by our big daddy government
[01:22.840 --> 01:29.080]  sorry kids it turns out big daddy is a compulsive liar as gun sales have gone
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.680]  up gun violence has gone down well unless you're counting big daddy's gun
[01:34.680 --> 01:38.960]  free zones mother jones magazine did their best to attempt to point out that
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.320]  gun violence victims were increasing problem is that data was gathered
[01:44.320 --> 01:50.760]  exclusively from gun free zones according to the washington post in 1993
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.880]  there were seven homicides by firearm for every hundred thousand americans
[01:54.880 --> 01:59.240]  according to a pew research center analysis of data from the centers for
[01:59.240 --> 02:05.120]  disease control and prevention by 2013 that figure had fallen by nearly half to
[02:05.120 --> 02:10.840]  3.6 a total of eleven thousand two hundred and eight firearm homicides the
[02:10.840 --> 02:16.040]  number of victims of crimes involving guns that did not result in death such as
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.880]  robberies declined even more precipitously from seven twenty five per a hundred
[02:20.880 --> 02:28.480]  thousand people in 1993 to 175 in 2013 in 2008 the supreme court ruled in
[02:28.480 --> 02:32.760]  district of columbia versus heller that individual firearm possession is
[02:32.760 --> 02:37.840]  constitutionally protected especially when it comes to self-defense and as the
[02:37.840 --> 02:43.200]  gun crime victims numbers decreased american gun ownership began to sky
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.240]  rocket president obama's rhetoric and life-threatening policies have served to
[02:48.240 --> 02:53.800]  sell over a hundred million guns since he took office i guess some things do
[02:53.800 --> 02:57.680]  happen overnight it's not gonna happen overnight change cannot happen overnight
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.440]  and the changes we seek won't always happen overnight the economic challenges
[03:01.440 --> 03:06.720]  that we face weren't created overnight they're not going to be solved overnight
[03:06.720 --> 03:10.920]  a crisis this deep didn't happen overnight nothing worth doing happens
[03:10.920 --> 03:14.040]  overnight we should not expect change to happen overnight i don't think it's
[03:14.040 --> 03:18.440]  going to happen overnight regardless the totalitarian left continues to
[03:18.440 --> 03:23.480]  threaten our second amendment rights but these these latest incidents in in
[03:23.480 --> 03:28.840]  colorado and now california raises two questions one are we mature enough as a
[03:28.840 --> 03:32.560]  country to look in the mirror and say we have a gun problem you know a twelve
[03:32.560 --> 03:35.960]  step program starts with you got to acknowledge you have a problem are we
[03:35.960 --> 03:40.240]  mature enough to to acknowledge that a treasonous shadow government shows
[03:40.240 --> 03:44.800]  their illegal hand by the very policies they set forth case in point
[03:44.800 --> 03:49.520]  obama begged from the oval office to administer an unconstitutional no-fly
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.440]  list while opening the floodgates for potential terrorists to enter the
[03:53.440 --> 04:01.720]  united states as of 2013 the no-fly list included 47,000 people up from 16
[04:01.720 --> 04:07.200]  people after george w bush created it american residents and us veterans have
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.800]  routinely been put on the list by mistake to begin with congress should act
[04:11.800 --> 04:17.560]  to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun today the aclu was in
[04:17.560 --> 04:21.800]  a federal court arguing that people on the list cannot access the full
[04:21.800 --> 04:27.560]  evidence against them receive a hearing or cross-examine witnesses against them
[04:27.560 --> 04:32.360]  analysts are saying that the aclu may actually win this thing according to the
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.840]  rights granted by the constitution in the bill of rights they already have the
[04:36.840 --> 04:41.520]  lunacy behind the no-fly list should have put the bush administration under

[08:13.400 --> 08:21.880]  I was five and he was six we rode on horses made of sticks he woke black and
[08:21.880 --> 08:26.160]  I was white. Come on let's just shoot Claire.
[08:26.160 --> 08:35.160]  Hey I need to get the ramp, the ramp to drop the ramp I got a wounded girl we need to take the rough the mile.
[08:35.160 --> 08:43.160]  The main reason we went under rack at the time was we thought he had weapons of mass destruction
[08:43.160 --> 08:47.240]  it turns out he didn't but he had the capacity to make weapons of mass destruction but also talked
[08:47.240 --> 08:52.600]  about the human suffering in Iraq. Hello boys and girls I have a special message
[08:52.600 --> 08:56.920]  for you from the president of the United States I salute the boys and girls who
[08:56.920 --> 09:00.920]  are buying United States savings stamps and bonds and they're giving important
[09:00.920 --> 09:06.440]  support to the cause of freedom and the men who fight for us in Vietnam the
[09:06.440 --> 09:15.120]  Congress gave us this authority in August 1964 to do whatever may be
[09:15.120 --> 09:20.960]  necessary that's pretty far-reaching that's the sky is the limit. As an American
[09:20.960 --> 09:23.880]  citizen you have to respect our president whether I like it or not it's
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.080]  really not my decision but I do respect my president and I will support
[09:28.080 --> 09:42.240]  whatever decision he makes.
[09:42.240 --> 10:05.040]  It is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties.
[10:05.040 --> 10:09.920]  The United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.
[10:09.920 --> 10:13.760]  Well the first thing they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone
[10:13.760 --> 10:17.040]  program you're not even to discuss that it exists.
[10:17.040 --> 10:24.080]  Renewed hostile actions against United States ships on the ICs and the Gulf of
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.680]  Compton have today required me to order the military forces of the United States
[10:30.680 --> 10:38.680]  to take action and reply. Crashing through the lies and
[10:38.680 --> 10:47.120]  disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. That's right it's Alex
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.160]  Jones live is the 19-year-old name of the syndicated radio broadcast but on
[10:52.160 --> 10:56.960]  air 21 years basically but 19 years syndicated but that's because stations
[10:56.960 --> 11:00.200]  like you to call it the Alex Jones show so that people could fill out their
[11:00.200 --> 11:04.760]  little arbitrant booklets and people knew what show they were listening to but
[11:04.760 --> 11:09.400]  as the media has evolved really this is just in full wars live. This is the big
[11:09.400 --> 11:16.800]  live 4-hour radio TV broadcast that is reaching more than 20 million people a
[11:16.800 --> 11:21.720]  week now worldwide and it's bigger than Alex Jones. It's bigger than Jakari
[11:21.720 --> 11:26.240]  Jackson or Darren McBreen or Rob Do or Leigh Ann McAdoo or all the other great
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.880]  reporters and crew like David Knight and countless others. It's about you the
[11:31.880 --> 11:36.320]  viewers you the listeners and the photos you send us the articles you send us
[11:36.320 --> 11:42.920]  the tips you send us the feedback you give us and the friends and family and
[11:42.920 --> 11:46.920]  neighbors and colleagues and random strangers that you tell about the
[11:46.920 --> 11:54.200]  broadcast. You are the resistance that's why we have so many contests at least
[11:54.200 --> 11:58.680]  ten a year and I want to have more. We've done two the last week with quick
[11:58.680 --> 12:05.800]  turnarounds and announce the winners where we showcase people out there that
[12:05.800 --> 12:10.680]  are listeners and their own analysis of the president's draconian anti-gun
[12:10.680 --> 12:15.760]  anti-due process speech Sunday illustrating the power of the people
[12:15.760 --> 12:21.640]  and the two winning videos the winner and the runner-up were as good as
[12:21.640 --> 12:25.800]  anything I could say they were as good as anything my crew would do it was
[12:25.800 --> 12:32.240]  excellent and we had another contest about the attack on Christmas or on
[12:32.240 --> 12:36.880]  Christmas it was a two-day turnaround hundreds of great submissions that we
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.280]  were able to put out on Facebook and Twitter reaching millions of people one
[12:40.280 --> 12:45.160]  of the memes alone reached like 300,000 people on Facebook we could see the
[12:45.160 --> 12:50.640]  numbers and that's you taking action and it's about illustrating that you are
[12:50.640 --> 12:57.600]  important you are the fount the baseline of the resistance and the change does
[12:57.600 --> 13:02.720]  come from the grassroots up and then we are not astroturf we are humans that
[13:02.720 --> 13:07.960]  want to be free we are Christians we are agnostics we are northerners we are
[13:07.960 --> 13:14.040]  southerners they're Muslims they're Jews you name it and I do know atheists out
[13:14.040 --> 13:16.360]  there that don't like the new world order don't want to be slaves as well and
[13:16.360 --> 13:20.400]  look we all have differences but at the end of the day we're not criminals we
[13:20.400 --> 13:23.520]  don't want to feed on innocent people we don't want to live under an unelected
[13:23.520 --> 13:28.480]  worldwide tyranny that they've tried to deny they were setting up for decades
[13:28.480 --> 13:33.240]  now that it's here they don't deny it they say you will be assimilated submit
[13:33.240 --> 13:42.440]  well I'm not submitting I'm not laying down in the dirt I'm taking action but
[13:42.440 --> 13:47.040]  last week when we had Donald Trump on we have one of his chief advisors on for an
[13:47.040 --> 13:53.880]  hour and a half today Roger Stone his former campaign head of his exploratory
[13:53.880 --> 13:58.720]  committee four years ago and then earlier this year he'll be joining us for an
[13:58.720 --> 14:02.280]  hour and a half to get into not just Donald Trump but where the whole country
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.040]  and the world's going and he's run major US operations in third-world countries
[14:07.040 --> 14:12.280]  and other nations try to get pro US pro constitutional pro free market people
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.680]  elected so he knows what he's talking about when he gets into elections we're
[14:16.680 --> 14:20.640]  going to be really going over all of this and different strategies not just to
[14:20.640 --> 14:26.800]  get Donald Trump in or another constitutionalist patriot type but to
[14:26.800 --> 14:30.720]  win at the state level you name it and where he sees the trends going for this
[14:30.720 --> 14:36.280]  country but last week you know jacari Jackson said well congratulations getting
[14:36.280 --> 14:41.600]  Donald Trump on you know that's really good for you and I and I said no jacari
[14:41.600 --> 14:46.040]  congratulations to you and everybody else in the M4's operation and the
[14:46.040 --> 14:51.760]  listeners and everyone because Donald Trump isn't God he's not the end all be
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.720]  all he makes mistakes but he is a true maverick the point is that a Matt Drudge
[14:56.720 --> 15:02.520]  would travel here to see us when he doesn't give anybody else interviews when
[15:02.520 --> 15:08.200]  a Donald Trump comes on this show knowing full well that it would be
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.240]  controversial and they would attack him for it what does it signify and so many
[15:12.240 --> 15:17.040]  other issues that the mainstream media isn't the mainstream media anymore they
[15:17.040 --> 15:24.280]  are the dead dinosaur fossilized Decepticon media and the only answer is
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.760]  thumbing our nose at them the only answer is treating them with disdain and
[15:29.760 --> 15:37.800]  announcing them by the ancient name of enemy enemy see how you like that we're
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.080]  not going to respond by being intimidated by you by groveling to you so many
[15:42.080 --> 15:45.840]  these politicians don't get it they don't understand it this is about a
[15:45.840 --> 15:51.440]  revolution of not being cowed of standing up of being informed and getting
[15:51.440 --> 15:55.800]  in the globalist faces because we've gotten in this position by behaving
[15:55.800 --> 16:02.280]  like servile sheep you know they twist the Bible so much the entire Bible is
[16:02.280 --> 16:05.360]  people standing up against tyrants defeating them or being killed in the
[16:05.360 --> 16:12.880]  process torture do you name it but then to Christ we are to be as sheep to God
[16:12.880 --> 16:17.960]  we are to be as sheep not waging war against God and God's plan but we are
[16:17.960 --> 16:24.200]  to resist until the end and wage war against the world's plan well they've
[16:24.200 --> 16:29.360]  turned that around these churches they go be like little sheepies and and the
[16:29.360 --> 16:32.480]  Lord wants you to do whatever the government says or whatever a bully
[16:32.480 --> 16:37.960]  says because that's what the Lord said of the Lord beat the money changers in
[16:37.960 --> 16:45.680]  the temple who had been saying they wanted to killing with a cat or nine
[16:45.680 --> 16:51.040]  tail basically a multi-ended whip and overturned tables and basically you can
[16:51.040 --> 16:55.200]  read the three Gospels beat a bunch of people up he won on a rampage and beat
[16:55.200 --> 17:04.480]  up about 25 people is that very lamb like no he was illustrating this is the
[17:04.480 --> 17:08.960]  enemy not the prostitutes not even the tax collectors not the corrupt Roman
[17:08.960 --> 17:14.280]  police the problem was those claiming they represented God sitting in front
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.720]  of the temple making people go buy a special coin for about depending on the
[17:19.720 --> 17:26.560]  era ten times what it was worth to pay for a sacrifice they wouldn't let them
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.680]  pay with general coin they made him buy a special rare coin and it was basically
[17:31.680 --> 17:40.200]  money manipulation and so Christ came in and overturned the tables and beat
[17:40.200 --> 17:49.160]  them with a whip and basically kick them physically boom kicking them out ran
[17:49.160 --> 17:55.640]  them out some accounts are he beat up more like 50 plus people and it was a
[17:55.640 --> 18:02.840]  large group of men the money changers that he beat up Jesus Christ beat them
[18:02.840 --> 18:09.960]  up all of them and that's that's how it was supposed to be Christ like right see
[18:09.960 --> 18:13.760]  Christ knew when to hold him knew when to fold him knew when to walk away knew
[18:13.760 --> 18:17.480]  when to run and knew when to not run when it was time for him to make the
[18:17.480 --> 18:20.240]  ultimate sacrifice
[18:22.880 --> 18:29.400]  and his flesh didn't want to do it in the garden did it so please take this
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.520]  better cup away envisioning all the beating the torturing he's gonna go
[18:33.520 --> 18:38.720]  through over the next couple days but then his spirit stood him right back up
[18:38.720 --> 18:43.680]  spirit of the father and he walked out to do his duty and it's the spirit
[18:43.680 --> 18:48.840]  animating flesh that is going to save this planet it's not gonna be the world
[18:48.840 --> 18:53.760]  it's not gonna be super science those are all great gifts God's given us with
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.240]  our minds it's going to be the spirit I don't mean to go off into preaching today
[18:57.240 --> 19:02.160]  when I come back I'm promise I'm gonna control myself and I'm gonna go over all
[19:02.160 --> 19:05.680]  of the huge and I say huge I've got to get to this economic news I've got to
[19:05.680 --> 19:09.480]  get to the military news I've got to get to the internet censorship news but
[19:09.480 --> 19:13.120]  obviously first because it's a free speech issue it's a major political
[19:13.120 --> 19:20.160]  issue it's a war between old media and new media issue but the attempted
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.200]  political assassination of Donald Trump and the legions of cowards on the left
[19:25.200 --> 19:31.120]  and the right lining up to beat their chest and look at the man in the arena
[19:31.120 --> 19:36.240]  the gladiator out number 10 to 1 defeating the enemy and to say that's
[19:36.240 --> 19:42.080]  the bad man oh we're better than him he's a bigot but you notice the American
[19:42.080 --> 19:47.360]  people in major polls agree with them we're gonna break it all down straight
[19:47.360 --> 19:54.360]  ahead on the other side of this break you're listening and watching the Alex

[20:21.360 --> 20:25.760]  I've made predictions like this before a few years ago I warned that the housing
[20:25.760 --> 20:30.280]  prices would collapse before that I warned that dot-com companies would
[20:30.280 --> 20:35.440]  crash and they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this
[20:35.440 --> 20:40.320]  has nothing to do with the stock market this will affect us all I've posted a

[24:04.000 --> 24:15.200]  Alex Jones show coming up at the bottom of the second hour we're going to have
[24:15.200 --> 24:20.960]  a presidential advisor to nine administrations Roger Stone joining us via
[24:20.960 --> 24:27.440]  video Skype pretty much Trump's top advisor one of his top advisors will be
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.920]  joining us to talk all things planet Trump and election 2016 and then in a
[24:32.920 --> 24:37.200]  couple weeks he's going to be in the studio with us again really impressive
[24:37.200 --> 24:41.240]  that he's been able to get on Discovery Channel History Channel Bill Maher CNN
[24:41.240 --> 24:47.200]  Fox News you name it basically laying out what Trump really wants to do and so
[24:47.200 --> 24:51.080]  he'll give us the long-form inside baseball interview coming up in about an
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.240]  hour and five minutes from now also we're going to get some guests on the
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.680]  next few weeks professors and others going over the fact that gun crime is
[25:00.680 --> 25:06.080]  continuing to plunge since 1992 now it's over 60% I've been corrected not 50
[25:06.080 --> 25:12.080]  plus the only thing that's up is gun free zone of victim disarmament zones and
[25:12.080 --> 25:17.880]  that's up depending on which number you look at 25% or more in the last decade
[25:17.880 --> 25:24.040]  because they advertise you know crazies go do this just like when they advertise
[25:24.040 --> 25:28.160]  death by cop where you go pull a gun on a cop and people then go do it right
[25:28.160 --> 25:32.400]  after that happens the more you cover it the more it happens that's why Trump's
[25:32.400 --> 25:34.960]  come out and said don't give these terrorists attention don't call them
[25:34.960 --> 25:40.520]  heroes you know don't have the media make it sexy that's what contributes well
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.000]  back in the 70s we had real terror in this country with leftist blowing stuff
[25:44.000 --> 25:47.760]  up on almost a weekly basis and the way they went away was to stop giving them
[25:47.760 --> 25:51.760]  attention and to stop negotiating with them and to stop giving them ransoms
[25:51.760 --> 25:58.920]  like they did in the 60s it ended in a few years so that's some of what's
[25:58.920 --> 26:06.080]  coming up but they are really spending this big time and we've had professor
[26:06.080 --> 26:09.640]  lot and others on saying the new assault on our guns was coming our right to
[26:09.640 --> 26:12.760]  self-defense and then they would use fake statistics to do it
[26:12.760 --> 26:17.720]  Bloomberg is literally already spent 500 million the last few years on
[26:17.720 --> 26:20.840]  anti-gun initiatives they're talking about spending even more on fake
[26:20.840 --> 26:27.200]  statistics Jerry Falwell's Liberty University to allow guns and dorms that
[26:27.200 --> 26:33.680]  is going to be a great idea criminals are just going to bring guns anyways and
[26:33.680 --> 26:40.200]  by the way when my dad was in high school he used to bring a shotgun with
[26:40.200 --> 26:43.640]  him because he'd go hunting with friends after school and he was in a rural
[26:43.640 --> 26:48.120]  school but it was a big one but folks will tell you just 30 years ago in
[26:48.120 --> 26:53.360]  New York City they had shooting clubs in high schools it's not the person that
[26:53.360 --> 26:56.960]  brings a rifle to school that kills everybody it's not the rifle that did
[26:56.960 --> 27:00.080]  it it's that a criminal is going to bring a gun a crazy gonna bring a gun
[27:00.080 --> 27:08.200]  regardless and I know that our audience already knows this but they can show you
[27:08.200 --> 27:12.880]  a limited graph one of the rarest forms of death by gun is a mass shooting in
[27:12.880 --> 27:18.120]  fact it's the most rare and they can show that up but overall guns killing
[27:18.120 --> 27:23.240]  people is down even criminals it's down you know why because they always add
[27:23.240 --> 27:26.840]  those of the 12,000 number every year suicides you name it criminals aren't
[27:26.840 --> 27:30.480]  doing as many home invasions or carjackings nationwide because even in
[27:30.480 --> 27:34.280]  places like Chicago and New York and DC people are just packing illegally now
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.160]  law-abiding citizens realize the systems against them now they're not going along
[27:39.160 --> 27:44.920]  with it that'd mean to go off into guns it's just it's such a big deal that
[27:44.920 --> 27:49.600]  they're trying to deceive the public now a large minority of Americans of every
[27:49.600 --> 27:53.560]  race color and creed and religion have gotten guns have gotten the security are
[27:53.560 --> 28:00.000]  using it know the facts the one area we're losing isn't even the in the
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  opinion for guns that's more positive now than negative for the first time in
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.440]  decades you can look that up but with a majority of people even though they're
[28:10.440 --> 28:15.400]  still pro-gun they believe gun crime is up they've got pure research Mason
[28:15.400 --> 28:20.680]  Dixon Zogby Fox polls New York Times polls LA Times polls you can just type
[28:20.680 --> 28:25.920]  in gun crime down public thinks it's way up you'll get articles from the
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.240]  Washington Post LA Times you name it they even admit this and it's a triumph
[28:30.240 --> 28:33.880]  of ignorance now I'll tell you it backfired on them people think there's
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.120]  so much killing and so much murder going on that they are running out and
[28:38.120 --> 28:44.000]  buying guns to them protect themselves because they think there's more crime
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.960]  and they want to protect themselves when there's not so it shows how
[28:48.960 --> 28:52.640]  propaganda can backfire sometimes because they ask people why'd you buy a
[28:52.640 --> 28:56.120]  gun well because of the crime epidemic and because of the home invasion
[28:56.120 --> 29:00.520]  epidemic and everything and that's because the media covers all that because
[29:00.520 --> 29:05.040]  if it bleeds it leads and so again it creates a perception there's all this
[29:05.040 --> 29:09.360]  crime and all these guns and so folks want to have an equalizer so they go out
[29:09.360 --> 29:14.520]  and they buy guns to protect themselves from the criminals but the false
[29:14.520 --> 29:17.640]  beliefs actually having a positive effect because we would have seen a
[29:17.640 --> 29:21.480]  crime rate explosion we have some we've seen an increase in some areas a little
[29:21.480 --> 29:25.440]  bit but still overall down because the economy's in the crapper we've got
[29:25.440 --> 29:28.800]  criminal immigrants a percentage of them pouring in from all over the world
[29:28.800 --> 29:31.640]  criminals being thrown out of their countries are running they're all
[29:31.640 --> 29:36.480]  coming here from Germany to Mexico you know from South Africa to Japan you
[29:36.480 --> 29:40.080]  name it they're coming here this is the happy hunting ground but they're afraid
[29:40.080 --> 29:43.800]  to do violent crimes because they get their butt shot off a lot of petty
[29:43.800 --> 29:48.480]  crime snatching grabs that's all up by the way
[29:48.480 --> 29:55.480]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:55.480 --> 29:57.920]  network
[29:59.800 --> 30:05.640]  retired basketball or Karim Abdul-Jabbar is calling Trump the ISIS candidate he
[30:05.640 --> 30:09.800]  says the GOP frontrunner is doing ISIS's work for them by praying on
[30:09.800 --> 30:14.160]  people's understandable fear to coerce support according to Abdul-Jabbar
[30:14.160 --> 30:18.280]  Trump's political stance might make people transcend abstraction and
[30:18.280 --> 30:22.280]  actually commit acts of violence he fails to point out though the countless
[30:22.280 --> 30:26.240]  people on the left calling for violence against Trump now naturally
[30:26.240 --> 30:29.680]  there's been no condemnation against this violent and hateful rhetoric
[30:29.680 --> 30:34.720]  probably claiming it's justified because of Trump's crazy talk calling to
[30:34.720 --> 30:39.480]  temporarily halt Muslims from entering the country until the vetting process is
[30:39.480 --> 30:44.840]  fixed Hilary calls this un-American and against our values ignoring that this

[34:05.720 --> 34:10.280]  Guzman reportedly threatened ISIS at its militants destroyed one of his
[34:10.280 --> 34:14.080]  shipments sent to the Middle East El Chapo apparently wrote an encrypted email
[34:14.080 --> 34:20.040]  to ISIS leader Baghdadi al-Baghdadi threatening to destroy ISIS if they
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.480]  continue to interfere with the business of the Sinaloa cartel according to
[34:23.480 --> 34:28.240]  Mexican blogger with strong ties the cartel you ISIS are not soldiers you're
[34:28.240 --> 34:34.040]  nothing but lowly bleepies the email stated your God cannot save you from
[34:34.040 --> 34:38.560]  the true terror that my men will levy at you to continue to impact my operation
[34:38.560 --> 34:42.840]  my men will destroy you the world is not yours dictate I pay the next son of a
[34:42.840 --> 34:46.920]  whore that tries to interfere with the business of Sinaloa cartel I will have
[34:46.920 --> 34:53.280]  their heart and tongue torn from them the email added and of course that's
[34:53.280 --> 35:01.000]  El Chapo completely connected to CIA and all these other groups for decades and
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.760]  then of course they turned against even burned a bunch of his people and they
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.360]  came out in court said we work for the CIA and declare their national security
[35:07.360 --> 35:12.720]  code names and they were all released of course in Chicago a few years ago that's
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.000]  my problem with the drug war it's so fake I mean the big banks run it direct it
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.960]  the government protects it they bust low level idiots that try to cut it on the
[35:20.960 --> 35:29.920]  trade they even burn their own people I mean I'm just tired of it and ISIS just
[35:29.920 --> 35:36.240]  is a ragtag group of idiots who no one has stood up to and now that Russia is
[35:36.240 --> 35:41.120]  bombing the daylights out of them and they're in a few months collapsing Turkey
[35:41.120 --> 35:44.880]  and others are basically attacking the Russians and now the US has been bombing
[35:44.880 --> 35:52.520]  Syrian military bases and directing Al Nuzra Al Qaeda ISIS artillery I mean they
[35:52.520 --> 35:57.440]  give them toe missiles artillery and rocket launchers and mortars and then
[35:57.440 --> 36:03.200]  they give them GPS coordinate grid systems to aim them they don't fully
[36:03.200 --> 36:06.160]  control them then because they tell them that don't when you use the chemical
[36:06.160 --> 36:12.000]  weapons on Aleppo don't video it and put it out they don't listen they load the
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.080]  big Saudi Arabian chemical weapon mortar up you know 70 pound mortar launch it
[36:18.080 --> 36:25.200]  and scream Allah Akbar Allah back daddy and that goes on and then everybody
[36:25.200 --> 36:29.320]  goes this is your people launch the chemicals and then and then Al Nuzra
[36:29.320 --> 36:34.240]  and Al Qaeda and ISIS go on TV and go yes we did ha ha ha I mean that's how
[36:34.240 --> 36:40.560]  stupid they are is the West sends them in there twice with chemical weapons to
[36:40.560 --> 36:46.040]  blame Assad and they want to be rock stars on the internet so they videotape
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.080]  themselves doing it I mean these really are a group of scum they're not even good
[36:50.080 --> 36:59.280]  at what they do and what does it say about us that we have turned these people
[36:59.280 --> 37:05.560]  loose and their real power isn't the 200 plus thousand fighters they've got they
[37:05.560 --> 37:09.080]  bring behind them their women and their children who then take over the houses
[37:09.080 --> 37:14.160]  and the farms of the Muslims and Christians they've kicked out and then
[37:14.160 --> 37:18.360]  they just won't leave and then they squat in the houses and try to make the
[37:18.360 --> 37:23.040]  Syrian army that's very small but under attack from Turkey and others fight
[37:23.040 --> 37:32.000]  them house to house so it's very despicable we'll be getting to all of
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.360]  that here today I'm gonna get a Donald Trump now here in just a moment then I'm
[37:37.360 --> 37:40.760]  gonna open the phones up to get your take for first-time callers on this
[37:40.760 --> 37:46.520]  Thursday worldwide broadcast the 10th day of December 2015 on where you think
[37:46.520 --> 37:50.640]  Trump's really going is Trump good is Trump bad do you trust him what do you
[37:50.640 --> 37:55.280]  think of my views of Trump I'll give that number out in a moment not yet so we
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.680]  get a comment on what I say and tell me if you agree or disagree I'm gonna have
[38:00.680 --> 38:03.680]  CJ who's a really great engineer and technical guy come in here and talk
[38:03.680 --> 38:07.520]  about this and maybe tomorrow Tim Fruget because he's the guy that got this
[38:07.520 --> 38:13.160]  deal done we go out to trade publications because I'm no expert and we
[38:13.160 --> 38:18.000]  go out and do our research then we check on it to try to bring people things
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.200]  that are truly game-changers it's like we did just sell out of the thousand
[38:23.200 --> 38:27.960]  battery packs that is a third the size of a briefcase the container has jumper
[38:27.960 --> 38:31.800]  cables all the different adapters you can imagine and then the little charger
[38:31.800 --> 38:35.160]  that has all the different ports different plug-ins and a big flashlight on
[38:35.160 --> 38:40.760]  it normally sells for over 150 we got it we're selling it for 119 and you
[38:40.760 --> 38:51.240]  notice it sold out we had to pay for a hundred of these we had to pay for a
[38:51.240 --> 38:58.000]  hundred of these and now the new system is in that that's the old system and I
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.280]  was told to sold out as of this morning info or solar based station power
[39:02.280 --> 39:08.440]  supply now this is more heavy-duty this is the size of a larger suitcase not a
[39:08.440 --> 39:11.960]  huge suitcase but a medium size suitcase you'd roll through the airport it's
[39:11.960 --> 39:15.520]  exactly the same with the wheels on it and everything but it's even more sturdy
[39:15.520 --> 39:20.400]  it's got the high quality latest generation solar panels we had this
[39:20.400 --> 39:26.440]  private labeled so we could offer it and I'm not exaggerating for one half the
[39:26.440 --> 39:31.240]  leading competitor who you hear advertising all over talk radio one
[39:31.240 --> 39:38.000]  half the leading one half the leading competitor and this has more power this
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.640]  is better hands down or I'd be selling the other one I have before years ago
[39:43.640 --> 39:47.920]  things get better things innovate this is the best type of solar panel I'm told
[39:47.920 --> 39:54.200]  last longer is better CJ knows all about I'm gonna have him explain it the point
[39:54.200 --> 39:58.680]  is you can read all the specs at info or store.com info or solar base station
[39:58.680 --> 40:02.880]  power supply you put this on your house you put the battery supply and controls
[40:02.880 --> 40:07.520]  in your home and you can power a ton of stuff with it you buy three or four of
[40:07.520 --> 40:11.920]  these you can run you know pretty good size house on it you can definitely run
[40:11.920 --> 40:15.920]  your hunting shack your fishing shack your fishing cabin your emergency camp
[40:15.920 --> 40:22.680]  with this I mean this is really the latest cutting edge and we've got 100 of
[40:22.680 --> 40:28.640]  them and the small profit we make on each one will fund this operation so we
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.520]  did a lot of research took us years I know exaggeration basically crack the
[40:33.520 --> 40:36.640]  whip around here for years to innovate to get the latest cutting edge stuff
[40:36.640 --> 40:40.160]  that's been out for a little while been vetted and proven to be good we don't
[40:40.160 --> 40:43.600]  just take what just comes out but what's been out for a year or so what's been
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.260]  vetted what has the best reviews that we go by a bunch of them private label it
[40:47.260 --> 40:52.960]  to then go to a new low price it's called free market capitalism we engage in it
[40:52.960 --> 40:56.840]  we don't just preach it we literally walk by it we don't just talk the talk we
[40:56.840 --> 41:02.160]  walk the walk big time so M4 solar base power station he'll pop in for five
[41:02.160 --> 41:05.960]  minutes right before our guest joins us next hour CJ will be in studio they're

[43:28.200 --> 43:37.040]  this is like a fumble in a sudden death over time NFL Super Bowl game the
[43:37.040 --> 43:39.800]  globalists are fumbling all the time but used to there wasn't somebody there to
[43:39.800 --> 43:43.680]  point it out the controlled globalist media would cover it up we're there
[43:43.680 --> 43:48.000]  pointing out the screw ups pointing out when they lose possession of the ball
[43:48.000 --> 43:54.400]  and quite frankly info wars other than drudge world net daily and now Donald
[43:54.400 --> 43:59.480]  Trump and RT I just give credit where it's due that's why they admit NATO wants
[43:59.480 --> 44:02.720]  RT banned and jammed in Europe they've already basically got it kicked off most
[44:02.720 --> 44:07.080]  systems here in the US they told RT two years ago you have Alex Jones on anymore
[44:07.080 --> 44:11.360]  we will take your license they were actually visited by Homeland Security
[44:11.360 --> 44:15.320]  and by the way I can't tell you who else was visited by Homeland Security over a
[44:15.320 --> 44:20.440]  TV show you know I've got three shows on history and discovery they're airing
[44:20.440 --> 44:23.520]  right now where I'm basically the main host of them they didn't pay me to do it
[44:23.520 --> 44:26.640]  but I'm gonna be for like four hours that I'm in ten episodes as the main guy
[44:26.640 --> 44:32.080]  you know of all these different shows and forget all the names of them the
[44:32.080 --> 44:36.480]  people see them I don't really watch a lot TV but there was another very big
[44:36.480 --> 44:41.480]  popular show that I was on with somebody else and they got visited by Homeland
[44:41.480 --> 44:44.720]  Security they didn't just get attacked by Congress they didn't just get demonized
[44:44.720 --> 44:49.440]  in the news and it was over an episode I wrote and I wrote I mean that was the
[44:49.440 --> 44:54.840]  one episode out of scores I was in and I literally 80% of it was me what I would
[44:54.840 --> 44:58.080]  do what I would show what I would go interview I interview this FBI guy
[44:58.080 --> 45:02.200]  interview this person you know to go do this go do that and people are like well
[45:02.200 --> 45:08.720]  don't say this happened to us people are scared yeah I'd say so I just want
[45:08.720 --> 45:13.720]  people to understand this isn't a game and I know you know that but I tell my
[45:13.720 --> 45:17.560]  crew that even though they're great sometimes they go hey you're in a war
[45:17.560 --> 45:22.520]  you're a big deal you're effective you're an important person and you know
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.640]  Matt drudge has told me that he told countless other independent bloggers and
[45:26.640 --> 45:31.440]  journalists you're just as important as the New York Times start thinking like
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.960]  that there's this illusion that even though we're gigantic and reach 20
[45:36.960 --> 45:44.880]  million people a week there's no doubt now worldwide total number of people I'm
[45:44.880 --> 45:49.600]  like three times bigger than Rush Limbaugh in America Rush Limbaugh is
[45:49.600 --> 45:53.800]  still bigger than Alex Jones quite frankly I could care less I don't
[45:53.800 --> 45:57.360]  ever want him to retire I don't ever want him to have a heart attack I wanted
[45:57.360 --> 46:00.320]  to be on the air 30 years from now that's more targets for them to hit
[46:00.320 --> 46:05.720]  they're coming after him first not me probably already are even if I disagree
[46:05.720 --> 46:09.080]  with some of the stuff he says he's a lot better than Hillary Clinton I mean I
[46:09.080 --> 46:12.920]  get the fact that there aren't many people at this level that I met and
[46:12.920 --> 46:18.120]  there's an incredible kinship and incredible solidarity with people I
[46:18.120 --> 46:21.480]  mean I have solidarity with Glenn Beck even though he hates me and attacks me
[46:21.480 --> 46:25.480]  still all the time and says stuff about me that isn't true I still can't help
[46:25.480 --> 46:32.400]  but want him to succeed want him to do great want him to really be successful
[46:32.400 --> 46:39.360]  because we're overall fighting for the same thing I think okay enough him inside
[46:39.360 --> 46:42.320]  baseball it's just that if you want to fight the New World Order spreading the
[46:42.320 --> 46:47.840]  word about this broadcast buying our products is the number one terrestrial
[46:47.840 --> 46:56.280]  thing temporal thing you can do when it comes to blood and guts on the ground
[46:56.280 --> 47:00.000]  boots on the ground this is it and believe me I don't like me in that
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.400]  position it is bracing I wouldn't say frightening but it's like jumping in the
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.040]  cold water I mean it's like when you really see what's going on and then you
[47:09.040 --> 47:14.160]  realize you're in the middle of it it'll get your adrenaline going real quick
[47:14.160 --> 47:17.440]  and then you look at zombies around you you think it's all funny you get mad at
[47:17.440 --> 47:21.400]  them because I mean let me tell you a tyrannical world governments get set up
[47:21.400 --> 47:26.160]  right now being openly announced and it's anti-human and it's anti-prosperity
[47:26.160 --> 47:30.640]  and it wants to dominate you now if you don't take that personal and get your
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.320]  hackles up people always say you know that dog got his hackles up that's when
[47:34.320 --> 47:36.880]  their fur puffs up around their neck because they're about to get in a fight
[47:36.880 --> 47:40.240]  they don't want to get their arteries torn out of their neck when the dog does
[47:40.240 --> 47:43.200]  that it means just getting ready to fight to the death what do you think it is
[47:43.200 --> 47:46.760]  when you get chills that's when we used to have more hair on us folks when I talk
[47:46.760 --> 47:52.120]  about this my hair actually stands up because I'm having a physical response
[47:52.120 --> 47:56.560]  for death battle I realize I'm in the presence of an enemy coming for me and
[47:56.560 --> 48:03.520]  my family I realize all of our histories on the line everything and I can
[48:03.520 --> 48:06.280]  look at Donald Trump and see that he gets chills as well now when he talks
[48:06.280 --> 48:11.480]  about this stuff is he perfect is he worldly is he arrogant certainly but
[48:11.480 --> 48:14.800]  we've been taught to hate men we've been taught to hate confidence we've been
[48:14.800 --> 48:18.200]  taught it's a bad thing because they don't want that in a trait in men they
[48:18.200 --> 48:26.160]  don't want leaders they don't want bravada machismo any type of macho
[48:26.160 --> 48:32.160]  attitude they just want people ready to roll over in a ditch and die and I'm not
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.760]  gonna be part of that I'm not giving up on humanity I'm not giving up on my
[48:36.760 --> 48:42.960]  children I'm not giving up on you and I watch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar say that
[48:42.960 --> 48:47.240]  Trump helps ISIS and quote Trump is the ISIS candidate and Trump is horrible and
[48:47.240 --> 48:52.080]  Trump is racist and Trump is this and Trump is that when Obama's run an
[48:52.080 --> 48:57.480]  operation to kill upwards of 300,000 Libyans Syrians and Egyptians trying to
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.640]  put al-Qaeda and other groups in charge and is bombing these innocent people
[49:01.640 --> 49:07.840]  right now and is bringing in radical Muslims to demonize Muslims in general
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.760]  in a larger plan down the road for a clash of civilizations and Donald Trump
[49:12.760 --> 49:17.040]  saying bomb the oil stop ISIS Turkey's involved he's actually trying to do
[49:17.040 --> 49:22.240]  something he's saying don't let mega banks be tax exempt the Republicans and
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.400]  Democrats won't call for that none of them I started really looking at what
[49:26.400 --> 49:30.280]  Trump's doing other than his red meat rhetoric for the public he's actually
[49:30.280 --> 49:35.560]  lining up policies that the establishment doesn't like and that's why
[49:35.560 --> 49:40.000]  they're coming after Donald Trump and then I see Rick Ross not the real CIA
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  drug dealer Rick Ross as a listener of the show I want to get on and get his
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.960]  response to next week but the fake jail guard that was never a real hardened
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.440]  thug like he likes to act like who likes to get up and prep kids to act like
[49:52.440 --> 49:56.040]  thugs to be put in the big prison complex that he used to work in they
[49:56.040 --> 49:59.040]  admit at MTV I talked to folks that were there in the 90s that they were gonna
[49:59.040 --> 50:04.280]  prep gangster rap to get all the young people into a thug culture to prep you
[50:04.280 --> 50:08.720]  for prison for your future life your future job and that's what Rick Ross is
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.680]  a fake guy with no record who used to sit over black people all day in
[50:13.680 --> 50:20.240]  slave pits and then he gets up with his fake name Rick Ross oh you're so hard
[50:20.240 --> 50:25.200]  stealing somebody's identity and then saying you want to kill Donald Trump and
[50:25.200 --> 50:28.520]  I guarantee he got authorizations from the highest levels of the Justice
[50:28.520 --> 50:33.240]  Department to do that he said I'm gonna kill him I want him dead and all these
[50:33.240 --> 50:36.480]  thousands of tweets saying I'm serious I'm gonna kill Donald Trump and all this
[50:36.480 --> 50:41.680]  crap nobody getting in trouble and to watch all these cowards line up and
[50:41.680 --> 50:45.480]  Lindsey Graham and all of them all getting on the bandwagon because they're
[50:45.480 --> 50:50.800]  followers they're followers they're followers they're not leaders so you
[50:50.800 --> 50:54.480]  gotta admire Trump because he doesn't care what people think about it he is a
[50:54.480 --> 51:01.160]  leader and in a world of cowards a man is something special
[51:01.960 --> 51:07.720]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.720]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[51:11.720 --> 51:14.920]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.160]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[51:19.160 --> 51:23.440]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[51:23.440 --> 51:27.480]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[51:27.480 --> 51:31.960]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[51:31.960 --> 51:35.840]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[51:35.840 --> 51:39.920]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers
[51:39.920 --> 51:44.880]  may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to Fortress

[54:43.480 --> 54:48.680]  3 p.m. now not a brave young Indian Leanne McAdoo remember well we'll be
[54:48.680 --> 54:51.520]  hosting and she'll have a lot of breaking news analysis and info that
[54:51.520 --> 54:56.920]  she's in there working on right now so we have a new Pew study out middle class
[54:56.920 --> 55:02.120]  declining no longer a majority and it's the smallest it's been in really US
[55:02.120 --> 55:06.600]  history and I could go over all that the full story the graphs the reports the
[55:06.600 --> 55:12.320]  numbers it's a Breitbart story it's up on info wars.com you can go see that for
[55:12.320 --> 55:20.240]  yourself but see that's not the news the news is Donald Trump said until we fix
[55:20.240 --> 55:25.280]  the border until we screen these people we got to shut them all off because 25
[55:25.280 --> 55:29.240]  percent in national polls and new polls came out yesterday showing higher
[55:29.240 --> 55:33.800]  numbers and lower numbers 21 percent and 27 percent point is 25 percent on
[55:33.800 --> 55:42.760]  average saying they support suicide bombing. There are polls today showing
[55:42.760 --> 55:48.480]  that quote the people coming out of Syria the so-called refugees 20 plus
[55:48.480 --> 55:52.360]  percent support ISIS or suicide bombing and you know it's higher than that
[55:52.360 --> 55:56.840]  because you asked somebody in a poll do you support suicide bombing oh yes I
[55:56.840 --> 56:01.640]  support suicide bombing I mean you know it's more than the 25 percent and I've
[56:01.640 --> 56:08.760]  got an article right here dealing with it underneath Kareem Abdul-Jabbar saying
[56:08.760 --> 56:14.560]  he's helping ISIS and all the rest of this is Donald Trump's bad report foreign
[56:14.560 --> 56:20.040]  fighters in Iraq and Syria more than double the last 18 months and then it
[56:20.040 --> 56:26.480]  goes into the UN NATO and other zone admissions that's who's coming into the
[56:26.480 --> 56:30.520]  country that's why they're all military aged men and then after a while large
[56:30.520 --> 56:34.120]  portions of these guys are former fighters they decided for fighting a few
[56:34.120 --> 56:39.000]  years they're done and their payoff is going to Europe and raping whoever they
[56:39.000 --> 56:48.880]  want getting free welfare literally. The London Guardian is reporting that number
[56:48.880 --> 56:55.560]  of foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria doubles in a year report fines and folks
[56:55.560 --> 56:59.120]  you can believe it's probably worse than that and then these guys are proud of
[56:59.120 --> 57:02.360]  themselves so they post the photos later on Facebook and then show them in
[57:02.360 --> 57:05.680]  Germany or Sweden or wherever and you talk about the push over domesticated
[57:05.680 --> 57:09.000]  Europeans or Americans I mean unless you're dealing with some good old boy or
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.280]  something they literally fall down in fear to these people and that's what the
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.520]  left says do whatever they say submit to them they'll be nice to us they'll blow
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.960]  stuff up if you don't do what they say you need to be arrested do not say there
[57:20.960 --> 57:28.000]  is any radical Islam I will wear a burqa sexually mutilate me Allah Akbar that is
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.240]  the left's response white flag capitulation let's take conservative
[57:32.240 --> 57:36.440]  speech because you're not submitting to the jihad and you're not letting us
[57:36.440 --> 57:41.080]  teach your five-year-old how to be transsexual you bigots now if you were
[57:41.080 --> 57:45.440]  throwing gay people off a building ISIS or cutting Catholic priest heads off
[57:45.440 --> 57:49.400]  and eating their hearts you'd be a okay and sexy and cool on college campuses
[57:49.400 --> 57:56.300]  but because you're not you're a problem and then you look at it in context Ted
[57:56.300 --> 57:59.840]  Cruz is the only major Republican candidate to not run down Donald Trump
[57:59.840 --> 58:04.000]  now turn against him and I saw something that in a secret fundraiser with rich
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.560]  Republicans he said I might be scared of Donald Trump with his finger on the
[58:07.560 --> 58:14.000]  trigger who knows he even said that the point is Donald Trump is a loose cannon
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.560]  that's what we need is he perfect no do I trust him completely no the difference
[58:19.560 --> 58:23.800]  is the entire elite is against him and they're demonizing every little thing he
[58:23.800 --> 58:27.600]  says out of context in context he said some things I don't like it doesn't
[58:27.600 --> 58:32.320]  matter he's got him scared to death and he's a sign of the establishment in
[58:32.320 --> 58:37.280]  crisis and the coming restoration of our Republic we'll be back with the second
[58:37.280 --> 58:44.440]  hour I'll give the phone number out 800-25-99231 first-time callers 800-25-99231
[58:44.440 --> 58:57.600]  and it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop
[58:57.600 --> 59:02.080]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[59:02.080 --> 59:06.520]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind control television music
[59:06.520 --> 59:11.200]  fast food GMOs sugars you name it young humans have not yet developed their
[59:11.200 --> 59:15.840]  nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions it's no
[59:15.840 --> 59:19.440]  wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous
[59:19.440 --> 59:23.640]  psychotropic drugs working with my team we set out to find the best formula with
[59:23.640 --> 59:27.120]  the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take we
[59:27.120 --> 59:30.520]  worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe
[59:30.520 --> 59:34.040]  for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula
[59:34.040 --> 59:38.920]  out there introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile
[59:38.920 --> 59:43.640]  and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great obtain your child ease
[59:43.640 --> 59:48.640]  today and info wars life dot com that's child ease exclusively an info wars life
[59:48.640 --> 59:56.960]  dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:56.960 --> 01:00:11.120]  you are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the GCN radio
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:21.320]  network and I recognize that a great many folks in the media would would
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:28.000]  prefer that that anyone running for president engage in an ongoing as an
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.440]  ongoing theater critic criticizing the proposals of others I do not agree with
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.840]  his proposal I do not think it is the right solution and the right solution I
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.360]  believe is the legislation that I've introduced legislation that would impose
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:48.920]  a three-year moratorium on the refugees coming from countries where ISIS or
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.760]  al-qaeda control a substantial amount of territory this is legislation that is
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:00.800]  targeted directly to the problem and the reason is simple we had been told by the
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.200]  FBI they cannot vet these refugees the second piece of legislation governor
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.080]  Abbott mentioned is legislation that I filed today that will protect the
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:14.440]  authority of the states and the authority of governors to keep their
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.440]  citizens safe and it would say that in the event the president wants to send
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:25.120]  refugees to a particular state that a governor has the ability to opt out to
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.400]  conclude that the federal government has not done a sufficient job ensuring
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.520]  that the safety and security of the citizens of the state will be protected
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.400]  and then the third piece of legislation that I have tried to bring up in recent
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.840]  weeks and the democrats have blocked is the expatriate terrorist act which
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.760]  provides that if an American goes and travels abroad and joins ISIS and takes
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.200]  up arms and wages jihad against the United States that he or she forfeits
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.800]  their US citizenship that's a good idea all of these are reasonable common sense
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:03.480]  steps yep to keep America safe at senator Ted Cruz very presidential I
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.880]  mean he probably is the smartest of all the candidates on the Republican side
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:10.640]  other than Trump when it comes to business and Trump knows people like
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.880]  stuff said kind of at a street level Trump says it's what he's got street
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.440]  smarts Cruz is very statesmanly very cerebral and what he's saying is an
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.960]  accurate basic plan I mean it's the bare minimum you should do when 25% of the
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:32.840]  people in a poll say that they support suicide bombers or they support ISIS
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.520]  that's because they admit between 75 and 80 plus percent depending on which
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:44.920]  numbers come out from Interpol the EU you name it are not Syrians they came to
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:52.880]  take over land just like the Saudi Arabians did one time before they came
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.840]  in and took over Syria and got kicked back out there's a movie about it it's
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:03.560]  called Lawrence of Arabia and it's not their country and they're they're
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:08.680]  taking it they never had any history up there they have no reason to be there
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.240]  they're there and then now they're gonna come here and they are
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.920]  incompatible to live anywhere I mean Saudi Arabia is a freak zone of craziness
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.040]  from all the military and family I've talked to that have worked for different
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.080]  companies been over there I mean they catch you with the Bible on the street
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.120]  folks you're gonna be in prison for life lucky they don't chop your head off and
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:33.080]  all they do is peck at each other to make the others more radical that's what
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.280]  cults do they just get more and more extreme more and more whacked out more
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:42.320]  and more weird and I for one am completely sick of it I do not have
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:50.320]  Islamophobia I have Wahhabist Saudi Arabia phobia I have cult phobia and
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.600]  who's the other group acts like a cult that I can see that I am just as
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.320]  disgusted by because they are so freakish they are so weird and they're
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:06.200]  teamed up with the jihadis with the Wahhabist jihadis and that is the
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:13.000]  politically correct left that you cannot make up how serious their war on
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  words their war on logic their war on discussion their war on free speech their
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.080]  war on creativity their war on beauty their war on arithmetic their war on
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.120]  literature their war on culture their their their war on common sense their
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:34.400]  war on logic their war on beauty their war on men their war on women their war
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:40.880]  on basic human systems students at Pennsylvania College want Lynch Hall
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.320]  renamed because of the word Lynch I'm gonna cover this and take your phone
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:52.240]  calls when we come back folks they know exactly what they're doing when they say
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:58.960]  banned the Irish word Lynch that has nothing to do with hanging black people
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.800]  Hillary Clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her she was recently
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.160]  trying to censor comedy skits that poked fun at her which were produced by the

[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:09.000]  Roger Stone advisor to nine presidents and who's been involved in elections here
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.680]  and all over the world and one of Trump's top advisors joining us for an
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.520]  hour and a half to talk all things planet Trump and election 2016 then
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:26.280]  Leigh Ann McAdoo will be hosting the fourth hour today now we've had Karim
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:31.440]  Abdul-Jabbar we've had senator Lindsey Graham we've had countless other
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.400]  Republican candidates Jeb Bush people like Rick Ross the fake Rick Ross come
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.040]  out and well Rick Ross had killed Donald Trump says he wants him to be murdered
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.240]  and Karim Abdul-Jabbar claims that he's helping ISIS he's the ISIS candidate
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.560]  when he actually called for bombing their oil that they're trying to sell and
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.840]  actually agreed with Putin and others something the other candidates didn't do
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:01.480]  so Donald Trump is right on about like I said about 95% of his views and topics
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.920]  I disagree with him on a few things like the internet and you know restricting
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.840]  it so ISIS doesn't get it you just can't do that so there are some problems
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.280]  with Trump but compared to a Hillary Clinton or compared to a Lindsey Graham
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:21.560]  or compared to a you know socialist senator from Connecticut it is complete
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:28.640]  and total absolute night and day and before we go to the calls though the
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.760]  problem we're dealing with as the Pew research shows the middle class is
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:38.440]  disappearing at the fastest rate ever the workforce is set to shrink to million
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:43.280]  people the Congressional Budget Office is saying just from the first year of
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.160]  full implementation of Obamacare we're only 21 days out from that nightmare the
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.600]  fines all the rest of it Morgan Stanley begins layoffs and credit division
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.120]  while all this is going on the FBI admits they're not vetting any of these
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.840]  refugees a large portion admit they want to be terrorist they're attacking
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.200]  Europe on a basically weekly basis we're getting attacked they try to say all
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.320]  these attacks aren't attacks whether it's Fort Hood or what happened last
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:17.320]  Wednesday eight days ago and in the midst of this though they want Thomas
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.000]  Jefferson statues taken down all over the country because he tried to ban
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.040]  slavery in the Declaration of Independence but it was removed that's
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.120]  how ignorant they are they go but but he had slaves that he was trying to
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:36.760]  change the law to free the time he was in it's like it's like saying Schindler
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.400]  went along with the Nazis yeah as he tried to save Jews he had to or they
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.840]  kill him right there on the spot I mean there's just no understanding of the
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:50.360]  time people are in but you see things like Seattle where the official city not
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:57.640]  some idiot students but the official city says don't bring brown bags to any
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:03.080]  city function and don't say that a city function brown bag it because brown
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:06.640]  saying the word brown might hurt somebody's feeling or seeing brown now
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.040]  they admit it no one ever claimed it was racist no no they they have to attach
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:16.040]  racial meaning or religious bigotry or something in fighting to all words in
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.760]  all language so when they want to they can selectively demonize your speech
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:27.920]  and disqualify it's a war on words you know George Arwell said Eric Blair
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.520]  writer for the BBC propagandists for British intelligence Winston Smith is
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.600]  an allegory of himself he admitted that before he died he died a year after he
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:45.400]  published 1984 but 1949 it's 1948 reverse ladies and gentlemen of what it
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.640]  would be of the Fabian socialist liberals took over what the world would
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.800]  look like and you notice it's looking more and more like that because he was
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:59.160]  in there amongst them and he wrote essays admitting it he didn't like radical
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.960]  right-wingers he'd been a leftist this whole life fought in the Spanish Civil
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.880]  War then a member of the secret police before that in India that's what made
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:16.200]  him a leftist was the abuse of Indians in India but but I digress he said the
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.360]  the goal will be by the Fabian socialist to reduce language down to such a
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.040]  level that you cannot communicate with someone and hasn't even understand how
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.000]  they've been lied to and they'll have double think where they hold two
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.600]  opposite thoughts in their mind at the same time and believe each one as valid
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:36.960]  as the other that's what they're indoctrinating us with is like this
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:44.720]  mental illness this this mass Stockholm syndrome and so sitting back looking at
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:53.000]  all of this they have to expand it out always more and more so the real racism
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.120]  of targeting blacks with Planned Parenthood isn't looked at or targeting
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.760]  Hispanics with Gardasil shots isn't looked at no no you just got to then say
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.600]  well if you don't have totally open borders and pay for everything free
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.440]  you're a racist or if Donald Trump goes to a Jewish group and says you know
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.520]  Jews are really known for being smart hard-working folks it's good to be here
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.080]  with such good people oh it's racist to attribute something to a racial or
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.080]  religious group no everybody said look at the Japanese crime went down during
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.840]  the tsunami and during the earthquakes when things got tough almost no crime
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:32.200]  wow what amazing people that's not anti-Japanese see they're attacking
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.880]  your ability to discriminate see some discrimination is obviously wrong if
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.120]  it's based on on real issues but if it's based on I've been to that restaurant
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.840]  twice and got food poisoning both times it's not racist or discriminatory or
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.040]  whatever to discriminate and say I like the hamburgers at that place I like
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.400]  this ketchup I like this brand of car I like women that look like this and act
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.080]  like this it's what you like they're saying you can't have your own opinions
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.760]  or be a free conscious individual that is cult like isn't it by design so now
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:11.000]  students at Pennsylvania School want Lynch Hall this is associated press this
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.040]  isn't in full wars.com students at Pennsylvania School want Lynch Hall
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:24.120]  renamed because the word Lynch now I went and looked it up Lynch means
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:30.680]  Mariner or water in the Irish Gaelic and it basically means the same thing in
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.320]  the Nordic Lynch there's also a Nordic Lynch because all the groups are really
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.720]  related to each other which shows how stupid it is the British Empire could
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.480]  play different groups off against each other it's totally moronic but another
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:46.400]  side issue divide and conquer they call it the great game this is from
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:55.600]  ancestry.com Irish Lynch anglicized from Gaelic long ashine a personal name
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:04.240]  meaning Mariner from longship or Viking basically okay men in long boats let's
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:14.680]  continue that settled Ireland the etymology this is from encyclopedia the
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.000]  origins of the word Lynch are obscure but likely originate from the American
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.560]  Revolution the term originates from the phrase Lynch law passed to stop people
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.280]  lynching punishment without trial so see the word Lynch is good meaning stop
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.760]  doing it two Americans during this era are generally credit with the phrase
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.440]  Charles Lynch and William Lynch both lived in Virginia in the 1918 1780s
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.200]  trying to go too fast here go and go to calls them I'm gonna slow down and cover
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:46.840]  this Charles Lynch and then it just goes over the fact that it was a case of
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:53.160]  lynching and by the way none of a black person but this is how emotional it is
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:17:00.200]  you hear a Nordic or an Irish Gaelic name that means Mariner or boatman and
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:04.520]  then you want it banned because all you know is the word Lynch is associated
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.560]  with hanging black people when really it was two white men hanging a member of
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:15.480]  their family who were named Lynch but see for them it's a power thing to take
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:22.760]  language away to take people's rights away to have a name to demand history be
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:30.000]  overwritten this is the essence of 1984 changing history I mean so what if it
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.840]  was a racist weirdo that found in your college you run it now it's run by your
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:37.480]  people it's a building it's a colony it's a system it's where you're supposed
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.280]  to learn you learn how to end fight not not how to get a job not how to be
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:47.360]  normal it'd be like saying of a moray eel had lived in a hole in coral 20 years
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:52.800]  before and now a grouper lives in it does the grouper say moray eels eat baby
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:57.680]  groupers so this was a racist hole so I'm not gonna live in this a moray eels
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.840]  hole because he doesn't even care that a moray eel lived there 20 years before he
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:08.240]  doesn't even know it it's a good hole oh change it but it wasn't a racist it
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.720]  wasn't named after a lynch mom it had was named over somebody named Lynch and
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:16.120]  they say well the word Lynch could draw up frightening connotations we're scared
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.640]  by the word so get rid of it I mean you talk about idiots instead of the fun if
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.300]  if somebody said this of going and looking it up oh it means boatman it means
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:30.280]  sailor it means it's somebody in a Navy
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:34.080]  students at a small Pennsylvania College are demanding that they're doing a
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.720]  walkout and laying on the sidewalk the administrators rename a building called
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:43.000]  Lynch Memorial Hall because of the racial overturns of the word Lynch oh
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.480]  there's overtones and brown bag to the building is named it required a Lynch
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:54.600]  who was president of Lebanon Valley College until 1950 and they said they
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:19:01.400]  want it renamed after his first name and middle initial because the word recalls
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:07.920]  the public executions of black men by white mobs in the 18 and 1900s it was
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:10.400]  included on a list of demands that students presented at the school on
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:15.520]  Friday I mean you talk about a group of ignorant morons and by the way if any
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.480]  of their professors dare educate them and say hey it's an Irish name it's a
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:25.120]  Nordic name it has nothing to do with any of this it means sailor this guy is
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:29.640]  just Irish you know he helped get this building built he gave the money for it
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:34.720]  so you can be in it they just go now with the Lynch word scares us we want it
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:42.640]  banned think about that these people aren't able to get jobs or have a life
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:47.000]  they're gonna be gibbering mentally ill people when they come out of college the
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  ones that buy into this they just know how to just see shadows and phantoms
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.360]  everywhere while their basic freedoms are being removed collectively regardless
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.240]  of race color creed religion against them all still wondering what to get that
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.840]  special someone that has everything at ID stronghold we still find that a huge
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:10.200]  percentage of people do not yet have an RFID blocking wallet or purse to protect
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.840]  them from the new and growing threat of electronic thick pocketing that's right
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.600]  even though 40% of all new chipped payment card shipped in 2014 contain a

[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.960]  think you are that's the new talking point by the Republicans the Democrats
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:44.920]  all of Hillary Clinton that creature Lindsey Graham John McCain they're all
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.720]  out there saying that Donald Trump is helping ISIS and then giving no
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.240]  intellectual facts no Donald Trump's trying to keep ISIS out of this country
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:58.920]  and when there's a more terror attacks and Donald Trump points out it's another
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:04.840]  person got in got into this country on a phony visa with phony info will he get
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.400]  rewarded with people support probably not because the ones that already
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.720]  supporting know what's going on the ones that don't they don't care how much
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.320]  evidence there is how much common sense there is they're the kind of people that
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:22.720]  want to change the name of Lynch Hall at a college because the last guy's name is
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.920]  Lynch and they associate that with someone being hung or killed extra
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:33.360]  judicially meanwhile Obama wants to lynch all gun owners extra judicially I
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.240]  just thought of that I use fancy terms like extra judicial banning your flight
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.960]  banning your guns banning your travel the blood of tyranny the oxygen of
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:50.840]  tyranny the atmosphere on which its wings flap and oh we're gonna just put
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.360]  you on a fly list for no reason and then you can't have a gun a no-gun list a
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:00.120]  lynch mob on the Second Amendment that's what it is an extra judicial magic
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.040]  lynch mob in the unelected government like the NDAA says they'll grab you
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.120]  they'll interrogate you they'll torture you they'll kill you even US citizens
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.080]  and you don't have a right to even tell your family they have you before they
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:18.520]  tell you and they can use torture against you a classic torture lynch mob
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.320]  but because there's a real lynching going on no one seems to care because the
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:28.800]  word is so scary from the name it comes from in the name of the law
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:36.120]  ignorance on top of ignorance on top of moronic idiocy but you talk to these
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.080]  university students I guarantee you they'll get all mad and go trigger trigger
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.720]  get back you're being aggressive you're being hateful get back get back I ran
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.360]  into some weirdo lady at Target I hardly ever got a big box to her but I was
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:53.280]  going there and my son like some of the sweaters they've got there and they're

[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.440]  but man I tell you once I did more research on him advisor to nine
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:49.440]  presidents and one of Donald Trump's chief advisors straight ahead we're on
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:57.600]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.680]  I'm a proud Muslim but you don't have to share my faith to share my disgust that
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:08.440]  was written by Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman Huma Abedin who pinned
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:12.200]  the email in response to Donald Trump's recent proposition to impose a complete
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:15.680]  and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States you know it was the
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.240]  FBI director the head of counterterrorism and Homeland Security who all said
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.360]  under oath that they cannot properly vet people coming in from Syria but let's
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:27.960]  take a look at Ms. Abedin back in 2012 five Republicans sent a letter to the
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.360]  Department of Homeland Security noting that three of her family members had
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:35.280]  very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood she was also intimately involved
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.360]  in Hillary Clinton's email scandal and while she was at the State Department
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.200]  Ms. Abedin helped our country cozy up to a chic Yusuf al-Qaeda a promoter of
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.440]  jihadist terror and one of her many accomplishments while at the State
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.640]  Department was helping destroy the country of Libya I'm sure her and her
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:53.120]  Muslim Brotherhood friends are very proud of that achievement just imagine
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.360]  what she can do in her best pal Hillary Clinton gets into the White House

[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.440]  so a university in pennsylvania the associated press is reporting with a
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:29.520]  straight face the students have walked out they are doing these die-ins where
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:39.760]  they lay on the ground until the library hall at lebanon valley college removes
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:45.600]  the name lynch memorial hall not because the guy was involved in lynching
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:50.840]  anybody not because lynch is an irish name not because it means boatman or
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:56.880]  mariner or seaman no because they're scared of the word lynch and then day
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.240]  and night just walked in during the break it was alex who else is named
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:05.080]  lynch in the administration and i went the attorney general i hadn't even
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:10.320]  thought of that how rich is that that obama wants to extra judicially lynch
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.280]  the second amendment and put you on a no-gun buy list on this phantom terror
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:18.600]  database when they actually won't scream the people coming in who are
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:25.040]  terrorist and then the attorney general is named loretta lynch then we should
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:31.080]  call for her to change her name i feel threatened i feel upset by it maybe ap
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.560]  should write a real article about that alex jones maybe we should start a
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.080]  white house petition get thousands to sign it to the attorney general change
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:45.400]  her name or just be loretta l because it scares me they want the study hall to

[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.360]  last week info wars uh had donald trump on the broadcast
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:08.840]  and donald trump called him a patriot in a tough cookie uh and here is what
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:13.720]  others have had to say roger stones next book jeb and the bush crime family
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:17.400]  rips the veil off the whitewash that has protected the bush crime
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.080]  syndicate uh it's a story of privilege elitism oil money
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:25.320]  assassination sex ambition corruption and power and i'll tell you if you can
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.280]  find his book on a few online sites and you

[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.640]  sold out i've tried to buy 5000 from skyhorse
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:39.800]  we have sold his books before it's like wait i know this guy i've read his books
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:43.400]  wait it's like wow once he was in studio with us because i knew he was but not
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.760]  how prominent he was and how much he'd been involved in
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.760]  so he'll definitely be a staple of the show from now on because on elections on
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:54.360]  third world on uh presidents uh you know on
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.400]  reagan i mean he knows so much about these guys he worked for
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.800]  uh but what's exciting is he's known trump for 30 something years
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:05.560]  and again uh was his exploratory uh head
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.920]  when he was thinking about running four or five years ago and so he can really
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:12.680]  tell you about donald trump and what really makes donald trump tick
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:16.760]  and all these big scandals that are happening and the rest of it but
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:20.120]  yes if you can get the clinton's war on women
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:24.440]  it is a hot book sold out many places and we're trying to get an emergency
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.840]  printing done right now so we get more before christmas but
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.280]  but that is the bottom line
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:38.680]  now continuing ladies and gentlemen uh with this info i could sit here all
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:42.280]  day and bring up questions and comments for mr stone
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.760]  whether he wants to get into the book first whether he wants to get into the
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:48.040]  interview last week uh with trump that he helped set up
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:51.960]  uh and the inside baseball there or whether he wants to dive them the
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:55.400]  current attacks on trump let's let him decide
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:59.000]  what we get into first uh mr stone thanks for coming on with us
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.080]  alex thanks once again for having me you bet where do you want to go first
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:09.160]  let's talk about uh the media savagery of donald j trump i must tell you not
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.760]  since i saw richard nixon my mentor the man who gave me my start in politics
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:19.240]  under siege in 1974 while the mass media went out of their way to try to
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:24.040]  destroy him and drive him from public life have i seen an onslaught like this
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:30.120]  donald trump proposed a temporary ban on immigrants from muslim
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.800]  from muslim countries until such time as us
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.280]  representatives could get a handle on who who wanted to come here
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:42.120]  and the national media as you know has completely bastardized that
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:46.920]  they have truncated his comments to make it appear that he called for a permanent
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:52.200]  ban of all muslims for all time and then they launched themselves in this long
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:56.680]  discussion of whether that would be unconstitutional when in fact
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.120]  that's not what trump proposed at all he put forward
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.280]  a common sense proposal which the president united states clearly has the
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:11.000]  authority to do to freeze muslim immigration temporarily
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.200]  until we can set up some kind of screening process
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.200]  to vet those who would like to come here
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.120]  and that is what he said they took it out of context to just say ban all
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.920]  muslims and now they have all these people saying kill him rick ross says he
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:28.680]  wants to murder him uh the fake rick ross rapper uh it's the
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:34.680]  cause celeb thing to do to pile on lindsay graham hillary clinton saying he is helping isis
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.360]  when he's doing exactly what russia is doing to take out isis
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:42.040]  before russia even bombed their oil they're selling that they've stolen
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.480]  he said do that i mean he's been proven right on so many fronts
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:49.720]  yeah you know what this is of course is part and parcel the fact that he scares
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:56.120]  the political class to death the lobbyists the consultant class
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.280]  the special interests the billionaires paul singer
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:03.880]  the coke brothers uh uh steve schwarzman
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.040]  and others uh because you would not have business as usual
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:11.640]  in washington if trump became president good god
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:15.480]  a president who actually worked for the american people who couldn't be
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.960]  bought and sold um the other thing i found really laughable yesterday alex
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:23.960]  was charged by jeb bush of all people
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:27.880]  that trump was in league with bill and hillary clinton
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.240]  uh that is i can tell you having known trump
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:35.640]  for almost 40 years that is laughable he is one of the most
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:40.520]  competitive people in the country he is running for president because he
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:45.640]  wants to save this country donald trump would never be a straw man for someone
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:50.520]  else anyone else uh and frankly he's the only guy in the
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:55.160]  country the only guy in this race who has legal standing
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:59.240]  to bring a lawsuit against the clinton foundation because they defrauded him
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:02.920]  he made a modest contribution thinking he was giving to charity
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.200]  he now learns that he's given to a slush fund
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.680]  for grifters trump now has the power through lawsuit
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:14.760]  to unravel the entire mess at the clinton foundation
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:18.200]  which is a slush fund for grifters which is
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:23.080]  set up as you know uh as a vehicle for the facilitation
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.400]  of multi-million-dollar bribes so trump poses
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.960]  an enormous threat to the clinton's an enormous threat to the status quo in
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:35.160]  washington a threat to the political and
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.840]  ruling elites good god if this man became president he could
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.320]  undercover he could uncover all of the government's
[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.440]  well look at how he says when no other candidate's saying this
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:47.480]  that he wants to get rid of the tax exemption for these big heads funds and
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:50.040]  megabanks and make them pay a modest amount
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:52.760]  i mean that would literally fix so many of our problems
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.960]  i mean those are the big globalist companies like goldman sacks that
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:59.560]  that that run the anti-gun agenda that run the open border agenda
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:03.800]  they're the ones almost every time literally captaining
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:08.040]  this whole takedown and trump's going after them he's actually going after
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.440]  the crony element of wall street that is unprecedented
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:16.760]  the brass balls that that takes in the irony of course is that trump knows all
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.640]  these people he socializes them they're desperate to
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:23.000]  get into his club in palm beach the marlago club which is
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.680]  the most exclusive and sought after private club in florida
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.680]  but i might also add one of the few private clubs in palm beach
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:34.680]  that admits jews and hispanics and african americans
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:41.400]  so uh it is um it is uh almost laughable to see the panic at the at the
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:46.440]  political elite level and that's why this unprecedented smear against trump
[01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:50.840]  the irony of this of course is that it's having the exact reverse
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:55.000]  effect in my opinion meaning the more the elites
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.920]  attack trump the more the talking heads on cnn
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:04.360]  rip him uh uh the more the rights prebuses of the republican national
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:08.760]  committee come forward and denounce him the stronger he gets because it is a
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:13.960]  signal to average people that this guy must threaten the status quo
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.520]  that he is a real harbinger of change so um yesterday
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:23.080]  there was a bloomberg survey which showed that two thirds of republican
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:27.400]  primary voters agreed with trump when they were asked the
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.840]  narrow and fair question of whether they wanted a
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:36.200]  temporary halt in muslim immigration of course that's not what the
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:39.160]  mainstream media would have you believe he proposed but
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:45.720]  it there is overwhelming support for trump's position uh and uh i think that
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:51.400]  this also reflects a reuters poll that was done uh on a daily
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:55.560]  tracking basis while they didn't ask the precise question about trump's
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:59.240]  proposal they did look at republican primary
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:03.000]  voter attitudes towards uh muslims and the muslim
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.840]  community and they see the possibility of danger
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.080]  they realize that of all these hundreds of thousands of
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.920]  of uh of uh immigrants who would like to come to this country
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:17.640]  while i'm sure that many many of them are decent
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:22.440]  peace-loving people americans aren't stupid they know that there's a terrorist
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:26.840]  contingent in there of course this is a this is a zone syria
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.280]  where hundreds of thousands of jihadi's invaded they've gotten their butts handed
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:33.720]  to them so now they're getting into turkey in europe and come to the us
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.920]  there's a good percentage of them and we got polls he cited them
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:41.160]  21 percent 25 percent 27 percent we showed those last hour on screen we'll
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:44.760]  show them again saying they support jihad and suicide bombers
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.120]  and they've got fake passports most of them they're not even syria
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:52.280]  we would be insane to continue this so so what is the government thinking
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:56.200]  bringing them in knowing they're going to blow stuff up and shoot people
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:59.960]  yeah it's really extraordinary of course we had the lesson of paris where
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:04.760]  a terrorist moves seamlessly through that nation's immigrant process
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:10.040]  to mastermind the mass killings last week i i don't know how uh use trump's
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.240]  words how stupid can the american people be i must tell you
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.760]  i'm very comfortable about an election that is framed
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:20.040]  around these issues i am very comfortable
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.400]  comparing trump's proposal with hillary clinton's
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:27.640]  record on middle eastern issues and of course our closest record of giving
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:31.240]  stinger missiles to al-qaeda you mean that record well the record of of
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:34.360]  arming isis because she's the one who armed them
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:39.800]  in her fury to try to depose qaddafi and insert a regime that is loyal and now
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.360]  she says trump's helping isis you talk about upending reality
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:48.360]  yeah it's kafka ask uh it's it's typical big media
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.200]  big government doublespeak where they say the exact opposite
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:56.200]  of what is true the good news is the american people are waking up
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.760]  they're they're not buying this line anymore in my opinion only trump
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:04.920]  would put forward a a an aggressive strategy to crush isis
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:10.600]  this pinprick approach that barack obama says he's utilizing clearly is not
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.520]  working at all and then uh you know i am kind of uh
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.960]  interested because the other day whom a biden
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:22.920]  also known as mrs carlos danger the top aide to hillary clinton also known as
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.000]  mrs hillary your mrs hillary clinton yeah perhaps
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.520]  but who i mean i'm not hillary which one is the missus i'm sorry it is hard to
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.160]  it is hard to say isn't it yes uh but look
[01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:39.000]  huma is beautiful she's exotic uh she's very chicly dressed good for hillary
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.760]  yeah and she's completely loyal to the muslim brotherhood
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:46.280]  her parents and her brothers are very active in the muslim brotherhood
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.400]  she has written for a muslim brotherhood funded publication for many years
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:54.840]  her loyalty is not to the united states so one must ask
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.200]  how does she get a security clearance from the u.s. state department
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:02.680]  or maybe she never had a security clearance maybe that's why hillary had
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:08.200]  to use an outside server so that huma could look at
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:11.160]  all those classified documents and then decide
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:15.640]  what we should be allowed to see and what we shouldn't be allowed to try
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:19.000]  i mean i have must tell you i spent uh many years in government
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.920]  as an eight to three presidents and i never saw a situation in which
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.720]  an individual got a special waiver that allowed her to get a full-time
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.960]  salary at the state department at the same time she's pulling down a second
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:36.360]  paycheck from tineo which is a clinton connected lobbying
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:41.000]  organization which has clients that lobby the state department
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.880]  at the third time same time whom is pulling down
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:47.480]  yet a third paycheck from the clinton foundation
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.720]  now we know that the clinton foundation and the state department
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:57.000]  uh had business in the sense that many corporations many foreign nations
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.320]  many wealthy people realized if you had a big decision at state department that
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.320]  meant millions of dollars to your pocket you could buy american decision
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.320]  making by giving enormous contributions to the clinton foundation
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.640]  so uh it really is a vehicle for the facilitation these multi-million
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:18.040]  dollar bribes huma abedin was right in the middle of that and of
[01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:20.840]  course last week uh or i should say earlier this week
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:25.080]  huma abedin was among those denouncing donald j trump
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:29.000]  what could be a greater badge of honor than to be attacked by well she tried to
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.960]  imply he wanted to throw her out i mean maybe she should be thrown out but
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:35.000]  after her loyalties are investigated i mean i'm sick
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.200]  of the arrogance of all these foreigners and people that just think america is
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:41.000]  this big doormat and that we're here to be culled
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.320]  and and and culled into submission but beginning back to donald trump himself
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:50.120]  six months ago when this stuff first started i wasn't sure i did more research
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:54.040]  uh and then i saw where he was with so many policies i saw how they demonized
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:57.640]  him i saw how the big money came out against him
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.640]  i saw the republican leadership line up against him all that was a better sign
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.880]  that he really was for real now i've seen him come out against the big banks
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:09.320]  being tax exempt i've seen him come out unequivocally for the second
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.040]  amendment i've seen him come out for you know blowing up the isis oil fields
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:17.240]  all this stuff is the opposite of what the establishment wants
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:20.440]  he clearly knows what he's talking about and then he talks about how our
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.920]  borders are gone we're being brought into globalism
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:26.600]  we're being shut down we're being dismantled and i'm just not hearing this
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.800]  out of anybody but ten crews and a little bit out of rand paul and i've
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:32.600]  supported you know both of them i'd be happy with any three of those guys being
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.680]  president but then i just love the fact that
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:39.960]  he calls out the media he's already started a revolution
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:43.880]  in the debates where where they all laugh at the moderators
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:47.880]  who are basically political pundits and i see the whole facade
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.720]  the force field around the globalist almost dissolving
[01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:56.840]  with just donald trump being a candidate it's like it's it's
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:01.000]  like he's anti-matter to these people and it really excites me
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.080]  and the fact that he's not a coward the fact that he is the man in the arena
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.760]  the fact that he doesn't back down is so exciting
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:12.040]  and that's what we need again is someone who is an individual
[01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:15.800]  someone who doesn't come from some weirdo leftist cult
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:19.720]  or some neocon cult or some you know weird group
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:24.200]  we need somebody who really does want to turn this country loose to do great
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.880]  things and i'm sold that donald trump's for real
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:31.800]  i'm sold he really wants to cut taxes and bring back our sovereignty and kick
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:35.160]  criminals out of the nation and do all those things
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:38.440]  i just asked myself though when he does shoot for the
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.760]  from the hip he is teleprompter free he is talking point free
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:46.920]  what's brought him to this prominence could also be taken out of context to
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:51.880]  bring him down but but maybe that is a sign that the public
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:56.040]  has so much broken with the establishment uh that they
[01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:59.720]  don't care what they do to him they're going to continue to support him
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:02.920]  hey i want you to speak to that as a top presidential advisor
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.160]  a guy that's run major campaigns around the world
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:08.520]  roger stone our guest and then specifically
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.000]  what are the dirty tricks they're going to pull
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.760]  what is the mathematical electorate constellation
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.280]  that tells you he is electable in a general election
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:24.840]  roger stone well let's tackle this one by one first of all i have no question
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:27.640]  that he is the strongest possible candidate
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:31.240]  against hillary clinton even some of the preliminary polls and i don't mean
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:35.640]  online polls where you can vote and then push refresh and vote again and then
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:39.480]  vote and push refresh and vote again i'm talking about scientific
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:43.240]  based polls with an accurate and carefully balanced
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:47.080]  perfectly drawn sample show that trump is already pulling
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:50.920]  unprecedented levels of blacks catholics
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:55.080]  and union members individual rank and file ruin union members
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:58.760]  i believe that he could draw literally millions of people
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:02.520]  into the electoral process who have given up on politics are you talking
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.040]  about reagan democrats and people well i think it's even beyond that i think
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:09.000]  it's beyond reagan democrats yes i think he can get those
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:14.280]  blue collar ethnic democrats those working class democrats who are as sick
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:18.680]  of the elitism and the big government and the big spending and the big taxing
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:21.480]  policies and the low employment policies of
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:25.560]  washington but beyond that i think there are millions of people who like you and
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:30.680]  i alex realize that both parties have morphed into one party
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:35.000]  that the choice that is presented to the voters like the choice between romney
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.800]  and obama is a false choice that the two parties are the same the parties of
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:44.920]  endless war erosion of our civil liberties massive debt
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:50.680]  unhinge spending uh the list goes on and on so i think there are
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:54.120]  millions of americans for whom trump
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:59.320]  uh it looks like something different a real reformer i think he can pull those
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:04.840]  people back into the political process and that is why he is the strongest
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:09.560]  potential republican candidate it aggravates me that people keep asking
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:13.080]  him well are you going to run as an independent
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:17.080]  he's the frontrunner for the republican nomination not by a little bit by a lot
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:21.160]  by 10 points why would he even consider it we'll all do respect
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.680]  go ask ran paul that question he's running he's running laps
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:29.160]  his father once bolted the gop to run as an independent maybe it's a more
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:33.080]  appropriate question for senator paul at this point i want to be clear i don't
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:37.480]  want to run senator ran paul down but i'm an honest person
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:41.000]  and i knew him 20 years ago back when he campaigned for his dad
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.240]  when his district came into austin um i've supported him but nice to him his
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:48.760]  dad comes on total integrity love the paul's
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:52.600]  but the way ran gets advised now the things he does
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:58.520]  um i mean you notice ted cruz is smart and isn't attacking trump i just don't
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:02.680]  get it and i really wanted ran to be more aggressive like a trump
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:08.280]  uh and it's just it's just very sad yeah now look i share your high regard for
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:13.160]  both ran paul and his father the very last vote i cast as a republican
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:17.720]  was for ron paul and the florida primary uh against met romney
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:22.120]  uh and i'm an admirer ran paul although i i think he seems to have lost his
[01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:26.360]  berries here i mean i'm not sure who he is you can't be all things to all men
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:29.320]  you can't be both a libertarian and a traditional
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:33.240]  conservative uh and then try to trim your foreign policy to show that you
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:38.040]  really are a statist i i just think his candidacy uh has failed and sadly i
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:40.920]  think it is over but the personal attacks on
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:45.000]  donald trump those i can't figure out they have golfed together i happen to
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.280]  know that donald trump likes senator paul and says by the way
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.320]  he's an exceptional golfer so um it is probably why trump's been snapping back
[01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:57.080]  at him because they were friends and then paul makes crappy comments about
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:59.960]  well one thing i can tell you about trump having spent an enormous amount of
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.800]  time with him if you punch trump you better be prepared to get punched back
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:08.200]  at twice the velocity it's it's just his nature do not
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:11.720]  do not awaken the sleeping beast if you attack donald trump
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:15.560]  you better expect incoming and it'll be almost immediate
[01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.560]  well moving on from senator paul it's a sad story uh just kind of let the
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:23.720]  dead berry the dead politically at this point unless he wakes up with those
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:27.000]  snot nose young republicans he's got around him up there in his campaign i
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.040]  don't mean to be mean but that's just i mean you're talking about the tail
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:32.920]  wagging the dog here i'm just gonna say it and move on
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:37.400]  um but how do we get behind trump how do we stop the dirty
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.920]  tricks how do we get him into the presidency because nothing makes me like
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:43.800]  him more i mean i'm moving towards a hundred percent mark now
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.160]  with all these wolves attacking and all these cowards piling on
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:51.080]  the one man in the arena uh i mean that's you're talking my language right
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:54.280]  there well let me just predict right now that
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:59.480]  the next major attack on trump uh will will be a bogus claim
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:04.280]  that he is somehow mobbed up i can or there's a half dozen news organizations
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:08.600]  who've been working on this for months now what they don't seem to know
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:13.960]  is that uh that trump has for over 15 years held a new jersey casino control
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:19.720]  operators license the new jersey uh casino control law is the most
[01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:25.080]  stringent law in the country in other words you can be denied a license
[01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.280]  just having met a mobster you don't have to do business with them you don't have
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.920]  to trade money with them you have to buy anything from them
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.720]  just a social occasion in which you are together can be enough to deny you a
[01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:41.240]  license they are very very very sensitive to organize crime
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:45.000]  influence in the gaming industry in new jersey by the way the new jersey law is
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.760]  so stringent it is the model for most of the laws in the country
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:52.120]  that have uh that have legalized casino gambling
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:56.680]  donald trump has been gone over by the new jersey casino control commission
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:01.400]  with a practice scope there is nothing there now being in the construction
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.960]  industry in the northeastern united states
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.240]  has he met guys who are mob connected probably
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:11.480]  uh is he in bed with the mob in no way shape or form
[01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:14.360]  and no one ever alleged that with his dad and people it is hard to believe he's
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:18.040]  one of the only clean people you know in that whole thing but that he was the
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:20.920]  outsider it was well known that came in and broke into that
[01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:23.640]  that's why he carried a gun i mean that's what i've read is that correct
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:26.680]  that is absolutely right donald trump is squeaky clean
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.840]  but you but be prepared for a mainstream media onslaught
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:34.360]  trying to claim that he is somehow mobbed up because all right so that's
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:37.960]  going to be the empire striking back stay there sir back in 70 seconds

[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:31.320]  as a best-selling author with accurate info i've read the clintons war on
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:34.840]  women uh can't wait till the book on the bush crime
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:38.200]  family jab in the bush crime family comes out
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:41.560]  these are both topics i'm very well researched on so when i hear stone
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:44.840]  speaking to it when he was on last time it was so incredibly accurate we'll
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:48.200]  cover some of that uh coming up in the next segment and then i
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:50.440]  promise i'll go to your calls i'm sorry to tony
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:56.440]  isaiah erica kevin dan and others i know i said i'd go to your calls and then i
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.480]  didn't and then the guest caught on but i will in the next segment we'll get
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:01.080]  some of your calls out of the way with your
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:05.240]  comments and questions on trump i promise uh but
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:09.240]  it takes a lot of will this fellows work directly with three presidents very
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.240]  closely work for many others as well but you know been in the oval office
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:17.160]  and this is a very dangerous book and the other one from the facts he stated
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:20.840]  from it that i know to be true because i'm i'm an expert on these
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:23.080]  subjects i've been living it for 20 years
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.680]  interviewing all the people involved i mean the cia pilots who were there
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.640]  unloading the cocaine with the bushes and the clintons i mean the bushes and the
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:34.120]  clintons are totally work for each other they are mafia
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:38.120]  they are the mafia above the mafia i mean they denied until the 50s that lakosa
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:43.080]  nostra existed and then it became only mafia was italian
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:46.440]  that's ridiculous the real mob is above that
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:49.400]  and really donald trump from what i've seen
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:53.400]  is trying to break into their system with the people
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:56.760]  but you look at the bushes the clintons to me they're the original mafia
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:00.600]  the true mafia the other term arkansas i mean it's not an accurate statement
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:03.720]  roger stone that they better watch out throwing stones
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.160]  in glass houses because these are the true mafiosas
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:11.560]  yeah there's no question i i refer to it as the bush clinton crime syndicate
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:14.680]  uh and my two books uh the clintons war on women
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:19.560]  and the upcoming jeb uh and the uh and the bush crime family they're really
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:23.880]  bookends they really complement each other in terms of detailing the
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:28.040]  profiteering and criminal activity that both families
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:32.040]  have conducted together rehabilitating each other
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.200]  profiteering together boosting each other politically
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.920]  you know i alex i had to reflect on that commercial that i just heard because
[02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:45.400]  uh as you know i cut my teeth in politics working for richard nixon
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:49.000]  and nixon was very very proud of his martini making
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.160]  talents he made a mean martini and he referred to them as
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:57.480]  silver bullets so as soon as you as soon as you would get to his
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:02.840]  place in in uh saddle ridge he would say hey how about a silver bullet and then
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:07.240]  he himself would make you a very dry martini and you would drink the martini
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:10.760]  you say wow mr president this is fabulous and he said yeah
[02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:14.840]  let me tell you my recipe he says you take a bottle of olives
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:19.240]  you drain the olives you pour in vermouth you put it in the refrigerator
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:24.040]  then when you're ready you pour the vodka or gin over ice in your shaker
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:28.040]  you make it as cold as possible and you drop in one olive
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:31.800]  and then that way it's very dry so what mr president that's fabulous
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:36.280]  he said yeah i got the recipe from church hill wow
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:39.720]  see i just want to get you on time uh to talk about these presidential stories
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:42.760]  because they're so interesting and i don't romanticize nixon i know he had
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:46.280]  some problems but many problems but compared to other ones i mean he was one
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:50.760]  of the least criminal from what i've known uh and that's why they took him out
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:53.800]  was because he wanted to actually be president and the bureaucracy wanted to
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:56.520]  be in charge is that accurate yes and he was he was
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:59.960]  he was challenging the industrial complex war machine good
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:03.400]  he ended the war in vietnam that cut into their their profits
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:07.480]  he opened the door to conversations with china and a relationship with china
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:11.560]  and then he moved to the salt agreement so nixon turned out to be a peacemaker
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:15.400]  that's not what the boys at the pentagon or the central intelligence agency
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:20.120]  had in mind now look nixon was far from perfect taking us off the gold standard
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:25.560]  enormous mistake the war on drugs a big expensive inefficient mistake
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:29.960]  i don't make the case uh as much although i have great affection for nixon
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:34.040]  and his personal resilience i make no case that he was in any way perfect
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.040]  but compared to the illegality unconstitutionality of what we have
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:42.440]  today nixon would be rolling in his grave if he saw
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:47.000]  what barack obama and the clinton's have gotten away with absolutely stay there i
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.600]  want to come back hit some phone calls we got you for the rest of the hour
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:54.040]  and then i want to get more into how we get behind donald trump because i mean
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:56.920]  folks the whole system's coming after him that right there is a certification
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:59.560]  he's for real
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:05.320]  retired basketballer kareem abdul jabbar is calling trump the isis candidate he
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:09.000]  says the gop frontrunner is doing isis's work for them by
[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.560]  preying on people's understandable fear to coerce support according to abdul
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:17.880]  jabbar trump's political stance might make people transcend abstraction
[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:21.560]  and actually commit acts of violence he fails to point out though the
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:25.560]  countless people on the left calling for violence against trump now
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.920]  naturally there's been no condemnation against this violent and hateful
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:32.760]  rhetoric probably claiming it's justified because of trump's
[02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:36.280]  crazy talk calling to temporarily halt muslims from
[02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:40.040]  entering the country until the vetting process is fixed
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:43.720]  hillary calls this un-american and against our values
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:47.400]  ignoring that this same policy was enacted by jimmy carter
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:51.960]  during the iran contras scandal iranians were banned from entering the u.s

[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:47.640]  in the final equation
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:55.320]  the elite have a nine percent approval writing for congress
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.680]  the people are waking up in general the attempt to flood the country with
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:02.040]  immigrants that are ignorant isn't going to work
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:06.360]  the overall global strategy is collapsing
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:09.800]  they have a strategy of tension to keep people in turmoil
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.680]  but when they even use those systems on the first world they're command base
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:18.360]  they're funding their power their prowess their good name
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:22.680]  their soft power in the end it brings these elites down as well
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:29.240]  roamed at the same thing 1800 years ago began its collapse
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:32.840]  took 200 years but it happened nowadays things happen a lot quicker and whether
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:37.720]  it's europe or the united states we see a willful
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:43.720]  suiciding of the good institutions and of common sense by a criminal class
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:47.880]  that wants to loot like barbarian vagabonds
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:53.640]  or visigoths the system itself they want to kill the golden goose and i say
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:58.520]  that from a cynical perspective i personally
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:01.560]  am chivalrous i have a moral perspective it's where my energy comes from
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:06.360]  it's who i am i'm looking for other people like me
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:10.200]  but even as a sociopath if i looked at it through those eyes which i do
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.160]  any general is supposed to look through their enemy's eyes
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:17.080]  this doesn't even make sense until you realize it's their very instinct to
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:21.480]  screw everything up we're going to ask roger stone
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:26.120]  about that about knowing donald trump for decades what really makes him tick
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.120]  because i think personalizing him is the one thing people really want to know
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:33.800]  about to commit their support for him what he thinks they'll do to try to
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.000]  shut him down after the mob claims he says are coming
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.280]  and i already see that drum beginning to beat
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:45.640]  and then we'll get into other facets of this in general where mr stone sees the
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.840]  world going and then having back soon for another interview about
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:52.360]  presidents in general and politics i want to talk about some of the delegate
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:55.960]  processes some of the dirty tricks they might pull try to keep trump out
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:59.400]  how we get involved the delegate process like my friend richard reeves is
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:03.080]  to try to stop that and that's a whole other interview as well probably in
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:06.280]  person here is i want stone to be with us a lot because of his
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:11.640]  understanding of this but now let's go to some phone calls
[02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:16.840]  again the website is stonezone.com it's an excellent site with commentary photos
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:20.440]  analysis decades with him working at the white house
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:24.440]  and his books the new book is the clinton's war on women
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:27.960]  and if you can find it good luck it's sold out in many areas but we're trying
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:33.080]  to get 5 000 of them ourselves very hot book right now but let's go to

[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.000]  four years ago and this is what donald trump tried to
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.200]  do to the people over in scotland because he wanted to
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:04.600]  build a golf course he's not a nice guy
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:07.880]  no i have heard that the one little chink people can bring up is
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:11.640]  imminent domain issues uh and then that's brought up all day
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:14.360]  and that's just what builders go through i'm not i'm not saying that's
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:17.720]  that's perfect that's fine uh let me ask you would you rather
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:21.560]  have hillary clinton bernie sanders or jeb bush then
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:26.280]  well then there is also the the matter of the four million dollars that you just
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:30.360]  now gave your x y for your recent divorce okay that's none of that's true
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  and so that was some kind of weird seminar call right there
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.040]  um that this is somebody i guess that just doesn't like this broadcast would
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:41.320]  you like to and that's fine make up whatever you want
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.400]  let's go ahead and get roger stones take on that
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:49.080]  you know donald trump is a developer and he has uh
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:55.400]  he has uh skepticism about so-called green energy about uh this windmill
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.880]  technology which turns out to be far more
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.280]  expensive than the older technologies to generate electricity
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:05.800]  he's built some of the greatest golf courses uh in the world
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:09.160]  he's built some of the greatest resorts in the world
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:12.920]  in fact he's climbed to the top of that mountain that's why i think he is now
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:16.280]  turning his energy towards saving this country
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:19.640]  that he's done every great real estate development that you can have
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:24.200]  alex this guy has a terrific life he's got a beautiful family that he loves he
[02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.720]  likes spending time with him he's a scratch golfer and he loves to play
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:31.240]  golf but instead he's made 18 trips to iowa on
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.160]  saturdays to meet voters and unroll out a roll out a
[02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:39.000]  campaign um there's no question once he becomes president
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.280]  he will be stepping down in terms of the quality of his airplane
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:45.640]  uh and his home not that there's anything wrong with air force one
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:49.480]  and the white house but i've seen the trump lifestyle and he lives like what
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.160]  he is a self-made billionaire uh in all
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:58.680]  honesty when we're talking about this nation's absolute survival
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:02.120]  then a golf course in scotland seems kind of monday
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:08.280]  sure and americans americans hate unmade people that made hundreds of
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.640]  millions like hillary with her total elitism where you can't even look her
[02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:14.760]  in the eyes this has been confirmed uh when she is at a
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:18.280]  hotel or being served by somebody doesn't give people tips
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:22.120]  treats them like total crud i've gotten turned on to trump more the last six
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:24.280]  months investigating him talking to people that
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:27.000]  you don't even know you know he knows or knows that say
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:31.240]  big tipper super nice treats everybody so good unless you mess with him
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:35.080]  then he's pretty aggressive this is the irony
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:39.960]  for a guy who's worth ten billion dollars probably more at this point
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:45.640]  he's a regular guy he's very very funny he's got a great sense of humor
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:50.520]  he loves a good cheeseburger he's got a risque sense of humor
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:54.120]  he's fun to be with working for trump i can honestly tell you
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:57.720]  over the years i've worked out an op worm for 37 years
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.000]  it has always been fun i've had a good time
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.920]  now i actually like the fact that he'll go on a lot of wild shows not just mine
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:08.200]  but something like howard stern when all these other fake stuff suits wouldn't
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:11.240]  do it we need somebody that'll get in there and get their hands dirty i'm
[02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:14.440]  sick of all this fake elitism and i did look into the whole
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.440]  thing you know he pays for it he gets it there's a plan for a golf course
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:21.480]  then people start wanting more money and then you run over them and build a
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.360]  golf course could you say it's bad could you say it's good
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:27.880]  wait until you're in those shoes the question is do you want would you rather
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.560]  have hillary clinton and then the guy didn't respond to that
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:35.480]  he just made something up well look i that was a crank call as far as i'm
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:38.520]  concerned here's what's interesting and that is that
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:43.160]  i love the way trump for example last night with don lemon on cnn
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:47.320]  or last weekend with chuck todd where he won't be bullied
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:50.440]  by these by these commentators where he cuts
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:55.800]  them off and he says uh uh no wait a minute chuck cool it chuck cool down
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:58.840]  chuck or when he says last night to don lemon
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:03.000]  excuse me excuse me when they try to cut him off which as you know is a
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.920]  classic media stunt to try to dominate
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:11.880]  these and bully these political figures well that's what they try with me and i
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:14.360]  just do it right back to them they can't stand it
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:18.760]  yeah i agree uh let's go ahead and talk to isaiah in california you're on the
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:21.800]  air with our guest
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:26.520]  alex how's it going good brother go ahead hey i just want to say thank you for
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:29.640]  putting me on the air and i want to kind of give a
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:33.960]  shout out to your info wars life have a lot of your
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:39.560]  products and they're awesome thank you but that's besides the point
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:42.840]  i want to say trumps he's a fighter you know you guys been kind of talking
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:46.600]  about that and um he's ruthless man
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:51.800]  i think he's good for america um of course i'm always skeptical of any kind
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:57.400]  of politician myself but you know
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:01.160]  people are going to attack him they're going to continuously attack him
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:04.280]  and i think he's kind of got the goal for it
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:08.360]  and i believe you know even if he doesn't win this war
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:11.640]  he's already done a lot of damage just by running the race i agree he's brought
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:15.160]  out a lot of stuff into the agenda that they don't want on the agenda and
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:18.200]  this is what i want to say about trump they've tried to emasculate us they've
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:21.160]  tried to destroy the image of an aggressive dominant male
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.000]  because they want a nation of servile cowards and if we were already super
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.320]  aggressive super male and attacking a bunch of places and you know
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:33.240]  uh doing bad things then i would sit there and say we don't need
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:36.840]  something like this but we have a bureaucracy that does all these bad
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:40.440]  things in our name but then once us weak and and and donald
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:44.600]  trump uh clearly has the type of attitude
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:47.960]  and confidence that america needs and he wants
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:52.200]  10 growth rates a year not these fake three percent that are really negative
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:56.440]  he wants to have not a monopoly economy but a big burgeoning economy
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:59.560]  because he's made his money off of there being a wealthy economy
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:03.160]  and he talks about this and he wants america to win and the fact that he'd
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.600]  want america to win all these politicians like obama and others
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.120]  they want to graduate up to the world government level
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:13.800]  they want to be the ones that mounted america's head on the wall
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:17.080]  and made us the globalist you know bitch basically
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:21.000]  to use you know for lack of a better word that's why they hate trump so much
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:26.600]  and he doesn't want to be part of their club he builds his own clubs and so
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:29.960]  that's americana and that's why they hate him so much is that an accurate
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:32.680]  statement roger stone i think that's exactly right look
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:36.040]  trump has built one of the great fortunes of all time and now he wants to
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:39.800]  make the american people rich trump stands for success
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.360]  he stands for for prosperity for full employment for
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:47.720]  opportunity this is why i think those who say oh he's not
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:51.160]  going to get any hispanic votes he's not going to get any african-american
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:54.680]  they're completely wrong there are aspirational people in those
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:19:01.000]  groups of americans who want a piece of the pie they want their own success
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.040]  trump is above all a capitalist and he believes that this country could be
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.040]  restored to greatness look take for example his plan
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:13.880]  to cut the corporate tax rate which is currently 35
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:20.280]  china is 25 trump would cut it to 15 literally overnight all these
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:23.640]  multinational corporations doing business in china
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:27.000]  would come home because suddenly it would be more profitable
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.840]  to do business here exactly the globalists did that to make our jobs
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:34.280]  the basis of them go overseas as a plan to sabotage us
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:37.480]  exactly trump would reverse that process and you would have one of the
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:40.920]  greatest economic booms this country has ever seen
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:46.520]  there's two trillion dollars offshore that's being kept offshore to avoid
[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:49.400]  taxation but he would make them bring that money back and that's good stay
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.480]  there that's important isaiah thank you
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:55.160]  erica kevin dan your calls are up next with roger stone

[02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:16.280]  and the author Roger Stone of the clinton's war on women is our guest
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:21.320]  but he is a bipartisan truth teller he's got a new book that's bookends with it
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:25.400]  coming out on jeb bush and the bush crime
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:30.040]  family bush crime syndicate put out by sky
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:33.800]  horse publishing we're going to go to dan in texas and others here in a moment
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:37.800]  but here's some of the bad news Connecticut to ban gun sales to no
[02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:41.640]  fly listers so that's literally lynching due process
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:45.400]  the no-fly list is something to terrorize people the shooters weren't on the
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:48.600]  no-fly list he was allowed in without proper vetting just as
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:51.960]  trump is warned and so now he says he's going to
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:57.160]  integrate into the no-fly list database so federalizing
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:00.120]  with a state executive order that's totally unconstitutional
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:03.320]  how those two things come together and that's a u.s. say today
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:08.600]  how can a governor's executive order trump no pun intended
[02:25:08.600 --> 02:25:11.800]  the fact that there isn't even a federal law on this yet
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:16.760]  but claim he's going to use a federal database at a state level to deny it
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:20.200]  i mean that is violates federalism it violates so many different
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:23.240]  angles of our system
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:27.080]  but the people didn't even get their guns illegally and they weren't on no fly
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:32.680]  list this is this is so amazing that they're doing this
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:36.440]  and then they're the ones that help bring these people in
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:42.520]  and then point their finger at us mr. stone knowing trump so well
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:45.400]  obviously he's been responding to this he gets more and more hardcore on the
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:49.000]  second amendment what's your view on this and and where this fight
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.120]  for the second amendment's going because i would have said this is a fraud
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:55.640]  having a state make its own law on guns but
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:59.080]  in tying to the fed somehow when there is no law but the supreme court as you
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:03.160]  know just ruled two days ago that cities and states can restrict the second
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:07.080]  amendment really unprecedented are they blackmailing the supreme court
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.520]  it's really extraordinary look donald trump is a very strong supporter of the
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:14.600]  second amendment as you know he himself has a concealed carry permit
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:19.240]  in new york he is packing heat a lot of the time
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.080]  he's smart enough not to tell us when you can imagine how many death threats
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:27.640]  he's had not just in this campaign but an entire career of being outspoken and
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.720]  being forthright he uh he rejects utterly the whole
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:36.440]  notion that san bernadino could somehow have been changed or avoided
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:41.320]  if we just had more stringent gun laws i thought he was masterful last night on
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:44.760]  cnn arguing that the exact opposite was true
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:48.200]  that if people in san bernadino had been armed some of them
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:52.520]  um the outcome might have been quite different so uh he takes a back seat to
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:56.760]  no one in his support of the second amendment uh in new hampshire in
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:01.800]  iowa in south carolina a gun enthusiasts firearms owners i think
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:06.360]  formed the backbone backbone of much of his organizational support
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:09.800]  and i know that he is counting he and his team are counting very heavily
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:13.720]  on gun owners for support in these early contests
[02:27:13.720 --> 02:27:16.920]  i remember during that debate he said he carries a gun and they went how dare
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:20.360]  you you're worth billions of dollars have death threats el chopo saying he
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:22.840]  wants to kill you and you have a gun but
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:26.760]  hillary she can have bodyguards dine feinstein can have a concealed carry but
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:31.320]  but not you how a police officer can but not you
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:35.080]  what a crazy idea let's go ahead and talk to dan in
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:41.160]  texas you're on the air uh with one of his top advisors mr stone
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.200]  yes mr jones mr stone is honored to speak with both of you
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:50.760]  go ahead brother yes uh so i know you both know uh that these elections
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:54.840]  are just one tool uh for people who want to
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:58.760]  basically write write every paragraph of the history books
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:02.520]  but uh constantly the their plans are getting
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:05.800]  are backfiring when you have inconvenience
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:09.240]  contingencies like mr jones your documentaries
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:14.520]  mr stone your books that you've put out putin uh doing airstrikes on isis
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:17.640]  i'll tell you why i think that the the 2016 election
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:24.440]  is is a an uninsured liability uh it's basically be it's the same thing that
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:29.400]  obama capitalized on and in 08 which is the public is so sick
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:36.120]  to the nth degree of the these pc milk toast politicians
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:41.160]  but at the same time the public is also given pop culture
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:45.720]  which which gives us uh these figures these rappers these uh
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:51.080]  reality tv people comedians and then they're supposed to satisfy some
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:57.240]  kind of primal thing and then and then we're told these billionaires like uh
[02:28:57.240 --> 02:29:01.160]  bill gates and warren buffett these these corrupt ones are our saviors
[02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:04.440]  but yet all these things are supposed to be kept separate like the milk and the
[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:08.600]  meat plate never supposed to come together into a candidate
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:12.200]  and so that you know it's just it's so foolish
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:16.040]  for them to think that they exactly the elites aren't gods they don't control
[02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:19.000]  everything napoleon hitler thought they were invincible
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:22.440]  but world events are turning against them and that's a great place to end
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:28.200]  that call will come back uh i'm going to tell you about something very interesting
[02:29:28.200 --> 02:29:30.680]  for a few minutes we're going to give mr stone about a five minute break
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:33.880]  and then we're going to come back to him have him comment on what you just said
[02:29:33.880 --> 02:29:37.560]  is history turning against the tyrants is trump just a manifestation of that a
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:40.360]  bellwether and then we're going to give him the floor whatever he wants to talk
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:44.360]  about right through to the end of the hour uh and more calls as well i'm out
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.200]  with jones with info wars dot com the book the clinton's war on the women by

[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:07.800]  who are actually skeptical of man-made global warming resulted in a heated
[02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:11.800]  exchange massachusetts senator ed markey invoked galileo
[02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:15.160]  when he harped the science is settled essentially calling
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:20.040]  climatologist judith curry a denier for believing that this could be something
[02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:25.640]  god made rather than something that is man-made and backed by science are you
[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:28.360]  saying there's no natural variability senator

[02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:20.840]  well they are writing these liners now i'm not and it just sounds how heroic i
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:24.840]  am uh actually i do have some fear a fear of letting
[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:28.840]  these tyrants rule my life and dominate and totally control me
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:31.880]  it's fight and flight i've decided to fight so is our guest roger stone and
[02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:34.840]  listen i can't sit here and be wishy
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:39.800]  wash in a key election like this and be political like everybody else and
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:43.960]  just sit back and join the big pillory throwing the tomatoes at
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:49.480]  donald trump in the proverbial stocks all tied up in the town square
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:52.680]  he may not be perfect i may be wrong about all this
[02:33:52.680 --> 02:33:55.720]  but they're all piling on what he's saying is true
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:00.200]  he's being demonized he's not playing politics as usual
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:06.360]  that's why i am supporting trump and his message
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:10.200]  against the establishment because regardless the things he's saying about
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:14.840]  our open borders about gun control about islamic terrorism about taking on isis
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:19.080]  about uh taxing the big mega banks but then also setting it up with lower tax
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:22.200]  rates so they bring their money back here
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:26.600]  they'll probably have a msnbc piece go lower their taxes
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:30.760]  to tax them to bring it back here yes they're basically tax exempt the way it's
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:33.640]  set up right now that's why they wrote these laws
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:37.640]  so that's why more and more i'm supporting donald trump
[02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:41.480]  just in his message period i'd be happy with the ted cruiser and paul
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:46.440]  and donald trump are a mix of those but right now he is the major frontrunner
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:50.760]  gaining steam the book the clinton's war on women roger stone
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:54.200]  now before we go any further i don't really know cj's view completely
[02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:56.680]  on trump he's been working here for three or four years
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:00.040]  doing a great job running the board and selling the graphics
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:02.840]  but he's also a technical guy and i noticed he was really excited about this
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:06.200]  new product that we're going to spend a few minutes on telling you about
[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:09.160]  we've only got a hundred of them private label to have it at the lowest price
[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:14.120]  out there but this is just the the best vetted
[02:35:14.120 --> 02:35:17.880]  technology in solar panels for the price they give you a wide shot of it of
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:21.160]  your tv viewer info wars dot com forward slash show of your radio
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:24.520]  listener and want to see this but whether it's for your
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:28.600]  hunting shack or part of your house uh or for your fishing
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:33.480]  uh cottage whatever the case is it is mobile like a suitcase you can roll
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:37.320]  around uh it's got the solar panels that come with it
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:40.360]  and the price from what i've seen when i agreed to
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:45.480]  order these months ago and do this deal is roughly half of the competitor
[02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:49.320]  and they don't even have as much power and it's not even the best solar panels
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:52.600]  it's just people keep selling the stuff that's 10 years old
[02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:57.160]  this is the latest greatest for the price and if this is successful which i
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:01.000]  believe it will be able to become a staple uh of preparedness products that
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.840]  we sell at info wars store dot com but it is the info war solar base station
[02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:10.840]  power supply and cj who's a big fan of it
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:14.520]  uh is here he volunteered to come in and talk about it cj
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:18.440]  also david knight ran in and pointed out this you can you can get a federal tax
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:22.280]  credit for this system so so describe to us why you're such a fan
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:25.320]  of the info or solar base station power supply
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:30.120]  uh most importantly the benefits i think um i'll waive in the cost of this uh
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:33.160]  tim frige uh had recommended i speak about this because i've had some
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:36.680]  experience building homebrew solar systems
[02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:41.000]  essentially to supplement electrical cost and it's always been a lot more
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  work than i felt it was worth simply because the cost of the panels
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.160]  um the technology lagging behind in order to get
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:52.840]  excellent panels of the greatest quality you need to look at products
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:56.760]  years in advance and i think what's great about this is it's a monocrystalline
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:00.520]  panel instead of a polycrystalline panels which
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:05.080]  are simply separate pieces of material that absorb light and convert to energy
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:09.480]  this is similar to perfect surface copper um in electrical terms
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:13.320]  you get more more energy or more more efficiency
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:17.960]  out of a smoother surface and so the panels themselves are fantastic
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:22.600]  they're rugged they've got um what looks to be extruded aluminum
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:26.520]  protecting them they'll fold in half um it's about the size of a
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:30.520]  large slim suitcase the company that's building these wants to take out of the
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:33.080]  market they don't want to put crap out not at all
[02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:36.680]  similar pieces of equipment go for about five thousand dollars
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:41.160]  so i say it's half the cost that's that's it's it's way way less than half
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:45.240]  it's it's quite a bit less than half to get something of similar value and i
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:48.520]  don't believe they're all in implementing these batteries
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:52.680]  um the quality of the batteries i think is is fantastic because it's a
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:38:00.120]  lithium iron or lithium ferro um ferrous type cell um it's it's gonna last a
[02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:04.600]  lot longer than a lithium polymer or a conventional lithium ion uh it's
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:08.760]  discharge rate is going to um be a little bit slower
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:11.960]  but because of what it is and because of the durability you get a lot more
[02:38:11.960 --> 02:38:15.080]  charges and discharges out of this kind of cell
[02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:19.000]  uh i think i believe it's up to two thousand um let's just be clear
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:22.920]  there's only 98 of these i should say because i'm getting two of myself
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:26.680]  i mean this is this is well you got to have this one in your house is back up
[02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:30.600]  and also one portable when you go camping or whatever i mean this is
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:34.200]  i keep using the term because that's what i tell my guys i want game changers
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:38.200]  i want the best reviewed highest quality bang for your buck companies that are
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:41.480]  aggressively wanting to dominate markets who don't just want to be you know
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:45.240]  sitting on their laurels and the folks we got this from are awesome we private
[02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:48.760]  labeled it to also have this price the leading competitor is why i kept saying
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:53.160]  you know twice the cost is twice as much and doesn't even deliver as much power
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:56.440]  and people just don't know it's just being marketed and folks are buying it
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:39:01.080]  and i'm not being mean we would sell it we would sell other stuff if it was a
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:04.440]  good deal i will not sell you something i wouldn't buy
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:08.120]  that's all i'm saying cj i immediately thought of my grandmother when i saw it
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:14.120]  she lives in a very rural area has co pd has an oxygen machine
[02:39:14.120 --> 02:39:18.280]  has a c-pap and a nebulizer and when the power goes out
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:22.920]  they do have a generator it's noisy but it relies on a setting supply of gasoline
[02:39:22.920 --> 02:39:25.560]  and if you're snowed in and you can't get that
[02:39:25.560 --> 02:39:29.560]  the sun is still there and what makes it great is that even in overcast situations
[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:32.840]  like you'll find in winter it's going to absorb
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.680]  almost as much as a conventional solar panel on a cloudy day
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:41.320]  wow other specs about the new info or solar base station power supply
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:47.240]  info or store.com along with an ac outlet you've got 12 volt outlets
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:52.360]  12 volts at i believe 20 amps so you can charge a car
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:55.880]  if you don't have a portable charger you and you have this in your car for
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:59.800]  example while traveling going hunting camping fishing and you need to
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:04.600]  charge a battery it's capable of that it does come with that led work lamp
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:08.280]  which in the event of darkness you've got a full battery and you need
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:11.480]  to work on something you've got light available
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:16.200]  it would be a lot of panels fold together and and fit so nicely for
[02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:20.440]  transportability as well in durability it's it's got a protective casing around
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:22.680]  it most of the panels that i purchased in the past
[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:25.880]  were very fragile you basically set them up somewhere
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.280]  and try not to touch them again because they're subject to cracking
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.440]  this is very very sturdy
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:37.560]  well i hope that you'll work with the guys since you're so knowledgeable about
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:41.560]  this i know tim spent years for years i said get me
[02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:45.720]  the best small portable solar unit and we would just look at reviews or find
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:50.440]  out what we could get and it just it just had too many problems too
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:53.800]  many issues we finally found something that i can really get behind
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:57.240]  and the price is so low it's so high quality for
[02:40:57.240 --> 02:41:00.920]  for people that want to really have portable power
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:04.040]  these are amazing units and it's something not just for preparedness but
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:08.280]  just for everyday life it's very very very very exciting
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:12.280]  it is forever day life you can put one of these in your house and in some states
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:15.560]  you qualify for a tax credit up to 30 of the cost
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:19.080]  some states would require that you somehow permanently attach it or hire
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:22.200]  an electrician to run the leads in it's not necessary
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:26.360]  and for safety to hire an electrician for the dc leads being that it's dc low
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:29.640]  voltage it's not a huge fire risk but in order to qualify for a tax
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:31.720]  credit you may want to look into it contact an
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:34.520]  accountant but even for home use if you'd like to have
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:38.360]  shave maybe a few dozen dollars off of your
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:41.000]  electric bill i think it would be quite effective
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:45.720]  absolutely so if you did use this over a year or so you'd get your money back
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:50.040]  more than likely you'd certainly get the peace of mind back that's that's certain
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:53.320]  i think it's the most innovative thing we've we've decided to release in our
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.000]  store since the gsock shock watches i carry one because we work in
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.240]  broadcast and well that's a no-brainer i mean they're
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:02.440]  really high quality watches that are super tough and everybody loves it's
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.760]  it's military grade it receives perfect time six times a day short wave
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:10.520]  and i feel naked without it being in radio
[02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:13.400]  and all the special forces guys have them because they are the best we have them
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:16.760]  discounted in four store dot com and it is your purchasing that makes it all
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:20.600]  possible we have free shipping in the store until december 18th and we've
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:24.600]  got a bunch of specials running right now at info wars life dot com
[02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:28.440]  info wars store dot com but this is definitely a great christmas gift to
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:32.680]  your family to yourself to your loved ones and others but i mean obviously
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:35.080]  you don't want to buy this for your son or daughter if they're not
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:38.760]  somewhat technical it's super easy to use but you know people aren't into this
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:40.520]  type of stuff and you probably don't want to give it to them but how many people
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:43.800]  do you know that are into preparedness or are into hunting
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:47.560]  or are into being off the grid this really is
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:50.520]  innovative and it's great to see the technology getting better and better and
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:53.640]  so much more stable the system is really worried about
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:57.000]  ubiquitous use of solar panels as they get better and better coming out
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.440]  that's why they're trying to force people to dial them in to the central power
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:03.800]  grid uh is so they can control the whole thing
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:07.640]  this is about decentralization cj thank you so much you're welcome thank you
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:10.680]  all right there goes cj folks we're going to go back now
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:16.040]  to our guests the clinton's war on women roger stone
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:19.800]  and we're going to be getting him on to talk
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:23.960]  more about that and to talk about the caller's last question
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:29.000]  is there a major political realignment happening and we do know
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:35.960]  that there is a major political realignment that is taking place
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:40.200]  and so everything we see out there is about scrambling political discourse
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:45.800]  creating racial and religious divisions to to to keep all that stirred up
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:50.200]  so going back to roger stone roger you heard the caller earlier
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:54.200]  he was saying he thinks that the political elite now used to have the
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:57.640]  mightest touch because they had america's good will behind us
[02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:01.800]  they had the world believing what we said even if we weren't perfect
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:05.880]  we've lost that moral high ground now and the world doesn't believe our elite
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:11.400]  even when they tell the truth but that old quote i forget who said it
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:14.920]  for who the gods would destroy they would first make mad
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:17.720]  and i know that's kind of attributed to a lot of different
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:21.960]  historians but it does seem as if our elite are
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:26.200]  degenerating quickly can you speak to the political climate worldwide as an
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:28.920]  expert as an advisor to so many presidents
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:32.920]  and and and where you see the world going and what you would expect donald
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.040]  trump to do if he was elected president
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:39.640]  well this is pretty simple the countries around the world are looking to see
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:41.960]  whether we're going to continue to be patsies
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:45.320]  whether we're going to be china's bitch when it comes to trade
[02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:49.800]  or japan's or mexico they're going to see if our military is going to
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:54.920]  continue to be allowed to atrophy and get to the point where we can barely
[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:57.240]  defend ourselves they're going to see whether
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:02.360]  this printing press monetary system of ours will continue to destroy our dollar
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:06.200]  they're going to see whether uh we are going to continue to go deeper and
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:09.960]  deeper and deeper into debt they're going to see whether we keep
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:12.680]  spending like drunken sailors and by the way
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:16.440]  here's a bipartisan problem republicans and democrats together
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:20.040]  responsible when the republicans held the house under george w bush
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:23.800]  and a republican administration their record on spending
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:29.880]  would make franklin roosevelt blush uh so it's it is uh you know there is
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:33.640]  discussed with the two-party system on the other hand alexa must tell you
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:37.560]  i was very proud to say that i helped former governor gary johnson who i
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:41.960]  know has been on with you many times get on the ballot in 48 states
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:45.480]  because the american people were ready for something new 70 percent of the
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:50.120]  people in the polls in that election told us that they wish there was another
[02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:52.520]  choice and of course there was another choice
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:57.080]  he was the two-term accomplished tax cutting pro growth
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:03.880]  pro peace pro pot governor of uh of new mexico and of course the
[02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:09.160]  presidential commission on debates which is not appointed by the president
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:12.440]  not a commission and most certainly not about debate
[02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:16.120]  was determined to keep this man off the stage
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:19.400]  what if people knew there was a candidate who wanted to bring all who
[02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:24.040]  wanted to repeal the patriot act or who wanted to uh bring all of our
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:28.600]  troops home from afghanistan the meat grinder uh who wanted to legalize
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:32.600]  marijuana and tax it uh what would have happened if people
[02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:34.520]  knew that guy was in the race so i'm very
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:38.120]  joined us about the system trump has chosen to make his stand within the
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:42.520]  republican party uh and i am with him uh and if he is the
[02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:46.280]  republican nominee i'm going to do everything personally possible
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:51.160]  i want to be very clear i have no formal or informal role in his campaign
[02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:55.160]  we are friends it's that simple i am not compensated
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:58.200]  i'm very interested in selling the clinton's war on women because i think
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:02.680]  it is the information alex that trump is going to need i think
[02:47:02.680 --> 02:47:06.920]  there's several ways to take hillary down uh and that's a whole
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:10.680]  broader discussion that you and i need to have i want you to get into any other
[02:47:10.680 --> 02:47:13.320]  facets we haven't raised obviously because i've been directing things you've
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:16.920]  got a lot more gravitas on the political inside workings i'd like to
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:21.080]  hear that with your perspective but separately let's expand on this
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:24.600]  my big fear has always been and i believe you
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:27.800]  you know off air and others saying no trump you probably won't do that but
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:31.480]  the republicans have betrayed him he said as long as the republicans don't attack
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:35.560]  me and don't demonize me and don't call for me to step down
[02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:39.800]  i will pledge to stay in the republican uh you know primary well obviously that's
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.440]  got the machine the muscle that's a smart move now he's saying hey i may leave
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:48.120]  if you keep trying to basically politically assassinate me and they
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:51.320]  spin that like he's breaking a pledge now i remember what his pledge was
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:55.480]  he's not breaking the pledge but specifically still
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:59.160]  i know he's probably just trying to leverage him correct me if i'm wrong
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:03.480]  but but uh he shouldn't let them kick him out or run him out
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:07.640]  uh what is trump really saying about that i mean what's the real trump gonna do
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:11.080]  very unlikely that he will have to run as an independent
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:16.600]  therefore when people ask me about it uh it it's a it's a it's a it's a mcguffin
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:20.840]  in all honesty at this point does he have the name id and the financial
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:25.080]  resources to do that yes so let's put it in perspective because uh
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:28.920]  my friend richard reeves is i think uh very concerned about this
[02:48:28.920 --> 02:48:32.600]  if they play the kind of shenanigans with the rules
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:35.720]  at the convention or in any part of the process
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:41.640]  that they used uh to cheat ron paul out of his fair share of delegates and his
[02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:44.840]  say at the convention where he was a non-person
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:49.880]  they wouldn't even call his name in the role the official role of the convention
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:54.360]  even when he had legally won delegates uh what kind of graciousness is that on
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:57.240]  the part of uh mit romney who had the votes to be
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:01.160]  nominated at that time if they move to keep trump out of the debates
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:04.840]  if they move to keep him off the ballot which some
[02:49:04.840 --> 02:49:10.520]  republican secretary of states can do then i think under that circumstances
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:14.840]  it may be the only uh a route for him to the white house
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:18.920]  and therefore in my opinion to the potential salvation this country because
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:22.280]  no one else is going to really change things
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:25.640]  the the the the two-party duopoly the bush
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:30.920]  clinton war machine profiteering machine will continue to try to curtail our
[02:49:30.920 --> 02:49:35.560]  civil liberties and make money off of i am now completely sold i mean
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:39.080]  mr stone you always have the right answer you've back so many great
[02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:43.320]  candidates it's so good to see a political analyst
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:47.880]  who actually is telling the truth that's it the only time trump should run third
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:50.840]  party is if they cheat him in the delegate process
[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:54.440]  and have jeb bush in there then who wouldn't want
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:59.080]  trump to run fine hillary or jeb it's time to go after both of them you've
[02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:02.680]  got the books out on them i kind of see a pincere attack here i kind of see some
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:07.080]  planning behind the scenes uh that will really give them a run
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:10.840]  for their money and it's good to see some guys with brains you and trump
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:13.560]  really given these criminals a run for their money
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:17.800]  well look i think uh hillary clinton is going to be very very formidable alex
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.480]  and uh she's going to have an enormous amount of wall street money
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:24.360]  the idea of her ever reigning in wall street is
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:29.000]  laughable uh and she and her husband have many many
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:34.840]  uh uh let's call them assets in the media uh who are uh you know who uh go to
[02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:38.120]  great lengths to cover up all of their blemishes uh
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:41.720]  their many blemishes uh and their outright criminal record
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:47.320]  their record of lies deception drugs sexual assault cover-up
[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:53.560]  lies upon more lies upon more lies only uh today i saw a video in which hillary
[02:50:53.560 --> 02:50:59.880]  clinton is now attempting to say that she never claimed
[02:50:59.880 --> 02:51:05.080]  that a an anti-islamic video shown one time in turkey
[02:51:05.080 --> 02:51:10.040]  had caused a uh the attack on the american mission in ben gazi
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:14.440]  i wrote a book on this for sky horse it's a short book but if you want to know
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:18.680]  what hillary did wrong in ben gazi go to amazon and buy my book on ben gazi i
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:22.600]  took the senate report but i gave you a roadmap up front that
[02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:25.640]  explained what the senate report was saying and what it showed you
[02:51:25.640 --> 02:51:29.400]  it's uh i think it makes the case that hillary lied about that now she's out
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:32.440]  on the campaign trail and she says to her stooge
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:36.360]  george stephanopoulos donor to the clinton foundation
[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:39.800]  but interviewing her on television therefore posing as a
[02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:44.040]  journalist uh when she's asked did you say that this was tied to a video she
[02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:47.880]  said no that's a that's a horrific that's i mean
[02:51:47.880 --> 02:51:51.880]  that's as bad as obama's saying he never said that you could keep your doctor
[02:51:51.880 --> 02:51:56.120]  i mean this is a new level of lying no no and the families for the four
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:59.640]  immediately contacted the family of the parents of the four
[02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:04.040]  brave americans who were who were murdered in ben gazi
[02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:08.600]  and lost their lives uh the parents are outraged because that is not what she
[02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:12.840]  looked in the eye and told them so we know everybody had this great
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:18.200]  celebration about her hearings and how terrific how she was before the
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:22.840]  senate uh i think that that is um uh not true i think
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:27.000]  that she was caught in more and more big lies for example
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.920]  uh this notion that she emailed the egyptian ambassador
[02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:36.920]  and her own daughter chelsea uh after the attack saying we've been attacked by
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:42.280]  al-qaeda when she's telling the world this cover story
[02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:46.680]  about an islamic video which is uh essentially a cover-up
[02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:49.880]  because they didn't want to admit in the run-up to the presidential election
[02:52:49.880 --> 02:52:54.200]  that was only weeks away that they had uh uh
[02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:58.840]  that american interests had been attacked by a group affiliated with al-qaeda
[02:52:58.840 --> 02:53:01.720]  and four americans had lost their lives that would be a
[02:53:01.720 --> 02:53:05.400]  handing the election to mitt romney and that's precisely what they feared in
[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:09.160]  this intramural you see these are different factions
[02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:12.040]  of the establishment this is how bush runs against clinton
[02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:16.280]  it's not republican democrat it's their it's their different factions
[02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:20.200]  of an aristocracy yeah it's like the harvard lacrosse team playing the other
[02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:23.400]  harvard lacrosse team probably rockefellers and the kennedys both
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:27.240]  wanted power they wanted to be the guy don't think that they weren't fighting
[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:31.080]  inside the club uh and the guys in the club like
[02:53:31.080 --> 02:53:34.360]  henry loose and uh and tom dewey and other
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:39.000]  king makers are choosing sides uh avril herriman
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:42.200]  a prescott book and you can see the whole sniveling snot knows the
[02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:45.960]  establishment against donald trump and at first i said could this be fake but
[02:53:45.960 --> 02:53:50.040]  it's obviously real it's obviously happening he will be destroyed
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:53.160]  to a great extent if he doesn't win he knows that he says what i'm gonna do go
[02:53:53.160 --> 02:53:56.040]  watch tv he's he's being banned off television he's
[02:53:56.040 --> 02:53:59.160]  losing a bunch of his big franchises he's losing hundreds of millions of
[02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:03.080]  dollars every few weeks here and there everybody just told me just this morning
[02:54:03.080 --> 02:54:06.840]  that he doesn't care i mean this shows i i said donal this
[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:09.640]  has got to be hurting your bottom line he said yeah
[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:13.080]  i've had some deals go south but you know i don't really care
[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.760]  uh this guy's a patriot and he sees that this country
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:20.360]  desperately needs leadership uh he knows that the
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:24.200]  that the career politicians are never going to do anything other than
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:29.160]  talk trump has a can do confidence that people haven't seen
[02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:33.240]  well he clearly loves the fight he's having the time of his life
[02:54:33.240 --> 02:54:36.840]  you know watching him be silly and stuff on other tv shows entertainment
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:39.960]  you know it's just you know he's having fun but once he gets in the fight
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:43.720]  you can really see that uh it's just good to see that male
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:48.760]  uh stamina you know not the fake slimy type we normally see but the real deal
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:51.560]  loving the fight not caring committed to the fight
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:54.520]  not worried if he gets caught up that's why they're so scared of him it's
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:56.440]  beautiful i want to take a few phone calls here
[02:54:56.440 --> 02:54:59.640]  we got kevin jeff erica monique in canada
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:04.520]  kevin and so many others uh let's go to uh monique in canada
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:08.040]  monique you're on the air with roger stone go ahead
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:13.240]  hi i'm uh i'm reading many of your channel and different channels because i'm
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:16.920]  on the defending the kids for the books they're pushing in the schools
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:21.800]  yes i even had a legal restriction on me given one year because i complained
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:25.320]  books that were for 12 plus given to nine years old
[02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:29.160]  so um yeah canada under political correctness has a lot of censorship what's
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:34.200]  your take on the donald trump situation um i'm reading about lots in the french
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:38.360]  medias and stuff they're they're pushing that there's an international
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:42.920]  uh boy boycott of um protest organizing against
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:48.520]  trump because they're pushing the medias are pushing that trump says things
[02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:52.760]  against the muslims and against the israelis so there is there is a
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:56.840]  there is a global movement now by the socialist and the big
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:00.920]  billionaires to crush donald trump which again everybody
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:04.040]  even libertarians seem about to be destroyed they think they go i'm against
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.400]  trump like that's the manly you know view no i'm behind
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:12.040]  trump now in his dark hour that's what you've got to do if somebody's for real
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:15.960]  i appreciate your call uh is it this kind of backfire there's a major
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:19.960]  danger roger that that they're making him the underdog correct
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:24.520]  yeah alex i i frankly think that the fundamental question here uh is they're
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:28.920]  trying to this canard that bush is something that trump is somehow
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:31.960]  recruited by bill clinton and in league with the clinton's
[02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:36.040]  i can tell you having known him this long and having been around
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:40.920]  and witnessed firsthand by the way hillary wanted to come to donald's wedding
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:46.520]  her staff tried to overrule her and she insisted on coming to donald's wedding
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:50.120]  he is the wealthiest man in the state of new york most likely
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:56.520]  she was the u.s senator uh from uh from uh from new york uh you can imagine the
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:02.280]  glitterati that was at trump's uh a wedding uh so she wanted to attend hillary
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:07.000]  there were some hot chicks there dolly no i'm sure it was a cnbc thing and
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:10.680]  hillary went because it was a political coup for her
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:13.720]  trump is a very popular man in his home state so
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:18.520]  uh so but the notion that he is in the tank which jab is trying to push
[02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:23.400]  that's nonsense the other notion that that i think is similar of course is
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:26.680]  that some people draw parallels between ross perot
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:30.120]  and trump i knew perot uh and i knew his people
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.000]  and i think they put on a very valiant fight with a lot of
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:39.320]  amateurs uh but uh perot as you know threatened the status quo as trump did
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:42.760]  he was an independent billionaire as trump is
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:46.280]  he would have brought real reform to washington he was neither left nor right
[02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:49.960]  in the sense that he was a populist with conservative but they threatened to kill
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:54.840]  his family so he got out so he folded now uh trump wouldn't do that
[02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:58.760]  i can't see trump doing that trump is uh he's already got secret service
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:02.920]  protection uh he is uh he along with ben carson because
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:08.040]  they are controversial figures uh and that is appointed by the president
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:12.520]  uh they have their own personal security which we of course cannot talk about
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.200]  uh but i trump's not a quitter he's not a folder
[02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:21.080]  and he certainly won't be bullied out of this race he is uh he's a shrewd
[02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:26.120]  individual and he will assess the race and he will be a candidate as long as
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:28.600]  he is viable i frankly think that he will win
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:31.480]  before that time i hope that's the case i know you've got to go
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:35.400]  soon do five more minutes with us rogerstonestonezone.com

[02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:43.640]  why he thinks trump can win this is important stay with us

[02:59:50.840 --> 03:00:14.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:14.840 --> 03:00:23.400]  in defense of human liberty alex jones
[03:00:23.400 --> 03:00:27.480]  so donald trump can he be el presidente
[03:00:27.480 --> 03:00:30.920]  will they plan the collapse on him after he gets in
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:34.520]  looking at the tea leaves roger stone longtime friend advisor to donald
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:39.720]  trump now in an unofficial capacity uh joins us uh in closing um
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:42.840]  what is the arithmetic what is the cumulus
[03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:46.680]  showing us that he is the god of wind
[03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:50.520]  well as i said earlier i think he can pull uh millions of
[03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:54.440]  voters into the process who are not in the process today people who have given
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:00:59.240]  up on american politics and see the futility of the two party system
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:03.400]  uh and i think he will run ahead of those traditional levels of
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:07.160]  republicans like romney and mccain among african americans
[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:12.280]  uh among caribbean americans among asian americans
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:17.880]  i think he can cut into the some of the core democratic groups
[03:01:17.880 --> 03:01:22.040]  and then he has to bring a whole bunch of people
[03:01:22.040 --> 03:01:27.880]  who've given up on politics of of all uh a cross-section of the election but who
[03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:32.280]  are just disgusted back into the process that these huge crowds that he's
[03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:37.320]  pulling uh when you examine them you have a lot of registered malele
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:45.960]  malele malele pardon me wow uh and uh you have a lot of working class
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:49.400]  people who all admit to you know i haven't voted
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:53.240]  recently or it's been a couple years or i stopped voting it one moment told me i
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:57.000]  stopped voting it just encourages them as she said
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.920]  so uh no i think that that's that's a part of it but the other reason i think
[03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:05.320]  he can win is more strategic and that is all of the underpinnings of hillary's
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:09.160]  candidacy can be knocked out from under her number one she is not an
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:13.960]  advocate for women and girls she is an abuser of women and girls
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:17.640]  bill has uh is a cosby type sexual predator
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:22.360]  he has attacked literally dozens of women uh hillary has been the point
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:28.280]  officer to cover up these vicious uh uh attacks on women either sexual
[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:31.560]  assault or raping number in some cases exposing
[03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:36.280]  himself and demanding oral sex uh bill clinton is an addict
[03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:39.400]  but hillary clinton has been his enabler and more importantly
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:43.320]  alec she has run the cover-up secondarily she says
[03:02:43.320 --> 03:02:49.560]  i'm a i'm an advocate for children uh you know we now know that it was hillary
[03:02:49.560 --> 03:02:53.480]  who gave the final order at waco it was hillary
[03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:57.640]  who who ordered her former lover and law partner
[03:02:57.640 --> 03:03:02.360]  webster hubbell to tell janet rino to authorize the attack
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:06.360]  at waco the brutal assault and she brags about destroying and making libya
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:12.120]  fell state she's a very sick freak where 18 children under eight were killed
[03:03:12.120 --> 03:03:15.560]  she's an advocate for women is just as bogus as the idea
[03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:19.720]  that hillary clinton is an advocate for for uh women and girls
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:23.320]  and then there's of course the multi-billion dollar
[03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:28.360]  global fraud of the clinton administration those are the three legs of
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:32.360]  the school school if you expose the graft and corruption of the clinton
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:35.240]  foundation you expose a record on women and
[03:03:35.240 --> 03:03:38.920]  children and they're the clinton tony and abuse
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:43.160]  of people in their scramble to power and wealth and their greedy little daughter
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:47.400]  who's just a brat uh who is described in the new york post as
[03:03:47.400 --> 03:03:51.480]  foul mouth short-tempered abusive uh you know
[03:03:51.480 --> 03:03:54.520]  i think it's time the american people learn about hillary
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:58.440]  yeah should america be ruled by permanent political class scum
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:02.120]  that literally can't even wipe their own noses and her spoiled brats
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:05.800]  uh just just running all over us i'm sick of these people and i would think
[03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:08.280]  the establishment would want to get rid of these people but
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:12.200]  it's just such a cowardly establishment they they love it even as they destroy
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:15.960]  their own power base you know even to the elite mr stone you and
[03:04:15.960 --> 03:04:19.240]  trump are doing everybody a favor i mean even to the elite they ought to know
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:23.160]  that the red lights are coming on the engine it's time to do an overhaul
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:27.560]  look the idea that chelsea clinton says i don't care about money but alex she
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:31.800]  lives in a 10.5 million dollar penthouse apartment
[03:04:31.800 --> 03:04:35.480]  her wedding cost 3.5 that's the classic disconnect
[03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:39.240]  the bill for flowers alone was a half million dollars
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:43.800]  uh the bar bill 300 and didn't pay for any of it if trump builds the money
[03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:46.520]  that's beautiful she's over here sucking off the taxpayer
[03:04:46.520 --> 03:04:50.520]  sucking off insider deals it is an abomination the clinton's war on women
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:54.280]  the book roger stone roger i look forward to having you in studio godspeed
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:04:58.440]  thank you so much alex thank you uh once again uh the best place to get
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:00.440]  hold on one second i'm gonna come back and push up on the side remember when we were
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:03.800]  told we were coming up for our freedom better maybe it's the politicians who
[03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:07.480]  hate us for our freedoms when donald trump said suspend all muslim
[03:05:07.480 --> 03:05:11.240]  immigration until we can identify the internet exploded
[03:05:11.240 --> 03:05:15.240]  obama's attorney general loretta lynch told muslims her greatest fear was not
[03:05:15.240 --> 03:05:18.200]  muslim violence but anti muslim rhetoric
[03:05:18.200 --> 03:05:21.720]  that violent talk is not american and will be prosecuted
[03:05:21.720 --> 03:05:25.720]  is it religious freedom or islam they want to protect they ignored it when
[03:05:25.720 --> 03:05:30.040]  trump attacked the first amendment in the same speech maybe in certain areas
[03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:34.120]  closing that internet up in some way somebody will say oh freedom of speech
[03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:37.560]  freedom of speech these are foolish people what is foolish
[03:05:37.560 --> 03:05:40.840]  is to surrender our liberty to politicians of any strike
[03:05:40.840 --> 03:05:45.240]  so we have politicians and the press beating the drum daily telling you to

[03:08:14.360 --> 03:08:17.640]  and you can see if you're a tv viewer uh the back side of the control room i'm
[03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:20.440]  going to camera him in the other way as folks can show the control panels
[03:08:20.440 --> 03:08:25.160]  looks like the deck of a star destroyer with banners of george washington and
[03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:29.000]  molon labé and don't tread on me flapping in the
[03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:36.920]  background you gotta love it
[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:40.440]  all right a few more minutes with roger stone author of the clinton's war on
[03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:44.600]  women and i'm glad i i held him over because i had a question written down
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:48.280]  here i wanted to go to him on and then i heard david night's little
[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:52.680]  clip about trump a few days ago saying in certain areas of the internet we're
[03:08:52.680 --> 03:08:54.680]  going to shut it off so the terrorists can't use it
[03:08:54.680 --> 03:08:57.640]  i think just like other statements he should elaborate on that as he's talking
[03:08:57.640 --> 03:09:01.320]  about cutting off not letting ices be on the internet
[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:05.960]  because obviously my problem is you've got hillary and others saying and and
[03:09:05.960 --> 03:09:09.720]  schmidt of google no no restrict anything hurtful sounding
[03:09:09.720 --> 03:09:12.840]  and facebook saying disagreeing with someone's not allowed
[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:16.200]  you know this kind of european style censorship where they're threatening to
[03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:19.240]  arrest paul watson for criticizing radical islam and
[03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:22.600]  it's the same censorship where they want to ban donald trump and
[03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:25.880]  arrest donald trump and not let donald trump go to europe
[03:09:25.880 --> 03:09:30.120]  you know if trump buys into this he'll be like a snake eating himself
[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:33.960]  you know trump well obviously he months ago was for bringing the refugees in
[03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:36.840]  till he knew that some were terrorists then you know because his heart was in
[03:09:36.840 --> 03:09:39.080]  it then it flipped and went oh i guess we can't
[03:09:39.080 --> 03:09:43.480]  so they demonized him on both fronts uh what do you say to that criticism i
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:47.400]  think it's some of the only legitimate criticism and i don't hang my head on
[03:09:47.400 --> 03:09:50.360]  that to dislike trump uh but a lot of folks don't want to be
[03:09:50.360 --> 03:09:53.400]  conned again uh to quote the who and so they're
[03:09:53.400 --> 03:09:58.280]  looking for basically any reason uh to just think trump is the devil incarnate
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:01.480]  yeah i think it's a misinterpretation of what donal means look
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:04.760]  trump is a big picture guy and he doesn't want
[03:10:04.760 --> 03:10:08.920]  the terrorists to be able to use the internet he would leave it to others to
[03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:13.960]  determine how to block them while not infringing on the other voices of
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:18.280]  freedom and people who aren't criminals and aren't trying to kill anybody using
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:22.360]  it so he's he loves the internet look at the way he loves
[03:10:22.360 --> 03:10:24.840]  twitter i mean he's the master of twitter he's
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:29.240]  gonna now got over i think four million followers on twitter he says it's like
[03:10:29.240 --> 03:10:33.080]  owning your own newspaper by the way the tweets you read are written by
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:37.160]  donald j trump not some flunky uh like it is
[03:10:37.160 --> 03:10:40.360]  i guarantee you and hillary clinton's almost everybody else says others do it
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:43.960]  i dictate a lot while i'm on air i'll say you'll send this out
[03:10:43.960 --> 03:10:47.560]  yeah well no i mean i know for a fact i'm not gonna get into it you can send him
[03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:49.560]  a letter and a lot of times he actually reads it
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:53.960]  or sends you a letter back from him uh he must just have incredible energy
[03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:58.680]  well uh look he's a very thoughtful guy and uh he still likes to do business the
[03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:03.320]  old way meaning that if you want to to talk to donald when i work for him you
[03:11:03.320 --> 03:11:07.320]  sent him a note it would go into him uh he would
[03:11:07.320 --> 03:11:11.000]  write his opinions or directives or or whatever you needed to know
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:14.680]  and he would send it back to you at the same time he might just call you
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:19.720]  anytime he's a very very accessible guy within the trump organization and i'm
[03:11:19.720 --> 03:11:23.080]  assuming uh within uh his campaign i would hope the
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:26.600]  same is true uh but he is his own strategist he's
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:30.920]  his own word smith he's his own messenger he's thoughtful he asks
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:34.360]  opinions sometimes he accepts your opinions sometimes he
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:38.440]  goes with uh someone else's opinion sometimes uh he overrules all of his
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:42.120]  advisors but he is uh he is very much his own man well he's
[03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:45.320]  definitely a maverick in closing and i'm gonna hand the baton to leon
[03:11:45.320 --> 03:11:48.840]  macaducey if she has one question for you she hosts the fourth hour today we a
[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:52.120]  lot of times we drive over into it it's all part of this newsroom war room
[03:11:52.120 --> 03:11:55.160]  situation without getting into inside baseball that you told me
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:11:58.680]  uh last week uh overall did trump like the
[03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:02.120]  interview i think he was very pleased first of all
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:05.720]  he realizes alex that your your audience um
[03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:10.760]  are the people who um we'd be most interested uh most open to his messages
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:15.400]  to whom he has to appeal uh in both the upcoming republican primaries
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:20.680]  but also in the general election so energizing the liberty base uh
[03:12:20.680 --> 03:12:24.120]  recognizing that while there is no perfect candidate
[03:12:24.120 --> 03:12:30.120]  donald trump outsider is so superior to hillary clinton uh or jeb bush or the
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:34.680]  old combine it's trying desperately to cling on to power and well
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:39.000]  so um i think he was very pleased with the interview i know you enjoyed it
[03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:42.600]  it was controversial some of the liberals in the media try to say oh
[03:12:42.600 --> 03:12:45.960]  alex jones donald trump they both believe you know
[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:49.960]  it why don't they hold others to this to this uh i mean i mean one funny tweet
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:55.080]  that i liked was uh show man comes on your show and the limbs try to
[03:12:55.080 --> 03:12:57.800]  intimate that he agrees with everything that you say and you agree with
[03:12:57.800 --> 03:13:01.560]  everything that he says it's an interview you have areas where you agree
[03:13:01.560 --> 03:13:05.160]  you probably have many areas we disagree that's not the point you're
[03:13:05.160 --> 03:13:09.240]  reaching millions of people with just why trump i think had a good time uh and
[03:13:09.240 --> 03:13:12.600]  he thought it was a great interview well exactly and i thought a lot of it
[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:15.560]  comical claiming that i said tornadoes were sent to take out
[03:13:15.560 --> 03:13:18.680]  oklahoma when i pulled the caller i didn't think that happened or i didn't
[03:13:18.680 --> 03:13:21.720]  believe a moon landing out i think they're confusing you with pat robertson
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:26.600]  let's uh this is just a canard well well exactly that's what i'm getting at is
[03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:30.280]  they always try to keep people apart they're scared trump will get the
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:34.360]  liberty base fully they're scared they know i mean they go on msnbc almost
[03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:37.480]  every week and say republicans don't take talking points from alex
[03:13:37.480 --> 03:13:40.680]  jones whatever you do don't do it and then they misrepresent
[03:13:40.680 --> 03:13:44.440]  because they're scared to death they want to dictate who can talk to who who
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:47.480]  can do what and that's why i love the fact that trump knew full well
[03:13:47.480 --> 03:13:50.760]  what was going to happen he knew that they were going to blow up and freak out
[03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:54.760]  that's what he does is poke these idiots and that's what's so original about it
[03:13:54.760 --> 03:13:57.560]  that's what i love but i did love one article that was talking about the
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:14:01.640]  twitter response to trump on alex jones and uh you guys might try to pull it
[03:14:01.640 --> 03:14:05.960]  up just alex jones twitter uh donald trump and click news and the headline i
[03:14:05.960 --> 03:14:11.160]  think was something like why do i think keymaster meets gatekeeper
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:15.240]  uh from ghostbusters when alex jones meets donald trump so it is pretty
[03:14:15.240 --> 03:14:18.120]  hilarious to think that you know they think of these two you know wild men
[03:14:18.120 --> 03:14:22.040]  getting together but it's so much fun to not care what they think and i think
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:25.400]  trump instinctively i saw him on on tv this morning he said look it's over
[03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:29.240]  for mainstream media and politicians don't you get it the people aren't with
[03:14:29.240 --> 03:14:33.400]  you so is that really the key here yeah i think he understands that he has an
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:38.360]  internet-based audience and this show obviously a great forum for him to tell
[03:14:38.360 --> 03:14:42.280]  so many who are getting their news from alternative sources what's
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:45.880]  really going on in america and his prescription for it otherwise i think
[03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:50.600]  you're just in a situation in which the big three networks and the corporate
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:55.800]  owned media the six major companies that control what we see uh none of them
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:59.000]  believe me are for anything other than the status quo
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.760]  they'd be happy with hillary they'd be happy with jeb because they've lined
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:06.120]  both of their pockets and they know they can buy what influence they need
[03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:09.400]  the idea of donald trump being president the old media would be no
[03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:13.640]  longer have uh first of all unique access to information
[03:15:13.640 --> 03:15:17.720]  you know more and more the the the net based media would start getting hot
[03:15:17.720 --> 03:15:23.960]  tips and inside information uh so it's the internet has democratized our
[03:15:23.960 --> 03:15:27.400]  politics with a small d and that's why the government keeps
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:31.080]  talking about regulating when they say regulate the internet
[03:15:31.080 --> 03:15:34.520]  what they mean is censor you and i both know that
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:37.320]  and i and what you're saying knowing trump well and he should elaborate on
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:41.960]  this he means censor isis radical islamic there's got to be like a lot
[03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:45.800]  with them out of the system but not everybody else who's trying to use it
[03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:49.560]  trump is trump would never curtail internet freedom
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:53.160]  it's too integral a part of his own political rise
[03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:55.960]  he admits none of this would be happening if he didn't have the ability to
[03:15:55.960 --> 03:15:59.000]  he would have a political life as you said if he didn't have that all right
[03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.800]  real fast i know you've been on for almost two hours you're probably exhausted
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:05.400]  uh i know i'm i'm i'm energized a little bit tired less while leon comes in as
[03:16:05.400 --> 03:16:08.600]  the fresh horse here uh you know to dominate the fourth hour
[03:16:08.600 --> 03:16:11.960]  leon i'm gonna go talk to reporters get some work done i'm gonna punch out
[03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:16.040]  you got the last four minutes of this uh segment to take out uh to the end
[03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:19.480]  mr stone uh go ahead with your questions roger thank you so much talk to you
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:22.680]  again soon she's so much better than you are alex
[03:16:22.680 --> 03:16:25.400]  yeah i know much better she's so much better looking than you are
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:31.640]  it is true all right go ahead leon well um you know i gotta say it's very
[03:16:31.640 --> 03:16:35.000]  refreshing to be able to speak with someone that doesn't hold back and
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:38.840]  obviously i think a lot of people are um you know that we're seeing that's really
[03:16:38.840 --> 03:16:43.080]  refreshing this time around so what do you think about you know the radicalization
[03:16:43.880 --> 03:16:47.080]  where is this coming from because this is something we were going to be speaking
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:53.080]  about in this fourth hour uh is it coming from these islamic schools the mosques um
[03:16:53.080 --> 03:16:58.200]  they're saying it's just social media and you know obviously trump is saying that he
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:17:03.720]  wants to shut that down in in that respect so yeah i don't think i i think there's
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:09.160]  some misinterpretation here i i really think that that trump is uh uh what he
[03:17:09.160 --> 03:17:15.160]  means here is that we already have uh a radical and dangerous muslim underground
[03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:20.040]  in the united states that's what this flap about jersey city and whether or not people
[03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:25.800]  whether they were dozens or hundreds or thousands of muslims who were celebrating
[03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:32.520]  the attack of nine eleven uh and trump of course said that and it caused a fire storm
[03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:38.760]  only weeks before that he correctly said that the uh that the george w bush had
[03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:46.760]  not kept us safe and that we had terrorist threats then uh and he really fundamentally
[03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:51.240]  believes that people need to know these two things well why do you think it's it's more
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:58.520]  important to not offend people than to uh save off terrorism exactly i agree with you this is a
[03:17:58.520 --> 03:18:03.480]  this is a fight between safety and political correctness so here's the fundamental question
[03:18:03.480 --> 03:18:09.800]  are we going to hurt people's feelings or are we going to save american lives right trump is in
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:17.080]  favor of saving american lives it in our high technology and an internet connected society
[03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:22.920]  it's not that hard to vet a hundred thousand people to try to siphon out the criminals the
[03:18:22.920 --> 03:18:29.880]  terrorists the scum that they're sending here uh from the decent people who are really seeking
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:35.720]  refuge and the promise of america and new life i have no doubt that that many of these people
[03:18:35.720 --> 03:18:40.040]  who want to come here are peace loving decent people but until we can sort them out from the
[03:18:40.040 --> 03:18:46.760]  criminals why not put a hole that's what's called common sense right and the the the establishment
[03:18:46.760 --> 03:18:53.080]  was afraid that people would see the appeal of that so they bastardize it to trump wants to close
[03:18:53.080 --> 03:19:00.280]  the country to all muslims for all time which is not what he said so uh it's just it's a typical
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:07.880]  mass media mugging is what they're attempting well roger stone i mean this is just really exciting
[03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:12.840]  because you know we got about one minute left what's the one thing you just really want women to know
[03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:20.040]  about hillary clinton she's not an advocate for women and girls and a very close examination
[03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:26.200]  will show that as her husband has sexually assaulted literally dozens of women it is
[03:19:26.200 --> 03:19:32.600]  hillary who's been the desk officer working from her east wing office to direct the campaign of
[03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:39.320]  disinformation and to discredit and disparage those women who were unlucky enough to be assaulted
[03:19:39.320 --> 03:19:44.040]  by her her husband so she's an advocate for women and girls unless you happen to be one of those
[03:19:44.040 --> 03:19:49.640]  unlucky women um who tangled with her husband then she is going to you know and i think women need
[03:19:49.640 --> 03:19:54.120]  to know that absolutely and when she was confronted about it you know she was confronted about it and
[03:19:54.120 --> 03:19:58.520]  looked like a total fool when she was put on the spot all right roger stone the stone zone stick
[03:19:58.520 --> 03:20:05.320]  around with us we'll be right back great to be with you earthquake floods winter storms prolonged

[03:20:15.080 --> 03:20:20.520]  water but have you considered heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are
[03:20:20.520 --> 03:20:25.800]  some things for you to consider how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood
[03:20:25.800 --> 03:20:30.760]  coal or propane but the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you
[03:20:30.760 --> 03:20:35.960]  you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times
[03:20:35.960 --> 03:20:41.320]  of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less

[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:06.360]  one uh sect of islam he's just made to have 25 billion dollars worth of assets and he gets
[03:26:06.360 --> 03:26:13.160]  over a half a billion dollars a year of us taxpayer money to run a large network of schools
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:18.680]  if you look at this chart that i put up here uh this shows uh as of september 2014 the number of
[03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:25.880]  schools uh run by the gulen movement in the united states about 146 throughout the country 45 of those
[03:26:25.880 --> 03:26:31.960]  in texas six in austin alone we just had another one open up uh in november just as i was interviewing
[03:26:31.960 --> 03:26:37.240]  mar call for his documentary now he's someone who's been called the world's most dangerous
[03:26:37.240 --> 03:26:43.480]  islamist now the person who called him that is paul l williams he's a person who wrote a he's a
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:47.160]  journalist he's an author of a book called the day of islam the annihilation of america and the
[03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:52.520]  western world in that uh he's somebody who's consulted for the fbi as well as investigated
[03:26:52.520 --> 03:26:59.080]  islam in that he talks about uh elements of a an islamic plot that he believes i don't know if
[03:26:59.080 --> 03:27:04.120]  it's true or not but it's his allegation that there would be seven to ten nuclear bombs explode in
[03:27:04.120 --> 03:27:08.680]  us city simultaneously on a day that's what the premise of that book is now whether or not that
[03:27:08.680 --> 03:27:14.760]  is true when somebody who has that as a premise says that even more dangerous than that is fatala
[03:27:14.760 --> 03:27:21.560]  gulen wow what is dangerous about that well think about the fact that bill ares was far more dangerous
[03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:26.040]  when he got involved in education than when he was blowing up buildings as a terrorist for the
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:31.160]  weathermen right underground well we all know there are propaganda factories the schools i mean
[03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:36.840]  yes and in these other countries he has 300 gulen schools in turkey he's got a thousand worldwide
[03:27:36.840 --> 03:27:45.480]  and 145 146 in america uh in the islamic countries they're openly operated as madrasas islamic
[03:27:45.480 --> 03:27:52.280]  madrasas but in the west and of course he has to avoid any religious connection in western
[03:27:52.280 --> 03:27:56.040]  countries to get his half a billion dollars a year of taxpayer money and that's the thing about
[03:27:56.040 --> 03:28:01.240]  charter schools are operated independently with very little oversight but they get completely
[03:28:01.240 --> 03:28:06.600]  funded by taxpayer funding just as if it were a public school in america he doesn't operate as an
[03:28:06.600 --> 03:28:12.840]  islamic madrasa but there is a very strong Turkification within those schools so children
[03:28:12.840 --> 03:28:17.800]  who are coming in who are hispanic or asian or african-american they're being taught turkish
[03:28:17.800 --> 03:28:22.680]  they're sending and there's 60 000 students currently being taught by these gulen schools
[03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:27.320]  many of them are taking summer field trips to turkey where they're getting an idealized version
[03:28:27.320 --> 03:28:31.720]  of both turkey and islam that really doesn't exist there are junkets that being that are being done
[03:28:31.720 --> 03:28:38.360]  for us congressmen people like uh uh mccall who is head of homeland securities is taking
[03:28:38.360 --> 03:28:43.000]  junkets being paid for by fatala gulen so it's very important that this lawsuit is going i think
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:49.160]  uncover some deep secrets of this closed group a very powerful group here right well and it would
[03:28:49.160 --> 03:28:54.200]  be just very interesting to know sort of what is in their textbooks and things i know when i was
[03:28:54.200 --> 03:29:02.040]  taking french in college we were they were teaching us french via teaching us about islam
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:07.880]  in france and and so all of the lessons were about islam and the headdresses and you know
[03:29:07.880 --> 03:29:11.720]  like the german same thing they teach you about the culture of the immersion and so of course it
[03:29:11.720 --> 03:29:16.840]  is a very very strong turkification and you have to ask yourself why are american taxpayers paying
[03:29:16.840 --> 03:29:23.000]  for this what is the hidden agenda with us well of course it is selling us an agenda of islam
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:28.360]  that's what we have to be concerned about if you want to live under a global theocracy because
[03:29:28.360 --> 03:29:32.680]  that's the fundamental tenet of islam that it should be a global governance and it should be
[03:29:32.680 --> 03:29:36.680]  theocratic we don't want to live in a theocratic i don't want to live in a theocratic country
[03:29:36.680 --> 03:29:41.000]  it's anathema to what this country is based on yeah and we've also got reports now of other
[03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:47.560]  islamic schools being shut down because uh some teenagers that attended tried to go join isis so
[03:29:47.560 --> 03:29:55.720]  there you go we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.680 --> 03:30:05.720]  climate alarmists openly talk about condemning you into an energy poverty we won't be able to
[03:30:05.720 --> 03:30:11.240]  afford a home bigger than 200 square feet let alone a car heating or air conditioning but there's
[03:30:11.240 --> 03:30:16.360]  another form of sustainable austerity that has been part of the global governance plan they've
[03:30:16.360 --> 03:30:22.200]  kept it quiet but now they're talking about it openly your food is on the austerity menu we're
[03:30:22.200 --> 03:30:28.280]  being told now that livestock beef pork chicken etc create as much greenhouse gas as all the cars
[03:30:28.280 --> 03:30:34.360]  planes ships and other transportation combined but don't worry the carbon billionaires already have
[03:30:34.360 --> 03:30:40.680]  a solution for their fantasy problem bill gates and google ventures have created the quote impossible

[03:30:51.480 --> 03:30:56.280]  don't take away our food until they've produced something else they can force us to buy they're

[03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:42.920]  much um so basically our guest today is going to be taking some calls i'm kind of interested just
[03:34:43.640 --> 03:34:48.840]  based on the responses that we got in the comments on youtube so obviously it's uh
[03:34:49.480 --> 03:34:53.560]  a lot of people are going to have some things to say to this gentleman and a lot of people think
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:59.080]  that they can't believe anything people say anyway because muslims are allowed to lie to non-believers
[03:34:59.080 --> 03:35:03.400]  so what do you think is i feel a little hot under the collar in here and it should be interesting
[03:35:03.400 --> 03:35:09.000]  but like on the heels of trump's uh comments of saying hey we should until we get a program in
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:12.840]  in place to we should keep people out because we're not able to vet people and that's been
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:17.960]  admitted by all these so-called agencies and uh public servants that we pay a lot of money to
[03:35:17.960 --> 03:35:23.080]  and can't seem to do anything really but here's an article norway paying asylum seekers to return
[03:35:23.080 --> 03:35:29.080]  home as refugee crisis continues they're looking at paying upwards of 80 000 kroner which is uh
[03:35:29.080 --> 03:35:35.800]  60 200 pounds in addition to having their flights paid for cut that's what a couple of two children
[03:35:35.800 --> 03:35:40.600]  can receive that and so they are trying to export people so we're gonna give you six
[03:35:40.600 --> 03:35:46.040]  thousand dollars to go wherever you want right and pay for your flights wow where do you want to go
[03:35:46.040 --> 03:35:50.600]  yeah united states like how the some of the cities do with the homeless population here
[03:35:50.600 --> 03:35:54.840]  right and then here's here's an article i saw this morning out of the express and it says world
[03:35:54.840 --> 03:36:00.840]  changing earthquake to hit us in two days claims seismic psychic and uh the guy's name is mr hooger
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:06.680]  beats he's he's predicted he actually has predicted an earthquake but what's crazy is this one he's
[03:36:06.680 --> 03:36:12.440]  predicting for the coast of oregon uh hit somewhere in southern oregon so uh all the way up to van
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:18.840]  couver down to central california will be affected by this and after i read that i'm like how long
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:26.200]  overdue for seismic psychic yeah actually back in july um here's a article out of ko in six
[03:36:26.200 --> 03:36:31.800]  organ will be toast when the next big earthquake hits and the northwest region is 72 years overdue
[03:36:31.800 --> 03:36:36.520]  for the next big earthquake so they're even predicting uh scientists are predicting that
[03:36:36.520 --> 03:36:41.960]  you know it could happen and they're saying 50 foot high tsunamis going over the cliffs if you
[03:36:41.960 --> 03:36:45.880]  look at the organ coast it's got a lot of cliffs they're saying it's going to roll over that 13
[03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:49.800]  thousand people going to die immediately wow by by that giants you know and just not being
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:54.040]  prepared for something like that well and that's one thing afterwards you know that's where you
[03:36:54.040 --> 03:36:59.800]  have a lot of people die in these things of drinking dirty water not having food not having power and
[03:36:59.800 --> 03:37:04.680]  you know it just reminded me we're saw in this new you know power station that less than a hundred of
[03:37:04.680 --> 03:37:09.800]  them that we have left in stock that we premium power pack exactly so we got that you can get
[03:37:09.800 --> 03:37:15.640]  your water filters here that don't need electricity or we have even have storable food so you know
[03:37:15.640 --> 03:37:20.280]  around my house i collect rainwater and i don't collect it to water my plants i let my plants die
[03:37:20.280 --> 03:37:26.520]  i collected so if something happens i've got water on site that i can filter and then drink yeah
[03:37:26.520 --> 03:37:31.000]  and then our make food with it you know because i have storable food as well and still legal to
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:35.240]  collect rainwater here yeah still it's you know they they make it illegal to water your lawn so
[03:37:35.240 --> 03:37:39.000]  pretty soon they'll make it illegal to collect the rainwater because they want it to all flow
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:44.040]  downstream and flood the houses downstream from austin texas but that i thought that was a
[03:37:44.040 --> 03:37:49.000]  pretty interesting um so they're predicting december 11th or 12th that's tomorrow or saturday
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:55.240]  wow i don't i don't think it's i don't think it's wise to make those sort of specific day this is
[03:37:55.240 --> 03:37:58.760]  going to happen because then if it doesn't then you're just debunked and everything you say is
[03:37:58.760 --> 03:38:06.040]  debunked and hopefully it doesn't happen hopefully your seismic psychic is wrong well uh guys do we
[03:38:06.040 --> 03:38:11.880]  have our guests on the line all right so let's go ahead and um bring in hameed adly um now hameed
[03:38:11.880 --> 03:38:17.880]  we interviewed you the other night and thank you so much for uh coming on the show you you attend
[03:38:17.880 --> 03:38:23.720]  the same mosque uh you you actually have been going to this mosque since you were i guess three you
[03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:30.200]  said and this is where um the suspect was actually attending this mosque so can you talk to me a
[03:38:30.200 --> 03:38:35.640]  little bit now we you know in the days since this attack we've learned that the fbi said that um
[03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:42.440]  um saeed and his wife were actually radicalized up to you know two years ago and that they had
[03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:49.640]  been planning other things and so did you get any kind of indication i mean were there any signs of
[03:38:49.640 --> 03:38:55.480]  this um sort of radicalization and how would you know never not not at this mosque i'm sorry
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:38:59.960]  just to correct you i i i've been going there since third grade third grade okay i knew there
[03:38:59.960 --> 03:39:04.440]  was a three in there yeah yeah so pretty much i've been going there all my life um and you
[03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:09.960]  know again you know this is a place where uh you know go for spirituality um to find god
[03:39:09.960 --> 03:39:16.360]  to find peace never did i ever see any radicalization or any any craziness like this um you know
[03:39:16.360 --> 03:39:21.080]  mosques are open to everybody muslims are non-muslims and we have a lot of people come and go over
[03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:27.320]  the years and he he happened to be one of them and um he went there uh during the friday prayers
[03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:32.840]  you know as you know friday is our holy day um and that's the day we we pray like sunday is for
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:39.320]  christians um so he would attend fridays and and and he would come in and um and i'm sorry you said
[03:39:39.320 --> 03:39:45.320]  something about did i see any evidence of radicalization um long lines on his part of the suspect
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:52.360]  yeah i mean i guess you know a lot of people say islam is a religion of peace but then you have
[03:39:52.360 --> 03:39:58.360]  other people going oh read the quran itself and and the the passage is there so how do you know
[03:39:58.360 --> 03:40:05.080]  when someone is taking it across the line to where they're now taking these passages out of
[03:40:05.080 --> 03:40:11.720]  abstraction and into like well this is actually what we need to do and it's not shouldn't be left
[03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:17.080]  in the medieval times right well you're always going to have a small minority of angry people
[03:40:17.080 --> 03:40:23.960]  i think anywhere you go um a lot of those verses um that pertain to those type of uh subjects um
[03:40:23.960 --> 03:40:31.880]  um will reveal that a time of war battle uh thousands of years ago but we are at a time of war
[03:40:31.880 --> 03:40:40.760]  in battle i mean people argue that this we this is now so well i would say we're not really um
[03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:45.560]  at war per se i'd say these are like different you know a lot of isolated cases a lot of nutcase
[03:40:45.560 --> 03:40:51.320]  mental illness type people that are taking these verses out of context um and uh going out you know
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:57.160]  massacring innocent people you know because you know this is anti-islamic you know and there's verses
[03:40:57.160 --> 03:41:03.720]  on the quran that clearly say this you know just to quote one uh chapter five verse 32 if you kill
[03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:08.520]  one person it's as if you kill mankind all of mankind so so that's just to give you an example
[03:41:08.520 --> 03:41:13.000]  of some of the positive aspects i think a lot of people focus on the negative and what i'm trying
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:18.120]  to do here is you know say hey you know um if you focus on the negative parts obviously you're
[03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:21.800]  going to have a negative attitude towards islam you know try to look at the positive try to look
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:27.400]  at the positive verses because many religions have these type of verses in them that pertain to war
[03:41:28.440 --> 03:41:32.280]  you know i don't want to name other religions obviously i my message is complete positive
[03:41:32.280 --> 03:41:38.200]  and love towards everyone but i would say you know many many different religious books um have
[03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:44.440]  well the old testament of the bible it's littered with you know i for an i um a lot of you know
[03:41:44.440 --> 03:41:49.880]  people killing each other right the difference is well people stopped for the for the most part
[03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:55.240]  they stopped killing people about 500 years ago so well people right people have stopped killing
[03:41:55.240 --> 03:42:00.600]  people bringing it back around and it's easy to i think couch something and well is it you know
[03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:05.000]  they're trying to say it's a hate crime to if a white person kills a black person and you know
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:11.480]  what if you kill anybody it's a hate crime right here and i'm against all yeah we're against all
[03:42:11.480 --> 03:42:15.720]  shootings i mean i'm against all of these these massacres there's a way to stop stop these to
[03:42:15.720 --> 03:42:19.320]  prevent all of these shootings not not just the muslim ones but the non-muslim ones like like the
[03:42:19.320 --> 03:42:24.360]  guy who shot up the planned paranoid i mean if he's a gun owner and i know a lot of your audiences
[03:42:24.360 --> 03:42:30.200]  are you know definitely a great uh standing up for for the right to bear arms and i would say
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:35.160]  what what if you you know you don't like to be clumped a gun owner doesn't like to be clumped
[03:42:35.160 --> 03:42:39.160]  in the same category as a person like that you know you can't clump them all in the same category
[03:42:39.160 --> 03:42:43.560]  so i would say you know if you see this guy for real if you can't clump all muslims and say
[03:42:43.560 --> 03:42:47.320]  we're all at war we're all going to go fight because that's not the case just like all gun
[03:42:47.320 --> 03:42:51.080]  owners are not going to go and massacre innocent people it's just not true you know what do you
[03:42:51.080 --> 03:42:55.560]  think about donald trump's comments on on saying that he would like to have a plan where we don't
[03:42:55.560 --> 03:43:01.240]  bring in anybody from i guess that's a muslim unless they until they have a properly vet vetting
[03:43:01.240 --> 03:43:05.320]  properly vetted proper a proper vetting system if they're coming from these right how do you
[03:43:05.320 --> 03:43:12.520]  feel about that well you know i i think that's um you know his the way he said it i think
[03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:20.280]  is is unamerican in my opinion um i think he needs to reevaluate how he says things because
[03:43:20.280 --> 03:43:24.840]  because the way he comes off you know he's always like targeting certain people and it's every day
[03:43:24.840 --> 03:43:31.480]  i turn around it's like some other group he's talking about um but um obviously every country
[03:43:31.480 --> 03:43:39.160]  has a vetting system so if there's going to be a system that that vets uh potential um terrorist
[03:43:39.160 --> 03:43:44.440]  or potential radicals then yeah you should vet those because even muslim countries have systems
[03:43:44.440 --> 03:43:51.560]  like this so i mean i'm all for it you know i mean just in general the to vet kugu and crazy
[03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:56.440]  people in general um there's a vetting system to prevent these kinds of shootings in general i mean
[03:43:56.440 --> 03:43:59.960]  i'm all for it but but yeah i mean even muslim countries have systems like this where they vet
[03:43:59.960 --> 03:44:06.280]  these type of radicals radical extremism is anti-islamic and we have to speak up against them
[03:44:06.840 --> 03:44:11.240]  these are not muslims and and they're making all of us look bad and and actually we're becoming
[03:44:11.240 --> 03:44:16.440]  the victims of of these radicals and and these extremists extremists because now people
[03:44:16.440 --> 03:44:20.600]  are targeting innocent muslims here what did you think about how they tried to justify
[03:44:21.480 --> 03:44:27.400]  the massacre at charlie hebdo for instance um or these two guys that attempted to attack the
[03:44:27.400 --> 03:44:35.720]  uh event in garland texas over drawing the cartoon of the prophet muhammad yeah exactly what were you
[03:44:35.720 --> 03:44:41.400]  thinking in your inner circle yeah exactly these are these are radicals um that are that are just
[03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:45.320]  on the other side of the spectrum like i was saying the other day um you know these are these
[03:44:45.320 --> 03:44:51.080]  are people that that are a certain minority of radical and i don't even want to call them muslim
[03:44:51.080 --> 03:44:56.520]  because some some of them are so extreme and so on islamic that you know i don't even know if they're
[03:44:56.520 --> 03:45:00.120]  muslim you know i don't even know if they're just pretending to be you know like that guy who came
[03:45:00.120 --> 03:45:05.960]  on um the uh the video that he was talking about trump uh in a very aggressive one who wanted to
[03:45:05.960 --> 03:45:10.600]  circumcise him yeah i mean i don't know if these are people that are just trying to become famous
[03:45:10.600 --> 03:45:15.800]  or they're just uh really angry and they're and they're you know just using it as a as a way to
[03:45:15.800 --> 03:45:20.440]  vent and and just you know again you know just a mental illness and and just craziness but yeah
[03:45:20.440 --> 03:45:24.760]  these are people that are in the minority these are radicals and extremists that that we are against
[03:45:24.760 --> 03:45:28.920]  and it's completely unislamic all right yeah i think the internet has kind of created this whole
[03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:34.280]  thing yeah it's it's a breeding ground for mental illness you know people with no moral compass
[03:45:34.280 --> 03:45:38.680]  yeah get these ideas and they're able to be be programmed in an instant and it can be completely
[03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:44.440]  anonymous to have their crazy ideas put out there well let's go ahead and take a call uh from kathryn
[03:45:44.440 --> 03:45:50.520]  in texas she wants to talk about is islamic doctrine okay um hi thank you for taking my call
[03:45:50.520 --> 03:45:58.200]  can you hear me yes go ahead uh here i have a comment and a question for the guest um i as
[03:45:58.200 --> 03:46:04.760]  an american have been reading a lot and studying a lot about muslims because when we have um a group
[03:46:04.760 --> 03:46:12.280]  of people who um are wanting to do things against our constitution we all of us should learn uh
[03:46:12.280 --> 03:46:19.240]  their rules and their books and here's the issue that i have when muslims are a minority they are
[03:46:19.240 --> 03:46:24.600]  taught that they have to be pretending to be friends with the jewish and the christian people
[03:46:24.600 --> 03:46:32.440]  which the quran says they should not be friend and so this is a moral value okay when a person is
[03:46:32.440 --> 03:46:38.920]  taught that they can lie to you about whatever it takes as long as this you know intensifying or
[03:46:38.920 --> 03:46:46.200]  increasing islam wherever they go to me they're not trustworthy anywhere they go so i have an issue
[03:46:46.200 --> 03:46:54.200]  with uh the muslims because if you guys are taught that you can lie to us americans in
[03:46:54.200 --> 03:46:59.880]  order to advance islam when you're a minority in the country then we need to be aware of that
[03:46:59.880 --> 03:47:05.960]  and here's the thing the gentleman who you have a suggest if he doesn't denounce those things in
[03:47:05.960 --> 03:47:12.120]  sharia then he's part of the problem and people in the in the internet and in the news are correct
[03:47:12.120 --> 03:47:18.280]  and saying that it is not this aggravated islam that we're dealing with this is the stuff that
[03:47:18.280 --> 03:47:24.680]  they will learn is in their book is their doctrine so i want to ask them how are we supposed to trust
[03:47:24.680 --> 03:47:31.080]  any of you when you have a doctrine that teaches you to lie to the people so long as you're advancing
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:37.640]  islam right right and i absolutely understand what you're saying thank you captain yeah so again
[03:47:37.640 --> 03:47:44.760]  you know this is this is again you know i have to stress that the doctrine the sharia all of these
[03:47:44.760 --> 03:47:50.760]  things um are open to interpretation so you have different types of muslims so you might have an
[03:47:50.760 --> 03:47:58.360]  extremist that is um ascribing to a specific specific doctrine okay that was revealed at a
[03:47:58.360 --> 03:48:04.920]  certain time uh thousands of years ago like if you look at you know here i mean hundreds of years ago
[03:48:04.920 --> 03:48:10.920]  like the jim crow laws right that was laws that were enacted at a certain time which are now illegal
[03:48:10.920 --> 03:48:17.240]  so when you're looking at religion and some of the sharia interpretations and doctrine these
[03:48:17.240 --> 03:48:22.760]  are things that were that were revealed thousands of years ago that these extremists are taking out
[03:48:22.760 --> 03:48:27.400]  a context now and when when you're reading this i completely understand but you see a lot a lot
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:32.440]  of different religions have these these type of things in them well but do you see how isis or
[03:48:32.440 --> 03:48:39.080]  these other groups are trying to push this narrative that they have they have the grasp on
[03:48:39.080 --> 03:48:44.280]  the true islam and and so then you see the young people who are really wanting to gravitate toward
[03:48:45.080 --> 03:48:50.920]  this religion and you know be as devout as they possibly can they're going this way and it's
[03:48:50.920 --> 03:48:55.160]  social media or whatever they're telling them that this extreme version of islam is what
[03:48:55.160 --> 03:49:04.680]  is the truth and you know more moderate people are those who aren't as vocal or loud um are
[03:49:04.680 --> 03:49:10.280]  aren't being heard and the other people are dominating the conversation basically right
[03:49:10.280 --> 03:49:14.680]  right you're right and this is an issue uh within the community muslim canita and organizations like
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:18.840]  care and others are actually standing up now and having meetings to address this and and have more
[03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:23.800]  moderates speak out against them because because we have to speak out against them in order to
[03:49:23.800 --> 03:49:28.920]  prevent these youth from being brainwashed by by these psychopaths these extremists these fanatics
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:34.520]  and your to your caller i would say you know go out and make friends with muslims go out and
[03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:39.240]  into the mosque it's open to everybody you know come to us and you know we can have a dialogue
[03:49:39.240 --> 03:49:44.840]  you know i was never taught to lie to non-muslims and that that that thing that taqiyah you know
[03:49:44.840 --> 03:49:51.240]  that was revealed in 765 ad um so you're talking about what thousand two thousand years ago so
[03:49:51.240 --> 03:49:58.600]  that was in a time when one sect was um had some conflict with another sect it was actually a
[03:49:58.600 --> 03:50:03.880]  conflict within muslims and that they're taking that out out of context now and isis and these
[03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:07.720]  other crazy organizations and telling people to lie but i was never taught that i mean i have a
[03:50:07.720 --> 03:50:14.280]  lot of christian um non-muslim friends i mean i i grew up here and um you know i've never lied to
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:21.640]  them to further any cause i'm just a regular person so you got you got differentry and between
[03:50:21.640 --> 03:50:25.640]  these but i can understand where she's coming from because she's going online she's reading you
[03:50:25.640 --> 03:50:33.000]  mean that you are not part of this diabolical plan uh to have islam rule the world it doesn't sound
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:36.600]  like it at all mr aldi i have i have a question real quick as we're going to break it what would
[03:50:36.600 --> 03:50:40.840]  you say to muslims who are coming here do you think they should assimilate to american values

[03:54:48.680 --> 03:54:56.680]  this important conversation i wanted to bring up the uh issue of state sponsored uh false like
[03:54:56.680 --> 03:55:04.680]  terrorism treason treasonous in nature that that uses um uh islamic people as patis and that's not
[03:55:04.680 --> 03:55:10.520]  to say that there aren't there isn't a uh talk theory of you know what what how this death cult
[03:55:11.160 --> 03:55:17.240]  that people mainly in the arab muslim world need to prove out because they do but let's deal with
[03:55:17.240 --> 03:55:23.320]  san bernardino it's just uh a new a third eyewitness who's just come on the record uh
[03:55:23.320 --> 03:55:27.800]  cheers he saw a driver yeah he said the driver was a regular white dude right is that what you're
[03:55:27.800 --> 03:55:33.480]  gonna say sorry to steal your thunder yeah there's there's uh he's the third eyewitness who said
[03:55:33.480 --> 03:55:40.680]  that there was three shooters uh they were large athletic and apparently caucasian and he this is
[03:55:40.680 --> 03:55:45.960]  an additional thing he said that he was actually called by an unknown person on seven p.m of the
[03:55:45.960 --> 03:55:51.160]  evening of the shooting who told him to say that he had he should say it was a peru who was the
[03:55:51.160 --> 03:55:58.120]  shooter and the other piece that has just come out is the a swat team uh medic said that they were
[03:55:58.120 --> 03:56:03.000]  running the swat drill at the very same time he said they only have him one or twice a year
[03:56:03.640 --> 03:56:09.480]  and so they were ready to roll and he never saw the shooters all he did was he immediately courageously
[03:56:09.480 --> 03:56:16.440]  took care to triage all the people so this fits into this larger problem of uh september 11 where
[03:56:16.440 --> 03:56:22.120]  we see drills uh you know almost 40 something drills that were the medic of the actual attack
[03:56:22.120 --> 03:56:28.120]  that happened and meanwhile the arab muslim men who were blamed for september 11 were protected by
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:34.040]  cia framed by israeli intelligent living without the informants yeah right thought how to fly yeah
[03:56:34.040 --> 03:56:38.360]  yeah no it's all there we see the a lot of those same patterns again happening here with this as
[03:56:38.360 --> 03:56:43.720]  well as that mysterious deposit into the bank account and things like that um so yeah i mean
[03:56:43.720 --> 03:56:48.920]  there that's definitely something that goes on not to say that these two were not involved but
[03:56:48.920 --> 03:56:55.320]  yes definitely um some eyewitness accounts that are countering the official story and just like
[03:56:55.320 --> 03:56:59.720]  after 9 11 they sort of dropped the ball and weren't ever allowed to question i think the fbi
[03:56:59.720 --> 03:57:04.040]  just opening up that house so early as it did to for reporters to just walk around and look at
[03:57:04.040 --> 03:57:08.360]  the driver's license and personal information it's just are you absolutely sure that there were no
[03:57:08.360 --> 03:57:13.400]  traps set because they said that they had set some traps to go off once the police entered the home
[03:57:13.400 --> 03:57:18.760]  but they they didn't work yeah you know so i mean that's just dangerous so yeah that was mr adly the
[03:57:18.760 --> 03:57:24.840]  final comment on this yes i'm sorry what was the question well i mean how do you feel about it seems
[03:57:24.840 --> 03:57:30.520]  like sponsored terror and then like using saying like muslims are responsible for all these terror
[03:57:30.520 --> 03:57:34.360]  attacks when it may or may not be true like the sambert adino thing there's definitely some questions
[03:57:34.360 --> 03:57:39.400]  of who was involved in it so what do you think yeah i mean um you know if that's the case then
[03:57:39.400 --> 03:57:45.160]  obviously it breaks my heart because then um you know innocent people um are being victimized on
[03:57:45.160 --> 03:57:49.480]  both sides of the spectrum uh not only the people that are getting killed but also the people that
[03:57:49.480 --> 03:57:54.360]  have to suffer the backlash and that's one of the reasons why i'm putting myself out there um is
[03:57:54.360 --> 03:57:59.320]  because look i mean if you're mad you know get mad at me uh don't get mad at the innocent women
[03:57:59.320 --> 03:58:02.920]  and children that you see on the street that are wearing the headscarf or that are dressed in
[03:58:02.920 --> 03:58:09.240]  judicial clothes because they're just regular people and um you know if if these uh events are
[03:58:09.240 --> 03:58:14.760]  what you say they are then it just further saddened me and breaks my heart yeah absolutely well you
[03:58:14.760 --> 03:58:19.640]  know i think we're gonna stay on this story as well it's definitely got a lot of traction
[03:58:19.640 --> 03:58:24.360]  adly and uh and reach out to people out there talk to him he started a specific twitter and a
