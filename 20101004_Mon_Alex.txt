[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:16.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16.920 --> 00:20.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.680 --> 00:28.760]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:28.760 --> 00:32.120]  Thank you so much for joining us on this October 4,
[00:32.120 --> 00:35.360]  2010 Monday edition of the Global Transmission
[00:35.360 --> 00:37.640]  Against Terany.
[00:37.640 --> 00:39.320]  We had him on a few weeks ago, but they've
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.280]  since had meetings at the state legislature.
[00:42.280 --> 00:46.160]  Daryl Metcalf, a member of the Pennsylvania legislature,
[00:46.160 --> 00:49.800]  who was spied on by basically Mossad,
[00:49.800 --> 00:50.680]  is going to be joining us.
[00:50.680 --> 00:53.080]  The head of Homeland Security in the state
[00:53.080 --> 00:55.200]  was paying taxpayer money to the Israeli group,
[00:55.200 --> 00:57.200]  has stepped down.
[00:57.200 --> 01:00.880]  And there are criminals slash civil investigations going on.
[01:00.880 --> 01:03.040]  London Telegraph writer James Dillingpole
[01:03.040 --> 01:04.760]  will be joining us for 30 minutes
[01:04.760 --> 01:07.320]  at the last half of the second hour.
[01:07.320 --> 01:09.400]  To discuss the video we played on Friday
[01:09.400 --> 01:12.240]  and on the Sunday broadcast, this 10-10 project
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.440]  funded by the big carbon exchange Al Gore and others,
[01:15.440 --> 01:19.680]  showing children being murdered, being blown into bits,
[01:19.680 --> 01:22.200]  blood all over the other children.
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.080]  And they admit the message is, support carbon taxes or die.
[01:27.080 --> 01:30.080]  And we've got Al Gore last year telling school children
[01:30.080 --> 01:32.720]  in the US, tell your parents what to do.
[01:32.720 --> 01:35.760]  They don't know best, support the carbon taxes,
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.040]  pay me all your money, or the earth will basically die.
[01:40.040 --> 01:42.240]  And we have ABC News in Australia with a carbon
[01:42.240 --> 01:44.840]  calculator teaching children when to die.
[01:44.840 --> 01:46.880]  That was the headline.
[01:46.880 --> 01:50.200]  ABC News, that's ABC Australia, teaches kids
[01:50.200 --> 01:51.600]  when they should die.
[01:51.600 --> 01:53.680]  That was all in Paul Watson's article
[01:53.680 --> 01:57.240]  that he wrote on Friday, Dillingpole also covered it.
[01:57.240 --> 02:00.280]  But now we have a clip of Pichari on Al Jazeera saying,
[02:00.280 --> 02:01.920]  we're going after the children.
[02:01.920 --> 02:04.480]  They're much easier to get than adults
[02:04.480 --> 02:05.840]  because they're gullible.
[02:05.840 --> 02:08.080]  And parents just put them in government training camps,
[02:08.080 --> 02:09.800]  known as public schools worldwide,
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.000]  where the globalists can basically have their way
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.680]  with them in these modern reeducation centers.
[02:16.680 --> 02:18.920]  So that is coming up with James Dillingpole,
[02:18.920 --> 02:22.280]  the latest on the global warming, global taxation,
[02:22.280 --> 02:25.360]  hoax situation.
[02:25.360 --> 02:29.960]  Another big report out at prisonplanet.com this morning.
[02:29.960 --> 02:32.760]  I covered this on Sunday, but Watson's got a story
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.760]  out on it today, closing the circle,
[02:36.760 --> 02:38.360]  giving you the full breakdown.
[02:39.440 --> 02:43.040]  The government has an appetite for your blood.
[02:43.040 --> 02:45.800]  And they're now announcing different ways
[02:45.800 --> 02:46.760]  they're going to be taking your blood
[02:46.760 --> 02:48.000]  at warrantless checkpoints.
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.840]  And when you go to the DMV, or when your baby's born,
[02:51.840 --> 02:54.480]  all going into the government databases,
[02:54.480 --> 02:56.480]  and this is out of the Washington Post,
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.600]  the original source article that Paul Joseph Watson
[03:02.920 --> 03:07.240]  is sourcing from, the government has an appetite
[03:07.240 --> 03:09.160]  for your blood.
[03:09.160 --> 03:14.160]  Dutch politician on trial, on hate speech charges.
[03:14.160 --> 03:17.400]  And he's criticizing Islam and saying
[03:17.400 --> 03:19.280]  that it wants to take over Europe.
[03:19.280 --> 03:20.800]  And whether that's true or not,
[03:20.800 --> 03:21.880]  that's his free speech.
[03:21.880 --> 03:24.520]  But Europe, once a bastion of free speech
[03:24.520 --> 03:28.240]  in the last 50 years, he's facing prison time.
[03:28.240 --> 03:32.680]  Gert Wilders went on trial Monday for alleged hate speech,
[03:32.680 --> 03:34.960]  even as his popularity and influence in the Netherlands
[03:34.960 --> 03:36.520]  are near all-time highs.
[03:36.520 --> 03:39.000]  And other countries in Europe where they're having
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.680]  anti-immigration, open border parties
[03:41.680 --> 03:43.800]  start taking power in the parliament,
[03:43.800 --> 03:45.840]  the other groups in parliament are getting together,
[03:45.840 --> 03:49.280]  saying, well, we're just going to nullify your votes.
[03:49.280 --> 03:50.640]  That's happening in several nations.
[03:50.640 --> 03:52.160]  We'll be talking about that.
[03:52.160 --> 03:55.400]  So regardless of where you sit on this whole issue,
[03:55.400 --> 03:58.320]  people either have their right to free speech or they don't.
[03:58.320 --> 03:59.920]  And this all started in Europe about,
[03:59.920 --> 04:01.960]  oh, you can't praise Nazis,
[04:01.960 --> 04:05.920]  or you can't deny the Holocaust.
[04:05.920 --> 04:07.800]  And a lot of people said, well, that sounds reasonable.
[04:07.800 --> 04:08.880]  Those are bad groups.
[04:10.160 --> 04:13.000]  But it's used against everybody.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.600]  And now it's used against criticizing the European Union.
[04:16.600 --> 04:20.760]  And it's used for criticizing major GMO producers.
[04:21.680 --> 04:24.400]  Remember Robin Page five years ago, six years ago,
[04:24.400 --> 04:28.520]  the BBC top reporter was at a rally and said,
[04:28.520 --> 04:31.320]  rural communities deserve the same rights
[04:31.320 --> 04:33.480]  as homosexuals and Muslims.
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.920]  Boom, arrested.
[04:34.920 --> 04:37.560]  For the word homosexual, they said was hurtful.
[04:38.520 --> 04:40.000]  And they're trying to pass new laws
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.240]  where if anything you say is even offensive to a group,
[04:43.240 --> 04:47.080]  you've got to jail. So this is the tyranny
[04:47.080 --> 04:52.080]  that we are dealing with in a big, big way.
[04:52.520 --> 04:54.720]  We're also gonna get into all of this hyping.
[04:54.720 --> 04:56.680]  And that's our top story when we come back
[04:56.680 --> 05:00.040]  for terror attacks in Europe and the United States.
[05:00.040 --> 05:00.880]  Listen up, friends.
[05:00.880 --> 05:03.160]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[05:03.160 --> 05:05.320]  The mainstream media is now admitting
[05:05.320 --> 05:06.960]  that we're going into a depression.
[05:06.960 --> 05:09.840]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[05:09.840 --> 05:11.520]  You need to get your own supply
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.240]  of high quality, storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:15.240 --> 05:17.000]  They're the best company out there.
[05:17.000 --> 05:18.840]  The longest continually operating
[05:18.840 --> 05:21.120]  with a ton of great food to choose from.
[05:21.120 --> 05:23.440]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis.
[05:23.440 --> 05:25.440]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling you
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.800]  like some of the other guys.
[05:26.800 --> 05:28.800]  Try their new evacuation pack,
[05:28.800 --> 05:31.360]  a two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[05:31.360 --> 05:33.760]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.000]  with open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.840]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations.
[05:39.840 --> 05:42.040]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[05:42.040 --> 05:44.440]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:44.440 --> 05:46.480]  Go to their website online right now.

[05:52.200 --> 05:56.120]  Again, on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex
[05:56.120 --> 06:00.120]  or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[06:00.120 --> 06:04.240]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[06:04.240 --> 06:05.520]  tyranny is here.
[06:05.520 --> 06:09.440]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[06:09.440 --> 06:11.840]  It really says that the state is God.
[06:11.840 --> 06:14.440]  The United States is now recognized globally
[06:14.440 --> 06:17.560]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[06:17.560 --> 06:19.960]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[06:19.960 --> 06:22.040]  of a secret network of FEMA camps
[06:22.040 --> 06:24.200]  now being expanded nationwide.
[06:24.200 --> 06:26.640]  This documentary exposes how the continuity
[06:26.640 --> 06:28.320]  of government program has established
[06:28.320 --> 06:30.200]  an old powerful shadow state.
[06:30.200 --> 06:32.600]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths
[06:32.600 --> 06:34.360]  to which our republic has fallen.
[06:34.360 --> 06:36.840]  Prepare to enter the secret of world
[06:36.840 --> 06:40.440]  of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras,
[06:40.440 --> 06:43.400]  citizen spies, stage terror and cameras
[06:43.400 --> 06:44.560]  on every street corner.
[06:44.560 --> 06:45.800]  It's only the beginning
[06:45.800 --> 06:48.160]  of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[06:48.160 --> 06:50.080]  The police state isn't coming.
[06:50.080 --> 06:51.160]  It's here.

[07:00.840 --> 07:03.520]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator
[07:03.520 --> 07:05.160]  infuses the respiratory system
[07:05.160 --> 07:07.960]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[07:07.960 --> 07:09.880]  yet many are unaware of the entire function
[07:09.880 --> 07:11.080]  of the Silver Lungs system
[07:11.080 --> 07:13.680]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[07:13.680 --> 07:16.280]  anywhere in or on the body.
[07:16.280 --> 07:17.880]  My name is Mario Safaldi
[07:17.880 --> 07:20.960]  and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[07:20.960 --> 07:22.800]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce
[07:22.800 --> 07:25.640]  endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[07:25.640 --> 07:27.960]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators
[07:27.960 --> 07:31.000]  and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.760]  directly to key target areas.
[07:33.760 --> 07:37.920]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs,
[07:37.920 --> 07:39.320]  topically to the skin,
[07:39.320 --> 07:41.680]  and orally for the digestive system.
[07:41.680 --> 07:43.840]  Be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour
[07:43.840 --> 07:45.320]  of the Silver Lungs system
[07:45.320 --> 07:49.000]  at www.silverlungs.com
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.200]  As well, we are always ready to answer
[07:54.200 --> 07:56.000]  any questions you may have.
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.440]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[07:59.440 --> 08:05.440]  Crashing Through the Lies and Disinformation,
[08:05.440 --> 08:10.440]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:16.440 --> 08:21.440]  Well, we predicted it with precision back in July.
[08:21.440 --> 08:24.440]  Three months ago, we put out multiple reports
[08:24.440 --> 08:27.440]  at infowars.com, prisonplanet.com,
[08:27.440 --> 08:32.440]  and this syndicated radio slash television transmission
[08:32.440 --> 08:35.440]  that going into the election cycle,
[08:35.440 --> 08:38.440]  probably in October, there would either be the hype
[08:38.440 --> 08:42.440]  that domestic groups were going to launch terror attacks,
[08:42.440 --> 08:45.440]  along with, quote, Muslims,
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.440]  or they would actually launch the attack.
[08:49.440 --> 08:52.440]  And we also pointed out that we saw a lot of the hype
[08:52.440 --> 08:55.440]  pointing towards an attack on Europe
[08:55.440 --> 09:00.440]  to get Europe behind all these expansions of the wars
[09:00.440 --> 09:03.440]  in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the continuation
[09:03.440 --> 09:06.440]  that is ongoing inside Iraq.
[09:06.440 --> 09:11.440]  Another big tell is that the system knows
[09:11.440 --> 09:16.440]  that 9-11 Truth has taken one of their main mechanisms,
[09:16.440 --> 09:19.440]  problem reaction solutions, staged terror,
[09:19.440 --> 09:22.440]  false flags, self-inflicted, inside job,
[09:22.440 --> 09:25.440]  government-sponsored terror operations.
[09:25.440 --> 09:30.440]  We've taken that favored mechanism
[09:30.440 --> 09:34.440]  and basically damaged it, almost destroyed it.
[09:34.440 --> 09:36.440]  And so in the last six months or so,
[09:36.440 --> 09:39.440]  you've seen a massive rehabilitation of it,
[09:39.440 --> 09:41.440]  but it's failed, but they've attempted
[09:41.440 --> 09:44.440]  by having John Stewart and Stephen Colbert
[09:44.440 --> 09:48.440]  and having Beck and having Limbaugh and Hannity.
[09:48.440 --> 09:49.440]  It's a talking point.
[09:49.440 --> 09:53.440]  Come out and imply 9-11 Truthers are with the terrorist
[09:53.440 --> 09:55.440]  and they're going to attack you
[09:55.440 --> 09:58.440]  and therefore the socialized health care
[09:58.440 --> 10:00.440]  and their communists, basically.
[10:00.440 --> 10:02.440]  It doesn't matter if 9-11 Truthers
[10:02.440 --> 10:05.440]  are across the political spectrum
[10:05.440 --> 10:07.440]  and are just looking at the facts and saying,
[10:07.440 --> 10:11.440]  hey, all the evidence shows this was an inside job.
[10:11.440 --> 10:15.440]  And so we see them rehabilitating the idea
[10:15.440 --> 10:18.440]  that terror is real and going to hit us any minute
[10:18.440 --> 10:20.440]  when they had a Gallup poll just a month ago
[10:20.440 --> 10:24.440]  showing 1% of Americans believe terror
[10:24.440 --> 10:26.440]  is the number one issue in this country.
[10:26.440 --> 10:31.440]  Down from 44%, just a few years before that
[10:31.440 --> 10:34.440]  and before that, it was as high as 80%
[10:34.440 --> 10:37.440]  as the most important issue right after 9-11
[10:37.440 --> 10:39.440]  for the American people.
[10:39.440 --> 10:41.440]  And it varies in the polls,
[10:41.440 --> 10:42.440]  but it's basically the same spread.
[10:42.440 --> 10:44.440]  You can pull those polls up.
[10:44.440 --> 10:45.440]  We've covered those.
[10:45.440 --> 10:47.440]  We can just search the term right now.
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.440]  10% of Americans think terror the greatest threat.
[10:50.440 --> 10:53.440]  That was a Gallup poll again, I think, three, four weeks ago.
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.440]  Now, so they're trying to rehabilitate it.
[10:57.440 --> 11:00.440]  They're trying to demonize 9-11 Truth.
[11:00.440 --> 11:03.440]  And they're reintroducing the idea
[11:03.440 --> 11:07.440]  that these attacks are imminent.
[11:07.440 --> 11:10.440]  And we have something even more important happening.
[11:10.440 --> 11:12.440]  The globalists are very arrogant.
[11:12.440 --> 11:14.440]  They think the public is completely stupid.
[11:14.440 --> 11:17.440]  There are a lot of self-absorbed, delusional people
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.440]  who literally don't even know who their neighbors are,
[11:20.440 --> 11:22.440]  where their state capital is,
[11:22.440 --> 11:24.440]  who don't know the three branches of government.
[11:24.440 --> 11:26.440]  But that's probably 25%, 30% of the public.
[11:26.440 --> 11:29.440]  Most people don't have a really tight grasp
[11:29.440 --> 11:31.440]  on what's happening historically,
[11:31.440 --> 11:33.440]  but they're starting to get a better one.
[11:33.440 --> 11:35.440]  And the system still goes ahead with its arrogance,
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.440]  this hubris that they are unstoppable
[11:39.440 --> 11:41.440]  and they can get away with anything.
[11:41.440 --> 11:43.440]  And so criminals like to brag.
[11:43.440 --> 11:45.440]  And so we've seen all these Democrats,
[11:45.440 --> 11:48.440]  all these Republicans, all these strategists,
[11:48.440 --> 11:50.440]  and I read a lot of these quotes yesterday,
[11:50.440 --> 11:53.440]  running around in the news media,
[11:53.440 --> 11:56.440]  like Robert Shapiro in the Financial Times of London,
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.440]  saying, look, Obama needs,
[12:00.440 --> 12:02.440]  there's the Hill newspaper poll,
[12:02.440 --> 12:04.440]  1% are terrorists,
[12:04.440 --> 12:09.440]  1% see terrorism as top problem.
[12:09.440 --> 12:14.440]  So 1% are obsessed with this fake manufactured crisis.
[12:14.440 --> 12:16.440]  But going back to what I was saying,
[12:16.440 --> 12:19.440]  I just wanted to pull that poll up for you to see it for yourself.
[12:19.440 --> 12:23.440]  They love to brag about what they're doing.
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.440]  And they love to openly, just thinly veil
[12:28.440 --> 12:31.440]  in public discussions, that's a big treat for them,
[12:31.440 --> 12:34.440]  that they are basically the terrorist.
[12:34.440 --> 12:36.440]  And they communicate with each other,
[12:36.440 --> 12:38.440]  if Obama doesn't have a major terror attack
[12:38.440 --> 12:40.440]  run by domestic groups,
[12:40.440 --> 12:42.440]  Allah, Oklahoma City,
[12:42.440 --> 12:44.440]  or another big al-Qaeda attack,
[12:44.440 --> 12:46.440]  his whole agenda is dead.
[12:46.440 --> 12:48.440]  If he can just get a terror attack,
[12:48.440 --> 12:50.440]  everything's going to be okay.
[12:50.440 --> 12:53.440]  And then Paul Watson's article he wrote about this back in July,
[12:53.440 --> 12:56.440]  that I read some passages from yesterday,
[12:56.440 --> 13:00.440]  it goes through quotes by the head of the Republican Party
[13:00.440 --> 13:03.440]  in a major state, top Republican strategists,
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.440]  top Republican columnist meetings
[13:07.440 --> 13:11.440]  in the Pentagon recorded and released with Rumsfeld
[13:11.440 --> 13:15.440]  and the top five Pentagon liaisons to the news networks
[13:15.440 --> 13:17.440]  saying, sir, without another attack,
[13:17.440 --> 13:19.440]  we're not going to get this agenda through.
[13:19.440 --> 13:21.440]  And Rumsfeld's like, I know, but it's hard.
[13:21.440 --> 13:23.440]  Let's not talk about this here.
[13:23.440 --> 13:25.440]  And we've played that before.
[13:25.440 --> 13:29.440]  And they're one inch, they're one inch
[13:29.440 --> 13:31.440]  from just coming right out.
[13:31.440 --> 13:34.440]  But of course, at these higher levels,
[13:34.440 --> 13:36.440]  that's how they commune with each other.
[13:36.440 --> 13:39.440]  You know, they're at the Pentagon and they're like, look, boss,
[13:39.440 --> 13:41.440]  without another attack, if we just had another,
[13:41.440 --> 13:43.440]  we could really get this agenda done.
[13:43.440 --> 13:47.440]  And remember all the bizarre headlines about 9-11 helped America.
[13:47.440 --> 13:49.440]  9-11 brought us together.
[13:49.440 --> 13:51.440]  And 9-11 was a good thing.
[13:51.440 --> 13:53.440]  And we sure need another one.
[13:53.440 --> 13:55.440]  And all the different reporters and columnists
[13:55.440 --> 13:57.440]  had had to apologize for saying that.
[13:57.440 --> 14:03.440]  And now Obama and another big signal came out
[14:03.440 --> 14:05.440]  just what two weeks ago and said,
[14:05.440 --> 14:07.440]  9-11 brought us together.
[14:07.440 --> 14:09.440]  9-11 made us stronger.
[14:09.440 --> 14:14.440]  And gee, I've tried to keep you safe from all these attacks.
[14:14.440 --> 14:17.440]  And his surrogates basically parroted the same thing
[14:17.440 --> 14:20.440]  and went on to say, you know, you wouldn't give all your rights up.
[14:20.440 --> 14:23.440]  So now Al-Qaeda is going to get you.
[14:23.440 --> 14:24.440]  That's right.
[14:24.440 --> 14:27.440]  And next time they hit, you're going to learn
[14:27.440 --> 14:29.440]  to not give us that line about civil liberties.
[14:29.440 --> 14:32.440]  And of course, it all mirrors Jack Bauer
[14:32.440 --> 14:36.440]  and that fiction program where he's always doing the tough thing
[14:36.440 --> 14:38.440]  to keep the people safe.
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.440]  And at the end of the day, we always learn he's right.
[14:41.440 --> 14:43.440]  And he's right about global warming.
[14:43.440 --> 14:46.440]  Jack Bauer's fighting it and a lot of conservatives said,
[14:46.440 --> 14:48.440]  well, maybe we should have a carbon tax.
[14:48.440 --> 14:50.440]  I mean, Jack Bauer's for it.
[14:50.440 --> 14:51.440]  Literally.
[14:51.440 --> 14:55.440]  And now bin Laden comes out and un-documented, you know,
[14:55.440 --> 14:56.440]  new audio tape.
[14:56.440 --> 14:59.440]  The government admits they put out fake bin Laden videos
[14:59.440 --> 15:02.440]  and says, you better pass carbon taxes or I'm going to bomb you.
[15:02.440 --> 15:05.440]  And the school kids are being taught this right now.
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.440]  You know, we better, we better do what bin Laden says
[15:08.440 --> 15:11.440]  or he'll get us, you know, even bin Laden knows
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.440]  that you should put a napkin in your lap when you have dinner.
[15:15.440 --> 15:18.440]  Even bin Laden knows you should brush your teeth twice a day.
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.440]  Even bin Laden knows to put your shoes and raincoat on
[15:22.440 --> 15:25.440]  when it's raining outside because you could get your death.
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.440]  I mean, even bin Laden knows global warming is real.
[15:29.440 --> 15:31.440]  Or I'm sorry, climate change.
[15:31.440 --> 15:37.440]  I was listening to the simpering snake-like scripted voices of MPR
[15:37.440 --> 15:41.440]  where everything's nice and sweet and it was all about terrorists
[15:41.440 --> 15:45.440]  are going to attack us and we've got to give our rights up
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.440]  and climate change is a bigger threat than ever.
[15:48.440 --> 15:51.440]  Just a year ago, it was global warming, but we exposed that as a fraud
[15:51.440 --> 15:53.440]  and the earth's actually getting cooler.
[15:53.440 --> 15:57.440]  Now it's climate change, just pay Al Gore some money
[15:57.440 --> 16:00.440]  and he will fix everything for you.
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.440]  Don't you worry your little pretty heads about anything.
[16:04.440 --> 16:07.440]  Thank goodness we've got a Pentagon stealing trillions
[16:07.440 --> 16:09.440]  and they won't say where it's gone.
[16:09.440 --> 16:11.440]  They're doing that to protect us from al-Qaeda.
[16:11.440 --> 16:13.440]  Thank goodness the Pentagon admits they're growing
[16:13.440 --> 16:15.440]  the majority of the opium in Afghanistan
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.440]  because if they don't, somebody else like al-Qaeda
[16:19.440 --> 16:22.440]  will grow it and get that money.
[16:22.440 --> 16:26.440]  And thank goodness the CIA puts out fake bin Laden videos and brags about it.
[16:26.440 --> 16:29.440]  They're just reminding us of how evil bin Laden is,
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.440]  the admitted CIA asset codenamed Tim Osmond.
[16:33.440 --> 16:37.440]  And then that brings me obviously to the latest hype.
[16:37.440 --> 16:40.440]  Here we are, early October,
[16:40.440 --> 16:49.440]  a month out from the historic 2010 off-year election
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.440]  and the Democrats and Republicans are together in the war on terror.
[16:55.440 --> 16:58.440]  They are together at the leadership level.
[16:58.440 --> 17:01.440]  We've got to accept naked body scanners and troops on the street.
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.440]  We've got to have Homeland Security focused on returning veterans and gun owners.
[17:05.440 --> 17:10.440]  We've got to have Israeli companies spying on members of the House of Representatives
[17:10.440 --> 17:14.440]  in Pennsylvania and every other major state that's come out.
[17:14.440 --> 17:19.440]  We've got to have FEMA within LE09 with Israeli and Dutch and French
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.440]  and other foreign intelligence agencies spying.
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.440]  The Pentagon and NATO have to hire former Stasi chiefs.
[17:26.440 --> 17:29.440]  That was in Der Spiegel again last week to help set up this grid
[17:29.440 --> 17:32.440]  because after all, the Stasi were the good guys.
[17:32.440 --> 17:34.440]  They were fighting terror.
[17:34.440 --> 17:38.440]  They were fighting people that weren't politically correct,
[17:38.440 --> 17:41.440]  people that made homophobic statements.
[17:41.440 --> 17:47.440]  I just can't believe that anyone would ever criticize the Stasi.
[17:47.440 --> 17:50.440]  What have we become?
[17:50.440 --> 17:53.440]  I can't believe there's some Americans that actually think
[17:53.440 --> 17:57.440]  the greatest police state in world history, the Stasi, were bad.
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.440]  Homeland Security's obviously good hiring them eight years ago.
[18:01.440 --> 18:04.440]  NATO's obviously good hiring them.
[18:04.440 --> 18:07.440]  The public schools training children to spy on their parents
[18:07.440 --> 18:16.440]  and obviously freedom. It's to keep us safe from men that wear turbines and pajamas.
[18:16.440 --> 18:19.440]  One's easier. I mean, they're going to get us, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:19.440 --> 18:22.440]  Do you understand how much threat we're under?
[18:22.440 --> 18:25.440]  It's not the banks stealing trillions and they won't tell Congress where the money went.
[18:25.440 --> 18:27.440]  It's not the Pentagon admitting four trillions missing
[18:27.440 --> 18:30.440]  and they won't tell Congress where it went. That's good.
[18:30.440 --> 18:32.440]  It's not the face scanning cameras.
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.440]  It's not the government taking your blood secretly at birth for 39 years
[18:35.440 --> 18:38.440]  It's not them taking blood at DMVs now in DC.
[18:38.440 --> 18:41.440]  It's not warrantless checkpoints taking blood.
[18:41.440 --> 18:44.440]  None of that is a threat.
[18:44.440 --> 18:48.440]  It's not tenfold increase in convulsions from the flu shot admitted.
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.440]  That's good. Narcolepsy is good.
[18:52.440 --> 18:56.440]  Brain damage is good. They're trying to help you.
[18:56.440 --> 19:00.440]  So what if the major GMO corn causes organ failure across the board
[19:00.440 --> 19:03.440]  and all rodent species? That's good.
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.440]  So what if there's 300,000 plus drug interaction deaths every year
[19:07.440 --> 19:12.440]  and over 200,000 infections that kill people with the superbugs in the hospitals?
[19:12.440 --> 19:14.440]  That's not a threat.
[19:14.440 --> 19:18.440]  You saw the buildings blow up. It was scary.
[19:18.440 --> 19:21.440]  You saw the media there with their cameras trained in the morning
[19:21.440 --> 19:23.440]  to get that news cycle just right.
[19:23.440 --> 19:25.440]  You saw them hit that hole in one.
[19:25.440 --> 19:28.440]  So what if there's video, a cop saying, get back.
[19:28.440 --> 19:30.440]  They're going to blow up building seven.
[19:30.440 --> 19:33.440]  Before that, they had to blow it up.
[19:33.440 --> 19:35.440]  You could have hurt somebody. Come on.
[19:35.440 --> 19:37.440]  Let's not discuss it.
[19:37.440 --> 19:43.440]  What matters right now is the terrorists have already chosen their targets in Europe.
[19:43.440 --> 19:48.440]  And I'm afraid. I'm afraid of the monsters.
[19:48.440 --> 19:51.440]  The men with turbines are coming.
[19:51.440 --> 19:57.440]  Thank goodness Barack Hussein Obama is there to be my daddy.
[19:57.440 --> 20:00.440]  Keep me safe at night.
[20:58.440 --> 21:04.440]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[24:23.440 --> 24:29.440]  We are back live. Thank you for joining us on this Monday, October 4th transmission.
[24:29.440 --> 24:32.440]  Okay, getting into the really serious news.
[24:32.440 --> 24:36.440]  You know about what happened Friday and over the weekend repeatedly.
[24:36.440 --> 24:41.440]  Taliban attacks NATO supply trucks in Pakistan.
[24:41.440 --> 24:43.440]  Who knows if that is staged or not.
[24:43.440 --> 24:47.440]  There is certainly a real war going on there by people that don't want to be occupied.
[24:47.440 --> 24:54.440]  As they expand the war into Pakistan, the Pakistani Taliban claim responsibility Monday
[24:54.440 --> 24:58.440]  for a pre-dawn attack on tankers carrying fuel to Afghanistan for the U.S.
[24:58.440 --> 25:02.440]  and other NATO forces left vulnerable on the side of the road
[25:02.440 --> 25:06.440]  after Pakistan shut down a key border crossing.
[25:06.440 --> 25:10.440]  So that is unfolding right now.
[25:10.440 --> 25:19.440]  Meanwhile, airport lobbies, possible terror targets in European plot officials say.
[25:19.440 --> 25:25.440]  And this is just further hyping up what Homeland Security has been saying Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.440]  that they have the intel that they were unable to stop the terror groups.
[25:29.440 --> 25:36.440]  They're in Europe right now and preparing to go into the airports before the security checkpoints
[25:36.440 --> 25:39.440]  and shoot people and throw hand grenades.
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.440]  Of course, they have a lot of popular video games that have come out the last few years
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.440]  where you can pose as Russian terrorists who go in and run a false flag attacking airports.
[25:49.440 --> 25:54.440]  And we're going to be going back to that little historical piece in a moment.
[25:54.440 --> 25:58.440]  New game lets players massacre civilians.
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.440]  A new video game allows players to pose as Russian, ultra-nationalist terrorists
[26:02.440 --> 26:05.440]  and massacre civilians with assault weapons in an airport.
[26:05.440 --> 26:11.440]  And of course, it's really a false flag attack and we're showing some video of that on screen.
[26:11.440 --> 26:14.440]  So this is the type of attack they're talking about.
[26:14.440 --> 26:19.440]  And of course, their answer is, hire Israeli companies to now set up more checkpoints
[26:19.440 --> 26:26.440]  as you get to the airport and have three layers total before you get to the main checkpoints
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.440]  and then after the checkpoints at the gate again.
[26:30.440 --> 26:34.440]  And then these security companies will make billions of dollars globally.
[26:34.440 --> 26:38.440]  You have Big Sis, Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security,
[26:38.440 --> 26:43.440]  Italy and others announced they're going to pull the naked body scanners out after the trials.
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.440]  She came in and said, we'll give you money.
[26:45.440 --> 26:46.440]  We'll do whatever you want.
[26:46.440 --> 26:48.440]  Taxpayer money. Just put them in.
[26:48.440 --> 26:50.440]  Don't let this fail.
[26:50.440 --> 26:53.440]  We're going to put these in malls, street corners, mobile vans.
[26:53.440 --> 26:56.440]  They're already going in state and federal courthouses.
[26:56.440 --> 26:58.440]  We're radiating people.
[26:58.440 --> 27:00.440]  We're making billions and billions a month off this.
[27:00.440 --> 27:03.440]  If you adopt it, please, no.
[27:03.440 --> 27:04.440]  We've got to have it.
[27:04.440 --> 27:07.440]  And right on time, okay, the terrorists are going to attack.
[27:07.440 --> 27:14.440]  And the FBI has said they want these scanners at major bus terminals but also shopping malls.
[27:14.440 --> 27:21.440]  See, you think you just won't fly and you'll get away with having some privacy and not being surveilled?
[27:21.440 --> 27:23.440]  No, you're going to be surveilled.
[27:23.440 --> 27:25.440]  And they're going to have mobile trucks.
[27:25.440 --> 27:30.440]  They do have them driving around, frying your home while you're in it.
[27:30.440 --> 27:36.440]  Airport lobbies, possible terror targets in European plot, officials, not a servant,
[27:36.440 --> 27:43.440]  but an official said among the possible targets in the suspected European terror plot are pre-security areas.
[27:43.440 --> 27:49.440]  At at least five major European airports, a law enforcement official told ABC News.
[27:49.440 --> 27:57.440]  Authorities, officials, authorities believe terror teams are preparing the mount to commando-like attack,
[27:57.440 --> 28:04.440]  featuring small units and small firearms modeled after the Mumbai attack two years ago.
[28:04.440 --> 28:06.440]  Funny, I have that headline.
[28:06.440 --> 28:09.440]  Head of Mumbai attack was U.S. agent.
[28:09.440 --> 28:10.440]  Let's put that in the search engine.
[28:10.440 --> 28:12.440]  It was in Chicago Tribune and others.
[28:12.440 --> 28:14.440]  Let's show folks that.
[28:14.440 --> 28:17.440]  Meanwhile, they have all these video games about this happening.
[28:17.440 --> 28:27.440]  And one year before the attack on South Ossetia and Abkhazia in northern Georgia run by NATO on record,
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.440]  and they ran a hoax on our news thing Russia had attacked, Hal Ashanine.
[28:31.440 --> 28:37.440]  And later they had to retract that three days later, but it's just amazing that some still go along with that hoax.
[28:37.440 --> 28:45.440]  They had a major video game where there's a war over South Ossetia in Georgia with Russia and NATO.
[28:45.440 --> 28:47.440]  They just love to throw it in your face.
[28:47.440 --> 28:53.440]  But continuing, the State Department issued a highly unusual travel alert Sunday for potential terror attacks in Europe,
[28:53.440 --> 29:01.440]  showing U.S. citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorist attacks and public transportation systems and other terrorist infrastructure.
[29:01.440 --> 29:11.440]  More Americans per capita are now dying every year on the Texas-Mexico border and other border states than dying terror attacks.
[29:11.440 --> 29:17.440]  But you never really see that being hyped up, or 28,000 dead in the border region the last three years.
[29:17.440 --> 29:22.440]  And the fact that the State Department quietly lists Mexico as the most dangerous country in the world now.
[29:22.440 --> 29:29.440]  That's, no, it's, there might be an attack on an airport where they'll have guns like Mumbai.
[29:29.440 --> 29:37.440]  We're going to come back, finish up with this, because it integrates into audit.
[29:37.440 --> 29:42.440]  Changes needed to make nuke plants more secure. And remember that story a listener pointed out?
[29:42.440 --> 29:50.440]  Effingham deputies call feds after arresting Russians with shovel wire cutters outside Georgia power plant.
[29:50.440 --> 30:00.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.440 --> 30:08.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[30:08.440 --> 30:13.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[30:13.440 --> 30:19.440]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[30:19.440 --> 30:24.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[30:24.440 --> 30:34.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[30:34.440 --> 30:41.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[30:41.440 --> 30:48.440]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[30:48.440 --> 30:59.440]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[31:19.440 --> 31:24.440]  Number three. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:24.440 --> 31:28.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:28.440 --> 31:35.440]  Number four. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[31:35.440 --> 31:40.440]  Number five. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:40.440 --> 31:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[31:45.440 --> 31:51.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[31:51.440 --> 31:59.440]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[31:59.440 --> 32:03.440]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[32:03.440 --> 32:10.440]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family owned and operated American company.
[32:10.440 --> 32:17.440]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[32:17.440 --> 32:22.440]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.
[32:22.440 --> 32:31.440]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at fivestarsoap.com or infowars.com.
[32:31.440 --> 32:35.440]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[32:35.440 --> 32:42.440]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[32:42.440 --> 32:46.440]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[32:46.440 --> 32:58.440]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website, fivestarsoap.com, for buying a one to two month soap sampler.
[32:58.440 --> 32:59.440]  Thank you.
[32:59.440 --> 33:05.440]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[33:05.440 --> 33:08.440]  Why? No man is obsolete?
[33:08.440 --> 33:13.440]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth. You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time.
[33:13.440 --> 33:18.440]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[33:18.440 --> 33:26.440]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect, an ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning.
[33:26.440 --> 33:35.440]  I am a human being. Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like a wind.
[33:35.440 --> 33:40.440]  I don't care. I tell you, I don't care. I'm a human being. I exist.
[33:40.440 --> 33:47.440]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[33:47.440 --> 33:58.440]  Illusions, Mr. Wordsworth, the illusions that you injected in your veins to make you think you have a strength when you have no strength at all.
[33:58.440 --> 34:05.440]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the strength has no use for your kind.
[34:05.440 --> 34:20.440]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[34:20.440 --> 34:24.440]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us.
[34:24.440 --> 34:28.440]  Coming up in the first 30 minutes of the next hour, I'm going to get back into this top story.
[34:28.440 --> 34:38.440]  We're going to read through some of the Obama administration advisors and officials saying back in July, we need a big terror attack by a domestic group or by Muslims,
[34:38.440 --> 34:46.440]  or the threat of one as a pretext to clamp down on the American people and to have folks basically worship Obama and see him as strong.
[34:46.440 --> 34:51.440]  And Michael Savage has even come out and said he believes that the Obama people may stage false flags.
[34:51.440 --> 35:03.440]  So it's not just Alex Jones talking about this. We have these very individuals out in the open getting to all of this.
[35:03.440 --> 35:14.440]  And we have this ABC News report, Utah residents fear Israeli art students prying into NSA data center,
[35:14.440 --> 35:21.440]  and they're reporting that they keep coming to people's doors in and around the new facility, showing their art students trying to sell them art,
[35:21.440 --> 35:27.440]  but then asking them if they know about the NSA facility. And that's because then if somebody says, yeah, I work there and my husband does,
[35:27.440 --> 35:33.440]  they can pump them for info or even pay them. That's how on the ground infiltration works.
[35:33.440 --> 35:43.440]  And right before 9-11, and it gets into the AP and salon articles about this, there were all these Israeli art students penetrating the DEA offices,
[35:43.440 --> 35:47.440]  the Pentagon, the Department of Defense and other law enforcement agencies.
[35:47.440 --> 35:56.440]  This is not a raw story, but it's local ABC News affiliate ABC 4 with Brent Hunsaker reporting on it.
[35:56.440 --> 36:02.440]  And then we have this report to the listener pointed out of a regular coal powered plant.
[36:02.440 --> 36:10.440]  Effingham deputies call feds after arresting Russians with shovel wire cutters outside Georgia power plant.
[36:10.440 --> 36:15.440]  And we've got this up on prisonplanet.tv. They're mug shots. If you scroll down, you can see these guys.
[36:15.440 --> 36:23.440]  I mean, they look like special forces spy types. They do not look like your regular tourist.
[36:23.440 --> 36:29.440]  I mean, they've got spook written all over them. Just look at those eyes. Just look at these guys.
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.440]  Young special forces types. And the feds ordered them released.
[36:34.440 --> 36:42.440]  And same thing with the Israelis in other cases. But speaking of that, here's the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
[36:42.440 --> 36:50.440]  Pennsylvania Homeland Security Chief quits. And we're going to be discussing that now with State Representative from Pennsylvania,
[36:50.440 --> 36:57.440]  Darrell Metcalf, who's organized a Second Amendment rally, Tea Party, lower tax rallies.
[36:57.440 --> 37:06.440]  They got surveilled by this Israeli company that admits their Mossad connected. They were paid 125,000 to spy on his group.
[37:06.440 --> 37:10.440]  And they've now had state Homeland Security hearings on this.
[37:10.440 --> 37:16.440]  And the head of Homeland Security, a former federal Homeland Security individual with the U.S. Special Forces,
[37:16.440 --> 37:22.440]  has resigned over this. And there's criminal investigations, civil investigations.
[37:22.440 --> 37:27.440]  The media is reporting, again, Pennsylvania Homeland Security Chief quits.
[37:27.440 --> 37:32.440]  Here's another one. Second Amendment group made terror threat list in Pennsylvania.
[37:32.440 --> 37:37.440]  Cranberry lawmaker asked why his rallies made terror list. That's Darrell Metcalf.
[37:37.440 --> 37:47.440]  House to vote on Stan your ground gun bill today will also get his take on that interesting Second Amendment legislation in Pennsylvania.
[37:47.440 --> 37:53.440]  Remember, this is going on all over the country. And it's not just Israelis. It's British. It's others.
[37:53.440 --> 37:57.440]  And this country is wide open for foreigners to come in and spy on us.
[37:57.440 --> 38:03.440]  But if you, as a citizen, spied on people like this, should be arrested for wiretapping,
[38:03.440 --> 38:10.440]  Darrell Metcalf is recognized by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette as Pennsylvania's General Assembly's number one conservative
[38:10.440 --> 38:14.440]  and multi-time highest ranking lawmaker on the Pennsylvania Liberty Index.
[38:14.440 --> 38:19.440]  He also heads up state legislators for legal immigration.com.
[38:19.440 --> 38:27.440]  He's the founder and he joins us. He represents District 12. Good to have you here with us again, sir.
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.440]  Good to be with you again, Alex. Thanks for having me today.
[38:29.440 --> 38:34.440]  Well, a lot has happened. Recap what originally was discovered,
[38:34.440 --> 38:37.440]  what you've since discovered in the hearings and where all of this is going.
[38:37.440 --> 38:45.440]  Right, right. It came out sometime back that this Institute of Terrorism Research and Response that admits on our website
[38:45.440 --> 38:53.440]  that connections with Israeli defense that they were actually contracted by the Pennsylvania Homeland Security
[38:53.440 --> 39:00.440]  and were issuing bulletins regarding events that were taking place or planned around the state of Pennsylvania.
[39:00.440 --> 39:07.440]  That information became public and more and more details were made available.
[39:07.440 --> 39:14.440]  We became aware that a couple of the rallies that I organized, both for Second Amendment and also for taxpayers
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.440]  to voice their concerns about increased spending and increased taxes in the state of Pennsylvania
[39:18.440 --> 39:25.440]  were two events that were listed in these bulletins that they were looking at as far as elevating
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.440]  the possible chance of having some terrorist activity occurring.
[39:30.440 --> 39:36.440]  So when this became evident and became reported on more and more, the Senate called for hearings
[39:36.440 --> 39:41.440]  out of their Senate Veterans Affairs Emergency Preparedness Committee.
[39:41.440 --> 39:47.440]  Senator Baker chaired that hearing last Monday and I had one of my staff at the hearing.
[39:47.440 --> 39:53.440]  I live about four hours from Harrisburg. I wasn't at the hearing in the morning on Monday before our session started,
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.440]  but I had one of my staff there and it was very evident from the testimony that was given
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.440]  from the Pennsylvania State Police, the Director of the Homeland Security here in Pennsylvania,
[40:03.440 --> 40:09.440]  the Pennsylvania State Homeland Security Department, and also our PEMA, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Association,
[40:09.440 --> 40:18.440]  that there was conflicting testimony given. The state police seemed to strongly disagree with information
[40:18.440 --> 40:23.440]  that was being put forth by the Director of our Homeland Security here in Pennsylvania at that time
[40:23.440 --> 40:32.440]  and by PEMA that they, in fact, had told the governor's office that they were on top of any dangers to Pennsylvanians.
[40:32.440 --> 40:39.440]  And during that time, Director Powers moved forward with contracting this Israeli connected company,
[40:39.440 --> 40:44.440]  the Institute of Terrorism Research and Response. They tried to claim that the state police
[40:44.440 --> 40:48.440]  said they didn't have the resources to take care of dealing with those types of threats
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.440]  that would be notified through this Institute. The state police disagreed with that testimony.
[40:54.440 --> 41:00.440]  So, you know, as things percolated through the week last week, I had sent a letter the week prior
[41:00.440 --> 41:05.440]  asking a series of questions to the Director of our Homeland Security in Pennsylvania as to
[41:05.440 --> 41:11.440]  what was done with this information with surveillance launched on the rallies that I had participated in
[41:11.440 --> 41:17.440]  and had organized, actually, where wiretaps initiated, if so, by, you know, on whom,
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.440]  where any of the people involved with the, you know, working with me on these rallies,
[41:21.440 --> 41:24.440]  a target of their surveillance, was I a target of their surveillance.
[41:24.440 --> 41:31.440]  We've since, so that time, worked with our legal counsel to draft right to no request that would be filed this week
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.440]  and our Homeland Security Director here in Pennsylvania announced his resignation last Friday.
[41:36.440 --> 41:42.440]  The governor of Pennsylvania seems to still stand by the director of that department,
[41:42.440 --> 41:47.440]  even though he claims he wasn't standing by these bulletins or the contracting of this company.
[41:47.440 --> 41:53.440]  But if he, in fact, didn't agree with this, he should have fired the director instead of letting the director
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.440]  weasel out of his role here by resigning last week.
[41:57.440 --> 42:00.440]  I think there's still questions that have to be answered by Pima.
[42:00.440 --> 42:05.440]  There's still questions that should be investigated by our attorney general and by the state police
[42:05.440 --> 42:11.440]  regarding what was done here that infringed upon the rights of law-abiding citizens in Pennsylvania.
[42:11.440 --> 42:18.440]  Yeah, let's boil this down. You've got this Homeland Security head of the state,
[42:18.440 --> 42:23.440]  State Homeland Security Director James F. Powers Jr.
[42:23.440 --> 42:32.440]  and you've got all these other individuals not wanting to release, you know, more information
[42:32.440 --> 42:35.440]  on exactly what's happening in the state.
[42:35.440 --> 42:44.440]  But bottom line, we know an Israeli company was out there spying on political groups across the board
[42:44.440 --> 42:50.440]  and all of this needs to be released at least to the state committees
[42:50.440 --> 42:53.440]  and I think there needs to be a criminal investigation.
[42:53.440 --> 42:59.440]  I would agree and I think the state police had testified that due to these bulletins
[42:59.440 --> 43:02.440]  that were being issued through the Pennsylvania Homeland Security
[43:02.440 --> 43:06.440]  that they ended up chasing fires around and that it was irresponsible reporting
[43:06.440 --> 43:12.440]  that in fact this institute was not vetting the information that they were releasing properly,
[43:12.440 --> 43:16.440]  that they were very irresponsible in the way that they were releasing the information
[43:16.440 --> 43:19.440]  to local law enforcement, law enforcement around Pennsylvania
[43:19.440 --> 43:28.440]  and just such an irresponsible way that they were trying to actually take care of what they were contracted for
[43:28.440 --> 43:34.440]  when even the initial contract should have been under question that they would actually contract someone
[43:34.440 --> 43:37.440]  that would start to launch these types of...
[43:37.440 --> 43:45.440]  Well, number one, this is secret police activity and smacks of each Germany or Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany
[43:45.440 --> 43:51.440]  or Maoist China, but if it's going to be going on, you know, it's one thing if it's the state police
[43:51.440 --> 43:55.440]  because they're accountable to the legislature and they're from here.
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.440]  But when you find out then it's foreign groups doing it
[43:59.440 --> 44:04.440]  and Israel's got this big history of espionage in the U.S. and the ADL and others
[44:04.440 --> 44:07.440]  caught infiltrating police departments in the past.
[44:07.440 --> 44:14.440]  Clearly this is an infiltration operation, but the federal Homeland Security's fully infiltrated
[44:14.440 --> 44:22.440]  so this seems to be par for the course and now we have ABC News 4 and others out of Utah
[44:22.440 --> 44:28.440]  reporting that the Israeli art students have popped back up asking about the NSA Center being built in the area
[44:28.440 --> 44:32.440]  in the neighborhoods around it trying to get humet on the ground.
[44:32.440 --> 44:37.440]  I mean, look, I'm no rocket science when it comes to intelligence and counterintelligence,
[44:37.440 --> 44:43.440]  but this is classical infiltration going on and it's coming from a law enforcement perspective.
[44:43.440 --> 44:45.440]  I mean, this is amazing.
[44:45.440 --> 44:54.440]  And the infiltration was fully embraced by officials here in Pennsylvania
[44:54.440 --> 44:58.440]  and our state government that were appointed and hired by our governor's administration.
[44:58.440 --> 45:03.440]  Our governor has been known to say one thing and then do another
[45:03.440 --> 45:07.440]  and the man has been caught in one lie after another while he's been in office.
[45:07.440 --> 45:13.440]  He'd come out and was reported that Rindell had terminated the contract
[45:13.440 --> 45:16.440]  and violated citizens' rights for lawful constitutional protests.
[45:16.440 --> 45:20.440]  That was reported that he'd terminated the contract and then more information comes out.
[45:20.440 --> 45:24.440]  Now the contract really hadn't been terminated, they just weren't going to renew at the end of October
[45:24.440 --> 45:29.440]  and this company was being paid the full amount of money that they're initially contracted for
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.440]  even after turning out all of this bogus information and enlisting law-abiding citizens
[45:34.440 --> 45:40.440]  who were actually protesting and maybe not allowed in other parts of the world to do what we've been doing
[45:40.440 --> 45:45.440]  but fully under the God-given rights that are affirmed in our constitution
[45:45.440 --> 45:52.440]  that we have a right to do what these folks were doing and then being listed as being a potential terrorist.
[45:52.440 --> 45:56.440]  And to be clear, we're talking to State Representative Darrell Metcalf of Pennsylvania.
[45:56.440 --> 46:03.440]  Now correct me if I'm wrong with reading these reports, only a fraction of their activities has been leaked
[46:03.440 --> 46:11.440]  and so we better believe if one State Representative and Main Line Second Amendment groups and Main Line Tea Party
[46:11.440 --> 46:16.440]  folks that want to balance budget are being spied on and listed as potential terrorists
[46:16.440 --> 46:20.440]  and threats to infrastructure, this is going to be a lot more widespread.
[46:20.440 --> 46:26.440]  Well that's exactly right, I think we've just seen the tip of the iceberg as that old cliche goes
[46:26.440 --> 46:36.440]  but I think every American has to really see a red flag go up when they hear of this type of activity taken
[46:36.440 --> 46:43.440]  by an administration, be it Pennsylvania or the Randell's administration, the Pennsylvania government
[46:43.440 --> 46:49.440]  or the Obama administration at the federal level, that when you're going to start having taxpayer resources,
[46:49.440 --> 46:58.440]  taxpayer paid public servants spying, surveilling, looking into the activities of law-abiding citizens.
[46:58.440 --> 47:03.440]  I mean there's enough criminals on the streets that they should be utilizing every resource we have
[47:03.440 --> 47:10.440]  to go after those MS-13 gangs and the drug cartels and the gangs that are committing violent acts
[47:10.440 --> 47:16.440]  against our citizens daily in every city in this country, that they turn around and use those resources,
[47:16.440 --> 47:21.440]  those limited resources to target law-abiding citizens in the process of violating our rights.
[47:21.440 --> 47:33.440]  I mean it just really reeks of that tyrannical type of oppression, that tyrannical type of intimidation
[47:33.440 --> 47:39.440]  that you'd mentioned from Eastern European countries before the Cold War came to an end.
[47:39.440 --> 47:45.440]  But even in Eastern European countries, if foreigners were brought in to be the secret police,
[47:45.440 --> 47:52.440]  no one would put up with this and I've seen in press reports dealing with the Total Information Awareness Network
[47:52.440 --> 47:58.440]  and a lot of this spying and data mining, it is foreign companies that are running it and doing it
[47:58.440 --> 48:05.440]  and that came out in the FEMA in LE09 drills that intelligence agencies from 14 countries
[48:05.440 --> 48:11.440]  were helping run drills against, quote, domestic terrorists and then you find out that domestic terrorists
[48:11.440 --> 48:16.440]  are people that say, hey, my taxes are too high or hey, you're not getting my guns or hey,
[48:16.440 --> 48:23.440]  I don't want government-run health care or hey, I don't agree with the FCC diversity desire
[48:23.440 --> 48:26.440]  praising censorship like Hugo Chavez does.
[48:26.440 --> 48:32.440]  I think we need to really recognize that the government's having to contract with foreign groups
[48:32.440 --> 48:36.440]  because what they're doing is criminal and they've got to keep this covered up.
[48:36.440 --> 48:44.440]  I mean, you can't get much worse than foreign military connected groups spying on citizens
[48:44.440 --> 48:50.440]  and then they look at you like you got three heads because you're demanding to find out the full extent.
[48:50.440 --> 48:54.440]  How do we find out exactly how bad this really was?
[48:54.440 --> 49:00.440]  That's exactly right. I think the individuals involved in this and some of the things that you just listed,
[49:00.440 --> 49:09.440]  whether it's Ed Rendell and Obama's disdain and total disrespect for their constitutional rights
[49:09.440 --> 49:18.440]  of law-abiding American citizens to actually execute their right to bear arms, their right to free speech.
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.440]  I mean, these people are globalists in their thinking.
[49:22.440 --> 49:26.440]  I mean, they look at themselves as world citizens, not American citizens.
[49:26.440 --> 49:28.440]  They're authoritarian tyrants.
[49:28.440 --> 49:34.440]  And they embrace these socialist leftist policies of the Eastern Bloc nations
[49:34.440 --> 49:39.440]  that when I was in the military, we were prepared to go to war against when it went during the Cold War.
[49:39.440 --> 49:47.440]  You know, the Warsaw Pact nations, I mean, that type of tyrannical governance is what these types of people.
[49:47.440 --> 49:52.440]  Ed Rendell, I mean, his wife, you know, I wrote an article on his wife being interviewed,
[49:52.440 --> 49:58.440]  the federal judge talking about having a benevolent dictator would be a good thing
[49:58.440 --> 50:00.440]  because then we could get some of these health care issues and guns.
[50:00.440 --> 50:04.440]  Oh, we've heard this from hundreds of Obama supporters.
[50:04.440 --> 50:05.440]  Right.
[50:05.440 --> 50:08.440]  I mean, Woody Allen, I mean, the list goes on and on.
[50:08.440 --> 50:11.440]  They're just constantly saying, we need a dictator.
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.440]  Well, that's where they come from.
[50:13.440 --> 50:19.440]  And that's why they're not slow to embrace hiring somebody like this Israeli connected company
[50:19.440 --> 50:24.440]  that was working with our State Department here to surveil and issue these types of reports
[50:24.440 --> 50:27.440]  to spy on American citizens, law-abiding citizens.
[50:27.440 --> 50:33.440]  And I think, you know, our activities here now as far as trying to push for an answer
[50:33.440 --> 50:39.440]  is to continue to press now the Pima secretary who's still in place that hasn't resigned yet.
[50:39.440 --> 50:42.440]  And it sounds like he was, you know, joined at the hip with the...
[50:42.440 --> 50:44.440]  I tell you what, stay there, sir, a little bit longer.
[50:44.440 --> 50:45.440]  We appreciate your time.
[50:45.440 --> 50:48.440]  We'll give out the websites on the other side about where this investigation is going.
[50:48.440 --> 50:54.440]  How my listeners and others, especially in Pennsylvania, can really get a true investigation going
[50:54.440 --> 50:56.440]  to break open this barrel of snakes.
[50:56.440 --> 51:25.440]  We'll be right back.
[51:26.440 --> 51:55.440]  We'll be right back.
[51:56.440 --> 51:59.440]  This is not your father's Biowar survival handbook.
[51:59.440 --> 52:04.440]  You may be arrested and are subject to other police action.
[52:04.440 --> 52:05.440]  Tyranny is here.
[52:05.440 --> 52:09.440]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[52:09.440 --> 52:11.440]  It really says that the state is God.
[52:11.440 --> 52:17.440]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[52:17.440 --> 52:24.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[52:24.440 --> 52:30.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[52:30.440 --> 52:34.440]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[52:34.440 --> 52:38.440]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[52:38.440 --> 52:44.440]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[52:44.440 --> 52:48.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[52:48.440 --> 52:50.440]  The police state isn't coming.
[52:50.440 --> 52:51.440]  It's here.

[54:04.440 --> 54:07.440]  He may have to leave early though because they're about to go back into session and voting.
[54:07.440 --> 54:10.440]  They're in Pennsylvania Representative Darrell Metcalf.
[54:10.440 --> 54:13.440]  Sir, look, there's a lot of other angles to this.
[54:13.440 --> 54:16.440]  And one big one is defamation.
[54:16.440 --> 54:21.440]  To have them secretly demonizing you, demonizing an elected representative,
[54:21.440 --> 54:25.440]  mainline Second Amendment groups, mainline anti-war groups,
[54:25.440 --> 54:28.440]  mainline groups that don't want gas pipelines in their backyard,
[54:28.440 --> 54:31.440]  whether you agree with them or not, they've got their right.
[54:31.440 --> 54:39.440]  And what about a defamation angle, a civil operation if the legislature blocks a true investigation?
[54:39.440 --> 54:44.440]  I mean, this is a big deal. We've got to stop these foreign secret police.
[54:44.440 --> 54:53.440]  I agree with you and I know there's citizens that are looking at their various options
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.440]  that they can pursue to try and investigate this further, get more information,
[54:57.440 --> 55:01.440]  and really kind of bring the hammer down on this type of activity that has happened
[55:01.440 --> 55:03.440]  and has stopped from happening in the future.
[55:03.440 --> 55:09.440]  From the legislative side, I've talked to our staff with our Veterans Affairs Emergency Preparedness Committee
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.440]  and have asked for our chief of staff there from our director of that committee
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.440]  for his help in pursuing this further with trying to work with the Senate
[55:17.440 --> 55:21.440]  to really try and ferret out the answers to the various questions that are out there
[55:21.440 --> 55:22.440]  because there's a lot of questions.
[55:22.440 --> 55:26.440]  There's a lot of information that we still need to find out what really happened there.
[55:26.440 --> 55:29.440]  The only way to prevent something like this from happening in the future
[55:29.440 --> 55:32.440]  is to fully understand what just happened and how it happened
[55:32.440 --> 55:37.440]  and to prevent any future governor or administration or rogue administration
[55:37.440 --> 55:43.440]  from embracing this type of activity that really reeks of tyrannical activity
[55:43.440 --> 55:49.440]  that people have ultimately died under in foreign countries in the past
[55:49.440 --> 55:51.440]  and we don't want to see that happen in America.
[55:51.440 --> 55:53.440]  We have God-given rights that are affirmed in our Constitution
[55:53.440 --> 55:56.440]  and we need to stand up for those and that's what we're going to be doing.
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.440]  Well, this is an attack on the heart of the First Amendment and the Second Amendment
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.440]  enlisting you guys as potential terrorists and spying on citizens.
[56:04.440 --> 56:06.440]  And I noticed the flip-flopping that you mentioned.
[56:06.440 --> 56:09.440]  First, the governor apologized and said, oh, this is terrible.
[56:09.440 --> 56:11.440]  Now the governor's in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review,
[56:11.440 --> 56:15.440]  along with the disgraced former head of state homeland security,
[56:15.440 --> 56:22.440]  blaming you guys saying he stepped down because of the distraction you guys posed,
[56:22.440 --> 56:24.440]  criticizing them.
[56:24.440 --> 56:27.440]  See, that might let the terrorist, which I guess is you, get them.
[56:27.440 --> 56:30.440]  Well, see, I think Rendell knew about this.
[56:30.440 --> 56:32.440]  I think Rendell approved of it.
[56:32.440 --> 56:35.440]  I think if he didn't approve it, and if he didn't know of it,
[56:35.440 --> 56:37.440]  then he should have fired powers.
[56:37.440 --> 56:41.440]  I think that this was just the powers of the scapegoat for this administration's
[56:41.440 --> 56:45.440]  continued abuse in disregard for the law in the Constitution.
[56:45.440 --> 56:48.440]  The governor's had a track record of that for the last seven years.
[56:48.440 --> 56:52.440]  We're finally going to get rid of him because of term limits in Pennsylvania at the end of this.
[56:52.440 --> 56:56.440]  But our governor, I think, should have had an investigation launched against him
[56:56.440 --> 57:00.440]  like was against Blagojevic and out there in the Chicago area.
[57:00.440 --> 57:06.440]  I mean, the governor of Pennsylvania is known for his shady politics coming out of the city of Philadelphia,
[57:06.440 --> 57:08.440]  and this is just another extension of it.
[57:08.440 --> 57:10.440]  So where do you go from here?
[57:10.440 --> 57:13.440]  How do we, listeners all over the country and in Pennsylvania,
[57:13.440 --> 57:19.440]  put pressure on the state government or even the federal government to crack open this can of worms?
[57:19.440 --> 57:25.440]  Well, we're going to be continuing to file the right to no request that we've been working on over the last week
[57:25.440 --> 57:29.440]  with our legal staff, but we're going to be sending another letter over to the head of FEMA
[57:29.440 --> 57:35.440]  who gave testimony last Monday to ask some of the same questions that we asked of the director here
[57:35.440 --> 57:37.440]  in the Pennsylvania State Homeland Security.
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.440]  We're going to press whoever his replacement is to give us the information that we're looking for.
[57:42.440 --> 57:45.440]  There's still questions about the bulletins that were released.
[57:45.440 --> 57:49.440]  Have they, you know, where are they publicly still noticed right now?
[57:49.440 --> 57:55.440]  Where are they posted to try and have that information redacted
[57:55.440 --> 58:00.440]  to ensure that anybody who has been put on those that shouldn't have been has taken off of those
[58:00.440 --> 58:04.440]  so that they're not hanging out there in Cyberland without a correction?
[58:04.440 --> 58:08.440]  So there's a lot of work to be done, and we're going to continue to do that here.
[58:08.440 --> 58:12.440]  I encourage all of your listeners in Pennsylvania to contact their state legislators,
[58:12.440 --> 58:14.440]  both state senators and state representatives,
[58:14.440 --> 58:19.440]  and demand full accounting of what has happened here and demand action be taken
[58:19.440 --> 58:23.440]  against those who have violated the rights of the Pennsylvanians
[58:23.440 --> 58:26.440]  and other American citizens that may have been here in Pennsylvania
[58:26.440 --> 58:28.440]  and subject to this type of surveillance.
[58:28.440 --> 58:30.440]  All right, I've got two final key questions for you.
[58:30.440 --> 58:32.440]  We're going to be back in 70 seconds.
[58:32.440 --> 58:35.440]  Repmetcalf.com is the website.
[58:35.440 --> 58:45.440]  We'll be right back with a second hour in 70 seconds.

[59:07.440 --> 59:11.440]  and you will get an instant free estimate of your home's value online.
[59:11.440 --> 59:14.440]  This is a great way to be able to monitor the value of your home,
[59:14.440 --> 59:16.440]  and again, it's absolutely free.
[59:16.440 --> 59:18.440]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[59:18.440 --> 59:22.440]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to homegain.com.
[59:22.440 --> 59:26.440]  Use their home sale maximizer to help you determine which home improvements
[59:26.440 --> 59:29.440]  can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.

[1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:21.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:24.440]  All right, for some stations that just joined us,
[1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:27.440]  Representative Darrell Metcalf of Pennsylvania joins us.
[1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:30.440]  He was put on a potential terrorist list along with mainline
[1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:33.440]  Second Amendment groups that he works with and one that he heads up.
[1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:36.440]  Groups that are just, you know, mildly, you know,
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:41.440]  want to cut taxes, just mainline groups listed by this Israeli
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:46.440]  Mossad IDF-connected group, the head of Homeland Security
[1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:49.440]  has had to resign in the state.
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:51.440]  And, you know, here's the big issue.
[1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.440]  Regardless of where this investigation goes,
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:57.440]  state police, feds, local police,
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:00.440]  listening to us all over the country in Chicago and LA
[1:01:00.440 --> 1:01:06.440]  and San Francisco and Orlando, all over the place, Austin,
[1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:09.440]  they need to know that if you've got
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:13.440]  foreign private intelligence groups demonizing
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:16.440]  mainline conservatives and libertarians or liberals
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:19.440]  for that matter, and those groups have no history
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:22.440]  of anything illegal, this is treason that you're seeing.
[1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:24.440]  And I talked to the Representative during the one-minute break
[1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:27.440]  and I said, have you had any law enforcement contacts
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:28.440]  with more data?
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:30.440]  Because he's trying to get the full reports,
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:33.440]  but the Homeland Security's trying to block that
[1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:34.440]  at the state level.
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:37.440]  So he said he is happy to have law enforcement
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:40.440]  in the state of Pennsylvania or other law enforcement
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:41.440]  around the country.
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:44.440]  We've been sent the MIAC report and others last year
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:47.440]  to break this wide open because it's a lot worse
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:48.440]  than even what we know.
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:53.440]  Repmetcalf.com, Representative Metcalf, Repmetcalf.com,
[1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:56.440]  you can get him there, or Darrellmetcalf.com.
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:58.440]  But we've got a few minutes left before we have to go
[1:01:58.440 --> 1:02:01.440]  to your votes in open session there in Pennsylvania.
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:04.440]  But, I mean, can you comment on this demonization?
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:08.440]  I mean, this is defamation and we need to let police
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:10.440]  and others know when this is going on, you know,
[1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:11.440]  this is illegal.
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:12.440]  Go ahead.
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:13.440]  Well, we do.
[1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:16.440]  So when I was a soldier, it was very clear and made clear
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:20.440]  to us from our senior officers that there were such things
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:21.440]  as unlawful orders.
[1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:24.440]  And if an officer or an NCO gave you an unlawful order,
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:26.440]  then you did not have to follow it.
[1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:28.440]  And I think that's what our law enforcement officers have
[1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:31.440]  to remember across the country, is that their higher-ups
[1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:34.440]  are not always operating within the confines of the law
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:35.440]  or the Constitution.
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:38.440]  And when they go out of bounds, that they need to be aware,
[1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:40.440]  they need to be courageous enough to step forward
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.440]  to ensure that this isn't going to happen.
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:45.440]  I mean, these types of activities where you see law enforcement,
[1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:48.440]  rogue leadership and law enforcement or administrations
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:51.440]  around the country, they're happening in sanctuary cities
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:53.440]  where they're giving sanctuary status to illegal aliens.
[1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:56.440]  They're happening in cities where they're putting forth
[1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:59.440]  gun control measures that aren't legal underneath the law
[1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:01.440]  of those individual states that's happening here
[1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:04.440]  in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and New York
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:07.440]  and other areas where you see these rogue administrations
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:09.440]  trying to move their law enforcement in the direction
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:11.440]  of cracking down on law-abiding citizens when it's either
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:13.440]  against the law or unconstitutional.
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:16.440]  So we need our law enforcement officers to stand strong
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:18.440]  and we know the majority of them do and will.
[1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:21.440]  And we need them to be courageous in the face of this type
[1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:23.440]  of rogue activity that sometimes occurs
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:25.440]  by some of these higher-up individuals.
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:28.440]  And to be clear, state homeland security
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:30.440]  and the governor caught with their pants down
[1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:32.440]  are trying to keep this from coming out in the legislature.
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:34.440]  You are the government.
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:36.440]  You were elected by the people.
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:38.440]  The legislature is legitimate.
[1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:42.440]  Foreign Israeli spies working with the government,
[1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:44.440]  with the governor, that's illegitimate.
[1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:48.440]  And so you're asking law enforcement in Pennsylvania
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:51.440]  to send you whatever bulletins and stuff they've got
[1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:54.440]  on the patriot groups so that you can bring
[1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:56.440]  that to the full legislature, correct?
[1:03:56.440 --> 1:03:58.440]  That would be a great help if there's law enforcement
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:00.440]  officers out there that have information
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:02.440]  about what's taking place here with this
[1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:04.440]  Institute of Terrorism Research and Response
[1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:06.440]  and their connections to the homeland security
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:09.440]  or the FEMA or the state police,
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:11.440]  that any information that they could forward
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:13.440]  on to my office would be a great help as we continue
[1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.440]  the investigation.
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:16.440]  All right, that's Representative Darrell Metcalf
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:18.440]  with the 12th District in Pennsylvania,
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:22.440]  repmetcalf.com, our site's infowars.com.
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:24.440]  As this unfolds, sir, we'll check back in with you.
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:26.440]  God bless you for your patriotism and courage.
[1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.440]  Thank you, Alex. Thanks. Have a great day.
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:30.440]  You too. Okay, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:34.440]  Make no mistake, they've got 14 nations according to FEMA
[1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.440]  inside the U.S. spying on citizens.
[1:04:36.440 --> 1:04:38.440]  Israel's one of them.
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:41.440]  And this is all treason. It's all illegal.
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:44.440]  And if we get up on our hind legs and get angry about this
[1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:48.440]  and expose all this and open up this pustule,
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:51.440]  people can really see what's happening beneath the surface.
[1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:54.440]  So we know we have police listening in Pennsylvania.
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:57.440]  Get this stuff to the representative, okay?
[1:04:57.440 --> 1:05:00.440]  It's treason. You have a responsibility to get it to him.
[1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:03.440]  Listen up, friends. This is Alex Jones with key information.
[1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:05.440]  The mainstream media is now admitting
[1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:07.440]  that we're going into a depression.
[1:05:07.440 --> 1:05:10.440]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[1:05:10.440 --> 1:05:12.440]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality,
[1:05:12.440 --> 1:05:15.440]  storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:17.440]  They're the best company out there,
[1:05:17.440 --> 1:05:19.440]  the longest continually operating,
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:21.440]  and a ton of great food to choose from.
[1:05:21.440 --> 1:05:23.440]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis.
[1:05:23.440 --> 1:05:25.440]  Not some old, credit-y food they're selling you
[1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:27.440]  like some of the other guys.
[1:05:27.440 --> 1:05:29.440]  Try their new evacuation pack,
[1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:31.440]  a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:33.440]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it,
[1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:36.440]  with open talk of a strike on Iran the next three months,
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:39.440]  the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:42.440]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:44.440]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:46.440]  Go to their website online right now,
[1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:52.440]  eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:56.440]  Again on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex,
[1:05:56.440 --> 1:06:00.440]  or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[1:06:00.440 --> 1:06:02.440]  When you're out on the road,
[1:06:02.440 --> 1:06:07.440]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:09.440]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[1:06:09.440 --> 1:06:12.440]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:16.440]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:21.440]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:25.440]  They so pride in every stitch,
[1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:29.440]  guarantee you love the way they fit.
[1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:32.440]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:34.440]  where you need it most.
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:39.440]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.440]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans.
[1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:46.440]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:48.440]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine
[1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:50.440]  gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:52.440]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:55.440]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[1:06:55.440 --> 1:07:20.440]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:25.440]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:28.440]  New social legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:31.440]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:33.440]  Thousands of families lose their power
[1:07:33.440 --> 1:07:36.440]  from weather-related onages.
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:38.440]  A solar power generator provides
[1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:40.440]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:42.440]  I believe in the solar power generators
[1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:44.440]  offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:46.440]  one of my old sponsors.
[1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:50.440]  For more information at www.mysolarbackup.com,
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:52.440]  that's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:54.440]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,
[1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:56.440]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:07:56.440 --> 1:08:01.440]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:04.440]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:10.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:13.440]  Okay, we've got James Dilling bull joining us
[1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:16.440]  for about 26 minutes from now
[1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:19.440]  to talk about how the youth of the world
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:22.440]  are being brainwashed that killing themselves is good.
[1:08:22.440 --> 1:08:25.440]  This really shows you the anti-human eugenics agenda
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:26.440]  being pushed.
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:27.440]  It is now out.
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:29.440]  Paul Watson working on this report
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:31.440]  all throughout the weekend,
[1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:35.440]  and today just went up on prisonplanet.com
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:37.440]  just minutes ago.
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.440]  October surprise terror hysteria
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:44.440]  sprinkled in election ploy.
[1:08:44.440 --> 1:08:46.440]  And he's got all the admissions
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:49.440]  of government-sponsored terror where it's declassified.
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:51.440]  He's got Governor Ridge admitting
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.440]  that they issued fake terror alerts
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:55.440]  before the 2004 election.
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:58.440]  He's got the quotes by the Obama people,
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:08:59.440]  saying,
[1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:03.440]  G-Weed terror attacks so people learn to love Barry Sataro.
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:08.440]  It is all in this detailed report right now
[1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:12.440]  up at prisonplanet.com,
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:14.440]  also going up at infowars.com
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:16.440]  as we speak via Kurt Nemo.
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.440]  But just during the break, Aaron Dykes walked in here
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:21.440]  and said he was listening to news radio 590 KLBJ
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:23.440]  at about 10 a.m. in their morning host.
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:24.440]  We're going,
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:27.440]  yeah, Alex Jones talked about how a CIA operative
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:29.440]  was the head of the Mumbai attacks,
[1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:31.440]  and then it came out on mainstream news.
[1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:33.440]  And now Alex was just saying a few weeks ago
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:35.440]  that you watch, they'll claim that airports
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:37.440]  are going to be attacked and shoot them up
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:39.440]  because I could see them pre-positioning that.
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.440]  They always kind of market test things.
[1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:43.440]  And the hosts were going,
[1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:46.440]  wow, he really knows what he's talking about.
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:48.440]  Again, that's just a local show that's actually,
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:50.440]  it's a good show,
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:51.440]  but sometimes they've teased me a bit.
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:55.440]  The point is people are really starting to come around
[1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:58.440]  because they can see that we lay out exactly what's going on.
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:00.440]  We read you White House quotes
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:03.440]  under Bush and now Obama,
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:05.440]  and their strategist saying,
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:07.440]  we sure need another terror attack.
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:08.440]  It sure helped us.
[1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:10.440]  I mean, come on, come on.
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:12.440]  People say, why would the government do something like that,
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:14.440]  or why would they let people attack us?
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:15.440]  There's different types of attacks.
[1:10:15.440 --> 1:10:16.440]  They let people attack,
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:18.440]  or they finance through terror groups,
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:20.440]  where the ground level terrorists don't even know
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:21.440]  who they're working for,
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:23.440]  or sometimes they completely stage events,
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:25.440]  or in other cases, nothing happens,
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:27.440]  and they just make up an event.
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:31.440]  Oh my gosh, our aircraft carriers were attacked.
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:32.440]  Well, actually they weren't.
[1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:34.440]  Somebody said on the radio they were.
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:35.440]  Or oh my gosh,
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:37.440]  the North Vietnamese have attacked our destroyers,
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:39.440]  Gulf of Tonkin, 1964.
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:40.440]  We've got to go to war.
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:42.440]  They attacked.
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.440]  40 years later, they released the LBJ audio tapes
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:45.440]  with McNamara.
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:48.440]  LBJ is out at his Johnson City Ranch.
[1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:49.440]  You know, talking to McNamara,
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:50.440]  McNamara is bossing him around.
[1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:52.440]  This is how we're going to do it.
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:53.440]  There's going to be an event tomorrow,
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:54.440]  and they're in the Gulf,
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:56.440]  and Vietnam, right?
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:57.440]  That's right.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:10:58.440]  And then you're going to do a press conference.
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:00.440]  We've got to get tough on this.
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:01.440]  All right.
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:03.440]  And then the day of the event,
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:05.440]  he goes, okay, you know what to do tomorrow.
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:06.440]  Yeah, I know what to do.
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:07.440]  It's told me yesterday.
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:09.440]  We've played those tapes here before.
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:13.440]  And, you know, talk about how we're not clear exactly,
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:15.440]  but we were attacked.
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:18.440]  You know, that way if stuff comes out, it won't be clear.
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:19.440]  I mean, they're even, I mean,
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:21.440]  I ought to dig those up again and play them.
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:27.440]  I found them back in 2004 when it was declassified,
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:29.440]  played them.
[1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:31.440]  Then it got news the next year.
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:34.440]  And then the last time I saw those clips excised out,
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:36.440]  was it changed the channel on YouTube,
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:38.440]  the guy that posted a lot of our full-length videos,
[1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:39.440]  because he has a director's channel,
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:43.440]  and he did one on false flags and actually got the clips
[1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:46.440]  and put them together over the three-day period.
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:48.440]  In fact, I excised that out a few months ago
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:49.440]  and meant to play it again.
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:53.440]  But side issue, the point is that you can see this stuff
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:54.440]  coming from 100 miles away.
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:57.440]  And now here's the election coming up,
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:11:58.440]  and they are specific.
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:00.440]  They are going to attack airports.
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.440]  And they may have some nutty, you know,
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:06.440]  religious fruitcakes who they've got ready,
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:08.440]  who really think they're fighting for Allah,
[1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:10.440]  but it'll always come out, in every case,
[1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:14.440]  their commander is CIA, MI6 or Mossad,
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:17.440]  and they're funding the lunatics to do it.
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:20.440]  Or they'll have commandos go in and shoot some people.
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:22.440]  They'll have one Patsy with them.
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:24.440]  They'll shoot the Patsy in the back of the head.
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:27.440]  The commandos will change clothes, go out the back door,
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:29.440]  and then we have the one dead Patsy.
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:32.440]  Or like the Mumbai attack led by the CIA.
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:33.440]  We got that at the time.
[1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:35.440]  The head of Indian intelligence even came out
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:37.440]  and said that, and he wasn't a Muslim.
[1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:39.440]  Of course, he died in that attack that day,
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:40.440]  but he said the day before,
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:44.440]  the government's going to launch a false flag.
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:47.440]  In fact, there's a Paul Joseph Watson article,
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:49.440]  terrorist fear mongering about Mumbai's
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:51.440]  dollar tax as an election ploy.
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:55.440]  And that's September 29th.
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:58.440]  So that was actually last week.
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:01.440]  We were already on to the specifics of what they were doing.
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:04.440]  And now here we are five days later, October 4th,
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:06.440]  with the latest Paul Joseph Watson report,
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:13.440]  October surprise terror hysteria recycled an election ploy.
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:16.440]  Now we did search terms twice last week,
[1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:17.440]  and the time is short.
[1:13:17.440 --> 1:13:19.440]  Who knows how long we'll be on air.
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:21.440]  Hopefully for 20 more years,
[1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:23.440]  and hopefully we beat this thing,
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:24.440]  but you never know what's going to happen.
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:26.440]  They could launch World War III, Total Depression.
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:28.440]  I could die in a car wreck, God forbid.
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:29.440]  Anything could happen.
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:33.440]  So we've been using this search term while it's still effective.
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:36.440]  And to give you an example, last week,
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:40.440]  we had a search term, Feds Radiate Americans.
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:46.440]  And it made it in Yahoo News, AOL News, Christian Science Monitor.
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:49.440]  And over, first it was 20 plus reports.
[1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:51.440]  Now it's over 100 reports.
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:52.440]  I can't even count them all up.
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:57.440]  It'll say, you know, under this headline, 27 others, 42 others, 10 others.
[1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:00.440]  I mean, I can go to Google News and count them up.
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:02.440]  It's over 100 reports.
[1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:06.440]  And then the Drudge Report, two days later, linked to our article.
[1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:10.440]  But above it, linked to Yahoo, who literally took our headline,
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:14.440]  pulled our paragraphs, changed them just a little bit,
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:15.440]  but gave us no credit.
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:16.440]  I don't care.
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:21.440]  It caused and is causing a national debate about Feds Radiating Americans.
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:24.440]  Like, what are you doing driving around with 500 trucks,
[1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:28.440]  blasting high-powered radiation into our homes that looks right through walls?
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:30.440]  What are you doing with naked body scanners on the streets?
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:32.440]  What are you doing with all of this?
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:36.440]  Then we had another search term that caused a huge debate.
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:39.440]  So I'm going to do this at least one more time this week.
[1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:40.440]  But it's such a powerful tool.
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:43.440]  I don't want to overuse it, but listeners keep telling me,
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:46.440]  no, no, use it, use it, use it.
[1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:49.440]  So we're going to do it today.
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:51.440]  And I'm here looking at the headline.
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:53.440]  It's got to be something from the headline,
[1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:57.440]  so that then this will be the top story when everybody links to it.
[1:14:57.440 --> 1:15:01.440]  But the search term, we need to get Nemo to get this up right now,
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:05.440]  because sometimes Google blocks our headlines from Prison Planet when we do this.
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:08.440]  They're watching us in real time, so it won't show up.
[1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:11.440]  So it becomes the number one search term,
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:14.440]  but then they let mainstream media jump on it
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:16.440]  and write disinformation connected to it.
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:20.440]  So we're in a little info war with these people.
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:27.440]  But let's make the search term terror hysteria, terror hysteria.
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:36.440]  Two words, terror hysteria, T-E-R-R-O-R, hysteria, H-Y-S-T-E-R-I-A.
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:41.440]  Terror hysteria, terror hysteria.
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:43.440]  That'll be search term number one.
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:48.440]  Let's have a double combo today.
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:54.440]  And let's go with a triple word combo for number two.
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:59.440]  Let's go with October surprise terror.
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.440]  So one search term is terror hysteria.
[1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:03.440]  We want that to be number one.
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:05.440]  It's entering into Google over and over again into the search box.
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:08.440]  Terror hysteria.
[1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:11.440]  And then the other search term is a three word combo.
[1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:14.440]  October surprise terror.
[1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:17.440]  October surprise terror.
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:19.440]  And then this can cause, if you do it,
[1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:21.440]  in which I'm sure you will and I love you to death,
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:23.440]  we're all in this together, it's beautiful what you're doing,
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:26.440]  then this will cause media to go read our article
[1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:29.440]  and all these newspaper reporters who aren't really operatives,
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:31.440]  they're just compartmentalized, they'll go,
[1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:35.440]  yeah, this is kind of an obvious October surprise.
[1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:37.440]  And then they'll read Watson's article
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:39.440]  that goes through the whole history of this
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:42.440]  and resistance is victory.
[1:16:42.440 --> 1:16:44.440]  Will this one search term beat the new order?
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:49.440]  No, but the act of always moving forward,
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:52.440]  it will have that effect.
[1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:53.440]  Resistance is victory.
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:55.440]  So terror hysteria is search number one,
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:57.440]  search number two, October surprise terror,
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:00.440]  a three word combo.
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:02.440]  Let me read this article now here in this segment,
[1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:04.440]  the next, then James Dilling-Pulse joining us.
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:06.440]  October surprise terror hysteria,
[1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:08.440]  recycled in election ploy.
[1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:10.440]  Cynical stunt to frighten angry Americans
[1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:14.440]  into placing their trust back in government.
[1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:17.440]  The establishment media is giving full court press
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:19.440]  to announcements from the US and European authorities
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:22.440]  that airport lobbies are being targeted for terror attacks
[1:17:22.440 --> 1:17:26.440]  in a recycled version of the laughable 2007 incident
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  in which two retards, that's the word Watson uses,
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:31.440]  mentally retarded men, that was admitted,
[1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:34.440]  set fire to a Jeep outside Glasgow airport,
[1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:38.440]  a non-event that authorities hype beyond all recognition
[1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:43.440]  amidst a similar wave of hysteria,
[1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:46.440]  which we are now witnessing.
[1:17:46.440 --> 1:17:49.440]  And it continues, the October surprise has arrived
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:52.440]  and it's a contrived and cynical ploy
[1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:55.440]  to frighten Americans into putting their trust back in government
[1:17:55.440 --> 1:17:59.440]  by waving their familiar boogeyman of the outside threat.
[1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:03.440]  Among the possible targets in the suspected European terror plot
[1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:06.440]  are pre-security areas at the last,
[1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:09.440]  at least five major European airports,
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:11.440]  a law enforcement official, ABC News.
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:14.440]  Authorities believe terror teams are preparing to mount
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:18.440]  a commando-like attack featuring small units
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:22.440]  and small firearms model after the Mumbai attack
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:23.440]  of two years ago.
[1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:26.440]  Consistent references to the Mumbai attack,
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:30.440]  transit hubs, airport lobbies and other soft targets
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:35.440]  chatter provide a reasonably clear indication
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:40.440]  as to who is really behind the ceaseless pushing
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:43.440]  of terror fear-mongering we've been subject to
[1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:47.440]  over the last week.
[1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.440]  Since it ultimately emerged that the mastermind behind
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:53.440]  the Mumbai massacre was a CIA agent, David Hadley,
[1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:55.440]  warnings from the same intelligence agencies
[1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:57.440]  about similar attacks being planned
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:18:59.440]  should be treated as a direct threat.
[1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:02.440]  Throughout the 60s, 70s, 80s, the Central Intelligence Agency
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:04.440]  played a key role in Operation Gladio,
[1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:08.440]  a program of false flag terror attacks on soft targets
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:10.440]  in Europe, I would add, that were designed to demonize
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:13.440]  political opposition and force the public to turn
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.440]  to the state to ask for greater security
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:19.440]  according to testimony of Gladio agent.
[1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:21.440]  And also the former Italian president went public
[1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:23.440]  and said that he knew about all this.
[1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:25.440]  In 2000, the Italian Senate investigated and found
[1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:27.440]  that the 1980 Bologna train bombing,
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:29.440]  which killed 85 people, was carried out by men
[1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:31.440]  inside Italian state institutions,
[1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:35.440]  and men linked to structures of the United States intelligence.
[1:19:35.440 --> 1:19:38.440]  We'll continue with this on the other side.
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:41.440]  We won't have time to read it all before our guest joins us.
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:43.440]  It's a key breakdown.
[1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:45.440]  We need to get this article, October surprise,
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:48.440]  terror hysteria recycled in election ploy.
[1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:50.440]  We need to get this out to everyone.
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.440]  Get the article at prisonplanet.com, please.
[1:19:52.440 --> 1:19:54.440]  Send it to everyone you know,
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:56.440]  because the globalists may be getting ready
[1:19:56.440 --> 1:20:00.440]  to actually stage terror, not just hype terror for fear.
[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:02.440]  This may surprise you.
[1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:04.440]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:06.440]  among both adults and children.
[1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:08.440]  You or someone you know may have it.
[1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:10.440]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:12.440]  is a never-ending task.
[1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:14.440]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:17.440]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes
[1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:20.440]  can be reversed in only 21 days.
[1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:22.440]  Purium Health Products recently developed a product
[1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:25.440]  that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study
[1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:28.440]  called Scoop of Greens, an easy, great tasting, affordable way

[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:02.440]  Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors.
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:04.440]  Are we going to see economic growth?
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:06.440]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:08.440]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:10.440]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly,
[1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:13.440]  divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:15.440]  When the market becomes volatile,
[1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:17.440]  U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:20.440]  What do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself
[1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:22.440]  and spends beyond its means?
[1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:25.440]  Many investors are turning toward gold as a common-sense alternative
[1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:27.440]  to traditional paper investments.
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:30.440]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book titled
[1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:33.440]  10 Reasons to Own Gold, discussing costs, benefits, risks,
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:36.440]  featuring full-color illustrations, weights, and measures.

[1:22:58.440 --> 1:23:02.440]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work
[1:23:02.440 --> 1:23:04.440]  to improve blood circulation? Listen.
[1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:07.440]  My name is Ellis and I am 66 years old
[1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:09.440]  and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:12.440]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:15.440]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:19.440]  They wanted me to go on plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:22.440]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy,
[1:23:22.440 --> 1:23:24.440]  and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe
[1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:27.440]  at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[1:23:27.440 --> 1:23:30.440]  Within the first month, I felt a dramatic difference.
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:32.440]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:34.440]  and within two months, I felt completely normal.
[1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:37.440]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health

[1:23:49.440 --> 1:24:10.440]  Call 866-295-5305 for heart and body extract.
[1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:14.440]  Under the Future Attribute Screening Technologies or FAST program,
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:16.440]  the Department of Homeland Security
[1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:21.440]  is developing innovative physiological and behavioral screening technologies
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:25.440]  to streamline the screening process at security checkpoints.
[1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:27.440]  In support of this program,
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.440]  Battelle has partnered with industry leaders,
[1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:31.440]  Farber Specialty Vehicles,
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:34.440]  and Draper Laboratory to design and develop
[1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:36.440]  a portable research facility
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.440]  for the development and demonstration
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:41.440]  of innovative security screening technologies,
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:44.440]  the FAST demonstration laboratory.
[1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:47.440]  The mobility of the FAST demonstration laboratory
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:50.440]  allows security officials to quickly and efficiently
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:53.440]  establish security boundaries at any location,
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:57.440]  making it useful for everything from large sporting events,
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:24:59.440]  border crossings, or airports.
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:03.440]  Okay, so they're giant 18-wheeler trailers
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:05.440]  that have three ramps leading into them
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:08.440]  with naked body scanners, face scanners.
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:12.440]  They ask you questions that then brain scan you.
[1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:14.440]  Total Orwell.
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:16.440]  And Jaren pointed out,
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:18.440]  well, I had said this earlier in the hour,
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:20.440]  but he pointed out specifically to me there in the break
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:22.440]  and made me think of this.
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:25.440]  They've already rolled all this out, as I said earlier.
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:27.440]  They've said they want Israeli companies
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:29.440]  to advise airports worldwide
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:31.440]  on a first line of screening
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:33.440]  before you even get into the airport.
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.440]  Then you go through the next checkpoints that they already have,
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:39.440]  then they have checkpoints at the gate.
[1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:41.440]  So two more layers.
[1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:44.440]  First layer, they want to put one in front of it and behind it.
[1:25:44.440 --> 1:25:46.440]  And I talked about, you watch,
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:48.440]  they're going to set up checkpoints.
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:51.440]  I said this last hour, out front.
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:55.440]  And you watch, just like with the naked body scanners
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:59.440]  being rolled out, they already ordered them
[1:25:59.440 --> 1:26:03.440]  in the days after the underwear bomber on Christmas.
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:06.440]  Now you watch, they have the specific airports
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:09.440]  and specifically that it's going to be in the area
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:11.440]  where you walk in to get your tickets.
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:14.440]  So now they can have the mobile trucks out front the airport
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:16.440]  and herd you through it and watch.
[1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:18.440]  In the next few weeks, or even sooner,
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:20.440]  if they go ahead and stage something,
[1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:23.440]  they're going to say, oh my gosh, we need the mobile trucks.
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:24.440]  We need them out there.
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:26.440]  Jeremy pointed that out and he's absolutely right.
[1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:28.440]  Airport lobbies, possible terror targets,
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.440]  and European plot officials say ABC News,
[1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:35.440]  among the possible targets in the suspected European terror plot
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:37.440]  are pre-security areas.
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:39.440]  Five major European airports,
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:41.440]  a law enforcement official told ABC News.
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:43.440]  I mean, how do they know that?
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:46.440]  Authorities believe terror teams are preparing to mount
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:48.440]  a commando-like attack featuring small units
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:51.440]  and small firearms modeled after the Mumbai attack two years ago,
[1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:53.440]  which was in shopping malls.
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:58.440]  And you can pull up FBI wants checkpoints at shopping malls.
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:00.440]  In fact, search that, you'll find it.
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:02.440]  And they're going to have these big mobile trucks
[1:27:02.440 --> 1:27:05.440]  and you're herded through it to go to sporting events, malls.
[1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:08.440]  It said they look for, they ask you questions about bombs
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:09.440]  and recording devices.
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:11.440]  Oh, are you bringing a recording device?
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:13.440]  Well, yeah, my iPhone records.
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:15.440]  Oh, you're bringing that into the classical symphony
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:20.440]  or into the megadeth symphony or into the George Strait concert?
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:23.440]  Training everyone that life in the airport
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:25.440]  is life outside the airport.
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:28.440]  So this is clearly another big rollout
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:30.440]  for the systems they've already been ordering.
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:32.440]  So very interesting point on that front.
[1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:35.440]  And again, the article by Paul Joseph Watson goes through
[1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:38.440]  the whole history of admitted government-sponsored terror.
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:40.440]  You realize how important this is.
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:43.440]  So the search terms are terror hysteria.
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:44.440]  That's one search term.
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:47.440]  Those two words you enter into Google over and over again.
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:50.440]  And October surprise terror.
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:53.440]  Three words is the second search.
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:55.440]  And it continues.
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:58.440]  These are quotes from the Italian Parliamentary hearing
[1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:00.440]  with the former head of Italian intelligence
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:03.440]  and the president saying,
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:08.440]  forcing the public to turn to the state
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:10.440]  to ask for greater security.
[1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:12.440]  What did Robert Shapiro say?
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:13.440]  To teach us to love Obama.
[1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:14.440]  We need terror.
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:15.440]  To love them.
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:16.440]  Oh, you keep me safe.
[1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:18.440]  Oh, the men in black uniforms.
[1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:19.440]  Oh, the checkpoints.
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:21.440]  Oh, the blood-taking checkpoints.
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:22.440]  Oh, the naked body scanners.
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:23.440]  Please radiate me.
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:24.440]  Keep me safe.
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:26.440]  Oh, please put carbon taxes on me.
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:28.440]  Or the water will rise and kill me.
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:30.440]  It's always the same thing.
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:33.440]  Oh, we'll have to be killed if we don't accept the carbon taxes.
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:34.440]  That's their new message.
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:38.440]  That's coming up.
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:40.440]  And it continues in an attempt to, quote,
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:42.440]  force the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security.
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:43.440]  That's a quote.
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:45.440]  The establishment hopes to derail the momentum
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:48.440]  of the Tea Party candidates like Rand Paul, Sharon Engel,
[1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:50.440]  whose entire campaigns are built on the premise
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:52.440]  of turning away from the state
[1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:54.440]  and giving power back to the individual,
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:56.440]  manipulating voters by threatening terror,
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:58.440]  for Republicans in 04.
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:00.440]  The Democrats might have to go a step further
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:04.440]  if they hope to use it as a deciding factor in 2010.
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:07.440]  And again, remember what Ridge admitted in MSNBC?
[1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:11.440]  He was told to issue fake terror alerts ahead of the election.
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:13.440]  This is admitted.
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:16.440]  The threat of airport lobbies being targeted is another giveaway.
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:19.440]  The last time this occurred was the summer of 07,
[1:29:19.440 --> 1:29:23.440]  when two amateur mental deficients described as
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:26.440]  crazy clown jihads by bomb experts
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:29.440]  set fire to some petrol outside Glasgow Airport
[1:29:29.440 --> 1:29:31.440]  in a pathetic attempt to stage a terror attack.
[1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:33.440]  And it goes through all the rest of it.
[1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:35.440]  We're going to shift gears into the other stage terror.
[1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:37.440]  The sky is falling, chicken little.
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:39.440]  Let Al Gore have all your money.
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:41.440]  Let federal people inspect your homes.
[1:29:41.440 --> 1:29:44.440]  Kids, tattle on your parents for carbon crimes.
[1:29:44.440 --> 1:29:46.440]  Or the ocean's going to rise.
[1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:47.440]  We're all going to die.
[1:29:47.440 --> 1:29:48.440]  It's global warming.
[1:29:48.440 --> 1:29:49.440]  I mean climate change.
[1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:50.440]  I mean global cooling.
[1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:51.440]  I mean...
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:54.440]  March, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.440 --> 1:30:23.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:05.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:08.440]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:13.440]  Is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home?
[1:31:13.440 --> 1:31:19.440]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:24.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:28.440]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:34.440]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:41.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[1:31:41.440 --> 1:31:48.440]  Today seems like nobody does care. Right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:06.440]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[1:32:06.440 --> 1:32:09.440]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:14.440]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:13.440]  Our Earth, healthy, strong and full of life. But wait, what's that you've got there? It looks like you've got a case of the humans.
[1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:20.440]  To be a healthy Earth, all of your elements must be in equilibrium.
[1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:31.440]  However, these parasites slaughter all other forms of life. Guzzle your natural resources.
[1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:38.440]  And poison your atmosphere.
[1:33:38.440 --> 1:33:49.440]  Once contracted, humans act quickly. They multiply over 300,000 a day, consuming anything that crosses their path.
[1:33:49.440 --> 1:34:04.440]  Earth is just the start. Who knows what's next?
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:14.440]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:29.440]  Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:39.440]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and James Dillingpole, best-selling author, writes for The Telegraph and many other global publications,
[1:34:39.440 --> 1:34:46.440]  is our guest. I just played for you the 2007 Berlin Film Festival winner of short films.
[1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:54.440]  It's called Humans by Three Legs, and it shows humans not just a scourge on the planet Earth, the people that brought you Beethoven,
[1:34:54.440 --> 1:35:00.440]  the folks that brought you mathematics, the mind of Max Planck envisioning atomic theory.
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:11.440]  I mean, that's humans. We are a scourge, and it shows us, unfortunately, spreading to space and destroying the universe at the end.
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:17.440]  I mean, this is incredible. And I was just thinking this morning about how many video clips.
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:22.440]  I mean, I have ABC News Australia, the headline, Teaching Kids When to Die, and it says,
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:30.440]  If you don't kill yourself by 11 or 14 in the calculations, even if you try to have a good carbon footprint, you must die at 14.
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:34.440]  Little animals die, and it shows little puppies having their heads chopped up.
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:41.440]  In fact, guys pull up the ABC story. ABC tells kids when to die, and then we have the Prison Planet article that actually has screenshots,
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:46.440]  because they pulled it, of the heads being cut off of small animals.
[1:35:46.440 --> 1:35:53.440]  So the message is, small animals are dying, and I talked to parents who still have their children in private school and government brainwashing camps.
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:36:01.440]  That's why I homeschool my children. And their young daughters and sons will start crying when they see a construction site or bulldozers,
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:07.440]  and they say, I need to die. I mean, I've had people at pool parties, you know, tell me this.
[1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:12.440]  Their children cry. It's seven-year-olds. It's time for me to die. I'm evil.
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:19.440]  And then we have, of course, this 10-10 project funded through the Climate Exchange in Al Gore, the Guardian, local governments in England funding it,
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:23.440]  saying it's your choice, and the kids say, I don't want to make carbon cuts.
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:28.440]  And so they murder them. They blow them up with guts and blood.
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:32.440]  And then those that submit to the tyranny, they have blood all over them and are horrified.
[1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:36.440]  Then they kill footballers and blow up coaches and blow up talk show hosting.
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:45.440]  And they have a corporate scene with a corporate boss standing above all his employees with an arrogant, effeminate, you know, behavior these people always have for some reason,
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:51.440]  and says, oh, lovely, you're not going to do it. Good. I get to kill you and kills them.
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:56.440]  So then I have this article on alternative to the new wave of eco-fascism.
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:02.440]  The Guardian says why these calls for total tyranny and Nazism are bad.
[1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:08.440]  We just need a soft, loving tyranny. So there's a total shift to them saying, look, you won't go along with this.
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:12.440]  We're going to kill you. James Dillingpole, an expert on this, joins us.
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:16.440]  And we're going to later play a short clip of Pechari saying, hey, we're going to scare the kids.
[1:37:16.440 --> 1:37:21.440]  And they've admitted we don't have the adults. Al Gore says this. We're going right for your children.
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:28.440]  So are you going to let them indoctrinate your children with an anti-human hate of themselves and how to commit suicide?
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:34.440]  These people are totally criminal. I mean, they're trying to arrest members of, you know, parliament in Europe
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:41.440]  who criticize Muslims mildly for hate crime. Is this not a hate crime teaching kids to commit suicide, James Dillingpole?
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:44.440]  Well, you know, Alex, I think this is a very significant story.
[1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:49.440]  I think it's as significant in its way as last year's Climate Gate.
[1:37:49.440 --> 1:37:53.440]  And this story they're calling Splattergate.
[1:37:53.440 --> 1:38:05.440]  What's interesting about Splattergate is that it gives us an insight into the eco-fascist mind caught out in an unguarded moment.
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:12.440]  What's interesting is before this video went out, you know, it was being promoted by the Guardian newspaper,
[1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:17.440]  which as you know is part of the Envirofascist conspiracy.
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:24.440]  And the filmmakers were discussing this film, you know, and the various greens involved that were talking about it.
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:31.440]  And they were all going, oh, isn't this funny? It's a bit naughty, but it'll get our message across all right.
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:41.440]  And what they had, they had no idea whatsoever that what they were doing was offensive, evil, wrong on so many levels.
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:48.440]  As far as they were concerned, it was perfectly reasonable to show people who don't believe in manmade, global warming children
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:54.440]  in a classroom who won't play the eco game being executed.
[1:38:54.440 --> 1:39:01.440]  Because this, unfortunately, is how the Envirofascists really see the world.
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:07.440]  You know, scratch the surface of what you find is a belief in pretty much the same things that the Nazis believed,
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:15.440]  you know, in population control, in nature being more important than the human species.
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:22.440]  You know, this attitude came originally from the Romantics, but it reached its high point in, you know,
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:28.440]  late German Romantics, and that was filtered through Nazi Germany, and then it went in.
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:34.440]  Well, in the French Revolution, as you're showing your historical knowledge, they wanted to depopulate by 80%
[1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:38.440]  and change the work week till nine days, one day off.
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:42.440]  They want to play God, and they have this Romantic idea of killing everybody.
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:49.440]  Really, it's just a psychopathic cult of mass murderers who have packaged an excuse to be control freak murderers.
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:56.440]  Oh yeah, absolutely. And I think it's really special for those of us who've been following this debate some time,
[1:39:56.440 --> 1:40:01.440]  who've been trying to say, look, these are not nice, cuddly, bunny-hugging people.
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:06.440]  They don't just care about nature. They also hate the human race.
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:13.440]  And you say this to people, and they go, but hold on a second, what's so wrong with trying to save the world from climate change?
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:16.440]  You know, what's so wrong about caring about the environment?
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:21.440]  And you say to them, look, there is nothing wrong with caring about the environment
[1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:25.440]  if you're talking about things like sensible conservation measures.
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:32.440]  But this is something entirely different. This is a concerted campaign to regulate human behavior.
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:37.440]  It is a concerted campaign to destroy the capitalist system.
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:41.440]  It is a concerted campaign to ration what they call scarce resources,
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:47.440]  all in the name of an ecological problem which they invented themselves.
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:54.440]  It doesn't exist. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that dangerous man-made climate change is happening.
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:40:58.440]  There is no evidence at all. So they have to have this.
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:01.440]  They haven't got the facts on this side. So what do they do?
[1:41:01.440 --> 1:41:05.440]  They conduct propaganda campaigns like this. Higgy is advert.
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:09.440]  And it's not the first. Do you remember the one earlier this year, or maybe at the end of last year,
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:15.440]  where they had all these polar bears falling out of the sky, you know, dying, you know, smashing into the streets?
[1:41:15.440 --> 1:41:18.440]  And it shows then humans being killed by the climate change.
[1:41:18.440 --> 1:41:22.440]  And they had that other one where the kid says, no more Mr. Nice Guy by Greenpeace.
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:25.440]  We're coming for you.
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:32.440]  Yeah, exactly. There was the one with that horrible kid in the hood saying, yes, you have not obeyed the ways of greenness.
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:36.440]  You have not cared for nature. Now we will come to destroy you.
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:40.440]  And there was another Greenpeace adder, again, a couple of years ago,
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:44.440]  which shows a guy coming to the office and everyone is kind of making sort of, you know,
[1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:47.440]  you're a prick. I'm really being horrible to him.
[1:41:47.440 --> 1:41:50.440]  And guess what the terrible crime this guy is committed in?
[1:41:50.440 --> 1:41:56.440]  He's come to work in a four by four. These people hate any form of consumption.
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:41:59.440]  They hate any form of personal freedom.
[1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:00.440]  They all they want to pay.
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:02.440]  They hate any form they don't control.
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:05.440]  Yeah, exactly. And that's what it's all about. It is about.
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:11.440]  I mean, when they're flying around in their jets and living in, you know, 20,000 square foot houses
[1:42:11.440 --> 1:42:15.440]  and owning their private trains like Prince Charles, that's okay.
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:20.440]  But they're telling old lady pensioners, as you know, in England, we're going to cut your gas off
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:25.440]  and you can't have a hot bath. Okay. But we're going to use welfare money to pay for the Queen.
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:29.440]  Well, you read that story. That was quite funny, wasn't it?
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:33.440]  That Prince Charles, the Queen's son, is going around saying to everybody,
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:39.440]  going around in his biofuel powered Royal train saying everyone must cut their carbon emissions.
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:43.440]  You know, we must impose more green taxes on fossil fuels.
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:51.440]  And that is dear old mother, the Queen, applying to the government for emergency old folks desperation aid
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:56.440]  because her electricity and gas bills have increased by 50%.
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:03.440]  Why? Because of the green taxes imposed because of people like Prince Charles demanding that, you know,
[1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:06.440]  we, we rein in on our use of fossil fuels.
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:11.440]  Now, James, let's go back briefly here with you today to just a few months ago
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:17.440]  where they had a major university study in Canada and found they were six times more likely to steal,
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:20.440]  to be criminal, to hate their fellow man.
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:25.440]  This, this environmentalist guild, and I've met a lot of them, they really just hate everybody.
[1:43:25.440 --> 1:43:31.440]  And, and, and they see this as a vehicle to boss everybody around and nanny and nanny over everyone.
[1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:36.440]  And then you read all these top professors in the US, England, Europe, this new one out in the news
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:41.440]  being praised for saying exterminate people, I'm a Nazi.
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:43.440]  I mean, they're really a pack of lunatics.
[1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:46.440]  But I mean, that study showed this is a pack of criminals.
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:50.440]  Yes, but they mean well, Alex, they do it because they care.
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:52.440]  They want to kill us because they care too much.
[1:43:52.440 --> 1:43:57.440]  You know, the thing is, if you ask these people, if you met them at a party or whatever,
[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:02.440]  not that you would want to, but suppose you did, and you started talking to them,
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:06.440]  they would be, they would be perfectly gentle and pleasant people.
[1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:09.440]  They don't think of themselves as evil at all.
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:11.440]  And this is, of course, the problem.
[1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:15.440]  There was nothing more dangerous than somebody who was doing terrible things
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:17.440]  because it's for the good of the world.
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:21.440]  It's because, you know, they believe that they have rightness and justice.
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:22.440]  Well, that's what Hitler said.
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:25.440]  He was saving us, and he was a big environmentalist.
[1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:27.440]  Yeah, he was. He was absolutely, and so was them.
[1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:31.440]  Well, maybe you're bad, James, and maybe I'm bad because we don't think Hitler was good.
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:34.440]  We should have the red button pushed on us to show us.
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:39.440]  Oh, undoubtedly, well, I'm sure we already are on the first on their target list.
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:41.440]  I don't think you'd be worried about that.
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:49.440]  But yeah, I mean, it's, I think that's what's significant about this terrible video
[1:44:49.440 --> 1:44:53.440]  that, as I said, it shows them in an unguarded moment.
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:59.440]  It shows how they think underneath the mask of kindness and ecological righteousness.
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:01.440]  This is what they really believe.
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:06.440]  And you look at any of the key texts of the green movement, you know,
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:11.440]  Paul Ellick, Population Bomb, or...
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:12.440]  Holdren.
[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:14.440]  Silent, Silent Spring, yeah.
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:20.440]  Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau, Prince Philip, just get rid of 80% of us.
[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:21.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:26.440]  They all have this kind of fantasy that the world is overrun with these kind of, you know,
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:30.440]  this pollulating mask of hideous, maggot-like human beings,
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:34.440]  and that Mother Guy would be much better sloughing us all off.
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:39.440]  And, you know, if we don't kill ourselves through disease,
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:43.440]  then maybe a few red buttons here and there wouldn't go amiss.
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:46.440]  Ha-ha, we're really just joking, don't you worry.
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:49.440]  But James, it's funny you say that they think of us as worms.
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:53.440]  I played the Birdland Film Festival winning video where we're seen as parasite worms,
[1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:57.440]  and there's a new game kids are being taught called Super Megaworm.
[1:45:57.440 --> 1:45:58.440]  You're the worm.
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:01.440]  Mother Earth is on the brink of extinction because of humans.
[1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:05.440]  You are the great death worm, and you eat humans.
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:07.440]  Yeah, I mean, I've got kids.
[1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:13.440]  I've got kids that are one of the private school and one of the, you know, state school.
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:17.440]  And it doesn't matter what kind of school your kids are at,
[1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:19.440]  unless you do homeschooling, as you say,
[1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:23.440]  they are going to get exposed on a daily basis to this eco-propaganda.
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:27.440]  You know, I had a look at this expensive private school at the weekend
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:34.440]  where, you know, it costs something like $15,000, about $25,000 a year to send your child there.
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:39.440]  And, you know, I went into the science labs and there on the wall was this big poster
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:42.440]  provided by something called the Welcome Foundation, you know,
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:45.440]  sort of one of the British medical foundations.
[1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:51.440]  And it told them that man-made climate change was one of the greatest threats to the human species.
[1:46:51.440 --> 1:46:54.440]  And, you know, it was talking about decarbonization stuff.
[1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.440]  It presented all this science fiction, a science fact.
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:01.440]  Our children are being taught this every single day of their lives.
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:04.440]  James, while you've been speaking, they're coming in with new stuff.
[1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:06.440]  There's this super mega death worm.
[1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:11.440]  It goes around killing police, killing children, shooting fire out of its mouth,
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:13.440]  destroying buildings and cars.
[1:47:13.440 --> 1:47:17.440]  It goes into space and kills our astronauts.
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:19.440]  It attacks our military aircraft.
[1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:23.440]  I mean, these people, it's everything.
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:25.440]  I mean, it's incredible.
[1:47:25.440 --> 1:47:28.440]  Tell me about this death worm. What is it?
[1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:30.440]  Well, I mean, they just came in and showed it to me.
[1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:33.440]  My sister works up here. She was telling me about it earlier.
[1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:36.440]  But it's an iTunes, iPhone Touch.
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:38.440]  It's called Super Mega Worm.
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:40.440]  We'll get it up on infowars.com.
[1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:42.440]  We're playing their trailer.
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:45.440]  And interestingly enough, it only kills humans.
[1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:48.440]  They're space aliens in the game, but they're good, I guess, because they want us dead, too.
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:51.440]  Well, we just are. I mean, what we want to leave,
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:57.440]  the idea would be to leave this planet so that only the amoeba and other caring, nurturing creatures
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:47:59.440]  can live here in harmony and peace.
[1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:03.440]  You know, doing that amoeba thing, maybe with the polar bears talking to the Earth.
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:07.440]  Now, James, I know I'm jumping in here because there's so much going on.
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:13.440]  It seems now that they've been exposed with Climate Gate and then just a crescendo of other scandals
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:16.440]  that they're going crazy and coming out in the open.
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:21.440]  In fact, they're in the news, as I mentioned earlier, all over saying eco-fascism is good.
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:24.440]  We are tyrants, and we're coming for you.
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:27.440]  I mean, they're really letting us know who they are.
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:37.440]  Alex, we're in about 1944-1945 here. When the bad guys get close to defeat, they get much, much nastier.
[1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:39.440]  This is the time when they start bumping off the prisoners.
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:44.440]  It's when they start, you know, playing really, really dirty, as opposed to just quite dirty.
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:48.440]  All this is a sign of desperation. They failed at Copenhagen.
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  We've got the Cancun extravaganza coming up when precisely Zulch is going to happen,
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:59.440]  because if America won't play the cap and trade game, you know, if America isn't going to impose
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:06.440]  some kind of tax on carbon emissions, none of the rest of the world is going to do it either.
[1:49:06.440 --> 1:49:15.440]  So essentially, the car crash that is Obama's administration has helped bring about the end
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:19.440]  of the global warming craze.
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:24.440]  If you can't regulate carbon, you're not going to be able to tax carbon.
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:28.440]  If you're not going to be able to tax carbon, you're not going to be able to control business
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:32.440]  in the way that the greenies want, which is why what you see happening already is that
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:36.440]  they're starting to talk about new threats. They're talking about biodiversity.
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:42.440]  You're going to hear a lot of this. As the fire goes out of the manmade global warming craze,
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:47.440]  they're going to move on to other things, species loss. That's going to be the new thing.
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:52.440]  Now, James, we've only got the next segment with you. I know you're busy,
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:56.440]  but maybe we can hold you over because I want to talk about a host of issues with you
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:04.440]  and also play some of these clips. But when we come back, you posted on the telegraph of the newspaper
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:09.440]  a little boil down where somebody took the four-minute video of them murdering schoolchildren
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:14.440]  because they won't pay their carbon taxes, and they boiled it down to one minute
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:19.440]  where she actually kills all the children. And you pointed out that, hey, this is a lot better
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:21.440]  because they're being honest here.
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:25.440]  Yeah, well, exactly. I think I'm sure this was the version they'd have liked to put out,
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:29.440]  but with two tasteful and sensitive to do.
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:31.440]  Well, when we come back, we're going to get into that. And also in a rapid,
[1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:34.440]  you want you to get back into the schooling because this is the big issue.
[1:50:34.440 --> 1:50:42.440]  We pay for the schooling and we just turn our children over to literally be taught to hate themselves
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:46.440]  and that committing suicide is good. I mean, in Australia, they teach them to kill themselves.
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:51.440]  You cannot make this up. And it's ABC, the big Australian broadcasting system.
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:54.440]  I mean, this is not some backwater, you know, nutty group.
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:58.440]  This latest video is funded by Al Gore and The Guardian and everybody else.
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:23.440]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:31.440]  For you and your family. And here's the best part.

[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:30.440]  Specifically on this subject of all of this literature and the schools and everywhere that humans are parasites
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:39.440]  and have to be killed, the globalist, these new world order supporters are just coming out with their full religion to everybody now.

[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:49.440]  James, this is a short segment so I want to get these video clips out of the way and then get your take on them after the break.
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:55.440]  But first, here is Pichari, the disgraced head of the UN climate panel.
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:56:01.440]  Here he is on Al Jazeera admitting they want to go after our kids with their fearmongering. Here it is.
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:05.440]  It's interesting because you're using the media now obviously and then making the most media.
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:12.440]  What do you see as the tools, the next tools that you could utilize to try to create change?
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:21.440]  Children. I think we have to sensitize the young and tell them how their future is going to be affected if we don't take action today.
[1:56:21.440 --> 1:56:25.440]  And I think children are by and large very sensitive and they understand.
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:31.440]  They know what's at stake. And I think if we can get them to understand the seriousness of the problem,
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:35.440]  they would probably shame adults into taking the right steps.
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:37.440]  You feel like a drive change?
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:39.440]  I think they could drive change.
[1:56:39.440 --> 1:56:45.440]  All right. That's just like the youth brigades in China drove the change.
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:48.440]  And listen to him carefully. I want to get James' take on this.
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  He's saying they're very sensitive, i.e. we can scare the daylights out of these five, six, seven, eight-year-olds.
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:57:03.440]  And the UN affiliated groups funding videos of the simulated murder of what looked to be about 10-year-olds in this video if they don't submit.
[1:57:03.440 --> 1:57:08.440]  I mean, we're letting this Osama bin Laden lookalike sit there and menace and scare our children, James.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:14.440]  Well, you look at any totalitarian regime. What is the first thing it does?
[1:57:14.440 --> 1:57:21.440]  You had the communists setting up the young pioneers. You had Nazi Germany setting up the Hitler youth.
[1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:30.440]  One of the first things they do is try to take children away from the influence of their parents and school them in what they believe is the way of righteousness.
[1:57:30.440 --> 1:57:32.440]  They indoctrinate them.
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:43.440]  Of course, this is why people like Pichawari want to get the kids on board, because they want to get kids who are incapable of reasoning their way out of this situation.
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:52.440]  They want to brainwash them. While that famous Jesuit is saying, give me a child until he is seven and I will show you the man, this is brainwashing.
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:55.440]  Nothing else. And it is very sinister.
[1:57:55.440 --> 1:58:02.440]  But let's not forget that this has always been part of the grand plan. You know, it's what the club of Rome wanted.
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:11.440]  It is what the various United Nations documents have advocated, you know, that in order to win this war, we must first capture the minds of the young.
[1:58:11.440 --> 1:58:16.440]  We must take over the schools. We must take over the universities. And that way, eco-territy lies.
[1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:24.440]  And we can just hand them over to them. We're going to come back after this 72nd break and set a plan in the whole four-minute clip.
[1:58:24.440 --> 1:58:31.440]  James is linked to one on his London Telegraph page with what their real message is.
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:38.440]  Somebody is taking it and re-editing it where the teacher kills everyone, you know, not just the kids that don't submit to the tyranny.
[1:58:38.440 --> 1:58:54.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:14.440]  The film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[1:59:14.440 --> 1:59:20.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:24.440]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[1:59:24.440 --> 1:59:29.440]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[1:59:29.440 --> 1:59:35.440]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[1:59:35.440 --> 1:59:41.440]  Only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[2:00:06.440 --> 2:00:13.440]  Mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:23.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:37.440]  Go green or we will kill your kids.
[2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:44.440]  James, I noticed that they pulled this video very, very quickly, but since then it's been copied all over the internet.
[2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:52.440]  We have copies that we've been playing here. It seems this is backfired on them and they have a little apology up on their 1010 website.
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:58.440]  One of the more amusing explanations I've heard for this disaster was that, oh, it was all deliberate.
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:05.440]  It was all a calculated campaign to generate shock and win themselves over new fans.
[2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:13.440]  Well, I reckon that theory might be more plausible if they hadn't just cancelled the showing.
[2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:19.440]  It was put to show in all movie theaters. They pulled it from the internet or they tried to pull it from the internet.
[2:01:19.440 --> 2:01:27.440]  But, of course, lots of people, like I imagine some of your listeners, made copies of it and kept reposting it behind firewalls if they needed to,
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:38.440]  to protect it from being censored. Because this is a fantastic document for those of us who believe that the Eco-Fascist movement is a real danger.
[2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:43.440]  This is the evidence that we need it. Before that, they've been quite kind.
[2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:51.440]  They say they're a danger. They say they want world population reduction. And this is public domain that it had so much taxpayer money in it,
[2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:56.440]  as you've reported, from the local town councils. And this was to be put out as a public service announcement.
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:01:59.440]  They have no right to pull it now. We have a right to show it.
[2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:09.440]  I agree. But, you know, you say that they say this stuff, they do. I mean, if anyone bothered to read any of the key texts of the Green Movement,
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:13.440]  they are quite explicit about what they want to do with world population.
[2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:19.440]  But in much the same ways, you know, when Hitler in Mein Kampf made it absolutely clear what he wanted,
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:25.440]  that he wanted to destroy the Slavic intervention, that he wanted to wipe out the Jews, you know, he made no bones about this.
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:32.440]  But people didn't listen because people wanted to believe that the guy was a bit of a joke and soon reason would prevail.
[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:39.440]  You know, in the same way with the modern Green Movement, people want to believe that they are good. People project their ideas.
[2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:44.440]  And the left liked Hitler. They thought he was sexy and cool and could get things done.
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:49.440]  Well, of course they did. And of course, you know, fascism was part of a global trend.
[2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:53.440]  You know, even America had its own form of fascism under FDR.
[2:02:53.440 --> 2:02:59.440]  So, you know, Italy had the Mussolini. These were all movements, essentially, of the left.
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:07.440]  And they were all about control. They were all sort of about, you know, this view, the controlling view of society,
[2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:11.440]  that we should all be regimented and forced to behave in a particular way.
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:19.440]  And if it's not entirely characteristic of the Green Movement, they want to police how we dispose of our trash,
[2:03:19.440 --> 2:03:25.440]  what kind of cars we drive, what kind of food we eat, where it comes from, how many food brands we have.
[2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:30.440]  And of course, they'll have to survey it and tax it to make sure we're doing what they say.
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:40.440]  Yeah, exactly. And so, as you said, really the scariest thing of all this is what is going on in our children's classrooms.
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:44.440]  They are all getting taught this rubbish. They're all getting indoctrinated.
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:51.440]  And so, again, that video was quite revealing. It showed kids being taught by the teacher,
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:57.440]  particularly of the world, and those children who dissent, what happens to them? Well, they die.
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:02.440]  And there's literally hundreds of free video games online and games taught in school where you kill the humans,
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:09.440]  you kill the carbon blobs. I mean, I see new ones every day like this, what's it called, Super Megaworm on iTunes,
[2:04:09.440 --> 2:04:17.440]  for free, where you run around killing people. I mean, it's teaching kids, desensitizing them, to literally be psychopathic killers.
[2:04:17.440 --> 2:04:22.440]  I mean, the Army, 50 years ago, came out with paper pop-up targets,
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:25.440]  because they found a lot of troops up close wouldn't kill a fellow human.
[2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:30.440]  But they learned by desensitizing, shooting paper targets, that got up to almost 90%.
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:37.440]  The video game Doom, the Pentagon financed for up-close killing, and it's almost 99% now.
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:42.440]  One more segment, 15-minute segment with James Dillingpole will take a few of your calls.
[2:04:42.440 --> 2:04:49.440]  I want to come back and play just a clip of the children being murdered, bloodily, like out of a slasher movie,
[2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:53.440]  by the loving teacher. She lovingly does it and everybody goes about their business.
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:04:58.440]  This is what has to be done for Earth. We must kill people. It's loving, it's good, it's liberal.
[2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:00.440]  We'll be right back with James Dillingpole.
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:04.440]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:08.440]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company,
[2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:13.440]  a family-owned and operated American company. My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners
[2:05:13.440 --> 2:05:18.440]  are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:23.440]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:28.440]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091,
[2:05:28.440 --> 2:05:32.440]  or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[2:05:32.440 --> 2:05:36.440]  Let's talk to the owner of 5-star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:42.440]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:46.440]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:55.440]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 to visit our website, 5starsoap.com,
[2:05:55.440 --> 2:06:00.440]  providing a one to two-month soap sampler. Thank you.
[2:06:00.440 --> 2:06:05.440]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:08.440]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[2:06:08.440 --> 2:06:11.440]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system
[2:06:11.440 --> 2:06:16.440]  and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:21.440]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[2:06:21.440 --> 2:06:25.440]  Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:29.440]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:33.440]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:41.440]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:45.440]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system
[2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:51.440]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[2:06:51.440 --> 2:06:55.440]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[2:06:55.440 --> 2:06:59.440]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[2:06:59.440 --> 2:07:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:08.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:14.440]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:07:14.440 --> 2:07:20.440]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:24.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:07:24.440 --> 2:07:28.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:07:28.440 --> 2:07:31.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:35.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:07:35.440 --> 2:07:40.440]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:49.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:51.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:07:51.440 --> 2:07:59.440]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:08:01.440 --> 2:08:08.440]  Right kids, just before you go, I just need to press this little button here.
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:20.440]  This is the opiate of control freaks.
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:24.440]  Blood everywhere, climate change, the final solution.
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:34.440]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:08:34.440 --> 2:08:42.440]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:08:42.440 --> 2:08:49.440]  Well, if that isn't really showing you the fact that we are waging war on corruption, that is corruption.
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:55.440]  James Dillingpole, I want to go to some phone calls, but a lot of other key points you've been making about these people.
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:03.440]  As they get more and more routed and more and more delirious and angry, what do you expect them to do?
[2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:06.440]  More people shooting their newborn baby and then shooting themselves.
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:12.440]  More people taking over Discovery Channel and the SWAT team having to take them out before they can kill.
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:18.440]  I mean, just more of their armies going out and seeing video like this and trying to kill people.
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:20.440]  Yeah, well, you look pretty this way.
[2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:23.440]  The Unibob isn't going to be the last AK terrorist, is he?
[2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:30.440]  I mean, of course it's going to get worse and worse because these people believe they have justice on their side.
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:33.440]  They have Mother Gaia on their side for goodness sakes.
[2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:35.440]  So how can they be doing any wrong?
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:39.440]  They're doing it for the planet, Alex. They care.
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:44.440]  And while you're talking, I'm going to show folks one more time the intro.
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:48.440]  In fact, we can pump the audio up if you want to the super mega worm.
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:53.440]  And it's showing the planet Earth being killed by humans.
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:10:02.440]  And it shows the Earth going from green to brown and then black until the mega worm arrives to remove the scourge of the humans.
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:06.440]  Mother Earth is dying, it says. I'm reading the text.
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:09.440]  Her last defense has been unleashed.
[2:10:09.440 --> 2:10:16.440]  The super mega worm, the great death worm, killing police, killing children,
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:22.440]  children running, being eaten, people running, being eaten, smashing cars, attacking army tanks.
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:26.440]  When the children fly in the air, it fires fire from its mouth to burn them.
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:29.440]  There's extra points for killing children.
[2:10:29.440 --> 2:10:33.440]  I mean, there's really an obsession with killing people here, James.
[2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:37.440]  What do these people think is going to happen when all the humans are gone?
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:39.440]  Who's going to be here to observe it?
[2:10:39.440 --> 2:10:44.440]  All the teeming wildlife that's going to emerge in this human-free planet?
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:45.440]  Who's going to be there?
[2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:48.440]  Given that animals don't have any consciousness,
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:52.440]  these animals aren't going to be writing Shakespeare, are they?
[2:10:52.440 --> 2:10:54.440]  Or sort of building the Taj Mahal.
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:11:01.440]  They're just going to be killing each other, fighting for space and killing each other.
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:05.440]  It's incredible. Let's go to some phone calls and quick questions or comments, folks,
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:07.440]  because I want to get to everybody.
[2:11:07.440 --> 2:11:08.440]  I ought to get the phone number.
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:09.440]  The lines are loaded.
[2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:12.440]  800-259-9231.
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:16.440]  Pastor in Ohio, you're on the air while you're still alive
[2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:19.440]  before the great death worm comes and gets you.
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:20.440]  Go ahead.
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:24.440]  I'm just happy to be alive after everything I've been spreading around.
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:29.440]  Hey, I've called you before about the password response table.
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:31.440]  Now I've got something else for you.
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:34.440]  It's called Snapscouts. Keep America safe.
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:41.440]  It's using kids to take pictures with their cameras and stuff to send it in.
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:42.440]  Okay, I'm going to do this.
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  I want to put you on hold because this guy gave us the secret Homeland Security documents
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:49.440]  five years ago that later came out on mainstream news where they're secretly recruiting
[2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:52.440]  50,000 preachers to spy on their flocks.
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:56.440]  I'm going to come back to you after the break when Mr. Dillingpole leaves his pastor.
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:11:58.440]  I want to hear about, what do you say, snap?
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:01.440]  Bring him back up for a second in case he drops.
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:02.440]  What's the name of it?
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:03.440]  Snapscouts?
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:05.440]  Yes, Snapscouts.
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:08.440]  You can just type that in and bring it up and hit the first one on the...
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:09.440]  Oh, that reminds me.
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:14.440]  What was that thing that came out where you eco-tattle and take snapshots and then report it,
[2:12:14.440 --> 2:12:17.440]  but post it on a website like Buildings with their lights on?
[2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:19.440]  James, what was the name of that?
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:20.440]  I know about that one.
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:22.440]  I know about the trash cans.
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:28.440]  We now have the spying devices to monitor about how much trash we dispose of.
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:30.440]  And now that's being exported here.
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:31.440]  Thank you, Pastor.
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:32.440]  We're going to come back to you after James leaves.
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:34.440]  This is questions for our guests on this issue.
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:38.440]  Tony and Jersey, you're on the air.
[2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:39.440]  Hey, Alex.
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:40.440]  How's it going?
[2:12:40.440 --> 2:12:43.440]  Just want to thank you for all you've been doing, all your hard work.
[2:12:43.440 --> 2:12:44.440]  Keep it up.
[2:12:44.440 --> 2:12:47.440]  Just wanted to make a couple of points.
[2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:52.440]  We've got all the evidence we need to show people.
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:57.440]  I really think that the main objective here is raising awareness.
[2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:02.440]  And I was wondering what you would think about doing something like a creed amongst a lot
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:04.440]  of maybe celebrities and stuff.
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:07.440]  I know you like to keep it more about the people.
[2:13:07.440 --> 2:13:12.440]  But by doing a creed amongst celebrities and having something that he could all agree on
[2:13:12.440 --> 2:13:14.440]  and maybe find off on you.
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:15.440]  Sure.
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:17.440]  I mean, I'm anti-death.
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:19.440]  I'm anti-dark age.
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:21.440]  What does the back of my film Endgame say?
[2:13:21.440 --> 2:13:23.440]  It says, they want you dead.
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:24.440]  I'm not making this up.
[2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:25.440]  They want us dead.
[2:13:25.440 --> 2:13:27.440]  People need to see this film, but that's a good idea.
[2:13:27.440 --> 2:13:33.440]  What would we call ourselves if we're for progress, we're for a clean environment, but
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:35.440]  we don't want to kill children?
[2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:36.440]  James?
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:42.440]  Well, I think the only way we can punish these people is to use the market to punish them.
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:47.440]  I don't believe in asking big governments to ban things because I don't think big government
[2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:51.440]  needs to be encouraged in any way whatsoever to exert more control over our lives.
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:58.440]  But I do very much believe that, for example, when Radiohead lend their music to this kind
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:00.440]  of crap, that they should be punished for it.
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:02.440]  People should stop buying Radiohead records.
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:07.440]  People should stop going to see Richard Curtis' movies, you know, given that he's producing
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:09.440]  this poisonous eco-fascist propaganda.
[2:14:09.440 --> 2:14:12.440]  They should be punished in their wallets.
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:13.440]  And go to your local schools.
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:14.440]  Don't let them.
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:15.440]  This has all been discredited.
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:20.440]  You know, I saw the Attorney General of Texas file suit on the government and try to block
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:24.440]  the carbon taxes, and he came out and said, this is a complete fraud.
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:26.440]  This is all based on a fraud.
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:30.440]  So we've got to get on the offensive against these people.
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:32.440]  Good points.
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:34.440]  Anything else, Tony?
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:35.440]  Yeah.
[2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:41.440]  You guys got Muse coming to Austin this weekend, and I was hoping maybe you guys could try
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:42.440]  and get them in studio.
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:47.440]  And going to Tom, I really think he's kind of a good guy, and Matt Bellamy from Muse.
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:51.440]  I know they're quite good friends, so I think that could be something you could work on.
[2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:53.440]  I want to be clear about Muse.
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:57.440]  One time we discovered Mr. Bellamy was here.
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:14:58.440]  I got him on.
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:14:59.440]  He's anti-New World Order.
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:00.440]  He's a fan of the show.
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:01.440]  He links.
[2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:05.440]  The only three links on his website are to Prison Planet Info Wars and Propaganda Matrix,
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:07.440]  all our group of sites.
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:10.440]  I can't, but I got his number, but it was a U.S.
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:11.440]  number.
[2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:15.440]  I didn't think to get the other one, and his management will not let him come on this show.
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:19.440]  So to Mr. Bellamy, hey, bro, get in contact with Info Wars.
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:21.440]  We want to have you on.
[2:15:21.440 --> 2:15:26.440]  I know you wanted to hook up sometime, but your management for some reason will not let us get through your blockade.
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:28.440]  I appreciate your call, Tony.
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:30.440]  Let's talk to Joseph in California.
[2:15:30.440 --> 2:15:34.440]  Joseph, you're on the air with Mr. Dillingpole from the Telegraph.
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:35.440]  Go ahead.
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:36.440]  Hey, Alex.
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:37.440]  How are you doing?
[2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:38.440]  Good.
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:39.440]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[2:15:39.440 --> 2:15:44.440]  Hey, I just want to let you know I heard today that the LA Unified School District is requiring
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:48.440]  all their students to give their fingerprints to get their school lunches.
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:50.440]  No, that's going on everywhere.
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:52.440]  It's to track everything you're doing.
[2:15:52.440 --> 2:15:54.440]  Any comments on the environment?
[2:15:54.440 --> 2:16:00.440]  You know, I think it's just all part of the whole thing is to control grid, kind of get these kids all
[2:16:00.440 --> 2:16:04.440]  acclimated to being controlled and manipulated by the government.
[2:16:04.440 --> 2:16:09.440]  And second of all, thank you for being a patriot, and thank you for waking people up.
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:13.440]  You've helped me to wake up so many of my friends through all your information on your websites,
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:15.440]  and you are a true patriot, my friend.
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:16.440]  Well, thank you, sir.
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:19.440]  Look, I have no future if we don't beat these people, and neither do you or anybody.
[2:16:19.440 --> 2:16:20.440]  Thank you, Joseph.
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:22.440]  We found the name of it.
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:27.440]  It's the EcoSnoop, and it's got thousands of postings on its front page of their neighbors
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:29.440]  saying, look, their garden is unkept.
[2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:30.440]  EcoSnoop.
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:33.440]  This place has some lights on at night.
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:34.440]  Well, people may be working.
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:36.440]  In fact, go to the front page of EcoSnoop.
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:39.440]  It's actually got, you know, the photos and tattletails section.
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:40.440]  I want to show that.
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:41.440]  So that's something for you, James.
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:42.440]  EcoSnoop.
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:43.440]  What do you think of that?
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:44.440]  I think we should all make it our business, Alex.
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:48.440]  I think we should all try here and now to get ourselves snooped on EcoSnoop.
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:52.440]  I think we should wear it as a badge of honor if our neighbor catches us with our lights
[2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:54.440]  on, burning through the night.
[2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:56.440]  That should be a badge of honor.
[2:16:56.440 --> 2:16:57.440]  Absolutely.
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:16:59.440]  In fact, I want to be on the top of the EcoSnoop list.
[2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:00.440]  No, I do.
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:01.440]  I do.
[2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:04.440]  I mean, we're supposed to, I guess, freeze in the dark or something.
[2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:06.440]  A couple more quick calls with James Dillingpole.
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:09.440]  JamesDillingpole.com, of course, is the website.
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:10.440]  When's the new book coming out?
[2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:12.440]  Because I want to get you on when that comes out.
[2:17:12.440 --> 2:17:13.440]  You so do, Alex.
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:16.440]  Your listeners are going to totally love it.
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:21.440]  It is called Watermelon, and it is about the EcoFascist conspiracy about how it all started,
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:23.440]  what they believe, stuff like that.
[2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:24.440]  I don't know.
[2:17:24.440 --> 2:17:29.440]  I mean, I'm going to bring it out reasonably soon, maybe before Christmas, I hope.
[2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:30.440]  Absolutely.
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:33.440]  Let's go ahead now and go quickly.
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:35.440]  Frank in New York, you're on the air with James Dillingpole.
[2:17:35.440 --> 2:17:36.440]  EcoCriminal.
[2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:38.440]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:40.440]  Good afternoon, James.
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:43.440]  Congratulations on your work, both of you.
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:49.440]  What I wanted to say is this, I find it comical that the Prince of Wales can point his finger
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:57.440]  at people for taking a bath in cold climates, yet he has over 26 of states and lived a lavish lifestyle
[2:17:57.440 --> 2:17:59.440]  that's bad at the waste drill.
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:09.440]  And I think right now, since the issues are before the world elite regarding eugenics,
[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:15.440]  I think right now it's time for the masses to start to demand that those such as the Rothschilds,
[2:18:15.440 --> 2:18:21.440]  the Rockefellers, the Windsors, all of those individuals that are behind this,
[2:18:21.440 --> 2:18:24.440]  and that really have taken the heart of the world.
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  How about they cut first?
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:28.440]  That's a great point.
[2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:31.440]  I mean, this has been pointed out a lot, but how about they cut first?
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:34.440]  I mean, if this is really going to happen, James.
[2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:39.440]  Yeah, I really noticed, you know, Tom York flying less than all these people.
[2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:40.440]  He's eco-free.
[2:18:40.440 --> 2:18:41.440]  He's eco-celebrities.
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:46.440]  I've noticed how they've really reigned in on their travel, on their flights and stuff.
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:47.440]  Not.
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:51.440]  I mean, Prince Charles, you know, he's constantly flying over to Rio and places like that
[2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:53.440]  to talk about the peril facing the world.
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:54.440]  Well, you know...
[2:18:54.440 --> 2:19:00.440]  Well, he'll have a few stunts where he holograms into Austin from one of his estates to save fuel,
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:02.440]  but then he's still traveling.
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:03.440]  He does a few stunts.
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:04.440]  He does that.
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:06.440]  And don't forget, he's got a massive entourage.
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:09.440]  You know, he's got his posse, his royal posse.
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:10.440]  He'll go with him.
[2:19:10.440 --> 2:19:11.440]  You know, he's...
[2:19:11.440 --> 2:19:14.440]  No, he's very much part of the problem, I think.
[2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:17.440]  Well, I'll tell you what, I'm going to come back to Tony and then Frank,
[2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:20.440]  because Frank had had enough time, and then Dave and John.
[2:19:20.440 --> 2:19:23.440]  We're going to let James Dillingpole go, but as soon as Watermelons comes out,
[2:19:23.440 --> 2:19:25.440]  we want to get you on the broadcast.
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:29.440]  But do you agree with me that we're really starting to turn the tide against him?
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:34.440]  We're turning the tide on this particular one, but believe me,
[2:19:34.440 --> 2:19:39.440]  they are going to find different ways, you know, be it biodiversity or ocean acidification.
[2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:43.440]  They will never stop on their quest to increase their control,
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:46.440]  increase their taxation, increase, you know, regulation,
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:48.440]  because this is essentially what they're about.
[2:19:48.440 --> 2:19:49.440]  They hate freedom.
[2:19:49.440 --> 2:19:50.440]  They really do.
[2:19:50.440 --> 2:19:53.440]  They're authoritarian, masquerading in a green jumpsuit.
[2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:55.440]  God bless you, Mr. Dillingpole.
[2:19:55.440 --> 2:19:56.440]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[2:19:56.440 --> 2:19:57.440]  Bye-bye.
[2:19:57.440 --> 2:20:00.440]  You're called straight ahead. Tons of news. Stay with us. Transmission continues.
[2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:32.440]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use SinoFresh.
[2:20:57.440 --> 2:21:04.440]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:32.440]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use SinoFresh.
[2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:04.440]  Gold. If you listen to the radio, watch TV or surf the net, you're hearing about gold.
[2:22:04.440 --> 2:22:07.440]  Eventually you will ask yourself, is gold right for me?
[2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:08.440]  The answer might surprise you.
[2:22:08.440 --> 2:22:11.440]  We protect ourselves and our families from many things.
[2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:15.440]  Do you have medical insurance? Is your home insured? Do you carry life insurance?
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:16.440]  How about financial insurance?
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:18.440]  If you own gold, then the answer is yes.
[2:22:18.440 --> 2:22:22.440]  If you don't own gold, the question is why don't you have financial insurance?
[2:22:22.440 --> 2:22:24.440]  We put our faith in things we trust.
[2:22:24.440 --> 2:22:25.440]  Do you trust the dollar?
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:28.440]  Do you trust the economy? Do you trust the government?
[2:22:28.440 --> 2:22:30.440]  Gold has always been something you can trust.
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:33.440]  For thousands of years, people have put their faith in gold.
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:34.440]  Where will you put your faith?
[2:22:34.440 --> 2:22:37.440]  Now is the time to protect yourself and your family.

[2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:10.440]  By the way, I just got word we're going to have a special guest at the very start of the broadcast tomorrow
[2:24:10.440 --> 2:24:11.440]  with a lot of breaking info.
[2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:15.440]  I'm just going to leave it at that until tomorrow.
[2:24:15.440 --> 2:24:20.440]  If you want to join us, 11 a.m. Central Standard Time tomorrow.
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:25.440]  It's going to be extremely, extremely informative information.
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:31.440]  Now, to have continuity, I want to go back to Frank because we were just talking and then we're going to go to Pastor
[2:24:31.440 --> 2:24:35.440]  who we really pay attention to when he contacts because he's always got key intel.
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:39.440]  And do we find that snap scout thing, the new title tell program?
[2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:41.440]  Because last time it was a secret program he brought to us.
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:45.440]  But finishing up with Frank, sorry I got cut off by the break, Frank.
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:51.440]  You're saying the eugenics is out in the open and you've got all these people worth trillions of dollars combined
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:55.440]  who have these lavish lifestyles telling old ladies they can't take a hot bath.
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:56.440]  Go ahead.
[2:24:56.440 --> 2:25:00.440]  And also, Alex, I look at the situation like this.
[2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:04.440]  Since these are the people that want eugenics and supported it,
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:08.440]  I think they should be the first ones that should really go into the plan
[2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:12.440]  and they should realize that most of their lives have been waste rolls.
[2:25:12.440 --> 2:25:14.440]  I mean, they've been waste rolls.
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:16.440]  They've squandered tremendous wealth.
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:18.440]  They've caused many social problems.
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:26.440]  And I'm going to say this, that the DuPonts, the Rothschilds, the Nobel, the Rockefellers, Al Gore's,
[2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:33.440]  Ant's company, a major shareholder in Occidental Petroleum, Hooker Chemical,
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:36.440]  these people have raped the environment for generations.
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:38.440]  They've been profited by it.
[2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:44.440]  And I think if we're going to have a green global plan with a carbon signature,
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:51.440]  these people's assets should be taken and used to pay for this rather than the poor and the individual.
[2:25:51.440 --> 2:25:53.440]  Well, I've got a better idea.
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:25:56.440]  Let's discredit them with that obvious hypocrisy,
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:25:59.440]  but then let's have courts of law for all the crimes they've committed
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:02.440]  and their open conspiracy for a tyrannical world government.
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:07.440]  Let's bring them to justice and then take their wealth and pay off the debts
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:09.440]  they've created and put on our backs.
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:12.440]  How about we do that through the court of law?
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:17.440]  And it would be very easy for the IRS to look at the trusts that were set up
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:19.440]  prior to the income tax and the Federal Reserve.
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:21.440]  Which made them exempt from it.
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:22.440]  They got all that exactly.
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:24.440]  The IRS could do is look at it and say,
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:27.440]  oh, all the taxes you owe in penalties.
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:29.440]  Therefore, that wealth immediately would be wiped out,
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:31.440]  just with the interest with the penalties.
[2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:34.440]  And I think that's the lesson that should really be brought.
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:38.440]  It's too bad that, and I'm wondering too, with this plan,
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:42.440]  does the super elite, most of their children aren't that bright?
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:46.440]  And the point is this, the people that make new wealth
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:49.440]  are often people of the working and the poor in the middle class
[2:26:49.440 --> 2:26:52.440]  that work and that have a different work ethic.
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:57.440]  And I'm wondering who do the elite think is going to do the cooking
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:01.440]  while their publications say they're going to have a tiny 500 million population
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:03.440]  that is biologically designed.
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:05.440]  That's a Pentagon official report.
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:06.440]  In fact, where's that big binder?
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:07.440]  Here it is.
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:08.440]  Here it is.
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:11.440]  This report put out two years ago that Beck's finally covering.
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:14.440]  National Intelligence Council Global Trends 2025,
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:18.440]  a transformed world they say will be suboid brainwashed drug creatures
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:20.440]  that serve them for national security.
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:23.440]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:25.440]  It's online, folks, on the Pentagon.
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:28.440]  And so there'll be 500 million of us.
[2:27:28.440 --> 2:27:31.440]  The rest will be robots, drones, drone aircraft,
[2:27:31.440 --> 2:27:33.440]  just a tiny world of their servants.
[2:27:33.440 --> 2:27:36.440]  And then they also talk about, once they phase out of that,
[2:27:36.440 --> 2:27:41.440]  they're seriously discussing only bringing it down to a few thousand people.
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:43.440]  Yeah, and I think that's utterly ridiculous.
[2:27:43.440 --> 2:27:48.440]  And what I think should be done is that those such as Prince Philip
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:52.440]  that at the 1994 wildlife, World Wildlife Bank,
[2:27:52.440 --> 2:27:56.440]  that said that he wants to be reincarnated as the Ebola virus,
[2:27:56.440 --> 2:27:58.440]  so he can destroy two billion people.
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:03.440]  Well, if that isn't an arrogant, non-human kind of philosophy,
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:08.440]  I mean, it goes to show what happens when people are living way beyond their means,
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:11.440]  and by their means, they're not producing anything.
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:14.440]  Well, they're parasites, so they have disgust for the host.
[2:28:14.440 --> 2:28:18.440]  But if you study elites, it didn't matter if it's Asia, Europe, Latin America,
[2:28:18.440 --> 2:28:24.440]  Mesoamerica, any powerful elite, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20 generations down,
[2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:28.440]  become complete, inbred, psychopathic lunatics that just start killing everybody,
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:30.440]  because that's their only enjoyment.
[2:28:30.440 --> 2:28:34.440]  And a lot of times, people like Nero and others commit suicide.
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:38.440]  In fact, the philosophers, I have some of these quotes in Endgame,
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:42.440]  of the globalist, some of the top transhumanist philosophers just say,
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:45.440]  I will destroy the earth for my go-on willing.
[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:47.440]  I will kill myself. I will kill others.
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:51.440]  They get into just this infantile...
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:54.440]  I mean, it's not enough to be into gross sexual stuff.
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:57.440]  It's not enough to have wars and kill masses of people.
[2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:02.440]  Lenin wrote poetry about blowing the earth up, blowing the sun up.
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:06.440]  It's on record that he would have a little, little rowboat taking him over to an island
[2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:09.440]  where all these rabbits had bred, and he would just for hours run around
[2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:11.440]  with a shotgun shooting them and biting them.
[2:29:11.440 --> 2:29:15.440]  And there's a Clint Eastwood movie, I forget the name of it,
[2:29:15.440 --> 2:29:18.440]  where they're looking for bank robbery money that's hidden in a church.
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:21.440]  But there's a scene where they ask some guy on the side of the road for help,
[2:29:21.440 --> 2:29:24.440]  and he pulls up and pops the back of the truck open, or the car,
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:27.440]  and lets out all these white rabbits, and is running around shotgunning them.
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:29.440]  That's based on Lenin.
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:33.440]  Lenin would just for hours just murdering white rabbits.
[2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:35.440]  I mean, these people are completely nuts.
[2:29:35.440 --> 2:29:37.440]  I appreciate your call.
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:42.440]  We're going to come back with Pastor Dave, John, Jonathan, and many, many others,
[2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:44.440]  and a bunch of other news we haven't gotten to.
[2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:48.440]  We also have two news, key search terms today that are key.
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:51.440]  To get out to everyone, we'll tell you those on the other side. Stay with us.
[2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:54.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.

[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:16.440]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[2:31:16.440 --> 2:31:21.440]  Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans

[2:31:29.440 --> 2:31:32.440]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[2:31:32.440 --> 2:31:34.440]  Where you need it most
[2:31:34.440 --> 2:31:37.440]  Blue diamond gussets got it

[2:33:07.440 --> 2:33:10.440]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[2:33:16.440 --> 2:33:21.440]  Well, I want to thank a pastor who always gives us good intel, secret intel
[2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:27.440]  This is public intel on the snapscouts.org
[2:33:27.440 --> 2:33:30.440]  And we're reprinting The New York Times, oh they already got it
[2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:33.440]  The guys are, and the girls are so good
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:36.440]  They just get stuff so fast, now I've never had a team this good
[2:33:36.440 --> 2:33:38.440]  You guys and gals are awesome
[2:33:38.440 --> 2:33:41.440]  Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more
[2:33:41.440 --> 2:33:44.440]  Take on disgruntled veterans, hunt them down and kill them New York Times
[2:33:44.440 --> 2:33:45.440]  They say it's great
[2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:47.440]  Remember that from May 14, 2009
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:50.440]  And I had all these scout people calling it going, that's preposterous
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:53.440]  That's not going on then later, actually they are training us now
[2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:57.440]  See it, snap it, send it to Homeland Security
[2:33:57.440 --> 2:34:00.440]  And get badges and goodies
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:03.440]  And in my film Road to Tyranny
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:05.440]  I had the local TV ad where it says

[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:35.440]  And the Levi's split
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:37.440]  And I'm like Levi's didn't used to do this
[2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:39.440]  When they were made in America
[2:36:39.440 --> 2:36:41.440]  Or fat or something

[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  Is something suspicious, snap it
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:03.440]  And send it to Homeland Security
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:05.440]  Mommy's taken
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:07.440]  Pills, did mommy yell at you?
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:09.440]  Did mommy smoke in funny smelling
[2:39:09.440 --> 2:39:11.440]  Cigarettes? Did she smoke in the car with you?

[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:29.440]  I can't take this anymore
[2:39:29.440 --> 2:39:31.440]  Naked body scanners
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:33.440]  Scanners blasting our houses
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:35.440]  Bloodsucking checkpoints
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:37.440]  By the way, the Google search terms today
[2:39:37.440 --> 2:39:39.440]  Deal with this terror hysteria
[2:39:39.440 --> 2:39:41.440]  Is the one search term to put in Google over and over again
[2:39:41.440 --> 2:39:43.440]  They hate it, so keep doing it
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:45.440]  And the other second search term is October surprise terror
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:47.440]  Dealing with Paul Joseph Watson's
[2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:49.440]  October surprise terror hysteria
[2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:51.440]  Recycled in election ploy
[2:39:51.440 --> 2:39:53.440]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:55.440]  They have this image of this sweet little
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:39:57.440]  Eight-year-old or so
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:39:59.440]  Smiling there happily with all
[2:39:59.440 --> 2:40:01.440]  That wonderment in the eye
[2:40:01.440 --> 2:40:03.440]  The cartoon is really captured
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:05.440]  How sweet the youth are
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:07.440]  Turning them into horrid little Nazi enforcers
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:09.440]  And here's the New York Times
[2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:11.440]  They're training them by age 14
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:13.440]  To take on that disgruntled vet
[2:40:13.440 --> 2:40:15.440]  Move in, take him out, rogue leader
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:17.440]  Hitler, youth forward
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:19.440]  Take out the US vets
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:21.440]  Israeli, spy on them for us
[2:40:21.440 --> 2:40:23.440]  Spying on Ron Paul, bring them down right now
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:25.440]  This is freedom
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:27.440]  The government didn't stage the terror
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:29.440]  Care about us
[2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:33.440]  The government needed to inject
[2:40:33.440 --> 2:40:35.440]  Children with syphilis
[2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:37.440]  In the US and in Guatemala
[2:40:37.440 --> 2:40:39.440]  That's freedom
[2:40:39.440 --> 2:40:41.440]  Hey kids, why don't you spy on the government
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:43.440]  Why don't you videotape corrupt police
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:45.440]  Why don't you get involved at school
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:47.440]  And report on the web
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:49.440]  The tyranny and oppression and brainwashing
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:51.440]  Why don't you join the Republic
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:53.440]  And George Washington in 1776
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:55.440]  And beat these people
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:57.440]  And we've got our patriot spies
[2:40:57.440 --> 2:40:59.440]  Out there who report on tyranny
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:01.440]  People like pastor in Ohio
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:03.440]  We've got a homeland security visit
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:05.440]  After he leaked us hundreds of pages
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:07.440]  Of secret documents about preachers being trained
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:09.440]  Tell your flocks go to the FEMA camp when told
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:11.440]  To take the force to an oculation
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:13.440]  To turn their guns in, Romans 13
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:15.440]  And two years after he sent Butchpaugh
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:17.440]  And myself that
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:19.440]  It came out on mainstream news
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:21.440]  The number one enemy of the US government
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:23.440]  Is us, the people, that's a quote
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:25.440]  From the TV station
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:27.440]  And they talk to members and they say
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:29.440]  We do what the Lord says during martial law
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:31.440]  And they cut the footage of people in the camp
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:33.440]  So the preacher goes, it's of the Lord
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:35.440]  That guy's YouTube clergy response
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:37.440]  People won't believe it, I'm going to play it
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:39.440]  We cover it in police state
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:41.440]  For the rise of FEMA
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:43.440]  But you've been holding long enough pastor
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:45.440]  What do you think of this latest thing
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:47.440]  About how to tattle and spy on everyone
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:49.440]  Well, one of the biggest things I noticed
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:51.440]  When I brought it up was that
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:53.440]  First of all, it's in cartoon form
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:55.440]  So that goes right straight to the kids
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:41:57.440]  Then it chose the
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:41:59.440]  Little buck to his boy with his hat on
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:01.440]  Holding an American flag
[2:42:01.440 --> 2:42:03.440]  And it chose his mom and his dad
[2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:05.440]  Just totally startled and scared to death
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:07.440]  With their heads popped through the door
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:09.440]  Yeah, the doorway there behind him
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:11.440]  With eyes, their eyes
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:13.440]  All bugged out and everything
[2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:15.440]  Because they're about half scared
[2:42:15.440 --> 2:42:17.440]  Of what he's going to do or what he's going to say
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:19.440]  But you know, all this is expected
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:21.440]  I mean, I'll tell you what
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:23.440]  Since I've talked to you
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:25.440]  I told you last time I talked to you
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:27.440]  It's been a while that I was going to start
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:29.440]  A black rope brigade
[2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:31.440]  Here in Ohio
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:33.440]  Now, whether you believe it or not
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:35.440]  Out of all the pastors
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:37.440]  That I've talked to
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:39.440]  In my area
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:41.440]  I cannot get one
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:43.440]  Single, one
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:45.440]  I'm bored
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:47.440]  So I just started talking to the people
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:49.440]  I figured, well, you know what
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:51.440]  If the shepherd isn't going to take care of his own sheep
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:53.440]  Then I'll start telling his sheep
[2:42:53.440 --> 2:42:55.440]  What the heck's going on
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:57.440]  All the world council of churches, you and run devils
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:42:59.440]  All they care about is their Cadillac in their house
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:01.440]  But look, I'll expand
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:03.440]  It says this is a private company
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:05.440]  That probably sells this data
[2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:07.440]  We don't know to the government
[2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:09.440]  It's like pizza place to spy on you
[2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:11.440]  When you order with your address and name
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:13.440]  Off the fines and fees
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:15.440]  But it says it was developed by many true LLC
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:17.440]  Created by George Parsons
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:19.440]  And Winston O'Brien
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:21.440]  And it leverages modern technology to address
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:23.440]  The timeless threats to democracy and freedom
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:25.440]  How about having kids running around
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:27.440]  With telescreens
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:29.440]  Spying on everybody
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:31.440]  How about that being a threat to freedom
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:33.440]  And maybe these guys are useful idiots
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:35.440]  But in my opinion, this is pure evil
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:37.440]  Go ahead
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:39.440]  Okay, well, there's something else
[2:43:39.440 --> 2:43:41.440]  And as a matter of fact, I've got two of them
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:43.440]  I got them in front of me
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:45.440]  As soon as I got out, I was going to shred it
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:47.440]  And I thought, well, that's what I did last time
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:49.440]  To the first one, and I had to wait until I got the second one
[2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:51.440]  Before I got ahold of you
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:43:53.440]  From the Hartford Institute
[2:43:53.440 --> 2:43:55.440]  For religious research
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:43:57.440]  They have sent out a 2010
[2:43:57.440 --> 2:43:59.440]  National survey of
[2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:01.440]  Churches
[2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:03.440]  And it's about one, two, three, four, five
[2:44:03.440 --> 2:44:05.440]  Six pages long
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:07.440]  They send you the envelope to send it back in
[2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:09.440]  But their questions
[2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:11.440]  Are running along these lines here
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:13.440]  Like
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:15.440]  What is the estimated
[2:44:15.440 --> 2:44:17.440]  Percent
[2:44:17.440 --> 2:44:19.440]  Of your regular participants
[2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:21.440]  But then, some of the other questions they ask
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:23.440]  Like, do they listen to what you say?
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:25.440]  They ask those type of questions
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:27.440]  And you've got to answer them
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:29.440]  Never sell them
[2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:31.440]  Sometimes, often, always
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:33.440]  They want to know if you're a close knit family
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:35.440]  That's what they're asking now
[2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:37.440]  And most of these
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:39.440]  From what I have found out
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:41.440]  Are not being sent
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:43.440]  To your mainline denomination churches
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:45.440]  They are being sent
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:47.440]  To your non-denomination churches
[2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:49.440]  It's intel spying
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:51.440]  They admit their spine on the churches
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:53.440]  The state reps, this criminal government
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:55.440]  That isn't elected, this bureaucracy
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:44:57.440]  They're taking over now
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:44:59.440]  But going back to this
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:01.440]  Folks, it doesn't get any more bonafide
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:03.440]  Than having kids spy on everybody
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:05.440]  To take on vets
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:07.440]  It doesn't get any more evil
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:09.440]  Than having preachers secretly prepare their flocks
[2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:11.440]  For all of this corruption
[2:45:11.440 --> 2:45:13.440]  And I'm not going to get into it
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:15.440]  But my parents go to a nice Methodist church
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:17.440]  I'd probably been there 50 times
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:19.440]  My kids more
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:21.440]  And the Methodist church
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:23.440]  Then sent the one preacher
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:25.440]  That's how it works to another church
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:27.440]  And suddenly it was
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:29.440]  Cut your carbon
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:31.440]  The illegal aliens must be legalized
[2:45:31.440 --> 2:45:33.440]  And the money for Bill and Melinda Gates
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:35.440]  And my kids
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:37.440]  Aren't going back to that church
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:39.440]  And the sad thing is
[2:45:39.440 --> 2:45:41.440]  My mom starts helping with the church
[2:45:41.440 --> 2:45:43.440]  Volunteering, doing Sunday school
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:45.440]  She has friends there
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:47.440]  And my parents don't like it
[2:45:47.440 --> 2:45:49.440]  But they've got to get out of it
[2:45:49.440 --> 2:45:51.440]  It's so sick to sit there
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:53.440]  And to have stuff like this going on
[2:45:53.440 --> 2:45:55.440]  It's at Baptist, it's at Methodist
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:45:57.440]  It's at Catholic, people sent me the Catholic church stuff
[2:45:57.440 --> 2:45:59.440]  Where they tell them, turn your guns in
[2:45:59.440 --> 2:46:01.440]  You know, one was
[2:46:01.440 --> 2:46:03.440]  In Chicago, Paris, I saw that with
[2:46:03.440 --> 2:46:05.440]  I mean, this is disgusting
[2:46:05.440 --> 2:46:07.440]  There's a separation of church and state
[2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:09.440]  And the churches have been taken
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:11.440]  Over by and large
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:13.440]  And folks, if your church is promoting
[2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:15.440]  Bill and Melinda Gates eugenics
[2:46:15.440 --> 2:46:17.440]  But telling you it's helping little black children
[2:46:17.440 --> 2:46:19.440]  Or they're telling you legalize the illegals
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:21.440]  Or that guns are evil, or carbon footprint garbage
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:23.440]  Get out of it, get out of it
[2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:25.440]  And take people with you, form real churches
[2:46:25.440 --> 2:46:27.440]  But pastor, are you saying
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:29.440]  You're starting to have success
[2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:31.440]  You're starting to have success is what you're saying
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:33.440]  Or am I wrong, by just going out
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:35.440]  Like Jesus did, he didn't go get the Pharisees
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:37.440]  And Sadducees and all of them
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:39.440]  He went out to fishermen, he went out to carpenters
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:41.440]  He went out to tax collectors
[2:46:41.440 --> 2:46:43.440]  He found his army of people
[2:46:43.440 --> 2:46:45.440]  To wake folks up on the streets
[2:46:45.440 --> 2:46:47.440]  And in the fields, I mean
[2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:49.440]  Are you having some success?
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:51.440]  Absolutely, and matter of fact
[2:46:51.440 --> 2:46:53.440]  Like I said, I just gave up
[2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:55.440]  On these two-faced, money-loving
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:57.440]  Preachers standing before the flocks
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:46:59.440]  Even in some of them are my friends
[2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:01.440]  And that's just, that just
[2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:03.440]  Disappoints me more than anything else
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:05.440]  But I started talking to the people
[2:47:05.440 --> 2:47:07.440]  I gave them my email address
[2:47:07.440 --> 2:47:09.440]  Told them what I'm doing
[2:47:09.440 --> 2:47:11.440]  I'm trying to get the word out and everything
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:13.440]  Well, just a week and a half ago
[2:47:13.440 --> 2:47:15.440]  I had someone get a hold of me
[2:47:15.440 --> 2:47:17.440]  That goes to a local church
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:19.440]  And lo and behold, the pastor
[2:47:19.440 --> 2:47:21.440]  Standing right up there in front of the group
[2:47:21.440 --> 2:47:23.440]  And on Sunday morning
[2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:25.440]  And telling them
[2:47:25.440 --> 2:47:27.440]  The Romans 13
[2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:29.440]  Just like it was supposed to
[2:47:29.440 --> 2:47:31.440]  Like we were told to do
[2:47:31.440 --> 2:47:33.440]  And that's because they get the
[2:47:33.440 --> 2:47:35.440]  Faith-based money
[2:47:35.440 --> 2:47:37.440]  Yeah, they got the faith-based money
[2:47:37.440 --> 2:47:39.440]  And matter of fact, not only did they
[2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:41.440]  Get that, they got a lump sum
[2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:43.440]  To even start the church
[2:47:43.440 --> 2:47:45.440]  So these people, I got
[2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:47.440]  The fans are starting the church
[2:47:47.440 --> 2:47:49.440]  It's not just infiltrating
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:51.440]  God bless you, sir
[2:47:51.440 --> 2:47:53.440]  God bless you, what a great guy
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:55.440]  What a great intel source
[2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:57.440]  And over 50,000
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:47:59.440]  Preachers have been recruited by this
[2:47:59.440 --> 2:48:01.440]  Thousands and thousands others have gotten this
[2:48:01.440 --> 2:48:03.440]  And they're too scared to speak up
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:05.440]  Oh, I better tell people to turn their guns in
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:07.440]  It's for the Lord
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:09.440]  I'm in a free country
[2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:11.440]  Your children aren't safe folks under this
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:13.440]  Here is one newscast
[2:48:13.440 --> 2:48:15.440]  Saying we're the enemy
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:17.440]  The government's training us for martial law
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:19.440]  Here it is
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:21.440]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[2:48:21.440 --> 2:48:23.440]  Some fear any nuclear
[2:48:23.440 --> 2:48:25.440]  Biological or chemical attack
[2:48:25.440 --> 2:48:27.440]  On U.S. territory
[2:48:27.440 --> 2:48:29.440]  Might trigger just that
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:31.440]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Farrell discovered
[2:48:31.440 --> 2:48:33.440]  The clergy would help the government
[2:48:33.440 --> 2:48:35.440]  With potentially their biggest problem
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:37.440]  Us
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:39.440]  From my cold dead hand
[2:48:39.440 --> 2:48:41.440]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration
[2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:43.440]  Captures a truly American value
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:45.440]  The overarching desire
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:47.440]  To protect our freedoms
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:49.440]  But gun confiscation
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:51.440]  Is exactly what happened
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:53.440]  During the state of emergency
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:55.440]  Following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:48:57.440]  U.S. troops also arrived
[2:48:57.440 --> 2:48:59.440]  Something far easier to do even now
[2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:01.440]  Thanks to last year's elimination
[2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:03.440]  Of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:05.440]  That forbid U.S. troops
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:07.440]  From policing on American soil
[2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:11.440]  If martial law were enacted here at home
[2:49:11.440 --> 2:49:13.440]  Like depicted in the movie The Siege
[2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:15.440]  Easing public fears and quelling
[2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:17.440]  Descent would be critical
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:19.440]  And that's exactly what the clergy
[2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:21.440]  Response team as it's called
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:23.440]  Helped accomplish in New Orleans
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:25.440]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody
[2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:27.440]  Is let's cooperate and get this thing over with
[2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:29.440]  And then we'll settle the differences
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:31.440]  Once the crisis is over
[2:49:31.440 --> 2:49:33.440]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope
[2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:35.440]  Between the needs of the government
[2:49:35.440 --> 2:49:37.440]  Versus the wishes of the public
[2:49:37.440 --> 2:49:39.440]  In a lot of cases these clergy
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:41.440]  Would already be known in the neighborhoods
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:43.440]  In which they're helping to diffuse that situation
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:45.440]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:47.440]  That they will have in helping calm
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:49.440]  The public down or obey the law
[2:49:49.440 --> 2:49:51.440]  Is the Bible itself
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:53.440]  Specifically, Romans
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:55.440]  Romans 13
[2:49:55.440 --> 2:49:57.440]  Because the government is established by the law
[2:49:57.440 --> 2:49:59.440]  And that's what we believe in the Christian faith
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:01.440]  That's what's stated in the scripture
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:03.440]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount
[2:50:03.440 --> 2:50:05.440]  Of public cooperation may depend on
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:07.440]  That's enough, that's enough
[2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:09.440]  It goes on, look the point is
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:11.440]  We are the people in this government
[2:50:11.440 --> 2:50:13.440]  Romans 13 is out of context there as well
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:15.440]  And they say
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:17.440]  Obey the law, be under martial law
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:19.440]  The government's not obeying the law
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:21.440]  Stealing trillions, caught shipping in narcotics
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:23.440]  It's a bunch of crooks
[2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:25.440]  They're taking over your kids
[2:50:25.440 --> 2:50:27.440]  They're taking over your society
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:29.440]  And they're saying help the government deal
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:31.440]  With its biggest threat, us
[2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:33.440]  This isn't our government, it's a foreign
[2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:35.440]  Corporate takeover
[2:50:35.440 --> 2:50:37.440]  Secret police everywhere
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:39.440]  Secret police teachers and preachers
[2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:41.440]  And Israeli teams
[2:50:41.440 --> 2:50:43.440]  And British teams spying on us
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:45.440]  And who are they spying on
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:47.440]  People that want to stop the banker bailouts
[2:50:47.440 --> 2:50:49.440]  The people that want to have their private
[2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:51.440]  Property rights back, we're the people
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:53.440]  We're allowed to say we want lower taxes
[2:50:53.440 --> 2:50:55.440]  We don't need to have the massage spying on us
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:50:57.440]  Our homeland security for it
[2:50:57.440 --> 2:51:17.440]  Your criminal traders
[2:51:17.440 --> 2:51:29.440]  No, we are not
[2:51:29.440 --> 2:51:31.440]  Investors, bankers, attorneys or real estate agents
[2:51:31.440 --> 2:51:33.440]  We are a group of people just like you
[2:51:33.440 --> 2:51:35.440]  That are sick and tired of the housing crash
[2:51:35.440 --> 2:51:37.440]  And we've helped thousands avoid foreclosure
[2:51:37.440 --> 2:51:39.440]  Since 1993

[2:51:53.440 --> 2:51:55.440]  Or visit www.zerodetguaranteed.com
[2:51:55.440 --> 2:51:57.440]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure
[2:51:57.440 --> 2:51:59.440]  The question is where should
[2:51:59.440 --> 2:52:01.440]  The American people draw
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:03.440]  Their line in the sand
[2:52:03.440 --> 2:52:05.440]  What have we got, a republic
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:07.440]  Or a monarchy?
[2:52:07.440 --> 2:52:09.440]  A republic is based on a
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:11.440]  Constitution which protects minority rights
[2:52:11.440 --> 2:52:13.440]  Not democracy, not mob rule
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:15.440]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[2:52:15.440 --> 2:52:17.440]  So they think they own our land
[2:52:17.440 --> 2:52:19.440]  They think they own our water
[2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:21.440]  Children, our education, our money
[2:52:21.440 --> 2:52:23.440]  We have to define who we are
[2:52:23.440 --> 2:52:25.440]  And what we will tolerate
[2:52:25.440 --> 2:52:27.440]  Somebody is going to ask you
[2:52:27.440 --> 2:52:29.440]  What you did during the Patriot uprising
[2:52:29.440 --> 2:52:31.440]  You have been warned
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:33.440]  We have the facts, we have the Constitution
[2:52:33.440 --> 2:52:35.440]  We have the Bill of Rights, we have common law
[2:52:35.440 --> 2:52:37.440]  Knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen
[2:52:37.440 --> 2:52:39.440]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[2:52:39.440 --> 2:52:41.440]  Don't tread on me, rise the republic
[2:52:41.440 --> 2:52:43.440]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty
[2:52:43.440 --> 2:52:45.440]  And the sleeping giant that is
[2:52:45.440 --> 2:52:47.440]  The American people is rising
[2:52:47.440 --> 2:52:49.440]  A new tool in the Info War

[2:54:07.440 --> 2:54:09.440]  Jonathan Wesley, John will write those names down
[2:54:09.440 --> 2:54:11.440]  If you call in tomorrow and we have open phones
[2:54:11.440 --> 2:54:13.440]  You will go to the head of the line
[2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:15.440]  We have three huge guests
[2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:17.440]  Tomorrow I'm just going to leave it at that
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:19.440]  One surprise guest, start of the broadcast
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:21.440]  I want to hit some news from MPR
[2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:23.440]  That is very revealing
[2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:25.440]  The headlines Revealed and Revealed
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:27.440]  Tarp Expires
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:29.440]  October 3rd
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:31.440]  On the verge of a cataclysmic event
[2:54:31.440 --> 2:54:33.440]  Dealing with Neil Kashkar
[2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:35.440]  Remember the front man
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:37.440]  For the thieving going on
[2:54:37.440 --> 2:54:39.440]  Before I go there
[2:54:39.440 --> 2:54:41.440]  October 14th
[2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:43.440]  I'm going to go live from 11am until
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:45.440]  An hour into the show live the next day
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:47.440]  Then Watson's taking over
[2:54:47.440 --> 2:54:49.440]  I'm going to do 25 hours
[2:54:49.440 --> 2:54:51.440]  We're also going to air, never before seen
[2:54:51.440 --> 2:54:53.440]  All these extra video interviews we have
[2:54:53.440 --> 2:54:55.440]  The ones I'm working on
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  We're just going to air them
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:54:59.440]  Basically unedited, the questions are cut out
[2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:01.440]  With Lord Monkton and Paul Craig Roberts
[2:55:01.440 --> 2:55:03.440]  And countless others
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:05.440]  I think it's eight different interviews
[2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:07.440]  October 14th, some are 30 minutes, some are an hour
[2:55:07.440 --> 2:55:09.440]  But I'll end up doing about 18 hours
[2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:11.440]  A live broadcasting in those 25, 26 hours
[2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:13.440]  We're going to do
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:15.440]  And the money bomb is key
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:17.440]  We don't have the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:55:17.440 --> 2:55:19.440]  Or Al Gore or the Carbon Exchange funding us
[2:55:19.440 --> 2:55:21.440]  Or the UN
[2:55:21.440 --> 2:55:23.440]  And we've already got
[2:55:23.440 --> 2:55:25.440]  Over $42,000
[2:55:25.440 --> 2:55:27.440]  In just with people wanting to give now
[2:55:27.440 --> 2:55:29.440]  To the info wars
[2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:31.440]  Moneybomb.com site
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:33.440]  And whether it's $10 or $500
[2:55:33.440 --> 2:55:35.440]  It's all going into
[2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:37.440]  A special account where 100% of that
[2:55:37.440 --> 2:55:39.440]  Will be used specifically on the studio
[2:55:39.440 --> 2:55:41.440]  And the staff to go to the next level
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:43.440]  Where can you find anything
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:45.440]  More at the tip of the spear
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:47.440]  Boldly savaging the enemy
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:49.440]  People are just in amazement I'm still alive
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:51.440]  Well, it's because if they kill me, it'll make my information
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:53.440]  Even that much more powerful
[2:55:53.440 --> 2:55:55.440]  I don't want that to happen either
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:55:57.440]  But the point is, people are like, could this be for real?
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:55:59.440]  Look at the information, look at what we're doing together
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:01.440]  Look at the platform we've built
[2:56:01.440 --> 2:56:03.440]  Of course, it's having a huge effect
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:05.440]  You're real, listening, you know you can take action
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:07.440]  Spread the word
[2:56:07.440 --> 2:56:09.440]  Start your own radio show, blog, newsletter
[2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:11.440]  Call into talk radio, go to the city council
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:13.440]  Run for school board
[2:56:13.440 --> 2:56:15.440]  Get the globalist out of there
[2:56:15.440 --> 2:56:17.440]  Whatever you do, get involved now
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:19.440]  You can donate it to Moneybomb
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:21.440]  You can donate now if you want, but that big 24-hour period
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:23.440]  We're going to try to raise $500,000
[2:56:23.440 --> 2:56:25.440]  What sounds like a lot, our operating expense now here
[2:56:25.440 --> 2:56:27.440]  Is unbelievable
[2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:29.440]  Millions, it's over $2 million a year
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:31.440]  We've got to raise, and I hate having to spend my time on this
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:33.440]  But it's part of being truly independent
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:35.440]  And so infowarsmoneybomb.com
[2:56:35.440 --> 2:56:37.440]  Links up at infowars.com
[2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:39.440]  And prismplanet.com
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:41.440]  If you want to go on the site and support us
[2:56:41.440 --> 2:56:43.440]  But you can also, if you don't have money, you're not doing well
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:45.440]  I don't want to dime from you
[2:56:45.440 --> 2:56:47.440]  If you have some money set aside
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:49.440]  Or you want to basically tithe to the truth
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:51.440]  To get the word out
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:53.440]  Where can you find a better place
[2:56:53.440 --> 2:56:55.440]  More the front line or the tip of the spear
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:56:57.440]  Than infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:56:59.440]  And the team's working so hard
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:01.440]  For this special 25-hour transmission
[2:57:01.440 --> 2:57:03.440]  That's coming up, but never before seen interviews
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:05.440]  Live interviews, your calls
[2:57:05.440 --> 2:57:07.440]  I'm going to be in here, you know, sleepless
[2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:09.440]  Sleepless in Austin, Texas
[2:57:09.440 --> 2:57:11.440]  For the 25-hour plus Moneybomb
[2:57:11.440 --> 2:57:13.440]  The final story is
[2:57:13.440 --> 2:57:15.440]  Reviled and revered
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:17.440]  Tarp expires, it was an audio interview
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:19.440]  But here's the text of MPR
[2:57:19.440 --> 2:57:21.440]  With Kashkari, Neil Kashkari
[2:57:21.440 --> 2:57:23.440]  The guy that won't say where the money went
[2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:25.440]  He said they would grill him in public
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:27.440]  But then behind the scenes he would quote scratch his head
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:29.440]  When the hearings were over, Kashkari says their attitudes
[2:57:29.440 --> 2:57:31.440]  Switched from critical to congenial
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:33.440]  In a matter of moments, it was all show
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:35.440]  From the Republicans and Democrats
[2:57:35.440 --> 2:57:37.440]  Often afterwards, when the cameras were off
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:39.440]  They would take you into the back room
[2:57:39.440 --> 2:57:41.440]  And tell you that they really appreciated how hard it was
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:43.440]  For you on our team
[2:57:43.440 --> 2:57:45.440]  And how hard we were working
[2:57:45.440 --> 2:57:47.440]  That they supported us in our programs
[2:57:47.440 --> 2:57:49.440]  That's key, they supported the programs
[2:57:49.440 --> 2:57:51.440]  And let us know that if they could be helpful
[2:57:51.440 --> 2:57:53.440]  He says it was 180-degree change
[2:57:53.440 --> 2:57:55.440]  From what they were showing in front of the camera
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:57:57.440]  That obviously surprises me
[2:57:57.440 --> 2:57:59.440]  But evidently, I got used to it
[2:57:59.440 --> 2:58:01.440]  So they're kind of rebuilding
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:03.440]  Kashkari as this hero
[2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:05.440]  But I believe him
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:07.440]  This guy doesn't really lie
[2:58:07.440 --> 2:58:09.440]  He just says I'm not telling you where the trillions went
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:11.440]  And that's the way it is
[2:58:11.440 --> 2:58:13.440]  And of course you have Cassinic saying
[2:58:13.440 --> 2:58:15.440]  I know you're working hard, the question is who you're working for
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:17.440]  I'd like to know from Kashkari
[2:58:17.440 --> 2:58:19.440]  Who, who was too faced with him
[2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:21.440]  But it shows how the leadership
[2:58:21.440 --> 2:58:23.440]  Of these two parties are controlled by the same people
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:25.440]  All I have to say today was a
[2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:27.440]  99 on the broadcast
[2:58:27.440 --> 2:58:29.440]  I'd say 95 on my part
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:31.440]  99 on the crew
[2:58:31.440 --> 2:58:33.440]  We'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m. Central Standard Time
[2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:35.440]  We got a bunch of powerful guests
[2:58:35.440 --> 2:58:37.440]  Coming up right now on the retransmission
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:39.440]  Please spread the word about the broadcast
[2:58:39.440 --> 2:59:08.440]  If you can't financially support
