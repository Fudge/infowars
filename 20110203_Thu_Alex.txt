[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.560]  every broadcast is important this Thursday the third day of February 2011 transmission

[00:36.440 --> 00:41.800]  second most listened to radio talk show host in the world number one overnight show we're
[00:41.800 --> 00:46.120]  talking about a host of issues maybe going to overdrive a little bit with George no me
[00:46.120 --> 00:50.720]  prints who formerly worked high-level as a managing director of Goldman Sachs has been
[00:50.720 --> 00:56.440]  blowing the whistle on the corruption is going to be joining us and Brad Meltzer we've now
[00:56.440 --> 01:01.080]  had a chance to see his secret society history channel piece that I was in and we're gonna
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.280]  have interesting discussion with him as well today but all of the guests are in the last
[01:06.280 --> 01:13.120]  hour and a half of the broadcast in the meantime I absolutely must cover all of this news that's
[01:13.120 --> 01:22.320]  in front of us it is all so incredibly incredibly important now in the interest of covering
[01:22.320 --> 01:27.920]  all the information I've got to get to in the first second and third segments up until
[01:27.920 --> 01:35.360]  33 after I'm going to get into world food prices hit record high UN agency says big
[01:35.360 --> 01:41.160]  sys site stage Portland terror plot to expand domestic spy program airline employee plotted
[01:41.160 --> 01:45.960]  with al Qaeda leader prosecution says it's and we're all lucky who's just the CIA cut
[01:45.960 --> 01:50.720]  out when you're contacted by a locky that's the CIA or a Missile or my six that's been
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.600]  confirmed we're going to get into the situation in Egypt shippers concerned over possible
[01:57.600 --> 02:02.760]  Suez canal disruptions Muslim Brotherhood wants into Egypt Israeli peace deal that's
[02:02.760 --> 02:08.560]  just some of the news in that vital stack that we're gonna be breaking down also some
[02:08.560 --> 02:15.120]  important news Senate repeals part of health care law they swore they never repeal a word
[02:15.120 --> 02:21.440]  of it a dash of it so definitely they know the momentum is against them especially because
[02:21.440 --> 02:25.400]  and now we're learning that Obama's issuing more and more waivers to select corporations
[02:25.400 --> 02:31.800]  who don't have to follow it hence it's discriminatory as the federal judge ruled a few days ago
[02:31.800 --> 02:39.200]  when I come back at 33 after after I cover this other important news I am fit to be tied
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.800]  over this and we're seeing the deindustrialization the United States through NAFTA and GATT through
[02:44.800 --> 02:51.240]  globalism by design via the World Trade Organization and its unfair playing field for free nations
[02:51.240 --> 02:59.120]  against totalitarian systems like China but in the last two years since Obama got into
[02:59.120 --> 03:05.200]  office one of the things that he was really different than Bush on is that he swore to
[03:05.200 --> 03:12.120]  bankrupt coal companies and we have the video clips those are coming up 51% of US power
[03:12.120 --> 03:21.040]  conservatively electrical power comes from coal fired plants and the biggest supplier
[03:21.040 --> 03:25.920]  in the country is the state of Texas that is the plants in Texas supply the surrounding
[03:25.920 --> 03:33.560]  five states and in the past part of northern Mexico now Texas is having to get its power
[03:33.560 --> 03:43.880]  from Mexico that is in the news today and we're going to be breaking all of that down
[03:43.880 --> 03:50.600]  but the big issue here is this is globalization China can build three new coal powered plants
[03:50.600 --> 03:55.920]  a week the US doesn't get three a year and I have the stacks of news where the EPA has
[03:55.920 --> 04:01.920]  been shutting down new plants shutting down old plants not letting new plants be built
[04:01.920 --> 04:07.120]  but then giving waivers to select globalists like General Electric to be the only ones
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.720]  allowed to keep the old plants open or expand existing plants or build new ones so it's
[04:12.720 --> 04:18.440]  not just about shutting down our industry it's about selectively deciding who can operate
[04:18.440 --> 04:24.360]  and we've seen major Dallas and north Texas hospitals without power yesterday and today
[04:24.360 --> 04:28.840]  we've seen one of the tents at the new sports stadium for the Super Bowl collapse we've
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.920]  seen police stations without power but don't worry the Super Bowl has power you've got
[04:32.920 --> 04:39.240]  to keep the distraction going and this illustrates everything we're talking about this post-industrial
[04:39.240 --> 04:45.880]  world if they're able to get this situation rammed through so we're going to be breaking
[04:45.880 --> 04:52.520]  that down and really illustrating what globalism means to this once free republic and other
[04:52.520 --> 04:57.680]  western nations as our power is literally cut off the globalists are seizing every facet
[04:57.680 --> 05:03.600]  of infrastructure hello friends this is Alex Jones you've heard me talk about Calvin five

[06:04.360 --> 06:09.000]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number
[06:09.000 --> 06:13.640]  two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[06:13.640 --> 06:19.240]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[06:19.240 --> 06:24.480]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[06:24.480 --> 06:29.680]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[06:29.680 --> 06:33.880]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[06:33.880 --> 06:38.520]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[06:38.520 --> 06:42.680]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators

[07:38.480 --> 08:06.240]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:06.240 --> 08:20.760]  we are live it is thursday the third day of february 2011 no me prince former insider
[08:20.760 --> 08:25.920]  managing director at goldman sacks will be joining us with vital inside info on how the
[08:25.920 --> 08:30.880]  globalists are destroying our society by design brad melzer will be popping back in about
[08:30.880 --> 08:36.640]  a show decoded and will discuss what he did with his television program that i was in
[08:36.640 --> 08:40.960]  last week dealing with bohemian grove and of course the one the only george norry will
[08:40.960 --> 08:49.240]  be joining us as well today i want to just play this clip this little 13 second clip
[08:49.240 --> 08:55.480]  and if you just type into a search engine obama pledges to bankrupt coal you'll get
[08:55.480 --> 09:00.480]  biden saying it obama saying it repeatedly the big environmental groups saying it repeatedly
[09:00.480 --> 09:05.840]  this is their policy and i'm going to be discussing this coming up at the bottom of the hour in
[09:05.840 --> 09:12.040]  detail a special report this is the deindustrialization and the shutdown of our country china builds
[09:12.040 --> 09:18.160]  three to five different statistics are out there cold powered plants a week we get about
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.480]  two to three a year permitted the federal government is shutting down existing plants
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.720]  and not permitting new plants and trying to restrict the output of the plants and that's
[09:27.720 --> 09:34.080]  why texas is now having rolling blackouts and hospitals are losing their power but that's
[09:34.080 --> 09:38.400]  coming up at the bottom of the hour after getting to the other news but here is obama
[09:38.400 --> 09:44.760]  during the campaign pledging to bankrupt the power plants in this country this is an act
[09:44.760 --> 09:50.400]  of siege an act of economic warfare by the globalists who have their investments in china
[09:50.400 --> 09:56.200]  and india and mexico and other third world countries and if if if the slave wages aren't
[09:56.200 --> 10:01.880]  enough to destroy our industry shutting down our power supply certainly is and then of
[10:01.880 --> 10:05.920]  course the investments of the globalists only go up and obama has given waivers to general
[10:05.920 --> 10:11.720]  electric on power plants but nobody else that's why the globalists want control of everything
[10:11.720 --> 10:15.080]  because then they could set up unfair trade advantages for themselves just like giving
[10:15.080 --> 10:22.040]  500 plus waivers to major fortune 500 companies like mcdonald's on the health care law this
[10:22.040 --> 10:26.200]  is mafia government where you got to go to the government for the favors to be able
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.680]  to operate in its big corporations lobbying for this to shut down their competition here
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.680]  is the trader in chief berry satara so if somebody wants to build a coal power plant
[10:35.680 --> 10:41.000]  they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.560]  sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted well i think that said it pretty clearly
[10:48.560 --> 10:55.040]  but let's play it for folks that may have missed it the 13 second clip one more time
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.320]  so if somebody wants to build a coal power plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt
[10:59.320 --> 11:05.280]  them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's
[11:05.280 --> 11:13.200]  being emitted but china is exempt and has completely dirty plants with no type of scrubbers
[11:13.200 --> 11:17.120]  here in the united states many years ago i bought in the propaganda that coal power
[11:17.120 --> 11:23.320]  plants were dangerous and put out lead mercury and other things and then i did research turns
[11:23.320 --> 11:29.720]  out that under the systems the united states uses nothing comes out of the chimney nothing
[11:29.720 --> 11:37.400]  comes out but water vapor and carbon dioxide because they have water through dozens and
[11:37.400 --> 11:41.920]  dozens of levels depending on what system they have where the smoke goes through it
[11:41.920 --> 11:47.680]  and the smoke runs through the water and all that toxic waste then condenses out now there
[11:47.680 --> 11:53.880]  is a problem they take that waste and put it in your water because that's one of the
[11:53.880 --> 12:01.040]  main derivatives is from the scrubbers is sodium fluoride lead mercury arsenic and a cocktail
[12:01.040 --> 12:04.960]  of other things so the government the federal government's lobbying to put the waste from
[12:04.960 --> 12:10.280]  the coal plants in our water supply but then telling us we got to shut them down because
[12:10.280 --> 12:16.400]  of the carbon dioxide you've really got to love that and they tried to build a power
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.480]  plant out near our family farm in east texas for many years the environmentalist and the
[12:20.480 --> 12:25.080]  epa shut that down a few years ago and there are a few plants in the area supplying dallas
[12:25.080 --> 12:32.080]  and fort worth that are a hundred miles north of our family land and every day i mean i
[12:32.080 --> 12:38.320]  could see the power plant from our farm it's about two three miles away maybe four i don't
[12:38.320 --> 12:42.480]  know you can you can see the stacks off in the distance you'll see sesnes flying past
[12:42.480 --> 12:47.800]  it and back over it and i did some research and sure enough those are federal sesnes that
[12:47.800 --> 12:58.280]  fly repeatedly over them with sensors looking for any toxic off gassing all right i'm already
[12:58.280 --> 13:02.000]  getting into this and i've got some notes here i want to really decode the whole thing
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.040]  break it down put it in very clear english for everybody to understand coming up at
[13:07.040 --> 13:14.200]  the bottom of the hour all right let me just blitz through news now on the situation in
[13:14.200 --> 13:20.040]  egypt obviously you saw the horses the camels riding in supposedly backers of the egyptian
[13:20.040 --> 13:24.480]  dictator hosney mubarak running over people with horses and camels beating people's heads
[13:24.480 --> 13:29.600]  in with clubs beating up reporters some reporters really have been hurt i've watched the video
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.040]  of anderson cooper it's a complete stump a complete stunt looks like they might have
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.320]  slapped him on the head a few times but it certainly is wrong and they are rolling up
[13:38.320 --> 13:45.320]  the different opposition leaders and the media showing you what marshal law looks like continuing
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.360]  a shipper is concerned over possible sues canal disruptions they've got the military
[13:49.360 --> 13:53.800]  guarding the sues canal but there are riots now going into their second week in the area
[13:53.800 --> 13:59.880]  of sues and it's starting to cause some disruptions of a personnel and people going in and out
[13:59.880 --> 14:06.720]  of the dock facilities where the oil and natural gas is loaded on to the super tankers so very
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.880]  serious situation there and obviously you've seen oil prices last two weeks steadily going
[14:10.880 --> 14:19.480]  up here is a report this is in the jerusalem post it's in the ryan novostat out of russia
[14:19.480 --> 14:26.760]  muslim brotherhood wants in to egypt israel peace deal and who did the associated press
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.400]  report last week that our government has been meeting with in the cia the muslim brotherhood
[14:31.400 --> 14:38.880]  and who are they trying to overthrow now the soddies the yemens the jordanians and israel
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.720]  is freaking out about this at least on the surface though the warhawks over there i'm
[14:43.720 --> 14:47.680]  sure will like conflict that will increase their power but on the surface uh... benjamin
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.960]  yahin yahoo the israeli leader saying this is terrible but here you are the globalist
[14:52.960 --> 14:58.680]  and here is the davos crew the george soros crew on record with alberi and the muslim
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.600]  brotherhood trying to put him in all of them at least to destabilize the region so i guess
[15:02.600 --> 15:08.600]  partly now we can have to go has been proven completely right yet again egypt's band of
[15:08.600 --> 15:12.400]  muslim brotherhood movement has unveiled its plans to scrap a peace treaty with israel
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.800]  if it comes to power which the globalist love major destabilization a deputy leader
[15:17.800 --> 15:24.360]  said an interview within hk tv and if israel claims that they're upset about this well
[15:24.360 --> 15:29.960]  why did israel in nineteen seventy three admittedly this is herrits drizzling post you can just
[15:29.960 --> 15:35.960]  uh... u p i's reported on over the years just type in israel founded hamas nineteen seventy
[15:35.960 --> 15:42.560]  three as a quote counterbalance against his bullet so there it is again why do they want
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.040]  that and why has israel been caught israel caught staging fake bombings israel caught
[15:48.040 --> 15:53.920]  creating fake al-qaeda to to bomb them their own people i'm not saying every attack you
[15:53.920 --> 15:58.960]  know is is staged because summer real but the point is israel's been caught doing this
[15:58.960 --> 16:02.640]  because they don't want a peace deal so israel's all claiming they're upset about what the
[16:02.640 --> 16:08.280]  west is doing with the israel that u s england they're all merged at the hip uh... continuing
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.880]  u s response to egypt draws criticism in israel associated press that yahoo and other cabinet
[16:13.880 --> 16:17.680]  officials have been critical of its saying is destabilizing the whole region well why
[16:17.680 --> 16:24.240]  do you create uh... hamas then as a counterbalance against hezbollah and why are you staging bombings
[16:24.240 --> 16:28.640]  against yourself and by the way if you're a new listener and are going whoa i never
[16:28.640 --> 16:34.600]  heard that just search it i mean it's i just told you u p i drizzling post herrits those
[16:34.600 --> 16:40.480]  are just off the top of my head you can pull those up right now continuing uh... pro mubarak
[16:40.480 --> 16:47.880]  writers uh... chase reporters in to caro hotels arresting members of the press uh... over
[16:47.880 --> 16:53.120]  twenty thousand take the streets in yemen for the day of rage again the muslim brotherhood
[16:53.120 --> 16:59.000]  uh... rebellion spreading uh... journalists get attacked arrested in uh... egypt that's
[16:59.000 --> 17:07.560]  a story out of yahoo news again another telltale sign of marshal law it all just continues from
[17:07.560 --> 17:13.760]  there raw story reports protesters run mubarak thugs out of main square uh... so it looks
[17:13.760 --> 17:16.560]  like uh... the government back thugs you can believe that that's what they work for
[17:16.560 --> 17:21.040]  out can't believe me really anything we're saying uh... that they're supposedly being
[17:21.040 --> 17:26.920]  defeated uh... u s uh... angered over egypt hopeful over yemen and jordan there's also
[17:26.920 --> 17:31.720]  some cross talk with the governments openly saying that mubarak should step down at the
[17:31.720 --> 17:35.200]  same time saying they're angered by what's happening over there when they admittedly
[17:35.200 --> 17:40.520]  triggered it two weeks ago oil prices shoot above a hundred and three dollars uh... on
[17:40.520 --> 17:46.400]  egypt crisis this out of the a f p brent crude rally to a twenty eight months high above
[17:46.400 --> 17:50.880]  a hundred and three dollars remember what you were told four months ago by lindsay williams
[17:50.880 --> 17:58.120]  the deathbed uh... intel we got uh... from uh... ken from the former head of operations
[17:58.120 --> 18:02.960]  for atlantic richfield he has another uh... source even more high level is still alive
[18:02.960 --> 18:06.480]  former ceo of a major oil company telling him the same thing four months ago and saying
[18:06.480 --> 18:12.840]  watch the middle east blow up with destabilization as the trigger for that and here it is hundred
[18:12.840 --> 18:20.560]  and three dollars today or crude oil so that is just some of the news that we have on that
[18:20.560 --> 18:27.080]  front will continue to cover new developments as they unfold today continuing with what's
[18:27.080 --> 18:31.920]  happening worldwide with dollar devaluation the world uses the dollar as the world reserve
[18:31.920 --> 18:36.680]  currency that is they may still have their own domestic currencies but they trade uh...
[18:36.680 --> 18:43.040]  internationally for finished goods raw goods commodities oil silver gold uh... in the dollar
[18:43.040 --> 18:49.920]  the dollar is being devalued worldwide and that is the main reason that uh... food prices

[24:16.880 --> 24:22.600]  the other important news and in the next segment i'm going to break down the globalist seizure
[24:22.600 --> 24:30.760]  of our power infrastructure our entire economy our banking system that is coming up and how
[24:30.760 --> 24:36.160]  obama's pledge to shut down and bankrupt the coal industry in this country the power plant
[24:36.160 --> 24:43.520]  industry is now bearing fruit by rolling blackouts nationwide especially here in texas hospitals

[25:06.680 --> 25:12.400]  of the show decoded jam packed transmission for you today continuing here are some good
[25:12.400 --> 25:17.720]  news when this shows the pressure that's being mounted politico reports senate repeals part
[25:17.720 --> 25:23.680]  of health care law the senate voted last night for the first time to repeal a piece of president
[25:23.680 --> 25:29.480]  obama's health care overall president sartoro rolling back a new tax reporting requirement
[25:29.480 --> 25:35.000]  that's been universally uh panned by business owners and the one provision that they've
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.040]  now repealed is the 1099 tax documents on all cumulative purchases from a single vendor
[25:41.040 --> 25:47.040]  so that means a mom and pop you know let's say you sell four or five quilts a year to
[25:47.040 --> 25:52.120]  customers well now you've got to file a 1099 on those specific things you're doing and
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.480]  even more paperwork they have to make close to $50 billion a year is spent in the US just
[25:57.480 --> 26:01.960]  complying with the income tax law alone i know we do here i mean we have accountants
[26:01.960 --> 26:05.600]  and the whole nine yards very expensive and the laws are constantly changing and it's
[26:05.600 --> 26:09.680]  all baloney paid to the private fellow reserve but we choose our battles here because they
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.200]  would definitely clap me in irons in a minute about it and pay this money to the federal
[26:13.200 --> 26:18.600]  reserve but we continue to expose them via the first amendment to remove these criminals
[26:18.600 --> 26:21.680]  it was included in the health care law because they thought it would raise 17 billion in
[26:21.680 --> 26:26.200]  previously uncollected taxes but a bipartisan coalition of business groups have opposed
[26:26.200 --> 26:31.400]  the provision arguing that it would bury them in paperwork and so now the house concurs
[26:31.400 --> 26:35.800]  with the senate move they'll be spending bill as they originate in the house they'll be
[26:35.800 --> 26:40.800]  able to get rid of it so that's certainly certainly some good news we need to repeal
[26:40.800 --> 26:47.960]  the entire unconstitutional monstrosity i'm going to get more into this later but we've
[26:47.960 --> 26:53.640]  talked a lot about this yesterday on where all the lockie fox news associated press
[26:53.640 --> 27:00.440]  reported five months ago the pentagon confirmed was in secret meetings two months after 9 11
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.960]  this was the number three guy in al qaeda at the time number three they're now saying
[27:04.960 --> 27:09.440]  he's the top al qaeda guy under bin laden's i guess number two the number two guy under
[27:09.440 --> 27:16.800]  the imaginary easter bunny or the lucky charms elf but they're now saying that and we're
[27:16.800 --> 27:23.640]  all a lockie who was most wanted at the time for 9 11 but then he's secretly hanging out
[27:23.640 --> 27:27.400]  the pentagon with the secretary of the army in the top brass this is the guy who they
[27:27.400 --> 27:33.400]  form connections with he's the guy that reportedly boy he's busy talks to the underwear bomber
[27:33.400 --> 27:39.440]  and runs that he runs the time square bombing he runs the shoe bomber he runs the ford hood
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.560]  shooter and he's in emails with all of them commanding them in some cases in hundreds
[27:44.560 --> 27:49.640]  of communicates on what to attack and what to do in some cases for years and then magically
[27:49.640 --> 27:52.800]  the state department's ordered to help the underwear bomber get on the plane with the
[27:52.800 --> 27:59.720]  fake bomb that's all confirmed so here is a direct connection to the government staging
[27:59.720 --> 28:04.480]  these events through through a mentally ill or mentally retarded in some cases or low
[28:04.480 --> 28:10.040]  grade moron type individuals they go out and find and recruit now really who these people
[28:10.040 --> 28:15.200]  are talking to is the FBI and the CIA and then they just say and we're all a lockie and
[28:15.200 --> 28:19.160]  then he's a known globalist operative who will take the blame later and who is left
[28:19.160 --> 28:26.720]  alone but here's a bc news airline employee plotted with al qaeda leader prosecutors say
[28:26.720 --> 28:31.120]  and we're all a lockie communicated with encrypted messages with british airways employee and
[28:31.120 --> 28:36.200]  he's everywhere why he's involved in the seven seven bombing six years ago in london he's
[28:36.200 --> 28:49.360]  involved in everything i mean how much more of this garbage are we going to take how much
[28:49.360 --> 28:57.840]  more of this are we going to buy into we know the globalist through a moro lockie are finding
[28:57.840 --> 29:04.120]  patsy's to go basically promote an attack separately you've got the portland situation
[29:04.120 --> 29:08.000]  a few months ago all these other events where the fbi admits even mainstream news says they're
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.160]  staging it they go find normally some person out of prison who isn't even originally a
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.840]  muslim like this martina's character and they go to them and they say cook the bomb here's
[29:19.840 --> 29:25.680]  the bomb here's where you bomb and then they try to let them carry the bombing out with
[29:25.680 --> 29:31.600]  fake bombs and it's just the same thing and then they use this as a way to take our liberties
[29:31.600 --> 29:35.760]  and take our freedoms so there is that report also another report i'm going to get to later
[29:35.760 --> 29:41.000]  wiki leaks us and china and military standoff over space missiles the u.s. government supposedly
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.440]  threatened a militarily attack china over this stay with us it's all coming up we're

[30:02.720 --> 30:07.640]  that the recession is over it ended on june of two thousand nine the millions of americans
[30:07.640 --> 30:12.600]  unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government
[30:12.600 --> 30:16.960]  employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't
[30:16.960 --> 30:21.560]  heard the news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition

[33:11.520 --> 33:22.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:22.320 --> 33:31.840]  siege is the most ancient form of total war if you look at the ancient city states when
[33:31.840 --> 33:39.520]  enemies would invade their regions their favorite tactic would be to have overwhelming force
[33:39.520 --> 33:48.760]  and drive the inhabitants the agrarian farming inhabitants into the fortress citadel and then
[33:48.760 --> 33:55.480]  cut off the stream or river divert the river going into the city state the walled city
[33:55.480 --> 34:00.880]  and wait sometimes months or even years while they starve to death inside and becomes so
[34:00.880 --> 34:07.720]  weak that they give up and open their gates and are then conquered and that's what globalism
[34:07.720 --> 34:15.880]  is that's what the new world order is if you go back 360 years ago roughly the french developed
[34:15.880 --> 34:24.400]  something called mercantilism the french were building an empire at that time in the americas
[34:24.400 --> 34:29.560]  as the french the british the dutch and others were and they found that if they allowed their
[34:29.560 --> 34:36.880]  provinces if they allowed their colonial holdings to develop any finished good industries if
[34:36.880 --> 34:41.440]  they allowed them to weave the cotton into clothing if they allowed them to produce
[34:41.440 --> 34:46.200]  their own firearms if they allowed them to produce their own pickaxes and shovels or
[34:46.200 --> 34:51.160]  their own primitive factories that they would routinely then rebel and try to set up their
[34:51.160 --> 34:56.640]  own sovereign nations but if they could be kept completely dependent on the british on
[34:56.640 --> 35:02.000]  the french on the dutch on the spanish ships coming into their different provinces that
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.600]  they control their different colonial holdings then they could keep the price very low keep
[35:06.600 --> 35:12.040]  them very poor keep prices down and then ship the finished goods back to france back to
[35:12.040 --> 35:18.080]  england back to spain back to other european imperial nations and then sell those finished
[35:18.080 --> 35:26.280]  goods back to the colonial slave holdings this was just a modern more modern version
[35:26.280 --> 35:34.480]  of feudalism we're on average in feudal england feudal france feudal spain portugal if you
[35:34.480 --> 35:38.360]  go study the history and i'm gonna get to the power plants being shut down that's what's
[35:38.360 --> 35:43.560]  happening in modern time it's a form of siege artificial scarcity but it's not if you don't
[35:43.560 --> 35:49.720]  know history you're doomed to repeat it as lord acton said he also said power tends to
[35:49.720 --> 35:55.280]  corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely and so through that mercantile system they
[35:55.280 --> 36:03.480]  were able to keep their competition out in the different nations that they controlled
[36:03.480 --> 36:11.000]  or colonies that they had created also they would have imperial licensure it would be
[36:11.000 --> 36:18.320]  illegal to sale a ship or carry goods or brew beer or make clothing or smelt silver
[36:18.320 --> 36:24.240]  or have a blacksmith shop unless you paid a license but that wasn't enough you had to
[36:24.240 --> 36:29.440]  get approval for the license and that was the attempt to block the renaissance that
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.120]  was starting at the time and everything we've seen in the last 360 years this is all main
[36:34.120 --> 36:39.480]  line history just not taught in schools has been an attempt by the robber baron class
[36:39.480 --> 36:45.360]  the ruling royal class the insider class to shut down their competition and we see modern
[36:45.360 --> 36:50.160]  examples of this the health care law written by the insurance lobby on record forces 30
[36:50.160 --> 36:53.800]  plus million americans to buy their insurance then it allows the insurance companies to
[36:53.800 --> 36:58.000]  set what type of medical care can be given so you pay more money but get less care takes
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.720]  doctors out of the equations and now they hand out hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[37:04.720 --> 37:11.920]  of waivers to massive companies and to obama contributors and unions to where they do not
[37:11.920 --> 37:16.840]  have to get the health insurance but you and your company that's not part of the insider
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.000]  group and can't give millions of dollars in campaign contributions you have to get the
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.280]  insurance and now you can't compete with the mcdonald's across the street with your restaurant
[37:26.280 --> 37:34.440]  you go out of business now that's modern mercantilism but if you go back to feudalism
[37:34.440 --> 37:40.320]  that began to fall in the last 500 years and then mercantilism 140 years later or so was
[37:40.320 --> 37:43.920]  the response to that and mercantilism was just the french term for what the british
[37:43.920 --> 37:49.320]  and others were already deploying but it was codified in economic theorem and taught in
[37:49.320 --> 37:54.040]  the universities as a way to control it was taught as a way for the empire to control
[37:54.040 --> 37:59.760]  this is not debated this is in the text issued to the imperial legates the imperial governors
[37:59.760 --> 38:04.560]  of the time this is a system that's what globalism is is the modern version of that but if you
[38:04.560 --> 38:09.680]  go back to the previous feudal system on average the populations and it's still like this in
[38:09.680 --> 38:14.960]  japan who was feudal and still is to a certain extent in england and france and and and every
[38:14.960 --> 38:21.920]  system creates the same system because it makes sense for ruling classes they want to
[38:21.920 --> 38:27.040]  control you by making you poor by making you dependent but in the old feudal system roughly
[38:27.040 --> 38:34.000]  80 to 90 percent of the land was off limits you had to get a license for what type of
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.880]  crop you could grow you had to give roughly on average 20 percent to the local lord you
[38:39.880 --> 38:43.640]  weren't allowed to have hunting dogs you weren't allowed to take rabbits you weren't
[38:43.640 --> 38:48.120]  allowed to take deer and it was a system and that's what modern environmentalism is to
[38:48.120 --> 38:56.120]  shut down and to have everybody completely on the edge of survival on the edge of starvation
[38:56.120 --> 39:00.920]  malnourished and weak that's why many elites wrote and bragged about how they'd be six
[39:00.920 --> 39:05.880]  foot four and the little people whether it was france japan or england they would be
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.840]  five foot two i mean if a man was five foot five he was seen as a giant if you go back
[39:10.840 --> 39:15.520]  five hundred years ago because for generations they were kept on the edge of starvation in
[39:15.520 --> 39:21.760]  rags sick debilitated not getting enough minerals snot running out of their noses that's how
[39:21.760 --> 39:27.040]  it was described as dirty hovels and if they caught you in the winter as your wife and
[39:27.040 --> 39:32.280]  children were starving if they caught you with a rabbit trap and and and they did almost
[39:32.280 --> 39:36.800]  daily inspections the local thugs that work for the sheriff or the constable and if they
[39:36.800 --> 39:41.480]  caught a stew pot with a rabbit that was one of the most common they would take you out
[39:41.480 --> 39:46.280]  in the public square in the next day tie you up the most favorite way to walk up with a
[39:46.280 --> 39:53.240]  knife and slit your throat in front of everyone or they would hang you high because your children
[39:53.240 --> 39:58.800]  had their ribs sticking out our ancestors their ribs sticking out of them starving to death
[39:58.800 --> 40:07.080]  and if you dare kill a rabbit you are dead dead dead dead and that's what controlling
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.800]  how big our toilets are and our light bulbs and our houses and our cars they build this
[40:11.800 --> 40:16.920]  infrastructure dependent on fossil fuels now they start shutting it off now they start
[40:16.920 --> 40:21.960]  controlling it and they state they want a post industrial neo feudal state that's in
[40:21.960 --> 40:28.320]  the united nations biological diversity assessment 1996 document it's at the end of my film screenshots
[40:28.320 --> 40:37.360]  of the text as I read aloud in 9 11 the road to tyranny 2002 release nine years ago is
[40:37.360 --> 40:44.920]  a complete plan and to understand what's happening with the power plants you've got to understand
[40:44.920 --> 40:50.360]  this and when you understand what's happening in history you understand what's happening
[40:50.360 --> 40:55.080]  currently and they would keep people on 10 to 20 percent of the land they had to give
[40:55.080 --> 40:59.560]  roughly 20 percent of what they produced to the establishment and any of the finished
[40:59.560 --> 41:05.880]  goods or silver smithing or black smithing or gold smithing or any of the supposed higher
[41:05.880 --> 41:12.120]  level small middle class jobs those were tightly controlled and huge taxes and bribes had to
[41:12.120 --> 41:17.640]  be paid the local lords who in turn hired thugs to control you and then the lords would
[41:17.640 --> 41:22.880]  pay it on to the king or to the barony who would then pay it on to the king this is
[41:22.880 --> 41:33.120]  his story this is what the globalists are setting up today but a high-tech version now
[41:33.120 --> 41:36.440]  I'm going to get into what's happening with the power plants down the rolling blackouts
[41:36.440 --> 41:42.640]  all over the country and how this is part of a design right now and how this is neo feudalism
[41:42.640 --> 41:47.680]  and serfdom and a modern mercantile model but first I want to play one of many clips
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.640]  of morocco bomba during the campaign speaking to a newspaper in an interview saying we are
[41:53.640 --> 41:59.360]  going to bankrupt the coal companies the coal plants sure you can build a coal plant but
[41:59.360 --> 42:05.040]  the epa is going to put taxes on you so high you will go bankrupt remember 51 percent of
[42:05.040 --> 42:12.480]  our power is supplied by coal here's that clip so if somebody wants to build a coal
[42:12.480 --> 42:17.960]  power plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be
[42:17.960 --> 42:28.400]  a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted there you have it we're going
[42:28.400 --> 42:34.240]  to bankrupt you because the tax is going to be so high now enter into this that china
[42:34.240 --> 42:41.640]  builds and I see different numbers in the press 3 to 4 to 5 power plants per week huge
[42:41.640 --> 42:47.920]  coal power plants they're building fast rail they're building railways roads everywhere
[42:47.920 --> 42:54.440]  but the united states canada western europe with our criminal governments controlled
[42:54.440 --> 42:58.480]  by the club of rome in the builder group who openly write policy papers at a club of rome
[42:58.480 --> 43:02.560]  calling for a post industrial world we have the head of the goddard space center saying
[43:02.560 --> 43:08.440]  I want a post industrial america we've got to shut off the infrastructure then they lie
[43:08.440 --> 43:12.960]  and say that the coal is dirty well if you go back to 1996 bill clinton took several
[43:12.960 --> 43:20.200]  million acres of land off use for mining for the only clean coal deposits completely
[43:20.200 --> 43:25.320]  clean doesn't have any lead mercury arsenic in it in this hemisphere the second biggest
[43:25.320 --> 43:31.080]  deposit in the world the only deposit of any worth in this hemisphere china has the only
[43:31.080 --> 43:36.080]  other one and it's the biggest instantly and it was in the press at the time when he
[43:36.080 --> 43:41.320]  federally did an executive order and blocked any companies mining that clean burning coal
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.040]  after he put rules in that you have to use clean burning coal which the companies want
[43:46.040 --> 43:49.640]  to use it's much less expensive to use that cold you don't have to spend all the money
[43:49.640 --> 43:56.560]  you know with the scrubbers and the filters that company stock within one week in china
[43:56.560 --> 44:01.040]  doubled and guess who was invested in it henry kissinger george harbert walker bush bill
[44:01.040 --> 44:08.600]  clinton al gore same system again mercantilism by controlling the regulations they shut down
[44:08.600 --> 44:14.160]  coal american companies to get it and get and supply they've got to get the coal under
[44:14.160 --> 44:21.480]  rules so now they've got to buy it from china who has sweetheart deals china's run by the
[44:21.480 --> 44:25.280]  internal communist party it's really just modern feudalism called communism they know
[44:25.280 --> 44:31.800]  how to work with the feudal lords here so it's another deal but it gets worse it gets
[44:31.800 --> 44:41.160]  much much much worse here's an article out of february second out of the examiner the
[44:41.160 --> 44:46.920]  washington examiner illustrating what i've been saying obama issues global warming rules
[44:46.920 --> 44:52.360]  in january that is saying they're going to massively decrease the output of every power
[44:52.360 --> 44:57.840]  plant in the country not owned by g e so we'll have power shortages but don't worry we can
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.640]  buy from all the huge power plants built right across our border anticipating this inside
[45:02.640 --> 45:08.280]  baseball move from mexico and now that's where texas is getting its power during this cold
[45:08.280 --> 45:14.480]  spell is out of mexico the associated press is reporting again sweetheart deals right
[45:14.480 --> 45:20.040]  on the border what did i report in 2008 when rick perry went excuse me 2007 rick perry
[45:20.040 --> 45:25.160]  went to the bill berger at meeting in istanbul turkey what was in the released minutes of
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.760]  speeches when bill berger released some of them they were talking about shutting down
[45:28.760 --> 45:36.880]  power plants in texas that supply five surrounding states number one power producer in the world
[45:36.880 --> 45:46.800]  geographically texas number one meanwhile china has no controls on their dirty coal
[45:46.800 --> 45:49.960]  and the clean coal they're burning it goes up in the atmosphere comes right around the
[45:49.960 --> 45:55.040]  jet stream and guess where it dumps between new mexico and louisiana with texas being
[45:55.040 --> 45:59.040]  the center point of that key jet stream that goes over the industrialized areas of china
[45:59.040 --> 46:03.440]  and dumps right in over texas so we're getting the lead the mercury the arsenic no controls
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.480]  but then going back decades ago they put scrubbers in all of our plants it's a good idea where
[46:08.480 --> 46:15.200]  they go through many many layers of water spraying over the smoke to where nothing comes
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.320]  out but water vapor and carbon dioxide but they know the public is ignorant so they'll
[46:20.320 --> 46:27.600]  point news cameras at a generator at a large factory heating or cooling system when it's
[46:27.600 --> 46:33.100]  cold weather right outside my office there's a factory did 200 yards from here and it looks
[46:33.100 --> 46:37.880]  like smoke's pouring all over the street i heard other people you know from another
[46:37.880 --> 46:43.840]  company going my gosh look at all that smoke is it safe actually doing that last year when
[46:43.840 --> 46:50.520]  it was smoking it's freezing cold there's high humidity and they've got a giant heating
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.400]  and cooling system across the street at the factory and it's water vapor in the cold air
[46:55.400 --> 47:00.800]  just like when you breathe in cold weather and it looks like smoke it's water vapor and
[47:00.800 --> 47:06.040]  carbon dioxide i know you know that but school kids and americans that watch tv they point
[47:06.040 --> 47:13.040]  cameras at smoke stacks those aren't smoke stacks those are the scrubber towers with
[47:13.040 --> 47:18.400]  layer after layer after layer sometimes it's in the dozens depending on what type of cold
[47:18.400 --> 47:24.840]  they're burning it's going up through water spraying on it and all of that is purified
[47:24.840 --> 47:33.400]  out and then stored and then put into our water supply it's called sodium fluoride look
[47:33.400 --> 47:38.160]  it up for yourself so obama's so worried about carbon dioxide water vapor but then he wants
[47:38.160 --> 47:42.560]  you and the government wants you to drink the toxic waste from it oh there is toxic waste
[47:42.560 --> 47:49.280]  from it that could just be stored but no it's put in our water supply and we drink it but
[47:49.280 --> 47:55.800]  but i digress from the heart of the matter obama issues global warming rules in january
[47:55.800 --> 48:04.640]  gives general electric an exemption in february general electric the largest power cold powered
[48:04.640 --> 48:11.960]  builders in the world they're also the biggest builders of dams hydroelectric they have been
[48:11.960 --> 48:19.720]  given a waiver and they have a link to the obama issued waiver because remember obama
[48:19.720 --> 48:24.100]  now congress didn't pass these new carbon taxes they didn't sign on to kiyoto and so
[48:24.100 --> 48:28.200]  texas is the only state to say well we're not going to follow the epa just because you
[48:28.200 --> 48:33.880]  you know you say so you don't have a law congress said no obama says a month and a half ago
[48:33.880 --> 48:38.760]  on seizing texas power plants seizing the regulations of them putting federal inspectors
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.920]  in and saying you will comply with non-existing laws but then it's all selective right over
[48:44.920 --> 48:49.760]  the border the dirty mexican power plants that run just like china they're now going
[48:49.760 --> 48:54.720]  to supply texas but they're insiders they knew about this change coming they get the
[48:54.720 --> 49:02.840]  waivers here in the u.s. and in mexico like general electric is so that's what's happening
[49:02.840 --> 49:11.520]  here and as a response to all of this here are the headlines mammoth storms leaves bitter
[49:11.520 --> 49:19.960]  cold destruction blackouts anger dallas hospitals cbs news and they're asking why does the giant
[49:19.960 --> 49:24.080]  new texas stadium get a waiver why are they getting power well you got to keep everybody
[49:24.080 --> 49:28.360]  distracted with that football game while the hospitals don't have power i mean it usually
[49:28.360 --> 49:31.720]  takes me 20 minutes to get to work took me like 45 yesterday there was no ice on the
[49:31.720 --> 49:36.640]  roads in austin to speak of a few bridges i guess i saw some on the edges but there
[49:36.640 --> 49:45.560]  were no street lights on major roads like 360 no street lights and no police directing
[49:45.560 --> 49:50.840]  traffic they just turned the street lights off but oh there was a waiver for government
[49:50.840 --> 49:57.960]  buildings in the downtown and there's a waiver for the new mega cowboy stadium that that
[49:57.960 --> 50:01.760]  they've built just like there's a waiver for everything else all you're an insider you
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.320]  don't have to get health care for your employees all you're an insider you can have your plant
[50:05.320 --> 50:09.120]  all your china where the global is to build their sweetheart deal factories you don't
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.520]  have to have any cuts but america does what's going to happen to our economy with this what's
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.920]  going to happen in california that went ahead and agreed to the 20% carbon tax on basically
[50:17.920 --> 50:22.960]  all activity in california what's that going to do to the already 30% unemployment that
[50:22.960 --> 50:31.640]  even 60 minutes reports they've got there over 30% 22 nationwide this is globalism
[50:31.640 --> 50:36.560]  and obama is making good on his pledge to shut down industry and to shut down and it's
[50:36.560 --> 50:41.320]  an act of treason it's an act of war he's a globalist stooge it's all insider deals
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.160]  it's discriminatory against other companies they're lying about what's going on and i
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.720]  got the reports here in kansas in south dakota in texas where they're not letting them build
[50:50.720 --> 50:54.960]  new plants have even been permitted i'm going to cover that when we come back china can have
[50:54.960 --> 51:00.640]  three to five a week we can't get two or three new plants a year can you put that together
[51:00.640 --> 51:05.000]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.640]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number
[51:09.640 --> 51:14.280]  two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[51:14.280 --> 51:19.880]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[51:19.880 --> 51:25.120]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[51:25.120 --> 51:30.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[51:30.320 --> 51:34.520]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[51:34.520 --> 51:39.160]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[51:39.160 --> 51:43.320]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators

[57:36.920 --> 57:45.360]  the united states and it's outrageous and it dovetails with something very very important
[57:45.360 --> 57:50.040]  back in two thousand and five we wrote the article paul watson alex jones the myth of

[58:16.760 --> 58:21.960]  so there'd be an artificial bottleneck we're awash in oil natural gas and coal they have
[58:21.960 --> 58:27.000]  to artificially lobby for regulations that shut down their competition and then they
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.320]  claim that a bunch of rag tag hippies did this they had nothing to do with it that's coming
[58:31.320 --> 58:36.080]  up because this takeover this planned economy is for the insiders and it's going to destroy

[59:02.080 --> 59:06.960]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control
[59:06.960 --> 59:12.360]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.360 --> 59:17.720]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.720 --> 59:22.520]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[59:22.520 --> 59:27.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five
[59:27.000 --> 59:31.680]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really

[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.640]  managing director at goldman sacks inside whistleblower joining us a t-minus thirty minutes
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.640]  rad melzer who joined us last week ahead of the premiere of the history channel show
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.600]  that i appeared in secret societies will be joining us again i'll give you my view of
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.320]  what i really think of the episode he put out when he joins us coming up in the next
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.720]  hour we also have george norrie of coast to coast am joining us really looking forward
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:57.440]  to that website of course is coast to coast am dot com i spent the last thirty minutes
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:07.080]  of the last hour getting into this new report that just went up on info wars dot com obama
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:14.080]  agenda to bankrupt power plants triggers blackouts and that's exactly what has happened and that's
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:21.000]  exactly what obama says he wants to do so i'm going to basically go over the other areas
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.920]  of this i haven't gotten to yet recap the facts and call on you the listeners to give
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:31.400]  me ideas or i've got ideas what do we do politically what do we do when we're under siege when
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.520]  our powers being cut off and everything's being moved to mexico and china they've built
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:42.520]  in the last decade a string of power plants along the u.s. Mexico border predominantly
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:48.720]  in texas they know texas supplies five other states who are now buried in snow that's why
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.840]  texas is running out of power as we're supplying the other states which is fine it creates jobs
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.200]  here gives people power elsewhere that the lignite coal they mines right here in texas
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.840]  one reason they have so many plants here and this is all a program to deindustrialize the
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.440]  country and obama has said this that's what's so incredible about how they admit they want
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:14.440]  a post-industrial world now paul watson and i did the research and put this article together
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.120]  today and he's going to be even adding more information as we're moving quick on this
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:26.580]  story as the broadcast unfolds but hospitals police stations all over the state and other
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:31.160]  states but predominantly in texas didn't have power yesterday and part of today and now another
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:37.040]  giant wave of this blizzard that's covered more than 40 percent of the country is pushing
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:43.760]  down across the midwest into the east as we speak hitting much of the northern part
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:49.240]  of the country now coming south hitting where i live in central texas about five p.m. tonight
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.600]  and i've got to worry about even getting to work tomorrow and when we talk about just
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.640]  the corruption of government a decade ago they had a snowstorm and the power went off
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.680]  and the traffic lights went out they'd have cops at key intersections coming to work on
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.680]  major roads that happen to have red lights on them like 360 yesterday it took me 45 minutes
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:15.840]  instead of 20 and there were no police to be seen they're normally there writing tickets
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:20.440]  I normally see about nine to ten police cars or motorcycles writing tickets on my drive
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.960]  to work saw nothing and the lights were almost completely out and there were huge traffic
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:33.800]  jams backed up on them and i was talking one of my it guys he said yesterday driving in
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:48.280]  he saw on William cannon no lights on cars backed up for miles and no police directing
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.800]  traffic because the traffic lights were out but then he saw cops writing tickets with
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.640]  radar guns up William cannon towards the middle school that's there I mean that's what I'm
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:03.640]  talking about this is globalism they cut the power off because they haven't built enough
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:08.160]  power plants so they restricted what they can put out they won't have cops out directing
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.440]  traffic as they're supposed to they got a revenue generating and what have they announced
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:18.520]  all over the country with 60% layoffs 35% 40% you saw the police chief last year in Oakland
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:22.640]  say we're not going to respond to all these dozens of crimes I think was 40 something
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:29.360]  crimes including armed robbery you name it we're going to do revenue generating and one
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.120]  of these other sheriffs people I see announced they go yeah we're laying off 60% of our sheriff's
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:39.080]  deputies will no longer respond to crime we're just going to revenue generate so this is a
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:44.280]  completely predatory out of control government and we're turning into a third world nation
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.400]  that's what third world nations can't run or operate because their government steal
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:53.440]  everything as a tool to make society breakdown so you're so poor you don't have two pennies
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.160]  to rub together to ever become independent and resist them we'll be right back with
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:04.000]  key intel on this straight ahead stay with us hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.600]  in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.600]  off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.640]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:25.880]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:31.520]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent

[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:03.480]  but i'll be getting back into it with mr melzer coming up for about 15 minutes in the next
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.560]  hour today ahead of george noray joining us coming up more on the situation in the middle
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.760]  east of north africa incredible developments now with the muslim brotherhood saying they're
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.200]  going to break the peace treaty when they take over egypt with israel and basically
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:26.080]  move towards war with them the israeli and russian news and egyptian news is all reporting
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:31.280]  that in our own government admits they triggered the riots people have real reasons to be angry
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:35.240]  their food prices have gone up because of globalist imf world bank policies and dollar
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:40.160]  devaluation driving up commodities but this is just amazing as the new world order tries
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:46.600]  to trigger global unrest as a pretext to bring in more tyranny so that is coming up as well
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:53.040]  but i've spent much of the last 30 minutes at the last hour getting into rolling blackouts
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:58.480]  all over the country hospitals police stations without power in dallas fort worth area yesterday
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.120]  and today they're complaining saying why is our power been turned off to conserve energy
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:08.280]  and supply it to five other surrounding states were the biggest energy producer in the country
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:14.200]  here in texas per capita for land space in the world why is this happening why is obama
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.440]  blocking new power plants at least three of them in texas including one they've almost
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.920]  completed in corpus christy at over three billion dollar facility why have they allowed
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.920]  mexico to build all these power plants with us and globalist companies and then now they're
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:33.080]  supplying texas it's all part of a plan to shut down our industries and it's a stated
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:38.200]  plan by the globalist for a post industrial world that's what china is all about that's
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.360]  what the tariffs against our goods are about that's what their low currency is about is
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.800]  making it where we can't compete and then globalist insiders who have sweetheart deals
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.000]  with the communist chinese the mexicans and others they get to set up power plants and
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.280]  things and factories that no one can compete with and then the very same corporate interests
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:01.600]  lobby our government and other western governments to put in law shutting down their competition
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.880]  and again it's just like obama giving out hundreds and hundreds i know it's over five
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:10.200]  hundred waivers and counting to mcdonald's and others to not make them buy health insurance
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:16.240]  for their employees but everybody else has to and don't forget obama put out a order
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.360]  not a law he doesn't have a lot of the doing all this to be shutting down texas power plants
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.360]  and not letting them build new ones and restricting the output of other power plants are putting
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.360]  federal taxes on them that's what the Kyoto protocol does he's just doing it but here's
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:37.080]  the headline obama issues global warming rules in january gives general electric who the
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:43.440]  head of his economic councils the former head of g e on exemption they get an exemption
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:49.200]  from the new regulations not laws because they are of course the biggest builder and
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.200]  operator of these power plants it's about shutting down their competition and i will
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:12:02.880]  bring you back to two thousand and five we saw all this coming and wrote about it their
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:10.840]  complete plan the myth of peak oil paul joseph watson's alex jones october 12 2005 prison
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.920]  planet dot com info wars dot com and we talked about how carbon taxes are meant to selectively
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:22.880]  shut down power plant companies coal companies that aren't insiders how china is building
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.200]  multiple power plants a week at the time now it's upwards of five a week but we're not
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.200]  allowed to have even three new ones a year how then they have cheaper powers they can
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:39.040]  produce cheaper goods on top of their slave wages more regulations get piled on here then
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:44.000]  they lie and say our power plants are dirty when they're amongst the cleanest in the world
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.320]  they put them through these quotes scrubbers that take everything out the carbon dioxide
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.640]  and water that's why obama is saying carbon dioxide is poisonous and wants to tax it this
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:00.440]  is huge this is siege this is deindustrialization this is the post industrial world but in this
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:06.400]  report we wrote we link through to the associated press and raw story who got the documents
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.360]  and they're up on our website group internal memo show oil companies limited refineries
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.000]  to drive up prices donald trump was right earlier this week on newsmax saying we're
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.300]  a wash in oil there's tankers lined up worldwide wanting to offload it there's not enough
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:26.200]  refineries there's not enough infrastructure this has been done by design we know in nineteen
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.680]  ninety five sixteen years ago and in nineteen ninety six fifteen years ago it was all covered
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.240]  by the ap and then we pointed it out in two thousand five they soon got the documents
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.840]  they said we got too much oil we gotta put lobby the environmentalist to shut down smaller
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.840]  companies we've got to go buy up other refineries and shut them off to create a bottle neck
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:51.400]  and the same mega big oil mega big energy is going after all the smaller oil and coal
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:56.240]  companies and smaller power plants the feds came into austin with money a decade ago or
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.280]  nine years ago and bought up the city on power plant that could supply most of the city by
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:05.920]  itself and just shut it off they're shutting them down the old plants they're blocking
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.760]  new plants that have been built bankrupting companies and later g comes in and buys them
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:15.400]  for pennies on the dollar and then they get the waiver to turn them on and so there you
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:21.800]  have it but it's the same thing what do you think's happening with mexico right now they're
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:27.280]  the only ones on the texas region to be able to build all these new plants that don't have
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:35.120]  the regulations on them and then now they are supplying texas that's in the afp and
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.440]  associated press today let me run through some of these headlines mammoth storms leave
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:45.120]  bitter cold destruction blackouts anger dallas hospitals why aren't they getting power why

[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:37.800]  that is can then only be owned by selective insider globalist companies this is mafia
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:45.520]  government this is so criminal it makes my head spin to have this type of garbage going
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:51.800]  and then i have the headline that mexico is now supplying the energy to much of texas
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.720]  because we're supplying it to other states they're shutting down our industry they're
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:01.560]  shutting down everything mexico supplies electricity to winery texas mexico state electricity

[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.880]  say valiantly and say it's time for injunctions it's time to put the state guard in front
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.360]  of these power plants and not let the feds cut down output as they've been doing it's
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:53.280]  time to say no no no and call them and put pressure on them we got forced inoculations
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.800]  suspended in texas and they admitted it was the five thousand phone calls this show generated
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:02.800]  we got the funding for the race war film machete pulled so they didn't get state incentives
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.200]  our listeners did we can get things moving on this and you can get things moving but

[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.200]  article by Paul Joseph Watson, but yes, I'm upset. Yes, I'm angry. I mean, my country
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.240]  that I love is being shut down and they admit they're doing it by design. And when we come
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.120]  back, we'll play that 13-second clip again of Obama saying, hey, you can build a power
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.520]  plant, but we're going to put taxes on it so high that you're going to go bankrupt.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:43.600]  And he's saying you're going to go bankrupt. Your factory, your school, your business,
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:49.320]  your house, you're going to pay more for power. They put in carbon taxes last year in Austin.
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:54.400]  They say 3.4 billion over the next three years. They just said Austin's putting added taxes
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.960]  on your power and gas as part of carbon taxes. Where I live, they're doing this. They're
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.160]  raping us. They're engaging. Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.160]  plans or attorneys? 18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:13.200]  in just 90 days. It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.240]  debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits. When I first joined, I was being sued. So
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:23.320]  I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:27.720]  was dismissed. With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing. There
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.920]  is no other program of its kind. Don't be along when creditors gang up on you. Let our

[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:04.920]  or zerodebtguaranteed.com. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:10.480]  alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.000]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.280]  on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:26.880]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:33.000]  the enemies of our nation, the criminal off-short cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty,
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.760]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.760]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:22:04.160]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.160]  to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.960]  of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.320]  line. Is this a flaw for enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.440]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.440]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.800]  Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:37.120]  bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:12.360]  Vermont. In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart. It felt like
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:18.000]  my heart was pounding, made me feel breathless. I tried many, many different things to try
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.520]  to get some help for myself. Nothing did anything. Heart and body extract is very powerful, very

[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:16.680]  What if I say I will never surrender? Look, they just repealed one of the more draconian
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:22.640]  provisions in the health care bill that, in the aggregate, if you sell $600 worth of products,
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.880]  be it beanie babies or knives, it doesn't matter. On your website or in your business,
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.680]  you've got to file a tax form on it. That has now been voted down on the Senate. We're
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:37.080]  going to repeal the whole thing. And they don't even have a law. They got one court
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:42.120]  saying Obama can run around outside of law and shut down power plants and put taxes on
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.840]  everybody, the power to tax, the power to destroy. We're going to repeal that. But folks need
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:52.240]  to call Congress and say, we know that the shutting down of power plants from Georgia
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.400]  to South Dakota to Texas to Florida, California, you name it, not letting them build existing
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:02.520]  plants, the feds coming in and buying up city-owned plants, and shutting them down like in Austin,
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:07.600]  the Holly Street power plant. We know what you're doing, and that G's being given waivers.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:12.680]  Just like Obama insiders are being given waivers from the health care bill. It's pure discrimination.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.000]  It's mafia government, where only the insiders can operate. Now we've got to get our power
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.600]  from Mexico. They built a three-plus billion dollar power plant in Corpus Christi, and I
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:30.160]  got the Houston Chronicle calling for it to never be allowed to be opened. And they're
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.280]  lying and saying these things are toxic. When all that comes out of them is carbon dioxide
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.560]  and that's why they're trying to say that's toxic so they can shut them down. Well, China
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.800]  has no restrictions on them. That's why we can't compete. And their currency's been
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:49.840]  devalued against ours. Governor Rick Perry and his staff welcome your comments and concerns.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.400]  Calling and telling, we know he went to Bilderberg to discuss Texas Energy shutdown in 2007 and
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.520]  Istanbul, Turkey. I reported it at the time it's in my film Endgame. We can front Perry
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:14.080]  about it. And it's time to call the governor's office. 800-843-5789, 800-843-5789, 800-843-5789.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:19.160]  The globalists admit Texas is the battle line on the Napa Superhighways, on the power grab
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.200]  of the energy systems, of our infrastructure, the mafia grabbing it and saying they control
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.560]  it. That's what this is. You go back 100 years ago to New York in the Italian section or
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.720]  other areas where they had mafia. They come in and say you're not allowed to have a grocery
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:38.440]  store here because my cousin owns the one down the street. And they just burn you down.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:43.560]  Or they'd say let us take it over and we'll let you still operate. Or give us, give us
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:48.920]  a tax. That's all this is. You're not an insider, got to buy health care for your employees.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.480]  You're not an insider, can't have a power plant. I mean, this is so criminal. You are
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:57.920]  a criminal, Obama. The globalists supporting us are criminals. Anyone involved in this
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.920]  in Congress are traitors to this Republic. This is such a big issue. You call Rick Perry,
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.440]  I want to press conference now. I want Rick Perry to get out there and he's done this
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:15.720]  before when you call. And he's told insiders at Fox News, I'll just leave it at that, that
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.620]  he is upset about this show and knows the power of it. He's worried about Alex Jones
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:25.240]  and Ron Paul. We wrote about that last year. He's worried about you. You call Rick Perry,
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.160]  you call the attorney general and you tell him, get out there and talk about how they're
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:37.920]  cutting our power off and making us get it from Mexico and pay more. 800-843-5789, 800-843-5789,
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:47.280]  Rick Perry. You can also fax the governor, 512-463-1849. Citizens assistance telecommunications,
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:59.200]  you can call 512-463-2000, 512-463-1782. That's the main switchboard, 512-463-1782. And here
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:04.480]  is the number to Congress. Here's the number to Congress. You can call Congress and call
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.600]  your Congress person up and tell them, you know what's going on. This is a mafia operation.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:17.520]  If we point out what this is, that word will get out and we can stop them. 202-224-3121,
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:24.640]  202-224-3121. And will this save the world making these calls? No. But resistance is
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:31.040]  victory. 202-224-3121 to call the Congress of the United States. And if you missed those
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.840]  numbers, just search the number for Congress, search the number for Perry, call them. Go
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.480]  down there to the governor's office. Go to the Capitol right now. You know, you're mad
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.160]  about this? Go talk to your Congress. They're about to go into session. Go shake their hand.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.680]  Tell them I want you to do something. You got this tyrant, this globalist insider, this
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.880]  mafia operator with the gaggle of crooks that control him, Barry Sataro, A.K.A. Barack
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:00.720]  Obama. I just read you the headlines where he's giving waivers to insiders on their power
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:06.080]  plants and shutting everybody else down. I mean, is there nothing that these mafia people
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:10.880]  won't get away with? Is there nothing that we won't put up with? And look, get the word
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:17.000]  out about this. Hospitals don't have power in many areas of North Texas. But the stupid
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.680]  sports stadium does because you got to have that distraction continue. There it is, Obama
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:29.440]  issues global warming rules, gives GE an exemption. Obama's blocking of new power plants triggers
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.800]  nationwide blackouts. That's the PrisonPlanet.com headline. The InfoWars.com headline. Obama
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:41.080]  agenda to bankrupt power plants triggers blackouts. Key search term, Obama triggers blackouts.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:45.680]  And I didn't get to that audio clip. We'll play it as we go to our guest coming back
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.840]  where he says, yeah, we're going to bankrupt you. That's financial terrorism.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:30:01.120]  Here on the March, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:05.480]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:10.680]  of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.680]  recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.960]  seemed to be getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.480]  their long expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:27.920]  into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.360]  They both make fabulous investments. Food is our greatest dependency and we know it
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:37.280]  will be more precious than any financial resource. You and your family need food to survive a
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:42.440]  crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals. Alex has been urging you to invest
[01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.840]  in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term. This will freeze the

[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.960]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:09.320]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:13.960]  two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:18.720]  you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:23.360]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:29.000]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:38.000]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.200]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:46.240]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:18.280]  No Me Friends is a journalist and senior fellow at Demos and we're going to be talking to
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:22.600]  the best-selling author here in just a moment. She's an insider Goldman Sachs whistleblower
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:28.360]  and we're honored to have her. But I said I'd play this clip. This is Barack Obama
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:32.440]  during the campaign said at many times, so did the vice president Biden, that they wanted
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:38.040]  to bankrupt power plants in America. Meanwhile, they're not pressuring China who builds a
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:42.760]  whole bunch of them, you know, every month to have any controls on theirs. And now we're
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.640]  having rolling blackouts because of this. And we have the article Obama's blocking
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:54.960]  of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts. And the big issue here is insiders at GE, now
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.680]  heading up as economic council, the former head of GE, they get waivers from all this.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.360]  So it's another unfair trade advantage, just like insiders getting waivers from having
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.840]  to buy health insurance for their employees like McDonald's. I mean, this is mafia government
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:10.640]  where you get the favors from the mafia government. That's why they want to have authoritarian
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:15.920]  control, nothing to do with environmentalism. So here is that clip of Obama saying he wants
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:22.240]  to bankrupt power plants. That is an active war of economic sabotage. But that's what
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.760]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and GE, these guys are all about using government to shut
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:33.760]  down their competition so they can vertically integrate markets. Here's the clip of so if
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.720]  somebody wants to build a coal power plant, they can. It's just that it will bankrupt
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:48.640]  them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:53.800]  being emitted. Now Obama was not drunk there. Our computer
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:59.840]  played it in slow time for some reason, but it's only a 13 second clip. We're going to
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.840]  try to play that clip for folks one more time. But you can just search Obama says he'll
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.960]  bankrupt plants. You'll see many other clips of him online in different speeches. Here
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.920]  it is. So if somebody wants to build a coal power plant, they can. It's just that it will
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:19.840]  bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.360]  gas that's being emitted. Okay, there you go. They're going to bankrupt
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:30.960]  them. Now this dovetails with what Nomi Prince has been talking about. And of course, her
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.360]  latest book is it takes a pillage behind the bonus bailouts and back room deals from
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.400]  Washington to Wall Street. And of course, he's also the author of other people's money,
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.760]  the corporate mugging of America. She wrote that six and a half years ago in October
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.920]  of 2004, a devastating expose into corporate corruption, political collusion and Wall Street
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.200]  deception. That's why the big mega banks and the insiders want big government because
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:57.200]  they can shut down their competition before becoming a journalist. Nomi worked in Wall
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.000]  Street as a managing director at Goldman Sachs and running the International Analytics
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.160]  Group at Bear Stearns in London. Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, Fortune,
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:10.720]  Newsday, Mother Jones, The Daily Beast, Newsweek, Slate.com, The Guardian UK, The Nation, American
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:17.840]  Prospect, Alternate, the list goes on and on. And NomiPrins.com is her website. Links
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:22.480]  to that up on infowars.com. It is great to have you here with us, Nomi.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.840]  Well, it's great to be on the show, Alex. I've been listening to you for a long time
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.520]  and it's really great to be on. Thank you. Well, we're honored to have you. You heard
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.640]  me just getting into the power plants being shut down that aren't insiders with the government.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:40.080]  That pretty much integrates with what you've been talking about, about this rigged planned
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:45.560]  insider crony capitalist system. What's your take before we get into the larger issues
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:50.280]  on these power plants being shut down from Georgia to Texas and now blackouts everywhere?
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.320]  Well, I mean, that's the thing that what, what, what we're talking about, what he was
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.440]  talking about is that if you don't have the money to effectively create your own loophole
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:03.640]  and work it out with the government is as one of the larger power companies like, like
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:09.920]  a GE, then you're going to not be able to operate. And as a result, it consolidates
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:15.360]  the power, you know, actually pun intended, into a handful of a few companies, which is
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:21.520]  pretty much how corporate America works. We are a nation in which the corporations have
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:27.640]  continued to merge, have continued to consolidate power and therefore control and access to
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:34.880]  government and collusion with the government in order to get rid of competition and also
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.480]  control markets and whether those markets are with power or those markets are with with
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:46.160]  finances or those markets are with loans to homeowners. It's all really part of a system
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:53.840]  where companies really not just control but are gaining every day more control over all
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.240]  the things that touch our lives.
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:01.600]  Absolutely. And this is a rigged rigged system. And that's what the globalist admitted. Davos,
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:07.680]  they want is a global system they control where they control the rules for their advantage.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:13.240]  And from my perspective, it's purely a mafia tactic. What would you call this system?
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:21.200]  Well, you talk about the mafia as they're extracting money from various small businesses
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:24.240]  in order to have garbage pick up, you know, in front of their businesses. And then the
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:28.920]  list, of course, goes on and on. But you're effectively extracting income in order to basically
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:35.360]  control a certain set of practices. And the United States government does really the same
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.360]  thing except it goes through the form of lobbyists and campaign contributors. So basically the
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.800]  bigger company is, the more they can pay for lobbyists, the more they can pay for lawyers,
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:48.680]  for accountants, for everyone else to not just create laws but get around laws and find
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.680]  their own loopholes and basically suggest laws that have loopholes in them for them
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:57.960]  to use. And they have the funds to do that. And, you know, we still have a system where
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:04.200]  the Supreme Court is fine with that recently. Confirm the fact that they're fine with campaign
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.680]  contributions coming through corporations. Obviously lobbyists are going in and out of
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:14.200]  Washington in many instances, like with the head of G. Now, they don't even have to, it's
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.560]  not even really an issue. They're just on the advisory board of the Obama administration
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:23.320]  and not just the Obama administration, of course, with any administration. It's just
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:28.880]  the one that's currently operating. And that's really how the money not just gets consolidated
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:36.000]  on the profit of these companies but gets used to infiltrate our laws, create their
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  own loopholes and facilitate their own, yeah, future profits because of that.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.680]  No, I mean, I could talk to you as a former Goldman Sachs Managing Director for 10 hours.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:51.560]  There's so many things to discuss. But on your radar screen right now, I saw you on
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:54.740]  Max Kaiser a few days ago. It's actually going to air tomorrow, but he played an exclusive
[01:39:54.740 --> 01:40:00.040]  clip here of you basically saying, yeah, this is insider trading just with the or borders
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:05.240]  on it with the Facebook Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan deal. There's a lot of different
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:12.760]  deals that are going on right now. But what is most important on your radar screen that
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.880]  you want to warn people about being somebody who's been an insider and really knows how
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.880]  things work?
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.080]  Well, I think you mentioned the Facebook deal. And that's only important because it just
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:30.520]  demonstrates how Goldman Sachs, after having created itself into a bank holding company,
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:37.960]  basically the type of a bank that is supposed to administer deposits for its customers to
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.520]  provide loans for its customers. Those customers not being millionaires, of course, but being
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.640]  regular individuals, which aren't the customers of Goldman Sachs. However, the name of it
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:50.680]  as a bank holding company, which it became in the fall of 2008, enabled it to have federal
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:56.400]  support from the Fed, from the Treasury Department, from the FDIC, and enabled it to carry on
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:02.520]  its trading with our support, with our federal support, which it should not be doing. And
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:07.000]  that's just an example of how a company uses the government when it needs the government
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.840]  in terms of funding it at the brink of a bankruptcy, which it stood at in the fall of 2008.
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:17.520]  And then says, you know, the heck with you guys, we're just going to go offshore, do
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:23.320]  what we want, raise money for our private deals. And if the FCC is going to ask us questions,
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.480]  we're just going to take them offshore and go somewhere where we don't have any questions
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.640]  because those questions are annoying. They get in the way of us, you know, raising fees
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:35.400]  and gaining our profits. And we're just going to go around it. So you have this global system
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.840]  which enables companies like Goldman, like Morgan Stanley, like JP Morgan, like any
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:45.000]  international conglomerate to find a place where the regulations are going to be weakest
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.360]  for that particular deal, that particular day, that particular practice in which they
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.240]  are going to be involved. And that's really a big problem with the system. Right now,
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:01.000]  for example, in Egypt, one of the things that I was looking at, and I'm by no means a Middle
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  Eastern scholar, so I preface this with that, but a lot of the more recent economic problems
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.920]  that Egypt and other countries in the Middle East have had have been due to the fact that
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:19.120]  they have pursued opening their borders to international speculators and international
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:23.720]  capital and international banks buying up portions of their land and portions of their
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:29.240]  financial system. And of course, when international capital comes into a country, it's there
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:34.240]  for a bet. It's there for a short time. It's there to find the best hot deal, and it leaves
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.480]  as soon as it's not making a good return on its staying there. And that's what's happened
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:46.240]  to a large extent in Egypt in particular. Egypt was one of, according to the World Bank
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:51.360]  and the International Financial Corporation, which operates with the World Bank, one of
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:56.960]  the top 10 what they call reformers. Reformers to them are not reforming their country's
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:02.440]  economics for their citizens. They mean reforming their borders to allow speculative capital
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:09.600]  to come in and go out as freely as possible. And it was in their top 10 list for four out
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:15.000]  of the last five years. And the results, of course, when the worldwide depression started
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.200]  is that the money that came in equally left as quickly as not more, so leaving a lot of
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.160]  further economic devastation to the citizens of that country in its wake. And then that's
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:29.800]  besides the corrupt dictatorship and the regime that has been there for 29 years. But this
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:37.800]  is really the more recent effect of this global domination of international capital. They
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:44.480]  like to find itself wherever the borders are most amenable to that.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:50.120]  And Nomi, you talk about the worldwide depression. I've had countless other prestigious economists
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:54.160]  on and they've agreed that we, I mean, even Sticklets two, three years ago, Nobel Prize
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:58.200]  winner admitted we were going into a depression by every yardstick unemployment is 20 plus
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:05.120]  percent here, 30 percent in California. The government lies and says it's 9.6, 9.7. As
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:10.240]  somebody who's been inside of the heart of Goldman Sachs, who's since then written and
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:15.320]  researched this from your research, what's the real state of the world economy and where
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.120]  are we headed?
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.240]  The real state of the world economy is that individuals are finding themselves less able
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.280]  to make a living if they had a living and falling into the poverty levels of their respective
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:33.960]  countries more and more quickly. And that's a direct result of trading and of bank capital
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:39.920]  and hedge funds and private equity funds finding spots and sort of pillaging them to use the
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.160]  term of my book, but really pillaging whole economies for whether it's commodities, whether
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:52.120]  it's to turn a population into shady loans and to package those loans up into toxic assets
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:56.960]  and leave the waste to the Federal Reserve and the rest of the country. Those are things
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:01.600]  that the financial industry in particular, the financial industry is part of every other
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:05.840]  industry. I mean, I focus on banks having been inside of banks, but there's no company,
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.760]  there's no large conglomerate that doesn't work with the large financial institutions
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:20.320]  to find ways around paying taxes, creating long sustaining jobs in the areas into which
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:28.440]  they infiltrate because there's no need for them to do so. And so the state of the world
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:35.680]  is really captive to that type of international financial strategies that continue to get
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:44.960]  worse. And that's why you see in the Middle East that all of those countries have on record
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.080]  somewhere between 10 and 16% unemployment, but just like the United States where we
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:55.680]  have on record, as you said, 9.4% right now on employment, that does not in any way capture
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:46:02.520]  the under-employment, the jobs that are not sufficient to even cover health care or rent
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:07.320]  or rising costs of food and other types of commodities because they just don't stretch
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:12.160]  as far even when people have them. And so, you know, if you look at the under-employment
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:18.440]  statistics, they're in double digits and rising. And that, coupled with the squeezing
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:25.440]  of prices and any type of commodity and any type of financial service or any type of service
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:31.320]  throughout the world, has the effect of squeezing people financially even further. And there's
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:38.000]  no barriers to that. The depression, the worldwide depression that started with, you know, what
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.400]  we call the crisis of 2008 was something that was really building up for many years for
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.400]  individuals, not seeing jobs, seeing prices get too high for that.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.240]  Well, that's right. You predicted it in your 2004 book, and there's a method of this madness.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.600]  These big central banks, who of course the shareholders are private central banks and
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:03.520]  families and shareholders, they are openly dollar-devaluing worldwide, knowing that that
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:08.720]  would cause record food prices that then put pressure on countries like Egypt. And then
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:13.440]  they offer the solution, now admitting that they sent in al-Barati to start the revolt
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:19.280]  two weeks ago. So, back when Sticklets quit in 2002, we got those thousands of pages of
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:25.440]  IMF and World Bank documents that BBC reported on. And right there, they said, once we get
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.880]  a country under our control, then we further bankrupt them, then there's riots, then that
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:35.480]  destroys confidence, then we can come in and buy up things even cheaper. And so they have
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:40.840]  a real stake in the pillaging, putting the populations under their control into a servile
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:47.920]  position so they can come back and pillage them and basically in a mercantile, neo-colonial
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.040]  way conquer them.
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:54.280]  What's the mindset of a Goldman Sachs? What's the mindset of these pillagers? What's their
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.680]  in-game strategy? Because now they're saying they openly want world government, a new global
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:03.440]  cashless currency that all of their currencies are to dominate it in, run by private central
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  bankers.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:10.920]  Well, that's the private central banks are the friends of the international private banks
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:17.880]  because they allow for easy funding to trade. And the motive for everything Goldman Sachs
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:24.640]  does is purely profit. It's not obviously doing God's work. It's not trying to create
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:30.120]  jobs. It's not trying to stick around in regions and actually have a fair economic system,
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:34.800]  meaning fair for the population of those particular regions. It's in to get a good deal and it's
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:41.200]  in to get out, really, as soon as it can possibly do so, as soon as it's churned whatever that
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.200]  good deal is.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:49.080]  I mentioned in a recent piece, I think on my blog, about, for example, in early 2008,
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:55.000]  when things were really getting obviously bad with the subprime lending and toxic gas
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:59.880]  accretion on the back of that here in the United States, that there were UK arms, for
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:06.040]  example, of Goldman Sachs buying up pieces of luxury real estate developers in Egypt.
[01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:12.680]  Sort of trying to squeeze at that particular moment the last drop of what was the end of
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:19.240]  a real estate speculation boom, which will re-boom again, but which now is in its lower
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:20.240]  stages.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:26.360]  And so that's the mentality, mentality is, where can I go? Where can I trade? Where can
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:33.480]  I get investors and see them to trade with me in order to make as much as I can, as fast
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:37.000]  as I can? And they're doing this? And they're doing this outlaw to what happens in the wake
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  of that.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.480]  Where do you see the derivatives bubble going? Because there's no way to get rid of that
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:46.360]  black hole, but they've sold us on this too big to fail, so now they've tied the treasure,
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:50.200]  the pensions of the entire world to their Ponzi scheme.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:56.720]  Well, and not only that, the financial reform bill, and I loosely use the term reform, it's
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.960]  not a reform bill, but the thing that passed in Congress and was signed by President Obama
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:07.520]  in the last summer to supposedly reform the banking system and does absolutely nothing
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:12.440]  remotely of the sort. It's just very, very, very many pages of a lot of legal banter back
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.600]  and forth, all of which can have holes poked in it really, really quickly. I mean, I can
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.760]  poke a hole in almost any line in that reform bill without even having a staff of lawyers.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:27.760]  But one of the things that it was supposed to do, for example, is create a clearing house
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.560]  or place where derivatives would trade out in the open, would be transparent, but all
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:36.320]  the loopholes related to that said, well, yes, we want them to be transparent and trade
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:41.720]  on clearing houses, but we forgot to mention that 96% of the clearing activity of the place
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:47.720]  where these transactions are penned inked or basically transferred are owned by the
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.240]  top five banks of the United States. They're owned by J.P. Morgan. They're owned by Goldman
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:52.240]  Sachs.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.240]  Nomi?
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.840]  Sachs owns one of the largest clearing houses or portion of that in the world.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:58.960]  Nomi, stay there. We're going to come back and continue along that line and ask you the

[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:04.480]  Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:09.160]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:13.320]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds don't perform even
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.520]  gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:22.000]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.760]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.280]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:37.680]  modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:43.360]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:55.000]  a call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:41.480]  Best-selling author. In the latest book, it takes a pillage behind the bonuses, bailouts,
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:46.520]  and backroom deals from Washington to Wall Street. Wall Street has been lobbying four
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:51.880]  domestic police states. They lobby to put dictators in worldwide. They basically want
[01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:56.360]  to secure their ill-gotten gains. They want to make us pay off their derivatives. I was
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:00.400]  talking during the break, I mean, you agree that we're basically by every measurement
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:05.200]  really are in a depression? Yeah, I think we are. And by the measurements
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:11.120]  that matter to individuals, by the measurements that entail getting jobs or keeping jobs that
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:19.040]  enable one to afford life, by being able to afford, whether it's healthcare or food
[01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:28.440]  or oil or whatever it might be, there's such a chasm between the haves and the have-nots.
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:32.720]  And that's not been something that hasn't existed in our world before. It's just that
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:39.160]  more recently, and particularly since the economic crisis spouted in 2008, the fall
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.760]  of 2008, it's gotten worse. And the reason it's gotten worse is because there's this
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:51.960]  external veneer of recovery. There's an external veneer that says, well, the stock market's
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:59.640]  up. Well, the stock market across the world are up. DVPs are increasing. And GDPs, by
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:03.880]  the way, are generally measured, particularly for our country, that's a substantial measure
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:09.280]  and has to do with financial services. So the creation of this sort of on paper wealth
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:14.280]  drives how we consider our recovery and other countries consider their recovery to be.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.400]  But only the mega bankers are making the record bonuses. The only sector that's showing the
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:21.480]  big profits is the banksters because they're the parasite.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:28.360]  They're the parasite. They're those services. They're the purveyor of why markets go up,
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:35.000]  why profits from corporations go up. It's all related to what happens with the banking
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.880]  sector. I mean, it's the kernel of all of this worldwide because they all operate worldwide.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:46.480]  But on the flip side are people's real economy. On the flip side is not being able to make
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.000]  ends meet. On the flip side is wages being worth less than what they were 35 years ago.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.000]  No, ma'am.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.720]  So there haven't been an increase for those people.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.560]  You predicted a lot of what happened six years ago in your first book because you were an
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:02.360]  insider. Where do you see things going? Because it's clear they're not going to change course,
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:06.400]  even if the world's revolting against them. How do you see it ending?
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.280]  I honestly think it's going to get a whole lot worse before it gets better. When I left
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:15.680]  the industry and rolled other people's money in 2004, and credit derivatives were a tiny
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:23.000]  speck on the financial speculation screen and CDOs were tiny, but they were murky and
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:30.200]  they were leverageable and they were dangerous. And things have gotten more complex and dangerous
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:39.880]  since then because there's been no opposition. There have been no regulatory barriers to stop
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:44.040]  the type of financial instruments and financial pillaging that's been going on. It's only
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:47.480]  gotten worse. But now there's a pretense that it's better. There's a pretense there's
[01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:51.200]  financial reform. Stock markets are back up as we just mentioned and so forth. So I don't
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:57.200]  think that gets better. I don't think that changes people's individual economies. I think
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.320]  it's going to get a lot worse therefore before it gets better because after all of what we
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:08.440]  saw in 2008 globally, after banking systems throughout the world, particularly ours, we're
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:13.320]  looking at bankruptcy and we're looking at potential collapse and an ability to fund
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:18.600]  themselves, they all got better. They all got government injections. But the individuals,
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:25.480]  people in the various countries did not. And that will create a more unstable, less equal
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:30.280]  set of economies between the banking economy and the people's economy for the foreseeable
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:34.880]  future. So I just see it unfortunately getting worse. I wish I thought differently.
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:38.080]  Well I tend to agree with you unfortunately. Naomi Prince, stay there. We're gonna do five
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:42.640]  more minutes with the other side.

[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:27.280]  Coming up, we've got Brad Meltzer, decoded popping in and then George Norrie to give
[02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:34.720]  us his take on Egypt, the economy and so much more. Nomi Prince, best-selling author, formerly
[02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:38.480]  managing director at Goldman Sachs, joins us and I want to get her back up in the near
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:43.400]  future just to talk about Goldman Sachs itself. But I look at Goldman Sachs with all of its
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:48.040]  people in government, giving themselves government bailout. I see them knowingly selling the
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:53.520]  Timberwolf, telling investors it was great and then privately laughing at their investors.
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:57.160]  It's a very piratical, you know, world view and then they don't get in trouble because
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.680]  it's their people running the SEC, same with JP Morgan and the handful of the other, you
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:06.880]  know, five big super banks. And I was talking about how they are exempt from all their own
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:13.720]  rules and you said, yeah, look at the IRS. I mean, it's this inequity and this criminality
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:18.160]  that they just never get in trouble because they control the government.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:24.040]  Well, exactly. And all of those companies tend to pay less than taxes because they have
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:28.320]  big counties because they know the loopholes because they are offshore and in a number
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:33.360]  of different reasons. Whereas, you know, we're just talking about the IRS, audits for the
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:39.040]  middle class have tripled. Actually, the New York Times reported this a few years ago,
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:46.160]  they had tripled during this last decade for, you know, sort of regular people. I read an
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:50.720]  article, actually, an alternate recently with an old article from 2009 that just made me
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:55.000]  live it about a single mom with three kids who was told by the IRS that she made too
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:02:00.320]  much money as a hairdresser at Supercut which made $18,000 a year and that therefore she
[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:04.240]  couldn't deduct her children who lived with her because she was able to make ends meet
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:08.360]  on almost nothing. They thought she was hiding something. So, you know, those are the people
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:15.320]  that get targeted, whereas corporations are paying less and less on a proportional basis
[02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:18.120]  of our, of the receipts.
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:24.480]  Google pays 2.4% taxes. Some of these big banks work it out because they write the
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.040]  loopholes and get them passed, pay nothing. I mean, and then meanwhile, I'm paying at
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.840]  the end of the day, you know, they claim it's 35% but it's more like 40. They've got it
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:33.840]  all figured out.
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:36.760]  Right, and it's more than that because if you have expenses, you're going to be treated
[02:02:36.760 --> 02:02:41.000]  differently than a corporation is going to be treated. So, it's really all figured
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.600]  out and therefore, it looks like we're, well, we are in a much worse condition as a country
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:51.480]  because we are disproportionately trying to suck money out of the people that have at
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:56.520]  least and disproportionately allowing those that have it most to keep it. And that's been
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.280]  a problem generally in our economy and that doesn't even count the trillions of dollars
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.680]  of bailouts that a lot of these financial institutions received starting in late 2008,
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:10.120]  without which they might, many might not be in existence today.
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:17.360]  In closing, what do we do from your perspective to start countering this and somehow fix it?
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  What are the solutions?
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:25.960]  Well, I think one thing is, shows like yours is getting information. I think a lot more
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:31.360]  people who feel disenfranchised and in a negative personal economy are looking for
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:35.480]  alternative information sources, you know, to know they're not alone and they're not
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:41.360]  crazy and there's nothing wrong with them. There's actually real policies that are affecting
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.080]  them and I think that's the start is that kind of information sharing and that kind
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:51.880]  of knowledge. And then it's really organizing and getting together and, you know, trying
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:56.720]  to at least make our voices heard. I mean, there's something to be said for what's going
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:02.600]  on in the square in Egypt right now. And again, there are many reasons for that revolution
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:08.840]  taking place then, but many of them stem from being screwed by the international capital
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:15.040]  class and wanting very simple dignity and simple jobs and the ability to make a living
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:20.840]  and clearly the international capital class is not really free market. It's crony market
[02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:25.320]  where they rig the system for themselves like a rig casino. It's got to end. The problem
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:29.040]  is they're going to sell us collectivism is the answer because then they can collect
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:34.280]  more of our wealth and steal it through government and give it to themselves. Very complex issue.
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:37.960]  No me prints of no me prints.com. We look forward to having you back on to really get
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:43.160]  into Goldman Sachs itself in the next month or so. Thank you so much for spending time
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.800]  with us and I'm honored that you're a listener. Thank you, Alex. Take care. There goes no
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:53.160]  me prints. Amazing Goldman Sachs insider will have her back very soon to get into inside
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:57.160]  Goldman Sachs. We'll be right back. Brett Meltzer is coming up. Then George Norrie and
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:04.000]  a lot more stay with us. Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.800]  is over. It ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:14.280]  agree. Perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:18.680]  of us things seem to be getting worse. Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:22.720]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon. In addition to converting your
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:26.960]  shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:32.360]  eFoods Direct. They both make fabulous investments. Food is our greatest dependency and we know
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.920]  it will be more precious than any financial resource. You and your family need food to
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:41.920]  survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals. Alex has been urging you
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.880]  to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term. This will freeze
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:51.960]  the cost to your food while you can still afford it. Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet

[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:34.720]  We're looking for a factory where a man can feed his family. I'm looking for America.
[02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:59.080]  Go to Gusset.com forward slash America. Again, go to Gusset.com forward slash America
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:25.040]  today.
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:51.000]  Go to Gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:06.960]  Go to Gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  All right. We're scheduled to have Brad Belcher joining us here in about seven, eight minutes.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.120]  We've only got him for 15, so we're going to skip the next network break coming up for
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:42.400]  stations that are out there. This is very important, obviously, what we've been talking
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.400]  about with the economy because it affects us all. I want to get back into that and then
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:55.920]  some of the latest developments in Egypt as well. Before I go any further, we've posted
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:02.000]  a new article at infowars.com and prismplanet.com. There's also a trailer for the hour-long special
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:07.440]  with the father of weaponized weather, Ben Livingston, because it's normal to have different
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:12.160]  cycles and mega-blizzards and hot temperatures and then cold temperatures. The only thing
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:19.040]  that's constant is change in weather and the climate. Al Gore came out yesterday and said
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:23.520]  this is global warming to have snow. Of course, a few years ago, we played the clips, he said
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:27.680]  we would have snowless winters because of global warming. He is a quack, he is a fraud,
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:33.960]  and he knows it. He's bought into the big carbon trading company with Bill Clinton
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:39.960]  and George Soros and others. It's important, though, to understand that the federal government
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:44.320]  admits they have weather weapons programs, weather manipulation programs. The former
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:52.080]  Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, of course, has admitted all of this as well. We need
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:56.320]  to understand that this could all be natural what's happening, but the fact that it's
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:00.080]  all classified, or most of it's classified, what's going on with weather weapons and
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:06.280]  geoengineering and weather manipulation, that we need to demand all of this be classified.
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:11.440]  The video and the article is up on infowars.com and prismpana.com, the father of weaponized
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.560]  weather. Veteran weather modification expert Ben Livingston is a former Navy physicist
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:20.080]  who briefed President Lyndon Baines Johnson the effectiveness of weather control back
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:25.400]  in the 60s, and, of course, he launched attacks on the North Vietnamese using it. He was the
[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:29.400]  first guy to fly into typhoons and hurricanes with an aircraft in World War II and after
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:33.240]  World War II. He's an amazing individual, and when it was declassified five years ago,
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:36.360]  we were able to start talking about it, and most of this interview has never before been
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:41.280]  seen. We released one a few years ago, but this is the full thing with the latest information,
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:47.600]  and it's available at prismplanet.tv. We are adding more and more exclusive original
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:53.680]  videos. All of my films expanded extra as the live video stream of the radio show. That's
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:58.000]  also archived each day. My book, Paul Watson's book, countless other films we've been authorized
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  to post like Camp FEMA and many other documentaries. Prismplanet.tv is an armory of resistance,
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:11.680]  and we always run the special in December and January. We've never run it into February,
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:18.080]  where you can get five months free at prismplanet.tv, but you can right now, and I've told them
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:21.760]  to pull down the special in the next two days to go ahead and get around to it, but I wanted
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:27.120]  to have this Ben Livingston video go out first during the special, and so we're a little
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:34.040]  bit late pulling the special, but it's now available at prismplanet.tv. And it is your
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:42.440]  support of the broadcast. It is your support of the radio show, of our local AM&FM sponsors,
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:48.560]  of our national sponsors. It's you spreading the word that allows us to continue and grow,
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:52.960]  and the information obviously we're covering is so vital to the future of this republic.
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:58.800]  So please don't forget to support our sponsors and to also become a prismplanet.tv member.
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:02.400]  We allow you with the same username and passcode to have six people logged on at one time
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:06.440]  with the same code. So you can also give yourself the gift of information and support us, but
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:09.800]  also share it with a few friends and family. I'd love to just give it out all for free,
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.640]  but then we couldn't finance ourselves. We also have the online video, bookstore slash
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.560]  t-shirt, ball caps, infowars.com, draft Ron Paul, V for victory, a lot of new t-shirts
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:25.800]  up there as well at infowars.com. And we couldn't do any of this again without your support,
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.960]  but great books, powerful films. You may know all about this stuff. You may know more than
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:34.200]  I do, but your neighbors, your friends, your family will watch professionally produced
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:39.480]  films. They will read well written, dynamic, informative, intriguing books, and they're
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:47.760]  all available at infowars.com as I was saying earlier. Again, Brad Meltzer should be on
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:51.640]  the next five minutes or so. Then George Norrie, who needs no introduction, will be joining
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:55.000]  us in the last half hour. I may twist his arm and go into overdrive, but I know the
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.880]  guy's got to probably go to sleep before he does his radio show. Again, tonight, the second
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:08.120]  largest radio show in the world. So that is coming up as well today. Obviously, I spent
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:14.400]  much of the first hour getting into this article because it's so incredibly important. Obama's
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:20.360]  blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts. We're doing the key Google search
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:26.880]  term today. Obama triggers blackouts. And you can read the article at infowars.com and
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:32.920]  prisonplanet.com. Obama's blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:39.080]  Fury as hospitals hit with outages while post industrial collapse of America accelerates
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:46.300]  by design. And then insiders like GE gets waivers from all of this while they shut down power
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:53.280]  plants in Georgia, Kansas, South Dakota and Texas, shutting down old plants, shutting
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:14:00.760]  down new plants or restricting the power output of plants while police stations, traffic
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:06.200]  lights, hospitals don't have power. I mean, this is incredible. And while the globalist,
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:10.320]  the insiders that run our country are the biggest holders of our debt through their
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:17.080]  pawn China. This is high treason. I call treason and I'm sick of it. And I want to get this
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:21.360]  report out to everybody. This article needs to be seen so people know why they're having
[02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:28.040]  blackouts all over the country. So they know why all of this is going on. This is important
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:35.880]  information. It just shows how brazen and naked the criminality has gotten in our society.
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:41.960]  I just had the former managing director of Goldman Sachs on agreeing and concurring
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:49.040]  with this insider takeover of the power plants and our society. It is so criminal and somebody
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:54.880]  has got to stand up and basically call it what it is treason, a sellout where the select
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:15:02.560]  companies get unfair trade advantages against our entire society by doing this. And they're
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:06.400]  doing it on the health care where if you're an Obama insider, you don't have to get the
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:10.880]  health care and unfair trade advantage. They're doing it on NAFTA and GATT deals with select
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:15.240]  corporations to do whatever they want, small mom and pops or even larger independent groups
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:22.760]  can't. This is the system of control that we've been discussing. Now I am excited to
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:26.880]  be joined by Brad Meltzer. He's the number one New York Times bestselling author of the
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:33.640]  book of fate, as well as the other bestsellers, the 10th justice dead, even the first counsel,
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:39.160]  the millionaires, the zero game, the book of lies. His latest book is of course the
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:45.760]  inner circle and he is the producer or the creator of decoded the last episode of the
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:51.880]  latest season coming up this 39 10 o'clock Eastern. We had Brad on last week and he said,
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:55.760]  look, trust me, you're going to like the episode. And yeah, they made me, I think, look pretty
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:16:01.160]  good. But that isn't the end all be all in this. The real question is, did they present
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.320]  the Grove? And of course, it's all from perspectives in a way that I think was accurate. I think
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:09.360]  they showed both sides, but lean towards the grovers. But what do you expect to get it
[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:15.120]  on national TV? Brad, you haven't seen the final cut yet. Were you happy with what aired
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:16.120]  last Thursday?
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:20.320]  You know, I think you described it actually, you know, near perfectly. Like I think we
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:25.000]  show both sides. But the one thing I disagree is I don't think we lean toward the grovers.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.080]  I think that the if you look at what's online, I think two things came through. I think one,
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:33.040]  you came through like a hero, right? I mean, the last line about you was, you know, let's
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:37.000]  get Alex out of here. It was like protective, very protective of you. And I'll wage a good
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.680]  money in, you know, in your experience. That's rare for you, right? I mean, I feel like we
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:45.240]  took real good care for you. And I was proud of that that we take care of the people who
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:48.840]  know the only other national TV program to ever be fair and not try to make me look like
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:53.680]  a kook is conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura. So, so no, I mean, you did keep your, you
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.920]  know, word on that. I mean, you said, we'll be fair. And I think it was fair overall with
[02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:01.560]  myself. It's just that, you know, the host of the show, but they've got their own views
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:06.280]  saying, oh, it's so wonderful. We wish we could be involved. And when you said, you
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:10.160]  know, I briefly described the ritual, you said, and that's it. That's all, that's all
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:13.840]  that happens there. And obviously you can't put everything in a short program, but there
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:19.120]  was a lot more there. And you did every every, but to be fair, like, and you saw this, right?
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.680]  Is, we talked about this last week is they said legally, we couldn't run the footage.
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:27.480]  If we were really being controlled by anyone who said, no, we went to try to, I mean, we
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.160]  literally recreated that footage and had a whole art department. We pushed the show back
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:35.880]  two weeks to make sure that we could show the best version of that footage. Legally,
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:36.880]  anyone would allow.
[02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:38.880]  No, I mean, it was a beautifully done, well produced.
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:42.280]  Yeah, we went all out to say like, listen, man, this guy found this stuff. Let's look
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:45.760]  at it. I mean, this is, this is a real deal. And I think, you know, I think you made it,
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:50.120]  I actually think the interesting part of the episode was watching Buddy Mack and Scott,
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:54.280]  who are amazingly wonderful people. You spend time with them. You know that yourself. But
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:57.960]  I think they got really freaked out after being arrested. I really do. And I think,
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:01.120]  you know, at the end of the show, when they said, you know, yeah, the grove is this or
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.240]  that. I mean, listen, I had the last word on the show and you saw how I closed it. And
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:08.680]  I closed it saying like, you know what, I don't like when in America, some people have
[02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:12.520]  more say than others. And I think that was a real, you know, that was something to be
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:16.200]  listened to at that moment. Not saying, Hey, everybody, let's, you know, this is all peace
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:17.200]  and love and happiness.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:21.240]  Brad, obviously I have mixed feelings about the piece. And so I'm just giving people my
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:27.920]  honest view of it. Surely all the experts you talked to, and of course you just went
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:31.320]  and talked to real people, they all said at the end of the day, we have a problem with
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:36.560]  the secrecy and policy being decided there. So you had all four of the people, the experts
[02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:40.680]  you interviewed, myself and three others concurred from Mary Moore to the professor
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:46.840]  to everybody else. And so that point did get brought across honestly. And then your host
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:49.960]  kind of said, Oh, we don't think there's a problem, but then you came back and said,
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:54.240]  No, I think there is. So overall, I think it was, was balanced. And what do people from
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:59.000]  our perspective, you know, my listeners expect to see, frankly, it was better than I thought
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:04.040]  it was going to be, Brad. So overall, I don't think you've been deceptive on that front.
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:06.040]  And I appreciate you involving me in the show.
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.680]  And listen, here's the thing is, I can only, and you know this better than anybody, you
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:14.280]  can only represent yourself by your actions, not your words. And what we spoke about last
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.280]  week, I was like, Alex, listen, I haven't seen the final cup, but I saw the cup right
[02:19:17.280 --> 02:19:20.840]  before it. And I think it's, I think you're going to go, this is more fair than anything
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:24.240]  you've seen out there when you go on, especially with you, because you know, everyone, you
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:25.960]  know, was always out to make you look like a nut.
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.960]  No, the trio network.
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:33.080]  And I was like, listen, you can only, I will only ever ask anyone to judge decoded and people
[02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:36.600]  have their own views of history channel, and people have their own views of what you do,
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:40.480]  what I do, what all of us do, but you can only judge decoded by watching. And I think
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:44.920]  when you look at the response the next day, I think the major call from Americans around
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:49.440]  the country on our Facebook page, on our Twitter account, everywhere that I had stuff was like,
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:53.160]  man, you really tried to blow the lid off of something here. And it wasn't like, you
[02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:57.120]  know, you were trying to protect them. You know what? I appreciate that people saw for
[02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:00.400]  what it was. They didn't, you know, we didn't, we didn't, the thing that I thought was actually
[02:20:00.400 --> 02:20:03.880]  important and interesting is like, well, we really tried to, and I think we do it on every
[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:09.240]  episode is what you said, try to be fair, show both sides, let people look and let's
[02:20:09.240 --> 02:20:11.880]  make a sensible decision. And I think that we did.
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:17.920]  Let me say this, the trio network aired the footage I shot nine years ago, but obviously
[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:21.760]  it probably has one one hundredth at the time, the viewership that history channel and a
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:25.960]  premier program like yours does, and they did basically try to make me look like a lunatic
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:33.160]  cook. So compared to that, compared to what they did, yes, I would say it's an A plus,
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:38.040]  but compared to what my radio show or the internet, you know, can do, having more time
[02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:42.560]  to really get into it, you know, I'd give it a B, but, but, but for getting it on national
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:46.800]  television, I think it says something about how much cultures change. They would have
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:51.080]  never allowed this on 10 years ago. I think the internet has pushed the boundaries of
[02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:55.440]  what can be shown and gotten into with how many media executives do go to the Grove.
[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:58.880]  I am surprised it even aired. I'll be honest with you, you know, I think you're right
[02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:03.520]  about this. I think also a very important thing you said is, um, it's just a different
[02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:07.960]  world than nine years ago, right? And, and we, when we started this show, this is fascinating
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:11.600]  to me. You know, one of the producers said to me, Brad, on shows like this, you know,
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:14.960]  I talk about every network, not talking about history by any stretch, you know, but like
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:18.960]  on shows like this, we have people trying to get to the truth. Here's how it works.
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:24.480]  He says, when you have less facts, you play more scary music. And I was like, man, no
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:28.680]  true words ever been spoken, but I never want to be that show. I never want to be the show
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:33.360]  that needs to rely on scary music for the thrills. To me, the most thrilling, scary
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:37.560]  story of all is the true story. So, you know, we were like, let's go show it. Let's show
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:41.720]  what it is. If someone's got footage of it, let's air it. If we can't air it, let's reproduce
[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:46.360]  it in, in, you know, a form that you can air. And I think, you know, what I think America
[02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:50.200]  has done in the code and when they're watching it went and wait, you see tonight's episode
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:53.080]  tonight's episode is on the Georgia guide stones. I don't know if you know the Georgia
[02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:57.720]  guide stones, but it's like the United States. They're amazing. They're crazy. I think I
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:22:01.600]  said to Mar and I thinking it's Wednesday. I guess tonight is Thursday, so it's tonight.
[02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:05.960]  10pm, 9th century. You'll see our Georgia, you know, the, we do American Stonehenge
[02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:09.320]  and I'll blow your mind. We go and, well, you know, you know, it's Ted Turner. I mean,
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.720]  you know, Ted Turner, we mentioned Ted Turner on the episode. We don't shy away from it.
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:18.280]  I mean, it's Ted Turner that gave the money to the RC Christian. You know what? I don't
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:22.920]  think what I say tonight on the episode is, I think the Ted Turner theory is preposterous
[02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:27.320]  because Ted Turner is a guy and when you look at what his stuff is, he never shies away
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:30.960]  from taking credit. However, what we do at the end of the episode and you'll see there
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:35.720]  is we try to identify who RC Christian is and, you know, the idea that he's, listen,
[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:40.280]  this is a guy who's probably still alive. There's lots of theories of who he is and
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:44.520]  who put up this American Stonehenge. And I got to stop you because we're almost out
[02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:49.640]  of time. I only got eight minutes left here, Brad, but RC Christian is an anagram for Rosa
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:54.120]  Crucians. It's got the keep us at 500 million number. Yes, we've been there. Yes, we've
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:57.640]  covered it. Now, let me get into the tough issues with you. And obviously I'll be watching
[02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:01.240]  tonight with your show because I have to find it intriguing. We appreciate you giving us
[02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:04.680]  time and hopefully you'll come back on for 30 minutes or an hour in the future when the
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:07.960]  series is done, when you're not so busy and they're doing a bunch of interviews right
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:14.040]  now. But, but here's what I have problems with. You know, buddy and them say, well,
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:17.840]  you know, they're supposedly set up as world government, but we're still here. No, we're
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:22.160]  going into a global government. They're announcing the global government run by the private banks.
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:27.360]  You go on and say, everybody always blames skull and bones for everything, but it hadn't
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:32.800]  been proven. Alfonso Taft set up skull and bones with Williamson Hodgin and Russell.
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:38.600]  It's admitted in mainline research that they did. Russell went to Germany and did join
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:43.520]  the Illuminati. There's a plaque inside the skull and bones reportedly when others broke
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:49.360]  into it in the 1880s saying from the Illuminati to our U.S. chapter, I saw all sorts of skull
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:54.800]  and bones, pirate quotes, skulls, statements. I own three of the annals of the Bohemian
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:24:00.680]  Grove, which, which actually talk about connections. I have helmet Schmitz book, the German Chancellor
[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:05.600]  talking about the connections to the Bavarian Illuminati. And, and, and, and so to say,
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:09.560]  you know, Alex is saying there's a skull and bones connection. There's no doubt that you
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:15.080]  got Taft and others going there. And that's when the big wigs show up and it is a skull
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:16.080]  and bones type outfit.
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:20.520]  Yeah, you know, I, and, and, and let me say this is we, you know, I, I went to search
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:23.560]  and I made sure that the, you know, the people who were, when we were doing that show, I
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:27.160]  was like, listen, Alex just said skull and bone. If this is the great skull and bones
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:30.880]  one, find it, man. Let's go. Let's look and find out what they're doing now. And I can't
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:35.120]  listen. I can't argue. Listen, you know this stuff backwards, you know, you, you know what
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:38.920]  you have and I can't see it right now as I talk to you. But what I will say is, you
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:44.160]  know, my opinion of skull and bones is in 1992, when I was in college, my buddy, Matt
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:48.920]  Oshinsky, who was, you know, it was a Yale undergraduate and I used to go up and visit.
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:52.240]  I wanted to get in the skull and bones in 1992. And I was like, take me in there. And
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.400]  he was basically like, these guys are yutters, you know, and he was, he was in his own secret
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:00.880]  society, but he was like, man, skull and bones isn't what it used to be. It used to be something
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:06.480]  awesome. Right. He used to have the power elite. And it's just not the way it was they
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:10.680]  and I can only say, look, I don't have their own personal experience. My personal experience
[02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.560]  was my buddy was there who I trust when it was a stand up guy, stand up American and was
[02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:19.360]  like, these guys aren't what they used to be. And it's like any other, let me tell you
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:23.400]  something today, but it's just not what it used to be. And to me, like you find a man,
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:29.240]  I'll air it. I would love to do skull and bones, Brad. I'll send you to Charlotte, uh,
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:34.320]  is or be whose father and grandfather were skull and bones. And she's got the grandfather
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:38.520]  clocks. She's the one that gave Anthony Sutton all the secret documents. We've now copied
[02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:42.320]  them all. We're doing a big report on it. And let me tell you something. She says it's
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:47.680]  black magic occult. There is a cult going on there. Uh, her dad was a guest of Bohemian
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:52.360]  Grove and it's definitely connected and they definitely get naked and are born again in
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:57.920]  coffins and the whole nine yards. And I'm here to tell you, skull and bones is the Illuminati.
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:03.080]  It is very dark and it is pushing a global tyrannical world government. I mean, here's
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:06.200]  another issue I've got. And I, if you want to tell me, let me also say this before you
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:12.440]  finish that thought is extended to me because you, I, again, as a man of my, of not just
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:16.680]  word, but my actions, you can judge him if you have the information. I'd love to put
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:20.080]  that on the air and show the truth. Like he presented to me because I'd love to do, if
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:23.600]  we get another season, I'd love to do skull and bones, man. I'd love to find out what
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:28.920]  the real story is there. That is what I'm dying to know. And if I'm, I don't ever proclaim
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:32.200]  that I know it all, I'm willing to look at anything that I didn't want to tell when it
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:33.880]  comes to proof. So please send it to me, pal.
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:36.720]  Well, I'm not trying to keep slapping you around. I'm assuming an honest interview.
[02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:39.440]  Man, you gave us an A plus. I can't ask for more than that.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:42.160]  Well, I mean, an A plus compared to anything else has ever been on television.
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:44.880]  Yeah, that's okay. I'll take it. I'll take a grout, take a curve.
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.440]  But I mean, I think that's about as much as you could get on TV. But I mean, even, even
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:53.480]  even showing the other side and being fair. But here's another big issue. You said, okay,
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:57.360]  that's the ritual. The most important thing I may say on this broadcast, this program,
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:01.680]  is that outsiders shouldn't try to interpret this. I went to professors. I researched the
[02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:08.040]  occult and those old men watching that ritual were taking it as a ritual. They were getting
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:13.000]  off on it. They were grinding their teeth. There's a bunch of other rituals. I did tell
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.440]  your crew and it's even at Vanity Fair and the New York Post about the gay porn stars
[02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:23.880]  being brought in, the sex, the homosexuality. That did not make it in the show. And so it
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:29.120]  is an occult ritual. They do take it serious. And as an outsider, I'm able to research
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:34.320]  the occult and know what's happening. I think that prejudiced everything I said in the program
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.320]  when you said that.
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:38.680]  It's interesting because I actually took it a different way. I actually took it as,
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:42.120]  you know, again, don't, you know, it's like when we went into freemasonry and we went
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:46.800]  looking at freemasonry, I think a lot of stuff in freemasonry gets taken literally that's
[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:50.480]  meant figuratively. And I'm not defending it. I'm not protecting that. I'm not saying
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:52.040]  either way. You know, people have their opinions.
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:56.240]  Well, the porch masons aren't bad people and many of our founders were masons and they
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:57.240]  spoke out against the Illuminati.
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:01.400]  So my point is simply, my point is simply that when, and it wasn't meant to slap anyone
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:05.360]  either way, when I said that statement, it was, and I stand behind, that to me is still
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:08.680]  the best thing that I said on that whole episode, except for maybe the closing remarks of the
[02:28:08.680 --> 02:28:14.560]  episode. And it was when you try to analyze something, when you truly try to decode something,
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:17.560]  you have to understand the context. And I think even you'd agree with that, right?
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:22.320]  You've got to know the context of what it is. And if the context is really occult and
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:26.200]  is really world domination, then yeah, we should go after them. But, you know, just
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:30.400]  because you, you have, you know, there are a lot of crazy, sworn in things we do.
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:34.520]  Yeah, but I've got their annals. They've released to universities what they've been
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:38.920]  doing for a hundred years, like, like Berkeley, and they, they're the ones that want world
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:42.440]  government. They're the ones pushing. And I think you were somewhat fair, you know,
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:46.120]  allowing me to even say that, but you've seen dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove. You've
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:50.160]  seen the order of death, the two films I have on one DVD and if folks wanted it's available
[02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:54.280]  at infowars.com, Brad, or at least your crew's seen it. I mean, we've done deep research
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:59.000]  of this. These guys are taking, I've talked to widows of Bohemian Grove members who talk
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:03.240]  about how they worship little owls in their houses at the Bohemian Grove headquarters
[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:08.680]  in San Francisco, carved on the side or men in robes about to throw a baby into a fire.
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:13.600]  I mean, I've got their own publications where it shows a child in a pool of blood. I mean,
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:14.600]  this, this,
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:17.000]  But you know what? And here, and here, and I'm, again, not defending them, but just
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.800]  putting them in context is, you know, when I was in high school, there was a, there was
[02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:26.280]  a, um, an amazing scavenger hunt, okay? And it made the New York Times, okay, from where
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:30.240]  I was in Florida, it made the New York Times a high school scavenger hunt for one reason,
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:34.480]  Alex, and it was this. It was at some dummy, at the very end of the day, when they were
[02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:37.880]  putting all the things that, that stop signs that people were supposed to steal and the,
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:40.880]  you know, and go get a sign for McDonald's and whatever else they were supposed to get
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:44.320]  a happy meal, that someone put a live human baby, okay?
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:47.360]  I hear you, Brad. We're out of time. The show's on the night. Look forward to talking
[02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:51.440]  to you soon. Let me say bye to you during the break.
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:30:01.960]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:06.240]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:10.840]  your self-produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:14.680]  of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:20.120]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Sifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:24.800]  Lungs Generator. Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:30.440]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:36.320]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas. This includes the eyes,
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:42.960]  ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:50.080]  to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to
[02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:55.120]  learn more about how the silver lung system works. As well, we are always ready to answer
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:31:00.720]  any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:05.120]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:09.400]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family
[02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:14.800]  owned and operated American company. My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly
[02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:18.880]  telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes. There
[02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:23.760]  is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:31:32.440 --> 02:32:00.440]  Let's talk to the owner of 5star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:06.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.240]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.240 --> 02:32:15.080]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:18.920]  your health and your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over
[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:23.480]  the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse
[02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:28.240]  of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest small owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:33.240]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which
[02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:37.440]  you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:41.600]  and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:45.800]  free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:52.000]  can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.innovamerica3.com. That's

[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:28.320]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, he is the number one overnight talk show host in the world.
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:33.240]  He is the second largest talk show host on the planet, but he is the number one overnight
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:39.280]  in the world, number two worldwide behind Rush Limbaugh, a close second. And you know,
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:43.960]  in the age of Anderson Cooper with a million viewers and Glenn Beck, you know, with 3 million
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:51.320]  on Fox, it's amazing when you talk about media, the only media on this planet of the thousands
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:59.000]  and thousands of choices on broadcast and mainline media, and alternative included the
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:05.840]  only audiences that are still mega huge and actually reach giant numbers of people are
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:10.040]  massive syndicated talk radio. And of course, he's right up there at the top on internet
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:17.240]  as well. And it's great to have somebody like George Norrie because I admire Art Bell incredibly
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.880]  well spoken, very intelligent. I admire him as a broadcaster, but when George Norrie took
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:27.760]  the show over seven, eight years ago and took the show in a somewhat other direction started
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:34.440]  covering a lot of hardcore political issues, forced inoculations, the private Federal Reserve,
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:41.280]  the Bilderberg group, Bohemian Grove, George Norrie pulls no punches, censors no one and
[02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:46.360]  no one anywhere in what can be called mainstream media. And of course, he's that crossover.
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:51.360]  He's both alternative and mainstream. No one can hold a candle to George Norrie. And he's
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:56.080]  with us for the next 45 minutes. We'll take calls for 15, 20 minutes or so into the next
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:05.040]  hour right now. I've got George all to myself, the website's coast2coastam.com that's coast2coastam.com
[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:08.800]  really probably no stranger to most of you out there, but if you're new listeners out
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:14.000]  there or haven't given it a listen, it's on 500 plus radio stations across the country.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.440]  In fact, George, I know the show just keeps, keeps, keeps growing even past what Art Bell
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:23.880]  did. How many stations are you on now, George? As of yesterday, Alex, my affiliates, people
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:32.200]  sent me my monthly report. We are now on 540 stations in North America, which is an all-time
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:38.760]  high. And as you were saying, we're the second largest affiliated program in the country.
[02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:44.200]  Like a horse race, we're coming around the stretch. And I think we're going to be number
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:49.240]  one. I really do. I can feel it and I can see it. And that's our goal. So we've got
[02:35:49.240 --> 02:35:55.920]  a hard, dedicated staff. And now we're going right after one of our own syndicated folks.
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:58.840]  I want to beat him. And that's what we're going to do.
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:03.400]  Hey, well, Rush is all about the free market of ideas. And so, in fact, I've even seen
[02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:08.440]  industry publications say that if you continue to grow like this within six months to a year,
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:12.800]  you may eclipse Rush Limbaugh. That's right. So we're keeping our fingers crossed
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:16.840]  and we'll see what happens. And I'll tell you a funny story. Years ago, I was having
[02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:25.640]  lunch in Austin, Texas, and I found a black book, a small black book. I opened it up and
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:31.520]  it was the Alex Jones playbook of how to do a successful show. And it said, cover the
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:37.920]  Federal Reserve, cover inoculations. So I took it and I changed the format.
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:43.720]  Did you really find a black book? I'm kidding. It's a metaphor. Yeah. Oh, man, you are something
[02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:49.360]  else. Well, look, we have talked a lot about globalist forces, the big mega Davos, George
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:54.640]  Soros type folks who, you know, we think of it as America versus the Middle East or America
[02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:59.720]  versus Russia. No, these globalist want turmoil. They want the strategy of tension. You've
[02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:05.360]  talked so much about that. And now we see what's happening in the Middle East and the
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:12.520]  Muslim Brotherhood openly being funded by our own government, openly calling for an
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:17.360]  end of the peace treaty with Israel if they take over Egypt. And the whole world is saying,
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:21.280]  why would our government overthrow their own puppet? They're not trying to bring in a
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:26.400]  democracy, which I wish they would or a free society. They're trying to bring in something
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:34.600]  in Saudi Arabia, in Jordan, in Yemen, in Egypt that is going to destabilize the entire region.
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:38.440]  What's your view on that? Well, there's something very strange going
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.320]  on in the Middle East, Alex. And as you know, I am Middle Eastern. I'm a Christian Lebanese.
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:49.840]  My father was born in Cairo. My mother, who is Christian Lebanese, was born in Boston,
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:55.200]  Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, actually. I know the Middle East probably better than most
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:00.760]  national radio talk show host. I was raised in that. I mean, we eat the food. We know
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:08.800]  the culture. I speak broken Arabic. I mean, I know the Middle East. And there's a situation
[02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:15.640]  out there that is very scary right now. And that is, you just don't know who the players
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:23.160]  are. And by that, I mean, governments have propped up dictatorship regimes for years.
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:29.240]  We did it with Saddam Hussein. We've done it with Mubarak. And the people of these countries
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:35.440]  at this point are fed up with it. Whether they hate America or not, and that we can
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:42.000]  talk about in a moment, they are fed up with the dictators controlling their destiny. The
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:49.680]  unemployment rate in Egypt is absolutely ridiculous. Those people of young age, the unemployment
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:56.760]  rate has got to be over 40 to 50 percent. People are existing on a few dollars a day.
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:01.120]  And they're at a point where they said, enough is enough. Now, the problem with all this
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:08.360]  is, is you just don't know who's instigating how it started. I mean, we saw what happened
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:13.560]  in Tunisia weeks ago, and now all of a sudden it's filtered into Yemen. It's filtered
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:20.280]  into Egypt. And you don't know if the globalists are behind it or not. And it's very frustrating.
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:26.160]  I think what happened is Mubarak had to go. He's been in power for 30 years, and governments
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:32.120]  probably said, he's enough of this guy. Let's get something fresh in here. But the population
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:37.560]  of those countries took things into their own hands through the power of the Internet,
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:41.600]  through the power of Facebook, through the power of Twitter, something they've never
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:47.840]  anticipated before. And these people have organized their own peaceful protests.
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:54.760]  Now, just yesterday, we saw what happened in Cairo with Mubarak supporters, henchmen,
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:00.960]  who started causing problems, shooting and everything else. Now, the place is in chaos.
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:05.280]  I think Egypt's going to collapse, and I don't know what direction, honestly, it's
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:06.280]  going to go.
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:10.720]  Well, George, I'm going to put a headline up on the TV screen for PrismPlanet.tv viewers,
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:16.160]  but for listeners, the London Telegraph, the Associated Press, they all reported U.S. government.
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:21.720]  Here's the headline, Egypt protest, America's secret backing for rebel leaders behind uprising.
[02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:26.440]  And now it's confirmed, they met a year ago, six months ago, and again, three weeks ago,
[02:40:26.440 --> 02:40:31.360]  with the Muslim Brotherhood, who are openly now saying they're going to overthrow all
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:37.240]  of the regimes, including the Jordanians, the Saudi leadership, who I'm no fan of any
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:41.160]  of them. I mean, I've been a big critic of Haas-e-Mubarak and the black sites and the
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:46.960]  torture sites and the ghost sites. But at the same time, then you see them maneuvering
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:54.400]  the Muslim Brotherhood and this Al-Barity, who's this big U.N. chief, who's a globalist,
[02:40:54.400 --> 02:40:57.560]  and our government says, oh, we don't really want freedom there. We just want something
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:04.840]  new. And then now know this group that George Soros funds, the crisis group, is involved.
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:07.920]  And then suddenly they're announcing, we're going to take over, and we're going to break
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:12.480]  our peace treaty with Israel, and Israel's freaking out. I mean, that looks like the
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:18.160]  Order Out of Chaos card. Here's a headline today. Muslim Brotherhood wants into Egypt,
[02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:23.120]  Israeli peace deal. I mean, this is some scary stuff, but we know the globalists again want
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:24.560]  to play countries off against each other.
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:30.400]  Oh, there's no question about it. My father, when I was growing up as a boy, Detroit, Michigan,
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:34.960]  was a member of an organization called the Mardin Club. Now, Mardin was in Turkey. We
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:39.560]  had a lot of relatives who were also born out there. We're not Turkish, but that's where
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:44.600]  they were. And in Detroit, they had this building. They had a club that was called the Mardin
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:48.240]  Club. And I would go with them. I was eight years old, nine years old. I would go with
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:52.440]  them when they would get together on Friday nights or Saturday nights. And this is what
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:58.640]  they did. They ate Middle Eastern food. They played Middle Eastern music. They played, well,
[02:41:58.640 --> 02:42:04.240]  I thought it was Domino's, but it was a different kind of game. And it just had a great time.
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:07.760]  There was nothing clandestine. They never talked about overthrowing governments. They
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:12.880]  loved America. They were immigrants who came here legally. Something strange about the
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:19.240]  Muslim Brotherhood, it was formed in Egypt a long time ago as a peaceful organization
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:25.200]  to promote Islam. That's what they wanted to do. That's what their intent was. Along
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:32.400]  the line, some people infiltrated that organization and started spouting the hatred that we see
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:33.400]  today.
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:36.080]  British intelligence, that's on record. They want to destabilize.
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:44.440]  Osama bin Laden was basically part of that organization and broke away because that group
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:50.120]  at the time did not want to be violent. They were peaceful. Now, whether it's political
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:56.480]  or not, during 9-11, they came out and condemned that horrible situation. But here's the problem
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:01.600]  today. Number one, Alex, as you and I know when you talked with me on Coast to Coast,
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:07.360]  we don't know who to believe anymore. We know a couple things that are true. And that is,
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:12.320]  the globalists want to control this planet. The globalists will do whatever they have
[02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:20.200]  to do in order to disrupt all of us. I am so convinced at this point that if every person
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:26.960]  who hated America for whatever reason said, you know what, we want peace, let's make this
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:34.080]  work, we're done with violence, I'm convinced the globalists would do things and blame it
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:40.840]  on those people again so you don't know who to believe anymore. And I am definitely afraid
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:48.520]  that this planet is heading toward some kind of massive destruction in terms of political
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:55.040]  leanings, that there may be nothing we can do except to continue to fight on the air
[02:43:55.040 --> 02:44:01.520]  and do what we're doing. I find it amazing that you and I continue to talk without anybody
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:02.520]  clipping the wires.
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:06.200]  Well, that was the next issue I was going to raise. I want to get back into geopolitically
[02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:11.360]  what's happening with the dollar devaluation, now putting incredible pressure on countries
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:17.240]  like Egypt where right at half the population is on $2 a day, the IMF World Bank pressuring
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:22.920]  them to cut the food allotment, 43 million Americans now on food stamps. So the big central
[02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:29.280]  banks, the globalists, trigger a political atmosphere that they know is going to cause
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:35.240]  upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa, then they roll in with the quote revolutionaries
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:39.640]  knowing that revolution was already coming so they're going to use it to put in a new
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:44.080]  system and then it looks like it's going to be a system that wants to have war with
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.960]  Israel so it's proof right there that this unseen hand is now coming out in the open.
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:51.960]  But I want to get more into that with you George in a moment, but first you brought
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.640]  up censorship. We have the FCC announcing that they want to run the Internet and control
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:00.160]  it. We've got all these diversities ours at the FCC saying they want to restrict free
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:05.200]  speech. We have MSNBC now saying the Tea Party is like the quote Muslim Brotherhood
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:10.600]  and radical and dangerous. That came out last night with Chris Matthews. We have the White
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:16.160]  House regulations are calling to restrict free speech. We have the Internet kill switch
[02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:20.640]  being announced similar to what we just saw in Egypt. We're now really starting to see
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:25.640]  a move where don't talk about political stuff or you could cause another Tucson shooting
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:29.440]  when we know the guy was drugged out of his mind and had nothing to do with politics.
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:33.440]  We're finally not just seeing an attack on the Second Amendment. We're seeing open trial
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:38.240]  balloons to go after the first as we go into this global depression. George Norrie what's
[02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:43.880]  your view on that? Well first of all I can't believe but I had an email after the Tucson
[02:45:43.880 --> 02:45:51.960]  tragedy when I called that shooter on the air a whacked out lunatic and the next day
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:58.760]  I got an email from a woman who said how can you do that to him? He's got rights too and
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:06.400]  I went man these people just don't understand. They just don't understand. When I was in
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:13.040]  school I was told two things. One is the airwaves belong to the public. The public's
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:19.960]  interests, convenience and necessity. They're not owned by me. They're not owned by corporations.
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:26.600]  The public owns those airwaves. We were under the Fairness Dock rent when I was in broadcasting
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:34.120]  in 1971. It looked like a long time ago. It didn't bother me. I mean I think broadcasters
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:42.320]  have a responsibility Alex to balance their shows. I think if you or if I say something
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:49.280]  about someone or someone we should back it up with facts and also give them the opportunity
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:55.800]  or someone to explain how they feel. There's nothing wrong with that. But what's happened
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:47:02.040]  today is everybody's gone in these different tangents, these different directions and they
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:08.280]  forgot about the most important thing that has kept American broadcasting so strong
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:14.160]  and that is balance and we just don't have that anymore. When I started tweaking coast
[02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:20.720]  to coast eight years ago I did it for one main reason. This planet was changing and
[02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:27.120]  changing very fast and it needed voices and it needed truth. We still do as you well know
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:32.920]  the ghosts, the UFOs, the bigfoots, the mysteries. We do all that stuff. I love that. But we
[02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:39.880]  had to add the other ingredient and specifically after 9-11 occurred, regardless of how you
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:46.760]  believe it happened or who did it, we needed to tweak this program and I did that. I devote
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:55.080]  the first hour to hard news, breaking issues with a coast to coast Alex Jones type flair
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:48:00.920]  to it. I don't want to do what Main Street does. By the time I'm on the air that stuff's
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:05.720]  been beaten like a horse and I don't want to go in that direction but we will cover
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:12.240]  those topics. But I think governments are taking a very close look at all kinds of things
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:17.880]  right now including a kill switch for the internet as they saw what happened in Egypt
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:22.080]  and I think these are very dangerous, very dangerous times for us.
[02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:26.320]  Well sure, I agree with you but you talk about imbalance. When we have JP Morgan and Goldman
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:31.840]  Sachs knowingly creating trillions and derivatives, knowing it's worthless, selling it to people,
[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:35.600]  the demanding taxpayer money for it, when you have the government trying to shut down
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:42.440]  power plants in the US and then building power plants in China and we're having rolling blackouts
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:48.040]  and we have the imbalance of all of this corruption, obviously people are going to get angry, they're
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:52.960]  going to get upset and try to bring balance back to that and speaking of what's happened
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:57.720]  in the economy worldwide, every economist I have on says we're already in a depression
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:02.200]  and we have incredible unemployment but where do you see the economy going? Where do you
[02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:04.960]  see the globalist pushing this?
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:10.800]  Alex, let me tell you something, I have never seen a situation where more people were so
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:18.800]  destined to or in trouble in all my life. I mean personally I'm helping my three children
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:24.840]  with their mortgages and their car payments because they're my kids. I can't see them
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:32.240]  tossed out. They've got some problems financially as most Americans do right now. I have had
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:39.120]  friends call me asking for $1,000 or $2,000 that they say I want to borrow. Now you know
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:44.360]  when you lend money to a friend, you're not getting it back, it's gone and so you do it
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:50.680]  but I've never seen a situation where more people were so backed up and it's not like
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:54.280]  they're going to bars every night and going out to party with them.
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:56.560]  And the media is telling us everything's great though.
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:04.200]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean this is what's happening. Those of us who are working, you and me and
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:10.840]  other people are doing okay. We're paying our bills, we're buying things once in a while,
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:16.440]  we're keeping the economy going. I mean the automobile sales in the U.S. have gone up.
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:22.360]  People who are working are spending their money and they're doing okay but the number
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:30.160]  of people who aren't working and who aren't okay continues to grow dramatically and here's
[02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:37.680]  the problem. When you create a society between the haves and the have nots, when that disparity
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:44.800]  begins to get wider and wider and wider, we are going to have a disaster. What is happening
[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:47.200]  in Egypt can happen here.
[02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:52.120]  Amazing. George Norris, our guest, will continue. We're going to do 15-20 minutes of calls
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:59.320]  in the next hour for George. Specific questions for him, 800-259-9231. Stay with us a lot
[02:50:59.320 --> 02:51:01.320]  more coming up.
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:03.720]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:09.240]  We are part of a new world order. A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:13.400]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:14.400]  documents.
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:18.840]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:21.320]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:26.160]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the
[02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:27.400]  world.
[02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:32.360]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:34.840]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:39.320]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:40.320]  financial system.
[02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:43.200]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:47.280]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I've got news
[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:49.720]  for you. You're everyone else.

[02:52:15.320 --> 02:52:17.720]  When I first joined I was being sued.
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:22.840]  So I used the program methods and after filing one piece of paper the collection lawsuit
[02:52:22.840 --> 02:52:23.840]  was dismissed.
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:27.240]  With Zero Debt in 90 days your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:29.200]  There is no other program of its kind.

[02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:10.100]  costs, but if you can believe this, 25 cents a day, but they can get downloads, podcasting,
[02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:14.300]  and it's really an exciting facet of listening to the program, along with the terrestrial
[02:55:14.300 --> 02:55:20.060]  radio station, which has really been the staple of Coast to Coast over all these years.
[02:55:20.060 --> 02:55:21.740]  It continues to grow, Alex.
[02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:27.780]  Just yesterday, I signed an extension taking me through 2013, and the network at the same
[02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:33.100]  time said, hey, sometime this year, let's talk about a five-year extension beyond that.
[02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:36.180]  So you know, I'm going to end up being the casey-casey of radio.
[02:55:36.180 --> 02:55:41.260]  I mean, I'm going to just hang in there as long as I can, bringing everybody the truth.
[02:55:41.260 --> 02:55:42.460]  We've got a couple of books out.
[02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:50.580]  My partner for writing, Bill Burns, who does an incredible job doing 98% of the late work
[02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:56.020]  for these things, worker in the light, and journey to the light, the worker, of course,
[02:55:56.020 --> 02:55:57.260]  being the first one in journey.
[02:55:57.260 --> 02:56:01.820]  I've got another one coming out in the fall with Rosemary Allen Giley called Talking to
[02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:05.900]  the Dead, which is more like the old traditional Coast to Coast show.
[02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:11.980]  But you know, I've got a two-fold goal, and that is one, stay healthy, because I had a
[02:56:11.980 --> 02:56:18.100]  lot of problems 10 years ago, and I didn't eat right, and I did stupid stuff, and I decided,
[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:20.300]  you know what, enough is this.
[02:56:20.300 --> 02:56:26.260]  And I got into a major workout regimen, and eating properly, and taking natural supplements,
[02:56:26.260 --> 02:56:30.220]  and I hope to God we continue to take natural supplements.
[02:56:30.220 --> 02:56:32.140]  But that's the direction I'm going.
[02:56:32.140 --> 02:56:36.860]  Oh yeah, you're in great shape, and expanding on that, George.
[02:56:36.860 --> 02:56:41.220]  You also have done quite a few national TV shows on sci-fi, channel, and others.
[02:56:41.220 --> 02:56:43.100]  I mean, you're doing a lot.
[02:56:43.100 --> 02:56:44.460]  Yeah, I am.
[02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:49.540]  Henry Winkler, the font, approached us a couple months ago, and he would like to do
[02:56:49.540 --> 02:56:55.060]  a Twilight Zone type show, and said, look, I want you to be Rod Sterling.
[02:56:55.060 --> 02:56:56.540]  So let's see what he works on.
[02:56:56.540 --> 02:57:03.980]  You know, the bottom line here is, I want this program to succeed, I want you to succeed
[02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:04.980]  for people.
[02:57:04.980 --> 02:57:05.980]  I'm going to tell you a funny story.
[02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:10.020]  Well, as you know, I go back and forth between St. Louis and Los Angeles.
[02:57:10.020 --> 02:57:14.460]  You know, I've been with my family since St. Louis, so I have a chance to go see my kids.
[02:57:14.460 --> 02:57:20.540]  My soon-to-be-six godchildren, and we just built this little facility in Hawaii, by the
[02:57:20.540 --> 02:57:24.100]  way, that I can pop up there and do a show out of there, too.
[02:57:24.100 --> 02:57:29.140]  It gives us that flavor way out there, but I'm at my favorite restaurant in St. Louis
[02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:35.540]  called the Cafe Napoli, and I'm sitting there, I sit in the corner, and a guy comes in, and
[02:57:35.540 --> 02:57:37.540]  he's staring at me.
[02:57:37.540 --> 02:57:39.660]  And I'm like, oh boy, here we go.
[02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:44.860]  And a young guy, he's next-core, he comes up to me and goes, oh my god, it's you.
[02:57:44.860 --> 02:57:47.820]  And I said, I figured, oh, I'll sign the autograph.
[02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:50.580]  I always do that, or if they want a picture, I'll do that.
[02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:51.580]  You know, it's for you.
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:53.300]  I don't charge for that stuff.
[02:57:53.300 --> 02:57:55.860]  I'm not like some of the baseball players.
[02:57:55.860 --> 02:57:58.140]  And he comes up to me and he goes, my god, it's you.
[02:57:58.140 --> 02:57:59.140]  It's you.
[02:57:59.140 --> 02:58:02.940]  And I said, yeah, I put out my hand and he went, god, I love Alex Jones.
[02:58:02.940 --> 02:58:05.940]  I went, hey, what?
[02:58:05.940 --> 02:58:10.660]  Hey, I get the same thing all the time, but George, that's what I love about you.
[02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:15.140]  You reach more people than anybody in the world on any media outlet in a single day
[02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:16.740]  except for Rush Limbaugh.
[02:58:16.740 --> 02:58:21.180]  I mean, there's no doubting that, and you are such a humble, nice, friendly guy, especially
[02:58:21.180 --> 02:58:25.060]  in person when we've gone out to eat before and been able to hang out with you.
[02:58:25.060 --> 02:58:30.900]  And of course, Tom Danheiser, George Norrie, most radio talk show hosts are pretty arrogant.
[02:58:30.900 --> 02:58:35.060]  And most of them don't have other radio talk show hosts on their show, but George has myself
[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:38.420]  on him, any other talk show hosts, because he's such a confident guy and he's into the
[02:58:38.420 --> 02:58:39.420]  information.
[02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:40.420]  Back in one minute.
[02:58:40.420 --> 02:58:50.420]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:50.420 --> 02:58:55.180]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:58:55.180 --> 02:58:57.380]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:58:57.380 --> 02:59:01.180]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:59:01.180 --> 02:59:04.700]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest
[02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:07.020]  of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[02:59:07.020 --> 02:59:09.020]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:59:09.020 --> 02:59:12.020]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[02:59:12.020 --> 02:59:15.980]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider
[02:59:15.980 --> 02:59:18.540]  a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:20.900]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:59:20.900 --> 02:59:25.140]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial
[02:59:25.140 --> 02:59:26.140]  resource.
[02:59:26.140 --> 02:59:30.580]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks,
[02:59:30.580 --> 02:59:31.580]  or metals.
[02:59:31.580 --> 02:59:36.300]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long
[02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:37.300]  term.
[02:59:37.300 --> 02:59:40.100]  This will freeze the cost to your food while you can still afford it.
[02:59:40.100 --> 02:59:45.820]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet, or call 800-409-5633.
[02:59:45.820 --> 02:59:52.820]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com, or call 800-409-5633.
[03:00:15.820 --> 03:00:25.540]  I want to warn folks about corrupt things that are happening.
[03:00:25.540 --> 03:00:31.500]  I get angry about being oppressed, and he's the biggest outlet to ever just give me free
[03:00:31.500 --> 03:00:36.700]  reign and to reach 16 million people a night, and I've been on the show probably 60, 70
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:37.700]  times.
[03:00:37.700 --> 03:00:40.860]  I haven't counted it in the last seven and a half years, and he took a risk putting Alex
[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:44.620]  Jones on, and we were growing exponentially way back then.
[03:00:44.620 --> 03:00:50.140]  But now, it just supercharged us, like nitrous oxide on a drag racer.
[03:00:50.140 --> 03:00:53.900]  And I just want to thank you again, George, for helping me get the word out.
[03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:57.820]  Well, Alex, you earned your way on the coast to coast.
[03:00:57.820 --> 03:01:02.220]  When I started doing the program, I didn't know who you were, you know, I was in the
[03:01:02.220 --> 03:01:07.220]  paranormal, the unusual, and I kept getting emails from people saying, you ought to put
[03:01:07.220 --> 03:01:09.380]  talk show host Alex Jones on.
[03:01:09.380 --> 03:01:14.140]  Well, at that point, brand new, just replaced our belt, and it's the competitive here doing
[03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:15.140]  what I'm doing.
[03:01:15.140 --> 03:01:18.620]  We're going, God, what do I want to promote another talk show host for?
[03:01:18.620 --> 03:01:22.140]  But I started getting more and more and more of these emails, and I said, you know what,
[03:01:22.140 --> 03:01:23.820]  I'd better start listening to this guy.
[03:01:23.820 --> 03:01:29.300]  So I Googled you, upcameprisonplanet.com, infowars.com, I started listening to some
[03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:32.660]  of the things you did, and I said, I like this guy.
[03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:35.300]  And I said, you know, he's like a little brother to me.
[03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:40.980]  And I said, you know, the things he says are right on.
[03:01:40.980 --> 03:01:45.940]  And then you and I had that first program, and it just exploded our phone lines.
[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:50.220]  And that's been our relationship ever, ever since, other than when you pushed me into
[03:01:50.220 --> 03:01:51.980]  a lake in Austin, Texas.
[03:01:51.980 --> 03:01:53.660]  Hey, you got to stop with that joke.
[03:01:53.660 --> 03:01:56.860]  I've had people come up here on the street and go, why'd you push George Norrie into
[03:01:56.860 --> 03:01:57.860]  the pond?
[03:01:57.860 --> 03:01:58.860]  And I'm like, I did.
[03:01:58.860 --> 03:01:59.860]  It's on YouTube.
[03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:00.860]  I don't know.
[03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:06.580]  I think if you just go into the search on YouTube and go Norrie Falls, you'll see a seven-second
[03:02:06.580 --> 03:02:13.460]  clip coming out of the radio station KLBJ at night, you, me, Dan Heiser.
[03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:17.060]  And I hit what I thought was a half-inch puddle of water.
[03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:20.340]  I had the sprinklers going on all night.
[03:02:20.340 --> 03:02:25.940]  And I hit a half-inch pool of water that ended up being two feet deep.
[03:02:25.940 --> 03:02:29.860]  And I went right down into it and right on my face.
[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:34.100]  And I had that big event, as you know, the Talk Fest the next day.
[03:02:34.100 --> 03:02:35.900]  I didn't have any backup clothes.
[03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:38.180]  I was soaked to the gills.
[03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:41.380]  And Dan Heiser had to go out and buy me clothes.
[03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:47.580]  I'm in my hotel room, stark naked, waiting for him to get in there with new shoes, pants
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:51.780]  and a shirt, and down come the window washers.
[03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:55.140]  They come right down to my level and I'm standing right in front of them.
[03:02:55.140 --> 03:02:58.540]  No clothes on and the guy just keeps cleaning the window.
[03:02:58.540 --> 03:02:59.540]  No big deal.
[03:02:59.540 --> 03:03:04.860]  Well, I just want to say we just played the video and I am a good eight feet from you
[03:03:04.860 --> 03:03:06.300]  and you fall down.
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:07.820]  It's Dan Heiser that's behind you.
[03:03:07.820 --> 03:03:08.820]  I'm behind you, Harvey.
[03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:11.740]  I was like, well, sure, you're eight feet away from me.
[03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:15.620]  Listen, we've only got one more segment with you, but it's a long segment, 12 minutes or
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:16.620]  so.
[03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:19.300]  We're going to talk to Henry, Al, Bell, Noel, and Tony.
[03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:20.900]  Quick questions or comments for George Norton.
[03:03:20.900 --> 03:03:23.500]  We come back in this next segment.
[03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:26.540]  But what's coming up tonight on Coast to Coast AM?
[03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:29.820]  What's coming up in the next few days?
[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:33.820]  First hour, we'll talk a little bit about Egypt and some other mainstream issues with
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:38.980]  that coast flavor and then a full show, a little more coasty tonight as we talk with
[03:03:38.980 --> 03:03:44.700]  Dr. Richard Boylan about what he believes to be anti-UFO machines that are flying around
[03:03:44.700 --> 03:03:45.700]  all over the planet.
[03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:50.980]  So we'll do that with them and then Friday I always dedicated some fun, unusual things.
[03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:55.100]  We're going to be talking to the people from Ripley's, believe it or not, and then we'll
[03:03:55.100 --> 03:03:58.380]  have open lines later on in the program on Friday night out.
[03:03:58.380 --> 03:04:05.020]  We've only got about a minute, but what did you think of that strange UFO over the Dome
[03:04:05.020 --> 03:04:07.020]  of the Rock in Jerusalem?
[03:04:07.020 --> 03:04:08.020]  The Dome of the Rock.
[03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:09.020]  Bizarre timing.
[03:04:09.020 --> 03:04:10.220]  I mean, things are happening.
[03:04:10.220 --> 03:04:11.220]  They're weird.
[03:04:11.220 --> 03:04:16.940]  Now, in this particular case, I don't know if it's a sign from above or whether someone's
[03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:20.340]  got some drone out there just checking things out.
[03:04:20.340 --> 03:04:21.340]  Who knows?
[03:04:21.340 --> 03:04:23.660]  But I'm telling you, we get some bizarre things.
[03:04:23.660 --> 03:04:27.420]  The strangest story, of course, is the crop formation in Indonesia.
[03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:33.700]  I mean, the farmer said he was there six hours before and there was nothing there.
[03:04:33.700 --> 03:04:37.420]  You can't make it that fast, even with 90 people.
[03:04:37.420 --> 03:04:38.420]  It makes no sense.
[03:04:38.420 --> 03:04:41.740]  Yeah, I think they're really gearing up for a fake type UFO invasion.
[03:04:41.740 --> 03:04:45.500]  We know under Project Bluebeam, that's there as well, and they've got this battle of Los
[03:04:45.500 --> 03:04:46.500]  Angeles coming out.
[03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:48.900]  I mean, they're really pushing it.
[03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:51.380]  George Norrie is our guest, coast2coastam.com.
[03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:54.140]  Our sites are infowars.com and prismplanet.com.

[03:05:03.580 --> 03:05:04.700]  This is not a drill.
[03:05:04.700 --> 03:05:07.300]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[03:05:07.300 --> 03:05:09.180]  Gun cells are on a staggering pace.
[03:05:09.180 --> 03:05:13.420]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want
[03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:16.260]  your guns and will do anything to get them.
[03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:20.700]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.

[03:05:23.420 --> 03:05:26.100]  Prepare to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[03:05:26.100 --> 03:05:28.020]  How to create the perfect hiding place.
[03:05:28.020 --> 03:05:31.260]  As well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[03:05:31.260 --> 03:05:32.980]  Under any circumstance.
[03:05:32.980 --> 03:05:36.820]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons
[03:05:36.820 --> 03:05:40.100]  safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[03:05:40.100 --> 03:05:41.100]  But listen up.
[03:05:41.100 --> 03:05:45.500]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without
[03:05:45.500 --> 03:05:46.940]  warning at any time.

[03:06:01.580 --> 03:06:02.580]  Right now.
[03:06:02.580 --> 03:06:06.380]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:06:06.380 --> 03:06:09.500]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:06:09.500 --> 03:06:13.860]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:14.860]  at home.
[03:06:14.860 --> 03:06:19.500]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:20.500]  calling the shots.
[03:06:20.500 --> 03:06:25.780]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:29.180]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:06:29.180 --> 03:06:35.020]  The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[03:06:35.020 --> 03:06:36.020]  world government.
[03:06:36.020 --> 03:06:38.420]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:42.580]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:48.380]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[03:06:48.380 --> 03:06:49.780]  of the Republic.

[03:08:06.180 --> 03:08:26.860]  All right, you've only got him for one more segment because he's got to get some sleep
[03:08:26.860 --> 03:08:38.940]  for
[03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:45.340]  George with like what does he think of all the crazy weather the weather weapons Al Gore sing the cold weather is caused by global warming
[03:08:45.620 --> 03:08:47.620]  The carbon taxes
[03:08:47.700 --> 03:08:51.940]  The government trying to shut down more power plants, but I don't want to hog him
[03:08:51.940 --> 03:08:56.140]  But but briefly what's your view on the carbon taxes crippling our power plants?
[03:08:56.140 --> 03:08:58.940]  We can't build new ones and we're having blackouts everywhere
[03:08:59.580 --> 03:09:02.060]  It's all a scam to make money Alex
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:09.660]  I mean this whole thing without what Al Gore doesn't understand and what so many globalists who support
[03:09:10.340 --> 03:09:12.340]  global warming is
[03:09:12.340 --> 03:09:14.340]  That we are in an earth cycle
[03:09:15.060 --> 03:09:19.060]  This solar system and the planets in it are warming up
[03:09:19.700 --> 03:09:20.820]  Unless I'm wrong
[03:09:20.820 --> 03:09:26.180]  I don't think we have plants and factories and cars on Mars and Jupiter and Saturn
[03:09:26.180 --> 03:09:34.020]  But those planets are warming up as well the solar system goes through a cycle and we're going through one right now
[03:09:34.020 --> 03:09:36.020]  Now is mankind?
[03:09:36.380 --> 03:09:41.100]  Contributing speeding things up. That's a possibility. I'm not going to rule that out
[03:09:41.140 --> 03:09:43.420]  But this was going to happen in any way
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:49.140]  It'll go away and it'll start again whether we have people on this planet or not
[03:09:49.140 --> 03:09:56.860]  But there's this scam to make poor money squeezing us. I mean we should do a show on red light cameras and the ridiculousness
[03:09:57.100 --> 03:10:02.540]  Of what they're doing to try to raise more money revenue. You talked to any police officer in this country
[03:10:02.540 --> 03:10:06.940]  They're opposed to that. They wish these cameras would fall off the pole
[03:10:08.100 --> 03:10:14.100]  Well in San Diego they were forced to remove a few years ago because they weren't even following the law and they were caught shortening
[03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:21.380]  The the yellow part of the light so people couldn't stop and it was causing accidents. Absolutely going to phone calls
[03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:24.420]  Henry in California. You're on the air with George Norrie
[03:10:24.940 --> 03:10:29.060]  Hi, I was wondering about George's opinion about certain caller
[03:10:29.060 --> 03:10:33.260]  I'm sorry certain guests and the ability for them to just suddenly
[03:10:33.940 --> 03:10:41.340]  Dres out and it's never with a guest that's talking about, you know, a light thing like tarot cards or you know
[03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:46.660]  Something like the Easter Bunny. It's always about a hard-hitting black budget issue
[03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:54.700]  You know Henry, let me tell you something like Jordan Maxwell who's been on the program and just when he's ready to get into the meat
[03:10:54.700 --> 03:11:00.340]  Of what he's on the show for his phone goes dead or something bizarre like that happens
[03:11:00.540 --> 03:11:05.700]  It happens a lot and as you know, I don't believe in coincidences
[03:11:05.700 --> 03:11:12.620]  I mean, there's got to be there's some coming is phone kill switch somewhere. Well, we know just like the internet call switch
[03:11:13.140 --> 03:11:15.380]  Yeah, so I mean though, I think those things happen
[03:11:15.820 --> 03:11:17.980]  Well anything else Henry
[03:11:19.100 --> 03:11:27.060]  Does he have an opinion about certain ventral well in my opinion ventriloquists that will call in and misrepresent themselves
[03:11:27.220 --> 03:11:29.860]  I don't want to say their names, but I really think
[03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:39.140]  Alex has been victim to some of these gag pranks, especially when they did the TSA special that can bypass screeners and but I really think these
[03:11:39.140 --> 03:11:44.300]  They're a professional. Let me stop you because I haven't heard of this, but it wouldn't be for entwiloquists
[03:11:44.300 --> 03:11:45.700]  It would be a
[03:11:45.700 --> 03:11:49.220]  Imitator somebody calling in and posing as someone I have that happen a lot
[03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:55.700]  But more than that they have these computer boards where they record my voice and other people's voices and they have hundreds of statements
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:12:00.140]  And then they call into shows and have me threaten people or they call old ladies
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:05.460]  And I've actually had the cops call me before and I've had people call and say quit calling my house
[03:12:05.460 --> 03:12:09.020]  And they're doing this is a form of harassment. I appreciate your call
[03:12:10.020 --> 03:12:12.420]  Well, that hasn't happened to me if that's bizarre
[03:12:13.220 --> 03:12:16.660]  Do you know what he's talking about the TSA special you did and something happening?
[03:12:16.660 --> 03:12:25.300]  No, I don't but you know, we have done the programs where we've had guests on and they have mysteriously been put the way
[03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:30.060]  And then we try to call them back and they never come back online again. That's strange stuff
[03:12:30.380 --> 03:12:33.580]  Yeah, I've heard that happen over the years. It's happened to Art Bell as well
[03:12:34.300 --> 03:12:41.380]  Just a brief story when I was at Bilderberg and covering it on your show in 2008 and Chantilly and Obama was coming to be there
[03:12:41.380 --> 03:12:46.580]  After it was over. We were at a steakhouse. It had just ended after the two days. I called my wife
[03:12:46.580 --> 03:12:51.900]  She told me one of her parents was sick hung up the phone and somebody called and said, you know
[03:12:51.900 --> 03:12:54.140]  We're basically from the government. We want you to know
[03:12:54.140 --> 03:12:58.920]  We just heard what your husband said to you so they let her know they were listening and then they basically, you know
[03:12:59.060 --> 03:13:02.220]  Threatened her and did some other things. So yes, that stuff goes on
[03:13:02.220 --> 03:13:12.020]  Well and it has been going on Alex for a long long time, but it's getting worse. Don't you think it certainly is it's it's it's crazy
[03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:14.340]  Let's talk to Al in Texas
[03:13:14.340 --> 03:13:20.780]  You're on with the biggest talk show host overnight in the world and about to take the crown from Rush Limbaugh is the biggest period
[03:13:21.340 --> 03:13:25.100]  George Norrie Al you're on the air. Hi guys much respect to you both
[03:13:25.100 --> 03:13:32.820]  Thank you touching on the the the telephone phasing out. I used to see the same thing on matrix news matrix news network
[03:13:33.060 --> 03:13:37.140]  When I would watch that when I lived up north, but my main question for you, Mr.
[03:13:37.140 --> 03:13:43.300]  Norrie, I don't get a chance to listen to your show a lot. I'm usually asleep. I have to work very early in the morning
[03:13:44.140 --> 03:13:47.740]  my idea listen to Alex Jones and I've heard his take on China and
[03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:53.420]  I agree with a lot of what mr. Jones has to say about China, but I would like to get your
[03:13:53.420 --> 03:13:54.780]  or
[03:13:54.780 --> 03:14:01.740]  Take on what exactly you think or what you think about the Chinese takeover and how everything is going over there
[03:14:01.740 --> 03:14:05.740]  And you can't buy a boat a box of matches at Kroger's without it being made in China
[03:14:05.740 --> 03:14:11.860]  Sure good good good question Al from Texas. Thanks for the call George your view on who's in town badmouthing the dollar
[03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:18.260]  At the state dinner having their pianist play an anti-america song being the biggest owner of our debt. What's your view?
[03:14:18.260 --> 03:14:24.040]  Well, first of all real quickly you can always get stream link for 25 cents a day and
[03:14:24.380 --> 03:14:28.620]  Podcasts that the show will be waiting for you in the morning right at the right there for you
[03:14:28.620 --> 03:14:34.260]  So we get off the worry about sleep China has put together one of the most brilliant economic
[03:14:34.820 --> 03:14:41.860]  Tactics I've ever seen here was a nation 30 35 40 years ago that could barely do anything now
[03:14:41.860 --> 03:14:49.220]  They're pumping out everything in a massively growing economy. They are brilliant at what they do unfortunately
[03:14:49.780 --> 03:14:55.780]  75 people run that communist country and they've got their eyes on Taiwan and everything else
[03:14:55.780 --> 03:15:02.060]  And they're not going to stop they have incredible patients and they will continue to do what they do
[03:15:02.060 --> 03:15:05.620]  They already own most of America they own our debt
[03:15:05.620 --> 03:15:11.500]  We are slaves to them and it's just a matter of time when they decide to call in their chips. I
[03:15:13.380 --> 03:15:20.260]  Agree with that statement and there's the other facet of the globalist making deals with China and then using regulations to shut down
[03:15:20.540 --> 03:15:22.540]  China's competition here in the US
[03:15:22.700 --> 03:15:28.460]  That's what Kissinger and others are all about and it's so dangerous Bell in South Carolina. You're Alma George Norrie
[03:15:30.940 --> 03:15:32.940]  Hello, yes, go ahead Bill
[03:15:32.940 --> 03:15:37.940]  Hi, I just wanted to say mr. Norrie that I'm very happy with the way
[03:15:38.940 --> 03:15:43.900]  The show is going now. I'm really excited about what you're doing and you're such a beautiful soul
[03:15:45.980 --> 03:15:53.300]  About the weather modification I have a link for everybody this particular document pretty much answered the question
[03:15:54.060 --> 03:15:58.340]  for me of whether or not the weather is being controlled and and
[03:15:58.340 --> 03:16:05.900]  The logical conclusion that I come to is that yes, it is always and that every event is being manufactured
[03:16:06.740 --> 03:16:10.420]  The it's kind of a long link, but it's on the CFTC
[03:16:11.580 --> 03:16:15.860]  Gov site. Oh the CFR has a report about weather manipulation
[03:16:16.740 --> 03:16:21.980]  Send us that link send that link to George. I appreciate your call bill George more and more
[03:16:21.980 --> 03:16:25.340]  They just admit that they're doing geo engineering. Oh, of course they are
[03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:28.900]  We know what's been happening in Dubai and every place else to tap me now
[03:16:28.900 --> 03:16:33.660]  Let me give out my email as Alex any of your listeners who want to send me material
[03:16:34.540 --> 03:16:39.780]  George at coast to that put that to in there coast to coast a m. Dot com
[03:16:40.340 --> 03:16:45.300]  Let's jam in a few more here because we only got about three minutes left with George. No, well in Illinois
[03:16:45.300 --> 03:16:47.140]  You're on the air with George Norrie
[03:16:47.140 --> 03:16:51.820]  God bless you both George. I heard your interview with Ty Bollinger the other night Alex you should interview him
[03:16:51.820 --> 03:16:56.220]  This guy is unbelievable. He is fighting the resistance. He is V for victory
[03:16:56.620 --> 03:17:01.100]  Two questions quickly George your thoughts on big sister homeland security
[03:17:01.380 --> 03:17:07.820]  Being brazenly out in the open with everything she will make her debut on the Super Bowl with a commercial if you see something safe
[03:17:07.820 --> 03:17:13.620]  That's right. They're using taxpayer money to force their their messages on the only victory
[03:17:13.620 --> 03:17:18.420]  We've got is they're doing away with that lousy color scheme, which I hated from the get-go
[03:17:18.420 --> 03:17:26.700]  What's your view on the telescreens going in stores all over the country saying watch your neighbor you remember years ago
[03:17:26.700 --> 03:17:32.500]  We would watch films and movies where you'd see big brother on a huge screen talking to us
[03:17:32.980 --> 03:17:38.100]  Constantly while people walked and shop. That's where we're headed. That's gonna happen
[03:17:38.100 --> 03:17:41.060]  I think it's horrible, but it's gonna happen Alex
[03:17:41.060 --> 03:17:46.020]  You're gonna have these screens all over the planet where you'll have this big brother
[03:17:46.020 --> 03:17:52.740]  Maybe even a computer animated guide looking at you, right? Just saying do this do this do this
[03:17:53.820 --> 03:17:58.940]  Unbelievable they are they're doing it. It's I mean it's happening last caller for George Norring
[03:17:58.940 --> 03:18:04.020]  You can hear more of him tonight midnight central cuz custom calm Ryan in Texas. You're on the air
[03:18:05.500 --> 03:18:08.580]  This is the first time I've actually got through I appreciate you taking my call
[03:18:08.580 --> 03:18:12.380]  I had a question for mr. Norring about the the glass tubes of Mars actually
[03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:18.420]  Well, it's an incredible story. You know if you believe that Mars was was once inhabited
[03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:25.540]  Then you have to believe that it was intelligent life and that they built structures on the mark on Mars on the moon and
[03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:32.580]  God knows where else I happen to believe that there are extraterrestrials out there in the universe
[03:18:32.660 --> 03:18:36.260]  That we've been visited before and we might even have been seated
[03:18:36.540 --> 03:18:40.820]  So it's entirely possible that there are structures on these other
[03:18:40.820 --> 03:18:44.380]  planets and moons throughout our solar system
[03:18:44.980 --> 03:18:50.180]  Well, I know this there's ice caps on Mars and they claim they found evidence that there was life there
[03:18:50.180 --> 03:18:55.540]  And I don't think we're the only creatures in you know this this universe of hundreds of billions of admitted
[03:18:56.180 --> 03:18:57.420]  galaxies
[03:18:57.420 --> 03:18:59.420]  You know the problem is there's just so much
[03:19:00.020 --> 03:19:01.420]  Conflicting information out there
[03:19:01.420 --> 03:19:07.100]  But folks can decipher through all of it and try to make up their own mind certainly at coast to coast AM comm George
[03:19:07.100 --> 03:19:11.220]  We're about to end this segment. I want to say bye to you briefly during the break
[03:19:11.220 --> 03:19:13.540]  But I just want to thank you for again
[03:19:14.300 --> 03:19:18.260]  Exposing my information to 16 million people that's 16 million every night
[03:19:18.780 --> 03:19:22.260]  Do you know a lot more than that over the years and just?
[03:19:23.140 --> 03:19:25.620]  Just appreciate the work you're doing for the First Amendment
[03:19:26.020 --> 03:19:30.980]  Well Alex, I'll continue to do it and you continue to do what you do and maybe one day
[03:19:30.980 --> 03:19:37.900]  We'll win this battle. Well, I mean we should have talked about that. Do you agree the tides turning the awakening is accelerating?
[03:19:38.100 --> 03:19:44.740]  The awakening is accelerating. I'm not sure we're winning yet, but at least it's accelerating at least we're in the fight
[03:19:44.740 --> 03:19:51.100]  Well, that's George Norrie of coast to coast AM comm second biggest indicated program in the country and going out worldwide
