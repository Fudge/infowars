[08:01.000 --> 08:06.760]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.760 --> 08:13.320]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:13.320 --> 08:29.200]  all I do is point out the asinine corruption and hypocrisy of the
[08:29.200 --> 08:34.720]  government the media the establishment I mean I point out just what's obvious
[08:34.720 --> 08:40.320]  over the last few months we have seen Republicans and Democrats we just
[08:40.320 --> 08:44.920]  observe the facts and report them being booed off the stage chanted off the
[08:44.920 --> 08:49.640]  stage they then run out of the meetings because it's always so embarrassing it
[08:49.640 --> 08:55.360]  gets on local media and then here locally on TV and radio always hear the
[08:55.360 --> 09:01.840]  newscast a very mean bad crowd who wasn't very gentlemanly and against our
[09:01.840 --> 09:06.120]  democracy was mean to the congressman of the senator of the governor and they'll
[09:06.120 --> 09:10.400]  have the governor spokesman or the senator himself or Lloyd dogged going
[09:10.400 --> 09:18.200]  it was all staged these people are just hateful and so I knew it was in the
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.720]  local news around the country that's the great part about the internet it ends
[09:21.720 --> 09:25.960]  the national news monopoly on information show local news becomes
[09:25.960 --> 09:29.560]  national news and that's what we posted in full wars dot com and prison pointed
[09:29.560 --> 09:33.080]  dot com we try to give people a clear picture of what's happening in the
[09:33.080 --> 09:40.320]  United States across the world a snapshot and in the last few months I
[09:40.320 --> 09:45.920]  mean I I don't ever hear of a town hall or an event or a meeting where the
[09:45.920 --> 09:50.240]  people don't yell and scream and go after the politicians when they push
[09:50.240 --> 09:55.800]  blanket amnesty anti-gun bills the carbon tax the government socialized
[09:55.800 --> 10:00.920]  health care the fascist health care really the euthanasia health care and
[10:00.920 --> 10:04.600]  then you know we actually get the bills and post them and then the people read
[10:04.600 --> 10:08.320]  the bills and then they go and they hear the politician lie and say that's not in
[10:08.320 --> 10:17.760]  the bill in fact I saw a clip yesterday I meant to play congressman conures in
[10:17.760 --> 10:21.440]  fact search engine this and pull it up there's too many clips too little time
[10:21.440 --> 10:28.880]  saying headlines should be conures says we don't need to read the bills or says
[10:28.880 --> 10:32.760]  it's stupid to read the bills and it was a video clip of him saying reading the
[10:32.760 --> 10:38.640]  bills is bad I mean it's like they're in an alternate dimension now he said
[10:38.640 --> 10:43.000]  what are you gonna do you read a thousand page bill no you pass it I mean
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.440]  it's it's it's like a capitulation to corruption the lobbyist right a 1300
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.560]  page bill and then 10 minutes before they're set to vote on the cap and trade
[10:54.560 --> 11:00.400]  they bring the bill out to the full floor and no one's allowed to read it I
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.800]  mean that's America is run by special interests that write the bills and then
[11:04.800 --> 11:11.360]  it's now extreme and bizarre and bad to want to read it and Obama gets up on
[11:11.360 --> 11:16.120]  TV and says just get out of my way get out of my way on health care I'm doing
[11:16.120 --> 11:31.240]  it and I have the bill here in front of me and we've gone over it and it is
[11:31.240 --> 11:36.800]  absolutely 180 degrees the opposite of this country and what this nation stands
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.480]  for and that's just a fact we're gonna go back over it again today when Bob
[11:41.480 --> 11:44.840]  Chapman's on with us because it deals with financial issues will deal with it
[11:44.840 --> 11:56.000]  for most that hour but and they engage in this hopes saying the economy is
[11:56.000 --> 11:59.760]  better and everything's fine when every economic indicator except for the stock
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.400]  market shows that we're in freefall with the real economy dying I mean I've
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.480]  never seen a case in the last hundred years looking at history and the news
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.240]  admits they've never heard of one either where dead bodies are stacking up at the
[12:13.240 --> 12:18.400]  morgues in every major town and city because people don't have money to bury
[12:18.400 --> 12:24.360]  their own families I mean we're going back to popper graves now that we haven't
[12:24.360 --> 12:30.040]  had in a hundred years the states and the counties are so bankrupt the bodies
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.640]  are stacked up whole rooms of dead bodies we can play the local newscast
[12:35.640 --> 12:48.520]  videos of this room stacked with corpses in body bags society unraveling we go
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.560]  live at prison planet dot TV will show people that image it's up on info wars
[12:52.560 --> 12:58.760]  dot com right now I mean is that an indicator of society collapsing whole
[12:58.760 --> 13:04.120]  neighborhoods in Michigan and Florida and California and Texas and where one
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.400]  out of five houses is occupied there's just for sales signs nobody the people
[13:08.400 --> 13:16.120]  have lost their homes that the homes are just rotting massive job layoffs
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.920]  intensifying and the media says the economy is great here's the headlines I
[13:21.920 --> 13:28.320]  got a whole stack on the town halls being taken over you are terrifying us
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.720]  voters in the message of Washington and get an ugly response this is out of the
[13:34.720 --> 13:39.920]  Wall Street Journal and the ugly responses the police come after you now
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.560]  they're saying where is a rule tonight I am saying no one is allowed to raise

[13:48.480 --> 13:57.480]  were drag you out yeah that's that's the American way and the media keeps saying
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.400]  it's so un-American to raise your voice no it's it's totally American it's a
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.680]  hundred and ten percent freedom and liberty to yell at these criminals that
[14:05.680 --> 14:08.960]  violate the bill rights and Constitution and do the opposite of what the people
[14:08.960 --> 14:14.600]  send them there to top Democrats denounce healthcare protest AP the
[14:14.600 --> 14:20.360]  Senate's most powerful Democrat scolded healthcare protesters dogging his

[14:23.920 --> 14:28.560]  political right have run out of ideas and ditch their civic manners majority
[14:28.560 --> 14:32.840]  leader Harry Reid of Nevada accused the protesters of trying to sabotage the
[14:32.840 --> 14:37.120]  democratic process see oh you're anti-democratic because you're

[24:29.320 --> 24:34.520]  media is acting like nobody is portraying it as if it's dirty and
[24:34.520 --> 24:39.320]  dangerous and bad that the American people don't want socialized federal
[24:39.320 --> 24:44.680]  controlled eugenics health care that the American people don't want to pay more
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.120]  for electricity and carbon taxes directly to Al Gore's company and the
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.560]  American people actually read the bills and found out there's anti-gun bills I
[24:53.560 --> 25:00.240]  mean the establishment is just really destroying themselves they don't
[25:00.240 --> 25:04.440]  understand that they can't talk to us like we're three-year-olds anymore and
[25:04.440 --> 25:10.600]  just tell us to sit down and shut up and that we're going to go along with it but
[25:10.600 --> 25:16.000]  the issue is this we need to have an article written an info wars dot com or
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.960]  present planet dot com by one of my writers showing all the YouTube videos
[25:19.960 --> 25:26.800]  of Republicans being moved off the stage and to explain that it is a bipartisan
[25:26.800 --> 25:37.320]  route and that these are completely organic spontaneous demonstrations I've
[25:37.320 --> 25:40.520]  talked to congressman I've talked to congressman's aides they say that
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.720]  citizens are coming to the house and Senate office buildings going through
[25:44.720 --> 25:49.600]  the metal detectors checking in going through all the hassle to go in and sit
[25:49.600 --> 25:54.160]  outside their offices now every day people that never did it before
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.560]  republican democrat it doesn't matter I mean how big of a story is this that not
[25:58.560 --> 26:02.280]  only is the media for months been just ignoring the fact that citizens are on
[26:02.280 --> 26:07.880]  the edge of revolt now they're acting like it's dirty and bad to go let your
[26:07.880 --> 26:15.520]  congress critters know what you think and that it's staged not spontaneous and
[26:15.520 --> 26:21.120]  that it's only Republicans that are protesting Democrats because as long as
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.640]  they can make it a left-right issue they win but if we can force into the
[26:25.640 --> 26:30.080]  mainstream media that government has an 11% approval rating Congress does and
[26:30.080 --> 26:36.440]  that people don't buy the propaganda anymore then that 30 40% of sheeple
[26:36.440 --> 26:42.120]  that won't wake up until they understand the majority is woken up we'll even have
[26:42.120 --> 26:50.000]  them awakening and coming off the reservation coming off the plantation I
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.120]  want to go ahead and start playing some of these audio clips here is
[26:56.120 --> 27:03.040]  congressman Conyers of Michigan in a press conference talking about how
[27:03.040 --> 27:07.800]  stupid it is to read the bills I mean this is like a alternate dimension of
[27:07.800 --> 27:16.760]  corruption special interest right them and he just totally capitulates to it
[27:16.760 --> 27:20.880]  and says what do you expect us to do read a thousand pages and have a lawyer
[27:20.880 --> 27:25.400]  there absolutely bill should be short and simple you know the media always
[27:25.400 --> 27:30.400]  frames it like what is congress doing the people want congress to get more
[27:30.400 --> 27:36.720]  done so they pass hundreds and hundreds of major bills a year each bill with in
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.760]  some cases thousands of pieces of legislation inside of it I mean the
[27:41.760 --> 27:47.400]  states are all passing laws to run our lives the taxes to control us to micro
[27:47.400 --> 27:52.600]  managers the founders said gridlock was good separation of powers three branches
[27:52.600 --> 27:56.480]  of government you don't want a bunch of people up there passing laws because
[27:56.480 --> 28:00.360]  they'll pass laws to steal your money or to shut down your business or to
[28:00.360 --> 28:07.480]  control your life here's John Conyers why would I read a health care bill that's
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.400]  the quote John Conyers that's the name of the video online it's up on info
[28:12.400 --> 28:20.920]  wars.com here it is I love these members that get up and say read the bill what
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.560]  good is reading the bill if it's a thousand pages and you don't have two
[28:26.560 --> 28:34.800]  days and two lawyers to find out what it means after you read the bill now you
[28:34.800 --> 28:38.920]  see that's their spirit and they know what they're doing it's desperation
[28:38.920 --> 28:43.600]  there's nothing you can do it's impossible exactly we don't need this
[28:43.600 --> 28:47.320]  health care bill how is it going to be administered even if government was good
[28:47.320 --> 28:50.800]  and weren't a bunch of murdering eugenicist how would it be administered by a
[28:50.800 --> 28:57.120]  government that can't read a thousand pages you can't read it but I read it
[28:57.120 --> 29:01.920]  you won't read it but I've gone over it we've written articles about it with the
[29:01.920 --> 29:06.000]  subsections I read the Patriot Act and wrote the original analysis of Patriot
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.240]  Act page one and two won the project censored award for it I mean I'm a guy
[29:10.240 --> 29:14.760]  with a wife and children I stayed up three nights it took me six hours but I
[29:14.760 --> 29:18.880]  scanned through it fast and read the sub areas and marked it up with with
[29:18.880 --> 29:23.160]  highlighter nobody else had done it I put it out people couldn't believe it top
[29:23.160 --> 29:26.920]  lawyers went and read it gave me credit and said mr. Jones is correct this is
[29:26.920 --> 29:31.880]  the absolute end of the Bill of Rights how come I can read it how come Ron Paul
[29:31.880 --> 29:35.760]  can read it now I'll be honest I didn't read the whole health care I scanned
[29:35.760 --> 29:40.560]  through and the key sections and read probably 200 pages of it I'd now read
[29:40.560 --> 29:50.000]  probably 800 pages of eco science no no these criminals have to be stopped

[33:30.240 --> 33:38.680]  you're on personal Jesus
[33:38.680 --> 33:43.480]  all right ladies and gentlemen this is getting serious huge development during
[33:43.480 --> 33:50.120]  the break this is outrageous I'm asking Kurt Nemo, Aaron Dykes, Steve Watson, Paul
[33:50.120 --> 33:56.920]  Watson everybody today and throughout the weekend to put all your attention on
[33:56.920 --> 34:02.120]  this because the country is on the edge of revolution I can officially tell you
[34:02.120 --> 34:06.680]  that Ron Paul agreed the congressman here two days ago that he's never seen
[34:06.680 --> 34:13.640]  anything approaching this and we are on the verge of flashpoint and I had him on
[34:13.640 --> 34:17.800]  a month before that he wasn't sure he said that we were rising that Liberty
[34:17.800 --> 34:23.080]  was rising but he didn't know now he says yes we had the momentum I also talked
[34:23.080 --> 34:28.280]  to him privately off air he was laughing he was incredibly happy you heard him
[34:28.280 --> 34:32.120]  laugh last week when he was on the show and you've never heard Ron Paul laughing
[34:32.120 --> 34:38.360]  because to see destiny happening to know that we can win this thing to know
[34:38.360 --> 34:41.200]  that we can bring down the private Federal Reserve in the New World Order
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.200]  and the Bank of the World is so exciting but the establishment realizes
[34:47.200 --> 34:52.240]  this is happening and they're going to stage a crisis you can bet your bottom
[34:52.240 --> 34:57.840]  dollar and quick I would say they may hit us next week in fact my spidey
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.600]  sense has never been in this much overdrive as it is right now I mean this
[35:02.600 --> 35:12.000]  is bad it's good the best of times worst of times as one great literary mind
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.320]  once said the best of times the worst of times because the people are waking up
[35:18.320 --> 35:23.320]  but the videos are pouring in so many that I can't even keep track of them
[35:23.320 --> 35:27.680]  during the breaks in the fourth hour today we're going to cover this issue and
[35:27.680 --> 35:33.360]  play a bunch of these videos at prisonplanet.tv but I need all my
[35:33.360 --> 35:36.920]  riders and everybody else out there if you've got an alternative news site we've
[35:36.920 --> 35:41.360]  got to take over the cyber space like we do on so many issues now and force this
[35:41.360 --> 35:46.400]  into the media we've already forced the fact that these aren't staged people
[35:46.400 --> 35:52.120]  standing up and saying no to Obamacare and cap and trade and other issues and
[35:52.120 --> 35:57.220]  Ron Paul at CPAC gets up in front of the most hardcore Republicans and says the
[35:57.220 --> 36:01.600]  war was bad the war is evil and gets a standing ovation with I would say at
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.320]  least 85% of the crowd just absolutely clapping see the Republicans don't want
[36:06.320 --> 36:11.840]  war either on every issue the American people are together 80 plus percent don't
[36:11.840 --> 36:20.760]  want war 91% don't want open borders 99% don't want banker bailout close to
[36:20.760 --> 36:26.480]  85% don't want the cap and trade depending on the poll it's 70 to 85
[36:26.480 --> 36:33.640]  there's a bunch of different numbers but the point is it's way past 70 we're all
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.920]  together and that goes for cops and FBI and school teachers and bureaucrats and
[36:38.920 --> 36:42.920]  it's not just in us against them I get threatened by the out of control police
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.600]  at a very primitive level and tend to lash out but that feeds into the
[36:46.600 --> 36:51.080]  globalist operation just like left-right paradigm does we've got to reach out to
[36:51.080 --> 36:58.000]  the military and police you know the FBI was here last week I've started yelling
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.040]  at them a little bit not not really meanly but like being very stern with
[37:01.040 --> 37:05.680]  them and very on the edge of yelling and then by the time they left they were
[37:05.680 --> 37:10.240]  really worried just you're giving me a subpoena I halfway apologized to them
[37:10.240 --> 37:14.760]  it's just at a primitive level I know FBI agents murdered Terrence Yankee cop of
[37:14.760 --> 37:18.000]  the year up in Oklahoma City for exposing it was a government inside job
[37:18.000 --> 37:23.520]  and I know they there's bad really evil units in the FBI that are very scary
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.880]  killers they recruit out of special forces but these guys weren't that you
[37:27.880 --> 37:33.680]  know the issue is that we've all got to keep our heads here why am I freaking out
[37:33.680 --> 37:41.520]  right now ladies and gentlemen I have seen multiple videos now and I realize
[37:41.520 --> 37:46.040]  that I saw one of these this morning and got caught looking at financial news and
[37:46.040 --> 37:50.720]  didn't even let this consciously register the magnitude of what I'm seeing I
[37:50.720 --> 37:58.480]  was just reading to you out of the st. Louis post dispatch six people including
[37:58.480 --> 38:06.760]  post dispatch reporter arrested at Carnahan meeting well guess what we now
[38:06.760 --> 38:13.840]  have the YouTube video shot by bystanders Union thugs with police assault
[38:13.840 --> 38:19.520]  innocent people and then arrest them this is the most hardcore mafia thuggish
[38:19.520 --> 38:24.840]  thuggism anti-American stuff I can imagine and I want to warn the thugs
[38:24.840 --> 38:29.640]  doing this and I want to warn the big-city machines your mafia has gone
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.320]  too far and it's gonna be just like when the Rockefellers had Pinkerton
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.920]  security people mow down protesters in the 20s and 30s and stuff this is gonna
[38:38.920 --> 38:47.480]  blow up in your face and these police and these union people need to be brought
[38:47.480 --> 38:52.160]  to justice you know the media calls it a fight and how this works is Union thugs
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.720]  attack you police attack you and then they charge you and so the headline is
[38:57.720 --> 39:05.280]  up on info wars calm union thugs beat patriot at
[39:05.280 --> 39:11.080]  Obamacare town hall in st. Louis the media tried to get photos of it so the

[39:16.440 --> 39:22.400]  can engage in the frame up I mean everything that tyranny's made of frame ups
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.480]  suppressing free speech and then the media the st. Louis post dispatch even
[39:27.480 --> 39:33.320]  though it's their own reporter going along with it and then framing the good
[39:33.320 --> 39:40.880]  people I mean this is just so sick but you know what YouTube's there and we
[39:40.880 --> 39:43.600]  know they're trying to shut it down and moved to mainly Hollywood movies and
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.200]  TV and YouTube admits they're moving towards shutting down free speech so we
[39:47.200 --> 39:51.080]  got the other video servers that's why the establishment and senator Rockefeller
[39:51.080 --> 39:54.800]  saying they want to shut down the general public being able to upload we

[40:54.020 --> 40:57.600]  side while I was talking to him that worked for him he acts friendly while
[40:57.600 --> 41:02.200]  their thugs go at you and they want to make all of America like Chicago and

[41:10.520 --> 41:15.280]  will to train us to be domesticated the ever-to-discredit and shut down
[41:15.280 --> 41:19.280]  opposition to Obamacare has gone from Senate majority leader Harry Reid's
[41:19.280 --> 41:26.040]  holding up artificial turf and House majority Nancy Pelosi calling opponents
[41:26.040 --> 41:31.120]  Nazis to violence during the demonstration Thursday evening outside a
[41:31.120 --> 41:38.920]  forum of aging called U.S. Representative Russ Carnahan of St. Louis a
[41:38.920 --> 41:46.080]  Democrat in Missouri a patriot was viciously attacked by union thugs
[41:46.080 --> 41:52.080]  healthcare reform opponents felt cheated after being locked out of the town
[41:52.080 --> 41:57.400]  hall writes Ryan Witt of the examiner yeah they have these stage town halls
[41:57.400 --> 42:00.720]  now and they kick anybody out that doesn't agree and then and then get on
[42:00.720 --> 42:05.600]  the news and say look everybody agrees some believe that the SEI use service
[42:05.600 --> 42:12.160]  employees international union members were being let in instead of them from
[42:12.160 --> 42:18.440]  my personal observation at the office was allowing people who had RSVP'd
[42:18.440 --> 42:23.320]  beforehand to go in ahead of others yeah that's how it works they claim their
[42:23.320 --> 42:29.600]  town halls but they only mail them out to union members or to Democrats and now
[42:29.600 --> 42:33.440]  they're having smaller stage town halls were only their employees are there and
[42:33.440 --> 42:38.760]  they call them citizens the Democrat Carnahan packed the event intended to
[42:38.760 --> 42:43.840]  prevent the opposition from attending as the video below shows acorn activists
[42:43.840 --> 42:48.840]  also received preferential treatment at the stage managed event it's all on
[42:48.840 --> 42:54.520]  video the st. Louis post dispatch reports people opposed Obamacare were kept out
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.080]  because of the turnout an assertion at odds with the above video the back and
[42:59.080 --> 43:02.680]  forth between factions within the crowd created a carnival like atmosphere yeah
[43:02.680 --> 43:07.080]  they wasn't full inside and outside between the members of the movement
[43:07.080 --> 43:12.640]  opposing president Obama's policies and the groups who came to show support for
[43:12.640 --> 43:16.900]  the president's proposal in a prepared statement after the event the
[43:16.900 --> 43:21.120]  congressman characterized the opposition as disruptors and said that they had
[43:21.120 --> 43:24.680]  mobilized by special interest in Washington who have lined their pockets
[43:24.680 --> 43:28.480]  by overcharging Americans or broken health care system yeah I'm getting
[43:28.480 --> 43:32.920]  hundreds of emails and calls and post on info wars in prison planet calm you

[44:01.840 --> 44:04.760]  demonstrating against Democrats attempting to force Obamacare through
[44:04.760 --> 44:09.680]  Congress as the video below documents the disruptors were pro Obamacare
[44:09.680 --> 44:16.080]  supporters not the anti Obamacare people and it goes on Kenneth was attacked
[44:16.080 --> 44:20.280]  on the evening of August 6th by representative Russ Carnahan's town
[44:20.280 --> 44:26.760]  hall meeting in south st. Louis County writes his attorney David B Brown and

[45:13.040 --> 45:18.760]  everybody's welcome to fight the New World Order the se IU member used a
[45:18.760 --> 45:23.480]  racial slur against Kenneth oh of course because liberals remember a real
[45:23.480 --> 45:26.480]  Nazi comes up with a ponytail and Birkenstocks I'm not saying everybody

[45:41.240 --> 45:45.040]  racial slur against Kenneth didn't punch him in the face and it fell to the
[45:45.040 --> 45:48.680]  ground another se IU member yelled racial epithets to Kenneth as he kicked
[45:48.680 --> 45:53.960]  him in the head and back Kenneth was also brutally attacked by one male se IU
[45:53.960 --> 46:00.200]  member and an unidentified woman the three men were clearly se IU members
[46:00.200 --> 46:05.160]  and that we're wearing t-shirts with the se IU logo and then it goes on how the
[46:05.160 --> 46:08.800]  police then responded and rest of the reporter to shut it down but not before
[46:08.800 --> 46:14.200]  video of it was circulated away just like when the cops shoots that poor guy on
[46:14.200 --> 46:20.320]  the dart platform in the back at the dart train station and they go grab
[46:20.320 --> 46:23.160]  everybody's cameras on camera but they didn't know somebody was in a train
[46:23.160 --> 46:27.000]  stopped videoing it then they said they lost all the tapes we're gonna defeat

[46:42.000 --> 46:46.960]  to justice Kenneth supporters conservatives ideals although he
[46:46.960 --> 46:51.160]  subscribes to no particular political party brown continues we're calling on
[46:51.160 --> 46:54.760]  se IU representatives and the congressman president Obama to condemn the
[46:54.760 --> 46:58.760]  racist actions of these union thugs and it goes on from there I want the lawyer
[46:58.760 --> 47:02.040]  on see I just started reading the article I was watching the clip here in the
[47:02.040 --> 47:08.560]  break we have the original email from Kurt Nemo so I want that lawyer on fourth

[47:19.880 --> 47:26.760]  crazy union people and the police can't stand for that and so they go after them
[47:26.760 --> 47:32.160]  and they go after them in a big way and then frame them and arrest them so in
[47:32.160 --> 47:36.960]  America you get beat up by political thugs and then you go to jail for it and
[47:36.960 --> 47:41.560]  then the cops age you in the cover-up now by the way we have out of st. Louis the
[47:41.560 --> 47:46.680]  newscast with the district attorney and the sheriff in the county next to him

[48:01.000 --> 48:04.600]  people would love to turn us into the complete Soviet Union because then they
[48:04.600 --> 48:08.200]  get to move into your houses take your farms take your ranches they're doing
[48:08.200 --> 48:11.600]  it all with the animal ID premises how do you look what happened in Germany and

[48:21.120 --> 48:25.520]  further than anybody ever has but seven months in he is stalling up to his axels
[48:25.520 --> 48:29.640]  and so they are gonna get aggressive they're gonna try to intimidate us and

[48:51.440 --> 48:55.520]  terror attacks so you can suck your thumbs and ban free speech and try to

[50:25.320 --> 50:30.360]  hold or it's over they are going to stage events there is no doubt the
[50:30.360 --> 50:34.680]  revolution is starting in the United States peacefully of people shattering

[55:14.960 --> 55:21.520]  the beginning and the enemy is acting like a dictator like Mike Rivera likes
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.280]  to say the quickest way to bring down a dictator is making Mac like one this
[55:26.280 --> 55:31.360]  beaten men and women up and punching them in the nose because they dare protest
[55:31.360 --> 55:34.200]  on a street corner and the cops all over the country come up and say you're not
[55:34.200 --> 55:37.600]  allowed to protest but then if you're pro government you can they said we got
[55:37.600 --> 55:41.880]  to have a permit permit started in the last 50 years if you wanted to have a
[55:41.880 --> 55:47.920]  Macy's Day parade and block the road but then they tried to say oh you can't
[55:47.920 --> 55:51.080]  even have a sandwich bore on the corner without a permit it's all a first
[55:51.080 --> 55:54.760]  amendment violation it's a load of bull and I don't care if you're black

[56:13.160 --> 56:20.880]  American people it's still not too late all we're asking you to do is that when
[56:20.880 --> 56:24.960]  Union fugs punch some innocent person in the nose you don't have to arrest the
[56:24.960 --> 56:29.000]  person that got punched in the nose you can arrest the Union person but you were
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.440]  told to help them weren't you because in St. Louis and surrounding areas it's
[56:34.440 --> 56:42.080]  run by the Chicago mob everybody knows it and so now the cops are reduced to

[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.320]  to make this a partisan issue if it comes out that it's both parties that
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:19.240]  people hate and that the system across the board is doing the opposite of what
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:23.480]  the people want and what's constitutional then all support for these

[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:16.240]  powerful by extension through Obama or you feel like you're powerful through

[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:39.040]  Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us for the balance of the hour to talk about the
[1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:44.160]  NAU meeting on Mexico that nobody's talking about but he's covering I'd
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:47.000]  mentioned a few weeks ago but it had kind of forgotten about it we're gonna
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.680]  talk about how they're beating up people with the police that are now against
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:54.480]  Obamacare on video and then arresting those they beat up we got the lawyer
[1:11:54.480 --> 1:11:58.440]  coming on later one of our listeners they contacted us we have the video this
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:01.280]  is happening everywhere and he's gonna cover of course the birth certificate
[1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:04.920]  what he really thinks is going on there Dr. Corsi it's great having you on with
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:11.840]  us Alex it's great to be back thank you you bet out of the gates let's get into
[1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:17.720]  what's happening with demonstrations everywhere truly spontaneous I've had
[1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:21.680]  neighbors and friends that went to him with the Lloyd dogged last weekend at
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.280]  the Randall's grocery store I didn't even know about it till I saw the video that
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:29.160]  talked to my neighbor talked to one of my dad's employees who was there the most
[1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:33.760]  of these are Democrats because he only sent letters out to them they're mad and
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:38.240]  the media is trying to spin it saying it's staged what do you make of this
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.600]  well first of all the the people who are showing up at the town hall meetings
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:47.240]  are average Americans their middle-class Americans who are upset
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:51.960]  predominantly about the health care they're very concerned that the takeover
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:57.840]  of the health care system is going to give them poorer health care cost more
[1:12:57.840 --> 1:13:02.320]  taxes and the seniors are very concerned it's going to end up being rationing of
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:05.720]  health care to senior all that you'll said that in his book it's in the bill
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:09.960]  and this is nothing but eugenics I mean even Fox News has said it's eugenics the
[1:13:09.960 --> 1:13:13.880]  doctor they had on I mean I mean this is the government running your health care
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:17.760]  I can't think of anything worse with these control freaks well I don't think
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:21.560]  people want a 28-year-old bureaucrat making decisions on what health care
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:26.880]  they get especially seniors that it's the history of countries that have had
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:31.040]  government-run health care is that health care is going to be rationed and
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:36.640]  it's been pretty clearly stated I think in the whole intention of this bill that
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:40.080]  there's no way people can be provided this universal health care unless there
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:46.080]  is rationing Obama said it now to get back to the issue what we're finding in
[1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:50.960]  World of Daily and I'm continuing to get emails through the day various S. E. I.
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:57.160]  you union employee attending these rallies I guess a series of rallies
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:14:01.960]  last night were attended and the S. E. I. you attendees appeared to be the ones
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:06.000]  causing the disruption in the protest they were the ones pushing and shoving
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:11.080]  and shouting and screaming in fact there's one video I've been got I've
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:16.840]  gotten the chose one of the S. E. I. you anti protesters being arrested by the
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:21.800]  police for disrupting out causing disruption on the scene so there's
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:25.720]  pushback here from the White House also Paul
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:30.520]  recruitment article of the New York Times today which I thought was
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:35.680]  particularly offensive to the protesters saying that this was just white
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:42.360]  angry racist the redneck republicans no no my listener is black his lawyers
[1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:46.680]  contacted us there's video they run up and beat him and say how can an in-
[1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:51.440]  word be at a meeting against Obama and punch him in the nose in fact I've seen
[1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:55.320]  that video on the internet that's now playing on the internet yeah we have it
[1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:00.600]  on info wars.com go ahead okay and so you know the if the White House is
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:05.600]  taking the position that any and this is what I wrote an abomination it's been
[1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:11.200]  going on to be in the campaign anyone who politically objects to a position
[1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:16.400]  taken by President Obama or candidate Obama is by definition called a racist
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:21.960]  by their supporter so and now with the White House putting up this feed you
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:27.000]  know the site to turn your neighbors in report people who don't agree with
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:32.240]  President Obama this flag at White House dot gov and President Obama had a
[1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:38.120]  press a clear opportunity he could have said to Nancy Pelosi quit demonizing the
[1:15:38.120 --> 1:15:43.440]  town hall protesters by saying people showing up with signs and swastikas
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:50.760]  portraying them as if this is a right-wing organized effort to object to
[1:15:50.760 --> 1:16:00.240]  Obama by a small group it's not the case this is a very broad-based reaction
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:05.040]  and if you take a look honestly at the numbers the president poll numbers are
[1:16:05.040 --> 1:16:11.480]  plummeting he's now down to about 50% and those are lower in some polls love
[1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:15.960]  seem as low as 45 and some of your right Rasmussen and the Gallup he's at 50
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:21.680]  the Quinney impact University just came out they are about 50% that was this
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:28.280]  week I think that was reported yesterday by Fox and the dropping which is
[1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:33.160]  dramatic I mean the approval rating was about 63% President Obama was
[1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:37.680]  inaugurated in January now this is a this is a more precipitous drop than
[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:43.400]  even Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter was in the August before he hit under 60 and
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:48.800]  now President Obama is risking getting under 50 in August of his first year in
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:55.200]  office this is dramatic polarizing and President Obama is ending up being not
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:16:59.440]  the uniting president he came on saying he was going to be but probably one of
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:04.360]  the most divisive presidents we've ever had and I think the attempt by the White
[1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:11.040]  House to demonize those middle-class Americans who show up at town hall
[1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:15.920]  meetings to express their grievances with a health care plan if they're going
[1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:20.160]  to be demonized by the White House I'm wondering why President Obama's numbers
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:26.720]  are as high as 50 because they're going to drop by the way at prison planet dot
[1:17:26.720 --> 1:17:33.000]  TV I'm playing the video of a black man being attacked for being against the
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.520]  health care this is the democracy of Obama and let's remember it was st.
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:42.000]  Louis where they had the prosecutors and the sheriff in the county announced on
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:46.760]  TV themselves that they would arrest people that they deemed were being
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:50.480]  dishonest about Obama that of course would be a civil matter if Obama thinks
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:53.760]  you're lying about him he has to sue you but no the police said they'd be judged
[1:17:53.760 --> 1:17:59.360]  jury and executioner and this is shocking video of the of the union thugs
[1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:03.560]  attacking people what's even more shocking is then the police arrest one
[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:10.440]  of the reporters who is covering it and it appears to then persecute some of the
[1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:15.160]  people that are being attacked dr. Corsi well the irony here is that you know
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:20.960]  President Obama is supposed to be the he's portray himself as the community
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:26.580]  organizer in chief I mean other films about him that you know films but
[1:18:26.580 --> 1:18:31.480]  churning into office all the stories about his community organizing efforts
[1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:37.440]  in Chicago up and then now while Obama was working in all of all of the
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:41.760]  organization which is about his radical to the left socialist organization as
[1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:48.160]  you could get his rules for radicals is is dedicated to Lucifer correct it's
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:52.800]  dedicated to Lucifer with all of the calls the first radical and among the
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:57.440]  rules you know basically the advice from all this key is cut your hair put on a
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:01.720]  business suit act like you're going to be a moderate get elected and then when
[1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:06.000]  you get elected break all your campaign promises because you only said those on
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:11.920]  a mackey valley in principle that people believe what seems to be the case so
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:16.080]  seemed to be moderate then when you get into office redistribute wealth and put
[1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:19.320]  central government control over the economy and as I wrote in the
[1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:24.640]  abomination that's how Obama was trained now that community organizing or
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:30.080]  acorn or fdi you of the Obama administration which is extremely far
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:35.920]  left that's all fine but a middle american speak up at town hall meeting
[1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:39.960]  then they've got to be demonized by the White House as if they were no right
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:46.600]  wing organized red deck not see thought which is ridiculous well they also mix
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:51.080]  the term not see him with redneck rule and why is it being redneck or whites a
[1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:52.240]  bad thing
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:58.760]  they're making all these terms together to demonize middle american who just
[1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:02.840]  got a break doctor stay with us did you know that there are tiny hidden radio

[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:06.720]  new world orders war against humanity but rock Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:21:06.720 --> 1:21:11.480]  and we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:15.840]  think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:19.840]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:24.480]  Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one of this election if you have a
[1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:28.640]  demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is
[1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:33.560]  imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance older
[1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:39.840]  bucks that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:46.040]  government this film documents who Obama works for the lies he is told and his

[1:21:57.160 --> 1:22:02.440]  the people strike back hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:05.800]  familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:09.600]  spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:13.160]  some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can
[1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:16.800]  remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small
[1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:20.480]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit
[1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:23.880]  spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure
[1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:28.120]  deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:32.040]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[1:22:32.040 --> 1:22:35.840]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:39.320]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve the strength and
[1:22:39.320 --> 1:22:43.680]  stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly
[1:22:43.680 --> 1:22:47.800]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been

[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:11.280]  do it but it's not just our listeners it's everybody across the board Dr.
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:16.200]  Corsi continuing how is the establishment gonna counter this I mean you
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:20.240]  think Obama will stage a crisis or something I don't see any other way he
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:24.040]  is falling faster than any other president he's lower than Bush was at
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:28.200]  this time lower than Jimmy Carter the bigger they are the harder they fall
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:33.600]  the hoax that is Obama is deflating monstrously fast what do you see them
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:37.440]  doing well they're gonna have but what he's gonna do immediately is on Sunday
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:42.200]  he's headed to Mexico we've got the another meeting which should be the
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:46.320]  security and prosperity partnership meeting if they've renamed these
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:51.320]  meetings now Alex as you know they're calling it the North American leaders
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:56.440]  summit as I reported on WorldNet Daily and also my red alert newsletter I've
[1:25:56.440 --> 1:26:01.440]  got articles saying that there's a plan that has been advanced by several of the
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:06.840]  think tanks saying of the attention that we've brought your show is brought
[1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:12.000]  others abroad on the security and prosperity partnership is you know the
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:17.600]  North American Union agenda that the exposure has hurt the integration
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:21.680]  efforts so they really changed the name North American leaders summit they've
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:25.680]  downgraded the meeting it's no longer security and prosperity partnership if
[1:26:25.680 --> 1:26:31.760]  you look at the website spp.gov they've got a notice on the website that they're
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.200]  in the process of reformatting the site so they can do a public relations make
[1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:39.960]  over the Department of Commerce the security and prosperity partnership
[1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:44.680]  website well dr. Corsi let me ask you this all into the radar all of the
[1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:48.600]  radar that's the I mean that's my point all on the radar this seems like to be
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:52.240]  one of their only tricks they got five or six tricks they do me you can count them
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:57.360]  on both hands they always I mean take take the North American super highways
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:02.080]  the trans-Texas corridors the nap the super highways first they announced it
[1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:05.000]  ten years ago and said it was great people said they didn't want it they
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:09.600]  said it didn't exist didn't they change the name again then they said they
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:12.400]  canceled the program but in the same article announced they were just
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:18.480]  renaming it I mean SPP is now going to change their name this is just
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:22.720]  incredible I mean people are seeing through this what is running out of
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:27.240]  press release now because there's only thing coming out about this meeting in
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:31.200]  the last hour before the meeting happened I mean I can't see anything on
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:35.640]  television or any announcements really for the White House that this is a big
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:40.440]  deal meeting it's very low-key but on the agenda is that the Mexican trucks are
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:44.840]  going to come back into the United States I've reported on this in red alert
[1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:49.560]  that a world that's daily no one seems to be you're covering it Alex but very few
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:54.140]  are that they're going to be reintroduced legislation
[1:27:54.140 --> 1:27:59.480]  Transpiratory Secretary Ray LaHood has now gotten it through all the internal
[1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:04.760]  Obama administration department and as you recall the money was taken out of
[1:28:04.760 --> 1:28:09.320]  the Department of Transportation to Democrats it was North Dakota Senator
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:18.280]  Byron Dorgan and also Peter DeFazio was a he was in the house leaving the
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:22.560]  effort to take out the money but the Department of Transportation budget to
[1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:27.240]  discontinue the Bush administration Mexican truck demonstration project now
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:31.960]  the legislation is going to say they have new rules and suddenly the Mexican
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:36.320]  trucks are going to be safe under the US commercial vehicle safety alliance
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:41.960]  standards which is a joke Mexican trucks don't meet standards with breaks or with
[1:28:41.960 --> 1:28:49.080]  equipment in other capacities they don't meet hours or time on the road regardless
[1:28:49.080 --> 1:28:51.720]  Dr. as you know you've been to many of these events and covered them and
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:55.840]  written a best-selling book about it like right USA it's on even if they did a
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:00.240]  great job which they're not it's it's unconstitutional it's criminal to take
[1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:04.440]  our liberty our freedom our sovereignty and give it to these unelected boards
[1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:08.800]  Reuters is reporting on it but they're acting like it's just an anti-drug
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:14.120]  summit which is what pasture your arch enemy our arch enemy your nemesis wrote
[1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:20.560]  about in this plan how they would use crises drug war flu and economic
[1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:26.200]  collapse to bring this in and the Reuters has put the drug issue right at
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:30.760]  the top of their press release Mexico's drug war what this is evidently being
[1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:35.400]  filled is being about but it's again it should be the I believe the fifth
[1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:39.440]  meeting of the security and prosperity partnership annual summit amazing tell
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:42.600]  us more about it you're the expert on this when we get back with Dr. Ram
[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:46.720]  Corsi then we'll get into the latest birther issue Dr. Corsi's been doing
[1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:53.480]  in-depth research with the state of Hawaii we're on the March the Empires on

[1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:21.160]  American administrative rules as a prelude to a European Union style
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:25.760]  government even new currency like the Amaro now also I think the recession
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:31.480]  which is a a failure of the global economy and it's gonna have a very hard
[1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:36.040]  time recovering because so many structural unemployment has created so many
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:41.040]  jobs in the middle class they're simply gone manufacturing jobs that are not
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:44.800]  going to return because the multi-national corporations have
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:48.280]  found slaves somewhere in the world that could do those jobs cheaper than
[1:36:48.280 --> 1:36:55.360]  Americans now when you put all this together the agenda among the globalist
[1:36:55.360 --> 1:37:00.960]  is still advancing and Obama is clearly a globalist remember Alexey campaign
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:06.360]  President Obama when he's campaigning at Pennsylvania and Ohio Michigan said he
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:11.880]  was going to renegotiate NAFTA even fired Austin Gould be his economic
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:16.280]  advisor during the campaign went to Canada and said wink wink that's just a
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:21.600]  campaign problem well Austin Gould be back in the White House he's hired he's
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:24.480]  part of the administration with the Council of Economic Advisers that it
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:30.160]  was always wink wink President Obama very quietly on Sunday now probably the
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:34.800]  least newsworthy day at the week it's gonna go to Mexico and have this big
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:39.560]  summit why doesn't he do it on a Tuesday or Wednesday when I was about to say I
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:42.400]  was about to say that of course he usually they act like it's the second
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:46.600]  coming of Christ when you know he even goes for a hamburger to play golf or
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:50.880]  especially to a foreign country but there's almost no coverage of this one
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:56.280]  Reuters article some of the stories you've written this radio show that is
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:59.560]  you're really a big indicator of what's going on here but just going back to the
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:04.280]  psychology of Obama how he said he was going to end NAFTA and Gad and now he's
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:08.360]  fighting to reauthorize it how he said he wouldn't push any gun bills and all
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:11.920]  we've done is introduce him how he said he wouldn't hire one lobbyist and now
[1:38:11.920 --> 1:38:16.200]  he's hired nothing but lobbyists more liberal rules on lobbyist writing bills
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:21.040]  and Bush had secrecy about who visits the White House a new level of Cheney
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:27.960]  level secrecy I mean lying about the Patriot Act saying lying about
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:33.920]  warrantless wiretapping I mean this guy is just he makes Bill Clinton look honest
[1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:40.320]  well and he's not ruling from the center as Bill Clinton did this is a this was
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:46.320]  my central argument the abomination this is a far leftist idea law who was
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:51.360]  raised in a Saul Alinsky environment read his own dreams for my father he
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:56.440]  says it's intellectual off-former of years were reading Malcolm X
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:02.720]  Oakley Carmichael black power friends and on because you know the African
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:07.880]  anti-colonial writer who was a socialist revolutionary and this is where
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:12.160]  Barack Obama comes from and I imagine that he was going to keep any of these
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:17.360]  campaign promises only people who never read Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:21.720]  would imagine that Obama was meant anything he was promising during his
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:27.440]  campaign he was saying all of the right thing so people would say oh they'll
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:32.600]  just be another moderate Democrat will rule from the center when that couldn't
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:36.840]  have been less true but Dr. Corsi isn't it more than that and isn't that just his
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:41.560]  left cover and I understand he came from that poverty pimp foundation system the
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:49.240]  foundations create that fake organic you know liberal MO to pimp out and control
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:54.400]  their local slaves and to use them as political weapons to menace the middle
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:59.320]  class and to submission in the major urban centers I mean isn't Obama getting
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:05.840]  four times the money of John McCain just a total corporate slick-tongued Harvard
[1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:09.760]  lawyer I mean I know you're from Harvard too but I'm bashing Harvard the point is
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:14.800]  isn't he just a just a corporate shill I mean you think he really is a communist
[1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:20.160]  his top advisors come from Wall Street for Barack Obama it look at the list
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:23.440]  you've got Goldman Sachs you've got many of the banks even that we're involved
[1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:28.680]  in the bailout you've got lawyers from you know top law firms in Washington and
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:34.720]  York Barack Obama drew money just like John McCain did they both did from
[1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:41.120]  virtually the same Wall Street banker lawyer group George Soros also funded
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:46.520]  John McCain I wrote that out of the document of that going back into a
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:50.000]  world that they live before the campaign sure so they own both fighters in the
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:55.920]  fight no matter what one Wall Street and Soros and one the globalist one what
[1:40:55.920 --> 1:41:01.480]  you're saying at his core he is a he's elected to the socialist and in core
[1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:06.880]  that's what I've always argued he and when you when he gets the opportunity to
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.960]  rule the way he wants to rule you forget all the campaign promises now it's full
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:17.160]  steam ahead with the Mexican trucks they come across the border he flies down to
[1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:22.480]  Mexico on a stealth agenda on Sunday to hold what should be a security and
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:26.480]  prosperity partnership meeting they haven't taken the website down yet
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:30.800]  fbp.gov in the Department of Commerce but they're announcing they're redoing
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:36.520]  at a complete public relations makeover but that's what I'm saying is that he's
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:40.640]  got goons everywhere beating people up the reports are confirmed out of Missouri
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:46.120]  New York California Texas I mean he really does want an army of obama
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:51.880]  noids out there knocking people in the head this guy I mean I know you and
[1:41:51.880 --> 1:41:56.840]  Webster Tarble me another said he would do this yeah but to actually see brown
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:01.720]  shirts in America to actually see them running around beating everybody up and
[1:42:01.720 --> 1:42:06.200]  police on the news saying don't talk bad about Obama or will arrest you do you
[1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:09.400]  ever feel like you're gonna wake up in a twilight zone or outer limits episode
[1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:13.680]  dr. sometimes it does feel bad but you know I I said that the community
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:18.520]  organizers and you've got to realize Alex I've been dealing with the leftist
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:23.760]  community organizers back to the 1960s for me this is four decades of fighting
[1:42:23.760 --> 1:42:28.280]  this issue but now they're not the headpiece of the street so so now they're
[1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:32.520]  not the headpiece out the street they're now the police they grew up they put on
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:37.120]  business suit they got into the power establishment and it's okay now for them
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:42.720]  to take billions of taxpayer money and give it to acorn billions and make sure
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:47.760]  that they can still community organized from the far left but if anybody
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:52.200]  including ordinary citizens grandparents show up at these meetings not
[1:42:52.200 --> 1:42:58.280]  organized not paid for not professional agitators then what happened is the
[1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:04.200]  Obama people demonize these senior citizens and others attending the
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:09.880]  town hall meetings and they sent out the seiu and other left-funded community
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:14.480]  organizing groups or unions or Obama supporters of one guy to another to
[1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:20.360]  harass beat up and cause trouble disrupt the ability of ordinary middle
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:24.760]  Americans middle American middle class Americans to go to these town halls and
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:30.400]  express the grievance if that's what the left has always done the left is the
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:37.000]  Obama far left community organizer is not about free speech it's a Chicago big
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:46.200]  city machine enforcer yes and with the background of a socialist ideology that
[1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:51.000]  if you do not agree with your bite definition enemy of the state well
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  that's what they were saying is they ran up to this black guy on video and said
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  how can a black guy be against Obama and then called him the n-word and punched
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.920]  him in the nose well that's the thing I mean they the whole issue is the the
[1:44:04.920 --> 1:44:10.200]  race you know you've read Paul Krugman today in the New York Times so the the
[1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:13.160]  middle-class people attending these town hall meetings are defined by Paul
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:18.160]  Krugman is racist anybody who objects to Barack Obama is racist but yet if you
[1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:23.200]  know you want to advance that argument the expectation from the left is that
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:27.120]  they're going to get 100% of the African-American folks and any African
[1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:31.560]  American who dares be conservative and object to Barack Obama is going to get
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:36.840]  doubly demonized by the left well you know I was reading the post dispatch in
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:39.760]  other articles that made a slight mistake they did arrest a reporter who
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:42.840]  didn't deserve to be arrested and they did arrest some of the people who were
[1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:48.720]  against against what Obama is doing with health care but they also did
[1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:53.560]  arrest one of the people that did assault the innocent tea party person so
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:58.800]  the police did appear to a better job so so so good for them the police are
[1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:02.080]  usually I mean my experience with the police in America is the police are
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:07.000]  doing their best to try to preserve order the police are trying to maintain a
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:13.480]  peaceful situation so the video is I saw even with the FBI protesters causing
[1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:17.560]  trouble at a couple of these rallies over the last couple of days the police
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:20.400]  have done everything they can just to quiet things down there to be even
[1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:25.240]  handed but the police are being put into an untenable situation if all the
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:30.560]  far left is going to call out its dog to try to disrupt these meetings so that
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:34.720]  they appear to have been disruptive from the beginning they're not these are
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:38.440]  angry people that's why they're doing that that's right in fact the news or
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:42.640]  when I read the Pits Pitsburg post dispatch their own reporter got arrested
[1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:48.640]  for no reason and then the post acted like that was a good thing and the post
[1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:54.760]  is is just incredible I mean it's incredible how they distort and and
[1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:58.600]  meanwhile I'm sure you've seen all the articles we have a CNN piece they're
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:04.920]  saying the Obama Joker pitcher is racist when all it's showing is a psychopathic
[1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:10.200]  lying criminal and the very magazine that showed George Bush as a vampire well
[1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:13.920]  they did they did a Joker picture of George W. Bush too and no one in the
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:18.160]  left objected to that but I can recall but I mean is Obama a god like Hitler
[1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:22.240]  or Stalin where you can't make fun of him because the Democrats are in the
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:26.680]  news calling it dangerous calling it illegal saying it should be taken down
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:31.040]  calling it group this is the totalitarianism of the political left
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:38.600]  it's been this way since 1917 it's been this way since the 1960 when you were
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:44.640]  dealing with SDS leftist radicals like Bill Ayers they never have tolerated on
[1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:49.160]  the far left free speech if you object to the left you are by definition a
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:54.040]  racist an imperialist a colonialist it give all the other name you can't have a
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:59.000]  position that is tolerated by the left unless you agree with them listen I've
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:02.320]  had the anarchist not all of them you know the certain groups that are hired
[1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:07.120]  by big foundations they'll just come over and you could be talking about you
[1:47:07.120 --> 1:47:10.680]  could be talking about you know the sky being blue and they'll just start
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:15.680]  poking you calling you a racist and it's a religion to them and they smile they
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:19.680]  know you're not a racist they're just using it as their big foundation weapon
[1:47:19.680 --> 1:47:24.720]  well I mean take Nancy Pelosi saying you're astroturf racist if you're
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:28.800]  against health care you're a racist I mean it really is comical it's like a
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:33.280]  bunch of parrots was chirping the same word it seemed like Nancy Pelosi took her
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:38.960]  talking points right off of a daily cause column and posting I'm looking for the
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:42.880]  swastika pictures I don't see swastika people coming in with swastika
[1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:49.440]  picture this is not a far-right protest it's a middle American protest and from
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:55.720]  the left the left tactic has always been when there's getting a strong uprising
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:48:00.200]  from middle America against them they'll try to make middle America appear as if
[1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:03.960]  middle America is violent so the attempt has been to get these of these
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:09.280]  events to be portrayed as not just angry expressions of opinion but
[1:48:09.280 --> 1:48:14.400]  intentionally created disruptive violent protests from the organized
[1:48:14.400 --> 1:48:18.480]  radical right which could not be farther from the truth I mean the
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:22.600]  Republican Party right now is so disorganized I don't know the Republican
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:27.800]  Party could organize a Sunday afternoon picnic the idea that the Republican
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:32.400]  Party is driving these protests is not the case at all many of these people who
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:36.320]  are showing up at these rallies are just as angry at the Republican Party of
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:41.480]  George Bush as they are the Democratic Party of Barack Obama well I just you
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:45.440]  know Dr. Corsi I just can't believe that I pick up the same was post a
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:51.440]  dispatch and it says that anti-Obama health care people cause a disturbance
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:57.600]  and then you watch the videos and it's the Obama people attacking them the
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:02.000]  likelihood is that the peaceful middle American who are at these meetings are
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:05.560]  going to be blamed for the violence whether they cause it or not and the
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:11.600]  left knowing that just wants to have these events disrupted so the images
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:16.520]  created that this is a violent reaction against President Obama which it's not
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:21.320]  even if that has to be generated or concocted and that's where you know I'm
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:25.600]  concerned to see now the White House instead of taking the position of
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:31.320]  defending the right of middle Americans to speak out of coaching the senators
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:37.040]  and having meetings at Axelrod and the deputy chief of staff at the White
[1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:42.280]  House get talking points to the senators going home saying if you get
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:45.440]  punched back at these punch out of these meetings we'll punch back twice as
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:51.840]  hard these are aggressive far-left techniques that don't bear with free
[1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:56.120]  speech the White House ought to be out there saying we're listening instead of
[1:49:56.120 --> 1:50:01.240]  you know instead instead he's saying get out of my way here's president here is
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:06.120]  president Barack Obama here's the video and audio so we've got some work to
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:12.160]  do I don't mind by the way being responsible I expect to be held
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:26.200]  responsible for these issues because I'm the president but I don't want the
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:31.920]  folks who created the mess I don't want the folks created the mess do a lot of
[1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:35.120]  talking I want them just to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess we
[1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:40.720]  did not come this far but we're gonna talk about this when we get back final
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:48.480]  segment with Dr. Jerome Corsi you notice here that he says anybody that
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:53.120]  opposes him created the mess so he sounds more like Al Sharpton and pretty
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:57.120]  good start sounding like rubber right if he's going to play it well but you
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:51:00.320]  notice he's saying I don't want to hear talk from you he says I don't want to hear
[1:51:00.320 --> 1:51:03.920]  your speech this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about graph under safe

[1:54:07.680 --> 1:54:11.400]  created the mess do a lot of talking I want them just to get out of the way so
[1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:16.440]  we can clean up the mess we did not come this far by by by lowering our sights
[1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:21.160]  or we're scaling back our dreams that's not the American way it's not about
[1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:24.520]  looking backwards it's about looking for you know we haven't even gotten into the
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:33.680]  whole birther issue or Iran with Jerome Corsi Dr. Jerome Corsi but it's
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:37.680]  outrageous to hear him say that anybody that opposes anything he's doing we all
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:41.440]  cause the mess see that's why the democrats need the republicans and the
[1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:44.960]  republicans need the democrats to always blame what's happening on the other
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:50.720]  party when they're all in bed together but there's no doubt obama is very
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:55.720]  anti-liberty anti-freedom and the good news is dr. Corsi I don't see him
[1:54:55.720 --> 1:55:00.480]  getting away with any of this I think everybody knows he is a con artist lying
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:04.440]  scammer reading off a teleprompter and I think he's gonna be one of the most
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:07.520]  unpopular presidents ever I don't think there's any way he's gonna win
[1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:12.040]  reelection when I wrote the obamination I compared him to Jimmy Carter and I
[1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:15.800]  think he's gonna do worse than Jimmy Carter I don't see him I don't see
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:19.760]  president Obama surviving to get into a second term to be reelected I mean I
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:24.600]  don't think politically he's gonna survive to have the ratings he's gonna
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:27.920]  need to get reelected to a second term I think he's a one-term president well
[1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:33.440]  I've never seen him look angry in these clips he looks like an egomaniac somebody
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:37.480]  with an egomaniac doesn't care people think he looks upset in the eyes so
[1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:41.600]  which makes him dangerous in closing doc you've been talking to hawaii about the
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:45.240]  birth certificate copies and all this what do you really think's going on with
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:48.720]  the birth certificate I mean I mean I mean isn't there enough issues we can
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:53.160]  prove that destroy this criminal or I mean do you think the birth certificate
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:56.400]  really has something to it well I think this is the birth certificate to me this
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:00.800]  is the issue why is it if I just feel president Obama is telling the truth
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:06.320]  born in Hawaii so why doesn't he just end this entire controversy today
[1:56:06.320 --> 1:56:11.360]  president Obama say okay you want to see my long-form original birth certificate
[1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:15.240]  here it is I'll show it to you it's supposed to be a transparent presidency
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:20.480]  instead president Obama candidate Obama put hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:24.840]  down to the million in order to prevent anybody from being that document is
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:29.360]  birth certificate the original long-form one as well as dozens of other
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:32.520]  documents about who he is and now you're talking to Hawaii and they're being
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:37.160]  secretive well Hawaii won't answer questions Hawaii will not even authenticate
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:42.320]  that the short-form certificate of law at live birth at the campaign and site like
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:47.040]  fact check dot org put out our authentic I can't get them to authenticate but again
[1:56:47.040 --> 1:56:51.320]  fact check is one of their sorrows organs isn't it an Annenberg organization
[1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:56.680]  at high back into the left Annenberg again at the association as it is a
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:02.280]  foundation where up then prior to being senator Obama when he was community
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:07.720]  organizer of all my bill air both work I showed that in the Obamination but by
[1:57:07.720 --> 1:57:12.040]  pointing out Alex is this there's a school there's a score a document this is
[1:57:12.040 --> 1:57:16.400]  the least benefit president president obama that we've ever had what about
[1:57:16.400 --> 1:57:21.640]  his passport record how about his record in Indonesia to be very sataro I
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:25.680]  mean he is the only president who had aliases and other names before he
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:31.240]  really is creepy I want to see his law firm record he's admitted that is a
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:36.840]  lawyer Obama worked with Tony Rezco who's now in federal prison I'd like to
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:40.680]  see the hours that he filled and how much work he really did in that law firm
[1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:46.600]  for Tony Rezco how about his records at Occidental College did he was rooming
[1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:50.160]  with Pakistani students usually universities don't put US students with
[1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:54.880]  foreign exchange students did Barack Obama apply as a foreign exchange student
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:58.720]  he traveled to Pakistan with those students that he go into the Indonesian
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:03.040]  passport that he haven't in Indonesia yeah we know they've sealed all his
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:07.360]  records like no president everything you know they are acting very very
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:10.680]  suspicious and that's the birth certificate issue they maybe the big
[1:58:10.680 --> 1:58:15.240]  secret is saying he was born in Kenyai I'm gonna investigate a recorder I can't
[1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:19.840]  prove that I'm just saying give us the document we want to see the document and
[1:58:19.840 --> 1:58:25.080]  what why does even a birth certificate of long form have to be a top secret

[2:00:12.360 --> 2:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:29.400]  Alex Jones it is Friday August 7 2009 we're the halfway point this
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:35.160]  transmission two hours massive news blitzes on the economy on the police
[2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:42.080]  state on saber rattling with Russia and Iran it is all coming up Bob Chapman in
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:46.920]  the next segment and we've got the lawyer for a black man beat up by Obama
[2:00:46.920 --> 2:00:54.320]  supporters on camera and then the media spun it and was so disingenuous that I
[2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:59.080]  read the articles and thought they were talking about anti-Obama people being
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:02.920]  arrested when it was pro-Obama people being arrested with some anti so just
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:06.880]  amazing as we try to decipher this with eyewitnesses and others coming up
[2:01:06.880 --> 2:01:10.240]  because this country is on the edge of revolution when I say that I mean it but
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:14.400]  Dr. Corsi I held you over for four or five minutes because I mainly got young
[2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:20.680]  about the birther situation and then we got off into other issues this SPP
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:24.880]  meeting going on under a new name this weekend and the news blackout but for
[2:01:24.880 --> 2:01:28.880]  those for some stations that just joined us in a nutshell and correct me if I'm
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:32.800]  wrong you're saying you don't know whether it was born or Kenya or not it's
[2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:37.160]  that he was in Indonesia he lied about being in a Muslim school now he brags
[2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:43.200]  about it wouldn't be bad if he was honest he had this very sataro name
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:47.800]  they've sealed all these documents college documents when he stayed in the
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:52.280]  Muslim Pakistani dorms which they would only do with a Muslim you know the fact
[2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:57.800]  is he's lied about everything and they only give us this receipt of the birth
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:01.920]  certificate and they brought that out early when nobody was pointing it out
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:07.200]  break that down for us well we need to see the original long form birth
[2:02:07.200 --> 2:02:12.080]  certificate list the hospital the doctor who was attending the birth why is that
[2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:16.640]  a top-secret document a president Obama telling the truth when one day you can
[2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:20.440]  have this go away just show us the long form birth certificate the president
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:23.760]  Obama won't do that and candidate Obama wouldn't either
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:27.880]  Obama has now spent over a million dollars to prevent anybody in the
[2:02:27.880 --> 2:02:32.160]  public from seeing this top-secret document his original long form birth
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:37.600]  certificate and it's one of a series of documents we don't have his records in
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:41.920]  Indonesia was he adopted by his stepfather I've got the records that
[2:02:41.920 --> 2:02:46.880]  say he was at school in Indonesia for four years registered as Indonesian
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:52.240]  citizen and a Muslim was that an official citizenship does Obama have an
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:56.960]  Indonesian passport or did he ever we can't see President Obama's passport
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:03.080]  record none of the school record Obama's kindergarten records are sealed it's high
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:06.920]  school records that's one of the words sealed you can't see the Occidental
[2:03:06.920 --> 2:03:12.240]  College records or the Columbia records or at Harvard Law School records we
[2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:17.000]  can't see his passport record we don't don't have any of his work in Chicago
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:21.640]  how about the law firm he worked with I'd like to see the hours he built he did
[2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:28.480]  work for now federal felon Tony Resco how many hours did he build Resco well
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:31.040]  let's briefly talk about the Muslim issue and then you've got to go in about
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:35.280]  a minute and a half well I mean if he was honest about being a Muslim his dad's
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:38.800]  a Muslim his cousin that he helps slaughter Christians with on records a
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:43.040]  Muslim you know he said oh don't call me Hussein Obama now he says you better
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:47.600]  call me Hussein Obama he speaks Arabic perfectly the Muslims are all stunned
[2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:52.960]  he he says I have I have Muslim roots I mean it's he went to a madrasa he's
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:57.360]  clearly a Muslim and that's okay but it's the lying about it we now have our
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:01.400]  first Muslim president basically well here's what I've proved that I've been
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:07.160]  able to get the record in Indonesia I was there from ages six to ten with his
[2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:12.760]  stepfather who is Muslim Obama was registered at two schools as an
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:16.760]  Indonesian citizen and as a Muslim now I can't prove we can't get any other
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:21.040]  record I can't prove whether he was officially an Indonesian citizen or
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:26.000]  whether he was adopted I did prove he attended at least one year of Islamic
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:31.400]  instruction and in Indonesia and of course the Obama campaign had denied
[2:04:31.400 --> 2:04:36.640]  that President Obama had ever had any Islamic instruction now he says in Cairo
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:40.720]  and a speech in Cairo that President Obama brags that he's experienced Islam
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:44.600]  on three continents well I'd like to have that more precisely defined with
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:49.400]  truth well listen I really appreciate you Dr. Corsi joining us we'll have you
[2:04:49.400 --> 2:04:53.320]  on again as the new book America for Sale comes out how do we ever get a

[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:07.720]  let's go ahead and go to the CNN piece and then to Bob Chapman
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:14.720]  the Joker serious you'd look serious too if you were the president of the United
[2:14:14.720 --> 2:14:21.280]  States being portrayed as the Joker oh my god oh my god oh my goodness goodness
[2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:25.880]  and the Joker don't usually go together but on conservative websites this image
[2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:31.280]  is the latest thing someone took time magazines cover and transformed it hope
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:37.720]  was changed to joke the image is making its way onto t-shirts and onto a few
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:43.640]  posters alongside a highway ramp in LA accompanied by the word socialism the
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:48.160]  image got rush limbaugh's attention becoming cool to make fun of Obama
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:53.880]  maybe not quite so much in New York City yucky extremely disturbing stupid
[2:14:53.880 --> 2:14:57.720]  seems kind of childish or the like the guy and I you still don't do that to
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:03.200]  anybody shame on them shame doesn't seem to be inhibiting critics bravo mr.
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:08.960]  president bravo the White House had no comment on the Joker image what to the
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:14.000]  Joker and socialism have to do with one another anyway writer and Joker fan
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:18.760]  Robert Docherty points out that the Joker supports anarchy I think if you're
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:22.640]  going to call Obama's socialists and then compare him to an anarchist I think
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:25.440]  that undercuts your point the only sensible way to live in this world is
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:29.320]  without rules Obama critics could counter that the president and the Joker
[2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:35.480]  tend to give away money money money money money who do you try to cash in the
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:41.120]  website hero builders plans to sell an Obama Joker action figure for 50 bucks
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:45.840]  a piece but for some the images downright disturbing I think I do have a
[2:15:45.840 --> 2:15:49.920]  problem with the white face makes me think of blackface back when president
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:53.560]  Bush was in office he there's no doubt they're printing our flyers off those
[2:15:53.560 --> 2:16:00.800]  are actually our flyers right wing because we slightly changed it she's
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:05.480]  got our print off have a nice day oh CNN does not like it that's how ours is a
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:11.320]  clock maybe it's time to give the Joker joke a rest oh they are really upset
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:16.080]  New York all right that's it also that's it I'm announcing another thousand
[2:16:16.080 --> 2:16:20.560]  dollar prize with no second or third place we don't have the money for the
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:26.200]  best Joker video that also plugs info wars.com there'll be another thousand
[2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:30.000]  dollar prize with everybody in whiteface as the Joker and that's it send the
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:34.520]  guys to the costume shop South Congress get me the Joker stuff I'm gonna do a
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:38.960]  Joker because anything that catches the public's attention we will use to
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:42.800]  expose these criminals to end cap and trade the open borders the gun grabbing
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:47.040]  the socialized medicine all all of it we got a really good because this is they
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:51.360]  built him up as this God and by pulling him down we defeat that image our
[2:16:51.360 --> 2:16:56.480]  founders lampoon King George the third it is essential to pull down their idols
[2:16:56.480 --> 2:17:01.200]  what do you say to that Bob Chapman you're absolutely correct a reverse
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:07.320]  psychology snapping it right back in their face in fact I'm gonna do a
[2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:12.920]  special broadcast at four o'clock today one hour after the show is over I'm
[2:17:12.920 --> 2:17:19.160]  gonna do 30 minutes live as guys can you stay late for that four to four thirty
[2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:23.040]  I'm gonna do what about jaren I need two people on this I'm gonna take an hour
[2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:29.480]  break to get into Joker attire and then I'm gonna do 15 20 minutes as the Joker
[2:17:29.480 --> 2:17:35.600]  prison planet dot TV and the audio streams at four o'clock today central go
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:41.040]  ahead Bob Chapman well I think that sounds like a great idea and that'll
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:45.640]  drill them a little deeper and you know I hear these comments coming out of New
[2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:51.200]  York City that are so sophisticated I don't see anything very sophisticated
[2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:58.760]  about socialism well I tell you this is getting crazier and crazier and crazier
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:02.920]  look I want to sit back and go over with you because you were in military
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:06.000]  intelligence and fought the Soviets and you've studied and you've been fighting
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:10.880]  the new order for 45 years by the way Dr. Corsi wanted me to say hi to you on
[2:18:10.880 --> 2:18:17.160]  air so he's a fan of what you do when we come back they really are having Obama
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:22.680]  goons I guess Joker has goons Joker has thugs he has a crew of a pimp daddy's
[2:18:22.680 --> 2:18:27.040]  out there pimping the hose I want to talk about how they're beating up people
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:31.040]  now that show up to shout down the congressman and then the media spins
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:34.840]  it and says we're the one starting the fights
[2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:42.360]  well in the squad goon squads in fact maybe I'll put the guys in Joker attire
[2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:48.000]  with clown mask and I can have my goon squad and maybe that's the new you know
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:52.800]  I think this I think this poster cut through to his soul of gangster evil
[2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:59.640]  and lies Bob you know it's interesting they use the same kind of goons squads
[2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:07.080]  back in the 20s and 30s to suppress the labor unions and the labor movement
[2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:11.920]  itself and it was very violent I don't know whether most people know that
[2:19:11.920 --> 2:19:18.280]  and you know people were hired like regulators who stood outside the factory
[2:19:18.280 --> 2:19:23.320]  and if you came near there or you if you walked around with a sign saying unfair
[2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:27.320]  wages or something like that you know they send 50 of these people in the
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:31.240]  clubs and they start beating people to death well now what they do is there's
[2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:35.520]  no jobs for the union people they just get paid by acorn or some other group
[2:19:35.520 --> 2:19:41.000]  Obama's given millions and they beat you up so I guess the new job for the unions
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:45.520]  is just beating people up and and you can't make this up they have brown
[2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:51.400]  khaki pants and and black jackets and red shirts so it's like some kind of
[2:19:51.400 --> 2:19:55.640]  cobra commander outfit or something I mean pure fascist colors Bob let's break
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:59.520]  it down get into the economy and a lot more straight ahead with Bob Chapman

[2:24:20.040 --> 2:24:26.000]  crew 4 p.m. simple today special 30-minute show in here in this seat
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:35.920]  got someone to blame all right Bob Chapman let's get serious here I see the
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:41.400]  establishment staging a terror attack on themselves to demonize the activists
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:44.520]  and even Dr. Corsi is pretty mainline says that's why they're attacking the
[2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:48.160]  demonstrators and then saying on the news that the demonstrators against Obama
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:52.360]  did this is a form of false flag but I see him having to do something bigger
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:56.800]  he's at the lowest approval rating of any president in history seven months in
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:01.200]  he's plunging the globalist on every front are in trouble both parties are
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:07.880]  being booed off the stage the media wants to cover that fact up where do you
[2:25:07.880 --> 2:25:18.560]  see this going Bob I think as long as he continues to not expose his two birth
[2:25:18.560 --> 2:25:24.720]  certificate improve that he's an American citizen that will be part of the
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:30.440]  demonstration process which is going to continue and then the people are irate
[2:25:30.440 --> 2:25:39.920]  about that but also about the Obama medical reform euthanasia plan and you
[2:25:39.920 --> 2:25:44.560]  know most people don't want to lose their private insurance and they don't want
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:50.480]  socialized medicine and then you have the cap and trade which is nothing but a
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:57.560]  new tax and incidentally we don't know what form a final bill will be in the
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  medical the insurance thing but I would expect even if they tighten it up it's
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:10.600]  going to increase that just one issue alone will increase taxation 10 to 15
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:14.800]  percent and the cap and trade will increase to 20 percent so you're looking
[2:26:14.800 --> 2:26:20.560]  at extra 35 so if you're in a 25 tax bracket you're going to be in for 60
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:25.960]  percent and then you get all those other taxes you get a pay so you're going to
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:30.080]  be in for 70 percent if those two issues are passed and you're going to lose
[2:26:30.080 --> 2:26:34.600]  worry your freedom and I think that people are going to Dennis demonstrate
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:43.720]  wholeheartedly you know I projected in January that his rating for
[2:26:43.720 --> 2:26:50.360]  approval would be about 40 percent and by September October and it looks like
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:57.080]  it's headed there what about stage crises though I mean how do you see the
[2:26:57.080 --> 2:27:01.240]  establishment countering as the people completely wake up what just trying to
[2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:04.240]  make it partisan so people that wake up think the Republicans will save them
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:09.960]  I think people waking up or way past that well I think that when you see people
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:15.200]  with light colored clothing on such as khakis and and red shirts and black
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:18.400]  jackets you know that they were all working together and I mean that's a
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:25.960]  dumb as dumb but anyway they have goons running around now and they're going
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:30.040]  to be going to these different meetings and demonstrations they're going to be
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:35.320]  causing trouble and they knew this was coming they knew the American people
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:40.920]  were going to put up with it so they've created a giant thug force that's right
[2:27:40.920 --> 2:27:49.600]  and what I'm afraid of too is that other people who are demonstrating that they
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:54.160]  might form their own counter force I mean this is what happened in Germany
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:28:01.280]  during the 1930s and 20s as well and especially in the 20s people don't
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:08.000]  reason realize it but there there were lots and lots hundreds of armies armies
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:14.200]  of people 50 people are 20,000 people and they would march around in their
[2:28:14.200 --> 2:28:19.040]  uniforms and do their thing and that's right the Nazis were a group of just a
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.760]  few hundred a little socialist group in Munich that then got bigger when Army
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:26.320]  intelligence got involved because they were scared of the communists so the
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:31.280]  government really secretly built the Nazis up as their thug force and that
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:36.280]  brings us to the next point blackwater the nation magazine federal court cases
[2:28:36.280 --> 2:28:42.120]  with with Marines saying that Eric Prince had them killing people inside the
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:45.520]  organization that we're going to whistle blow we know the military killed Pat
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:50.520]  Tillman and has killed hundreds in Iraq that blow the whistle on corruption man
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:56.760]  this is really getting wild it certainly is and it has happened and I notice also
[2:28:56.760 --> 2:29:04.680]  that the blackwater people were hired out as personal assassins to different
[2:29:04.680 --> 2:29:14.240]  groups as well as the CIA and that they were running whorehouses and engaging
[2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:22.160]  in pimping for young girls and held them as hostages hostages and bondage if
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:26.880]  you may I don't know if you saw that that's what
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:33.520]  din carp did in Bosnia oh yeah we've been covering that for years Dinecore and
[2:29:33.520 --> 2:29:36.960]  Halliburton were involved in that when they got caught they just changed their
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:40.720]  name so we're gonna cover that when we get back we're gonna open the phones up

[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:02.320]  implicated in murder I don't know about mr. Prince on this count but I do know
[2:36:02.320 --> 2:36:07.800]  that Israel has bragged themselves years after we covered it that they have
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:11.960]  hit teams in the US killing people and that they use Delta Force to kill people
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:16.640]  in the US and abroad so and people don't people think that's tough or cool no
[2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:21.120]  once secret groups in the government kill who they want when they want you
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:26.200]  were in total tyranny and that's like the NSA surveils Congress and the NSA
[2:36:26.200 --> 2:36:30.360]  for the British surveils their parliament the black op government that
[2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:35.200]  works for Wall Street is robbing everything Goldman Sachs has a special
[2:36:35.200 --> 2:36:39.200]  computer jacked into the stock exchange stealing money with an algorithm and
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:45.160]  Barney Frank says oh that's okay it's all rigged Bob Chapman your take on all
[2:36:45.160 --> 2:36:51.080]  this it's all rigged and you're absolutely right I think getting back to
[2:36:51.080 --> 2:37:01.480]  the the Blackwater group fostered under the Bush administration especially it's
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:06.280]  just a license to kill they do what they want and someone from the inside for
[2:37:06.280 --> 2:37:10.960]  whatever reason has come out and expose them and of course they know that their
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:16.840]  lives are going to be in danger and they've been willing to take that risk
[2:37:16.840 --> 2:37:22.960]  but sure that's what they've been doing and they're not the only ones I'm sure
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:27.640]  that the other contractors were doing the same thing and the CIA's done it for
[2:37:27.640 --> 2:37:32.920]  years I mean anything goes and now one other one of the reasons I did not
[2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:38.520]  continue to work in counterintelligence because you know these people I said to
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:44.400]  myself you know in 1958-59 I said these people is it are far worse than the
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:50.000]  mafia well it turns out the Italian mob was just some minions they use for some
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:53.560]  dirty work and when they got too big for their britches they demonize them and
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:57.720]  shut them down you know back then the Italian mob wasn't running child
[2:37:57.720 --> 2:38:02.040]  kidnapping rings for sex perverts but you know now the whole global mob does and
[2:38:02.040 --> 2:38:06.240]  you're right Dinecore much bigger much more wicked now they changed their name
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:12.120]  three years ago they are on record kidnapped over 1,100,000 people I
[2:38:12.120 --> 2:38:17.120]  know that's a huge number to believe but that was back in the early 2000s first
[2:38:17.120 --> 2:38:22.440]  three three years of the millennium and they don't even get in trouble I mean it
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:26.880]  just it's totally lawless it's a big joke to them and now they want to steal
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:30.680]  all our pension funds and take over America and North com standing by to do
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:36.120]  it our lives depend on discrediting this government don't they Bob right and
[2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:41.760]  you know one of the concepts here I'd like to talk about that I and many many
[2:38:41.760 --> 2:38:45.960]  others get sucked into with the second world war the Korean War you know
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:53.960]  serving and that is all it was was to further the interest of the powers
[2:38:53.960 --> 2:39:00.440]  behind government and I found that a long time ago but they do anything that
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:07.400]  they want and that's what's so frightening and they use this secret
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:16.400]  force plus the military to cow people in other countries and force them to
[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:23.040]  accept what they want to do example you take a place like that let's take the
[2:39:23.040 --> 2:39:28.720]  Bahamas I used to live there and they came to the government there and they
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:33.120]  said look this is the way it's going to be you're going to turn over all the
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:37.680]  information that we want you to on all kinds of accounts and corporations and
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:42.480]  things like that and if you don't do that then what's going to happen is we'll
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:48.360]  you know disrupt your government no more electronic communications no internet
[2:39:48.360 --> 2:39:54.680]  no post no airplanes no boats I will just shut you off from humanity and if
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:40:00.120]  that doesn't work we'll liquidate you and I get that from a president a former
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:06.040]  president of the Bahamas at a dinner well what did ABC news we're going on for
[2:40:06.040 --> 2:40:10.560]  years Alex yeah well what did ABC news report two months ago we put it on
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:16.040]  screen Merck said we must go to the homes of any scientists saying our
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:20.240]  products are killing people and liquidate them we must seek and destroy
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:24.880]  them that came out in federal court documents and the media spun it oh they
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:29.600]  just meant that ha ha ha but then you go look all these people got killed I mean
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:33.800]  that's just corporate business now just murder those people lock and load you
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:39.400]  know and then we're supposed to trust these people and take their vaccines not
[2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:44.320]  at all and those are all those bioscientists at one way or the other
[2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:49.560]  died and that was that was the drug drug companies getting rid of them and who
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:57.600]  helps them do that the CIA and other organizations they hire them and why
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:04.080]  because the major stockholders in the and the drug companies are foundations
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:09.200]  and holdings of members of the Illuminati I don't know what the percentage is up
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:16.360]  but they're very high you know what's also interesting was that blackwater
[2:41:16.360 --> 2:41:20.920]  was smuggling weapons into Iraq that's in the nation and Time magazine that's
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:25.000]  what our military sources told us years ago and then it came out British
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:29.320]  special forces Israeli US special forces and mercenaries and that's what Wayne
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:33.800]  Madsen's been reporting on the troops keep catching truckloads of weapons
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:39.280]  being brought to Wahhabist to kill US forces and that most of all those
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:42.680]  bombings and stuff and bombings of Mosque Ray McGovern former chief CIA
[2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:46.200]  briefer for Ronald Reagan came on the show and said they blew up that mosque to
[2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:50.840]  get Shiite and Sunni killing each other it turns out there was very little real
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:55.760]  war going on there you don't know I mean I mean the contractors a lot of
[2:41:55.760 --> 2:42:00.560]  evidence shows grease their own people and hang them up on bridges to then have
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:05.160]  a pretext to get more funding they run false flags against themselves not just
[2:42:05.160 --> 2:42:09.560]  against the troops I mean these people are more Machiavelli than Machiavelli
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:13.440]  anything to make a buck
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:20.040]  it's as simple as that they will do anything to make money and I don't care
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:23.800]  what the fallout is because they have they get out of jail free card they work
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:28.880]  for a contractor or they work for the government they do what they want yeah
[2:42:28.880 --> 2:42:32.720]  but how stupid would one of these say special forces green beret whatever
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:37.520]  Navy SEAL be to go to work for a big contractor don't they know these
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:42.680]  companies kill them later now they don't I don't think I don't think that they
[2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:46.360]  believe that they would do that and they think that they're one of them and you
[2:42:46.360 --> 2:42:51.760]  gotta remember and I know this firsthand because I spent a lot of time with
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:57.800]  Navy SEALs in San Diego and I won't tell you the team numbers but if you if you're
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:02.360]  there in San Diego you can figure it out and I would sit around a dinner or
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:07.000]  something with them and they would be mown the fact and these guys most of the
[2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:11.160]  more in their 30s that the only thing they know how to do is murder people and
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:15.320]  they'd start telling me about some of the ops that they did in other countries
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:20.160]  we go in you know wipe out you know 800 people in a whack and things like this
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:25.240]  it's incredible stories and of course they would normally talk about it and
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:30.520]  some of them would break down and start crying I mean this is the true stories
[2:43:30.520 --> 2:43:37.600]  and so it has a human tola is what I'm saying here but yes they did that but
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:42.480]  they don't realize they think there's some sort of an honor or spree to court
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:49.000]  and it does not exist with these people I mean look at early north I mean the
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  first time I went in to see him he had my file on his desk I said oh I see you
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:44:01.400]  get my file he said yeah I said you want to talk about compromised you know about
[2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:07.480]  the book compromised you remember it I'm sure yes you want to talk about the
[2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:14.720]  the book on Mina yes and quite a long book and very good one it's still
[2:44:14.720 --> 2:44:21.920]  available and and he said no I don't want to talk about that also he was
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:25.080]  menacing you with your file and you said oh you want to talk about how you're
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:31.000]  compromised yeah I always found when you go into meet people like that you got
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:35.120]  to take command of the situation and quite frankly I knew he was a wimp
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:40.640]  because I know people who serve with them especially in Granada and so other
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:46.040]  army officers army marine officers and they told me so they told me how to
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:50.080]  handle this guy so I didn't say hey I'm the boss
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:55.840]  why did he why did he get in your face I mean why are you meeting with what
[2:44:55.840 --> 2:45:01.120]  power he had that he was really connected but no I mean I'm interested
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:05.560]  about this Ali North story as we've had him on before tell me about why you were
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:11.280]  being called into his office because he wanted me to do public relations for his
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:18.480]  company oh so it was a friendly thing well it was a business thing yeah don't
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:22.960]  you think they were just trying to recruit you back in maybe it wasn't
[2:45:22.960 --> 2:45:31.040]  very successful yeah it's because I know there's no way I would do that yeah
[2:45:31.040 --> 2:45:36.280]  why'd you even with him at this point oh it's an old man yeah but yeah but why
[2:45:36.280 --> 2:45:41.160]  did you even why do you meet with him and just to see what he wanted yeah I
[2:45:41.160 --> 2:45:45.400]  wanted to look at the company and the company was not very good they were
[2:45:45.400 --> 2:45:52.360]  making bulletproof vests and and they didn't have any contracts and there was
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:57.080]  really nothing to bring to the public's attention that was that was positive for
[2:45:57.080 --> 2:46:04.600]  the company oh he wanted you to do PR for him yeah mm-hmm interesting Bob and
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:10.440]  I've done a lot of that okay shifting gears well one more question on black
[2:46:10.440 --> 2:46:14.040]  water do you think this is going to teach him a lesson that all this is
[2:46:14.040 --> 2:46:18.000]  coming out or will this just further encourage it and next it'll be oh yes
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:21.120]  every neighborhood has its mercenaries over you and if you get out of line
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:26.040]  they're going to double cap you I mean is it just can turn into that I think
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:30.680]  that it's a neutral thing they'll continue to do it I think in that they're
[2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:37.240]  bulletproof so to speak and how far these charges go remains to be seen you
[2:46:37.240 --> 2:46:42.600]  don't remember that these people not just in black water but in Washington who
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:46.920]  are backing them up are going to protect them and it it's not going to get into
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:50.640]  court they're going to kill these people who have made the complaints and made
[2:46:50.640 --> 2:46:57.680]  these statements and will it stop there probably I mean that they were very very
[2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:02.280]  powerful you you can't use the court system and in goodness knows Alex you
[2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:06.560]  know that I mean it's a two-tiered system for those who are connected and
[2:47:06.560 --> 2:47:10.800]  those who aren't look at look at Greenberg who ran AIG that they find
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:18.360]  a $15 million it's chump's change he stole billions yeah it's a joke you
[2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:22.320]  steal and make two billion and you pay a $15 million fine and it's literally a
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:26.840]  huge joke and he goes and has a beer with a judge afterwards Michael Milken
[2:47:26.840 --> 2:47:35.840]  stole $3 billion and so he gave back $1 billion and kept two it's all about
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:42.800]  money it's all about power I mean you know I observe these things in my
[2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:46.720]  publication if you notice at the end of a paragraph where somebody gets off the
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:52.200]  hook a GE just get off the hook the other day for $50 million chump change they
[2:47:52.200 --> 2:47:57.560]  neither admit nor deny nor do they ever get charged criminally and they've
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:48:01.520]  committed fraud and they should be charged criminally and then not why
[2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:05.960]  because they're aluminumist or aluminumist connected and that's what's
[2:48:05.960 --> 2:48:09.000]  going to happen with black water
[2:48:09.640 --> 2:48:15.280]  well it's seriously bad news on the economy what are the economic numbers
[2:48:15.280 --> 2:48:18.880]  I mean it looks like all the Main Street numbers are just imploding faster than
[2:48:18.880 --> 2:48:21.960]  ever but meanwhile they're saying oh look at the stock market it's up it's
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:27.360]  actually down the last few days is that another suckers rally it surely is and
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:31.640]  the reason the market went up today was because of the employment report and
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:36.760]  they would have us believe that unemployment went down from 9.5 to
[2:48:36.760 --> 2:48:48.920]  9.4 percent and that they were only a smaller amount of jobs last lost which
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:57.840]  were 247,000 now I give you a secret to this and they said that that there were
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:04.480]  revisions for 43,000 which is not a lot but what they use is this birth death
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:09.560]  ratio which we discussed before what government goes and says look we can't
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:14.480]  figure out how many people are hired or fired by small and medium-sized companies
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:19.240]  we just couldn't cover everybody so we're going to guess at it and they guess they
[2:49:19.240 --> 2:49:27.480]  make new jobs over old jobs as a net of plus 185,000 a month now they do that on
[2:49:27.480 --> 2:49:34.520]  a basis where it's not 185,000 each and every month one month month they may
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:41.600]  create 50,000 jobs in the next month 200,000 out of thin air now last July
[2:49:41.600 --> 2:49:48.920]  that's a year ago this past July they create they they had 1.4 million jobs
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:55.040]  that were lost and then they seasonally adjusted them showing a loss of only a
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:50:00.240]  hundred and 28,000 now I don't know yet what they did with these figures
[2:50:00.240 --> 2:50:05.000]  unfortunately I'll know tomorrow but the figures that came out that made the
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:10.560]  market go up today were totally bogus well that's asinine I mean they're
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:15.760]  saying Obama says oh we may go above 10% unemployment when every major
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:22.480]  institution outside of government said to spend over 20 points for months well
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:27.600]  they're starting to say so now because they finally I'm getting myself and
[2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:32.200]  particularly John Williams are getting enough coverage so everybody's saying
[2:50:32.200 --> 2:50:37.160]  gosh they must be right you know like after 10 years of telling everybody that
[2:50:37.160 --> 2:50:41.520]  they've been doing what they've been doing but that's what made the market
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:47.080]  rally early morning well tell us about when we get back we'll take some calls
[2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:51.400]  Bob but I was just gonna say I last night driving home almost ran off the
[2:50:51.400 --> 2:50:57.440]  road Fox News on local 590 said that it was much higher than 10% because they
[2:50:57.440 --> 2:51:00.920]  don't count people that have quit looking for jobs so the truth is coming up
[2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:05.200]  heart-related health problems affect millions of people each year maybe
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:09.160]  you're one of the many who suffer from issues related to angina pain high
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:13.400]  blood pressure congestive heart failure unbalanced cholesterol irregular
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:17.800]  heartbeat or clondardaries there is a solution that doesn't involve expensive
[2:51:17.800 --> 2:51:21.640]  prescription drugs that only mask the problem and leave you with horrible

[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:26.160]  downtown Bob let's hold you five more minutes over if you can so we can take
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:31.400]  a few calls from Steve Jim Jeff Larry and Ben but but just briefly is it this
[2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:35.760]  what Max Kaiser and others are saying I want to see if you concur is it all the
[2:54:35.760 --> 2:54:39.760]  tens of trillions they've stolen in the 23.7 trillion they're buying up the
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:44.560]  stock market and so that's why it's a speculative thing it's now basically a
[2:54:44.560 --> 2:54:49.600]  commodity like gold or oil we see all that rising those dollars are going into
[2:54:49.600 --> 2:54:54.040]  that and we're seeing inflation there and that's why the market's going up but
[2:54:54.040 --> 2:54:59.800]  everything else is dying and when will we see that inflation flood out into the
[2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:04.960]  real economy well you have this battle that's been going on for five and a
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:10.000]  half years where they've been trying to keep inflation a deflation from getting
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:14.480]  out of hand and they've done that through the money supply and the creation
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:19.360]  of credit which was the old m3 and now it's happened over the last two years
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:26.160]  they had the opportunity to create 23 point four trillion dollars and that is
[2:55:26.160 --> 2:55:30.520]  what's going into these markets and if you notice this morning if you get up
[2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:34.720]  early you saw that the footsie in London and the Dax and Frankfurt were both off
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:39.240]  a hundred points or so and they were trading the Dow down about 40 points
[2:55:39.240 --> 2:55:47.240]  and then this bogus report comes out on on the employment numbers and we'll have
[2:55:47.240 --> 2:55:53.600]  further numbers and my next issue are probably on Wednesday on this and the
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:56:00.800]  stock market goes up 150 points and the footsie and which is the FTSE in London
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:07.880]  and the Dax they both go up 80 90 to 100 points and then at the same time they
[2:56:07.880 --> 2:56:15.400]  made the dollar on the USDX index go up a whole point and of course gold was
[2:56:15.400 --> 2:56:19.720]  down today and they try to get silver down but they couldn't and the point is
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:26.360]  these markets they are totally manipulated and these people don't care
[2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:30.640]  whether you know it or not and everybody on Wall Street knows it they just try to
[2:56:30.640 --> 2:56:35.000]  get in the right direction but that's the issue is the corruption just gets
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:39.080]  crazier and crazier and more and more obvious let's take a call Stephen
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:45.640]  Chicago you're on the air with Bob Chapman yes Bob you and I are older guys
[2:56:45.640 --> 2:56:51.320]  I you and I appreciate the apotheosis of a Barak was saying Obama but the
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:55.840]  reason why I called the article in the Washington Times today you have it's
[2:56:55.840 --> 2:56:59.420]  entitled justice the Justice Department press to explain Panthers drop
[2:56:59.420 --> 2:57:03.600]  charges now there has to do with a case against the new black Panthers who were
[2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:07.400]  intimidating clearly intimidating they got pictures of it with clubs and guns
[2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:12.000]  and everything else and so anyways these charges were dropped as soon as Mr.
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:16.440]  Holder came in there of course he they colored the attorney general now what I
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:22.240]  want to do is I I want to quote a former deputy associate US attorney general
[2:57:22.240 --> 2:57:27.800]  said this quoting if you swap out the name of the new black Panther party in
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:31.920]  this case for neo-nazi groups of the Ku Klux Klan you would have had a
[2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:38.120]  different outcome he said now to me that means this is this is politically
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:41.800]  motivated now it is and I appreciate your call and they can commit the hate
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:45.800]  crimes see hate crime means if you're white you can have you you can be
[2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:49.520]  murdered and it's a wonderful thing and they give a medal to who kills you but
[2:57:49.520 --> 2:57:53.480]  if you're another group and somebody says something they don't like you get
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:57.880]  arrested but again that's only because the elite want to rob the middle class
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:58:02.120]  which they see is phenomenally white though it really isn't and so that's
[2:58:02.120 --> 2:58:06.960]  all this is about is divide and conquer Bob Chapman your comments and that's
[2:58:06.960 --> 2:58:12.280]  exactly what it is and they're setting groups against one another and they're
[2:58:12.280 --> 2:58:18.200]  just using people and all these poor fools that go and get sucked in by it
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:22.720]  short-changing themselves that's for sure yeah we need whites and blacks and
[2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:27.160]  everybody else to just stop killing each other like Rodney King said can't we all
[2:58:27.160 --> 2:58:31.200]  just get along and arrest the bankers as Rodney King said it can we all just get
[2:58:31.200 --> 2:58:35.080]  along and arrest David Rockefeller you really said that so why can't we just
[2:58:35.080 --> 2:58:40.280]  get along and in the fed and arrest the Rothschilds back in 70 seconds

[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:16.360]  of headlines I've gotten to and we have the lawyer who contact this for the
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:21.440]  black man beat up by the Obama supporters on video and the news didn't
[3:00:21.440 --> 3:00:25.400]  want to point that out they wanted to say that Republicans route causing
[3:00:25.400 --> 3:00:30.640]  problems when it's people mad across the board black white Republican Democrat
[3:00:30.640 --> 3:00:34.240]  libertarian we just are sick of the bankers and the corrupt political
[3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:41.240]  parties Jim in Chicago another call from Chicago go ahead Jim how you doing
[3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:46.200]  Alex good hey look I want to I want you I got a little bit of problem I've
[3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:50.040]  missed you for a long time I really like you Alex but we gotta lay off this
[3:00:50.040 --> 3:00:53.240]  you and your bash now I've been a union member 20 years and I don't work for a
[3:00:53.240 --> 3:00:58.440]  court okay I'm not a Democrat I'm not a Republican this new world order I've been
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:02.000]  fighting them my whole life because this is nothing but global fascism well let
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:06.160]  me just stop you remember to okay let me just stop you I think it was Bob earlier
[3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:10.000]  talking about them attacking unions not talk about Rockefellers having the
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.760]  union's machine gunned I was saying that more and more Obama is trying to take
[3:01:14.760 --> 3:01:19.120]  the unions over to use them as political weapons now they don't get jobs in
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:23.400]  factories they get jobs being thugs for the government I mean we've always
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:28.280]  supported unions here and so maybe I should be more specific and exact when
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:34.280]  I talk about this but it is union people attacking the anti-socialist health care
[3:01:34.280 --> 3:01:39.080]  folks I mean Obama is selling the unions out on NAFTA and GATT which he
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:44.240]  promised to get rid of so if I came off as being anti-union I'm sorry but that's
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:48.880]  not what I meant that's why I like listening but we get we get a bad
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:52.600]  view from everybody the mainstream media which is controlled by these global
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:57.160]  bankers that have been attacking us for 30 years as we've watched the decline of
[3:01:57.160 --> 3:02:00.560]  America it's been because of the client don't you mean I had tied tarply on
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:05.080]  every week and he just worships unions yeah but he will tell you that the
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:09.800]  unions have been taken over oh trust me I understand that but you got to say
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:13.280]  there's public sector private sector unions that the public sector really
[3:02:13.280 --> 3:02:16.480]  taken over I mean like on TV when they make the jokes about union guys not
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:21.280]  being able to get fired that's that's only that's only your bureaucrats you
[3:02:21.280 --> 3:02:24.440]  know guys at construction unions like me like the internet that's people in the
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:29.160]  government union no I'm well you know exactly but Bob Chapman you want to
[3:02:29.160 --> 3:02:33.720]  chime in on this the only thing I want to say is you're right Alex and he's
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:39.960]  right my father was a one of the original members of the teams to union and
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:45.280]  he was in the teams to union for 30 years and retired on a pension so you
[3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:52.000]  know where I'm coming from brought America to the middle class and and and
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:55.560]  global fascism greatest threat is organized labor that's why they've
[3:02:55.560 --> 3:02:59.040]  worked so hard for the last 30 years to destroy us that's why they've been
[3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:02.880]  devaluing the guy and they have destroyed the unions and and and so we have to be
[3:03:02.880 --> 3:03:06.080]  honest about what's happened to the unions if you ever want to have that
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:11.040]  bargaining power again you know the robber barons said hey unions compete
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:15.920]  with Chinese slave labor compete with Mexican slave labor and so now all that's
[3:03:15.920 --> 3:03:20.880]  left for the unions is to be thugs for the globalist as they mop up America so
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:26.520]  I'm telling the unions rebel against this another thing that we need here
[3:03:26.520 --> 3:03:31.760]  that'll really help the unions in America is trade led a trade
[3:03:31.760 --> 3:03:36.960]  legislation for tariffs on goods and services that is the key to bringing
[3:03:36.960 --> 3:03:41.760]  back manufacturing to the United States and if we could get Congress to pass
[3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:46.480]  that then all these companies that left would be forced to come back because it
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:50.160]  wouldn't be any advantage anymore because they'd be paying tariffs which
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:57.280]  would go into the federal coffers you're absolutely right Bob well listen I
[3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:02.400]  appreciate your call Jim it's good to hear from you Bob I know you're a busy
[3:04:02.400 --> 3:04:06.200]  busy creature you want to five six more minutes on the other side and talk to a
[3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:11.640]  Ben Joe and John absolutely all right we're gonna come back after break and
[3:04:11.640 --> 3:04:14.920]  talk to a few callers then I want to play a clip I've got the article here
[3:04:14.920 --> 3:04:19.560]  somewhere where where this guy's well somebody sent me an email of his YouTube
[3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:24.520]  attacking me saying I never talk about abolishing the Fed and I never talk
[3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:32.200]  about Congress abolishing the Fed and that's all we talk about here so I
[3:04:32.200 --> 3:04:36.520]  wanted to play this because it also illustrates how it seems like 99% of the
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:43.000]  time when I get criticized it's it's over strongmen it's not over real issues
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:47.600]  it's not over who I really am and you know let's say I'm even the worst guy
[3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:56.680]  since Timbuktu still we need to move on and deal with real issues that
[3:04:56.680 --> 3:05:02.800]  actually affect people not obsessing over me this is Alex Jones with five good
[3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:06.640]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer number

[3:05:10.160 --> 3:05:14.840]  number two our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[3:05:14.840 --> 3:05:18.960]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:23.240]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[3:05:23.240 --> 3:05:26.520]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:29.920]  demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:33.440]  storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power
[3:05:33.440 --> 3:05:37.640]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides
[3:05:37.640 --> 3:05:41.480]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[3:05:41.480 --> 3:05:45.280]  power generators offered by solution from science a long-time sponsor of ours

[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:03.600]  heck out of me anyhow I didn't get screened and I wanted to ask if I had to
[3:09:03.600 --> 3:09:08.240]  keep a mind point with money and so we don't screen the phone calls unless we
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:13.520]  have a guest on say about the murder of Patton by the OSS and then we just say
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:18.560]  please call in about that topic but no you can talk about whatever you want but
[3:09:18.560 --> 3:09:24.680]  go ahead sir absolutely I did not get screened okay fine I have a question for
[3:09:24.680 --> 3:09:29.120]  you and then a comment from Bob and the question to you and this is going to go
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:32.880]  to ten people that I work with that night I'll be going back Monday okay
[3:09:32.880 --> 3:09:38.480]  originally originally in the in the youth core legislation it was introduced
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:45.440]  and out to everyone that it was going to be mandatory that people would have to
[3:09:45.440 --> 3:09:50.480]  serve in the youth core and it gave the ages from you know junior high on up am
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:54.240]  I correct on that yeah there been a bunch of different bills we barely got it
[3:09:54.240 --> 3:09:57.480]  stripped out of the one but it still left the language in about setting up a
[3:09:57.480 --> 3:10:02.040]  board to start national compulsory service and my film the Obama deception
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:06.000]  has all the clips of Obama and the White House Eva staff Rahm Emanuel saying
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:12.120]  just that and it's to be a domestic military force to crack crack heads of
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:17.440]  the American people right but it was introduced at first as mandatory because
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:21.760]  I remember Jason I'm one of his yeah and they've reintroduced they've
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:27.560]  reintroduced the bills this will take me a couple seconds I know you're in our
[3:10:27.560 --> 3:10:32.200]  inner hurry here but I had a really interesting conversation with one of my
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:42.360]  labor labor relations managers it was back around 2005 and now give me a
[3:10:42.360 --> 3:10:46.040]  second out I'll tie it all together so you're saying that it's fine you're on
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:53.520]  air you weren't struggling back in back in 1995 I was pulling an engine out of
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:10:59.080]  my daughter's car and David Newman was a conservative talk show host in Detroit
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:03.840]  on WJR he had a guest on there and I never caught the name of the guest but
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:10.600]  the guest that was talking about the Clinton legacy and hang on one second
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:15.440]  the interesting thing that came out of it which made my jaw drop was that he
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:26.280]  said this guest said that they signed on to a UN legislation bill or some type of
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:30.840]  bill that was going to turn to United States the mid the mid North American
[3:11:30.840 --> 3:11:33.920]  continent not the United States I got to let you go okay because I got to get to
[3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:38.800]  other callers that was three minutes yes these are UNESCO treaties these are
[3:11:38.800 --> 3:11:45.320]  UN treaties it started under Clinton AmeriCorps secure core that's the
[3:11:45.320 --> 3:11:50.160]  city year TV ads with kids in uniforms doing military drills it's real Bob
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:57.360]  Chapman it surely is and it's the way you put it there you go short and sweet
[3:11:57.360 --> 3:12:02.480]  Ben in Minnesota you're on the air go ahead yeah how you guys doing today good
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:08.920]  yeah I got a question you guys in the healthcare bill is it says on one of the
[3:12:08.920 --> 3:12:13.520]  pages 354 says government will restrict the enrollment of special needs
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:18.920]  individuals what's your take on that I couldn't really understand you you said
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:22.320]  restrict the needs of neither government will watch we'll restrict
[3:12:22.320 --> 3:12:29.080]  enrollment of special needs individuals yeah they are going to the
[3:12:29.080 --> 3:12:33.240]  enrollment of home well I understand what he's saying I appreciate your call
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:39.280]  then look it's not our opinion in England in places where they have
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:44.040]  socialized health care they give you an aspirin for a heart attack they they the
[3:12:44.040 --> 3:12:48.160]  I mean it's in Time magazine that the doctors kill you in Europe when they
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:52.840]  decide and that Time magazine says that's a good idea I showed people that
[3:12:52.840 --> 3:12:58.360]  article two days ago Dashell wrote a book he was gonna be the head of this
[3:12:58.360 --> 3:13:03.560]  saying rationing is good you can read Google Tom Dashell quotes on rationing
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:08.480]  and I have the breakdown of the bill and the bill here and it is worse than
[3:13:08.480 --> 3:13:13.040]  Hillary Clinton's and it is single payer and it is socialism Bob Chapman
[3:13:13.040 --> 3:13:18.960]  your comments on the health care bill I think what like you said they'll give
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:24.840]  you an aspirin and in Europe and in the United States as well people are
[3:13:24.840 --> 3:13:33.040]  passing into to death that don't have to the cost of continuing to keep them
[3:13:33.040 --> 3:13:37.520]  alive goes almost straight to the government and so they've been told
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:42.280]  look if they're gonna go you know let them go and people with chronic
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:46.880]  diseases whether they're younger they're old are not gonna be treated they're
[3:13:46.880 --> 3:13:52.120]  gonna be allowed to die and there's also stuff on small businesses any
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:13:55.960]  employer with a yearly payroll of four hundred thousand dollars or above will
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:14:01.200]  pay an eight percent payroll tax they're gonna give you cruddy government
[3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:05.040]  health care but take thirty five hundred out of your check and then it's just
[3:14:05.040 --> 3:14:08.920]  like unemployment insurance you pay it you try collecting it for more than a
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:14.480]  few weeks it's all a scam it all look offshore banks a bankrupted America
[3:14:14.480 --> 3:14:19.320]  period they want everything they want higher taxes and just like a banana boat
[3:14:19.320 --> 3:14:23.520]  country it's all gonna go to them until we stand up and say no this is a fraud
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:30.000]  Bob absolutely and that's what's going on especially with these corporations
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:34.800]  that are exporting goods into the United States and then keeping their profits
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:40.200]  in tax havens and paying essentially no tax and then occasionally every four or
[3:14:40.200 --> 3:14:43.800]  five years they bring the money back the last time they paid five and a quarter
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:47.640]  percent taxes and they should have been paying thirty five percent and that was
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:51.720]  for three hundred and fifty billion dollars now they want to ship back seven
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:15:01.600]  billion well there are seven hundred excuse me there are over there are two
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:08.040]  thousand there are thousands of sections in this bill thousands of sections
[3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:12.280]  two thousand plus three thousand one hundred and forty one sections and I've
[3:15:12.280 --> 3:15:16.360]  tried to read over it I mean it's the end of America I mean it is a Swiss
[3:15:16.360 --> 3:15:22.720]  cheese of tyranny just cutting through every angle and it says all your bank
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:25.720]  accounts will be instantly always uploaded to the government they're
[3:15:25.720 --> 3:15:29.280]  already doing that it just legalizes total big brother the end of the bill of
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:33.560]  rights total control of everything and then Obama sits up there saying no it
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:39.800]  doesn't and fines and CPS visiting your kids and I mean Bob I can't believe how
[3:15:39.800 --> 3:15:43.920]  bad this is and if you try to go protest it they have goons that come and beat
[3:15:43.920 --> 3:15:51.560]  you up well they'll probably be in the parking lot waiting for you tonight
[3:15:51.560 --> 3:15:57.880]  life and before yeah years ago but they found out I enjoyed it at a sick level
[3:15:57.880 --> 3:16:04.000]  it it only made me to redouble my efforts so they leave me alone now pretty
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:09.760]  much stuff on the FBI drops by but you know what's what's a month without the
[3:16:09.760 --> 3:16:15.000]  FBI and the BATF yeah but I think they that they were enjoying it less than I
[3:16:15.000 --> 3:16:22.080]  was let's go ahead and talk to who's up next year Joe in Michigan you're on the
[3:16:22.080 --> 3:16:29.520]  air with Bob Chapman go ahead job hey Alex hey buddy yeah yeah I'm I'm I ain't
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:33.480]  got no credentials to announce or anything I'm just a regular human being
[3:16:33.480 --> 3:16:40.040]  married born America well I don't have any credentials either well my country
[3:16:40.040 --> 3:16:44.080]  I said the oath you know before I went to military and and I've been doing a lot
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:49.200]  of research and you know and I really appreciate your work is it's led me to
[3:16:49.200 --> 3:16:55.760]  all kinds of other areas of information I just uh you know I know how you get
[3:16:55.760 --> 3:16:59.000]  people on there to talk about the straw man concept and stuff but I'm not going
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:02.400]  to go on about straw man concept and I want to cut me off thinking I'll put me
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:06.520]  in that category I'm just I've studied it and I've studied you know jurisdiction
[3:17:06.520 --> 3:17:11.640]  and how everything boils down to jurisdiction and I'm thinking since
[3:17:11.640 --> 3:17:15.640]  there's a contract between the government and the Federal Reserve neither
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:18.880]  one is allowed to have jurisdiction over the other the only one that has
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:24.640]  jurisdiction is a human being that would claim that right and I don't know how
[3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:30.880]  you know if you get yes that's fundamentally true and and and we need
[3:17:30.880 --> 3:17:35.840]  to have Congress sever its connection to the private Federal Reserve that's
[3:17:35.840 --> 3:17:41.200]  created this debt black hole that is meant to ensnare all of us all I've
[3:17:41.200 --> 3:17:45.200]  said is look out with people talking about straw men and all this because
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:50.240]  most the stuff being put out about straw man is total fraud and these are
[3:17:50.240 --> 3:17:54.480]  charlatans that want you to sign trust with them so they can steal your
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:58.440]  property that's all I'm doing I'm like hey look out over there in that part of
[3:17:58.440 --> 3:18:03.120]  the lake there's some rocks under the water that doesn't mean that that the
[3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:08.280]  whole straw man thing isn't the lake I'm saying there's rocks in the lake Bob
[3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:15.720]  Chapman it's a subject I'm really not up on I'll pass on this one well there's a
[3:18:15.720 --> 3:18:19.920]  lot of patriot mythology and people never listen they always got to go to jail
[3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:25.120]  or get in trouble and file fake liens and all this delusional crap and I'm
[3:18:25.120 --> 3:18:29.440]  not saying the callers doing that then people think I'm yes the government
[3:18:29.440 --> 3:18:33.440]  creates a strong man yes through corporate fraud they get us to sign for
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:37.720]  the Social Security card and then that makes us a ward of the state under the
[3:18:37.720 --> 3:18:41.760]  amendment at the end of the Civil War that is how they operate fundamentally
[3:18:41.760 --> 3:18:47.280]  but then there's all this quackery attached to it that isn't real it's
[3:18:47.280 --> 3:18:52.240]  forced to juror force majeure the elite are just engaged in piracy and open
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:56.320]  free-booting against us blackwater doesn't even follow their own laws
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:19:00.960]  neither does the Pentagon they do what they want because political power goes
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:05.000]  out of the barrel of a gun and it's political force to go shut down all
[3:19:05.000 --> 3:19:08.400]  these political events and get rid of the illusion that the people are buying
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:12.800]  into this that's why they're punching people back on the nose and that's going
[3:19:12.800 --> 3:19:18.200]  to fail because the true revolution of 1776 a restoration is coming and nothing
[3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:22.400]  on earth kind of stop it Bob Chapman the international forecaster calm comes out
[3:19:22.400 --> 3:19:25.400]  twice a week tomorrow people get a free copy at the international forecaster

[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:43.680]  this guy is so self-righteous seems like he's well-meaning but I don't know what
[3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:48.480]  planet he's living on because all I talk about is ending the Fed all I talk
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:51.640]  about is Congress has the power to abolish the Federal Reserve all I talk
[3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:55.200]  about is getting the sponsors we need and explaining that we're gonna win this
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:19:59.640]  thing and having Ron Paul and others on supporting it well this guy says I don't
[3:19:59.640 --> 3:20:03.760]  he says I'm covering it up finally in the news this evening it's being reported
[3:20:03.760 --> 3:20:08.520]  that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid even
[3:20:08.520 --> 3:20:12.440]  as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to
[3:20:12.440 --> 3:20:16.200]  the limits of our nation's power grid some say that this summer's demand for
[3:20:16.200 --> 3:20:20.840]  electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of
[3:20:20.840 --> 3:20:25.520]  power outages across the country putting us all in the dark are you prepared
[3:20:25.520 --> 3:20:29.680]  for the next round of storm related outages or government created blackouts
[3:20:29.680 --> 3:20:33.680]  have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your
[3:20:33.680 --> 3:20:38.320]  own private supply of electrical power if so this will be the most important
[3:20:38.320 --> 3:20:42.920]  information you have ever heard solar powered generators are finally available
[3:20:42.920 --> 3:20:47.520]  they have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas
[3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:52.400]  whatsoever remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar

[3:24:11.240 --> 3:24:19.200]  okay it is very fashionable to attack me mainstream media alternative media and
[3:24:19.200 --> 3:24:25.760]  at a sick level it's actually very good for the show I mean a lot of the reason
[3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:29.680]  this show just has doubled probably in the last six months and audience
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:35.160]  affiliates everything it's it's scary his good people spreading the word about
[3:24:35.160 --> 3:24:40.880]  the broadcast but also people attacking and then vice versa I wake up more
[3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:46.000]  people than anybody else through our organization and then I kind of send all
[3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:51.880]  the people I wake up to then all the crazies and people lying about me so
[3:24:51.880 --> 3:24:57.680]  what would all my enemies do without me but I also run to a lot of people who
[3:24:57.680 --> 3:25:02.480]  really legitimately believe I'm bad but I think in this instant gratification
[3:25:02.480 --> 3:25:07.160]  society they must have never heard the show or never seen the Obama deception
[3:25:07.160 --> 3:25:12.400]  or never you know don't know what I'm all about I mean I've made 22 films and
[3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:16.180]  probably half of them are about abolishing the Fed and how Congress can
[3:25:16.180 --> 3:25:20.280]  do it and I I have guessed on I sell the money masters and they're planned to
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:24.080]  abolish the Fed and I have Ron Paul on you know back when he had six seven
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:30.040]  sponsors I've been having him on supporting the fact that Congress it's
[3:25:30.040 --> 3:25:38.040]  their job to abolish the fellow deserve I've been having him on since 1996 and
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:44.480]  that's 13 years for this and look I think the Federal Reserve deserves the
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:47.280]  blame not me I don't run the Federal Reserve I'm calling for it to be
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:52.760]  abolished and it's just strange because I always notice when I get attacked it's
[3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:58.360]  never real it's never true never there might be one percent sometimes that's
[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:02.720]  true I mean I guess a few of the attacks I get might be based in reality I get
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:06.520]  too excited or interrupt people or whatever but again it isn't about Alex
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:13.600]  Jones what are we going to do about these problems but I think there's more
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:17.160]  people trying to tear me down than there are trying to end the Fed but to say
[3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:21.880]  it's bad to go after Obama instead of going after Congress we are going after
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:26.600]  Congress and both parties but Obama was the big New World Order puppet the the
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:31.320]  one the Savior the messianic God everything was being put on him the
[3:26:31.320 --> 3:26:35.440]  carbon tax agenda the open borders the expansion of the Bank of the World that
[3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:40.640]  owns the Fed and so we had to go after him with the Obama deception that's why
[3:26:40.640 --> 3:26:44.120]  the next film goes after Obama as well because we're trying to defeat this but
[3:26:44.120 --> 3:26:47.200]  I'm not going to play the whole thing it's on YouTube I just wanted to reach
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:49.720]  out to this guy and others who look like they really believe what they're
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:54.360]  saying you say the Obama deception doesn't talk about going after the Fed and
[3:26:54.360 --> 3:26:58.600]  how Congress should do it there's a 10-minute scene protesting the Fed and
[3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:02.920]  talking about the legislation to end the Fed and Congress I mean the film is
[3:27:02.920 --> 3:27:11.160]  about ending the Fed I mean I can't am I guilty for Kennedy dying am I guilty for
[3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:15.400]  Jesus being crucified am I am I guilty when it when it's a rain cloud above or
[3:27:15.400 --> 3:27:20.400]  you slip on a banana peel I mean it isn't about Alex Jones okay let's go
[3:27:20.400 --> 3:27:25.040]  abolish the Fed I mean it's just not fair and then there'll be a whole movement
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:28.760]  that I'm defending the Fed and don't want it abolished and I found that it
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:39.200]  1913 here it is you guys gonna play a deception the Alex Jones deception
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:46.760]  rather is that Alex Jones never talks about who really has the power to end
[3:27:46.760 --> 3:27:53.080]  the Fed who really does have the power to end the Fed the United States House of
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:59.000]  Representatives the Congress all right we're having a rare internet glitch we're
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:03.640]  trying to get more internet put in here he never mentions the Congress in the
[3:28:03.640 --> 3:28:07.760]  whole movie he never mentions the Congress anywhere he talks about
[3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:13.680]  Obama is wrong that's not true I say the Congress both parties the private
[3:28:13.680 --> 3:28:17.200]  fellow reserve that we've the Congress has to abolish the Fed I mean that's not
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:24.160]  fair I mean that's not true I'm next it'll be I founded the Fed I mean keep
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:30.280]  playing it states House of Representatives the body of elected the
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:35.680]  people that run where Ron Paul serves those people have the power to do that
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:42.880]  now Alex Jones supporters collectively number in that in the millions put
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:49.360]  possibly tens of millions of listeners and people who believe that in in Alex
[3:28:49.360 --> 3:28:54.120]  Jones's message of restoring the constitutional Republic well according
[3:28:54.120 --> 3:28:58.800]  to the Constitution the United States House of Representatives has way more
[3:28:58.800 --> 3:29:03.560]  power than the president so we're wasting time that's enough this is
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:09.200]  legitimate this is as legitimate as saying Alex Jones doesn't support the
[3:29:09.200 --> 3:29:14.880]  Second Amendment I mean it's just and that's the thing is almost all attacks
[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:21.400]  against me are patently 100% asinine all we talk about is we've almost got
[3:29:21.400 --> 3:29:29.240]  290 I had Ron Paul on two days ago about we've got almost 290 sponsors to audit
[3:29:29.240 --> 3:29:33.720]  and then that leads to abolishing the Fed I mean I I have the army watching me
[3:29:33.720 --> 3:29:38.120]  and mainstream news articles because I'm trying to abolish the Fed there's DHS
[3:29:38.120 --> 3:29:43.080]  reports about coming after us because we're exposing them I mean all I talk
[3:29:43.080 --> 3:29:48.640]  about is the Congress abolishing the Fed I but I guess I'm guilty I guess I'm I
[3:29:48.640 --> 3:29:53.160]  guess everything's my fault okay I did it I'm bad we're on the March the

[3:34:11.040 --> 3:34:17.480]  individual who's there to participate at a town hall I'd have a reasonable civil
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:26.000]  discourse and then get up beaten up and pummeled by a three Union workers of

[3:35:54.960 --> 3:35:58.560]  American you know that's what's crazy about this is in my experiences and I'm
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:02.040]  not liberal or conservative I'm a constitutionalist but been around the
[3:36:02.040 --> 3:36:05.760]  country in the world it's liberals who'll come over and make a racial joke to
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:08.480]  you and when I've been hanging out with conservatives my whole life here in
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:11.800]  Texas I've never really heard conservatives at the deer camp calling
[3:36:11.800 --> 3:36:14.920]  black people names but then you're hanging around with liberals I don't
[3:36:14.920 --> 3:36:21.480]  know it's it's maybe just in my life it's been skewed but you know you got
[3:36:21.480 --> 3:36:26.520]  white guys and black guys attacking a black guy calling him a inward the very
[3:36:26.520 --> 3:36:31.160]  racial derogatory term clearly and then the media is saying that it's the tea
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:34.520]  parties or anybody that doesn't want cap and trade or anybody that doesn't want
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:38.080]  socialist health care or anybody that I want to turn their guns in that we're
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:41.800]  all Ku Klux Klan members it doesn't matter how many black or Hispanic or
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:45.680]  Asians come out to these events as well this this could really blow up in the
[3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:51.840]  establishment's face yeah I'm I see your point I'm not here to espouse any
[3:36:51.840 --> 3:37:01.640]  particular political opinion I'm here to represent Mr. Gladney it seems it
[3:37:01.640 --> 3:37:09.200]  seems odd that that these individuals were acting as mayor in the first place
[3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:15.380]  though it remains to be seen whether they were acting at the behest of certain
[3:37:15.380 --> 3:37:22.600]  democratic organizations or or even the Carnahan people well let me ask you a
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:26.920]  question what are you planning to do about this I know your client has been
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:30.520]  at the hospital is he out of the hospital yet yeah he's out of the
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:36.240]  hospital he's still from his injuries he's still quite a bit of pain we're
[3:37:36.240 --> 3:37:43.120]  we're pursuing a legal action in the near future against I guess the end of
[3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:47.680]  and the union and possibly some other parties but that you know that that's
[3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:52.360]  legal plan remain to be well the videos we've got from different angles show
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:57.160]  them only letting the union people in and keeping anybody else out though this
[3:37:57.160 --> 3:38:01.920]  was advertised as a public meeting and it appears that they were using the union
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:06.960]  thugs to go after people I don't know if you saw it in st. Louis TV I've seen it
[3:38:06.960 --> 3:38:11.000]  on the internet and it looked as though they were given preferential treatment
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:17.680]  I've heard of some reports in Tampa of them shipping in these rena union slash
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:24.440]  thug so you know it wouldn't surprise me if these were rent a thug but that
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:28.080]  remains to be seen and if they were there there would be there's a lot more
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:31.920]  questions to be answered on the other part of a representative carnyan and
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:38.720]  and and the people well Obama is setting up these youth brigades in st. Louis
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:41.800]  during the campaign I don't know if you saw it but they ran the video with
[3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:45.280]  police on the news saying if we don't like what you say about Obama we're
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:50.840]  gonna arrest you I mean this is getting very brown shirt I mean they're
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:54.760]  screaming inward there they're beating political people up this sounds like
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:39:01.440]  Nazi Germany once again I'm Alex as much as I have opinions I'm here to
[3:39:01.440 --> 3:39:06.680]  represent Kenneth Kenneth may have more of an opinion on this than I do just
[3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:10.680]  not my place in and I would like to invite you and Kenneth on the Sunday
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:15.560]  syndicated show so we're gonna call you later today after you're on TV and or
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:19.600]  over Saturday and and see about getting you and Kenneth on but how is Kenneth
[3:39:19.600 --> 3:39:25.240]  taking this being punched in the face kicked on the ground stomped on I mean
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:29.400]  brutally assaulted it looks like he's like stunned on the video that he
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:34.360]  couldn't imagine I mean this is just outrageous well I'm looking at Kenneth
[3:39:34.360 --> 3:39:37.200]  right now he's having a lot of difficulties is getting out of SUV right
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:41.120]  now to go over to these uh interview over to Fox we're doing right now he's in a
[3:39:41.120 --> 3:39:47.480]  lot of pain emotionally it's very upsetting to him that he's just he's an
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:39:52.080]  ordinary guy a lot of people try to paint in some news reports we see try to
[3:39:52.080 --> 3:39:56.600]  paint Kenneth as a conservative activist which is the spot is for the truth
[3:39:56.600 --> 3:40:01.600]  he's an independent ordinary guy that thrusts into an extraordinary set of
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:08.320]  circumstances here he he expressed to me that he doesn't know they fit in the
[3:40:08.320 --> 3:40:12.440]  left-right paradigm it's not about the Democrats it's not about the Republicans
[3:40:12.440 --> 3:40:17.400]  with him he's just a regular man that has just enjoyed liberty and that's
[3:40:17.400 --> 3:40:20.840]  the most important thing to him is liberty let me take a wild guess if
[3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:27.720]  you're a listener is your is your client a listener I haven't asked so maybe
[3:40:27.720 --> 3:40:31.040]  after today you will be if not already when I was just I coined the whole
[3:40:31.040 --> 3:40:35.000]  left-right paradigm situation I'm glad to see that breaking I've been to tea
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:39.240]  parties and events and the people just want freedom they know government if
[3:40:39.240 --> 3:40:43.560]  the government couldn't read the 1300 page bill how are they gonna implement
[3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:47.440]  the bill you know that's what's so incredible we don't want cap and trade we
[3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:51.720]  don't want to pay double for our energy and we're not racist we're not bad and
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:55.920]  to have him yelling inward and punching him in the nose and tackling him it's
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:41:00.040]  just outrageous I want you to get to your interview and get to Kenneth while
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:05.160]  he's with the media but in 60 seconds sir finish up just any other key points
[3:41:05.160 --> 3:41:14.160]  about this event well you know it I think the tragedy here is that yeah that our
[3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:18.880]  country has kind of gone down to a gone down a road that we may never ever
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:25.560]  come back from where we're people are scared into silence where the freedom of
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:29.160]  expression which is you know our basic First Amendment fundamental right is
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:35.880]  being trampled upon and stifled by by individuals who who don't have the art
[3:41:35.880 --> 3:41:41.160]  best interest at heart it was kind of telling the mentality of one of
[3:41:41.160 --> 3:41:45.840]  individuals if you see it on on the on YouTube or one of these videos is
[3:41:45.840 --> 3:41:50.240]  floating around virally they say well what why did why did you what an
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:54.400]  individual says to one of the attackers he says why did you attack him and they
[3:41:54.400 --> 3:41:58.840]  said because he's attacking America and Kenneth is far the strength thing from
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:03.960]  attacking America Kenneth is a is a respectable husband he's a good member
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:08.440]  of the community he's not affiliated with any party this is not astroturf here
[3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:12.840]  this is an ordinary man once again thrust into an extraordinary set of
[3:42:12.840 --> 3:42:16.520]  circumstances and there's a lot of questions that yet to be answered enough
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:19.880]  and then that's what we said we're setting about to do is to get these
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:25.320]  questions answered well he's been demonized and we've all been demonized
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:29.000]  and that's what there's there's a lot of things going around there just totally laughable they
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:34.400]  got the wrong pictures of him on the internet then just just hogwash really
[3:42:34.400 --> 3:42:39.160]  basically that's what political goons do is they dehumanize you by saying you're
[3:42:39.160 --> 3:42:41.960]  hurting America then go after you I'm gonna I'm gonna let you go we're gonna
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:44.640]  call you back about getting you and Kenneth on Sunday I'm gonna put you on
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:48.360]  hold right now though and see if my producers can set something up right
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:52.120]  now let you get back thank you so much I'll call you a little bit I gotta take
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:42:56.280]  his call though okay thank you so much mr. Brown take care all right there he
[3:42:56.280 --> 3:43:00.600]  goes we're gonna get him in Kenneth on the Sunday show four to six p.m. central
[3:43:00.600 --> 3:43:05.800]  standard time man if I had like 20 30 guys
[3:43:05.800 --> 3:43:10.480]  blowing up to me that's when the Hulk comes out folks I don't mean Hulk Hogan
[3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:14.000]  I mean and I'm not claiming I'm some tough guy but when a bunch when a cup
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:20.880]  bunch of people start facing me down I go into primitive mode and look out just
[3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:25.640]  look out this guy was very restrained after they viciously attacked him I
[3:43:25.640 --> 3:43:30.680]  would have gone completely wild I mean it would have been you know because I'm
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:33.320]  not looking for trouble I don't want to get in the fight I've been in the
[3:43:33.320 --> 3:43:36.360]  hospital for three days with a concussion where I couldn't see I've had a
[3:43:36.360 --> 3:43:40.640]  bone sticking out of my leg I've broken bones you know I've been knocked out by
[3:43:40.640 --> 3:43:44.400]  the best of them thank God I grew out of that me you know I'm in my you know
[3:43:44.400 --> 3:43:50.600]  teenage years but I you know I just I just I've put up with stuff of political
[3:43:50.600 --> 3:43:53.600]  events with Democrats and Republicans hit me on the head with signs and look
[3:43:53.600 --> 3:43:57.680]  poking me and grabbing our bullhorn and punching me in the stomach and so I guess
[3:43:57.680 --> 3:44:04.920]  I've actually grown up and taken it so I guess I did what Kenneth did and put up
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:08.920]  with it though there's the footage of them assaulting me at MSNBC I'm out
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:14.000]  there in the crowd and they start attacking me and but see they punch
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:17.400]  me in the back and then run off it wasn't like ten guys in front of me going
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:21.680]  come on because that would just be like I mean I just it's that primitive level
[3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:26.400]  it's just I mean I'm sure a lot of you experienced you're like rather than ten
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:30.000]  guys scaring you you just want to like to start savaging I don't know how to
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:34.800]  explain it but sounds like vacation actually I'm just joking around I'm
[3:44:34.800 --> 3:44:38.960]  just acting tough I'm actually a big wimp I'm just joking it's crazy point is
[3:44:38.960 --> 3:44:48.000]  I don't know how he controlled himself here is my only point but I want to take
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:53.440]  some phone calls 1-800-259-9031 I'll hit a few final news stories here in the
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:58.240]  final segment that is coming up right now let's go to John and Ohio John you're
[3:44:58.240 --> 3:45:04.800]  on the air yeah Alex are you thinking of having someone on from my black agenda
[3:45:04.800 --> 3:45:09.400]  report.com yes I want to get the black agenda report.com on I've seen their
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:13.600]  material and John you're always calling in to chastise me let me guess I'm going
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:19.960]  to be spanked for having Dr. Jerome Corsi on earlier yeah because like I
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:26.920]  heard Webster Tarkley point out Obama just loves these these attacks from the
[3:45:26.920 --> 3:45:31.840]  ultra ultra right the the people who support the same kind of warm mongering
[3:45:31.840 --> 3:45:36.240]  attacks and propaganda saber rattling against Iraq Iran against the
[3:45:36.240 --> 3:45:41.200]  Palestinians people like this this Zionist Jerome Corsi agent the CIA
[3:45:41.200 --> 3:45:46.960]  agent because it makes him look like somehow he's kind of a progressive he's
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:51.480]  a he's completely mobbed up with the same Zionist people in his own
[3:45:51.480 --> 3:45:57.120]  administration the same military industrial types that Jerome Corsi
[3:45:57.120 --> 3:46:03.360]  represents and so what as a Webster Tarkley said he's definitely afraid of any
[3:46:03.360 --> 3:46:08.040]  attack from the left and I'm not hearing this from John John I appreciate
[3:46:08.040 --> 3:46:10.760]  your call I knew what you were gonna say that's why I went to you first I
[3:46:10.760 --> 3:46:14.840]  figured you disagreed we had him on about the North American Union about the
[3:46:14.840 --> 3:46:18.080]  birth certificate stuff and I've had huge arguments with him about his Iran
[3:46:18.080 --> 3:46:23.960]  situation and what happens is we have him on and then all these mainline
[3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:29.120]  conservatives tune in and then we deprogram so I wouldn't I wouldn't miss
[3:46:29.120 --> 3:46:34.120]  the mouse for the cheese you know we're here deprogramming people in mass we have
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:37.800]  a lot of different points of view and perspectives on you know just because I
[3:46:37.800 --> 3:46:41.160]  have astronauts on doesn't mean that I believe that everything they're saying
[3:46:41.160 --> 3:46:46.160]  about the moon landings is true but I'm forming relationships with them so I can
[3:46:46.160 --> 3:46:52.200]  get more info I'm here to shadow the left-right paradigm okay so this isn't
[3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:55.880]  some orthodoxy where we have one thing here on the show like we had a medical
[3:46:55.880 --> 3:46:59.040]  doctor on who I disagree with almost everything he said about the flu yesterday
[3:46:59.040 --> 3:47:02.160]  but I said I'm gonna have different perspectives on so the listeners can
[3:47:02.160 --> 3:47:07.880]  make up their mind this is not some cult here you know this is not everything I
[3:47:07.880 --> 3:47:13.640]  believe and that's the end of it and believe me I I joked in the first hour
[3:47:13.640 --> 3:47:18.480]  about course you keep your friends close and the operatives closer I mean of
[3:47:18.480 --> 3:47:21.600]  course he's something else man but I appreciate his work on the North
[3:47:21.600 --> 3:47:26.840]  American Union he does represent a faction of people that were against Bush
[3:47:26.840 --> 3:47:31.560]  for that so and he came out for 9-11 truth a little bit and got ground for
[3:47:31.560 --> 3:47:36.440]  that and backed off Ronnie in Texas Ronnie go ahead thank you sir here's a
[3:47:36.440 --> 3:47:39.680]  different perspective on how to cancel the IRS I was hoping to share with Bob
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:43.080]  Chapman the unconstitutional never fully ratified
[3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:51.680]  RZX-Q09 a little liberator form with an overall all caps letter with an all-fringe flag and the
[3:47:51.680 --> 3:47:56.240]  Tweedledee I'm not gonna be sarcastic go ahead and tell me I'm sorry we can save
[3:47:56.240 --> 3:48:00.800]  family farms also and take money away from big farmer help them the truly
[3:48:00.800 --> 3:48:05.520]  help people and that is by with freedom to kill the criminals biggest cash cow
[3:48:05.520 --> 3:48:09.840]  with absolute freedom for farmers to grow hemp marijuana be with George
[3:48:09.840 --> 3:48:13.640]  Washington Thomas Jefferson the other family fathers were also I thought you
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:16.880]  were gonna say there was some special trust we could sign and the feds would
[3:48:16.880 --> 3:48:21.800]  all go away so politically changing it no no I agree hemp is better than cotton
[3:48:21.800 --> 3:48:26.600]  it's better for platin plastics that's why they shut it down was gel chemical
[3:48:26.600 --> 3:48:32.160]  and DuPont on record had it demonized and and finance reefer madness and they
[3:48:32.160 --> 3:48:36.280]  made crazy movies were midgets start drinking blood and turn into vampires
[3:48:36.280 --> 3:48:40.520]  when they smoke it and all the old ladies believed it and banned it even
[3:48:40.520 --> 3:48:45.120]  though hundreds of varieties have no THC they're banned to also we could destroy
[3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:49.080]  American farmers George Washington raised hemp so it's got to be banned
[3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:53.840]  because George Washington's anti-American traditional water it's it's
[3:48:53.840 --> 3:49:00.440]  American yeah oh yeah traditional conservatism a lot Dr. Ron Paul demands
[3:49:00.440 --> 3:49:04.800]  total freedom for farmers and then we can save topsoil because we won't have to
[3:49:04.800 --> 3:49:08.040]  be cutting down all those trees to make paper and fiber we've got to go along
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:12.040]  with Obama and shut down all the farms and ranches with the national ID and
[3:49:12.040 --> 3:49:16.080]  premises ID it's the good thing to do for the earth I appreciate your call
[3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:22.200]  Ronnie Tom and Missouri are on the air go ahead great to talk with you I'm
[3:49:22.200 --> 3:49:26.400]  inspired by you are quite a bit I wanted to report to you a little bit off of
[3:49:26.400 --> 3:49:33.320]  the Carnahan story and I called there three days ago and talked with his
[3:49:33.320 --> 3:49:38.520]  staff trying to get information about town hall meetings and they said they
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:42.280]  had nothing scheduled so we're being derailed of our constitutional rights
[3:49:42.280 --> 3:49:47.680]  by calling into our congressman's office I call you know all these
[3:49:47.680 --> 3:49:51.560]  congressmen Republican and Democrat they only tell their supporters about
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:56.840]  these meetings to stage media events to make it look like everybody buying it
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:49:59.720]  but then even their own people are grabbing them so now they've got to have
[3:49:59.720 --> 3:50:04.160]  thugs to enforce well they denied they had anything scheduled and he passed me
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:07.720]  off without the number to a st. Louis congressional office I called there they
[3:50:07.720 --> 3:50:11.560]  also denied that he had any town hall meeting scheduled and that was less
[3:50:11.560 --> 3:50:16.720]  than 48 hours before yeah news hit the paper what you've got to do is there are
[3:50:16.720 --> 3:50:20.160]  a lot of disgruntled Democrats and Republicans who get these letters and
[3:50:20.160 --> 3:50:25.920]  people got a posted on Facebook and YouTube and and and my space where
