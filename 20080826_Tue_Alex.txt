[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:23.400]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we are locked and
[00:23.400 --> 00:30.440]  loaded today August 26 2008 not only from the command center here in Austin
[00:30.440 --> 00:35.480]  Texas with me Jason Burma is filling in for Alex Jones but Alex Jones himself over
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.760]  at the DNC and and it's been electrifying if you're not over at info wars dot com
[00:40.760 --> 00:44.440]  number one we are have been doing revolutionary radio now this will be the
[00:44.440 --> 00:50.360]  second day of it live reports from Justin dot TV where Alex is down at the DNC
[00:50.360 --> 00:54.600]  with the protesters at the detention camps now after the show later on they
[00:54.600 --> 00:57.960]  ran into Michelle Malcolm we're gonna be playing that very very soon crazy
[00:57.960 --> 01:02.480]  confrontation Alex tells it likes it like it is I mean he didn't he didn't give
[01:02.480 --> 01:08.080]  her a chance not that she deserves one I mean from a neocon fascist personally
[01:08.080 --> 01:13.280]  my favorite remarks are here are the ones about her dark soul and how her makeup
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.720]  cannot hide that fact but in my opinion it's nine minutes of pure gold when I
[01:17.720 --> 01:21.960]  watched this last night I didn't really know about it because the power went out
[01:21.960 --> 01:25.480]  in a in a section of Austin I guess all the local people listening will know
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.320]  what I'm talking about up up past Ulthorff so you know there was no modem no
[01:30.320 --> 01:37.640]  internet I was kind of out of loop for a while I called up Rob Jacobson after the
[01:37.640 --> 01:41.560]  very successful event last night at the Oriental Theater where Alex Jones showed
[01:41.560 --> 01:45.320]  truth rising you can get that not only chronicles truth rising over info wars
[01:45.320 --> 01:49.960]  comm right now if you'd like and he said yeah we went we went we saw Malcolm it
[01:49.960 --> 01:54.480]  was crazy so immediately I went to my computer and watched it and this is why
[01:54.480 --> 02:01.240]  I am so glad to be sitting in this seat I feel lucky I feel honored to be able to
[02:01.240 --> 02:06.840]  sit here and sit in for Jones because he doesn't pull any punches you know there's
[02:06.840 --> 02:11.640]  25 people around and they know who he is they know the message then these goons
[02:11.640 --> 02:17.000]  these two punks off man I'd like to they deserve a backhand these two punks
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.880]  wearing like berets the classic leftist douche baggery if you will I mean
[02:22.880 --> 02:26.640]  they're just you know punks and they act like they're Jones's friend and then
[02:26.640 --> 02:30.720]  they're yelling that he's a fascist and you know Jones seems to think they're
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.680]  neocon bloggers well there's an article out right now and you can go check it out
[02:35.680 --> 02:40.080]  at prismplanet.com and info wars.com of course remember the live stream is

[02:46.080 --> 02:50.880]  we're going to play the Jones-Malcolm confrontation for you there's stories
[02:50.880 --> 02:55.640]  about that also at info wars.com but DNC mint doesn't levitate protose
[02:55.640 --> 03:00.360]  protester shouts down journalist now they're trying to make all these people

[03:04.840 --> 03:10.440]  know the crunchy granola types now here's the recreate 68 part of course
[03:10.440 --> 03:13.840]  recreate 68 has been nothing but a nuisance I was watching MSNBC today
[03:13.840 --> 03:17.720]  and it's these anarchists guys wake up you're not doing anything productive
[03:17.720 --> 03:21.000]  they're wearing their masks they're blocking off the cops the cops have been
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.040]  pretty restrained even Jones was saying this morning I mean again if you're if
[03:24.040 --> 03:27.960]  you're up early enough you could have watched Jones on Peter Boyles I'm not
[03:27.960 --> 03:30.680]  sure how long that interview lasted I was getting ready to go in for the show
[03:30.680 --> 03:36.040]  but I watched a little bit of it and he was actually complimenting the police
[03:36.040 --> 03:39.960]  saying they've been the ones that are been restrained it's recreate 68 that
[03:39.960 --> 03:42.720]  has tried to provocateur things and from what I've seen yes I mean they're the
[03:42.720 --> 03:46.280]  ones that are acting like idiots yes they they have the right to peacefully
[03:46.280 --> 03:50.200]  protest to march without a permit but they're sitting down on the street
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.760]  they're not marching they're trying to cause disruption okay recreate 68 even
[03:54.760 --> 03:58.760]  through plastic quarters into the crowd ooh plastic quarters perhaps hoping to
[03:58.760 --> 04:02.120]  preempt the real money that they soon hope to be covering the block
[04:02.120 --> 04:06.760]  unbelievable take money from the war give it back to the poor shout of the
[04:06.760 --> 04:09.160]  crowd
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.400]  is there these people are lost folks
[04:15.400 --> 04:18.920]  all right so here we go but soon the attention was diverted from the peaceful
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.240]  protest by an altercation between a member of the conservative media and a
[04:23.240 --> 04:26.840]  citizen attending the protest this was the second incident of its kind on
[04:26.840 --> 04:30.520]  sunday protesters took exception to a fox news reporter trying to question war
[04:30.520 --> 04:35.000]  Churchill controversial see war Churchill wasn't even there at the time

[09:31.640 --> 09:35.480]  just talk about in general because i know you can talk a lot about
[09:35.480 --> 09:40.120]  nine olympic staging of events and you said you were coming here
[09:40.120 --> 09:46.920]  because you wanted to uh film and be sure that you get a record if in fact
[09:46.920 --> 09:54.200]  police tried to implant provocateurs in order to justify police action
[09:54.200 --> 09:58.680]  we're not really finding that no in fact i don't come you know to an event
[09:58.680 --> 10:01.960]  and i'm at the mini pre-conceived i go to report
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.360]  the fact that you thought that you may find some what we're calling provocateurs
[10:06.360 --> 10:09.320]  being uh actual factions of the governor
[10:09.320 --> 10:13.240]  i said that on your show last week you say that that from time to time
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.160]  they will do that on purpose to give them justification for police action
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.360]  exactly let's be clear i have never come to general better may
[10:20.360 --> 10:23.000]  tell us i've never come here to cover a big political
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.680]  event especially a huge actual street event like this one we have covered
[10:26.680 --> 10:30.600]  canada we have covered austin texas for portion five hundred we have covered
[10:30.600 --> 10:33.560]  seattle now i've covered many other events just
[10:33.560 --> 10:36.040]  earlier this year they had the security prosperity partnership
[10:36.040 --> 10:39.480]  north america the union summit in ottawa and montavello
[10:39.480 --> 10:42.920]  and uh some of our camera folks and the activists up there caught police
[10:42.920 --> 10:45.880]  dressed up like the anarchists attacking police for these cameras so they
[10:45.880 --> 10:48.600]  could dim rubber bullets attack the peaceful crowd we said look the same
[10:48.600 --> 10:53.080]  way to get rid of protest but but but then it came out the cbc and the police
[10:53.080 --> 10:57.160]  have admitted it was federal police so they're on record cbc all the canadian
[10:57.160 --> 11:00.520]  papers literally all of them the police had to apologize so we're watching an
[11:00.520 --> 11:04.360]  investigation from the top now in the case of a fortune five hundred
[11:04.360 --> 11:07.480]  they had in austin nice nine nine there were these huge cops they worked a
[11:07.480 --> 11:11.160]  little method uh you know uh dirty leg anarchist
[11:11.160 --> 11:13.800]  running around you could tell they were cops starting fights i went up to them
[11:13.800 --> 11:16.920]  said stop it officers also police ran across said stop it
[11:16.920 --> 11:20.600]  jones and then we backed them off there so my own town the cops tried it
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.040]  and so we've seen this in england we've seen this other places so i came in
[11:24.040 --> 11:27.320]  here saying well i've seen it happen we've covered it
[11:27.320 --> 11:29.480]  we'll see what happens here well i have to say
[11:29.480 --> 11:32.840]  whoever i've been in all these videos have never beaten people up and
[11:32.840 --> 11:36.760]  you know i've criticized those but i have to say very professional police
[11:36.760 --> 11:40.680]  very nice they put a lot of crap in the anarchists yeah they did they did
[11:40.680 --> 11:43.640]  they're actually showing restraint they're showing a lot of restraint now
[11:43.640 --> 11:47.400]  this is from a guy who loves criticizing oh i'll do it the minute if i need
[11:47.400 --> 11:50.760]  to be criticized but i don't and i don't have a major role he's very organized
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.600]  they're very and and i heard they were polite they were well mannered they were
[11:54.600 --> 11:57.640]  organized they're not they don't have it you trigger feeders
[11:57.640 --> 12:01.480]  now they're very restrained what's the anarchist doing i don't know i don't
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.280]  ask them a quick question would you be upset if you lived with city and it
[12:04.280 --> 12:07.560]  wasn't an incident i mean oh no i don't know but but for
[12:07.560 --> 12:10.920]  happenings there's a lot of the anarchists because because the reason
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.320]  mike's asking that is what work events that a lot of the protesters they say
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.960]  oh you know we're totally not fine not true i i know that i know that they
[12:19.960 --> 12:24.040]  want to make a name for themselves and they want no we just want to report
[12:24.040 --> 12:27.560]  but i'm not talking about you i'm talking about us i'm talking about
[12:27.560 --> 12:30.360]  he was asking if i would be upset right i was answering his question now let's talk
[12:30.360 --> 12:34.680]  about recreate 68 because i believe spagnol is a publicity whore
[12:34.680 --> 12:38.200]  i believe well they act like foundation funded limousine liberals who are there
[12:38.200 --> 12:42.600]  to make demonstrators who have no passion he's never listen to this and
[12:42.600 --> 12:45.800]  they're in clown suits wizard outfits i don't think we're going to levitate
[12:45.800 --> 12:48.680]  which they know is going to fail which makes them by the way clowns
[12:48.680 --> 12:51.880]  some of them are dressed like harry potter and gestures and then he's
[12:51.880 --> 12:56.040]  scheduled to defend himself when i protested in the 60s and 70s
[12:56.040 --> 13:00.280]  i'm a bit older than you you want one big one and then or or but he is scheduled
[13:00.280 --> 13:03.720]  to tell people what we're going to be and another thing we didn't do is we got
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.400]  to get on a radio show like he does for an hour or two we talk about our issues
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.000]  exactly you don't talk about yourself hey we're against the war we're against the
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.600]  secret courts or we're against the camps we're against the war was wiretapping
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.200]  instead it's we're clowns we're the best we're not talking about
[13:18.200 --> 13:22.360]  he's talking about himself he's talking about his group he's talking about his cocktail parties
[13:22.360 --> 13:26.600]  and pedicures and i know he's bragging about look it's all about their personal
[13:26.600 --> 13:30.040]  power trip how they get to meet the tolly with people and how they get to go
[13:30.040 --> 13:32.600]  meet shawntan but let me tell you what they've done to us
[13:32.600 --> 13:37.000]  okay it's incredible it's incredible it's all on video i want you they claim
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.160]  that they're totally peaceful and you they're rabid animals you work
[13:41.160 --> 13:46.600]  inciting they claim you work inciting police in order to get good video okay
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.680]  here's the deal okay what happened let me just give you a quick rundown we show
[13:50.680 --> 13:53.640]  up sunday we go out film some of the demonstrations
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.080]  they're out there running up flashing with police in other cities the police
[13:57.080 --> 14:01.160]  were clobbering them the police stood back and just basically let them
[14:01.160 --> 14:04.440]  run into them bump into them get aggressive it was all over the news
[14:04.440 --> 14:09.880]  and so then we go out monday morning and by about 11 a.m we go out to the federal
[14:09.880 --> 14:13.800]  courthouse and we're live video feeds to info wars
[14:13.800 --> 14:16.840]  so i thought this is a fun video yeah it's it's live video feed like we are
[14:16.840 --> 14:22.280]  right now on info wars dot com of you but also it's archived there it would save
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.120]  after we cut the feed it's been archived for you the camera doesn't line
[14:26.120 --> 14:29.000]  there it is so this is the great equalizer
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.120]  ward church hill the guy that said that everybody was at all bite-mans and
[14:32.120 --> 14:37.720]  deserve to die in the towers the daycare kids the
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.440]  secretaries the food preparer the wife says
[14:42.440 --> 14:46.600]  they're there erin just walks over nicely erin they don't know who he is
[14:46.600 --> 14:49.960]  erin walks over while i'm interviewing someone else very quietly because i'm
[14:49.960 --> 14:53.080]  making a film you know i'm making a film i've
[14:53.080 --> 14:55.400]  been making a film for several years about the police state so i've been to a
[14:55.400 --> 14:58.200]  bunch of other events in our film we're gonna show they were restrained unless
[14:58.200 --> 15:01.400]  something else happens the police the next few days we tell the truth you know
[15:01.400 --> 15:05.320]  it's similar to him he walks up to work he walks up and says i would like to
[15:05.320 --> 15:08.680]  have an interview and they just start saying we're not violent
[15:08.680 --> 15:11.400]  we're not violent just slapping and hitting the
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.880]  ten thousand dollar camera so so they're just nobody basically doesn't
[15:15.880 --> 15:19.000]  work around methamphetamines and doesn't have tattoos all over them and
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.040]  devil tattoos and i'm not even bashing those people the point is
[15:22.040 --> 15:25.320]  he didn't look right for bigoted their clothes minded it's on video they go
[15:25.320 --> 15:28.920]  after him now i'm over here and i'm just interviewing
[15:28.920 --> 15:31.960]  some of our business and i got bandana so i'm like why are you here
[15:31.960 --> 15:35.160]  and they're talking to us and it's all right let's uh let's cut it and go back
[15:35.160 --> 15:37.800]  to some uh some news and then we're going to go back to the malcon clip
[15:37.800 --> 15:40.280]  because he just talked about war Churchill and i ended the segment with
[15:40.280 --> 15:44.040]  war Churchill before we cut out a little bit and there's another article that
[15:44.040 --> 15:47.240]  is trying to say that alex is a racist it's in the gazette.com they're
[15:47.240 --> 15:51.160]  trying to call him a white populist again they're trying to associate him
[15:51.160 --> 15:54.200]  with war Churchill here as well we'll get into that article but i want to read
[15:54.200 --> 15:57.640]  this one now first of all uh mark cohen who is the
[15:57.640 --> 16:00.920]  co-founder of recreate 68 is a total goon look
[16:00.920 --> 16:05.320]  i dressed up in robes i mean come on
[16:05.320 --> 16:08.440]  give me a break and then in the background of the picture on the dnc
[16:08.440 --> 16:12.520]  mint article is a gentleman who alex did get an altercation with
[16:12.520 --> 16:16.840]  uh during the malcon confrontation which we're going to play a segment of
[16:16.840 --> 16:21.560]  uh of probably in the next minute or so but alex actually talked to him this
[16:21.560 --> 16:25.080]  morning and he had no idea that malcon was bill o'reilly's host this guy was
[16:25.080 --> 16:28.040]  totally out of it has no idea what's going on in the world
[16:28.040 --> 16:30.840]  and they made up and made friends so that was
[16:30.840 --> 16:34.360]  pretty interesting but let's uh let's read the quote
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.400]  okay first of all uh fox news reporter trying to question war Churchill
[16:39.400 --> 16:42.440]  no she was not trying to question michelle malcon was not
[16:42.440 --> 16:46.120]  trying to question your war Churchill what she was doing was taking pictures
[16:46.120 --> 16:51.080]  of the demonstrators the anarchists the the ones with no purpose the ones that
[16:51.080 --> 16:54.600]  have no idea about geopolitics they think everything is black and white
[16:54.600 --> 16:57.800]  they do really honestly believe anarchy is going to work
[16:57.800 --> 17:01.640]  come on get with it that's not a real system
[17:01.640 --> 17:05.560]  it's not a system at all so of course today it was
[17:05.560 --> 17:09.000]  radical alex jones from the group 911 truth which believes that the
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.120]  september 11 terrorist attacks were planned by the u.s. government verbally
[17:12.120 --> 17:16.280]  confronting malcon a conservative columnist and fox news contributor
[17:16.280 --> 17:19.640]  more than a fox news contributor she's the she's the host for o'reilly when he's
[17:19.640 --> 17:22.920]  out okay she's on all the time she lies about
[17:22.920 --> 17:27.320]  you know us she lies about a lot of things it makes me sick
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.400]  wow he said recreate 68s
[17:31.400 --> 17:34.600]  sanchez who pushed his way into the crowd of tv cameras
[17:34.600 --> 17:38.200]  to yell at jones said michelle malcon is a true patriot
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.680]  and alex jones of course uh glenn spagnolo said that
[17:42.680 --> 17:47.560]  he's the true agent provocateur no alex has a style of confrontation with these
[17:47.560 --> 17:51.480]  people which is no nonsense and not going to back down
[17:51.480 --> 17:54.440]  but you know they again they try to portray him as a racist look you show me
[17:54.440 --> 17:58.040]  one racist thing alex jones has ever done and don't give you that
[17:58.040 --> 18:02.120]  mexophobia crap okay no one has anything against
[18:02.120 --> 18:05.960]  mexicans here we have a problem with our economy
[18:05.960 --> 18:09.720]  being taken over by a north american union
[18:09.720 --> 18:13.640]  by devaluing the dollar putting it on parody with the canadian dollar
[18:13.640 --> 18:17.000]  and then bringing up the peso as you let all sorts of illegals come into this
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.240]  country because you want a one conglomerate north american
[18:21.240 --> 18:24.600]  union that's what we're against make no mistake about it
[18:24.600 --> 18:28.360]  i could care less what the color your skin is and and so could alex
[18:28.360 --> 18:31.240]  uh... well we'll get into that article in the next segment
[18:31.240 --> 18:36.200]  let's uh... let's go to malcon v jones right now

[33:22.360 --> 33:25.320]  all right i'm going to take a couple calls and then i'm going to go out to uh
[33:25.320 --> 33:28.520]  alex at the dnc on the tom martino show looks like they're talking about the
[33:28.520 --> 33:32.600]  miss wtc seven report but uh... let's go to let's take one caller before then
[33:32.600 --> 33:37.560]  let's go to david in canada david what's on your mind
[33:37.560 --> 33:40.360]  david you know about that that's all right switching over from the speaker
[33:40.360 --> 33:43.160]  phone are you doing a great job thank you man
[33:43.160 --> 33:47.080]  uh... i just have one you know caution i guess and then sort of something to
[33:47.080 --> 33:50.600]  throw out there for people to chew on a little bit
[33:50.600 --> 33:54.280]  i followed alex's work for five six years and sure
[33:54.280 --> 33:57.160]  initially it was a big quite a big shock you know
[33:57.160 --> 34:01.160]  some of the stuff that was revealed but as he points out
[34:01.160 --> 34:05.720]  over time you become you know somewhat desensitized even the most egregious
[34:05.720 --> 34:09.320]  stuff that they're trying to pull right sure and uh... we also
[34:09.320 --> 34:13.320]  haven't seemed on some levels to have slowed up
[34:13.320 --> 34:16.440]  their progress in other words a lot of these agendas
[34:16.440 --> 34:20.360]  that you know have been uh revealed to people and and people are sort of
[34:20.360 --> 34:23.320]  woken up to you they're still going ahead with regardless
[34:23.320 --> 34:27.720]  right yeah absolutely one of the things i want to throw out of the proviso is
[34:27.720 --> 34:32.040]  as a group and as a community and i use those words loosely
[34:32.040 --> 34:35.400]  we we need to start talking a little bit more about
[34:35.400 --> 34:39.160]  where it is we want to go and and what the next phase
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.760]  of this quote unquote revolution is going to be sure you well i let me tell
[34:42.760 --> 34:46.360]  you what i think the next phase of this revolution should be i mean ron paul
[34:46.360 --> 34:49.960]  uh... you know is having his alternate convention he's also starting his own
[34:49.960 --> 34:52.360]  group to try to get people into local politics
[34:52.360 --> 34:55.720]  that your city council member that your state senator if you're if you're man
[34:55.720 --> 34:58.200]  enough if you're up for you think you can win a congressional seat that's the
[34:58.200 --> 35:01.080]  way to go we have to get good people in into uh
[35:01.080 --> 35:03.640]  congress into your state senate in the local government
[35:03.640 --> 35:06.600]  i mean if we could go governor that'd be great if we go senate that'd be even
[35:06.600 --> 35:09.880]  actual senate that'd be even better but we have to start small and start
[35:09.880 --> 35:14.120]  somewhere and really be a voice at these meetings and if if we have people
[35:14.120 --> 35:18.360]  that don't cow down to quote unquote special interest groups
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.480]  then i think that we have a better shot i thank you for the call man i mean i
[35:21.480 --> 35:23.400]  think that's gotta be the next step
[35:23.400 --> 35:27.960]  i mean for me my my next step is you know doing radio and movies
[35:27.960 --> 35:30.760]  uh... to wake other people up and hopefully other people can use their
[35:30.760 --> 35:32.200]  talents
[35:32.200 --> 35:35.640]  in the political arena i mean i'm not saying that i'm opposed maybe five
[35:35.640 --> 35:38.440]  ten years down the line to get into politics but i
[35:38.440 --> 35:42.920]  hope it's somebody else i know it it's a it's a job that weighs on you heavily i
[35:42.920 --> 35:46.040]  know that and the temptation is right in front of you
[35:46.040 --> 35:49.960]  i mean ultimately we have to take the special interest out of politics
[35:49.960 --> 35:53.320]  they're on a uh... they're on a break over at martino show
[35:53.320 --> 35:55.560]  and they're still having problems with uh...
[35:55.560 --> 35:59.800]  with the fee for some reason but i am i'm getting it no problemo
[35:59.800 --> 36:03.400]  and you can check out the uh... live feed over info wars dot com right now
[36:03.400 --> 36:09.240]  we'll cut to that in a minute let's go to rebb in colorado rebb are you with us
[36:09.240 --> 36:12.600]  you there rebb yeah i'm right here you can hear us real good we're above a
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.040]  scout rebb we're here in other side of the river like with color a we caught
[36:16.040 --> 36:19.560]  some good things you want to hear about from the public broadcast
[36:19.560 --> 36:24.120]  they're idle ted the idiot turner in town
[36:24.120 --> 36:28.680]  and he's walking around going to the convention getting all the free food
[36:28.680 --> 36:31.800]  and everything and that means how i chain could be
[36:31.800 --> 36:36.040]  not too far behind but also public broadcast putting out the
[36:36.040 --> 36:40.760]  nation about some alleged plot against some
[36:40.760 --> 36:44.840]  candidate when they said they had rifles in there talking about the nancy
[36:44.840 --> 36:47.480]  polosi incident right the nancy polosi incident
[36:47.480 --> 36:51.320]  county and he said a envelope full of white powder
[36:51.320 --> 36:55.400]  and it went to a campaign headquarters that the kind of degeneracy of the
[36:55.400 --> 36:59.160]  public broadcasters in this area and apparently they can't even
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.800]  stir up the anticipated riots that they were trying to
[37:03.800 --> 37:07.000]  well they definitely failed on that and rebb i thank you for the call
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.800]  uh... yeah they didn't get the riots they wanted not enough people were fooled
[37:09.800 --> 37:13.320]  by recreate sixty eight okay you're not calling for violence you just have a
[37:13.320 --> 37:18.360]  shield book pdf up i mean it's it's ridiculousness
[37:18.360 --> 37:22.040]  give me a break i don't i don't even want to hear your lies i mean you got
[37:22.040 --> 37:25.960]  people in full gear right here and the plot he's talking about
[37:25.960 --> 37:29.080]  i don't know a lot about i just heard it on the mainstream media so
[37:29.080 --> 37:32.760]  you know take it with a ring of caution supposedly
[37:32.760 --> 37:37.240]  um... somebody was in the uh... same hotel
[37:37.240 --> 37:40.040]  as polosi and some other democrats and i think
[37:40.040 --> 37:44.760]  uh... polosi was uh... the main target apparently and they saw him walking in
[37:44.760 --> 37:48.840]  with rifles in his bag or you know rifle bags or whatever
[37:48.840 --> 37:52.520]  so he's been detained i don't know the full story on that one
[37:52.520 --> 37:55.560]  okay i'm not going to pretend to know the full story on that one i think people
[37:55.560 --> 37:58.760]  should look into it are there crazies out there yeah there are crazies out there
[37:58.760 --> 38:01.560]  i think the guy was like you know like twenty seven or twenty ninety was less
[38:01.560 --> 38:07.400]  than thirty all right let's go to kevin in missouri what's on your mind kevin

[40:13.160 --> 40:17.000]  tom martino
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.000]  i'll tell you what's even better i did get in here super fast masses of parking
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.400]  i literally got in there in 60 seconds
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.440]  and the security wasn't acting like everybody was all kind of you come off
[40:26.440 --> 40:32.520]  of a full of art and uh... go down to connor uh... full of art into uh...
[40:32.520 --> 40:35.080]  into the uh... that's what you're talking about
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.000]  i'm stating you just you just part they have a replica of the uh...
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.000]  oval office and they have uh... a replica of air force one and a lot of other
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.720]  stuff that's what's made the air force one
[40:45.720 --> 40:49.720]  now uh... that voice is alex james i invited you that's your conscious
[40:49.720 --> 40:52.520]  one i'm sorry i'm sorry you used to complain when i was hooked yes
[40:52.520 --> 40:55.960]  this is when parker went into you you don't have that problem
[40:55.960 --> 40:59.320]  no no we don't have that problem bill has a comment for alex
[40:59.320 --> 41:03.000]  alex has a lot of controversial stands on things but
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  obviously we came here expecting to see a lot of provocateurs in the crowd
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.440]  maybe even sponsored by police or others to give justice to people
[41:10.440 --> 41:14.120]  exactly he said the police in denigra were very organized for the life and
[41:14.120 --> 41:17.960]  buried on top of it and they were provoked by
[41:17.960 --> 41:21.960]  some of these idiotic protesters from recreate 68 and other groups who had no
[41:21.960 --> 41:25.160]  idea what they were protesting and just looking for publicity
[41:25.160 --> 41:29.480]  there was a technical there was one case last night after the riots
[41:29.480 --> 41:33.080]  two waves of them at 11 o'clock at night videotaping the police
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.160]  trying to drink apple juice and eat uh...
[41:37.160 --> 41:41.720]  nut bars and the guy walks over and he goes come on man we're working
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.160]  we're tired leave us alone and i just said hey we're working too and he said
[41:45.160 --> 41:48.760]  it's kind of mad at first he goes all right i'm from alaya originally
[41:48.760 --> 41:51.720]  paying loose you don't have austin cops doing that
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.240]  don't have new york cops doing that so i have to say now i have some of the
[41:55.240 --> 41:58.840]  bicyclists 20 feet away from here in kraken said that's wrong
[41:58.840 --> 42:02.200]  and then they lied and tried to say that what was it a few weeks ago do you see that
[42:02.200 --> 42:04.440]  footage no i heard about it of course i mean they're slamming
[42:04.440 --> 42:08.440]  him out what is the then they charged him with assaulting him that was wrong
[42:08.440 --> 42:11.240]  so i was trying to go in here actually scared of the cops a lot of people must be
[42:11.240 --> 42:14.920]  worse overall they've been really nice stand for police overall
[42:14.920 --> 42:17.880]  in fact we weighed that i mean they weighed back bill what did you start with
[42:17.880 --> 42:22.280]  you expected the next few days now from what you've seen do you expect more incidents
[42:22.280 --> 42:26.120]  well that's a thing i mean now the truce is ended with the
[42:26.120 --> 42:33.960]  self worship clown outfit recreate moron bill and so now i think they basically
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.200]  aren't going to be or or anarchists not affiliated with them by the hundreds
[42:38.200 --> 42:42.280]  they'll be running around like banshees uh but we're going to now be tracking them
[42:42.280 --> 42:46.360]  and trying to document what they're doing uh again we've caught other anarchist
[42:46.360 --> 42:49.240]  groups working for the feds i'm not saying all the anarchist groups do or all of
[42:49.240 --> 42:52.920]  the bad i just know a lot of them have been punching on me pushing on me
[42:52.920 --> 42:56.760]  attacking my cameraman and then squealing with you know hatred if you push them
[42:56.760 --> 43:00.920]  back and so yes i want to be the only person
[43:00.920 --> 43:03.640]  yeah they think i don't have your first good but that's it they think they
[43:03.640 --> 43:09.880]  can be protesting you know i'll be able to have a comment from alex go ahead
[43:09.880 --> 43:17.560]  a question go ahead

[43:28.120 --> 43:32.200]  leave you know be the passion and take action do it yourself i would just go
[43:32.200 --> 43:35.480]  ahead and make the film and do what i do i just put them out for free
[43:35.480 --> 43:40.520]  on the web and then people want a dvd how do you make a living now it's
[43:40.520 --> 43:44.680]  advertising in my radio show financed the films and the films usually after about
[43:44.680 --> 43:48.600]  a year you know people see something online they want to keep safe dvd
[43:48.600 --> 43:52.840]  they want to sign and so you know we sell enough to where i've got
[43:52.840 --> 43:56.440]  15 employees and you know but like four of those are on
[43:56.440 --> 44:00.040]  web stuff two of them are on shipping one of them is on customer service so i mean
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.880]  you know i have a very small operation but it's growing and
[44:03.880 --> 44:09.720]  it's the it's the true lean mean attack media i mean it is the new media because
[44:09.720 --> 44:14.840]  for what we're doing with 15 people it's it's much bigger do you like what drugs
[44:14.840 --> 44:18.680]  does yeah you know i like that drugs a long time ago
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.040]  he's just such a neocon he kind of sold his soul
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.040]  with the bush administration and so now all those people with shell mountain
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.520]  drugs uh savage all these guys and gals they have really
[44:30.520 --> 44:34.440]  discredit themselves and destroyed their futures i think because they've just
[44:34.440 --> 44:37.960]  been so discredited you know the main line left to destroy their future
[44:37.960 --> 44:42.120]  the main line right to destroy their future only true independent radio shows
[44:42.120 --> 44:45.880]  and tv shows and but i don't think russia will destroy your future well that's
[44:45.880 --> 44:49.720]  because he's got an audience that on average is about eight years old
[44:49.720 --> 44:53.160]  they like hearing that same i don't know a lot of i don't know i don't know i mean
[44:53.160 --> 44:57.800]  he's a pretty strong all right let's go back to college for a couple minutes
[44:57.800 --> 45:00.840]  you know alex is going to be joining us at the top of the second hour and then
[45:00.840 --> 45:04.200]  we're going to have micro vera we're going to be talking about fabled enemies
[45:04.200 --> 45:07.960]  and uh you know alex is doing a great job at the dnc tom martino
[45:07.960 --> 45:11.640]  is really receptive to this information thank you tom all right let's keep going
[45:11.640 --> 45:15.720]  to call let's go to helen in florida helen what's on your mind
[45:15.720 --> 45:19.160]  yes you make gifts that take their money away
[45:19.160 --> 45:23.000]  and this can be done uh by when you have a fine
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.320]  from the state whatever you send them promissory notes are the same as our
[45:27.320 --> 45:31.560]  paper bills i understood this in 1995 you see the five state
[45:31.560 --> 45:35.400]  attorneys for police and a judge four times he brought them back to the jail
[45:35.400 --> 45:37.640]  they found the judge said this is charged
[45:37.640 --> 45:41.960]  also when they're making you pay fines traffic fines to the court
[45:41.960 --> 45:45.320]  they're making you violate the constitution because the constitution says
[45:45.320 --> 45:48.840]  the station has no payment other than gold or silver that's enough people could
[45:48.840 --> 45:52.680]  get together understand be aware of this you make a big
[45:52.680 --> 45:56.840]  indent and what do you think the uh best website for this type of information
[45:56.840 --> 46:01.480]  is i don't know i'm not i don't have a computer
[46:01.480 --> 46:04.440]  oh i got you all right well thank you for the call helen i i hope people uh
[46:04.440 --> 46:07.800]  check out that information uh i've heard a couple cases where people have tried
[46:07.800 --> 46:11.480]  to just pay with uh gold and silver and they don't want to accept it and then
[46:11.480 --> 46:15.320]  they do beat it but it's it's a long and strenuous process i think you got to
[46:15.320 --> 46:18.200]  pick and choose your battles uh maybe this is the battle that you want to
[46:18.200 --> 46:21.400]  pick and choose though i mean i do speak every once in a while over a freedom
[46:21.400 --> 46:25.160]  law school uh those are anti irs and tax protesters federal
[46:25.160 --> 46:27.800]  income tax and uh you know they got a lot of great
[46:27.800 --> 46:31.480]  information they're very good people and i encourage people to check

[46:56.680 --> 46:59.720]  look at the physical anomalies is really going to take a look at this
[46:59.720 --> 47:03.800]  international intelligence organization i already ordered it
[47:03.800 --> 47:06.840]  awesome that i mean i hope i have you seen some of the teasers you see the
[47:06.840 --> 47:11.480]  joe biden teaser oh yes yes i i mean how how ironic is it that i put that in the
[47:11.480 --> 47:14.840]  movie you know i'm back in april and now he's going to be the vp
[47:14.840 --> 47:18.760]  oh yes it's great it's perfect i'm sure it's going to even i hope more people

[47:21.880 --> 47:24.600]  thanks man what else on your mind i just have one question um
[47:24.600 --> 47:27.640]  well not one question one comment uh last week or a couple of weeks ago alex
[47:27.640 --> 47:30.360]  was saying different ways to get the message out
[47:30.360 --> 47:34.840]  um me personally i'm a kidney patient so i have to go dialysis
[47:34.840 --> 47:39.800]  and in my dialysis unit we i play your movies and alex's movies every
[47:39.800 --> 47:43.080]  wednesday night and the other dialysis patients
[47:43.080 --> 47:46.200]  could watch it on their tv because we all got this uh subscreen i just want to
[47:46.200 --> 47:48.760]  tell you um you know it's getting the message out
[47:48.760 --> 47:51.960]  no that's an ingenuitive way to do it man you're you're probably reaching hundreds
[47:51.960 --> 47:55.560]  hundreds of people inside the hospital if not thousands i mean people are
[47:55.560 --> 47:57.960]  laid up on their bed you know they're flipping through the channels that's
[47:57.960 --> 48:01.320]  the way to do it just like public access that's why we make them available to
[48:01.320 --> 48:04.760]  you because we want people to see the information sometimes you can't just
[48:04.760 --> 48:07.960]  have a house party and show the dvd sometimes you just can't go over and
[48:07.960 --> 48:11.000]  throw it in at a friend's house but when people are bedridden that's uh
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.840]  that's a pretty smart way to do it yeah and they they have all thanked me because
[48:14.840 --> 48:18.680]  they were you know sleeping just like i was and you know it woke them up
[48:18.680 --> 48:21.240]  and if you could just reach one other person you know
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.080]  the message is out and i'm glad you know your movies they they sent out a good
[48:25.080 --> 48:27.640]  message and it's it's great i'm i'm thank you again
[48:27.640 --> 48:31.080]  well thank you man be the change you want to see in the world you know that's
[48:31.080 --> 48:33.720]  why i love luke radowski that's why i love we are changed out of work
[48:33.720 --> 48:37.720]  that's why i love jada finnellinoff really broke up recreated 68 into like
[48:37.720 --> 48:41.080]  this pitiful uh you know sub anarchist group that
[48:41.080 --> 48:44.520]  doesn't have the power to shut down free speech at the dnc all right
[48:44.520 --> 48:47.800]  let's jump to yet another caller let's go to fred in philly what's on your mind
[48:47.800 --> 48:51.960]  fred hey i want to touch a few important areas of
[48:51.960 --> 48:56.920]  your mind sure um uh first of all
[48:56.920 --> 49:01.400]  uh did you know that michael turd off was the uh soul
[49:01.400 --> 49:05.240]  person responsible for both the uh anthrax
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.480]  and america investigation and the 911 events
[49:09.480 --> 49:13.960]  well i actually yeah i did he was uh under john aashcroft in the uh
[49:13.960 --> 49:17.960]  in the criminal division of the attorney general's office he absolutely it's
[49:17.960 --> 49:21.240]  actually in my new movie fabled enemies that we don't talk about the anthrax
[49:21.240 --> 49:25.320]  right but we do talk about him shutting down the fbi investigations into the
[49:25.320 --> 49:28.040]  funding of the whole thing and when robert right
[49:28.040 --> 49:31.640]  tried to tell his story because he was uh tracking all of this
[49:31.640 --> 49:35.720]  islamic terrorist money uh he was basically told larry claiming a judicial
[49:35.720 --> 49:39.080]  watch that they weren't interested in his conspiracy theories and we all know
[49:39.080 --> 49:42.760]  that mr share toff was later promoted to the head of homeland security
[49:42.760 --> 49:47.160]  right and i just want to basically remind people that
[49:47.160 --> 49:52.600]  uh he kept dragging his feet he wouldn't at press conferences he would not
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.240]  uh talk about uh the progress of either investigation there has been no
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.360]  official uh doj investigation of either one
[50:02.360 --> 50:06.520]  uh because bush pulled him out of the bureaucracy
[50:06.520 --> 50:12.280]  and it was basically a um uh you know the president's
[50:12.280 --> 50:18.600]  investigation based on uh the fact that he could
[50:18.600 --> 50:21.880]  run it the way he wanted not necessarily i mean come on man look at the
[50:21.880 --> 50:24.440]  investigations that they did in the public even the congressional
[50:24.440 --> 50:27.800]  investigation which is highly compromised right off the bat because you
[50:27.800 --> 50:31.880]  have porter goss and bob graham heading it off two of the people who are having
[50:31.880 --> 50:36.440]  breakfast with mamud Ahmed they have 27 pages redacted in it related to the

[55:54.680 --> 55:58.600]  continue no well the thing is is that i was in
[55:58.600 --> 56:02.200]  i'm at i was in first ranger battalion so that was second ranger battalion
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.840]  but um i went through school and everything with with cat and um so
[56:06.840 --> 56:10.440]  i have a little bit more information on stuff and
[56:10.440 --> 56:14.120]  i'm not sure where all the the information is coming out about
[56:14.120 --> 56:18.120]  you know that he was first i heard he was like you know 50 feet then i heard he
[56:18.120 --> 56:22.520]  was you know 50 yards yeah it was fact is right right
[56:22.520 --> 56:26.680]  yeah well the thing the thing is is that you know they try to say that they took
[56:26.680 --> 56:30.760]  you know they took his uh his his diary and stuff and everything that he was
[56:30.760 --> 56:34.600]  writing and and all that stuff but i mean to be honest with you whether or not it
[56:34.600 --> 56:38.840]  was pat or whether it was me or anything it's we are briefed
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.840]  when we go over you actually aren't allowed to
[56:42.840 --> 56:47.000]  write about anything that you see over there there's certain things that are
[56:47.000 --> 56:50.280]  are you know considered um sensitive
[56:50.280 --> 56:53.400]  sure it's just like your mail is vetted and you get the uh
[56:53.400 --> 56:56.920]  the news that they want you to give you the you listen to the army radio station
[56:56.920 --> 57:00.600]  you're not i mean you're not hooked into even cnn or msnbc or any of that
[57:00.600 --> 57:03.160]  disinformation you're just given what the military tells you and you're not
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.480]  even supposed to write back letters that tell your position correct
[57:07.480 --> 57:11.320]  well yeah i mean we can watch that we can we when we were there we can watch
[57:11.320 --> 57:14.760]  you know news you can have everything like that but i'm talking about
[57:14.760 --> 57:19.160]  you can't write about missions past present or future until you're told
[57:19.160 --> 57:23.400]  that you can write about that stuff so it's considered basically top secret
[57:23.400 --> 57:26.280]  until you can write about it so whether let's what i'm saying whether or not it
[57:26.280 --> 57:29.320]  was pat whether it was me whether it was another guy
[57:29.320 --> 57:33.160]  um they're gonna take that information if they find out that you have that
[57:33.160 --> 57:37.400]  information so what happened was is after death they go through stuff
[57:37.400 --> 57:40.840]  and if they find you know census stuff talking about mission then they're
[57:40.840 --> 57:44.600]  going to take that stuff and and that's something that everybody knows before i
[57:44.600 --> 57:49.240]  mean if i got caught writing about a mission whether it's past present or
[57:49.240 --> 57:53.720]  future and we weren't you know debriefed and told like you can that you can now
[57:53.720 --> 57:58.120]  write about this then it's always basically i'm gonna remain in the in
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.920]  that you know sector basically as top secret but you know i'll ever release
[58:02.920 --> 58:06.680]  that you think will ever release his uh his diaries
[58:06.680 --> 58:09.800]  i think his diaries i mean this is just my personal opinion they probably

[1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:46.600]  and uh i want to let people know that uh cindy shehan caught a phone bugger in
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:50.840]  the act at the dnc unbelievable this is an excerpt
[1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:54.360]  uh from the report posted by cindy shehan at the sinfront
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:57.560]  at the san francisco bay area independent media center
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:00.920]  the most troubling thing that happened though when i arrived back at my hotel
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:03.400]  we got back early because of the altitude and sleeplessness
[1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:06.840]  we're starting to take a toll on us we did not march after the rally so we
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:10.840]  decided to rest before the next event at 7 p.m as i walk toward my room i
[1:01:10.840 --> 1:01:13.480]  noticed that the door was open with the security bolt
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.000]  blocking the complete closing of the door i knew immediately
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.360]  that i had not left the door open and i double checked to make sure
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:23.720]  it was the right room because as a frequent traveler i have never been
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:26.920]  known to forget my room number but it was the right room
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:30.440]  i was upset at first thinking the housekeeping had uh made a mistake
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:33.560]  and left my room open and i was worried that something might be missing
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:39.080]  so i walked into my room and bigger than life there was a man standing by my desk
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:42.600]  holding the room phone and a screwdriver in his hand
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.560]  i immediately said what the hell are you doing
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:49.320]  are you putting a bug in my phone he looked like he got caught with his
[1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:52.840]  hand in the cookie jar and stammered and said no
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:02:00.360]  we're having problems with the phone unbelievable just completely
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:07.320]  unbelievable oh my goodness by the way if you don't

[1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:48.120]  first week well we've all over town but the first time we engage the anarchism
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:52.520]  uh... recreate sixty-eight was around noon or so everybody heard here on the show
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:56.360]  we're peacefully interviewing anarchists streaming live over the web
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:00.600]  they're yelling at us bullhorning me in my face saying we're recreate sixty-eight
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:03.960]  fifty yards away they're having their speaker war Churchill and others
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:06.520]  but they're speaking they start bullhorning they say we're causing a
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:10.920]  disturbance there's media everywhere police on horses riot police
[1:11:10.920 --> 1:11:15.400]  they start shoving me pushing me saying that i'm causing the disturbance and so
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:18.440]  i i just say you know what you want to violate my first amendment you want to
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:21.400]  do what the cops aren't doing the cops weren't valid my first amendment
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:25.320]  i said fine i'm just gonna leave and as i let left they shoved me some more so i
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:27.960]  shoved one guy back he didn't seem to like that
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.000]  and as soon as i shoved him they went oh look he shoved him so these are
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:36.920]  provocateurs of the worst time then last night or in the evening
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:39.400]  about six o'clock here seven o'clock central
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:43.240]  we go down by the Denver man where they were going to go surrounded
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:46.200]  they had the federal police with their machine guns behind it they had the
[1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:50.520]  Denver police around it it's about 300 recreate sixty-eight people
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:54.360]  maximum i mean i said 200 or recreate 68 an anarchist
[1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:57.000]  pretty much i'd call it an anarchist group almost all of them are anarchists
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:00.120]  now a lot of them were fans of the show a lot of them hate the new world order
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:05.880]  but the leaders are all the really rabid ones and it was just blew me away
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:08.760]  that i would have an anarchist while i was just walking down the street
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:12.440]  would come over and start hitting me on the arm
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:15.480]  they would come over and not hard but just uh-huh
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:17.800]  you know they walk up it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood beautiful day
[1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:20.360]  in the neighborhood they sure hit me with a flyer then they hit me with their
[1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:23.720]  knuckles and then this went on and on or i'd be in a crowd just peacefully
[1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:26.840]  videotaping i'm even talking when they come up and oh sorry
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:30.360]  you know run into me and start laughing going alex jones alex jones
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:33.640]  i mean they hate the fact that i've exposed they're just clowns who get
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:37.000]  all the media attention because they act like these geeky clowns
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.160]  and then it discredits everybody jason absolutely
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:44.760]  so then all that happens and and then i've been there about 15 minutes in the
[1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:48.920]  main crowd down from this park right in front of the uh
[1:12:48.920 --> 1:12:53.000]  temperament and lucrehouse we are changed over
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.160]  he goes you know that's Michelle malkin out over there
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:12:59.000]  so i go over to her at first i'm polite but i go you call for internment camps
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.360]  you call for torture and quote one of her bodyguards one of the other bloggers
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:06.360]  she works with it's linked on her site comes over he was he literally says i'm
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:11.320]  big and starts going oh oh you know bumping into me with his stomach because
[1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:15.080]  his chest you know was sunken in with a big belly bouncing it up against me
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:18.280]  i shouldn't talk about it too but this is about five times mine
[1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:20.840]  so it's about six foot five guys bump it into me
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:25.080]  think it's gonna intimidate me that went on and on
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:28.760]  and then they were like these four court gestures they were even dressed up in
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:33.000]  like clown hats who were like little neocon frat boys and they started
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.280]  going kill Michelle malkin kill Michelle malkin
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:40.520]  and they started screaming Alex Jones said kill Michelle malkin
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:44.600]  and they were wearing like ridiculous berets and like putting their arm around
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:47.400]  you and they were basically just trying to distract the issue
[1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:50.680]  but listen here's the issue they were with
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:54.120]  so the ally neocon blotters were about i'd say 12 of them
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:57.400]  or maybe more total of malconer people and saw their cameras and they were
[1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:02.280]  doing some feeds as well but the point here is they expertly
[1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:07.000]  started screaming he killed Michelle malkin and they'd say look
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.360]  he said kill Michelle malkin and the Denver Post
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:13.400]  bit on it said i said kill Michelle malkin doesn't matter that all the
[1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:17.000]  videos archive at info wars dot com for free you can see it from multiple
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.280]  camera angles other people's angles i said nothing like that
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:23.640]  uh... it doesn't matter uh... you know all that happened and then i was very
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:26.600]  clear i said you said that info wars dot com and myself
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:30.360]  were liars on your hot air website you said that the marines not throw that
[1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:32.920]  puppy off the cliff and she just looked totally guilty
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:35.480]  well the Denver Post a bunch of other newspapers
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:40.200]  got it wrong and said that well Alex Jones claims the marines drowned puppies
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:45.720]  so see rather than facing the fact that i exposed that she was wrong and lied
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:49.720]  and said that we were liars about about them killing that puppy
[1:14:49.720 --> 1:14:52.440]  and i don't care about that i reckon children so we covered the puppy issue
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:55.960]  everybody got outraged now it's admitted the marines admitted it was a real puppy
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:59.000]  she said it was a robot puppy that we stated it was fake
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.440]  and instead the Denver Post and and and others it was
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:06.440]  some other papers instead of them coming out and saying Alex Jones confronted
[1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:08.760]  her about how she denied the marines killed that puppy
[1:15:08.760 --> 1:15:12.280]  it was Alex made up that they drowned a puppy
[1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:15.720]  so see i'm on all these videos in front of the news saying through the puppy off
[1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:17.560]  the cliff through the puppy off the cliff
[1:15:17.560 --> 1:15:22.520]  so they built a straw man of me saying that
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:26.040]  that they drowned the puppy that way i can now be a liar
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:29.720]  because marines didn't drown the puppy so so see this is the type of this
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:32.920]  information so now radio stations all over the country
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:38.600]  print media it's alex jones assaulted the poor innocent michelle malcon
[1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:42.920]  alex jones uh made up stuff about drowning puppies
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:46.920]  alex jones said kill her doesn't matter how many videos there are
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:50.520]  doesn't matter how much proof there is because these people are about lies they
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:54.040]  are about deception that's who they are but i want to make clear
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:58.440]  her people were shoving me they grabbed rob Jacobson's uh with his ten thousand
[1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:02.360]  dollar rig camera the they grabbed it they got very very violent with it
[1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:06.680]  they were shoving on erin and the next time he shoved me
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:10.760]  i did shove him and then he played like it was really a hard shovel went oh
[1:16:10.760 --> 1:16:15.160]  and like fell back and they said he pushed me so i mean these people are
[1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:20.840]  despicable they're obviously trained in this but imagine their own people
[1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:25.480]  screaming kill michelle malcon and then screaming next he said kill her
[1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:28.360]  and that's all on clear videos now talk to paul watson about an hour and a half
[1:16:28.360 --> 1:16:31.800]  ago paul went on to talk about martino on top show here in denver
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:36.600]  um and uh paul has now identified and yes it's clear they're the one screaming it
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:40.600]  and they tried to frame me with it now this isn't like uh...
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:44.680]  uh... german talus where where where they could assault him and claim he
[1:16:44.680 --> 1:16:48.360]  attacked somebody in a wheelchair thank god we had video cameras or that's
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:51.000]  exactly what they'd be saying they'd say that i had
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.200]  you know beaten some girl in a wheelchair or something or beat up an old lady
[1:16:54.200 --> 1:16:57.800]  well i mean they already have the recreate 68 guy saying that uh
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:17:01.960]  you know falcon is a true patriot and you're the truth about the toilet they
[1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:05.320]  say they say i'm a provocateur they say i started it
[1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:08.600]  they screamed out she's a patriot they were helping her
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:12.280]  this is what i'm talking about you have the left and the right working together
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:15.960]  in deception and deceit and recreate 68 will ever tell you what they're about
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:19.480]  never stop the war never stop the theme of camps it's all just
[1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:22.840]  look there's other good demonstrations of the fall on gong there's other
[1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:25.800]  groups are much bigger than them clean cut happy families
[1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:29.240]  whatever this group is meant to get all the attention
[1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:31.800]  i don't know if it's by design but they're meant to act like clowns
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:37.000]  they're meant to act like fools act like complete and total morons
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.800]  so that all of the demonstrations are discredited so i so
[1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:47.000]  so so that the media can give them 90 plus percent of the coverage internationally
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:50.920]  these clowns get it and man when we show up on public streets
[1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:54.360]  they get pissed because they do not want us to get any of the media attention
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:57.080]  frankly i don't even like going down around these things but they got
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:17:59.880]  demonstrations going on right now and not even going to we can go in there
[1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:03.640]  right now and basically you know have them a they would come attack us
[1:18:03.640 --> 1:18:06.760]  that would become the media spectacle and they'll say that it's us attacking
[1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:10.600]  them but i'll be clear they talk about are nonviolent they've attacked rob
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:14.440]  they've attacked erin they've attacked myself they i mean they come up they
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:17.880]  they punch you they push you their favorite thing is to elbow you
[1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:22.200]  in the ribs and then if you push them back or even say stop it they start
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:26.760]  screaming no don't be violent no no no don't be bad
[1:18:26.760 --> 1:18:30.360]  don't do that he's hitting me i mean these people are sick
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:33.320]  and that and they're dead i mean i'm gonna welcome people
[1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:38.360]  and the recreate liberals they all behave the same just different rhetoric
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:41.720]  you know that you know they're saying a little bit different issues but
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:46.040]  but the but the that the disinformation the span the games it's all about
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.320]  deception and i guess that's why we're getting all the attention here
[1:18:49.320 --> 1:18:53.240]  and really taking all these groups up is because as george arwell said
[1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:59.080]  in a time of universal deceit or to tell what's exactly rob
[1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:02.840]  in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act alex
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:05.880]  that's what i mean i actually sell an info wars dot com t-shirt that has it on
[1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:08.920]  i'm just so far i wear that shirt we get so tired you then you can

[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:18.440]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act and and that's all we're doing out here
[1:19:18.440 --> 1:19:21.720]  and work other events we've seen the cops be bad we've seen provocateurs
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:25.640]  we've seen this happen the Denver police as far as i can tell are not in on the
[1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:29.080]  provocaturing you know other police departments have we know the feds have
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:33.240]  but they don't need to know they just bring in this foundation group recreate

[1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:39.880]  protesters and then lie and demonize everybody

[1:24:08.680 --> 1:24:12.280]  mean there's just too much thunder and lightning going on with alex
[1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:16.200]  jones live at the dnc right now and we've got michael revere also patiently
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:19.320]  holding on the line i'll let's get michael's take on the dnc and see if
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:21.800]  he has any questions for alex michael are you with us
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:25.640]  yeah i'm definitely there and i've been following uh... on the videos and the
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:29.320]  online streams with what alex is going through uh... with michelle malican and
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:32.520]  with this recreate sixty eight group i think these are the same people they
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:36.040]  used to call themselves renter ruckus and they are put prepaid professional
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:40.040]  disruptors and they're basically following the same model that the fb i
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:42.280]  used to do back in the co entail pro days
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:46.680]  back in the sixties when the goal was to make uh... pro peace and i vietnam war
[1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:49.640]  demonstrators look as bad as possible for the media
[1:24:49.640 --> 1:24:52.200]  and uh... that you know the tactics have not changed
[1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:56.440]  this is exactly what they used to do that you know the this group in fact
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:59.320]  you know we need to find out who pays for them and who runs them
[1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:02.760]  but in all probability they've at least been trained by some of the old co entail
[1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:04.840]  pro people from back in the nineteen sixties
[1:25:04.840 --> 1:25:08.440]  because they're acting exactly like the fb i informants used to do
[1:25:08.440 --> 1:25:10.120]  absolutely alex
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:14.040]  let's go to saturday i'm gonna let you go come up about an hour and a half
[1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:18.360]  is a nine eleven truth march so i'll call in live with that will also have the
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:22.120]  live feed up on info wars dot com i want to thank my brother coming on
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:25.080]  mike i need your help and everybody else's help
[1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:28.760]  getting the videos out that show that i didn't say kill michelle malican
[1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:32.440]  and that her people said that and it said look he said killer
[1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:36.200]  i mean this is really a sick hoax they've now put out it's being picked up by a
[1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:37.800]  lot of radio shows and things
[1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:40.920]  and they just get away with this over and over again we always haven't got over
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:43.320]  that much of what they're totally discredited with most people now
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:46.440]  but it's just so dashardly and so sick so i like to get
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:50.200]  uh... mike revero what really happened dot com's analysis
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:55.560]  uh... of of of that end because both michelle malican her cadre
[1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:57.640]  uh... and the anarchist
[1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:02.920]  we're using the same tactics of just totally lying and making stuff up
[1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:06.600]  mike well like i said but i like i said that that's definitely a tactic that
[1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:09.720]  comes out of co until pro and i've already put up your videos at what
[1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:12.040]  really happened dot com to get the story out
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:15.000]  uh... to basically just show that people decide for themselves
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.120]  you know how the uh... the confrontation with michelle malican went
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:21.800]  it's very obvious she was just trying to ignore you and uh... blow you off in the
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:25.720]  whole situation but yes these are render ruckus people uh... you know they're
[1:26:25.720 --> 1:26:27.960]  they're following they were for her
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:31.080]  they were for her i said but i said michelle malican
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:35.960]  is a great america and started attacking me
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:39.720]  yeah but again it's the same tactics from co until pro and i would not be
[1:26:39.720 --> 1:26:43.720]  surprised if this group does have direct links to the u.s. government
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:47.320]  oh i think it's absolutely obvious i mean they sat there and parroted saying
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:51.160]  we're not a violent group well again they are hosting a quote unquote
[1:26:51.160 --> 1:26:55.640]  shield book dot pdf on recreate dot sixty eight dot com slash p shield book
[1:26:55.640 --> 1:26:59.320]  where they're literally calling for people to mask their face wear helmet
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:03.000]  shield and throw red regardless regardless of that i'm roughing up
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.960]  everybody else up and uh... so it's all on record
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:08.440]  i'm gonna let you guys get back to work i'll call it later with other report
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:11.240]  all right thanks for joining us alex and remember you can see the live video
[1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:16.280]  stream right now over at info wars dot com kind of revolutionary radio a mic
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:20.120]  uh... absolutely and we're seeing a whole revolution right now where
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:23.720]  the old corporate media and government control of information is definitely on
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:26.920]  the wane and the internet and alternative uh... media
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:30.280]  while we're transforming the world just as dramatically as guttenberg did with
[1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:34.280]  movable type and the ruling structures are reacting exactly the same way now
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:37.000]  that they did way back then but in the long run
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.040]  the truth is going to get out the people are going to realize that there are
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:42.440]  other sources of information that are more accurate
[1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:45.480]  and they're they're just going to turn their backs on the you know on the
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:48.280]  government and the corporate media because they're going to recognize it's
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:51.320]  just been a lot of lies and deception and control
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:54.760]  i'm with you a hundred percent and i kind of want to get your take on them
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:58.920]  announcing joseph biden as the democratic nominee for vice president i mean
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:03.080]  this guy is a cfr guy he's got ties to the bush administration
[1:28:03.080 --> 1:28:07.240]  uh... he knows full well about the new world order speaking about it writing
[1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:10.360]  articles about it in the wall street journal why do you think they chose
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:13.400]  this guy and was it a smart move on their behalf
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:17.080]  i think it was a smart move in the context that
[1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:20.520]  if they had not if if obama had not named
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:24.200]  an ardent pro zionist as his vice president
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:28.040]  then hillary would still have funding in support to challenge his nomination
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:29.560]  here at the convention
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.840]  but since the uh... the zionist in israel are going to get what they want
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:36.520]  anyway regardless of whether it's hillary or biden
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:40.360]  then i think hillary support has kind of evaporated and i know we started this
[1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:44.200]  convention with indications hillary might still try and grab something during
[1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:46.920]  the floor vote wednesday but this morning we're beginning
[1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:50.680]  to see indications that her support isn't there that a lot of her delegates
[1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:54.920]  have abandoned her and gone over to obama and uh... that she just is not
[1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:57.640]  really going to be able to mount a significant challenge
[1:28:57.640 --> 1:29:01.400]  of course she's still a woman very much driven by her anger and everybody's
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:05.720]  working to try and calm her down but i think that was a big reason that obama
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:08.920]  went with uh... with biden i think obama
[1:29:08.920 --> 1:29:12.600]  knew as did most of us that if he actually named hillary as his vice
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:15.720]  president he was not likely to survive his first term in office
[1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:18.440]  so he went with the safer choice which was biden
[1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:22.040]  and biden has really been vying for the presidency now in the last two elections
[1:29:22.040 --> 1:29:24.760]  in the uh... democratic primaries
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:27.880]  he's a guy that's well aware of what's going on in the world and he ain't a
[1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:32.120]  good guy i mean he knows about the rfid technology he asked roberts about it
[1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:35.080]  uh... when he became uh... a member of the supreme court
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:38.360]  so you know i'm very suspect of joseph biden i don't think he's a good guy i
[1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:41.480]  think he's the slick talker and many americans are gonna fall for this obama
[1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:42.840]  biden ticket
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:46.040]  go check out the live stream over info wars dot com right now we'll be back

[1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:40.600]  dot com on the line michael was gracious enough to give me an interview for my
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:44.280]  upcoming film fabled enemies that hits prison planet dot tv on august 30
[1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:49.400]  verse and ships out september 1st from the uh... bunker here in austin texas so i
[1:33:49.400 --> 1:33:52.280]  want to play uh... trailer two right now for that
[1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:57.240]  and uh... talk to michael about his participation in the film
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:00.600]  news has learned that some american terrorism investigators
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:03.800]  fear certain suspects in the september 11 attacks
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:08.040]  may have managed to stay ahead of them some u.s investigators believe that
[1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:13.080]  there are israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s.
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:15.960]  whether it's because they're in intelligence services or what they were
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:20.040]  doing i will defer to the department of justice and the fb i
[1:34:20.040 --> 1:34:23.560]  that there was a report on the george washington bridge that there had been a
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:28.600]  van uh... restocked there that had explosives
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:37.560]  amdox limited and israeli based private telecommunications company
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:41.160]  it is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones
[1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:45.640]  without generating an amdox record of it it quickly unraveled to be the largest
[1:34:45.640 --> 1:34:50.520]  forms firing ever uncovered inside the united states the largest
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:54.520]  documents say they quote targeted and penetrated military bases
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:58.600]  the dba fb i and dozens of other government facilities
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:02.360]  is uh... one big elephant in the living room
[1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:05.800]  is the relationship between the united states of america and the state of
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:10.520]  israel what about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:13.960]  happen on nine eleven well it's very explosive information obviously a
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:17.720]  bigger question they say is how could they not have known
[1:35:17.720 --> 1:35:21.640]  all right there it is again on uh... august thirty first you can see that high
[1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:24.600]  quality at prism planet dot tv will probably drop it somewhere late
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:26.120]  afternoon
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.240]  mike why don't you tell people about your i mean you interviewed yourself for it
[1:35:29.240 --> 1:35:32.840]  i wrote the questions down but your participation in it and the uh...
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:35.640]  the topics that we discuss
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.080]  well uh... basically one of the problems with living out here in hawaii and i
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:42.200]  know it's going to come across as very kind of weird uh... for people that i
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.360]  would have a complaint about living out here in hawaii
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:47.320]  but we are very far from the mainland it makes it very difficult to get over
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:49.160]  there to attend public events
[1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:53.240]  and uh... to be interviewed so what we generally do is uh...
[1:35:53.240 --> 1:35:57.000]  uh... again as you indicated you wrote out the questions i set up my own
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.960]  camera and uh... is it in my living room
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:03.800]  and basically shot myself responding to the questions
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:08.600]  uh... uh... and and you did a masterful job of editing it all together so i
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:11.160]  believe that all the time i stammer and stutter
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:15.720]  and uh... lose my place in uh... in the script the magic of final cut
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:19.080]  yet exactly absolutely uh... the
[1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:23.080]  ultimate issue though is that this is uh... you know huge huge scandal
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:25.640]  and because of what you were saying before
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:28.760]  the mainstream corporate media has lost
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:31.960]  the battle for the minds of america the high ground
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:35.320]  uh... is now on the internet the alternative media and because of that
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:37.560]  people are understanding first of all
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:40.520]  that there is something that needs to be looked into there
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:43.800]  that uh... we already know we were lied into the war in iraq
[1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:47.240]  and now everybody saying what else we've been lied to about and they're willing
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:51.080]  to accept that they've been lied to about a lot of things
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:55.000]  they're willing to accept that the government spends huge amounts of money
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  to deceive them and in a way i want to kind of get back to what's going on in
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:01.960]  denver right now because uh... this whole recreate
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:05.720]  sixty-eight group uh... is supposed to be you know coming back
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:09.400]  from uh... you know the chicago seven in the sixty democratic convention
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:13.240]  and then maybe more appropriate in name then they want to let on because what
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:16.760]  most people don't know is that reny davis tom hayden
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:19.240]  and the others who became the seven
[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:21.800]  were being funded by federal money
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:24.760]  it was channeled about a hundred ninety two thousand dollars in federal money
[1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:28.440]  eighty five thousand dollars from the carnegie foundation acting as a conduit
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:32.760]  for cia it was all run through a front group called the chicago student
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:36.920]  health organization and basically
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:41.400]  these radical violent groups are creations of
[1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:47.800]  the government that are used to justify first of all marginalizing dissent
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:51.800]  and eventually you know increase police presence in crackdown
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:55.960]  you know on uh... on those darn dirty hippies to quote ronald reagan
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:38:00.120]  and i i remember when i was in college and this is giving my age away here
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:04.440]  but uh... through their campus informants and for you young kids
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:09.000]  listening to this broadcast yet the fb i have informants on every college
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:13.240]  campus in america and using those informants back in the sixties
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:17.080]  they organized a multi-campus peace march against the vietnam war
[1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:21.720]  ostensibly to take place in front of the disneyland theme park in anaheim
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:26.280]  once the march was underway the organizers again the fb i undercover
[1:38:26.280 --> 1:38:30.600]  informants got everybody cranked up and angry and said they're ignoring us let's
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:34.360]  go inside left the current styles went into the disneyland park
[1:38:34.360 --> 1:38:38.520]  caused a lot of property damage the newspapers were there taking pictures of
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:42.600]  at the national guard showed up the next day it was on every newspaper in america
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:45.800]  how those darn peace marchers had trashed disneyland
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:49.240]  totally discredited the anti-war movement and allowed the vietnam war to
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:53.400]  continue for another two years sixty thousand americans dead complete
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:57.160]  military political disaster all on orders from the nixon
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:01.800]  white house and carried out by the fb i and they're still playing the same
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:05.960]  dirty games today i have to agree with you there and i think that the only
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:08.440]  reason that they didn't get masses there
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:13.000]  under this recreate sixty eight guys is because of the work that jonathan ellen
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:14.920]  off over it we are changed colorado did
[1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:19.160]  because of the work that alex jones did exposing them so that it they were kind
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:23.000]  of marginalized instead of thousands there were hundreds but that doesn't stop
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:26.520]  fox news for showing the hundred protesters that got arrested
[1:39:26.520 --> 1:39:30.120]  uh... for showing their gross tactics where they're uh... you know
[1:39:30.120 --> 1:39:33.720]  actually we've got one we can't play it here but griff jenkins and fox news
[1:39:33.720 --> 1:39:36.840]  actually try to interview some of these people and they are physically assaulted
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:39.880]  the cameraman is physically assaulted pushed out of the crowd
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:44.200]  so is the uh... anchorman and this makes us look like animals this looks
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:47.640]  this makes the true voice of dissent and the real issues
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:50.600]  look like they don't matter and the people that are for these issues
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:53.960]  are just crazies and that's what they want to uh... put forth to the american
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:55.400]  people
[1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:59.640]  well i think the bottom line is you know it worked back in the nineteen sixties
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:02.840]  is it going to work today i don't think so as you said they didn't get the crowd
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:06.360]  there they wanted to get and fox news can put this on the air but it doesn't
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:09.160]  mean anybody's watching and we already know that fox news
[1:40:09.160 --> 1:40:12.920]  viewership is in decline the major newspaper readership is in decline
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:17.080]  the audience is coming over to your show my show your website my website
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:20.360]  our numbers are continuing to climb at a time when most big city newspapers are
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.040]  having to let staff go so the bottom line is they they're still playing the
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:27.080]  games by the rules that worked back at the height of the cold war
[1:40:27.080 --> 1:40:30.680]  before there was an internet and they don't get it
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:34.120]  that they're dealing with the population that is far more sophisticated
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:37.400]  far more educated far more suspicious and skeptical
[1:40:37.400 --> 1:40:40.200]  than was the norm back in the nineteen fifties and sixties
[1:40:40.200 --> 1:40:44.840]  and even the stupid attempt to bring back the cold war by demonizing russia
[1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:48.920]  is not getting any traction today absolutely and you know all the papers
[1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:53.320]  are still saying that rush is the aggressor aggressor the bear is back
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:57.800]  and that poor little georgia when we in fact know that you know us and israeli
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:58.840]  special forces
[1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:02.040]  were in georgia for quote-unquote drills they were moving in all this
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:05.640]  equipment and then they are they attack south ossetia
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:09.480]  and the russians come in to basically stop the ethnic cleansing they actually
[1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:12.520]  get a twelve-year-old american girl from san francisco out of there
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:15.480]  she goes on fox news she lets the cat out of the bag
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:20.040]  and then the next day i watch sock as veily on a glenn beck you know the
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:23.560]  standard double speak even talking about double speak and orwellian double
[1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:26.200]  think but then he really shows his true colors
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:30.360]  in the final segment when he relays that he's part of the new world order
[1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:33.800]  by that verbiage he says this is the this is about the fruit future of
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:37.400]  uh... europe this is about the future of the new world order and russia doesn't
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:40.280]  want that so you know sock as veily is under the thumb i mean
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:43.640]  for instance he's been trying to get into nato he sent the third largest amount
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:47.160]  of troops into iraq for our benefit something like three thousand troops
[1:41:47.160 --> 1:41:52.040]  out there so i mean it it's a very thin veil that is being exposed because of
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:56.440]  sites like yours and ours yeah absolutely and you know it's interesting
[1:41:56.440 --> 1:42:00.680]  just today the u.s. government has announced they will rebuild georgia's
[1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:03.240]  military i mean that's basically an admission
[1:42:03.240 --> 1:42:07.960]  that this whole war by georgia against russia was our idea to begin with
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:10.760]  because we're going to go in there and use taxpayer dollars to replace
[1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:14.840]  everything that was lost absolutely let's take a few callers um let's go to
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:18.440]  thorn in colorado thorn something for michael myself
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:23.800]  hey boss can you hear me yep hey everything yet that all you guys are

[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:41.640]  years and we're honored to have a few other
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:45.160]  servers out there promoting a lot of your
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:49.720]  links and and uh... backing up everything that you've got to say
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:53.480]  and we've got over two hundred and thirty five of of uh...
[1:42:53.480 --> 1:42:58.040]  our staff members here that are i mean just totally a hundred percent behind
[1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:02.040]  what what you guys are doing and i'm i'm located
[1:43:02.040 --> 1:43:05.320]  right outside the gun in the mountains right right on the back that i asked in
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:10.120]  colorado and so i got a lot of a lot of friends and
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:14.120]  and uh... everything down there that that got a lot more info on this
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:18.120]  well you know i went down to denver in uh... february and i was quite shocked to
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:21.880]  see what a beautiful city it was and how aware a lot of people were i was on like
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:25.400]  the mainline radio station there with a guy called uncle nasty who everybody
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:28.280]  seemed to know and i you know he was agreeing with he was a
[1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:32.200]  ron paul guy so it's because of hard work like yours and others out there that
[1:43:32.200 --> 1:43:35.400]  just want to be info warriors that were able to progress i thank you for the
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:38.440]  call i mean it is vitally important like
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:43.000]  everybody that can get involved does get involved we all have great power we all
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.720]  have special skills i mean the skills that you have
[1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:49.160]  with what really happened dot com i mean you put together a website now that
[1:43:49.160 --> 1:43:51.960]  has been up for what something like over a decade
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:55.240]  that has consistently had great information
[1:43:55.240 --> 1:43:58.920]  and has only grown you know other people can do this if they have the will
[1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:02.360]  don't you agree i absolutely agree and even if they don't
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:05.720]  want to bother with the website the most important thing people can do
[1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:09.800]  is just talk about what they're thinking and feeling and and then knowing
[1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:13.400]  with everybody around them because when you speak out you're going to give
[1:44:13.400 --> 1:44:17.160]  other people around you the courage to speak out and one of the biggest lives
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:19.160]  the government is trying to put out all the time
[1:44:19.160 --> 1:44:22.680]  is that people who don't agree with the government are a fringe minority
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:25.240]  they don't matter their cooks you don't want to hang out with them
[1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:29.320]  that's the reason for this recreate 98 is to make people who don't agree with the
[1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:31.800]  government look bad but every time you speak out
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:35.080]  you're going to find yourself you're in a room of people who really do think the
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:38.200]  same way you do and they were all staying silent because they thought they
[1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:40.760]  were the only one so when you speak out you let
[1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:44.280]  them know they're not alone and you give them the courage so that they go and
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:47.000]  speak out and this is how consensus gets built
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:51.480]  absolutely we've got alex jones back on the line from the dnc alex
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:58.200]  yeah i just had fox news call me fox tv fox radio and ask why i'm saying
[1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:02.280]  kill michelle malkin they said why did you say murder her and i told the way i
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:05.720]  said be very careful and they said well it's already out
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:09.800]  if you type into google a bunch of new sources alex jones says kill michelle
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:13.240]  malkin i need all the listeners help to contact
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:16.200]  all these blogs all these news sites and let them know
[1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:20.440]  because they're really going to demonize us all with this new hoax
[1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:23.960]  this is what you do when you say torture is good secret arrest is good
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:27.480]  secret camps are good the Marines didn't kill the puppy
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:30.840]  this is what you do when you're a pile of crap
[1:45:30.840 --> 1:45:36.520]  uh... is that you lie and say that somebody is calling for
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:40.520]  uh... your death and it's all in the videos i didn't say that i need paul
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:43.480]  Watson on this now headline you know you know
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:47.720]  michelle malkin and and and and friends watch huge hoax say alex jones said
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:50.520]  killer because they can't respond to the real facts
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:54.040]  microbarrow i mean i need everybody to hit this hard i'm begging you for help
[1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:56.920]  to analyze this because you're well respected because they're really trying
[1:45:56.920 --> 1:46:00.600]  to give us all a black guy with this with a new huge hoax but we can
[1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:02.760]  we can really catch him with their pants down
[1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:05.640]  we what do you recommend uh... microbarrowing
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:08.440]  i mean i need everybody's help here this is this is a huge hoax
[1:46:08.440 --> 1:46:12.040]  they're launching well i think what you're doing is absolutely the right
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:14.760]  thing i've already got the michelle malkin video up on my website i'm
[1:46:14.760 --> 1:46:16.920]  going to go back and add some commentary to it
[1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:19.640]  yeah everybody needs to go out and start posting stories
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:24.200]  saying once again the meaning of the corporate media is caught in a lie
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:28.040]  they're claiming that alex jones said kill michelle malkin
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:31.160]  he didn't say it it is on the videotape and you just
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:34.920]  we just need to rub it in their faces because when they get the idea that the
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:38.600]  joke ain't working then the hoax ain't working that's when they'll stop
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:41.800]  i agree with you and again these individuals left with her
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:45.000]  there was like three neocon blogs it's all the ones that she plugs on her
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  site uh... put pajamas and some other stupid ones
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:52.680]  they had these frat boys with them posing as an artist doing stupid stuff
[1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:55.640]  for the for her cameras for stage photos with her
[1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:58.440]  i don't know if they're included but they all left together
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:01.400]  and uh... they were dead and then they would scream
[1:47:01.400 --> 1:47:06.520]  uh... to kill kill uh... michelle malkin kill her kill her
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:09.320]  and then said and they would scream why are you saying kill her
[1:47:09.320 --> 1:47:13.000]  and put cameras on me and so i would then say what are you talking about you
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.160]  just said that so they're just complete
[1:47:15.160 --> 1:47:19.560]  bastards i mean they are so dishonest they're so used to american people
[1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:22.440]  that are dumbed down to believe anything and i think this is why the
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:26.760]  main street media is imploding and even their little allied blog sites because
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:29.880]  i mean i wouldn't be surprised if these people weren't hirelings because
[1:47:29.880 --> 1:47:32.920]  i mean i mean hell we know homeland security is the main advertiser
[1:47:32.920 --> 1:47:36.200]  literally homeland security i was on the show malcolm's websites last night
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:40.280]  is her main and almost sole advertiser so it's the fricking government funded
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:43.880]  right in front of everybody running around saying i'm calling for a death
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:46.520]  she already had nutcases after it happened last night could be on the
[1:47:46.520 --> 1:47:48.680]  street start threatening me for being mean to that
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:53.320]  sweet little michelle malcolm people have slandered and libeled and and
[1:47:53.320 --> 1:47:57.080]  and and and and and defamed me but not just me folks they're defaming all
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:00.440]  nine eleven truthers they're saying nine eleven truthers call the death of
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:03.400]  michelle malcolm these people are disgusting they're pulling a false
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:06.040]  flag on us right now i people are on movement
[1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:09.480]  pull a false flag on me last week but i can care less about the stuff they're
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:11.160]  doing i want to believe away from all of them
[1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:15.480]  point is i am being attacked from every side with false flags ladies and
[1:48:15.480 --> 1:48:19.080]  gentlemen we're all they're pulling false flags on us
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:24.280]  alex can i make a suggestion yes okay if i were sitting in your place i would
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:27.880]  definitely consider a lawsuit against one of the media outlets that says that
[1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:31.400]  you said murder michelle malcolm or kill michelle malcolm
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:34.600]  and dare them to produce a video clip of you actually doing that
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:37.800]  and if they can now you may not win the lawsuit because they've got more lawyers
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:41.160]  than you do but it's going to make your name a household name they're going to
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:45.400]  have to respond to it publicly it's a huge opportunity to get this thing
[1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:48.680]  in front of people who otherwise would never see it
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:52.200]  i mean they don't care they say that they said that they didn't kill that dog
[1:48:52.200 --> 1:48:55.160]  they still say we're lying about that and then the Marine Corps admits it i mean
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:48:58.040]  they're just they're just unbelievably deceptive
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:01.800]  i know mike i'm just trying to finish films make films do radio shows

[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:43.400]  all right micro vero what what is your assessment of the situation
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:47.640]  well one of the problems that we're dealing with is you and i and alex and
[1:49:47.640 --> 1:49:50.840]  all of the nine eleven truthers and the people who come to our websites we are
[1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:55.240]  moral citizens we have spent our entire lives believing
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:59.480]  that you tell the truth that you give other people a fair shot at the first
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:02.040]  amendment rights that everybody is supposed to be heard
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:05.640]  unfortunately we get this mindset called the true believer
[1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:09.160]  and these are people who truly believe they know what's best for the country
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:11.560]  over anybody else and this gives them a right
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:14.920]  to play by a different set of rules to lie cheat and steal
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:19.480]  sometimes even murder because they serve a higher purpose or a higher law
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:22.120]  or a higher whatever it is they want to come up with
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:25.880]  but they really convince themselves that everything that they do along these
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:29.400]  lines is really okay because it's for a greater good
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:33.320]  that they themselves have defined as the direction the nation should go in
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:36.520]  and this is what happened when we had nixon with his best and brightest and
[1:50:36.520 --> 1:50:39.400]  they were breaking the laws left and right they did the whole
[1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:42.600]  watergate break in the sabotage of the democratic primaries
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:45.960]  because they truly believe they were what's best for the country
[1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:49.080]  and therefore they were justified in breaking the rules to
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:52.600]  to uh put their agenda forward and and and what we're seeing with this
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:56.840]  recreate 98 group is exactly the same thing they're behaving the way they do
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:59.720]  because they think it's justified by whatever

[1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:19.960]  thursday final segment with mike revero of what
[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:22.440]  really happened dot com we've been talking about
[1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:27.480]  recreate 68 the dnc the provocateurs michelle malkin and alex jones we played
[1:54:27.480 --> 1:54:31.080]  some of that on the show in the first hour and of course they're trying to
[1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:34.120]  say that alex jones called for michelle malkin's death when
[1:54:34.120 --> 1:54:37.880]  of course he didn't call for her death he called for people to realize that she
[1:54:37.880 --> 1:54:41.880]  is saying put americans in internment camps trying to deny that our soldiers
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:45.720]  kill puppies folks they kill a lot worse okay they really do feel like they're
[1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:47.960]  above the law especially the blackwater types
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:51.640]  i mean there's video out there of troops listening to elvis
[1:54:51.640 --> 1:54:55.480]  as they gun down the cars behind them with uh...
[1:54:55.480 --> 1:54:58.280]  you know they have no idea who's in those cars those cars are hundreds of yards
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:02.840]  away and they literally open machine gun fire and that's what's really going on
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:06.680]  that is the real deal we have blackwater now openly
[1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:11.080]  uh... opening up a security and intelligence arm it's not just
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:14.280]  you know about them marching down helping troops are
[1:55:14.280 --> 1:55:17.320]  helping quote unquote private investors now they're going to be quote
[1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:20.360]  unquote gathering intelligence i mean this was an intelligence op
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:24.200]  from the beginning in order for them to have their own privatized armies
[1:55:24.200 --> 1:55:27.480]  that will come in and kill us if necessary mike
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:30.760]  well absolutely uh... we're we're seeing a tremendous amount of
[1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:34.200]  of abuse within our own country and it's very obvious
[1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:38.200]  that a government that is willing to simply ignore the rules of international
[1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:41.160]  uh... of warfare international of warfare
[1:55:41.160 --> 1:55:44.040]  that they're they're they're not going to be respecting their own laws here in
[1:55:44.040 --> 1:55:47.000]  the united states and we've seen that with bush declaring the constitution to
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:50.200]  be a blankety blank piece of paper we certainly have seen
[1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:53.640]  the very real world ramifications of his attitude
[1:55:53.640 --> 1:55:56.920]  uh... the first amendment is now confined to free speech zones
[1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:01.240]  uh... uh... they've been the the fourth and fifth amendments are are all but
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:05.320]  gone uh... they're reading our emails without warrants they're listening to
[1:56:05.320 --> 1:56:08.120]  our phone calls without warrants the fb i has just been given
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:11.640]  authority to conduct investigations on anybody
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:15.160]  without justification they don't have to prove suspicion and out of the
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:18.680]  reasonable cause they can just say we're investigating anybody we feel like
[1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:22.920]  anytime we feel like and just go in on fishing expeditions to try and find
[1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:26.920]  something we can use to bludgeon them with or intimidate them with to keep
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:29.800]  them uh... in line and going along with what the government says and folks
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:33.000]  that the dictatorship when the government is hunting through your life to
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:36.840]  find things they can use to control you with that is a dictatorship
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:40.680]  i'm with you a hundred percent and obviously is a dictatorship in the
[1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:43.000]  bill that you're talking about uh... you know
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:46.680]  some false left right guys like ross feingold and uh... ted kennedy
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:49.080]  yeah right he's on our side are speaking out against it
[1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:51.960]  but this one literally says that they can
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:56.360]  they can create a profile on you go and uh... conduct interviews with your
[1:56:56.360 --> 1:57:00.200]  neighbors not representing themselves as law enforcement fb i homeland
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:03.320]  security or at or anything just representing themselves as a normal
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:06.840]  person and seeing if the the neighbors want to throw you under the bus and
[1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:10.280]  then if they do want to throw you under the bus they're going to be an fb i
[1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:14.040]  asset a homeland security asset and it is literally a new stasi force
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:17.240]  they're going to use on american citizens who are not suspected of doing
[1:57:17.240 --> 1:57:18.680]  anything like
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:21.720]  yeah that's that's absolutely and you name them correctly it's a whole new
[1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:24.440]  stasi or if you prefer it's the gestapo
[1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:27.640]  and that's exactly what it is and all i can imagine is
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:31.560]  that our president's grandfather must have filled george's head
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:35.480]  full of all kinds of good stories about it was his german business partner
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:39.400]  and what great ideas he had and that you know that at all fellow almost pulled
[1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:41.720]  it off and you really ought to give it a try and
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:45.720]  uh... if you can make it work because that sure seems to be what he's doing
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:49.720]  well what do you feel about obama going to berlin and talking about quote on
[1:57:49.720 --> 1:57:52.360]  quote global citizenship and in the future
[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:56.040]  the global citizen will have to do more not less mike
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:57:59.720]  well before i was doing this i was working sixty hours a week to barely
[1:57:59.720 --> 1:58:03.960]  push out twenty four geese a year to you know rent a house and maybe be able to
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:08.200]  eat all week i mean more not less this is insanity
[1:58:08.200 --> 1:58:11.480]  i would agree with you and it gets back to that with that quote from george
[1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:14.600]  bush where he talked to that divorcee who's working three jobs
[1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:17.720]  and they say well that's fantastic that's truly american you know and
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:20.360]  and then he makes jokes about are you getting enough sleep
[1:58:20.360 --> 1:58:24.200]  and you know our entire political leadership republican and democrat
[1:58:24.200 --> 1:58:28.280]  they seem to view americans as just a population to be flawed to work harder
[1:58:28.280 --> 1:58:32.680]  and tax more they really do view it as an unending source of what i think mike

[2:01:24.760 --> 2:01:28.360]  would have harsh words on the senate floor
[2:01:28.360 --> 2:01:31.960]  and the word should go out
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:37.080]  to those who pretend
[2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:40.280]  that they wish to be our friends that they're going to have to make some
[2:01:40.280 --> 2:01:44.440]  very difficult choices pakistan in particular
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:47.800]  is going to have to make a very difficult choice
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:51.720]  very soon words will not be sufficient
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:57.960]  actions will be demanded when biden was confronted he confirmed his meeting
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:01.880]  with them that saying pakistani intelligence was indeed funding the
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:07.480]  taliban in the days in the days following not 11 you
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:11.000]  met with the head of pakistani is i don't know how to admit it has since
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:14.040]  come to light that he ordered say each week to wire a hundred thousand miles
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:17.480]  to manhattan mohammedata why was he allowed to go back to pakistan
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:20.280]  and why was he questioned and why were you meeting with him
[2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:24.440]  i met with him to deliver a message that if he didn't
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:28.360]  if he didn't stop supporting the taliban
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:31.400]  we would take him on why do we let him go we let him fly freely we never
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:34.040]  investigated him we never even looked into him

[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:41.960]  came but he fined the hijackers and you let him go and he swore he hijacked
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:45.240]  the hijackers no one knew he fined his stuff he hijacked it's why i didn't say
[2:02:45.240 --> 2:02:49.080]  get the order he would later state that the
[2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:54.120]  information was indeed classified how did you know
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:03:00.840]  isai was helping the taliban sir

[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:41.800]  using the anarchist sure i agree with that but
[2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:45.000]  even if they can't discredit the movement like they did in the sixties
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:48.840]  it's still still provides cover uh... i think for the police to get away with
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:51.480]  just about anything they want
[2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:55.080]  because well for i'm sure you probably already covered this this morning

[2:04:18.600 --> 2:04:22.360]  instances have been pretty restrained daytime if you watch the hundred
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:26.200]  protesters or so they got arrested uh... they were anarchist they were
[2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:29.240]  provocaturing the police the police weren't hitting on them
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:32.600]  you know i'm no fan of being in black uniforms or whatever but they haven't
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:36.040]  broken out the rubber bullets they haven't broken out the microwave guns

[2:08:58.760 --> 2:09:08.120]  um uh very much involved ever since um i got out of the military in 1952
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:14.120]  um while i was in the military i you know i got a quite an education as to
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:17.800]  how our government was functioning at that point
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:22.840]  and i didn't uh i didn't like what i seen and what i heard
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:28.680]  but i was uh laboring under the same handicap that most americans are
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:31.880]  um because i had gone to a government school
[2:09:31.880 --> 2:09:35.240]  graduated from high school a government high school
[2:09:35.240 --> 2:09:40.040]  and um so for many years i tried to make the system work
[2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:44.680]  the way they taught me in those government schools and
[2:09:44.680 --> 2:09:48.280]  uh eventually i came to the point where i understood
[2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:55.000]  that i had been miseducated i had been propagandized i had been
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:58.920]  uh taken advantage of my uh gullibility
[2:09:58.920 --> 2:10:05.720]  and uh the fact that um we put way too much trust in government
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:11.560]  and um so for the last 35 years or better i have been
[2:10:11.560 --> 2:10:17.480]  um very much an activist in trying to inform my fellow americans
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:22.760]  um of the precarious situation that we're in and of course it is becoming
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:27.240]  more precarious almost as the days go by except
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:31.720]  um i was on a show about three weeks ago
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:39.240]  and um the response we received was so gratifying it was so
[2:10:39.240 --> 2:10:45.800]  exciting for me because um it was the greatest response i've ever had from a
[2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:50.760]  talk show and i've done many many i guess hundreds of them
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:57.320]  over the years and um i uh found that there are more
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:05.320]  frustrated angry americans today um then we've ever seen in in a long long time
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:10.280]  uh probably never before have we seen so many frustrated americans and they're
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:13.720]  frustrated because they don't know what to do
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:17.640]  uh to clean up the mess that has been created
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:21.560]  uh for us the political quagmire that we're in
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:27.800]  and so um that gives me uh a little more reason for being optimistic i've
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:32.440]  always been an optimist and uh i've always been solution oriented
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:38.280]  um i didn't become active in the freedom movement until
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:42.680]  i understood the answers and where we had gone astray
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.760]  and how we had been miseducated misled
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:51.720]  um and so where i was able to communicate with my fellow americans
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:56.920]  as to what we need to do to get our country back on track
[2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:01.720]  and um again have the rule of law in this country
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:04.920]  absolutely bring back the constitution and bill all right and i'm so
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:09.000]  uh warmed to hear that you had a great response i mean alex jones has just done
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.720]  an incredible job in waking up the masses to this
[2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:15.800]  false left right paradigm i want to get into how you became an author when did
[2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:20.200]  you decide to you know write this on paper try to reach the masses and then
[2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:23.640]  what was probably the medium of its day books i really feel like the medium
[2:12:23.640 --> 2:12:27.320]  of the day today is really movies and even youtube lectures and things like
[2:12:27.320 --> 2:12:30.760]  that i think you reach a lot more people that way but back then i mean
[2:12:30.760 --> 2:12:34.600]  in the late 70s early 80s books were really the way to
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:39.000]  reach a wider audience so what made you decide to become an author
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:43.640]  well um uh i have a little bit of a little different
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:49.320]  uh um observation to make um back in the 70s
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:56.040]  um we started using uh television um we produced television specials back in
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:02.040]  montana and um and we really shook up uh a lot of
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:08.040]  people a lot of politicians and such um and uh people kept telling me they said
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.160]  you have to write a book you have to put this
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:15.720]  down in a book where people can read this information
[2:13:15.720 --> 2:13:20.440]  and of course i that was the last thing i ever wanted to do was write a book
[2:13:20.440 --> 2:13:25.800]  and um and then um i had an experience where a fellow came
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:30.120]  to one of our seminars we had several hundred people there
[2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:35.000]  and uh and this fellow was a hard money man he was
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:41.960]  uh very um uh very large uh i had a very large uh business
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:48.200]  uh gold and silver and such and um and then he told me he said he said i
[2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:52.680]  ever i go to every international monetary conference there is
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:58.120]  and he said i've never heard uh anyone that could hold an audience
[2:13:58.120 --> 2:14:02.040]  like you and he says i've heard the best speakers in the business
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:05.960]  and um here i had been trying to get someone to go
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:09.160]  straight for me and i hadn't had any luck at that
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:13.720]  and so i i thought about this for several months and then i told my
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:19.960]  Mrs i said you know i said um uh charlie told me that
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:23.880]  uh i can hold an audience better than most people and
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:29.000]  i said if i sit down and if i write like i speak
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:33.080]  then perhaps i can hold the attention of a reader
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:37.160]  and i sat down and i wrote the board book born again republic
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:42.760]  in um in about two weeks and um i didn't know anything about book printing
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:45.640]  or anything so i made some mistakes but i
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:51.320]  uh published that book and that book uh that was in the fall of 1980
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:55.560]  and uh that book is still in print and uh
[2:14:55.560 --> 2:14:59.720]  uh it holds people's attention quite well very well i guess and
[2:14:59.720 --> 2:15:04.840]  and so um we and that that started something and of course i
[2:15:04.840 --> 2:15:10.280]  uh published a couple three more uh shortly thereafter why they are
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:14.040]  one book i let it go out of print and that was due into the iris as they would
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:18.360]  do into you and i may have i may have to go
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:22.120]  back and reprint that one because uh we're getting
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:27.320]  uh still getting calls for it uh and then of course i printed the the book
[2:15:27.320 --> 2:15:31.560]  the church deceived which is still in print and will stay in print
[2:15:31.560 --> 2:15:37.400]  um and and the iris and the black robe cover up and um
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:41.560]  and i wrote the book uh walls in our minds in 89
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:47.320]  90 is when i first published it and then in 97 i published the book
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:53.480]  well why the militia and uh that book um
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:58.680]  it uh it it sold well but it hasn't gotten nearer the
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:04.680]  the coverage that it should and um because it's it has some tremendous
[2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:10.840]  ideas and and thought in there and uh i explain the constitution in our system
[2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:15.000]  of our political system is designed by the founders
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:20.680]  i explained it as no one has ever explained it and um
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:26.280]  so um you know i i started with the television and we had great results
[2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:34.600]  with it we ran uh on the satellite uh we we had the programs on the satellite
[2:16:34.600 --> 2:16:42.200]  uh in 1986 and um and that worked quite well but the it became too
[2:16:42.200 --> 2:16:46.760]  expensive and uh we just haven't produced much in the
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:53.480]  way of television um now for some time um other than a dvd
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:57.640]  that i produced last year with pat shannon a lot of people know pat shannon
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:02.920]  he's an associate editor uh for uh america free press
[2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:07.800]  uh i've known pat for many years and uh and so um
[2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:13.880]  you know the the the television is very effective but it got too expensive for
[2:17:13.880 --> 2:17:19.080]  us uh to uh run the television like we did back
[2:17:19.080 --> 2:17:25.800]  in the late 70s and the early 80s um and we just uh we couldn't make it pay off
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:30.520]  but uh in the late 70s it was so interesting because we didn't have
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:35.320]  cable we didn't have satellite and um in montana
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:40.360]  um we had the the only thing that people could get was
[2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:45.560]  uh their antenna and uh they had to be in range and there'd usually be just two
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:49.880]  channels one or two channels at all and that was ideal we we had
[2:17:49.880 --> 2:17:54.760]  tremendous coverage and uh tremendous results too
[2:17:54.760 --> 2:17:59.240]  absolutely and uh you know truly a pioneer of your day and you continue
[2:17:59.240 --> 2:18:02.680]  to do these types of radio shows do you have a website right now
[2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:10.200]  no i don't um uh i'm i'm pushing 80 and and as i um uh
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:14.120]  left a message on the email for um alex out
[2:18:14.120 --> 2:18:18.920]  uh i have problem health problems that limit my activities my moving
[2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:24.440]  around and and so uh my activities at this point are
[2:18:24.440 --> 2:18:28.920]  um i do a lot of phone conversations with people around the country who are
[2:18:28.920 --> 2:18:33.160]  having uh problems with the internal revenue service
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:37.000]  and uh of course as i said on the last show we've
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:43.240]  uh developed a letter that um with some content that is really
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:47.880]  um it's uh stopping the iris for the most part
[2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:52.520]  dead in their tracks and uh i think we're going to see a lot more
[2:18:52.520 --> 2:18:57.800]  of of this kind of thing where um uh
[2:18:57.800 --> 2:19:01.480]  people are are are doing their research they're doing their
[2:19:01.480 --> 2:19:06.840]  homework and uh a lot of them out there they know the iris code better than
[2:19:06.840 --> 2:19:11.720]  anybody in the internal revenue service or in the in the department of justice
[2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:16.840]  and of course uh the key is that we now know how to
[2:19:16.840 --> 2:19:23.320]  uh control the federal judiciary that's the big thing and and uh when i first
[2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:26.920]  got into this it it became very clear to me
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:30.600]  in the very beginning back in the seventies mid-seventies
[2:19:30.600 --> 2:19:35.560]  that um our problem with the internal revenue service is
[2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:39.000]  that the federal judges the federal courts
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:44.520]  have uh uh created a domestic terrorist organization all right hold it
[2:19:44.520 --> 2:19:47.480]  right there red beckman we'll be back after this it's the alex joneshow

[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:03.720]  um so why don't you go on you were talking about this criminal organization
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:08.760]  that is the IRS yes um the um
[2:25:08.760 --> 2:25:13.560]  the IRS is a domestic terrorist organization today
[2:25:13.560 --> 2:25:18.120]  and they were created by the federal judiciary
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:25.000]  and um the the federal judiciary um the founders of this
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:31.400]  country they were more concerned about the federal judiciary being a problem
[2:25:31.400 --> 2:25:36.760]  they did not see the the the legislative and executive branches being
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:41.720]  that much of a problem but they really understood how dangerous
[2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:45.960]  uh the judiciary would become and thomas jefferson addressed it quite
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:51.960]  strongly and um and and really tried to advise us
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:55.640]  uh to be very careful and very protective
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:59.480]  of our rights because the judges would take the the um
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:06.920]  the um power and and misuse it now i i um just looked in my book here why the
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:11.720]  militia and um here's one of the things that i said
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:15.960]  this has been out 11 years we were taught
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:19.800]  we were taught the u.s supreme court would interpret the constitution and
[2:26:19.800 --> 2:26:25.880]  bill of rights the nine justices of this supreme court are all
[2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:30.920]  and government employees these nine lawyers have a paycheck that is
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:36.440]  evidence of a conflict of interest anyone who would trust nine
[2:26:36.440 --> 2:26:40.120]  paid lawyers to protect their freedoms from government
[2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:45.960]  is suffering from a bad case of propaganda poisoning
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:49.640]  well i absolutely agree with you there i mean that we've put uh
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:53.800]  really the government's power into such a consolidated few people's hands and now
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:56.680]  with you know with 9 11 i mean we just passed such
[2:26:56.680 --> 2:26:59.560]  nightmarish legislation that it was really the beginning of the end not
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:02.520]  even the beginning of the end but really the last death march for the
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:06.120]  constitution and bill of rights and even this week it's gone even further
[2:27:06.120 --> 2:27:09.480]  they've announced that they now will be spying on citizens
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:14.120]  uh with no provocation no cause no suspicion whatsoever and then they're
[2:27:14.120 --> 2:27:18.520]  going to be doing uh cold interviews not representing themselves as
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:24.280]  fb i c i a i r s homeland security with their neighbors
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:27.880]  and then their neighbors want to turn on them then they'll offer them a little
[2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:32.680]  bit of scratch and they can be part of the new stasi force in america
[2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:39.320]  uh... this is uh... uh... where we the people if we can get ourselves
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:43.400]  reeducated uh... first we have to deep program ourselves
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:48.200]  we have to um recognize that we have been duped
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:53.000]  we have been mislead we have been misinformed we've been miseducated
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.920]  and uh... that we've got to uh... have a real
[2:27:56.920 --> 2:28:01.080]  and you know uh... love of truth we've got to
[2:28:01.080 --> 2:28:05.720]  be looking for truth and wherever we have to go to find it
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:10.760]  and uh... the truth is out there it's available and uh...
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:15.640]  so uh... the people have to uh... find the truth and then
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:18.360]  they learn one of the things they learned
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:25.480]  is that we the people with our grand jury and our trial jury votes
[2:28:25.480 --> 2:28:30.520]  we have the authority to interpret the constitution i shouldn't say that i
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:34.920]  shouldn't say it that way we don't interpret the constitution the courts
[2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:38.600]  don't have a right to the interpret the constitution
[2:28:38.600 --> 2:28:43.080]  uh... we're not changing from one language to another
[2:28:43.080 --> 2:28:48.760]  uh... we can explain the constitution we can explain it we can get a grasp on it
[2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:52.520]  but we're not changing the constitution from one
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:56.520]  uh... language into another which the word interpret means
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:29:00.920]  and uh... that's just one of the things uh... that they taught
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:05.160]  that uh... we uh... swallowed at the point and sinker
[2:29:05.160 --> 2:29:10.520]  and uh... we should have known that uh... they were playing words or games
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:14.840]  with our language and uh... so we the people
[2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:19.240]  we are to be the enforcers of the constitution
[2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:24.200]  uh... i explain the constitution and the bill of rights and the declaration
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:28.280]  of independence i explained it uh... motion much different than a lot of
[2:29:28.280 --> 2:29:30.680]  people you know i explained it the right way
[2:29:30.680 --> 2:29:33.560]  you know the uh... for the people by the people where we're going to be back

[2:34:39.560 --> 2:34:46.840]  um i uh i need to make a correction i'm i'm the co-author of the law that never was volume one
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:55.240]  okay um bill benson is the other um co-author involved in that um in uh 1980 the summer of
[2:34:55.240 --> 2:35:04.760]  1980 it was june of 1980 um we we had a conversation i had a conversation with a gentleman in montana
[2:35:05.400 --> 2:35:12.440]  um and and we got uh uh to talking about the problems we've got in this country and one thing
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:22.760]  another and um i uh had a a kind of a list of lies i said uh our politicians uh have lied to us
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:30.520]  about pearl harbour and korean vietnam and social security and energy shortage and um and this fellow
[2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:36.280]  he um said you know he said um i wonder if they lied to us about the 16th amendment
[2:35:37.400 --> 2:35:43.640]  i hadn't thought of that one and so uh we discussed it and i said well i said with the
[2:35:43.640 --> 2:35:51.640]  track record that the politicians have for truth uh and and telling us the the opposite of truth
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:58.200]  um i i said we just about have to know that there's something wrong with the 16th amendment
[2:35:58.760 --> 2:36:06.120]  and uh this gentleman says well we better find out and so uh there were some uh small business
[2:36:06.120 --> 2:36:12.760]  people and ranchers and farmers in montana that uh kind of formed an ad hoc uh type of uh
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:21.080]  um committee i guess and they called themselves the montana historians and they started the
[2:36:21.080 --> 2:36:29.800]  process of uh checking out the state um archives in the different states the 48 states that we
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:39.960]  had in 1909 and um error 1913 is when we had that many we didn't have 48 states in 1913
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:49.880]  when the uh 16th amendment was proposed in congress uh anyway by 1983 in fact um by
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:58.200]  the fall of 1980 we knew when i wrote the book born again republic my first book we knew that the
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:08.760]  16th amendment was a fraud uh because of senate document 240 and uh but by uh january of 1983
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:16.360]  we um uh those uh hardworking people up there in montana did a uh a fantastic amount of work
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:23.240]  um one of the fellows was from wyoming even that got involved and uh they wrote a lot of
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:30.760]  letters and collected all these documents and um it never dawned on us we were we were just novices
[2:37:30.760 --> 2:37:38.520]  and uh amateurs and um we never realized that uh the courts would uh immediately say oh you've
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:44.520]  got to have it certified all your documents have to be certified well that was just part of our
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:52.280]  education uh and of course uh we took the evidence i took the evidence i was subpoenaed into a case
[2:37:52.280 --> 2:38:00.840]  in um fort worth texas in march of 83 and um that was the first i think that the us justice
[2:38:00.840 --> 2:38:12.760]  department knew uh what we had done and um and of course uh then in 1983 um or 84 i guess it was
[2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:21.640]  uh no 83 uh i was subpoenaed in a case in chicago and we tried again and the judge told us that
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:26.920]  our documents weren't certified and therefore they did not have to take them as evidence and they
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:38.600]  sent a young family man to jail uh and it was uh you know it was a blatant um obstruction of justice
[2:38:38.600 --> 2:38:47.560]  it was blatant on the part of the federal judge he was a reagan appointee he uh uh took his orders
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:58.680]  from uh washington dc i'm sure and um and so anyway um bill Benson was working with the defense
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:09.160]  attorney as a paralegal and um um bill Benson uh the defense attorney andy spiegel um he agreed
[2:39:09.160 --> 2:39:18.280]  that we needed to send somebody to the states uh to collect the certified documents uh on this
[2:39:18.280 --> 2:39:23.720]  and of course the judge had more or less uh said that we had to have somebody go to the states
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:29.560]  personally and collect all of this documentation and bill Benson agreed to go and we could not
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:36.280]  have found a better man to do the job because he was uh a criminal investor had been a criminal
[2:39:36.280 --> 2:39:42.760]  investigator for the department of revenue for the state of illinois and when he went out to the
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:50.760]  states um he didn't take no for an answer from anybody and i he just uh stayed on this thing
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:40:02.120]  like a bird dog and he uh by christmas eve of 1984 uh he called me from um uh olympia washington
[2:40:02.760 --> 2:40:10.280]  and said i've got the last state and uh what a an emotional thing that was and of course then
[2:40:10.280 --> 2:40:20.680]  we published uh the law that never was volume one in april of 1985 of 85 yeah 85 and uh so
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:27.720]  that's been out now 23 years and um the the justice department and the federal judiciary
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:35.080]  have obstructed justice and this is a felony uh they have obstructed justice they have not
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:43.800]  allowed this evidence to um be uh brought um by us to the federal grand jury we have not
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:53.640]  been able to use it in the defense of of criminal cases and um uh it's been uh a a real demonstration
[2:40:53.640 --> 2:41:00.920]  of judicial criminal activity and criminal activity on the part of justice department
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:11.720]  attorneys it is uh it's going to go down in history as uh being an example of how evil and how
[2:41:11.720 --> 2:41:20.360]  criminal um government can become if the people don't maintain control of government and the people
[2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:25.240]  have done that no we have not we have actually went to bed we are more apathetic than ever we
[2:41:25.240 --> 2:41:29.400]  are more miseducated and uneducated on the issues than ever before we're sucking down
[2:41:29.400 --> 2:41:33.560]  jenny light and watching american idol concerned about our favorite football teams and we have
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:37.240]  no idea most people don't even know what the three branches of government are they're like
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:42.040]  branches of government they don't even what are you talking about it's like right it's a judicial
[2:41:42.040 --> 2:41:46.760]  executive legislative it's called checks and balances it was there to protect us it's no longer
[2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:50.840]  there and i'm just wondering you know obviously you're very old school have you seen some of the
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:57.080]  new school tools such as uh erin russo's america freedom to fascism oh yes i've seen it and and
[2:41:57.080 --> 2:42:06.760]  of course uh the first uh my first reaction was no solution and um as i said earlier i'm solution
[2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:17.080]  oriented and um i don't i don't put anything out without defining uh the solution um then the hundreds
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:24.280]  of people that uh recent first show i hear three weeks ago well it wasn't my first but i hadn't
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:33.240]  done a show with alex for several years because i was very ill for uh some time and uh and so
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:38.680]  those hundreds of people they got that little book walls on our minds and um i'm sure you'll
[2:42:38.680 --> 2:42:44.680]  have some calling in and and saying hey um there's the solution the solution is there
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:52.840]  um i don't put out books without a solution and and so um this is what we've got to get to we've
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:43:01.000]  got to get the american people to recognize uh you know an alcoholic he really can't be helped
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:08.360]  until he recognizes that he is he's he's got a problem uh and the american people really
[2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:13.640]  can't be helped that much until they recognize that they've got a problem and that they're very
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:21.400]  much a part of the problem and that they have to deprogram their minds of all this uh misinformation
[2:43:21.400 --> 2:43:30.040]  and false information propaganda uh that we have been fed in our education system um our schools
[2:43:30.040 --> 2:43:38.120]  are a total disaster and uh the government controls them politicians control them and you're not
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:43.640]  going to get a good product if uh coming out of those schools as long as we have that that situation
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:48.680]  where government controls them i have to agree with you there let's take some callers uh let's jump
[2:43:48.680 --> 2:43:54.840]  to daniel in south dakota daniel you got a uh comment or question for myself a red are you
[2:43:54.840 --> 2:44:01.880]  there daniel all right if he's gone let's jump to david and denver david are you there hey how's
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:07.720]  it going good man what's on your mind all right we're just looking at the denver post here i uh
[2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:15.480]  now they have a picture of alex and uh and someone talking and alex is doing the talking yet they say
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:21.640]  uh they say radio host alex joan gets an earful from demonstrator straighter nick brown during
[2:44:21.640 --> 2:44:27.560]  must is freedom march protesting the war in iraq yeah this is the guy who took the bullhorn and
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:33.800]  just started bullhorning alex's face while erin was trying to uh get an interview with uh provocateur
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:39.240]  and false left paradigm idol war church hill who you know equates all those people that died in the
[2:44:39.240 --> 2:44:42.840]  world trade center to little eichmann's they're not little eichmann's my friend they were american
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:49.080]  citizens they were hard workers they didn't deserve what they got no well anything else dave
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:56.200]  i just wanted to thank you guys for doing a good job alex has been he woke me up a couple years
[2:44:56.200 --> 2:45:02.280]  after nine i'm glad i got the information and and like uh you folks were saying we we need
[2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:09.000]  the rest of america to wake up absolutely adapt either we have we just sit and we don't even have
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:14.040]  the we don't even stand up for ourselves anymore absolutely not well we don't know the issues
[2:45:14.040 --> 2:45:19.800]  anymore dave uh what do you think mr beckman i i mean obviously most most people have no idea
[2:45:19.800 --> 2:45:24.200]  what's going on you know they they barely even watch the mainstream media which is total propaganda
[2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:29.800]  i mean your your solution orientated how are we going to get around this um we're not going to
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:36.280]  get around it uh as much as i'd like of course uh it'll only take five percent if we can get five
[2:45:36.280 --> 2:45:43.720]  percent educated we'll put at least one person on uh inform person on just about every jury in the
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:51.240]  country and um we had one of the responses from the last show the lady um said that um
[2:45:51.880 --> 2:45:58.600]  she had just had an opportunity to serve on a jury and of course she had gotten uh exposed to some
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:05.800]  of my material before and uh she was so elated because uh she got called for jury duty and
[2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:14.520]  served on the jury and was able to utilize the information effectively and uh and so uh we only
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:21.080]  need about five percent that are really educated uh to make a difference now we want more than five
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:27.240]  percent and and of course uh in the days ahead here we're going to have more of our american
[2:46:27.240 --> 2:46:35.400]  uh people that are going to be um uh pushed up against the wall uh they're going to uh
[2:46:35.400 --> 2:46:42.520]  perhaps even uh find where uh food is uh is hard to get and and uh almost impossible
[2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:49.080]  and uh and that's going to wake a lot of people up absolutely and that's why you know we carry
[2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:52.920]  e-foods direct and we they're a big supporter of the show we're a big supporter of them i mean
[2:46:52.920 --> 2:46:58.200]  i i hope it doesn't come to that where there's rations bread lines you know 29 all over again
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:02.200]  but in this new technocracy it's going to be much worse all right let's jump to another caller let's
[2:47:02.200 --> 2:47:10.520]  go to zack in illinois zack what's on your mind hello what can i do for you sir uh i'm sorry that
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:15.560]  i'm not really speaking on topic with your guest but i was thinking about uh what alex was dealing
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:20.680]  with today with michelle malkin and all that um the first thing i thought about it was that
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:27.640]  that's really lame the entire tactic is very obvious and to me it's a little desperation and uh you
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:33.400]  know a whack of options for them because they're certainly someone tasked with opposing him
[2:47:33.400 --> 2:47:39.400]  and making trouble uh for the efforts going on out there but it's really a very it doesn't seem
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:45.000]  very effective it seems very obvious and very very lame it is really the word that best describes
[2:47:45.000 --> 2:47:50.920]  it to me it's just not very not very effective well it's not very effective but it's going back
[2:47:50.920 --> 2:47:55.560]  to their old school book of disinformation and just trying to equate him with the anarchist
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:48:00.120]  with the people calling for other people's deaths we're a peaceful organization we believe in the
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:04.920]  principles of gondy and martin luther king jr through peaceful information we can affect change
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:10.120]  and they're going to do anything but show that side of us when it is in fact you know the majority
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:14.520]  of the protesters aren't anarchists you know they're they're well-meaning people and the anarchists
[2:48:14.520 --> 2:48:18.600]  are just totally lost they're what the media is going to focus on it's totally disgusting all right
[2:48:18.600 --> 2:48:25.560]  let's jump to mark in florida mark what's on your mind mark you there i wanted to talk to you uh
[2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:32.440]  about internet too but i i guess maybe that's a little bit off topic too uh and i i i want to
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:36.840]  make a suggestion and i'd rather do that while you were there rather than alex because i don't
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:41.640]  you know i sometimes he doesn't take too well through his suggestions but it's not really
[2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:46.200]  suggesting all right let's hear it a thought suggestion yeah i was thinking if you get something
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:52.600]  like a netflix going like if internet two strikes you know suddenly well i'll say this when you
[2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:57.800]  say netflix netflix contacted us about loose change so loose change could be on netflix the problem
[2:48:57.800 --> 2:49:01.320]  with that is they're all sorts of legal issues i think jones would be able to get around those
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:06.760]  legal issues i'm pretty sure endgame is also available via netflix because it was put out by
[2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:12.120]  the dis info company gary badly in that group which is also pretty big it is a tough road i
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:16.360]  don't disagree with you maybe we could talk about internet to some other time mark i'm going to jump
[2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:22.440]  right now uh back to red beckman red how can people get your stuff you say you don't have a website
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:29.720]  can they contact you via email well the best way to just uh i i don't dare get my email out it's
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:39.000]  already overloaded i got you um i uh i just give my address just red beckman um p o box six one
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:47.320]  carols uh washington that's c a r r o l l s carols washington
[2:49:47.880 --> 2:49:57.160]  nine eight six oh nine is the zip um we'll send anybody that'll send a five dollar bill i i
[2:49:57.160 --> 2:50:04.120]  hope people will kind of um try to uh send cash rather than checks because checks are becoming
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:13.480]  hard to handle uh hard to process uh money orders and and uh and green works best and uh but we'll
[2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:20.120]  send them a copy of walls in our minds and some other material and um they'll uh they'll get
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:27.080]  five dollars worth because uh it's it's a dollar sixty eight just to send that passage package out
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:33.160]  by us males so it's not a money making thing i've never been in this thing for the money
[2:50:33.160 --> 2:50:38.520]  i've never i've spent a fortune uh of my own and none of us are really in this for the money
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:43.480]  we're really just trying to bring the people the truth and uh you know we we realize that good
[2:50:43.480 --> 2:50:48.760]  and evil do exist and unfortunately the powers that be are very very evil they don't have our
[2:50:48.760 --> 2:50:53.800]  best interests at heart we are looked at like chattel sheeple less than human we'll be back in

[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:25.160]  have you uh... very little uh... i um... i can only stomach so much of that
[2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:31.400]  um... i i've i've gotten pretty good at identifying propaganda when i see it
[2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:37.000]  and uh... and reading between the lines on the newspapers and that type of thing
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:42.760]  um... the one thing i wanted to mention today was that we need to communicate with the veterans
[2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:48.680]  uh... i've been told that there's over thirty million u.s. of veterans of military
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:57.080]  uh... service in this country and when we went into the service we took an oath to defend the
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:56:03.320]  constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic they didn't tell us anything about
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:10.440]  the domestic enemies we weren't educated as to the fact that all great nations are always
[2:56:10.440 --> 2:56:18.280]  destroyed from within just as we're is happening to us right now in this country and uh... we were
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:25.000]  not taught that the domestic enemies are by far the most dangerous and the ones that we really
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:32.040]  have to pay attention to and and of course your videos of alex jones and and and all the different
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:38.200]  people out there we're trying to communicate with american people how dangerous these domestic
[2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:48.120]  enemies are uh... the old does not say that the military that they have to obey uh... without
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:58.120]  question the orders of the so-called uh... commander in chief we're supposed to be looking at
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:04.760]  at what the uh... politicians and such are doing we're supposed to be able to have a working
[2:57:04.760 --> 2:57:11.880]  knowledge of the constitution for the united states of america and when we see uh... domestic
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:19.720]  enemies violating the constitution we must do something and we need to communicate with the
[2:57:19.720 --> 2:57:27.960]  american veterans in this country uh... because they have been misguided misled and uh... i i was
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:33.720]  a victim of it i i i i i uh... swallowed their propaganda back in the korean war
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:39.400]  and uh... and and that's one of the things that has bothered me over the years
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:46.680]  and caused me to uh... do what i'm doing uh... domestic enemies uh... we have to
[2:57:47.400 --> 2:57:55.320]  do what we can to bring these people to justice and we know how to do it with the grand juries

[3:00:29.800 --> 3:00:40.840]  the relationship between bin laden and the cia was essentially uh he was one of the assets one
[3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:45.560]  of the people they could turn to they wanted something done they went to bin laden in the
[3:00:45.560 --> 3:00:52.200]  early 1980s bin laden worked with operatives from us intelligence the pakistani military and arab
[3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:58.600]  states is it not true that the united states government paid 300 million dollars to the bin
[3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:08.440]  laden family for the construction of the military camps at basis though i really think that these
[3:01:08.440 --> 3:01:14.200]  were more cia assets people that were recruited like uh all of the folks i've been issuing visas to
[3:01:15.560 --> 3:01:21.560]  then we have that mysterious suitcase with all of the hijacker's names and all of this incriminating
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:26.920]  evidence why put a coran why put flight manuals why put all this incriminating information if it's
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:39.320]  supposedly going to get burned up let's show you some video that was taken eight days after 9
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:45.880]  11 that man there is osama bin laden's younger brother khalil and that family that took off
[3:01:45.880 --> 3:01:52.040]  that's a crime i was surprised uh at the evidence that there were foreign governments involved
[3:01:52.040 --> 3:01:59.720]  most of that information is classified i think overly classified
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:09.640]  osama bin laden osama bin laden osama bin laden remember 24 hours ago it was the bush tax cut
[3:02:09.640 --> 3:02:15.400]  the bush budget the bush economy you don't hear anything about tonight it's america's enemy

[3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:36.120]  a caller brought up internet too and who knows if what we're doing today and all week here at
[3:02:36.120 --> 3:02:41.320]  info wars dot com and the alex joneshow is going to be possible when they bring an info or uh
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:45.960]  internet to and they say well you have to have a subdomain page and you got to be under this
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:52.280]  university or this corporation and we're going to decide what kind of content is truly approval
[3:02:53.160 --> 3:02:57.160]  what's the what's what what can we really let people see and then they're also going to charge
[3:02:57.160 --> 3:03:01.880]  you per bandwidth so that bandwidth right there that you're watching i mean that's live streaming
[3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:07.800]  video uh it's probably a little bit heavier than youtube and say you watch that all day or you leave
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:12.760]  it on loop they're going to say oh look at you being so greedy on the internet you're already
[3:03:12.760 --> 3:03:16.840]  paying a monthly fee but you went over your bandwidth so you're going to pay an extra 25
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:22.760]  dollars this month excuse me oh yeah they're already testing here in bowmont texas not sure
[3:03:22.760 --> 3:03:27.320]  where bowmont is but uh it was reported i was on the alex joneshow a little over a month ago
[3:03:27.320 --> 3:03:32.120]  discussing this very topic and not only are they going to bring that in but they've already kind
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:36.520]  of introduced this as the cool hip way to you know make sure that your information secure and
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:39.880]  they're going to put biometric thumb scanners on your little keyboard or your laptop and they've
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:44.920]  already done that with some of the new ibm thinkpads only instead of being in your own little database
[3:03:44.920 --> 3:03:49.640]  it's going to be in a government database and you will constantly be logged on as yourself no
[3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:56.680]  matter what ip address you're on from any computer in this new internet too constantly tracked and
[3:03:56.680 --> 3:04:02.920]  traced beyond anything you know you thought was possible before so internet too is bad news we
[3:04:02.920 --> 3:04:06.920]  have to make people aware that it even exists too they're promoting it as something that's
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:12.040]  going to be great for content lots more 3d content lots more television more integrated

[3:08:14.360 --> 3:08:20.600]  has the video that he's looking for it's a front on view and basically what happens is two guys come
[3:08:20.600 --> 3:08:26.600]  up and they say hey alex we're from chicago and they're wearing a obama hat and like this really
[3:08:26.600 --> 3:08:31.960]  fruity hat right these skin as an obama hat on and it's it's funny because it's like a uh...
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:38.840]  a black panther styled beret with obama on it's completely silly but uh... you know they identify
[3:08:38.840 --> 3:08:46.280]  themselves they say hey we're fans we're from uh... chicago and then it's a frontal on view of them
[3:08:46.280 --> 3:08:53.480]  saying uh... what alex has been accused of saying and then as michelle goes away alex says get
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:09:01.000]  michelle get michelle uh... referring to the camp again telling him to stay on her yeah obviously

[3:09:29.080 --> 3:09:35.320]  breckman being on there today uh... i have an interesting letter out of the urwin chef's federal
[3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:42.200]  mafia where it's signed by joseph batten committee on the judiciary in 1991 you're talking about it right
[3:09:42.840 --> 3:09:49.480]  batten joseph batten he states in this letter that all felonies are entitled 18 the united
[3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:56.840]  states code however one exception is that drug offenses are open crime control act been titled
[3:09:56.840 --> 3:10:04.440]  21 well income tax appears in title 26 it's not in title 18 there's nothing about income tax and
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:10.840]  title 18 so therefore there cannot be no income tax crimes or funny well tell that to westley
[3:10:10.840 --> 3:10:15.320]  snipes who he got off on most of the charges but they're still trying to make them do two to three
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:20.360]  years in federal prison uh... with you know these these lesser charges but they're trying to you
[3:10:20.360 --> 3:10:24.120]  know charge them to the full extent of the law that's how they do things they shake you down
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:27.960]  they are truly a mafia thanks for the call john i'd like to hear it

[3:10:33.240 --> 3:10:38.280]  hey jason i was on briefly yesterday and um i didn't get to plug my band's website but today
[3:10:38.280 --> 3:10:42.440]  when i heard alex was under attack i just wanted to call back and offer some words of support
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:49.320]  i watched the michelle malcon confrontation and alex is the man he's a peaceful warrior
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:55.640]  info warrior standing up for truth and justice and he honors life he keeps every step sacred
[3:10:55.640 --> 3:11:01.240]  and would never call for the death of anyone so to to accuse him is to is to bear false witness
[3:11:01.240 --> 3:11:07.960]  because it's not his character um he would much rather debate in a supine fashion and and win on
[3:11:07.960 --> 3:11:13.640]  the merits like he always does and it just upset me that they're going after him was such fervor
[3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:18.520]  and you know i'm just i stand with him you know in spirit if i could be there physically i would
[3:11:18.520 --> 3:11:23.960]  but i'm a working class info warrior and i'm just doing what i can you know in my hometown and uh

[3:14:55.320 --> 3:14:59.960]  maybe rent out a hotel room maybe a movie theater something of that sort and you know just try to
[3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:04.360]  gather people in the same area together you know because i feel like that the movement well it's
[3:15:04.360 --> 3:15:08.440]  probably gonna happen i mean it happened with loose change second edition it happened with loose
[3:15:08.440 --> 3:15:12.840]  change final cut i've been all over the country it's really up to people like you man i can't do
[3:15:12.840 --> 3:15:17.960]  it all and i know theaters cost money i know events cost money promotion costs money and if
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:23.000]  people are willing to put up that money i always give them the theater take and basically i make
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:27.560]  whatever i can offer dvds and t-shirts and you know they have to bring me out there and i have to
[3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:31.480]  have the time to do it but you're more than welcome to set up you know private screenings in your own
[3:15:31.480 --> 3:15:37.320]  home in schools in colleges on public access we try to make it available for as many people
[3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:42.360]  as possible and i try to do what i can but you know alex is pretty dead on if you spend too much
[3:15:42.360 --> 3:15:47.160]  time traveling you're not able to put these projects together i mean this project took me
[3:15:47.160 --> 3:15:53.560]  a good three four months to really piece together and that's not even involving the writing or you
[3:15:53.560 --> 3:15:58.200]  know getting you know actually archiving the clips that let literally you know i was doing that while
[3:15:58.200 --> 3:16:02.840]  i was uh working on loose change final cut so it's a very extensive process and i hope i can
[3:16:02.840 --> 3:16:07.560]  travel around too you can you can bet that you'll see me in places like jersey maybe boston uh you
[3:16:07.560 --> 3:16:11.880]  know northeast corners a lot easier for me because i can drive and i've got a car now so it's a

[3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:52.520]  endeavoring to get the american people to do which is to pay attention which is to understand what's
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:59.320]  going on which is to hold the politicians and statesmen accountable and and more important
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:06.520]  than anything else is to truly take accountable action and understand the foundational premises

[3:19:12.440 --> 3:19:18.520]  with respect to um it's due to a complete lack of knowledge of the constitution and bill of

[3:24:53.320 --> 3:24:58.760]  the know and those that think this is a little bit on the fringe get informed start paying
[3:24:58.760 --> 3:25:04.760]  attention uh... start reading uh... because these are very very serious times and these
[3:25:04.760 --> 3:25:12.520]  are extremely egregious and wicked people in our places and then also i would like to save
[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:18.520]  for all the good people all the people that that want to live a good clean moral life the
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:25.080]  the christians the jews uh... i myself am a christian and i uh... believe uh... that we
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:29.240]  should be good to our fellow man we should should do what is right among other things
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:34.520]  and i think it's incumbent upon us to to hold people up that are walking into in integrity
[3:25:34.520 --> 3:25:40.360]  and trying to do what's right such as mr jones and such as mr burmese and really pray for them
[3:25:40.360 --> 3:25:46.200]  really pray that good will come and that the people that are doing these horrible things
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:51.000]  or really be held accountable because that's the one thing that will deal with them as a high
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:57.720]  degree of accountability and uh... and uh... and informed citizenry with you i thank you so much
[3:25:57.720 --> 3:26:01.560]  for the kind words judy and uh... yeah we do need to hold them accountable i'm going to be
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:04.920]  going after these guys long after the bush administration is out of office
[3:26:04.920 --> 3:26:08.120]  we need to hold cheney accountable we need to hold rumsfeld accountable we need to hold
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:14.040]  wolfwoods accountable we even need to uh... hold the puppet king george w bush who was nothing
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:18.840]  but a you know rich intelligence guys kid accountable for what he knew after the the fact
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:21.800]  we can't let these guys get away with it i'm with you a hundred percent again
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:26.120]  thank you for those kind words let's jump to bar in texas bar what's on your mind
[3:26:26.120 --> 3:26:31.640]  hey jason i wanted to touch back for a second on this whole this malcon confrontation because
[3:26:31.640 --> 3:26:36.840]  it kind of hit the sore spot with me okay uh... that i've that i've just continually noticed
[3:26:36.840 --> 3:26:44.440]  that that i want to talk about is that the left and the leftists really do hate alex jones and i
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:49.240]  see that they i encounter this a lot in my own work with you know trying to spread this kind
[3:26:49.240 --> 3:26:56.520]  of information and i think it's two primary things one is alex has really re-energized the entire
[3:26:56.520 --> 3:27:03.080]  patriot libertarian movement and that is you know just on the face value taking away from
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:08.360]  their organizations you know absolutely really brought the whole the whole patriot resistor
[3:27:09.080 --> 3:27:12.440]  back into the forefront of things and that's just tapping their movement
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:16.680]  so i mean that that's one end of the spectrum and the other end of the spectrum is if you
[3:27:16.680 --> 3:27:22.200]  read linen and you read about the way communism is supposed to be implemented is that you have to
[3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:27.960]  vilify all other social movements you have to destroy every other social movement so that
[3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:34.440]  your social movement is the only movement that has any real power or credibility so i mean i'm
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:39.880]  not saying that it's this mastermind plot on on the on the on from the leftist faction but it's
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:46.040]  really kind of this whole gambit of of hate and strategy well hold on how goofy is it that the guy
[3:27:46.040 --> 3:27:51.800]  that's supposedly leading this you know leftist quote unquote anarchist group dressed up like
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:57.000]  mickey maus from fantasia to quote unquote levitate the mint you know what i'm saying
[3:27:57.640 --> 3:28:02.840]  no i completely agree it's it's a clown costume you know malkin loves to show up and get pictures
[3:28:02.840 --> 3:28:08.040]  of that because that just reinforces the whole rep left right paradigm because then some guy out
[3:28:08.040 --> 3:28:12.760]  in california that's just middle america and buys into the whole you know schmorgas board of lies
[3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:18.280]  looks at that goes my god these people are absolute moron absolutely i'm saying absolutely
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:23.880]  then if you share those views you know you must be an absolute moron so you know i just i really
[3:28:23.880 --> 3:28:28.920]  encourage people to to do that you know break through that you're not going to get through
[3:28:28.920 --> 3:28:33.800]  to the leaders but do your best don't know and the other danger here is don't allow them
[3:28:33.800 --> 3:28:40.200]  to suck us into the same cycle of confrontation with them we our message is above that we're
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:43.880]  really trying to have effective change and the most effective change is not to allow them
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:49.320]  to polarize us we have to break through their own conditioning i'm wasting thank you so much
[3:28:49.320 --> 3:28:55.320]  for the call bar we got a lot of work to do in this country luckily alex jones is doing a lot
[3:28:55.320 --> 3:29:00.520]  of that work for us over at the dnc right now live streaming over at info wars dot com if you

[3:29:45.800 --> 3:29:50.600]  fabled enemies is the first 9 11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[3:29:50.600 --> 3:29:55.480]  networks inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are israelis

[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:31.560]  on the way they're looking more and more is going down every single day all right we got a ton of
[3:33:31.560 --> 3:33:36.040]  collars and like i said i take them all so let's jump to nate in indiana nate what's on your mind
[3:33:37.400 --> 3:33:40.280]  nate dropped out all right that's all right let's go to roger in minnesota then
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:46.200]  roger what's up hey jason uh... well as everybody said kudos to you great job great job
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:51.560]  dallas one question that i have something that's intrigued me for quite some time uh...
[3:33:52.200 --> 3:33:59.400]  is uh... with the assassination of several members of the kennedy family how can the living
[3:33:59.400 --> 3:34:05.960]  kennedy family members uh... endorse people like obama and whatever that they have to have
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:11.880]  no one what was behind their family members getting killed i just i don't know i can't
[3:34:11.880 --> 3:34:18.040]  comprehend it well i'll tell you what it is it's the graves of john kennedy and john kennedy jr
[3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:23.160]  i mean uh... if you watch jfk to the bush connection uh... it really lays out a case for
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:29.640]  george h w bush's involvement in the assassination of kennedy and this whole you know power struggle
[3:34:29.640 --> 3:34:34.440]  between that faction of uh... i guess you would quote quote the establishment and joe kennedy's
[3:34:34.440 --> 3:34:40.680]  faction now after they killed uh... john they killed robert right at the moment that he was
[3:34:40.680 --> 3:34:46.440]  going to win the uh... the democratic nominee i mean he was at the uh... california primary
[3:34:46.440 --> 3:34:53.000]  where he won so i mean there's two dead bodies now robert kennedy jr goes about as far as anybody
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:59.160]  on the left will um... he's had uh... you know dylan uh... myself on the radio on his radio show
[3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:03.720]  he's open to a lot of aspects of nine eleven truth it's rather surprising he's a rather good
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:08.760]  speaker and who knows maybe he's setting himself up to be you know running for president i'm not
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:15.800]  sure ted kennedy also i mean went through that whole chap aquatic thing and has been silence ever
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:19.400]  silent ever since basically i think they give you a choice when you're at that
[3:35:19.400 --> 3:35:25.800]  uh... establishment level go along or you're going to get killed and uh... even with caroline
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:31.720]  kennedy man was her own father for god's sake i hear you man but i mean just look at jackie
[3:35:31.720 --> 3:35:37.160]  oh she kept quiet and tried to raise her kids under the radar and you know she wasn't successful
[3:35:37.160 --> 3:35:41.960]  and you know letting them keep their hands off of john i mean he put out a mainstream magazine
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:46.360]  he had a legitimate shot at the presidency he had a legitimate shot of reopening the
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:50.840]  investigations into his uncle and father's murder and then all the sudden his plane goes down
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:56.280]  uh... actually the same guy that the jfk two did a uh... john f kennedy jr documentary as well as
[3:35:56.280 --> 3:36:00.760]  names john hanky i've interviewed him he's uh... he's a hell of a researcher but i think fear
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:05.480]  plays into it even on those all those own uh... those establishment levels not everybody
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:09.960]  is as righteous as you are me you know what i'm saying but somebody like caroline kennedy
[3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:15.320]  even though it if it was fear with a motoring factor they wouldn't kill her i don't think
[3:36:15.320 --> 3:36:20.360]  we're not necessarily supporting obama so how can she do that when she knows what happened to her
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:24.360]  father i just don't get it well you know they're still stuck in these left right politics they
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:28.760]  probably see a lot of other things behind the scenes that we don't see i'm sure that they are
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:33.960]  believers in the lesser of two evils but i you know to say that they wouldn't kill her i i i don't
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:38.200]  think that they would put a pass killer i could see a car accident thank you for the call i don't
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:44.520]  think anybody is above these assassins bullets especially not a kennedy uh... we're even caroline
[3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:49.000]  kennedy i mean that's just my personal opinion all right let's jump to mike in tennessee mike
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:50.200]  what's on your mind
[3:36:50.200 --> 3:36:55.560]  good afternoon this is called backman who may be listening if not mr bagman tune in in another
[3:36:55.560 --> 3:37:00.440]  four hours and re-catch the broadcast but we need your help uh... we need you to prepare a
[3:37:00.440 --> 3:37:06.040]  presentation that we can direct it veterans jurors because they understand the concept of
[3:37:06.040 --> 3:37:10.440]  defending our republic and the constitution against all enemies foreign domestic well i'll
[3:37:10.440 --> 3:37:14.680]  say this hold on there is uh... quite a few presentations by red backman already up at
[3:37:14.680 --> 3:37:19.480]  youtube so if you have internet access you can see those okay what's the website
[3:37:19.480 --> 3:37:22.520]  if you just go to youtube dot com and you just type in red backman
[3:37:22.520 --> 3:37:26.920]  i want a few of his lectures are up in separate parts i i checked it out before he came on
[3:37:26.920 --> 3:37:31.640]  well also there's a problem right now that the jury pools are being pre-screened by the
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:35.880]  government and the jury's are being loaded up with the spouses of police officers government
[3:37:35.880 --> 3:37:39.640]  employees and and they're doing what they're told and they're otherwise beholding the government
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:45.400]  and also the jurors are being asked by the judges if they will follow the law as the judge
[3:37:45.400 --> 3:37:51.000]  instructs and if the jury says anything other than yes or indicates they were also just a law
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:56.360]  well they're booted off the jury and the judge never tells the jury that they judge not only the facts
[3:37:56.360 --> 3:38:00.920]  but also the law well there's no doubt that our court system especially in this country is
[3:38:00.920 --> 3:38:05.720]  completely and totally rigged and in light of a miracle the average citizen doesn't really have
[3:38:05.720 --> 3:38:09.560]  that much of a chance against the state or the district attorney i thank you for the call
[3:38:10.520 --> 3:38:14.520]  we have to keep standing up for ourselves you know we we just have to keep saying well you
[3:38:14.520 --> 3:38:17.800]  know that's against the constitution bill rights and yeah there are a lot of corrupt judges out
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:21.800]  there are a lot of judges on the take there are a lot of judges that are just pompous and just
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:27.000]  arrogant with power uh that just speaks to the nature of the america citizen to me
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:31.720]  you know we feel a sense of entitlement and when we're given power we often abuse it why is that
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:35.640]  all right let's jump to howl in florida howl what's on your mind
[3:38:36.280 --> 3:38:40.760]  yeah jason i would have liked to have asked this question of red beckman but uh
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:48.360]  it's a problem that's being repeated thousands of times literally daily in this country and
[3:38:48.360 --> 3:38:58.120]  it's a violation of law now what i'm speaking of is uh a violation of recording your voice
[3:38:58.120 --> 3:39:07.240]  without your permission like in florida where i am it's a violation of chapter 934.01 prince c4
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:15.240]  to record your voice without your permission and when you use the telephone anytime nowadays
[3:39:15.240 --> 3:39:24.520]  you are informed by a machine and and i'll call it a machine it's a recorder it's not a person
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:33.320]  and so we'll just refer to it as a robot this robot records you uh and uh my question is
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:43.080]  can you be faced in court by a robot as your accuser number one and i have complained to
[3:39:43.080 --> 3:39:49.240]  at&t about this i've complained to public service commission i've complained to the federal
[3:39:49.240 --> 3:39:54.920]  communications commission i've even called a lawyer about it and i get no satisfactory
[3:39:54.920 --> 3:40:03.560]  answer that they can get by by recording your voice without your permission and uh if uh they can
[3:40:03.560 --> 3:40:10.680]  do it with a machine who am i going to charge with this third class felony uh in violation of
[3:40:10.680 --> 3:40:14.920]  florida law well they've eviscerated the constitution and bill of rights and i don't think that there
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:19.480]  is a law that says that this guy that the computer can charge you what they'll do is they'll say
[3:40:19.480 --> 3:40:25.720]  uh whatever computer that department belongs to now you mentioned at&t uh about six months ago
[3:40:25.720 --> 3:40:30.040]  there was a gentleman that blew the whistle on at&t saying that they had the secret room and he was
[3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:35.000]  the it professional that basically attended that secret room where they were we where they were
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:40.120]  copying uh records of all phone conversations all emails uh whatsoever it was thrown out of federal
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:45.960]  court now he tried to sue them and uh that was also thrown out with a supreme court decision so
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:51.320]  unfortunately i would say you probably in the system that it stands today not the true constitution
[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:56.920]  and bill of rights system you have little to no argument with this new national security apparatus
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:41:01.560]  this new military industrial complex that is literally literally taken over our country and
[3:41:01.560 --> 3:41:05.640]  i'm not saying that's the right thing i'm saying it's the complete wrong thing and it's totally
[3:41:05.640 --> 3:41:10.600]  against the law but until we bring these bastards that are doing this out in the open to justice
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:15.560]  and we reverse the decision by the supreme court we have little to no recourse i thank you for the
[3:41:15.560 --> 3:41:22.920]  call how let's jump to ken in new york ken what's on your mind yeah well jason yes yes this can
[3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:28.280]  uh i'm actually on a long island and i have to say that right now this is probably the most
[3:41:28.280 --> 3:41:33.240]  brainwashed area of the country it's pretty bad man i mean i go to long island a lot and you know
[3:41:33.240 --> 3:41:39.560]  it's all about blowouts and uh popped collars and some trendy bar where i'm going to spend $8
[3:41:39.560 --> 3:41:45.880]  on a beer and $15 on a mixed drink and people are totally gone from reality it's all about going
[3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:50.680]  to the shore and the hamptons and what car i drive and how much gels in my hair it's pretty
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:55.880]  sickening yeah it is i mean beyond the uh the superficial nature of that like you're saying
[3:41:55.880 --> 3:42:01.400]  but i'm just saying just like the working person i mean they just don't but i also noticed lately
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:05.880]  that people are waking up a little bit mm-hmm well i think in the city you see a lot more people
[3:42:05.880 --> 3:42:10.680]  waking up in clinton in the bronce and in brooklyn it's because those people are working class people
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:15.480]  and then they don't have this aristocratic elitist attitude man you know i went to school in upstate
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:19.640]  new york with a lot of uh friends from long island actually when i take off on thursday i'm going to a
[3:42:19.640 --> 3:42:25.240]  long island wedding you know and uh you know my my ex-girls from long island and they just they
[3:42:25.240 --> 3:42:30.280]  just are just on another level of non-reality it's you kind of feel a sense of entitlement
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:33.720]  if you didn't grow up in long island and you're able to move there yeah you have you noticed
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:37.640]  that they're like oh i i live on long island now yeah well the newest thing on long island is the
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:42.520]  mcmanchin well they instead of building like communities where the average person can afford
[3:42:42.520 --> 3:42:45.720]  a house uh-huh for the last 10 years all the contractors have been building you know they're
[3:42:45.720 --> 3:42:50.360]  buying a piece of property they used to put 50 houses on and putting 10 mm-hmm well that's why
[3:42:50.360 --> 3:42:55.080]  you do that but a profit margin on it oh yeah well that's why i'm down at ground zero man it's not
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:42:59.320]  for those long island creeps although if they want to listen they can i mean i'm not against people
[3:42:59.320 --> 3:43:03.880]  that are able to make it in this world and go out there but the the attitude man the elitist
[3:43:03.880 --> 3:43:08.520]  attitude of these people it's something that's kind of unbelievable if you're not a new yorker and
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:13.400]  you don't know it uh i mean i'm out in texas people really can't relate but really they treat you
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:18.760]  like you're less of a person they send their kids to college in eddie bower mobiles and you know
[3:43:18.760 --> 3:43:25.000]  2006 luxury sedans and these kids have no grip on reality they literally got like an eight or
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:29.640]  nine hundred on their sat there in a state school they have no idea what they're they want in life
[3:43:29.640 --> 3:43:35.080]  they leave college and then they go and move back in with their parents most of the time i mean
[3:43:35.080 --> 3:43:38.920]  dude it's a sick culture there i know a lot of people who do that i know people have families
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:43.160]  because it's you know the fact of the matter is is with all the people who are moving here
[3:43:43.160 --> 3:43:47.640]  for that the mic mansion thing you know they were made some money in the stock market or
[3:43:47.640 --> 3:43:52.200]  they became lawyers or whatever thought basically i grew up on long island and when i was a kid we
[3:43:52.200 --> 3:43:57.720]  made things we put a man on the moon you know i mean neighbors were engineers my friends father
[3:43:57.720 --> 3:44:02.360]  built his business by working nights building the long island expressway so he can afford his
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:06.600]  own business you know people worked they actually were people who are getting ahead in the world
[3:44:06.600 --> 3:44:10.840]  now it's all nothing but doctors and lawyers and bankers well absolutely well people are
[3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:15.000]  struggling papers for living yeah there's no room for blue collar workers in the island anymore
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:20.280]  unless you got your hair your house 25 years ago and it's also an angle of brainwashing too
[3:44:20.280 --> 3:44:25.480]  because if you talk to older people like i'm 43 i'm like right at the beginning of the gen x
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:31.160]  generation i see my friends and people younger than me either leaving or finding it very difficult
[3:44:31.160 --> 3:44:36.040]  to make a living here yeah no mine too man i mean a lot of my friends well you know a couple of them
[3:44:36.040 --> 3:44:40.520]  have paid a lot of money to go again live out in queens or the bronx and they work into manhattan
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:44.600]  but you know their parents grew up in long island they just can't afford it and like you said more
[3:44:44.600 --> 3:44:48.920]  and more elitists will move in there what really bothers me there is again the the
[3:44:48.920 --> 3:44:53.560]  willingness not to even look at this stuff this is the problem the apathetic oh well you
[3:44:53.560 --> 3:44:57.720]  know what i got a big screen television i'm in a nice area i drive a nice car i could care less
[3:44:57.720 --> 3:45:02.680]  about politics i don't need to tell you anything that isn't on cnn or msnbc that should be enough
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:07.400]  for you all people are hooked they are the funny thing is i i do find more people are listening
[3:45:07.400 --> 3:45:13.160]  now but also i find the people who are against it are even angrier when you say it so it's almost
[3:45:13.160 --> 3:45:17.240]  like we're being polarized a little bit like there are people out there who maybe they didn't get
[3:45:17.240 --> 3:45:20.600]  angry but they were afraid to just say anything well one of the great things about that area is
[3:45:20.600 --> 3:45:25.400]  at least you guys have wba i that broadcast pretty broad and they're they're not the greatest they're
[3:45:25.400 --> 3:45:29.240]  a little leftist but they do broadcast a bit of the truth i thank you for the call can i hope
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:33.560]  you call me later in the week all right let's jump to tim in wisconsin tim what's on your mind
[3:45:34.520 --> 3:45:41.160]  hi um even though i didn't make it on time with with red beckman the thing i felt i'd still
[3:45:41.160 --> 3:45:46.600]  feel they felt they felt was still good to say to you is about how much i just read couldn't
[3:45:46.600 --> 3:45:51.320]  help agreeing with red beckman about how we're supposed to be the enforcers of the constitution
[3:45:51.320 --> 3:45:56.040]  and i just wish i could get them in a lot of churches to realize that because i haven't
[3:45:56.040 --> 3:46:00.520]  tried to wake them up in a few churches the problem is that we're in a society that feels
[3:46:00.520 --> 3:46:06.120]  like it's entitled to something they don't understand that without actual citizens knowing
[3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:10.520]  about understanding and defending the constitution of bill and bill of rights we're going to have
[3:46:10.520 --> 3:46:15.320]  nothing but tyranny in this country and that the thing i said about the response um well the thing
[3:46:15.320 --> 3:46:20.520]  i can only remember the response of one of them for sure you know saying stuff like uh
[3:46:21.400 --> 3:46:27.640]  well christianity it isn't supposed to be a isn't supposed to be a political movement it's a spiritual
[3:46:27.640 --> 3:46:32.120]  movement and and other kind of christian rationalizations that you know they can come up with
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:37.400]  well i thank you for the call tim and uh yeah i mean i'm upset with the slave class
[3:46:37.400 --> 3:46:44.200]  that is the supposed you know citizenship of america that's what we are we're disgusting lazy
[3:46:44.200 --> 3:46:48.600]  slaves and that's not all of us but it's the majority of us i'm guilty of it too at times
[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:52.760]  you know i'm not perfect you know i'll probably sit down when i get home and watch some simpsons
[3:46:52.760 --> 3:46:59.800]  i miss or some family guy or catch up on my uh my yankees when i get home but that's all secondary
[3:46:59.800 --> 3:47:07.080]  that's maybe even third now it's not primary my primary concern is my family and my friends and
[3:47:07.080 --> 3:47:11.560]  in order to protect them and protect myself i have to inform myself every day of what's
[3:47:11.560 --> 3:47:16.280]  really going on in the world i have to look at all angles and i feel like i've got a better chance
[3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:21.800]  of survival and a better chance of living in a constitutional republic if i share that information
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:26.040]  with those friends and families and even perfect strangers and this great audience
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:29.880]  all right let's jump to tony in canada tony what's on your mind
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:38.600]  i'm here yes i'm just seeing right now on cnn that they're reporting there's a glitch with the faa
[3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:43.080]  are you guys seeing that uh i don't have cnn in front of me why don't you tell me what they're
[3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:49.000]  talking about uh they're not sure exactly yet but it's just saying that uh there's a problem
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:53.480]  with the information going through and they can't have any contact with the with the uh with the
[3:47:53.480 --> 3:47:59.320]  planes you're telling me that all faa communication in this country is shut down right now and they
[3:47:59.320 --> 3:48:03.240]  can't communicate with commercial airliners i'm not i'm not going to see that's 100 percent
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:08.280]  certain but that's just what i'm reading here is what it sounds like wow well let me jump to cnn.com
[3:48:08.280 --> 3:48:13.960]  right now and see if that is in fact the case if that is being reported that would be a huge story
[3:48:13.960 --> 3:48:19.000]  um that's reckless i mean we could have planes running into each other i mean that is a uh
[3:48:19.640 --> 3:48:25.160]  that is an essential service and i and i hope that you're wrong i mean that could cause oh no
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:29.960]  breaking news well that's faa computer problems causing delays all right so that might not be
[3:48:29.960 --> 3:48:36.920]  quite as serious as it's being shut down let's see uh it's still loading sorry folks all right
[3:48:36.920 --> 3:48:41.400]  communication problems at the federal aviation administration facility that processes flight
[3:48:41.400 --> 3:48:45.320]  plans we're causing flight delays at airports across the united states tuesday afternoon the
[3:48:45.320 --> 3:48:49.880]  administration said the facility south of alana is having problems processing data requiring
[3:48:49.880 --> 3:48:54.200]  that all flight plan information be processed through a facility in salt lake city utah so i
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:59.320]  guess they are communicating someone with planes um the two facilities process all flight plans for
[3:48:59.320 --> 3:49:03.880]  commercial and general aviation flights in the united states the faa said the faa said there are
[3:49:03.880 --> 3:49:08.760]  no radar outages that's good and said they have not lost contact with any planes okay also good
[3:49:08.760 --> 3:49:13.240]  okay all right all right sorry guys that's all right hey you know that's why we like this cutting

[3:54:25.400 --> 3:54:31.160]  and these political parties have been hijacked by these globalists their new world order puppets
[3:54:31.160 --> 3:54:35.080]  and the distraction to what really needs to happen in this country so thank goodness you
[3:54:35.080 --> 3:54:41.080]  guys are exposing us because you do not see this media give us any resemblance of the truth
[3:54:41.080 --> 3:54:45.800]  absolutely nobody has to do it no no they're always trying to get you stuck into conservative
[3:54:45.800 --> 3:54:51.720]  or liberal left or right democrat or republican and you know they tried to attack coursey as a
[3:54:51.720 --> 3:54:56.440]  as a right winger when he went after obama he's like look man i'm i'm voting chuck baldwin i don't
[3:54:56.440 --> 3:55:00.440]  know what you're talking about it's pretty funny that he kind of denied nine eleven truth right
[3:55:00.440 --> 3:55:04.200]  there he's voting for the nine eleven truth candidate but it shows he's hit and he's just
[3:55:04.200 --> 3:55:07.880]  trying to sell a couple books you know he knows what's going on but more and more people not
[3:55:07.880 --> 3:55:11.640]  only have to know what's going on they have to make it acceptable to talk about and say man
[3:55:11.640 --> 3:55:14.200]  you're voting democrat or republican you're part of the problem
[3:55:14.200 --> 3:55:22.680]  no better this is a guy that is a new world order puppet he is a basically committed treason
[3:55:22.680 --> 3:55:27.640]  against this country and these are the people you don't think barack obama is some type of
[3:55:27.640 --> 3:55:32.760]  profit which is the biggest misconception that you have in the days media but with brainwashed
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:37.320]  idiots in this country oh yeah majority of their brainwashed yeah it's change you can vote for
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:41.720]  there'll be no change other than that appearance that democrats are in republicans are not the
[3:55:41.720 --> 3:55:47.080]  same elitists are behind him you can tell from his global world order speech out in berlin thank
[3:55:47.080 --> 3:55:52.280]  you very much frank he literally said again global citizenship you will do more not less in the

[3:56:47.000 --> 3:56:52.040]  government is commonplace it's talked about openly at hearings it's just that when you
[3:56:52.040 --> 3:56:55.560]  use the term shadow government most people want to believe that you're wearing a tinfoil hat and
[3:56:55.560 --> 3:57:00.520]  it doesn't exist because our globalist masters are supposed to love us and protect us and want to
[3:57:00.520 --> 3:57:07.720]  help us they'd never lie to us well unfortunately that is just not the case they constantly lie
[3:57:07.720 --> 3:57:12.920]  to us they constantly propagate to us they constantly try to take away our living conditions our
