[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:28.920]  all right folks this is going to be a particularly jam-packed broadcast today that you do not want
[00:28.920 --> 00:36.880]  to miss obviously with the tragic twin bombings killing 34 people at least in Brussels Belgium
[00:36.880 --> 00:46.080]  this just days after the ringleader of the Paris theater attack that killed over 130 people was
[00:46.080 --> 00:52.160]  captured clearly this is being done so that in case he talks they can go ahead and carry out
[00:52.160 --> 00:59.600]  operations that they already had planned and use those operations as a smoke screen to escape to
[00:59.600 --> 01:06.680]  the next city or the next country and because Muslim areas across Europe are complete no-go zones
[01:06.680 --> 01:15.200]  they can operate however they want Joe Big served three clusters in Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:15.200 --> 01:23.400]  and he said that he never saw such danger and hatred on average even though he was blown
[01:23.400 --> 01:28.360]  up twice in armored vehicles hit with shrapnel and a whole bunch of famous battles covered by
[01:28.360 --> 01:35.400]  Rolling Stone and others Esquire you name it that that he had a worse sense of danger in
[01:35.400 --> 01:46.800]  Mozambique a suburb of Brussels Belgium then he had in Iraq or Afghanistan just from the
[01:46.800 --> 01:50.440]  general public and I kept saying get footage of them running you out he goes you understand
[01:50.440 --> 01:55.640]  they got cars coming at us people screaming at us out of doorways it's super dangerous we're
[01:55.640 --> 02:02.680]  getting out of there and I had Paul Watson and Joe Big's over there with a camera crew so we
[02:02.680 --> 02:12.840]  got 34 dead ISIS has taken responsibility Donald Trump has shown his geopolitical foxing us in
[02:12.840 --> 02:20.080]  that he told a pack yesterday just hours before this happened that NATO has been basically backing
[02:20.080 --> 02:29.160]  ISIS and is no friend of Israel and that's just true how astute Hollande Merkel France more than
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.880]  anybody has been backing al Qaeda and now Islamic State it's the elephant in the room all over
[02:35.880 --> 02:42.080]  the Middle East all over North Africa especially Libya and Syria and that's what's so frustrating
[02:42.080 --> 02:49.000]  about watching the communist Hollande the communist Merkel go we will stand strong against this
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.640]  terror we will keep the emergency going and take all your rights and arrest anybody whose
[02:54.640 --> 03:03.040]  right wing and criticizes Islam they bring them in unvetted they let them attack and then they
[03:03.040 --> 03:10.000]  take your rights this is the ultimate false flag in fact you guys get buckling in here I meant
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.760]  to shoot a Facebook mentions on this subject right before the show I didn't do it I'm gonna do it
[03:13.760 --> 03:21.080]  during the break it's so important it's having loaded up Brussels attacks are a false flag I
[03:21.080 --> 03:25.520]  want to go with that that all the enemies and detractors will come in and attack us national
[03:25.520 --> 03:29.840]  news will say that I said it didn't happen and then everyone will find the truth and millions
[03:29.840 --> 03:35.280]  will watch it it's a real Islamic attack but when you bring them in and you know they're gonna
[03:35.280 --> 03:43.160]  attack and you know a bunch of them are terror cells then you are aiding and abetting it is a
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.640]  false flag in fact guys there's a whole bunch of British and Dutch and French and German news and
[03:48.640 --> 03:55.480]  also Greek news please put me all the stories I just thought of this where they admitted quote
[03:55.480 --> 04:02.080]  over 500 of a known Islamic Sunni terror group have come in just from Greece alone in the last year
[04:02.080 --> 04:07.000]  that was a few months ago in mainstream news there's a bunch of others that they know the
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.080]  terrorists are coming in with the refugees and they're not vetting them by design just like
[04:11.080 --> 04:16.440]  Obama won't vet them and won't even look at their ID cards when they come in so Trump says we need
[04:16.440 --> 04:22.760]  to check their IDs and stop it until the IDs are checked and they call that outrageous and crazy
[04:22.760 --> 04:28.000]  when it's default common sense and also Donald Trump warned we're gonna play these clips coming
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.880]  up of what happened in Belgium and said it's gonna happen again and they said how outrageous he
[04:34.880 --> 04:41.160]  said there's no go areas huge areas of the city where you can't even go and our guys went in there
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.600]  with their cameras down their cameras hidden and we're told get out of restaurants get out of gas
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.920]  stations get off the street people driving up at them with cars threatening to kill them and the
[04:50.920 --> 04:55.880]  police won't even go in the areas in fact get the BBC footage ready of the crew being attacked last
[04:55.880 --> 05:03.080]  week in the very city Marines across the Corps will be challenged on their unconscious prejudice as
[05:03.080 --> 05:09.840]  women get the opportunity to become grunts for the first time reports military calm the military
[05:09.840 --> 05:15.080]  Corps is rolling out mandatory training for all Marines before the first future female

[08:59.600 --> 09:04.720]  ourselves during the collapse of society but he's gonna be coming in earlier today to obviously
[09:04.720 --> 09:12.800]  talk about the situation with the attacks in brussels belgium molambique one of the suburbs
[09:12.800 --> 09:23.280]  and other areas our crew people like joe bigs and paul joseph watson from london were there
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.960]  just a few months ago they got there within a day and a half two days of the attacks in paris
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.200]  they went into brussels belgium just an hour and a half away from paris inside belgium and they
[09:35.200 --> 09:41.760]  could not even go into many areas of the city couldn't go in a gas station couldn't go into a
[09:41.760 --> 09:47.120]  five and dime a drugstore couldn't get service at a restaurant they would walk in muslim men would
[09:47.120 --> 09:52.240]  jump up and scream you're not welcome get out and begin pushing them out they would begin
[09:52.240 --> 09:57.040]  trying to ram them with cars they would begin just screaming and yelling that they're basically
[09:57.040 --> 10:03.680]  going to kill them in arabic and and joe said three tours in iraq and afghanistan blown up
[10:03.680 --> 10:08.400]  twice in armored vehicles hit with shrapnel repeatedly that it was the most intense hatred
[10:08.400 --> 10:14.720]  he ever felt because most people in afghanistan and iraq did not hate them who has been brought into
[10:14.720 --> 10:22.800]  europe are exclusively hardcore wahhabist financed by saudi arabia we're going to go through all of
[10:22.800 --> 10:31.200]  this today hardcore radicals and actually if you go paul watson interviewed her just a few days
[10:31.200 --> 10:36.720]  ago in the fourth hour if you go to syrian girls page she has mainstream news articles documenting
[10:36.720 --> 10:42.480]  that the majority of people coming into syria are invaders to take the nation over they've had
[10:42.480 --> 10:48.000]  their butt kicked by the russians that's admitted they're now going through turkey who trained them
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.760]  into europe and being placed as sleeper cells by haland and by merkel and also by the leaders
[10:55.760 --> 11:03.040]  of brussels they have declared martial law in germany martial law in france they call it a
[11:03.040 --> 11:09.440]  permanent civil emergency banning free speech and arresting nationalist mainline leaders
[11:09.440 --> 11:15.840]  who aren't even as hardcore as donald trump so guns are everywhere you get a gun easier in
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.880]  brussels belgium than probably anywhere in europe the jihadists run around you've seen the videos
[11:20.880 --> 11:25.440]  nightly shooting their guns in the air the police are ordered by the government to stand down
[11:26.080 --> 11:31.600]  we aired footage yesterday in fact let's cue it up a bbc crew will even play some of the audio
[11:31.600 --> 11:38.960]  for radio listeners but obviously it is in uh i guess they speak flemish there it's it's and
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.240]  this is the bbc at the train station that that was attacked by the way one of the nearby train
[11:44.240 --> 11:50.800]  stations this is 60 minutes there's also bbc footage and they're beating up the camera people
[11:50.800 --> 11:57.840]  throwing rocks at them and attacking them because europeans are not allowed women are attacked people
[11:57.840 --> 12:06.320]  on wheelchairs are attacked in the video uh this this is the total abject complete arrogant
[12:06.320 --> 12:13.760]  hatred of radical islam merged with leftist brainwashing and entitlement drives his mobility scooter
[12:13.760 --> 12:22.400]  into the most violent attack so this is the leftist 60 minutes people being attacked
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.240]  this is the very area being attacked and again they're not allowed to have october fest they're
[12:32.240 --> 12:37.040]  not allowed to wear skirts they tell german women do not wear skirts if they are they are attacked
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.840]  they are bringing in radical jihadists by the millions from areas taken by them in libya
[12:45.280 --> 12:52.080]  and in syria it is all over the news that millions of invaders including with their families
[12:52.080 --> 12:59.760]  have come in behind the isis al qaeda jihadists saudi arabia funded and nato supported to invade
[12:59.760 --> 13:08.880]  the entire area and nato and the globalist think we are so dumb that we don't know that france
[13:08.880 --> 13:14.480]  quarterbacked the entire operation with merkel setting this up the last five years advertising
[13:14.480 --> 13:21.760]  that they could come to germany and to france and to brussels belgium and other areas and get free
[13:21.760 --> 13:28.320]  welfare get everything it's on video scores of times in germany and in other sweden you name it
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.240]  that the social workers come with free money and food and even when they're beat up and rape
[13:34.240 --> 13:40.640]  they go on the news and apologize for the racism of europe and say thank you for raping me that's
[13:40.640 --> 13:46.400]  actually in the news we've covered the stories they come with flowers to be beaten and attacked
[13:46.400 --> 13:53.920]  thanking them this is the total self-loving anti-european psycho hate that has been bred
[13:53.920 --> 14:00.640]  into them at the universities and this is society committing suicide in front of everyone
[14:02.240 --> 14:09.760]  just like we played the video yesterday at trump tower with a quote transgender man
[14:09.760 --> 14:15.840]  who's become a woman attacking the police attacking the horses the rest of them screaming
[14:15.840 --> 14:22.960]  epitets with muslims wearing headdresses standing with him in a muslim country almost every muslim
[14:22.960 --> 14:29.600]  country unless it was jordan or egypt they would stone that man that woman to death
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.160]  they would tear them apart limb from limb they would crucify them
[14:38.320 --> 14:44.080]  they don't care they know radical islam which is becoming the dominant takeover system
[14:44.080 --> 14:53.120]  absolutely hates the west and they are the muscle they want in here to organize the takedown now
[14:53.120 --> 14:56.320]  ladies and gentlemen we have an investigative reporter in the field right now i'm going to leave
[14:56.320 --> 15:06.080]  it at that and it should be breaking next week dealing with jihadis brought in from north africa
[15:06.080 --> 15:12.720]  in the middle east citizens in section 8 housing hispanic black and white being thrown out
[15:12.720 --> 15:20.800]  for minor violations like a flat tire a barbecue pit outside so they can move 20 to 30 to 40 people
[15:20.800 --> 15:27.040]  into one or two room apartments from north africa from the middle east and they are jihadis
[15:27.040 --> 15:33.040]  threatening the staff people are quitting they are giving them fake so well they're real social
[15:33.040 --> 15:37.600]  security numbers with fake names they're giving them new identities like the witness protection
[15:37.600 --> 15:43.760]  program under homeland security orders just like they ship illegals in from mexico and quote complete
[15:43.760 --> 15:50.960]  the smuggling process just like they fly people into dallas and la and new york city plain loads
[15:50.960 --> 16:01.040]  of 140 150 people every day and no ids are checked because they're bringing sleeper cells in that is
[16:01.040 --> 16:08.080]  the final takeover plan it's very clear now to hit every town every city and when they do they will
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.960]  declare civil emergency against everyone ban everybody's free speech and bring in a permanent
[16:12.960 --> 16:18.000]  emergency now being beta tested in europe and the political elite think we're so dumb
[16:20.240 --> 16:25.280]  that when a donald trump comes out and says brussel's belgium one of the most beautiful places in
[16:25.280 --> 16:30.880]  the world you can't go in half the city they'll beat you up and attack you if you do and they
[16:30.880 --> 16:37.040]  are in liberal globalist publications today time magazine newsweek you name it i've got stacks of
[16:37.040 --> 16:45.680]  the articles attacking donald trump saying can you believe him whoa he's over the top he said
[16:45.680 --> 16:53.040]  it's muslims that did this in europe today can you believe his hate they were saying that after ices
[16:53.040 --> 17:02.240]  took credit you go well that's just crediting to them no no no no not to their cult followers
[17:02.240 --> 17:06.880]  these people are enemies of this country ladies and gentlemen they are allied the mega banks
[17:06.880 --> 17:13.600]  george soros is allied with radical jihadist google funded the arab spring put al qaeda ices
[17:13.600 --> 17:19.920]  in charge apple facebook zuckerberg twitter all met i told you years ago we went to england to
[17:19.920 --> 17:25.600]  show you where they secretly met it was in the associated press yesterday that they ran the
[17:25.600 --> 17:35.360]  operations we know what we're talking about that's the reason army special forces command listens to
[17:35.360 --> 17:41.040]  us and this show that's the reason people in congress listen to this show it's the reason foreign
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.440]  leaders listen to this show because we know exactly what's going on and we'll talk about it but we're
[17:45.440 --> 17:53.200]  not the only ones this stuff is hidden in plain view the elite that are still pro west pro america
[17:54.960 --> 17:59.680]  and by elite i mean the the good hard work and strong defenders of this country and the world
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.240]  they listen to this broadcast because they already know what we're talking about they just use it to
[18:04.240 --> 18:08.560]  bounce ideas off of because it's the one place they can tune in and actually hear what's going on
[18:08.560 --> 18:13.760]  why do you think donald trump told apac yesterday hey listen nato doesn't like israel and you know it
[18:13.760 --> 18:21.280]  and apac went from booing him to clapping going wow because israel knows that nato has been funding
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.240]  isis and al-qaeda and israel also knows some elements of the israeli government have been
[18:26.240 --> 18:33.920]  part of that as well said truce comes out and says trump is crazy how dare him say we shouldn't be so
[18:33.920 --> 18:40.560]  close to nato because they're working with isis it's the fact that nato with headed up by france
[18:40.560 --> 18:49.280]  and turkey mainly ran the isis and al-qaeda takeover it's a fact it's been in congressional hearings
[18:49.280 --> 18:57.440]  ted cruise valiantly talked about it three years ago but not anymore he thinks this constituents
[18:57.440 --> 19:03.120]  are stupid and he can get points against trump for telling the truth now we come back i'm going to
[19:03.120 --> 19:09.360]  play this clip trump warned back in january brussels was in islamis's hellhole donald trump
[19:09.360 --> 19:15.280]  warned brussels months ago we're going to play those clips apac cheers trump thrashing obama
[19:15.280 --> 19:21.760]  criticizing nato ted cruise attacks donald trump for brussels johannes attacks then we got
[19:23.120 --> 19:31.120]  tim kennedy coming in studio to talk about it the third hour we have joe biggs from the studio
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.280]  and paul joes of watson from our studios in london joining us because they were both there in
[19:37.280 --> 19:43.280]  brussels less than two days just about a day and a half after the attacks and they went in they were
[19:43.280 --> 19:47.840]  there when the police first raided one house and killed one of the terrorists who had a suicide vest
[19:48.560 --> 19:53.120]  and these are real terror attacks but the globalists are opening the door up and bringing them in
[19:53.120 --> 20:00.160]  so it is a false slang stay with us ladies and gentlemen suffering from illness or disease
[20:00.160 --> 20:04.960]  frequently in pain overstressed always tired the solution is to oxygenate your cells because

[24:17.440 --> 24:28.800]  so kiddin and plain view look at this headline from the daily mail this is from february 18th
[24:28.800 --> 24:37.520]  2015 before the giant migrant wave came in the second wave into europe and look at the headline
[24:37.520 --> 24:43.760]  isis threatens to send 500 000 migrants to europe as a psychological weapon and chilling echo of
[24:43.760 --> 24:51.760]  kadoffee's prophecy that the mediterranean will be a sea of chaos they sent 2 million in the next
[24:51.760 --> 24:59.680]  year not 500 000 and they went on to say we'll have sleeper cells inside of them donald trump
[25:02.480 --> 25:08.240]  six seven months later when there was an attack in paris said we know terrorists are coming in
[25:08.240 --> 25:16.480]  with the refugees isis said they would use them and there were all those other attacks across europe
[25:17.680 --> 25:23.280]  and they said oh he's crazy he's horrible it's not true and i have stacks of articles since then
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.360]  where they admit terrorists are coming in and most of them 80 plus percent are military age men
[25:32.880 --> 25:36.240]  now correction because i tend to conflate things that is mix things together
[25:36.240 --> 25:39.040]  it was 60 minutes australia
[25:41.840 --> 25:48.720]  in stock home sweden that was attacked last week and it was a russian film crew
[25:48.720 --> 25:55.120]  attacked there in russells belgium there's just so many of these i tend to mix them all together
[25:55.120 --> 26:02.240]  the point is refugee aid groups you name it every day i see a new video of refugee aid groups trying
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.480]  to bring food or whatever to these people they just beat them up or it's all over the news that
[26:06.480 --> 26:12.640]  citizens in germany from cologne to paris france can't go to many of the train terminals without
[26:12.640 --> 26:18.240]  being beaten up and that's what's happening in sweden and in germany and in austria and just
[26:18.240 --> 26:25.280]  everywhere and the quote migrants are beating each other up as well it's just crazy lawlessness
[26:25.280 --> 26:31.360]  to just go to youtube type in migrants or refugees you know robbing drivers
[26:35.040 --> 26:40.960]  and they just rob drivers and rob 18 wheelers and just take over the channel and it was in
[26:40.960 --> 26:46.800]  the news last week the police don't even stop them now in england there were what five arrests last
[26:46.800 --> 26:52.080]  year as thousands a day just run through the police sit there should have a photo of an
[26:52.080 --> 26:58.800]  obese police officer in the newspaper just sitting there while this is happening this is a government
[26:58.800 --> 27:05.680]  order this is a takeover if you're a radio listener i'm showing all the articles and

[27:51.760 --> 27:58.560]  and then i went to google and typed in donald trump and guess what i saw three of the 10 or so
[27:58.560 --> 28:06.240]  articles at the top trump already blaming muslims and immigration for terror attacks
[28:07.120 --> 28:12.480]  and they go on these articles to act like did you hear what trump said he claimed that women
[28:12.480 --> 28:24.880]  wear lipstick did you hear trump claimed that men have chest hair i mean he's just saying things that
[28:24.880 --> 28:31.760]  are known fact but the media wants to act like it's crazy and weird so the left sees that has their
[28:31.760 --> 28:38.000]  minute of hate and then doesn't care when it comes out it's muslims five minutes later because
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.680]  they just want to hate donald trump because you know he's into sovereignty and prosperity and
[28:45.680 --> 28:51.360]  lower taxes and controlling our borders what a horrible horrible horrible man he was against

[38:20.560 --> 38:26.400]  the mainstream media is going to blame anybody including joe biggs or tim kennedy or alex shones
[38:26.400 --> 38:35.920]  or matt drudge or donald trump and the military by the way knows sure the military can be a tool
[38:35.920 --> 38:41.440]  the globalist to dominate and control us but because they have the decompartmentalization

[41:52.720 --> 41:56.960]  it's a no-brainer that when you bring five million people from war-torn zones who are
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.440]  a hobbyist jihadist who pledge the minute they get in they're going to kill everybody they start
[42:01.440 --> 42:06.720]  attacking everyone they're so hateful and the leftist governments say oh submit to them it's your
[42:06.720 --> 42:11.760]  fault we're going to arrest you if you criticize them don't wear short dresses that this is cultural
[42:11.760 --> 42:18.800]  terrorism and now you have these grips brought in even more and they're announcing today that europe
[42:18.800 --> 42:24.720]  and obama want to bring in even more so they're trying to break our will and do illogical things
[42:24.720 --> 42:31.520]  in our faces i don't see it as going too well for them but i'm sure now they're going to launch
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.880]  more and more devastating attacks uh it's going to escalate i think england's going to be hit europe's
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.160]  going to be hit a bunch and i think you're going to see hits here in america and notice it's the
[42:42.160 --> 42:49.040]  liberal leftist areas that coddle and grovel like la and brussels belgium and paris france and cologne
[42:49.040 --> 42:56.880]  germany where they literally hate themselves and worship anything anti-democratic so it will be the
[42:56.880 --> 43:03.040]  liberals that that that that worship this because they hate the west so much that are going to be
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.480]  the ones that'll be attacked you watch these jihadists know not to attack veterans patriots or
[43:08.480 --> 43:16.160]  armed groups they attack the people they disdain the most because they hate liberals the problem is
[43:16.160 --> 43:23.520]  liberals hate their countries and christ and the family and men and women and children more these are
[43:23.520 --> 43:29.680]  cuckold people that are basically mentally ill paul joseph watch then we're going to have you guys
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.480]  a little bit in the next hour joe bigs is about to pop in as well you've heard my breakdown of this
[43:34.480 --> 43:40.160]  unprecedented the media is now saying basically it's donald frum's fault there's uh soros is
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.920]  back out saying he's he's he's stirring up ices not the people that brought him in this is unprecedented
[43:47.760 --> 43:53.600]  well salon.com came out with a headline about half an hour ago it says the brussels attacks are
[43:53.600 --> 43:59.200]  a sobering reminder just how dangerous the gop presidency would be with a huge picture of donald
[43:59.200 --> 44:04.560]  trump you know because europe is really peaceful right now isn't it with a democratic president
[44:04.560 --> 44:10.560]  in office so again immediately we're seeing this narrative you know not all muslims in fact twitter
[44:11.280 --> 44:17.200]  the hashtag stop islam was trending it's now being taken down in the usa trends it's still
[44:17.200 --> 44:23.920]  trending in the uk suggesting that they killed it so there's a deliberate effort now to downplay this
[44:23.920 --> 44:29.840]  because this attack in brussels belgium we know from where it emerged which was mollambique of
[44:29.840 --> 44:38.640]  course four days ago we had the arrest of the paris massacre culprits ala abdeslam and he was
[44:38.640 --> 44:44.800]  protected by people in mollambique this is why i say over and over again that it's not just jihadists
[44:44.800 --> 44:51.440]  it's not just radical terrorists there's a violence problem with islam because many of these people
[44:51.440 --> 44:56.560]  support these that's right the communities are protecting them you are run out of these joe big
[44:56.560 --> 45:02.400]  said in iraq and afghanistan it was nothing like the general hate of every man woman and child
[45:02.400 --> 45:08.960]  screaming get out european you were there i mean describe it paul yeah we were there we were refused
[45:08.960 --> 45:14.320]  service for being white we were basically intimidated and chased out of the area the
[45:14.320 --> 45:20.240]  day after they raided the paris mastermind there were no police there whatsoever but again muslim
[45:20.240 --> 45:25.440]  no go areas are a conspiracy theory the media told me so so then we had this article out of
[45:25.440 --> 45:30.960]  Reuters on sunday paris fugitive helped more by friends and neighbors than islamic state
[45:31.520 --> 45:38.160]  they helped hide him in this jihadist hellhole mollambique for four months he would have been
[45:38.160 --> 45:41.440]  gone he would have been walking around people would have seen him people would have known he
[45:41.440 --> 45:48.560]  was there not a single person in that area reported it to police because again there's a violence
[45:48.560 --> 45:55.040]  problem with islam it's not just a tiny fringe minority there are islamists who want to impose
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.720]  this on the world they defend they provide protection for actual terrorists like the
[46:00.720 --> 46:07.200]  paris massacre culprit and now they're saying that this attack in brussels was probably advanced it
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.760]  was brought forward because they had this guy they could have interrogated him he might have
[46:11.760 --> 46:18.480]  uh let's flip some of the details so again there's this direct correlation back to mollambique
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.840]  which is just a short walk from the center of brussels we walked into it we got kicked out
[46:23.840 --> 46:28.800]  and let me go over the false flag issue is this not a false flag by the socialists of europe
[46:28.800 --> 46:33.360]  to destabilize things to bring in a civil emergency i said it was day one it's now happened
[46:33.360 --> 46:38.240]  halan's up there like he's a hero merkel says she's a hero they're the ones that brought these
[46:38.240 --> 46:45.760]  pieces of trash in well now because it's completely discredited their narrative multiculturalism
[46:45.760 --> 46:51.200]  doesn't work that's been proven over and over again every time there's one of these attacks
[46:51.200 --> 46:57.040]  it discredits that collectivist idea that you can import millions and millions of people
[46:57.040 --> 47:02.960]  have no plan whatsoever to assimilate them and not have problems the narrative has been completely
[47:02.960 --> 47:08.880]  discredited it's now to the point where you know you've got green party politicians up there saying
[47:08.880 --> 47:12.880]  germans are going to be a minority major cities within 20 years that's a good thing
[47:12.880 --> 47:18.160]  so the only thing i can think is that they're trying to just extract native populations out of
[47:18.160 --> 47:23.680]  these major cities all together so they can have a dominant muslim voting bloc who will now be the
[47:23.680 --> 47:28.400]  police and the bureaucrats and the bullies i just can't believe europeans let their police and
[47:28.400 --> 47:34.480]  military be ordered to let these people in a and then b have isis admitting they're doing it
[47:34.480 --> 47:39.280]  and then let them kill people because i mean i saw the bbc footage i've seen the russia today
[47:39.280 --> 47:46.000]  footage where the reporters are being beaten up in sweden and in um brussels belgium and the police
[47:46.000 --> 47:53.120]  do nothing and stand there no there was there was a clip out of sweden just uh yesterday the police
[47:53.120 --> 47:59.040]  refused to go in with this film crew even after they'd been attacked within 90 seconds of arriving
[47:59.040 --> 48:05.600]  in this muslim ghetto area the cameraman got run over they called the police the police said no sorry
[48:05.600 --> 48:11.280]  we can't go in there because it will cause more problems but again no go areas those guys are
[48:11.280 --> 48:15.440]  so easy to bash their brains out it looks like it'd be so easy to stomp their guts in i'm about
[48:15.440 --> 48:18.400]  to throw up stay there i'm gonna skip this network break because this is an emergency
[48:18.400 --> 48:23.920]  transmission today uh joe biggs stay there paul joe biggs what is it like for you because again
[48:23.920 --> 48:27.680]  you were in heavy combat it was written about magazines you had big reporters embedded with
[48:27.680 --> 48:32.640]  your combat unit i mean and then you told me on the phone you're like listen this is more dangerous
[48:32.640 --> 48:37.440]  on average than being in country a lot of those folks didn't like radical jihadists they must have
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.800]  only brought radical jihadists in here and that's what the media now admits europe is like picking
[48:42.800 --> 48:48.480]  only the very worst to bring into europe what do you think's going on here joe well first off i'd
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.520]  like to go in what happened today i believe that today was a diversion um after the capture of abdul
[48:53.520 --> 48:58.880]  salam uh the other sleeper cells in that molambique area knew that they needed to do something to
[48:58.880 --> 49:05.200]  create a diversion so they can move those cells out of that area and take their network somewhere
[49:05.200 --> 49:11.920]  else where they could essentially rebuild and gain strength to conduct more attacks now the attack
[49:11.920 --> 49:16.640]  was also probably done in part you know by the fact that they had captured adul salam as well
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.040]  but the fact that he was captured in that area that we were walking around you know zimmerman
[49:21.040 --> 49:25.840]  Watson myself without any police escort without any help shows you that there was some kind of
[49:25.840 --> 49:30.960]  break in that community somebody said something and those guys needed to create a diversion to get
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.680]  out of there and i believe there will be more attacks i believe london will be probably one of
[49:35.680 --> 49:39.600]  the next ones but i don't think it's over in that area yet i think there's going to be a lot more
[49:39.600 --> 49:47.120]  going on getting back though to you saying look the the saturation of anti westerners here is the
[49:47.120 --> 49:50.960]  highest i've ever seen on the phone and i'm like really joe and you're like yes these people are
[49:50.960 --> 49:56.080]  trying to ram us with cars interfaces throwing us out everywhere he goes for miles and miles you
[49:56.080 --> 50:00.720]  just and you were you were really shocked you said it's worse than we even were told and then
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.680]  they say donald trump's a conspiracy theorist for saying there's no go zones in london no go zones in
[50:05.680 --> 50:11.520]  russles no go zones in paris and i was completely mind blown at the fact that people were writing
[50:11.520 --> 50:16.000]  these uh you know comments on these youtube videos where you know we had done the the radio show that
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.360]  night with you and we're saying that we had been chased out of there and they're like oh these things
[50:19.360 --> 50:24.640]  don't exist there's no such a such thing as a no goes on you guys are making this whole story up well
[50:24.640 --> 50:28.800]  what do you have to say about it now that does exist the fact that the three of us were out there
[50:28.800 --> 50:34.800]  with no no weapons whatsoever no escort shows you the amount of danger that we were in and the people
[50:34.800 --> 50:39.040]  that live in that area and by the way they shoot people all the time and the media hardly reports it
[50:39.040 --> 50:44.720]  in sweden they order them not to report shootings and rapes if it's done by jihadi any any any one of
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.680]  us could have been in another cia room a green screen room getting our heads chopped off you know
[50:49.680 --> 50:55.360]  the fact that these people were screaming chasing us in cars uh we tried to seek refuge inside of a
[50:55.360 --> 51:00.240]  what seemed to be like a restaurant or something this guy jumps in front of watch and grabs a door
[51:00.240 --> 51:04.960]  and uh it was basically you know get the hell out of here you know that is a very volatile spot and
[51:04.960 --> 51:10.480]  these people it's not a religion of peace and like he like Watson said it's not a small number of
[51:10.480 --> 51:15.360]  these people it's a very large amount of people and there's nothing wrong with donald trump going
[51:15.360 --> 51:20.320]  hey let's shut this down for a second let's figure out a better way to vet this so we don't have more
[51:20.320 --> 51:28.080]  of these attacks incredible well we got tim kennedy coming in today and and and that should be very
[51:28.080 --> 51:32.800]  very informative because obviously he's taking on a lot of the top terrorist targets that's
[51:32.800 --> 51:40.640]  classified but the point is i separately have gone and researched it but uh it's just so clear
[51:40.640 --> 51:44.720]  that the elite have brought these people in they have they've done it they're letting them attack us
[51:44.720 --> 51:48.480]  they're bringing it even more and then they're going to take our freedoms when they attack
[51:49.440 --> 51:54.240]  this is a false flag i mean is there any doubt in your mind that that the establishment knows full
[51:54.240 --> 51:58.400]  well what they're doing joe and where do you think they're going to this and then paul Watson of course
[51:58.400 --> 52:02.160]  i know what they're doing i mean we already saw what happened in the in the paris attacks
[52:02.160 --> 52:07.120]  you know uh this is stuff it's going to continue to happen if we don't do something and the fact
[52:07.120 --> 52:11.920]  that we don't have one presidential candidate other than trump there really has a plan to stop
[52:11.920 --> 52:16.560]  something like this and take a step back and look at it to reassess the situation and actually do
[52:16.560 --> 52:21.040]  something positive for the american people you know we already have people like merkel and all
[52:21.040 --> 52:26.400]  these other folks like holland that are completely ignoring the fact that these people are coming
[52:26.400 --> 52:30.080]  into their countries and killing them instead they'd rather kiss their butts and go okay let's
[52:30.080 --> 52:33.760]  bring them in let's bring in more let's bring in more and then notice again it's that overturning
[52:33.760 --> 52:40.080]  of reality where soros megan kelly all these people come out and say trump is stirring up ices
[52:40.080 --> 52:45.120]  it's trump's fault when they attack and then when the sleeper cells activate they're going to go on
[52:45.120 --> 52:50.880]  the news like the washington post and say arrest trump i mean folks think of and then police officers
[52:50.880 --> 52:55.360]  go off duty you black police officers you name it and say the trump people do nothing and the
[52:55.360 --> 53:00.080]  anti-trump people run around hitting spitting and attacking and the media says it's their fault
[53:00.080 --> 53:04.320]  folks this is soros and the globalist allied with the jihadist communist and every other
[53:04.320 --> 53:10.720]  form of filth attacking us here's donald trump in january warning of exactly what was really
[53:10.720 --> 53:16.640]  happening here it is we do admit 100 000 muslims on a permanent basis here every year and this
[53:16.640 --> 53:21.280]  is going to be the large or is already the largest religion in the world can you really say let's do
[53:21.280 --> 53:29.200]  a temporary halt there's something going on maria go to brussels go to paris go to different places
[53:29.200 --> 53:34.240]  there's something going on and it's not good where they want your real law where they want this
[53:34.240 --> 53:39.280]  where they want things that you know there has to be some assimilation there is no assimilation
[53:39.280 --> 53:44.560]  there's something bad going on and until we find out what it is so we can correct it you go to
[53:44.560 --> 53:50.480]  brussels i was in brussels a long time ago 20 years ago so beautiful everything's so beautiful it's
[53:50.480 --> 53:55.440]  like living in a hellhole right now you go to these different places there's something going on
[53:56.800 --> 54:00.880]  see trump is really informed and they can't stand it and a trump is used to come out he
[54:00.880 --> 54:05.840]  almost did a daypack and said look nato's with ices and then and then the cruise goes that's
[54:05.840 --> 54:10.720]  dumb they're fighting ices no they helped put ices in and al qaeda so trump knows everything folks
[54:10.720 --> 54:14.400]  he's ready to destroy him he's ready to bring out how criminals in our government the clintons
[54:14.400 --> 54:20.320]  and the bushes work with the soddies on 9 11 the military's awake uh the military as you know joe
[54:20.320 --> 54:25.200]  four years ago said no to launching attacks to back ices and al qaeda to their credit that's
[54:25.200 --> 54:28.960]  got to really scare the globalist job yeah exactly i mean i spoke with a british couple
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.760]  over south by southwest here at the event in austin and uh the wife was actually telling me how her
[54:33.760 --> 54:38.880]  her husband went to the ua e and when she went there she she thought about the culture she goes
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.080]  you know what i'm not going to wear a skirt i'm going to wear jeans i'm going to be respectful
[54:42.080 --> 54:47.360]  of how they are so she was walking around to the ua e had no uh you know cleavage types anything
[54:47.360 --> 54:51.600]  showing no legs nothing like that it was very respectful of the culture and she says now when
[54:51.600 --> 54:55.600]  she goes back home to london where she lives in certain areas but she dresses the way that's part
[54:55.600 --> 55:01.680]  of their culture she gets looked at called a whore spit at and and completely demonized because
[55:01.680 --> 55:06.800]  these people like you said are not assimilating what's amazing is they mix with this weird leftist
[55:06.800 --> 55:11.200]  hatred they say they're so entitled from what i've been told they're worse than in their own
[55:11.200 --> 55:17.280]  countries now here in the west with the left backing them and loving it what sick bizarre
[55:17.280 --> 55:23.680]  filth paul these aren't leftists what do you call these bizarro folks well they act like fascists so
[55:23.680 --> 55:29.200]  why not call them fascists and i mean isis in its own manifesto said you know radical islamists share
[55:29.200 --> 55:35.200]  a lot of the same beliefs as the modern progressive left so we should start recruiting them radicalizing
[55:35.200 --> 55:40.880]  them and arming them he said that in their own documents so that's a major correlation the other
[55:40.880 --> 55:46.640]  point is you've got a lot of people on the left again saying blaming foreign policy for terrorist
[55:46.640 --> 55:52.400]  acts like this well you can argue that arming jihadists in libya and syria by nato was a disastrous
[55:52.400 --> 55:58.240]  policy it was but then you look at belgium specifically okay they were against the iraq war
[55:58.240 --> 56:05.520]  from the very start they suspended their bombing campaign against isis in syria eight months ago
[56:05.520 --> 56:11.280]  and they still got attacked by terrorists so you can't use that excuse over and over again
[56:11.280 --> 56:17.440]  blaming it on foreign policy to absolve islam of blame well again let's expand france backed al-qaeda
[56:17.440 --> 56:22.720]  and isis the number one group it's on record the takeover syria and so isis is attacking
[56:22.720 --> 56:29.280]  france to give haland cover to take french freedom look haland is working for isis i'm not just saying
[56:29.280 --> 56:34.960]  that folks it's a hundred percent proof we have them they let them bring them in they have suspended
[56:34.960 --> 56:40.320]  the liberties paul is there any doubt that halan and merkel are actually i guarantee you
[56:40.320 --> 56:46.800]  they're meeting with isis leadership well that they they would rather their own citizens be killed
[56:46.800 --> 56:52.000]  than admit that multiculturalism is a completely failed and disastrous policy that's what it comes
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.840]  down to yes but they've been they've been quarterbacking funding isis and al-qaeda in syria
[56:57.840 --> 57:03.280]  they worked with turkey to bring them in it's worse than that paul oh no it's a complete
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.800]  disaster on all sides no they hate europe they want to destroy it exactly i mean even even
[57:08.800 --> 57:13.040]  leave singer jesse hughes from eagles of death metal the band that was playing at the botaclon
[57:13.040 --> 57:17.440]  theater when that horrendous attack happened said that he thought that this was an inside job the
[57:17.440 --> 57:21.840]  fact that he said that there was supposed to be a large amount of security that never even showed
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.240]  up and only one did and he was in the backstage area and he said he kept getting a bad feeling
[57:26.240 --> 57:31.120]  and he kept asking these guys who is this guy it doesn't feel right i don't want to go on with this
[57:31.120 --> 57:34.960]  and then that entire thing unfolded so there's definitely something going on by the way i want
[57:34.960 --> 57:39.040]  that lead singer of eagles of death on immediately i already contacted him he's out of town i spoke
[57:39.040 --> 57:44.160]  with his uh one of his managers out in l.a. the other day well good job i know i'm ranting here
[57:44.160 --> 57:48.640]  paul watson come back you were trying to say something i'm just so angry i'm so angry at these
[57:48.640 --> 57:55.840]  pigs like halan and merkel and then obama all anti west anti freedom trash bringing in the most
[57:55.840 --> 58:02.400]  abusive anti-liberty scum anti-female scum i have daughters and i'm sick of the left saying
[58:02.400 --> 58:07.760]  they have the moral high ground over women you people hate women you goddamn pieces of crap
[58:07.760 --> 58:12.000]  excuse me i'm gonna stop it's a family show i apologize but i have had enough of these people

[58:24.480 --> 58:29.360]  not religion of peace but i apologize just to come back i did not mean to do that on purpose

[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:14.720]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network china is the billion and a half political
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:20.720]  slaves that are leveraging out all other economies and industries in the world but the globalist
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.840]  allied with them the globalists are also allied with the mind control cult that is radical
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.120]  wahhabist islam that's taking over islam and they're the muscle to physically stir up trouble
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:36.000]  worldwide to take western liberties as the answer to countering that and our elites think we're so
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.160]  unlogical and so stupid they're going to bring millions of them in protect them and let them
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.880]  attack i want to tell soros obama hillary the globalist all of you we know you're behind it
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:51.920]  we know you turn these people loose on syria on egypt and our allies that are pro-western
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:58.560]  and our good muslims you are the filth of the earth and we see you and we know who you are
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.680]  joe bigs we have to get this message out because of the elite don't know the people don't know the
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:09.120]  full story they're going to keep doing this this is so naked it's so obvious joe i mean i'm kind of
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.640]  fearful for the fact that we have this uh you know looming racial war you know about to happen and
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:20.160]  then you have possibly sleeper cells moving in the background unseen right now because so many
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:25.040]  people are focused oh there's no possible they've got tons of these on these trump rallies you know
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.280]  um my my fear is that they're going to take one of these rallies and then something's going to
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280]  happen at one of them and they're still going to blame him and blame the deaths on him and then
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.640]  that's what they're going to use to try to take him out it's definitely a possibility and the
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.840]  trendings are so stupid they'll actually blame trump if jihadists attack even though we've got
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.360]  the scores i mean they'll probably sit there and shake their hand if any of the uh the jihadi
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.600]  survive their uh their bombing they'll come over and shake their hand and tell them thank you and
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:51.920]  they want more in fact paul we've seen the twitter comments from the left saying i hope jihadis kill
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.960]  trump these little babies wouldn't last 10 minutes in saudi arabia try dressing up like a woman over
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:04.560]  there and see what happens you idiots paul and eight trump tweets are just hundreds and hundreds
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.720]  a day i mean i've stopped looking anymore it's ridiculous but here was a tweet from somebody
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.120]  in the immediate aftermath of this attack the attacks in brussels are why donald trump shouldn't
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.800]  be president his violent rhetoric would only induce attacks like this okay this is a guy who
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.880]  was against the iraq war from the star hillary clinton voted for that war which killed nearly
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:31.760]  a million muslims hillary clinton was behind the libya and syria debaul allied with al-qaeda
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.840]  allied with al-qaeda allied with al-qaeda his terror threat and he was allied with al-qaeda
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:41.760]  there then sure you go ahead yeah but it's all donald trump's fault because he was against a war
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:46.560]  that killed nearly a million muslims that doesn't make much sense does it then you've got another one
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:52.160]  here if you've already blamed what's happened in brussels on islamic immigrants then you're a racist
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:59.680]  you are a racist well islam is not a race to begin with okay so you've got that sentiment over and
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:05.760]  over again you've got leftists saying don't politicize this tragedy while they politicize
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:11.840]  it to blame the people who they're ideologically aligned against so you've got the typical stock
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.280]  response from the left and again it's the ostrich brigade they will stick their head in the sand
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:23.200]  and bleed all day islam is religion of peace islam is a religion of peace they then face the
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:29.600]  reality and only by facing the reality are we going to reduce this kind of terrorism i agree i
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.360]  want to get you guys i think you're busy writing articles and getting ready but tucker carlson's
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.760]  coming on i want to get you both to uh pop in like 40 after or so just for 10 minutes with him
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:46.240]  and make some points because this is really powerful radio and tv i personally am seriously
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.440]  angry because i can see the plan now it's so dastardly it's meant to kill our freedoms
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.000]  it makes me sick and paul just a quick comment and then and then joe do you not concur with me
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  or do you disagree or do you feel in your gut as i've been saying it's a buildup that this is the
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.400]  beginning of something really bad i know they have sleeper cells everywhere it's admitted and
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.240]  they're getting ready to go absolutely ape and then somehow we're going to be blamed for it i mean
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.720]  this is incredible well if you look at what the top security experts in belgium are saying today
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.160]  they're completely overwhelmed they've got every single police detective every single
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:26.400]  intelligence expert in belgium chasing these jihadis around everywhere they can't cope they're
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.520]  completely overwhelmed so if they if they have enough you know if they have enough organization
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.920]  to do this really on a larger scale then yes it's going to happen because there's simply not enough
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:42.240]  resources to track it all and as i said in places like mollambique they've got so much support just
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.760]  from all the other islamists but that only and well that's the issue they brought in alien outside
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.960]  radical jihad transplants and these people are being celebrated as heroes and the attacks will
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:58.480]  just get worse and worse thank you paul powerful thank you biggs we'll be back with tucker carlsson

[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.440]  ladies and gentlemen we have tucker carlson on the man that heads up the daily caller dot com
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.400]  one of the top news sites in the world not just alternative news but leading the news of course
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.960]  featured quite a bit on drudge report dot com info wars dot com you name it and i wanted to get him
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:36.240]  on about election 2016 he's had great coverage on fox weekdays and on the weekends with the show he
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:43.440]  host uh but now we have these big attacks and look i want to be clear what i've said over the years
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:47.520]  has been misrepresented by the mainstream media and so i don't blame people like carlson when he
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.240]  would just hear just salts of it saying you know that guy's a cook because the media would say that
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.640]  i said this is what hardball host said chris mathews that bush had a plunger like wiley coyote and
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.600]  blew up the world trade center towers what i said is from when i saw in the news at the time and our
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.720]  sources in congress was that radicals in saudi arabia and their government some of their royal
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.160]  family were funding the hijackers the fbi was ordered to stand down that was in the news and
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:18.000]  that there was and that in the congressional report that came out a few years after 9 11
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:23.360]  that there was basically a stand down ordered at norad and that they flew the bin ladens out of
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:30.880]  the country and that was in the miami herald so i said inside job falls flag because criminal elements
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:38.960]  in both parties stood to gain and they allowed those tax to take place i i believe there's radical
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:46.160]  islam i'm totally against it i'm a classical liberal i can't stand the way saudi arabia beheads
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:52.000]  gay people i can't stand the way the jihadists throw uh you know catholic priest off of clips
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.960]  and and and homosexuals and then i see the left allied with them so when i say what happened in
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:05.040]  brussels belgium that's killed 34 people and hundreds injured more they think are gonna die
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:11.360]  in huge bombings that happened earlier this morning i'm saying it's a false flag in that
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.800]  haland and merkel and all the rest of them brought millions of people in from war torn
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.640]  zones that they knew were connected to saudi arabia and qatar and jihadis and who said they
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:28.640]  were gonna attack and they've got stinger missiles that came out from in gazi why would our governments
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.160]  bring these people in to declare civil emergencies take people's rights in france and germany arrest
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.360]  nationalist leaders like marie lapin that's not even as hardcore as donald trump the left wants to
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.640]  arrest trump the washington post last week and said could he be fined or indicted or sued because
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:53.120]  he is causing the violence no he's not so that's where i'm coming from here is are they that dumb
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.000]  to bring jihadis in and know they're not gonna attack or are they using it to take liberties
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.720]  regardless they are aiding and abetting it they are involved in it so it's a false flank it's a real
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:11.520]  jihadi attack but if i'm involved and let you in knowing what you're gonna do then i am partially
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:17.920]  to blame and so that's where i really stand when i say false flank because nato and our own government
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:22.800]  has been helping fund al-qaeda grips in syria and now they're coming through turkey this isn't
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:28.800]  blowback they knew this would happen that's what the pentagon four years ago went on tv all these
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.600]  top added colonel schaefer on you name it that's why general dempsi then chairman of the joint
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.640]  chiefs went to obama the night before the air raid started on Assad and said we're not going to be
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:44.240]  the air force of al-qaeda so they changed the name to isis no one's defending Assad but he is a good
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.400]  guy compared to isis and al-qaeda the russians have come in kicked al-qaeda and isis but now all
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.840]  these refugees that came into invade almost all of them are going into europe why is the left
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.640]  inviting them in why is the left saying we want you here why are they telling german women don't
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.680]  wear short skirts don't go out at night why are they beating up bbc crews and 60 minute crews
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:13.200]  all over europe at bus stations they've now mutated hardcore leftist garbage with hardcore radical
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.960]  islam and it's bizarre it's crazy and it really makes me ask what is the left doing because i've
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:23.440]  never been what you call a right winger i'm a libertarian but i gotta tell you the left
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:29.840]  is the most sickening political amalgamation i've ever seen they have rotted now i'm ranting
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.320]  tucker carlson is joining us for the next 47 minutes i really appreciate tucker coming on
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.080]  daily caller dot com tucker that's my rant now you know face to face where i stand when i say
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.720]  false flag do you agree with that disagree with that and where do you see this going how was the
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:51.600]  left from obama to merkel to haland going to deal with these sleeper cells clearly ramping up how are
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.080]  they going to blame donald trump because they're in the news trump already blaming muslims immigration
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:02.160]  for terror attacks i've seen dozens of articles today in mainstream news blaming him somehow
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:08.640]  will the public really buy this tucker carlson well you know i i guess i i don't fully understand
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.800]  what the term false flag means so i can't endorse uh that idea i do think that you're right that the
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:20.080]  left has made this possible i don't think they've invited terror attacks on purpose i think the
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.040]  i think the explanation is more prosaic more obvious this is a result of the guilt of the
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.400]  successful this is when you know western nations have begun to feel that they're not justified
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:35.360]  in being as successful as they are in the case of germany angela merkel in effect runs europe
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:41.520]  and she has a special burden of german war guilt which makes it impossible for her and many germans
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:46.880]  frankly in elite positions to look at the rest of the world clearly they always feel that they're
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.080]  in a morally inferior inferior position and so it's impossible for them to say this is an
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.600]  inferior culture these people believe things that are a threat to liberal western values
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.720]  they're a threat to us they can't make normal comments you're saying it's total self loathing
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:08.240]  shelf hating of course it is you know because you know these people and i i live next to them
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:13.440]  by the way i don't think any of them welcome terror attacks i don't think any of them are
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.960]  evil on purpose i don't even think the president is evil on purpose i but i really think they're
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:26.720]  starting from a a place where they are incapable or unwilling to consider the cultures that give rise
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.440]  to radical jihad inferior to our own and you saw that in the president's remarks from cuba this
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:39.520]  morning the first thing he said was you're also at fault america basically this is a problem that
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:45.600]  comes from racism we can't you know be biased against one another on the basis of race or national
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:52.400]  origin or religion basically using a denunciation of terror attacks to scold america for its intolerance
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:59.040]  this is the reason that this whole order world order post war second world war order that we
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.800]  have now is going to crumble because it's not adequate it's not strong enough to fight the
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.520]  forces that are now attacking us because they don't believe that they're right in order to
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:13.920]  run a country or defend a civilization you have to kind of believe that you're better than the people
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.760]  you're fighting and they just don't believe that so it comes down to the fact that they hate the west
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.320]  they have self loathing right and they want to be the managers over this whole multicultural
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.880]  nightmare i mean i i see that for a lot of them i think you're right tucker for maybe 60 but there's
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.680]  a sicker part of the social engineering that they know if they bring in incompatible groups
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:35.840]  there's going to be a lot of friction and then the state can come in with political correctness
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:41.920]  and more speech control and make us comply with radical islam look at europe banning right wing
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.280]  and nationalist groups protesting and and and you know taking their rights away well of course i mean
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.080]  because that's always the response someone horrible whether it's domestic international
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.440]  does something unacceptable and you need to give up your rights as a response to that rather than
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.760]  you know punishing the person responsible you middle america need to stop doing this that the
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.480]  other thing it's your fault of course i agree with that and also in this country there's a
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.000]  direct political implication which is more immigration means more democratic voters so that's
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.720]  that's always kind of present in the calculation for democratic politicians you can't prevent anyone
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.040]  for moving here because they're going to vote for you sure what about the left love affair because
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:27.520]  the left doesn't know at the universities loves radical islamics more than anybody i've ever seen
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.440]  even though radical islamics would kill gays lesbians liberals in a minute in their home country
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:37.360]  and and the main groups they seem to want to bring in are radical jihadis that are invading
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.640]  more moderate muslim countries well that's the hilarious part is that you hear trump
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.480]  denounced every day i'm not flacking for trump i just marvel at this as a sexist okay because he's
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:53.440]  i don't know he's intolerant well really if you think about it trump is criticizing cultures
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.120]  that literally don't allow women to drive or to appear in public or to have physical contact
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:04.480]  with men not their wives or poor acid on their faces if they talk back right i'm starting to laugh
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.320]  but it's just so insane if you're a sincere feminist and you're worried about preserving
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.280]  the rights of women and by the way is the father of three daughters i'm sympathetic to that
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.680]  then aren't you most angry at the culture and it's like a third of the world that doesn't allow
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:23.280]  women basic human and civil rights no you're not i have daughters i have daughters i am i am at a
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.800]  fundamental level disgusted by that and the left tells me that i don't care about women
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.400]  as if they have some moral superiority they just make up i mean is that does that annoy you as a
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.440]  father as well well what what really surprises me is the frequency with which you hear the term
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:43.920]  sexist and the rarity with which you hear it defined so like you're a sexist which in other
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.920]  words means just shut up you're not allowed in this conversation your point if you doesn't matter
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.160]  but nobody ever defines what it is to be a sex what does that exactly mean or what does it mean
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.560]  to be a racist as long as these terms are going to be career ending as long as you're going to be
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.520]  the most powerful terms we have to deploy in public conversation shouldn't we define them with some
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.160]  precision so we know what they mean and yet the people throwing them out have no incentive to
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.200]  define them because that would that would of course reduce their power so it's you literally
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.200]  hear feminists on the one hand say donald trump or whoever i don't agree with politically or
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:21.360]  who's against abortion is a sexist and yet they simultaneously make excuses for cultures that
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:26.720]  literally believe women aren't entirely human so maybe it's time to start defining things a
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.360]  little bit more but i played a clip three times the last week of the chicago you know basically
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:35.600]  riots against trump where guys interviewing some ladies that have mexican flags he's being polite
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.680]  to them but but you know she you know they're basically saying racist stuff and then the white
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.680]  woman comes over and says these are women of color you're a white male you don't have a
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:47.600]  right to speak to them because of your male privilege i know and she's totally disconnected
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:53.840]  from reality what why are the universities teaching this i mean i don't know where this is coming from
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.200]  well i mean they're teaching it because they're not challenged on it i mean look it would be good
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.040]  to get back to first principles okay and to hold people accountable to those principles and one
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:08.640]  of them is you're not allowed to attack people on the basis of qualities they can't control okay
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.960]  that would be their gender their skin color their ethnicity these are not things anyone's
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.640]  responsible for their things you're born with and therefore we don't hold people responsible for them
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.000]  well i don't hold you responsible for what your parents did i don't hold you responsible for how
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.320]  tall you are i hold you responsible for decisions that you make and this used to be something that
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:29.760]  all good people all liberals in the best sense agreed on and yet somehow we've gotten to a place
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:35.680]  where it's okay to attack people based on these immutable characteristics it seems to me if you're
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.800]  going to fix america and by fix i mean help us get along better and stop hating each other so much
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.360]  have a more prosperous safer more stable society i think that's we can all agree that's a good goal
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.760]  then really one of the very first things you need to say is this is unacceptable you're really not
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.800]  allowed to do that and yet the left does it with impunity they do it with high levels of aggression
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.680]  the president himself does it all the time writing people off because of the way they look or their
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.960]  race what's the end game here what do you think this winds up if you tell people that they are
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:11.680]  hated by others in their society for reasons that they can't control boy you wind up creating conflict
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:16.800]  that does not go away that's not resolved and that winds up in a very ugly place down the line
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:20.560]  and i think they're doing it i don't know if they're doing it on purpose but they're certainly doing it
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.440]  what about hillary clinton uh you know saying it's up on daily color dot com right now
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.320]  saying that hey yeah we'll give you legal health care we already get to come have their babies here
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:35.440]  i'm not against people from china or mexico or eastern europe but i don't get to go have a baby
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:41.280]  for free and man i pay a lot of taxes and there's this attitude that well you're rich you're an
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:46.960]  american you should have to pay this stuff really i saw the irs try to take my grandfather's house
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.360]  after he and my grandmother were both sick and it was a modest house and and then they had to
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.880]  basically sell it to give the irs stuff they claim was back taxes that wasn't so i don't know where my
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:01.840]  white privilege is i've been arrested in new york for peacefully demonstrating against the iraq war
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:08.000]  just because i didn't have any white privilege then i watch footage a black lives matter and
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.280]  other groups attacking police in new york and the police do nothing so in my experience
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.720]  i don't know where this white privilege is i'm really missing out on it tucker well anyone who
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:23.280]  alleges the white privilege is by definition a racist i mean i think we can say that and we
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.040]  should say that i mean that's not that's not a legitimate form of conversation that's touring
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.040]  an entire group based on the way they look that's the definition of racism and i think people should
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.240]  just stand up and say that because it's true um as for hillary promising obama care to people here
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.160]  illegally on so many levels this is shocking and it should be on the front page of the new york times
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:45.120]  it's not today because they have donald trump to hate but this is one of the big lies of obama
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.120]  care and i'm sorry i don't want to sound like your garden variety right where but it's just true
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.400]  so when they rolled this out they claim what you could keep your coverage they claimed it would
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:57.600]  reduce costs and they said above all we're not going to give these benefits five thousand dollars per
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.640]  year per person to people here illegally they're not eligible and remember that and remember joe
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:07.120]  wilson during the president's day the union stood up and said you lied everyone said oh joe wilson
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.720]  you criticized the president you're obviously a racist you're from south carolina of course you're
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:16.720]  racist it turns out joe wilson was right they did lie now they've pulled off the mask and they're
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.360]  admitting that they want to give these federal best right it was a huge controversy there are no
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:26.240]  death panels there's no rationing of care you can keep your doctor uh we're not going to give
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:31.680]  illegals health care but there it was in the bill and they just counted the public i remember msnbc
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:38.400]  and cnn both said i was racist alex jones is racist deeply racist on msnbc he doesn't like
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.280]  obama care because obama's black no my dad was in the medical care industry managing hundreds of
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.720]  clinics he was getting ready to retire he'd read the bill he was a lobbyist at the state level
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:54.560]  and he was advising businesses to exit you know the country he retired i was an expert i knew it
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.960]  was a scam and they just called me a racist because i wore on the american people it was a screw job
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.800]  yeah i mean it's it's it's a shame that the president who was you know elected eight years ago
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:09.200]  on this idea he was going to unify the country that he was a physical atonement for america's
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.840]  past sins and he was we're going to move past all that and become a post-racial country which by
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:18.240]  the way i welcomed i didn't vote for the guy because i disagree with him but i that part of it i
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.280]  really liked i mean that was a that was a great promise i hope me too instead he has been the most
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.800]  racially explicitly and intentionally racially devised the president we've ever had by a factor of
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.160]  i don't know how much let me ask you a bunch of questions here we got five minutes to break and
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:36.480]  i want to come back and go through what you think's most important election 2016 tucker carlsson the
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.600]  daily caller dot com also fox news contributor he's one of the few people don't get him in trouble at
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:46.080]  fox that hasn't succumbed to trump bashing he and hannity i've really seen some behavior that
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:52.800]  that is just bizarro because it's not fair i mean i expect that from msnbc i expected uh from cnbc
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:58.240]  but it shows why the establishment is so scared but getting into trump uh and obviously the other
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:04.640]  channels are worse but man i tell you why do you think from george soros to the republican leadership
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:11.600]  uh to the chinese communist that there is such a conniption fit over trump and such a misrepresentation
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:18.000]  over the things he's saying and the total freak out because me personally i'm worried he used
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.920]  to like hillary clinton used to work with these people i'm worried this is rhetoric it's not
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:28.320]  strong enough and then i just but but then i ask why is the political establishment so scared
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:33.040]  when they know obama told people hey don't worry i'm fornaft in god i'm for globalism
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:39.360]  i'm just claiming i'm against it why are they scared of trump so much in your expert opinion
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.920]  tiger carlson well there are a couple reasons i mean what the obvious reasons are he says reckless
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.760]  things he doesn't know much about policy that is all true by the way that's completely true those
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.560]  are legitimate criticisms of trump there are also a lot of other things going on especially in
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.920]  washington trump came out and criticized the iraq war think about it virtually every republican
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:02.320]  in office or in some leadership position in the party at the rnc or the congressional committees
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.440]  is implicated in the bush administration in some way that was in effect a personal attack on them
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.240]  they resent it they hate it they take it personally trump doesn't want to attack countries that don't
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.760]  attack us he's a manly position by the way 95 percent of americans agree with that i mean this
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:24.080]  is the problem if and i'm not you know brooding about the iraq war every day but if you can't
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:29.120]  look back at the iraq war and say you know that was a mistake i'm we did it for the right motives
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:33.600]  but we blew it i'm sorry and we're not going to do it again trust us we're not going to do anything
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.360]  reckless like that again if the republican party had said that 10 years ago we wouldn't
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:43.040]  be having this conversation now but instead they enforced this ludicrous orthodoxy on their members
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.560]  where nobody could say out loud what was obviously true which was it didn't go for that's right the
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:52.000]  republican should be endorsing him like reagan and i view and thanking god he's atoning for stuff
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.320]  and and and was against at the time that would be great for the party well they think telling the
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.760]  truth in the end is always your best bet because a you don't have to remember what you said because
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.920]  you really believed it and second it kind of rings true with people and people appreciate that
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.240]  especially now in this moment where everyone is required to lie all the time nobody can say
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:14.080]  what he really thinks for fear of being punished i don't mean bigoted hateful things i mean like
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.320]  obvious normal common sense things when was the last time you didn't say something you thought
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.160]  for fear of being punished i mean in your case it probably doesn't apply but for the average person
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.240]  this is like a daily occurrence sure so just see someone like trump come up and just say you know i
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.400]  don't even care i'm so rich or crazy or whatever i'm just gonna say what i think sure that is
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.080]  thrilling even if you disagree with him and so that is a lot of it right there and then the third
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.920]  point which you obviously understand is he's a direct threat to their power and yeah the k street
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.080]  people are literally crapping their pants well the case three people are kind of accommodationist
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:47.360]  i mean they have a Mediterranean point of view that doesn't matter who's in power they'll they'll
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.320]  thrive but the party people the people who hold positions of authority within the republican
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.120]  party like it's it's over for them it is already over for them even if trump doesn't get the nomination
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:03.680]  they've been let me ask you this is it arrogance fear or stupidness that that top republicans come
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.840]  out and say we don't care if you get the nomination we're taking it we're changing the rules today
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:12.560]  we're gonna drop you we'd rather hillary i mean even if they're gonna cheat trump they
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.760]  shouldn't be saying it it's a bad move uh or do you disagree with me i mean it just seems like
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.240]  they're crazy they don't care by the way they have more in common with hillary a lot of them anyway
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.240]  on foreign policy and economic sure but why would they say it tucker that's what i'm asking that
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.800]  what look here's the point once they attacked him on identity politics grounds once they said not
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.960]  only are you wrong but you're immoral you're a racist and you're a sexist once they compared
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.360]  him to atall hitler which they have a lot they did today in a magazine i used to work for in
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.080]  washington compared him to hitler you can't walk back from that you can't once you believe someone
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.760]  is atall hitler they're totally committed they're totally committed they're totally like a month later
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:53.120]  you're not gonna say yeah he was hitler but now we kind of see eye to eye it's over you're never you
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.000]  can't ever support the guy and so they've gotten themselves into a position where as they put it
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.480]  on twitter never trump and it just becomes more extreme from there once you compare someone to
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:06.560]  hitler it's not even worth arguing with sure so so they made the mistake they think they have left
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:11.120]  cover because they're joining the the the liberal media they're bunch of old men mainly they're not
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:17.840]  computer savvy they think because msnbc and cnn suddenly like them everything must be okay they
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.040]  have no idea that that is discrediting them like nothing they could ever do these guys are basically
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:27.200]  self-immolating themselves in front of us in my view that is totally true and by the way if they
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:32.160]  disagree with his points on traitor immigration which is legitimate many people do explain why
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:36.400]  they're wrong tell me why we should have opened yeah don't use leftist ideology just calling him
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:41.280]  hitler and a racist it's not even ideology it's like the lowest tactic what they're basically
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.480]  saying is shut up they're not answering any of his his arguments to the extent he has arguments are
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:51.520]  not rebutting his positions they're just telling him to be quiet and go away that's you know mommy
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:58.000]  wants you to shut up so please do that's not an adult response like what is the argument for bringing
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.880]  syrian refugees to america they're so offended that's crazy what's the argument for it i haven't
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:07.920]  heard what the argument for it is i'm open convince me tell me why yeah tell me when most of them are
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.640]  invader jihadis that came to take over land tell them why i should bring the most hateful radical
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:17.840]  islamists to america please explain it to me look how good it's going for europe today yeah but they
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:23.440]  they don't bother so it's hey you're hitler shut up and really he has and i'm not again endorsing
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.800]  trump and i i have real concerns about trump because i don't think he learns sure but you're
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.840]  saying the attack's illegitimate her Carlson stay there you're gonna come back you'll have the floor
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.160]  let's go over it and i'm gonna play some clips of social justice warriors calling for the end of free
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:40.560]  speech uh and a lot more and trump warning that russells belgium is a hellhole my reporters were
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:45.360]  there when he said that they couldn't go through half the city without having radical muslims just

[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:24.960]  the
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:50.960]  the
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:57.520]  ladies and gentlemen i was just talking to tim kennedy famous green beret all sorts of secret
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.000]  of army grips he's part of we can't mention on air he'll be with us for a full hour coming up after
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.520]  tucker carlson leaves us grab joe bigs and paul watson popping in for questions from london and
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.080]  right here in texas for tucker carlson here about eight minutes uh but i tell you during a three
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:17.040]  minute break i was almost late getting back in here because there's a reason the establishment
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.880]  obviously doesn't want people like uh tim kennedy start getting on radio and tv and talking about
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.600]  politics because i'm back there during the break and just everything coming out of his mouth is
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.120]  just dead on with what's happening in this country in this world and that's why i continue to say
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.800]  our military especially special ops people but the military period are the most awake informed
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.920]  folks i mean they are the polar opposite of dumb down communist social justice warriors
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:50.240]  at the colleges who i'm sorry look like self-propelled stomachs hate freedom hate this country hate
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:56.160]  everybody including themselves love jihadist though and hate our military uh so it's amazing
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:01.280]  but tim you got a lot coming up today uh we're about to go back to tucker carlson but just briefly
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.920]  talking to you in there as you stand in front of the george washington banner uh overall whatever
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:11.760]  some of the things you're going to be covering uh in the third hour with us my friend there's a
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:18.720]  shift right now where we keep talking about um domestic terrorism guys in organ or like people
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.840]  at trump rallies where the emphasis and the entire focus needs to be on what's really going on right
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:32.240]  now um brussel's example san bernadino boston paris like this is not going to stop until we
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.040]  recognize and understand have a shift a paradigm shift of where we are focusing and what we're
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.840]  talking about political correctness has to go away we need to wake up as a nation because things are
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:47.440]  getting scary absolutely i tell you a few a few guys can sit there next to george washington
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.520]  and actually a complimenting how do you like standing next to old george there i'm humbled you
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:55.680]  know like that that's the man you know you're gonna talk about a guy that understood what terrorism is
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:02.160]  what tyranny is and uh and did something to change that that's this guy well i can't wait to have you
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:06.640]  in studio my friend and hopefully we can change down in here as well uh but thank you for joining
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:12.880]  us today it'll be fun all right that's tim kennedy coming up in the third hour today and then hosting
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:19.760]  the fourth hour today we're gonna have rob do going back to tucker carlson of the daily caller dot
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.920]  com uh that's a good point that mr kennedy just brought up i mean you see hillary homeland security
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:33.680]  obama big sis then holder now lynch saying no the number one threat is veterans gun owners
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:40.080]  patriots conservatives we need the irs to target christians msnbc doesn't even back away from that
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:46.080]  they're proud of it the persecution of people there's almost no right wing terrorism in this country
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:49.120]  but they don't want to worry about islamic terror they want to obsess on that what do you
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.960]  think's behind that well self-hatred of course and a loathing of america's middle class and it's not
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.280]  you know it's not just on the left by the way it's on full display right now on the right in
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:04.400]  washington new york and los angeles they just hate people who live between brentwood and georgetown
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.760]  i mean they're considered you know mouth breathers idiots proto plansmen they just don't like them and
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:18.880]  so that's why you see the president and hillary clinton and you know the head of the doj at every
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:25.600]  turn blame americans first this happened because you're intolerant your bigots you're contributing
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.440]  to global warming you drive a suburban and don't like black people that's why this happened i mean
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.680]  it's that's their first instinct every time and i'm just kind of surprised how nobody ever calls
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:39.360]  them on again the president in his remarks from havana this morning the first thing he said was
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.360]  you know racism this is what happens when you you know don't come together and that you don't
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.760]  like people on the basis of their skin color really that's the lesson that america's racist
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:55.120]  no that's not the lesson the lesson is we're being attacked it's not our fault and we should
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.160]  fight back but that's not the lesson he draws and by the way we have the clip it's up on info
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:06.160]  wars dot com where obama apologizes to rural castro a dictator that has hundreds of thousands
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:13.200]  in political prisons for americans just please advise us how to be better most of their houses
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:19.600]  are collapsing people live in government shelters the state raises the kids they can't make a automobile
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:25.920]  and we're going to be lectured by a caribbean dictatorship it is surreal for me to see this
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.720]  happen well it's it's totally surreal and i you know i i've been upset about the obama
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:36.640]  administration for a number of years but i was actually shocked by that when i saw obama apologize
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:43.520]  for you know the spanish-american war of 1898 we lived you know we kicked out the spanish but we
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.320]  did so because we wanted the influence over cuba we're apologizing for are you kidding
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:53.600]  to the castros who who led this crackdown of dissidents people just hoping to exercise you
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:58.160]  know the freedom to speak what they think before obama got there he doesn't even mention that i
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.600]  mean the whole thing is so demented it's so upside down and the coverage of it it's just appalling
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.360]  and i don't want to just be again another right winger complaining about the media coverage
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.760]  but i've been in it my whole life and i've never seen it like this i mean the washington post every
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.360]  day is just this roster of trump is hitler stories and there's no coverage sure you go under bush i got
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.920]  criticized as a super leftist because i didn't like a lot of things bush was doing patriot act wars
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:27.040]  but but i gotta say i mean even jonathan's early the big liberal constitutional lawyer says obama
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.280]  is three times worse than bush well that was five years ago how about ten times worse i mean
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:37.600]  i'm just calling like it is this is crazy and it's almost like a deviance like let's blame christians
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:43.200]  let's blame america oh let's listen to communist dictators to tell us how to run things mr dictator
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:49.520]  it is so comical if it wasn't so serious and it is deviant you're exactly right and i don't fully
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:54.480]  understand the psychology of it i grew up in a liberal neighborhood so i have a gut feeling for it
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:01.840]  but anything that is perverse or unattractive or unhealthy or mean or against sort of you know normal
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:07.200]  people is what they gravitate toward i don't understand it you see it with this transgender
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:11.360]  stuff and i i have mixed feelings with it because i have no ill will toward transgender people and
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.760]  i think you ought to be able to address however you want or whatever but the aggression with
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.400]  which they pushed it on everybody else and anybody who thinks it's you know sad that someone might
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:27.920]  want to change his gender since that's of course physically impossible we just lost tucker carlson
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:32.000]  skype tucker you were getting into gender impossible to change your skype broke up go ahead
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.320]  whatever i don't i'm not here to attack transgendered people i'm not either i'm wondering why it's the
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:44.560]  number one issue i just find it amazing that as the world collapses as the the world order
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:50.400]  established after world war two is literally crumbling exactly that the left spends so much time
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:55.520]  worrying about transgendered that's it i could care less about people do whatever i'm a libertarian
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:01.680]  but why is it all i turn on tv with my kids even on nicolodian it's about trainings i mean just when
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:08.480]  do we become planet training there goes the skype again i guess you say planet training the skype
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:12.560]  breaks up you're not allowed to say that uh tucker carlson is our guest joe biggs is in the other
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:18.800]  studio he has some breaking news on the situation uh while we get tucker carlson back on skype right
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:23.600]  now paul watson will pop back in from london england uh going to joe biggs while we get tucker back up
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.520]  joe breaking news on the situation tim kennedy makes a great point why are we obsessed about
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.640]  libertarian or right wing or patriot terror and it's almost non-existent but jihad terror we're
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:39.040]  told doesn't exist because it goes against the narrative that they're pushing they want us to
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:43.440]  be accepting they want to allow these people to come in so they can destroy our country that's why
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.800]  bernie sanders is so popular they want something like that you know it makes no sense why they would
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:55.200]  why this is such a popular thing right now to go after uh these patriot groups are literally
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:01.360]  standing up for good reason the fact that the blm is actually taking their land and mass numbers
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:09.520]  versus a group of people who are actually radical beheading people throwing homosexuals off bridges
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:15.280]  going and beheading people killing them murdering them raping them i i just don't understand why
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:22.320]  there's such uh this fascination with these domestic terrorists that i think is completely and totally
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.880]  out of this world i mean there's nothing really going on and then we're not to worry about these
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:32.240]  guys coming over here and killing us and mass numbers we saw what happened in san bernadito
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.720]  we saw that the fact that today brussels was already on high alert they already were worrying
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.800]  about something like this happened and like paul said earlier they are stretched so few for him
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:45.760]  beyond they don't even have the officers he actually protect those people right now and obviously it's
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.400]  an impossible job for the police and counterterrorism forces once you bring in like brussels has done the
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:56.800]  last two years half a million people from radical areas it's impossible once you open the gates
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.160]  and bring people in to protect everybody the border is where you do that cnbc is tweeting out right
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.000]  now the the obama administration is expected to announce new measures to tighten security at u.s
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.440]  airports following the brussel attacks and then you also have presidential candidate ted cruz coming
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:19.280]  out just not too long ago travis actually sent me a video where he comes out and says due to the
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.120]  nature of donald trump's uh words that he spoke what he said yesterday apac this is the reason why
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.600]  these attacks and brussels happen because he said that we shouldn't uh we shouldn't have as much uh
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.920]  time we shouldn't work with nato and they said because brussel is crazy he's pointing out nato
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.080]  help back isis in al-qaeda thank you joe for that pop it will come back to you in the next segment
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:44.400]  we do have tucker carlson back via skype uh tucker i've been ranting here and bringing up a lot of
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.200]  my points dailycaller.com of course you're one of the founders and owners of that major site
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.320]  that i started to be libertarian and populist not even so much establishment republican
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:57.360]  is the republican party i want you to get any subject you want to now but
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:03.120]  is the republican party in danger of destroying itself right as it becomes populist right as
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:08.320]  record numbers come into it uh even if trump has problems shouldn't they be cautiously supporting
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:13.440]  him trying to influence him in a good way they won't even meet with him the leadership uh and
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.840]  then they say we'd rather destroy the party and get hillary elected i mean that really proves
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:22.640]  it's a one-party system where do you see all that going and what other big issues are on your play
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.680]  well the party isn't being destroyed it's being reborn whether you agree with it or not but i mean
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:31.200]  political parties exist to serve their their voters i mean that's the only reason we have them
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.920]  and they they they change they ultimately they have to change to respond to the things that
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:42.080]  actual voters care about it america's economy it's demography everything about it has changed
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:46.160]  dramatically in the last 20 years and the republican party hasn't that's okay this this has happened
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:50.880]  a lot in american history where the parties are you know lagging indicators of reality but
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.480]  at some point they have to catch up and that's what you're seeing now and so what you're seeing
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.840]  is not again the destruction of the republican party what you're seeing is the imminent exile
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.000]  of the people who run the republican party to somewhere else i mean they're obviously not on
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.600]  board and that's fine but the party itself is becoming something very very different um and
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  it should i'm not saying it should go full crazy populist or anything like that but i'm saying it
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:19.520]  does need to adjust think of it this way for all the attention they get the people in washington
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.640]  who truly hate trump and never trump people um it's pretty small group i mean i don't know what
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.520]  percentage of the population of america they comprise but i mean way under one percent i think
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.440]  your point about influencing him is the smartest of all points that nobody ever makes but look
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.160]  at if you disagree with trump if you think he's uninformed on the issues and i think he is uninformed
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:43.040]  on some of the issues why not inform him why not suborn him rather than saying you're going to
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:47.600]  beat him in a street fight which are not because you're a pudgy soft-handed little intellectual
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.880]  dork from dc you're never going to beat trump in a fight of course and they haven't they spent
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:54.640]  a half a billion dollars trying to beat him when they haven't why don't you try to win him over
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:58.960]  why don't you try to inform him why don't you try and transfer some of your ideas to him go down to
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:02.960]  florida chucker i hate to even say this because it's inside baseball and they'll run with it i
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.720]  don't want to hurt trump trump listens to what we say they tell us watch next week i'm coming
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.320]  out against the fellow reserve watch next week and then i personally end up talking to him some
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:18.000]  off air and he literally is either the biggest manipulator ever or he's for real he's he literally
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:23.040]  listens to what i and others say it's amazing other people don't even think about trying to
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:27.440]  inform him i mean if you don't earnly if you're not airing in and you go up and actually talk to
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:33.440]  trump he will listen to you exactly exactly so why not go down to florida and say look mr trump
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.880]  you're great you've done a great job explaining the republican party you think you're awesome
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.560]  but here's the thing about trade that you should know whatever i mean or try to convince him
[01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:46.960]  try to win him over calling him a nazi is not the same as debating him or trying to suborn him
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:53.840]  or do things that adults do like look nobody in a position of leadership goes to war as a first
[01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:59.600]  option the romans didn't the ottomans didn't know why his ruler immediately declares war on his
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.400]  opponents he tries to negotiate first to try and win that's the thing trump is really nice if
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.360]  you're successful and you've been successful and he will listen to you and at least take the council
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.320]  but if you attack him first he listens to nothing you say but everybody's like that i'm like that
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:19.120]  you're like that most people are like that and everybody most people operate that way except
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:24.240]  the leaders of the republican party who are so stupid and so walled off in their tiny little
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.400]  world that they thought they could make this guy go away and the reason they thought that was they
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.240]  didn't take him seriously and they didn't take his voters seriously they don't care what their
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:38.000]  voters think they think their voters are stupid they're snake handling evangelicals in the south
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:45.200]  their idiot oxycontin addicted you know dumb people in appalachia and their survivalists out west
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:49.600]  and they can just shut up and vote for the nominee that the party gives them and by the way that's
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:55.200]  worked but it stopped working this cycle and they refuse to acknowledge that at some point you have
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.800]  to engage your own voters you have to listen to them maybe you moderate them you try to bring them
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:02.960]  along but you have to reach some accommodation you can't just give them the finger and tell them
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.720]  you're going to impose something on them that doesn't work in a democracy and you think they
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.720]  would know that but they didn't and now they're going to be punished and destroyed for it and by
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:16.800]  the way even though i'm not fully on board with trump i i have some concerns i have zero sympathy
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:21.200]  for the people who run the republican party well that's my issue i have a lot of issues with ron and
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:26.560]  horrible i think they deserve to lose their purchase of power they live in the richest city in the world
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:31.840]  and the only reason it is is because it's close physically to those in power i think the whole
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.240]  arrangement is disgusting and they deserve to be replaced by people who are a little smarter and
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:40.960]  a little more responsive to actual americans i do think that and i see the republican and democratic
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:46.000]  leadership is just completely arrogant out of touch like never before oh look at that i mean
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.720]  wait the sad thing about the trump story is it's obscured this amazing thing that's happening on the
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:56.720]  left where hillary clinton has been revealed to someone who does not represent her party at all
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:02.240]  hillary clinton is totally out of step with the democratic base the only reason that's not obvious
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:07.040]  is because she's done what every democratic president for my lifetime has done which is scare
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:12.480]  minority voters into supporting him or her through accusations of racism that's right she's stolen it
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:17.440]  from sanders as much as i hate him it's true she stole it early on but it's okay now the republicans
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:22.240]  are getting ready to change the rules and steal it from trump this is insane let's play a clip of
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:27.840]  one of these liberals uh you may have seen it because handi played this where she's sitting
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:31.680]  there saying you're not allowed to interview a woman of color because you're white it is this
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:39.440]  insane racism and self-loathing that is just over the top here's the clip so i'm saying no you do
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:45.920]  not have permission to walk around videotaping women of color and acting like you can do that and
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:50.320]  the rest of this can't aren't you quite aware by holding that video camera on me that you are
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:57.760]  surrounded by your privilege right take your privilege somewhere else please all right because
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:04.880]  your privilege is not welcome here so unless you are here to dismantle your privilege please find
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:10.640]  somewhere else to go that's the rebel pundit with that info and it just goes on and on with
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:15.280]  in the same clip is them saying we're communists we're gonna kill you and they come up so you're
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:21.840]  gonna kill and they go oh no i don't mean literally kill i mean where do these rich yuppie kids crawl
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.400]  out from under a rock well yeah i'm sure i don't know who that woman is i'm sure she has tenure
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.840]  somewhere i'm sure i'm sending her money every month it's getting my kids yeah the ironies about
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.160]  but i guess i just take three steps back where do you think this ends up when you encourage
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.760]  stuff like this when you encourage groups of people to hate each other based on immutable
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.400]  characteristics like skin color what do you think the end game is the end game is something
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:47.680]  really really ugly look at the rest of the world tugger stay there stay there tugger
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:53.600]  carlson dailycaller.com when i come back and ask the fox pundit where he thinks the end game is

[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:50.080]  end game is trying to shut down free speech from the left uh you're going to be covering rnc dnc
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:57.280]  obviously for fox news and the daily caller but what else is in the end game well i mean i i do
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:03.600]  think that is uh a goal of many on the left i this idea that hate speech whatever that is
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.640]  hate speech is defined as something i don't agree with um is somehow not protected by the first
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:13.440]  amendment is taught as fact on college campuses so you're seeing an entire generation of kids
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:17.680]  growing up who believe that there are some things that you shouldn't be allowed to say it should be
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.240]  punished for saying when of course that you know the whole idea of america is that you can say what
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.200]  you think is true uh what is the end game i don't know i mean i'll tell you what i fear is tribalism
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.800]  and that is the main problem in most countries in the rest of the world people hate each other based
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.560]  on how they look or where they're from and so you have these societies that are not cohesive at all
[01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.480]  where no one can relax that has dumbed down dumbed down balkanization and isn't that clearly the
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:51.920]  left's main mode of control i i mean i i don't know if that is intentional or not i mean i think
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:57.600]  most people including most on the left work by instinct i clearly they're driven by self loathing
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.760]  and by the idea that america itself is illegitimate so they're really not conscious i mean i agree with
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:05.760]  you because when i talk to them they're so stupid i don't mean to be elitist i never thought of
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:10.640]  myself as that smart i thought like quiet trendies must be real smart you talk to them they're
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:16.000]  literally morons yeah well i think that's i think that's true i mean i think most people don't kind
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.520]  of think through the implications of what they believe they kind of motor on day by day by instinct
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.800]  but i do think you want to consciously try to prevent your society from becoming balkanized
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:31.200]  the idea that you can have many cultures living harmoniously next to one another is false it's
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:35.280]  never happened you can have many races living next to each other many religions but you have to
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:39.360]  share a common culture a common set of beliefs you have to be engaged you got to buy into the
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:45.440]  country you got to buy into free market you got to buy a free speech exactly or else you're divided
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:51.280]  and that just doesn't end well and the one thing that bumps me out about america i love this country
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.680]  but people don't have a global perspective like they don't have a sense of what the histories of
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:59.520]  other countries are and what they've done wrong and what the consequences of that have been
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:03.520]  and if you just pay a little bit of attention you see that's the single biggest impediment
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:09.040]  to having a happy country is tribalism balkanization multiculturalism whatever you want to call it we
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:14.400]  all you need to be need to be united in a common set of beliefs exactly they don't want to melting
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:17.920]  pot they want to all be in our own little group and then they try to like an orchestra
[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:23.120]  control us that is not going to work never has total tower of babble thedailycollar.com

[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:33.360]  well everybody knows that i celebrate humanity and i love the empowerment of humanity and
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:37.920]  america's not perfect but i love our country and i love our military because they may get
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:42.320]  sent on some good missions some bad missions but when it comes to the opposite of some of the
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:48.640]  leftist anti-american communist slugs that we see out of these anti-trump rallies and the rest of it
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:52.480]  uh there's our military and then our special forces and i can't get into obviously because i
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:57.040]  don't even want to know and don't get to know all the special units that tim kennedy's part of
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:02.160]  some of the stuff he's done just know this he rewrote the army's close quarters combat manual
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:06.880]  a few years ago and it's basically based on uh the training and things he's done he's been
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:12.880]  part of a lot of obviously elite military units and secret operations uh around the world uh and
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.040]  it's you know pretty much a chris kyle level uh career and then some uh but these guys don't
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:21.920]  brag on the army it's okay the navy sills do we love them as well but i tell you tim so much
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:27.600]  happening we had you set up the show a while back a few days ago and then boom this happens uh this
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:35.120]  morning there is so much to get into tim kennedy mm a dot com on twitter tim kimony uh mm a facebook
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:40.400]  dot com forward slash tim kennedy and then of course you have your sheepdog response uh that is so
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:45.440]  integral and uh so key and then of course you're doing your um uh you know middle heavyweight fighting
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:51.840]  there uh at the ufc so much going on you're one of the co-host investigators on a great show uh
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:57.280]  hunting kitler and then behind the scenes you've got all this other military career going on so a
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:01.600]  very very busy guy and one reason i was asking you what areas you want to get into it was a lot
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:06.400]  of it i know uh you obviously can't can't talk about but some we will so great to have you here
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:11.840]  my friend great to have you and shane here today uh fellow texans where do you want to start obviously
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:17.440]  probably the situation in europe yeah when we talked last time isa said just come out and said that
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:22.640]  they're uh wanting to kill me you know they want to behead me and fbi came and said hey you're on
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:28.240]  the hit list and when we talked then i said this isn't the beginning uh this isn't the end this is
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:34.240]  the beginning you're like from samba and edino to paris cologne germany this is just the start of it
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:39.840]  and i think we even discussed specifically belgium and i said it's going to be coming to the u k and
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:44.640]  that we talked about we did and here we are just you know like a few weeks later a month later
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:50.560]  and it's come to fruition that's scary uh it's nowhere near ending it's just starting this is
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:57.600]  the beginning of what i think is going to be a horrific change in the in europe and uh it's it's
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:04.960]  it's truly a horrific change of events let me ask you the question why do you think merkel heland
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:09.120]  would advertise to turkey to bring these people in why are they bringing them here why are they
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:14.160]  not even checking their ids that's in the news they won't tell governors like ours where they're
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:20.160]  going what the numbers are we've investigated reports coming out next week it's 20 times what
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:27.680]  they're saying conservatively what's going on yeah it's it's the conjecture can only go so far to say
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:34.000]  we know what happens when the increase when the percentage increases of the muslims in a respective
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:40.160]  area and the corresponding terrorist attacks that go along with it the the paris um attacker that
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:45.280]  just got arrested last week you know we talked about these muslim majorities that you know are
[02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:50.720]  saying oh these are bad horrific acts but this guy has been living there in the open for the past
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:58.560]  month and they know and they knew that this guy was there and they let him just live his life so if
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:02.880]  if we if this is a testament if this is an example of what can happen so we know what happened in
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:06.720]  paris and we know what they're capable of and then he went back into muslim community and
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:13.120]  they just disappeared he didn't have to hide he could stay in the open and with no fear or consequence
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:19.040]  for what he did no other group would support something like that no and that is is going to
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:22.240]  happen everywhere else that's going to happen here that's going to happen in the uk it's
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:25.920]  going to happen again in france it's going to happen again in germany this is just the beginning
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.160]  well you predicted it when you were here a few months ago specifically from your training your
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:36.880]  background all over the world um in national security you name it specifically why were you
[02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.920]  saying it's coming why is it going to get worse and then again how does the political structure
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:46.240]  think it's going to get away with bringing five million into europe hundreds of thousands into
[02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:52.560]  the us when it kicks off like sam bernadino what's the calculus politically that the political
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:58.880]  class won't get in trouble for that you know i i have no idea how the politicians can continue to
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:06.160]  escape this very clear statistic of there's x number of terrorists with this group of populace
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.960]  that you're bringing in so if you have let's just say conservatively ten percent uh which is very
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:14.560]  conservative they're saying the radicalized majority of the immigrants that are going to be
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:18.880]  brought to the u.s somewhere between 20 and 30 percent have been radicalized that they are fanatics
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:23.920]  and that are looking for an opportunity to execute a mission that so let's just say 10 percent that's
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:28.480]  one in 10 right so if you're going to bring somebody over to your house for dinner 10 people
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.240]  one of which could be a terrorist you're still going to invite them over no you're not that's
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:39.040]  insane right there's not a chance you'd bring any of them at the at 10 percent at one percent
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.840]  but we know that it's somewhere between 10 and 20 percent so that the current establishment is letting
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.000]  these people in and they're they're they're not vetting them they're welcoming them with open arms
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  there has to be a bigger picture here of why they're doing it i don't know what that is i can only
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.600]  you know in my worst nightmare imagine what's going to happen if we continue to let them in
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.960]  it's going to be more attacks uh that are just going to get more and more horrific
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:05.440]  well germany and france have declared civil emergencies and they've taken libertarian and
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:10.400]  nationalist groups rights they've arrested marie lapin who is the nationalist front-runner for
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:16.640]  president she's not even as hardcore as trump she's she's more like a ronald reagan uh and they
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.560]  they've they've arrested her twice now they're talking about putting her in prison for saying
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:25.120]  we're facing the greatest threat since nazi germany and france from radical muslims they have
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:30.320]  arrested her and say they may disqualify her from president so to me it's pretty clear the left is
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:36.240]  allied with these shahadis and protecting them i don't understand why you know that that's the
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:41.520]  the big question for me to um seek an answer for is why why are they protecting them you know the
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:47.120]  the obvious implications of political correctness you know it's been driven and pounded into us
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:52.160]  for now the past 10 years no you know i realize that you live in san bernadino and you think that
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:56.880]  the people living next door to you look suspicious and um they're dressed they're dressed in acting
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.920]  like radicals but no you can't say anything because you know that would be racist so don't
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:06.640]  say anything well the fbi two years before was on them and got pulled off and almost charged
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.040]  for civil rights violation going after those very two they should have gotten an award to be on the
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:18.240]  very two yeah they the opportunities to to end this we can't call a religion anymore because
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:23.440]  when a religion then becomes a cult the shift is clear it's not an ideology of trying to
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:29.680]  to peacefully appreciate you know some deity this at this juncture is trying to change at a fundamental
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:35.120]  fundamental level um a way of life and that's our way of life the american way of life and
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:39.120]  they are going at it every single way that they can if if there's a form of liberty they want
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:45.760]  it to be destroyed whether it's suicide bomb or ridiculous propaganda they're trying to very
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:50.320]  efficiently destroy what we view as well sure as someone argue oh well we went into their
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:56.160]  countries and did all this but then they go and attack the non-radical countries and then
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:01.440]  all these liberal countries who aren't involved at all this that's who they go attack so it seems
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:07.840]  like the more you kiss their butt the more they attack you yeah the the idea of um tolerance that
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.640]  we we could just be more accepting and if we if we opened our doors and open arms and hug them and
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:16.880]  show them and try to appreciate their culture that is completely moronic and idiotic there is not a
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:22.160]  single ounce of support statistically or anywhere in my experience that would demonstrate that makes
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:26.000]  any sense well you've been over there constantly a lot of the locals obviously invited forces trying
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.640]  to stabilize things and and and some of the wars were obviously wrong i mean i'm not defending any
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:35.040]  of that but i talked to bigs who was over in brussels right after the attacks days after and he said
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:40.720]  more people were angry at them for being quote europeans or westerners than he saw in afghanistan
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:46.080]  or iraq and so he was questioning they get more radicalized once they come into leftist countries
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:52.640]  yeah it's because it's a it's a vacuum it's an opportunity for their fanatic ideology to grow
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:57.200]  to blossom it's a fertile environment where they have limitless restrictions so you know if you're
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:03.440]  if you're in northern iraq and you want to you know be part of isis there are some there's some
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:08.720]  pushback you know the Kurds are going to try to kill you um like there there is obviously the american
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:13.440]  forces are there in in a straight up looking for an opportunity a lot of the non radical Muslims
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:18.080]  aren't naive they don't want the Wahhabis because they know bomb start dropping drones start flying
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:22.480]  they don't want anything they don't want those guys near them but then they come to belgium
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:28.320]  and there's no drones there's no american forces there's no there's no Kurds it's just a perfect
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:35.040]  ripe fertile environment for them to grow organically right there um the these fanatic
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:38.560]  create i mean they're crazy they're crazy they tried to attack bigs and my crew and
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:42.400]  to run cars into them they couldn't even get in businesses it was like a movie they were just get
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:48.160]  out of here yeah i was i was there last year for us a tour in belgium and i was riding on a train
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:52.400]  and me and three other americans were we're sitting there together and there was this girl
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:58.800]  that got on to the train and three middleish middle eastern men kind of started maneuvering
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:04.640]  around this girl very aggressively and everybody started like shifting away to not look at what
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:10.640]  was going on and and me and my friends are like oh hell no is this going to happen right in front
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:15.200]  of us so we stood up and we went and sat next to the girl she was shaking because she knew what was
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.240]  about to happen she was going to be brought that's like it was americans in france that stood for the
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:23.040]  god with the gun yes they were all the way down yeah everybody else on the train um with the train
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.960]  going into paris where when the guy came out of the the bathroom with a gun within linear target
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:32.640]  that is a dream come true for a terrorist all he has to shoot is shoot down this train everything
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:35.680]  in front of him is going to die now a couple americans on the train says no we saw this in
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:41.360]  9-11 not going to happen again what i'm saying is it is uh it is so it's such an opportunistic
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:46.480]  place for them to walk into the immune system no there's nothing there there's nothing to
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:53.600]  there's no antibodies if we're gonna we're gonna use that metaphor to to fight back yes if i was
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:58.800]  in a radical muslim country i'd want to get away with you know get out of it and be free i just
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:04.240]  don't know why they come to the west and they get even worse so especially in you know brussels
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:09.200]  belgium uk france they would board a flight the flight of turkey they'd fight for isis for you
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:16.480]  know a a period of time and then then they now have battlefield experience they have grown
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:25.120]  this deep-seated brother power there's nothing like the the bonds forged in war they're empowered
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:30.720]  right and then they come back to belgium or to brussels or to france or the uk uh you know
[02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:35.040]  they're now experienced war fighters they're wolves around a bunch of sheep yeah and now
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:40.160]  in comes the sheep dogs well hopefully you know there has to be so i i run a company's sheep dog

[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:30.800]  he's kind of talk about it i'm not pushing to do it like i said you don't have to and he was not
[02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:35.280]  i want to go ahead so that's coming up but this is a really great guy and i'm so glad that my old
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.120]  high school buddy who i've been friends with since high school changed down her trains with this guy
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:44.160]  and that's how i got to know him a fellow text and it's it's really amazing you can follow him on
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:50.320]  twitter tim kennedy uh mma again at tim kennedy mma and of course uh there's just a lot of key
[02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:55.280]  information there okay tim this is a short segment long segment coming up there's so much
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:25:01.200]  to get into let's talk about sheepdog response and how important it is not just for islamic
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:06.000]  terrorists but criminals or whatever the case is because clearly our economy worldwide is
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.600]  is unraveling crime is starting to go up i even want to make the time to try to go out and get back
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.920]  into firearms and get back into self-defense because being a father being a broadcaster
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:20.000]  i used to be really good with guns and all the rest of it quite frankly only going out shooting
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:25.440]  five or six times a year i'm a shadow of my former self i personally need to get involved as well
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:32.000]  tell us about sheepdog response yeah the the idea is pretty clear the so a sheepdog you know when
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.840]  you're surrounded by wolves and you're a sheep you're just you're just a prey the predators are
[02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:39.760]  going to do whatever they want the sheepdog is that one thing that has all of the characteristics
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:48.640]  like a wolf but can still kill you know it has the teeth it has the canines um maybe i'm selfish
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:53.760]  maybe i i love my family too much but i'm no longer and i don't think any american should
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:58.400]  be able to hang back and just be like you know i'm gonna let what happens around me happen
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:01.840]  like that's you're not going to be metro sexual like these people getting beat up at the knockout
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:07.360]  game and getting fatal positions no uh i'm gonna be the guy that recognize the group of people
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:11.040]  that are coming across the streets i'm gonna use atmospherics and biometrics to say hey that group of
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.560]  guy guys do not look like they have good intent so i'm gonna move my family away from that and
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:20.960]  then or if i'm by myself and i see them looking for an opportunity looking for that prey you know
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:25.680]  like i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna i know exactly what's coming and i train people about how not to be
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:31.760]  in brussels in belgium in paris when these type of things are gonna happen and uh we give people
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:36.000]  the tools to survive you know you are going to be the hardest person that and someone ever tries to
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.640]  kill that is the point that is the idea that if heaven forbid you are ever in a situation that
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:45.360]  somebody's going to try to kill you it's not going to be easy that you will be hard to kill and that
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:50.560]  is not something that just happens it's not just a perspective it's training it's practice it's
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:54.320]  something that you have to dedicate your life to so when they try to hurt you when they try to hurt
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:59.760]  your family it's a dead end you're a hard target and that's the opposite of what the status want
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:04.240]  they want us to be these jellyfish that don't know how to defend ourselves we have to go to the system
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:10.960]  to protect us yeah the the system cannot protect us the system cannot protect an individual and
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:14.560]  when we talk about individual the individual responsibility this is an idea that goes back
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:18.560]  to the beginning of libertarianism to be in a constitutionalist to the founding fathers
[02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:21.440]  they said you know you're going to be responsible for your property you're going to be responsible
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:25.040]  for your family you're going to be responsible for you for your products for your cattle for your
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:32.000]  livestock um for your farm uh and then for somehow in the past 50 60 years we've forgotten
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.600]  that that's what it kind of means to be an american that you're going to be strong enough to be able
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:39.440]  to take care of yourself and take care of those around you you're going to work hard we have to
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:44.640]  get back there we have to get back there or our way of life is at an end and you know knowing what
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:49.280]  you guys are into it's amazing i mean you're into getting raw milk you're into gardens you're into
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:53.920]  that's all the really manly stuff it's not just the fighting not to trade your family it's 360
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:28:00.160]  being self-sufficient that's the answer and is that not what is truly empowering yeah the yeah
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:04.240]  it's it's fun to shoot a gun it's fun to get into the gym to work out and it's fun to you know work
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:08.240]  on hand-to-hand combat and martial arts uh but that's only a small piece of it you know like the
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:13.200]  community being part of a group of people that are like-minded that will support you and fight for
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:17.520]  you you know if i picked up my phone i could call a hundred people that would be at my doorstep to
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:24.240]  fight to the death with me within five minutes you know like i feed my family the best gem killin
[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:29.200]  he's got a posse yeah like within five minutes i have a posse when when when isis said they're
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:33.600]  going to come kill me i probably had a hundred thousand people contact me and say i'll be at your
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:39.680]  door i'll 24 seven be living in front of your house to protect you so there's plenty of americans
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:44.080]  that are like-minded like that you can connect with them they're out there you know it's it's so being
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:47.920]  a libertarian is more than just but those cowards always hit soft targets so they don't want to come
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:52.560]  after you no they don't they they they will look for the softest easiest opportunity they're not
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:55.760]  going to go after you they're not going to go after me they're going to say that they will so
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:00.480]  they can look tough in front of their friends but they're pussies that's what they love to chop
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:04.800]  little kids heads they love yeah they do they love women they love children they love unarmed
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:09.440]  journalists they love people see that is so fundamentally dishonorable from the entire western
[02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:17.600]  chivalry where did this filth come from so for them the the measure of success is fear that's
[02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:22.960]  what it is so it doesn't matter if you're uh if you go and fight another capable soldier
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:29.360]  and hurt him or fail you achieve nothing let's say you kill him you really invoke no fear but
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:34.160]  if you go to the brussels airport and you blow a bomb up and you hurt you blow up the americans
[02:29:34.160 --> 02:29:38.880]  the american airlines line boom you now have instilled fear in everyone around the world
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:43.280]  and you expect them to cower and then bow down it just shows how their perspective is completely
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:47.120]  different stay there i want to talk about that because this was an attack on the us folks we put
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:54.480]  an article out we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:04.640]  a wave of bombings that killed at least 30 people in brussels was carried out by ices militants the
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:10.080]  group has claimed reports the independent in a statement released through one of its propaganda
[02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:16.800]  outlets the so-called islamic states said explosive belts in devices were used islamic state fighters
[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:22.640]  opened fire inside of an airport before several of them detonated their explosive belts as a martyrdom
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:28.640]  bomber detonated his explosive belt in a metro station a spokesperson said the attacks resulted
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:35.920]  in more than 230 dead and wounded ices said belgium was targeted as a country participating
[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:41.280]  in the international coalition against the islamic state the timing of the attacks coming days after
[02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:45.920]  the arrest of a pair of suspects was considered significant but no mention of the captured
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:51.840]  militant was made as the death toll rose amid continuing rescue operations ices supporters
[02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:58.320]  had been championing the attacks on twitter you can find more reports on info wars dot com

[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:14.000]  research tim kennedy i mean not only just research but the the corrosion of liberty like it can't
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:20.560]  happen immediately you know like if we go back to you know 1770s and you raise taxes on t and
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:26.640]  we're going to throw um crap into the bay like they recognized early on that that's not how
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:32.960]  you can go about it you have to slowly erode the idea of liberty so let's align you know let's
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:38.880]  let's take the left and let's align ourselves with an ideology that will continue to make huge
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:46.160]  horrific uh terrible um events take place so that they can attack slowly and methodically
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:51.840]  our way of life um that they can erode our freedom they can take away our guns they can take away
[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:55.840]  our freedom of speech that they can you know get rid of search and seizure that they can
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:00.800]  try to get a backdoor into every single one of our phones this is don't don't be can don't
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:05.760]  think for a second that all this is not by design you know they want to be in your phone they want
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:10.400]  to read the FBI finally been yesterday we can get into the phone all along and i'm not even
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:14.560]  against the FBI themselves but these big multinationals i mean they're letting the
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:19.120]  chinese government into the USA now you can't give these codes up because the government
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:25.040]  has been pretty much seized by foreign interests what what happened to you know a patriot an american
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:30.400]  you know a barrel-tested freedom fighter being that guy that would say no i believe in our way of
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:35.040]  life and i don't care what happens i believe in a dangerous freedom over you know like peaceful
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:39.440]  slavery what what happened to that idea now we're just we're willing to give away everything we're
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:46.800]  willing to give away um access to our phones to our emails to our homes um you know like even our
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:51.520]  all right to us peacefully assemble or to speak but when the jihadi leader in sambaradino for years
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:56.560]  was on facebook saying i'm gonna carry out jihad went to terror training camps the FBI knew legally
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:02.560]  had the intel weren't allowed to bust her they want because they wanted to happen they can't take away
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:07.520]  our freedoms they can't take away our liberties unless they have an examples uh to specifically
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:12.720]  reference that say look man if we were able to get into those guys's phones in sambaradino
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:16.960]  just like yours and mine uh then we could have prevented this and then we have 350 million
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:21.600]  americans are like oh my goodness what we're saying what what same person wouldn't want to be able to
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:27.120]  stop that you know like so letting it happen is the type of false flag and it's a fact the local
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:31.040]  FBI tried to do their job within the law they could have stopped it they're ordered by the
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:36.320]  justice department and threatened with with a trial for civil rights violations the people they
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:42.080]  targeted are absolutely terrorist they don't get awards they get in trouble and then the political
[02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:46.960]  people the justice department say give us all your freedom when they bottom line protected the
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:51.520]  the terrorist you know i'm not saying that the american government saying yes let the jihadists
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:57.040]  fly planes into building sure but elements are what what i'm saying is that they are now becoming
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:01.360]  opportunistic that saying every time one of these things happened is just an opportunity to take away
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:06.560]  more american freedom sure that's what's happening that is exactly what's happening and whether they're
[02:40:07.760 --> 02:40:12.800]  creating opportunities for these things to happen or they're just opportunistically saying i'm
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:16.480]  going to take advantage of this well some of the corrupt elements on top are undoubtedly there and
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:21.280]  so here's my question everybody i talk to who's been in combat is more awake than the public
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:25.360]  but i talk to special forces people across the board for the most awake people i talk to
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:30.000]  i talk to a lot of cops they're awake as well but then i see the power structure doing bad
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:34.800]  stuff but then the very members of the structure that do the enforcement are some of the best people
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:39.520]  i know have you found that paradox have you found that number that statistic and what does that
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:44.320]  represent because give true from what i've seen that's got to freak out some of the bad guys they're
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:48.640]  not all bad at the top it's got to freak them out knowing that their own foot soldiers are awake
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:57.280]  they have to be scared to death when you look at the the mean the body of the american special
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:02.640]  operations community they're guys like me you know they they are trained they're educated they're
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:08.640]  smart they're well traveled um you know multilingual and we understand the bigger picture of things
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:12.880]  that they they wish they probably do they wish that they could just hang back and
[02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:18.400]  have a bunch of lemmings that they could tell hey go get rid of these people go destroy this
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:22.720]  this culture this way of life but that's not how it is you have very very intelligent people that
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:27.280]  are finally seeing the big picture you know it's like we've peaked behind and seen you know the
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:31.920]  the guy that's pulling all the strings and we're done with it we we understand and now we're taking
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.560]  action to to hopefully effect change and that's what you're doing here today you have a lot of
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:42.240]  courage to be here buddy to to a degree you know the um but you'll have no country we don't stand
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:48.640]  up so i love i love this way of life you know like i'm i fought for it i believe in it and it's yours
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:52.400]  and i'm gonna continue to fight for it and maybe i have to do do it a different way from not from
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:58.080]  behind the gun anymore well you're doing a great job across the board and folks really respect you
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:02.560]  and appreciate you you know i get misrepresented all the time it's like jade helm i never said jade
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:07.040]  helm and was a takeover they were coming to take our guns the military would never do that i said
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:11.760]  it's more conditioning to make it about domestic operations like you just said earlier instead
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.560]  of fighting real threats and then i've since talked to other folks in special ops they say no alex
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.960]  you know we know you said that we know they misrepresented and then i see them doing that
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:24.640]  and then they go on the news in thousands of publications and say that i said they were coming
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:31.600]  to texas to take the guns uh what's your real view on jade helm uh it's a fantastic training
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:38.000]  opportunity for guys like me and guys uh in my field to come to the best areas in the world to
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:44.160]  train you know like texas actually just the south central southwest southeast that those are this is
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:50.080]  a great area you know like with the everglades and louisiana the mississippi river you know to do
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:55.520]  amphibious assaults to be able to jump into ranches there's no place like you know even texas that has
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:01.520]  such amount of land for us to do things um so it's a great opportunity on the small side of the
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:07.360]  military side for us to get better at what we do uh but then on the flip side it's also a way for
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:15.680]  the you know the american populace to get used to seeing military activity in their area so that's
[02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:20.160]  scary you know like i i don't like that idea of hey let's get the american people used to
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:26.320]  seeing humvees and you know polaris razors and guys jumping out of c 130s or black hawks
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:31.760]  um halloween into some ranches in texas that's that's a scary thought that we're doing it but
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:36.640]  um from an individual standpoint man what a great training opportunity like i want to
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:40.800]  i love being part of it i love training i love doing that because it makes me a better warfighter
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:46.800]  but then the flip side is that we're now desensitizing the american people into having military
[02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:50.960]  operations in our own country sure the media spends it that i hate the military once the opposite
[02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:56.000]  all i'm saying is they're trying to get rid of possecom and totis generals have warned of it uh
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:00.400]  and so i'm glad that you and others have you know made that point uh separately i want to
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:04.560]  get into the bundy ranch situation a moment also talked about ufc uh you know you've been
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:08.000]  tested you're clean but you know you just got recently tested you haven't talked about that yet
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:16.560]  so i want you to expand on that but separately we see these moves to use the military domestically
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:20.400]  and my issue is they're not even saying we're going to use it against terrorists or jihadists
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:26.480]  but it's for veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians and the tea party and then a quote
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:30.240]  coming war with the tea party is coming i know that's in the army training it's even been in the
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:34.160]  army times i know that's one of the things that's woken the military up they've told me when they
[02:44:34.160 --> 02:44:39.440]  call people in and say quote like ford hood two years ago's and fox news the founding fathers
[02:44:39.440 --> 02:44:44.320]  wouldn't be welcome in today's military including jorge washington well jorge washington founded
[02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:52.640]  the u.s. army that's got to tell you there's some bad people at the top um they wouldn't you know
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:59.200]  that that what the founding fathers were would be considered to be domestic terrorists and uh
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:05.200]  how frightening is that where you know what what i consider be a true patriot a true american that
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:11.120]  somebody that believes in liberty and freedom uh that that that is uh an ideology or that that that's
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:20.400]  a approach to um freedom that we we don't want in our military that's scary what did the leftist
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:24.080]  think of the last six seven years well they began because that's been the news trying to train the
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:29.600]  military that that george washington the founders are bad men are bad the family is bad private
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:33.280]  property is bad i mean if i was trying to turn them against the establishment i would do that is
[02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:38.560]  that how disconnected the left is that they would call in officers and special ops and in
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:44.560]  brainwashing because it isn't working north koreans had trouble brainwashing our troops
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:51.680]  certainly a bunch of leftists can't uh no they can't but you know indoctrination there's nothing
[02:45:51.680 --> 02:46:00.400]  you can do about it you know if you continuously um put some a subject under constant scrutiny and
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:05.200]  even their job performance will be limited in the success that they could see in their career
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:11.440]  by where they align themselves politically um you have no choice if you if you want to be successful
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:18.560]  at your job to then in some ways or another cower to what the what they're trying to project into
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:23.920]  the military you know it's unfortunate but if you want to be successful in the military to some degree
[02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:28.080]  you have to align yourself with this sure but the good news is correct me if i'm wrong and you
[02:46:28.080 --> 02:46:32.480]  already said this earlier almost all the special ops people i run into talk to talk to others
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:35.760]  i've talked to like herinal schaefer around the end i've been logging units countless others on
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:42.000]  record have said hey don't worry almost all the informed people in the military know exactly
[02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:48.640]  what's going on alex and uh you know we've got your six is basically what i've been told it would be a
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:55.440]  huge catastrophic failure of uh an idea to say we're going to take special operations and we're
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:01.440]  going to have them go get guns from americans let's just like use this crazy example of hey we're
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:05.280]  going to go door to door and you know like let's say katrina happened again and we're going to send
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:10.640]  special ops to to prevent um you know riots we're going to send in the special forces to go get
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:15.440]  grabbed guns you're going to have a bunch of you know guys from louisiana and texas and mississippi
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:18.640]  and alabama and florida that are in special operations that are in special forces they're
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:23.120]  going to be like no bro not going to happen well it turns out a lot of them did say no in katrina
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.920]  and the media lied and said they went for yeah it didn't happen another saw yeah they showed a few
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:32.960]  units doing it it was all bull yeah it's insane uh we know you're not going to find guys that believe
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:38.080]  in freedom more than the special operations community you know they they bleed it they fight
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:42.640]  for it they love it they live it um you know that people are like all the time are attacking me
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:48.320]  they're saying you're you're just a pawn for this the big federal movement trying to manipulate
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:54.160]  this or that like do it bro you know thank god that that that so many patriots are aware of
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:58.480]  what's happening and that's a real ace in the hole and i gotta say it there's a lot of bad stuff with
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:02.400]  the police but on average they're more awake to the public and that's why george soros wants to fund
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:07.920]  this attack the local police shoot a cop pump and gas to further destabilize the country and it's just
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:14.000]  not working now i believe blue you know my my dad's police officer i went to the police academy
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  1999 my brother's a police officer um you know these these are guys that put their lives on the
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.520]  line every single day no nobody's perfect you know they have a tough job you know if you're
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:27.680]  gonna be if you're gonna if you're gonna attack the police force go try to do a ride along for a
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.080]  day where every single car that you walk up to and every interaction that you have could potentially
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:39.520]  be somebody that's going to try to kill you it is a taxing soul wrenching occupation and these guys
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:46.000]  do it every single day with the sole purpose of trying to protect americans um yeah there's dudes
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:49.600]  that aren't perfect and and make mistakes my issue is if you don't like some of the stuff they're
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:55.120]  doing that's policy that's the legislature that's the city look in the mirror stop the government
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:49:01.200]  on top turning the police into gestapo yeah the the guys themselves that they're they're doing what
[02:49:01.200 --> 02:49:05.920]  their job is requiring them to do you know if you if you want to hear in austin they like our our
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:12.080]  police chief i disagree with him all the time and uh like the vast majority of time so i i try to
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:16.560]  affect change in that way where i specifically go to that municipal department and i try to
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:21.200]  express and let my voice be heard so that i can affect policy change uh if you're just
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:24.880]  standing back and then throwing stones at the at the police officers one you're not affecting
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:29.680]  change you're doing no you're gonna turn them against your idea it's the opposite it's idiotic
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:32.960]  i want to go to some calls i'm gonna skip this network break this is so powerful tim kennedy
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:37.680]  is here with us right now but since we got into this i don't know how much you can go into this
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:41.760]  but i'm gonna just say it right now joe biggs went out with david night a few months ago to cover the
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:48.000]  bunny situation and he got calls from people in special ops that he knew from iraq and afghanistan
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.320]  saying we've been called you need to get out of there or you and night may be arrested
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:56.880]  we're gonna see everybody out there is bad and night said he got a bunch of calls by the way
[02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:01.040]  he said what do you mean i'm here covering this i don't even agree with how they're handling this
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:04.880]  and they said you better get out of there well he he didn't get out of there and so i thought that
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:09.200]  was pretty aggressive and intimidating to the real press when they know we weren't like some of the
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:14.400]  fake press out there that was the concern and then i learned from shane about this i asked about
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:17.840]  us so you don't have to get into it he said no i want to get into it about what happened but we
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:21.840]  see the footage we're going to play in a minute of levoy finnicum and others in that truck they're
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:26.800]  shooting through the car whoever it is we've now learned it's it's now in the news in the
[02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:33.520]  oregonian bullet hole on levoy finnicum's truck traced to elite the fbi team bullet casings they're
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:38.960]  saying there's seven shots not four from the boy finnicum's shooting scene uh finnicum's shooting was
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:44.080]  bundy driver bodyguard an fbi agent provocateur that's the new american so this thing's not
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:51.280]  unraveling um and so tim kennedy um you want to tell folks your experience with us you know the uh
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:58.400]  well you know what happened to that those are farmers those are ranchers you know if that was
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:04.080]  a few thousand not even a few that was a thousand miles south that'd be my family you know like
[02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:09.120]  that's what they're farmers in california yeah you know and um they're no different than the bundys
[02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:14.480]  you know like uh no hey they're not as vocal obviously but you know like you just moved
[02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:20.560]  geographically thousand miles now you're on kennedy land you know attacking people saying that
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:25.280]  you know you can't be doing this um the tactics that were used there i've done that in africa
[02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:31.280]  i've done that in the middle east i've done that in south america um i'm not nor would i ever do it
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:35.840]  in organ or anywhere in the united states and that you know that's that's what hurt me is um
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:45.920]  those are farmers when we have guys walking into um a business in san brenadino and mowing
[02:51:45.920 --> 02:51:51.760]  people down that's terrorism you know some farmers that are saying hey get off our ranch this is how
[02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:55.600]  we want to do our ranch that's not terrorism you know when you have sure they'll argue well it was
[02:51:55.600 --> 02:51:59.920]  federal but the feds keep raising the rates where you can't be on it i mean i'm they they're running
[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:04.560]  everyone out they're stealing mines they're bragging about it on video but the bigger issue is
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:08.240]  some of the special ops people i mean can you get into that and the phone call you got her no i can't
[02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:16.080]  get into that you know the um ultimately i i mean i think it's a larger issue that people are getting
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:20.240]  calls like bigs and others to be told to shut up i mean for me that's the issue it's what you can
[02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:23.200]  argue about what really happened there but what are they doing calling people about their first
[02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:29.200]  amendment is that bad now too no especially you know this the community i come from is very small
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:34.240]  and everybody knows everybody when you're in an elite unit um there's nothing you like i know
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:39.520]  all the guys in every single unit in the united states um and what if one is at a place i know
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:44.800]  what's happening and i know what they're doing um and if you know i say something that doesn't
[02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:48.320]  support them because those are my friends like those are guys that i deployed with those guys
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:51.520]  i went to iraq with the guys i went to afghanistan with guys i went to pakistan with you know if
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:58.880]  these are these are people i've known for 10 15 20 years um and they they you know they're hurt
[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:03.680]  where and i'm not supporting them or they think i'm not supporting them um i support the american
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:07.120]  white life you know there's there's nothing you're not you're not going to put a muzzle on me and
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:12.720]  say i can't say that comes first absolutely and in my honesty in my in my well when did you get
[02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:15.840]  upset because i heard it was when you saw the footage we'll actually play some of it with audio
[02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:19.280]  right now where they're driving in the truck and bullets are shooting through it they're not shooting
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:25.360]  back i mean that's wrong yeah uh yeah shoot no shoot for me is pretty clear um you know the
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:30.080]  tactics of setting up a roadblock with a linear ambush guys in the tree line those are things
[02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:35.680]  that i i will do in afghanistan or iraq um those are things that i don't want to see happen in the
[02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:41.280]  united states um especially to farmers you know to ranchers listen i say if some farmer pulls
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:44.800]  a gun and starts shooting at you shoot them but just shooting up a car as it drives down the
[02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:51.600]  road that sounds ridiculous well i think you're on the right to say that's wrong and we're not
[02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:54.960]  attacking people that are involved in that we're saying what are the feds trying to get you to do
[02:53:56.160 --> 02:54:01.680]  i don't know and this is uh that's scary you know it just you you watch this you're like is this
[02:54:01.680 --> 02:54:06.000]  is this in syria where is this where is this wood line is this happening you know in northern
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:09.840]  afghanistan and the mountains yeah well if you got a predator drone you see guys loading explosives
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:13.360]  on the side of the road and they get the jeep and drive off then you shoot the jeep because you saw
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:17.600]  them loading bombs but these people weren't loading bombs no what were they driving to church or
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:20.480]  something to yeah they were driving to a meeting yeah they didn't they're shooting over here on
[02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:26.560]  there yeah you see ralph skipping off that car uh i don't know it didn't you know god save america
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:32.240]  this is um we got a lot we got a long way to go to get back to where we should be well that's the
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:36.800]  influence of the leftist that were in that fbi unit i know all about it and they they threaten
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:41.600]  people in this operation and others for simply trying to cover it and you know that that is the
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:46.320]  charity on top they would call people up and say you better shut your mouth and it's wrong
[02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:50.560]  we're not going to shut our mouths in the story okay or shut our mouths about the jihadi's you're
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:55.280]  bringing in any of it that's not america that's not what we're doing tim kennedy we've got your
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:01.200]  websites up we'll put them up on info wars dot com everybody should visit them cheap dog response
[02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  dot com tim kennedy mma dot com we're gonna take you five minutes the next hour because i want to go
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:12.640]  to six or seven calls uh let's go to uh tyler in fema region to whatever former state that was on
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:18.880]  the east coast tyler on the air with tim kennedy go ahead um yes i wanted to get you and tim as a
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:27.840]  champion um i get a prince and i'm actually an army rpc uh and i recently i had to jump through a
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:34.960]  bunch of hoops basically to get a concealed carry permit in the state of new jersey and i was called
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:40.480]  back a week after posting pictures of me and some friends at a range saying that if i promote the
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:45.760]  second amendment i may be a violation of the hatchet act and that i could basically have my rtc
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:49.760]  scholarship ripped away so there you go if you are seen promoting the second amendment legally
[02:55:49.760 --> 02:55:56.080]  and lawfully you might lose your rotc commission see the first amendment bullying so what's your
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:04.160]  specific question sir i was just uh asked i just wanted to know uh as far as like when i see the
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:09.360]  people i go to school with their total sheep it's almost like they worship the idea of being destroyed
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:16.400]  like lambs to the slaughter and their their their solution would be to basically roll over to it
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:21.760]  whereas most people most people your question is what do you do living in a gun freeze down with
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:26.240]  a bunch of sheep great question uh you're talking to the ultimate sheep dog here uh tim kennedy tim
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:32.480]  so you know that what is preventing me from killing alex across from here right now you know is it
[02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:36.560]  do i need a gun to do it i don't you know he's holding a pen i got a metal mic in front of me
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:42.080]  i'm sitting on top of the chair um the idea of being a victim first and foremost is is
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:49.600]  your perspective on it's like being dead already yeah like you do not accept the circumstances
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:53.840]  around you've won you have to legally try to affect change so trying to go through the legal
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:59.200]  channels to make sure that you can get policy in place and power voters to try to get you know
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:04.080]  legislation that gets pushed through that you can carry but you know even in places where i can't
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:09.840]  carry there's nothing i can do about it the i'm going to be prepared as prepared can be in where i
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:13.600]  am you're going to look at because those are the target sounds these coward sick absolutely you
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:18.720]  know if i'm in a hospital and i can't have a gun or if i am you know an election center like you
[02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:22.400]  know i'm going to have a knife and you know that the people around me i'm going to have an escape
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:27.520]  plan but first and foremost i'm going to have an idea i'm going to have a perception on not being
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:30.960]  a prey i'm going to i'm going to be a predator i'm going to be standing there looking for that one
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:36.080]  guy that's nervous that's sweaty that's anxious that's kind of looking around no you you you
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:40.000]  you can push and the truth is that's just a normal instinct for a man especially to shift
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:45.680]  into that gear yeah you know what it is it should be that's not right now like i love that you're
[02:57:45.680 --> 02:57:48.880]  saying that you know like it should be a natural normal instinct for a guy to be able to do that
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:52.640]  when i walk out in the park with my kids i just especially i look around what's going on that's
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:57.840]  you you are rare you are one hundred i promise you you're like most people so in in my course i
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:02.640]  take guys to to a supermarket i say let's walk around this parking lot let's make some assumptions
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:08.320]  about what who drives this car is that person shoplifting and people for the first time i think
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:13.120]  in their lives go from looking at their phones or pushing their car or looking at their kids
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:17.680]  to bringing their head up and looking around and seeing a war around them and all of the threats
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:20.960]  that around them and they've just been ignorant their entire life it's rare that you have somebody
[02:58:20.960 --> 02:58:24.880]  like yourself that's going to go out and look and see what's there that's the start and that goes
[02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:28.880]  for politics too we're being overrun by tyranny because people are unconscious that was a great
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:32.560]  question we're going to come back with more questions with tim kemity fourth hour we got

[02:59:53.040 --> 03:00:05.680]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's
[03:00:05.680 --> 03:00:12.960]  a war on for your mind all right rob do's popping in at the eight after we're going to go to about
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:18.320]  15 after to take your phone calls we got tim kennedy here and uh he didn't want to brag about his
[03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:22.240]  exploits in his background all the rest of it uh but it is amazing in fact sometimes you got to
[03:00:22.240 --> 03:00:25.840]  come in because i know you've mentioned it i looked it up but i guess you were in some of the same
[03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:31.440]  operations he was an abc old you were in the army is one of their top snipers doing overwatch i guess
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:36.480]  he did nighttime you did daytime or vice vice versa but you chewed some of the same dirt uh as
[03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:44.560]  chris kyle yeah the uh you know the beginning of the war when when we after 9 11 um even you know i
[03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:50.480]  racked to um it was a very special forces special operations has grown dramatically in the past
[03:00:50.480 --> 03:00:57.680]  five eight years um 10 years ago the other there was not the same population of guys that could do
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:03.120]  what we do um so you you crossed you crossed a lot of paths you know like you only like one of the
[03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:07.760]  major roads through iraq at the time was called irish and um it was like the id central if you
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:12.800]  drove down that road you're going to get blown up so you'd have guys in 24 hours pretty much you'd
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:19.920]  put snipers in place to watch that road and try to um effectively protect the convoys by engaging
[03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:26.400]  on guys that were planting bombs um and anytime a convoy a combat operations would go into place
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:32.080]  that we would we would go onto the road to try to prevent people from planting bombs um you know so
[03:01:32.080 --> 03:01:36.960]  chris would you know sometimes be on this exact same road as i was um trying to do the same thing
[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:40.960]  that i was doing at the same place you know against the same dudes it was good though that guy was
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:47.200]  talented so you're saying from what you know that movie is pretty accurate it's a hollywood hollywood
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:52.000]  you know they're gonna they're gonna exaggerate certain elements um and then to fit an agenda
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:57.520]  they're gonna dilute certain things uh but that movie was close you know they did they did a great
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:02.720]  job really trying to understand the essence of what that job entails the sacrifice that takes
[03:02:02.720 --> 03:02:09.280]  both on a person so he was a super patriot and a great guy that guy um was an amazing human well
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:13.280]  there you go so i believe you uh because you say it because you've seen all the stuff the fights
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:17.040]  that have been out there and i've been neutral on the whole deal uh and when i was talking to chris
[03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:21.040]  call once before he died because i was also friends with jessia ventura i you know he was
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:25.760]  sounding pretty legitimate on the radio with me saying no you know that that stuff really happened
[03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:32.160]  very very sad that somebody with ptsd did that yeah i was actually just um a month ago on um
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:39.360]  danielosha's show with his with his widow and um she's a shooter too she's an amazing amazing patriot
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:46.640]  mrs kyle uh she can shoot better than i probably like 99.9 percent of the american population um

[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:01.600]  second amendment yeah i mean just so if you know if a guy like that is going to marry a woman like
[03:03:01.600 --> 03:03:06.960]  that um and do the things that he did and pull the triggers on the guys that he did um that is a
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:11.760]  badass that's a good dude yeah throw stones if you want but that's that's a great human what are the
[03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:19.200]  farthest shots you know and what's the best rifle at like super long distance uh i i love the 338
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:24.560]  lapua it's it's a very flat trajectory round um it's a fast traveling bullet the velocity the
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:29.760]  ballistics are good and that was call's favorite too right man i think guys that engage targets
[03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:33.920]  anywhere from thousand to two thousand meters um that's a money shotgun you know they they they're
[03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:40.560]  very confident in in the easy math that goes into wind adjustments and and bdc the bullet drop um it's

[03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:04.720]  that are that are that are running their mouths like you know i'm gonna go um you know to syria
[03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:09.760]  and do this to iraq to do that to afghanistan and do that but none of them have effectively um
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:17.600]  served a day in their life uh in in that capacity in that role you know left or right i have so so
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:21.280]  many issues with both candidates you're like um it looks like it's gonna be hillary and it's gonna
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:26.560]  be trump um how different are they you know like which one of them is gonna really gonna stand up
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:33.360]  and say okay this is america i'm gonna fight for it i believe in it um which one is the most honest
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:38.240]  and i i'm on the fence i love that finally we're at a place where people are talking about it or
[03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:43.120]  they're being powered they're being passionate um no you should not go into a highway and try to stand
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:46.800]  and prevent traffic from moving somebody that drives an american made vehicle like a jeep or
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:53.040]  a fort is gonna run you over so get off the road um but it's it's gonna be a crazy november it's
[03:04:53.040 --> 03:04:57.360]  gonna be crazy i agree when we know hillary's bad trump says a lot of good things the question is

[03:08:24.800 --> 03:08:30.800]  former and current military in special ops they're just all patriots i mean you like them on air
[03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:35.280]  you really want to know them off off air these guys are just amazing hadn't told me anything
[03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:39.520]  secret but you know i know a lot of stuff going on from all my sources and so it's just really really
[03:08:39.520 --> 03:08:43.920]  interesting to talk to these guys i want to go back to a few phone calls and hand the baton to rob
[03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:49.200]  do he may have some questions for you tim as well but specifically getting into hillary and trump
[03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:53.360]  you were going off on smiter in the break so i want to make clear though lesser of two evils you
[03:08:53.360 --> 03:08:56.960]  just don't want to go for that but your view of hillary clinton ben gazi and the rest of it
[03:08:58.320 --> 03:09:02.560]  you know the what i don't like about the election is that you're choosing the lesser of two evils
[03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:06.640]  you know and i'm not saying that trump's evil i don't know um i haven't been able to grasp with
[03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:11.200]  the substance of what he's saying is his reddicker has just kind of been a lot of pulp fiction a
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:17.200]  lot of pop and fuzz what i know is i hate hillar clinton i i you know but from ben gazi seen my
[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:21.600]  friends die and then lying about it saying it had to do with a video and then saying she lied about
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:25.520]  it being like just lie after lie after lie and she's a war hero like brian williams
[03:09:26.320 --> 03:09:32.000]  hey let me get off a helicopter under sniper fire do i as a dude that has been under lots of
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:35.600]  sniper fire um when you're coming out and she can hand some kissing babies and patting people on the
[03:09:35.600 --> 03:09:39.040]  top of the head that is not sniper fire sniper fire is when you are pushing your dick into the
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:43.440]  ground you're like trying to claw yourself inches into the ground just so you can get a little bit
[03:09:43.440 --> 03:09:49.200]  lower that's being under sniper fire so shut your line mouth and just be honest a couple of times
[03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:55.920]  um what i also don't understand is how when you have never owned a company in your life
[03:09:56.560 --> 03:10:02.080]  you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars you've never done anything besides serve the
[03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:06.320]  american people and you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars how does that make sense
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:12.320]  your secretary of state not only do so if you know if i was um in the japanese culture and i'm
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:18.080]  a leader of a group of people and then two of my employees went and got murdered by the people
[03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:21.920]  that i'm there supposed to be fighting i would have to take that samurai sword and fall on my
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:27.840]  sword to my death but now she's running for president after her support where did accountability go
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:33.920]  in this country or even just the actual amount of integrity not not only accountability but
[03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:39.760]  integrity she she she should have just said i'm done i have i have tried my hand at being a good
[03:10:39.760 --> 03:10:44.560]  civil servant i failed so now it's going to move on so not only did she get people killed but
[03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:50.400]  but she's worth hundreds of million dollars and she's never done anything besides worked for the
[03:10:50.400 --> 03:10:54.160]  american people you're not just a good super soldier who rewrote the book for the army in
[03:10:54.160 --> 03:10:58.320]  close quarters combat you're a really good talk show host in the patriot tim kennedy here i want
[03:10:58.320 --> 03:11:04.160]  to race through some calls now since this next caller wants to ask about uh ufc then we got special
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:07.680]  ops questions we're after runs with these fasts we're going to break in about nine minutes and
[03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:13.600]  do's taken over uh tim specifically uh you are mr clean you've been tested a lot by the anti doping
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:17.920]  group you even haven't tested for mainline supplements you take uh recently i guess you
[03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:22.640]  just got tested last week tell us about that well i think it tested once i think it tested twice um i
[03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:27.920]  got tested three times um blood urine in fact show us twitter folks or is it your your your
[03:11:27.920 --> 03:11:32.320]  instagram shows i'm taking the blood or whatever or yeah nurses coming in drawing blood from you
[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:37.680]  know both my arms and then the moment of the the inspectors arrive they are following me around
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:45.360]  everywhere i go and you know i haven't fought since usa da has come into effect with the with
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:50.000]  ultimate fighting and people like oh is that guy is because he's dirty listen man i'm getting tested
[03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:55.280]  more than anybody else in the ufc because you're mr clean because i i i have been very vocal well
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:58.720]  you said that one guy that kind of cheated or whatever like hidden the corner and barely
[03:11:58.720 --> 03:12:01.840]  beat you at the end you already kicked his ass you said i guarantee he's dirty and it turned out he
[03:12:01.840 --> 03:12:08.000]  was yeah so i'm not wrong very often so yo romeros who were specifically talking about i was like
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:11.280]  dude i promise you that guy is not only a cheater in the ring but he's a cheater outside of the
[03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:15.680]  ring and lo and behold he tested positive for anabolic steroids a very expensive boutique one
[03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:21.440]  but he and you know it's it's a rampant problem and you want him again but he won't do it right
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.840]  no well he won't he's going to be suspended forever that's what happens when you use
[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:31.280]  so he got tested and i haven't have they released the results yet one has yeah i'm always
[03:12:31.280 --> 03:12:34.800]  speaking it's not that you're on drugs it's that you're from krypton yeah i know i inject
[03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:43.360]  wolverine blood directly into my eyeball there is oh i tell you amazing so so i mean what is it
[03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:48.400]  just genetics and focus that you've gotten such good shape there's hard work uh yeah genetics
[03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:53.600]  focus but the biggest thing you know individual responsibility that's like one of the things
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:12:57.120]  that i really believe in that we're going to be talking about is you know being a libertarian is
[03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:02.880]  has individual responsibility and being a healthy hard work in person is very symbiotic in that way
[03:13:02.880 --> 03:13:08.400]  so i train my ass off you know i train two three times a day i'm told of these top gyms in austin
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:13.120]  i've been at some of them before you guys train double what anybody else does yeah absolutely you
[03:13:13.120 --> 03:13:16.080]  know we can walk into any of these gyms and they have you know like they have records up on the
[03:13:16.080 --> 03:13:20.240]  boards and they're saying like this is what tom he did last week with you know his movement in
[03:13:20.240 --> 03:13:26.320]  this particular exercise and like me and shane that's Aaron isn't it yeah well we'll walk in
[03:13:26.320 --> 03:13:29.520]  there be like all right what are your records right now so i can just go ahead and crush those
[03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:33.760]  and we can do that wherever we go i love going on and they have so many fantastic
[03:13:33.760 --> 03:13:39.360]  you're standing on a maniac dude he's just training freak he's powerful both his dad and
[03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:44.720]  his brother top rodeo uh bull riders yeah he has genetics too so don't don't think that like yes he
[03:13:44.720 --> 03:13:48.080]  works hard he trained he's only been doing it a few years he's already winning some big bounce
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:52.720]  i saw that one guy fought just last week was like twice as big as him he's good he's he's hard to
[03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:56.880]  submit he's very he's tough he's talented he's well he says you still throw him around like a radical
[03:13:56.880 --> 03:14:02.640]  uh this is a different level yeah as long as i don't let him get his hands on me he gets his hands
[03:14:02.640 --> 03:14:06.960]  on me just fly through the air he's very very talented yeah yeah so i guess in a few years
[03:14:06.960 --> 03:14:10.960]  he'll get better and better yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna start undermining um his training you know
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:16.880]  like i'm gonna start um stealing his mouthpiece and peeing in his cup make sure you work out
[03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:23.120]  sessions tim kennedy's our guest uh let's do the ufc question now andrew you're on the air thanks

[03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:34.640]  um i recently watched a video of phil oliver and andrew young they did an interview together where
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:39.200]  they talked about young jevities rebound and how lebron james stayed on his rebound and i was just
[03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:43.520]  wondering if mr kennedy if you've ever used uh rebound or any of the info wars products and if
[03:14:43.520 --> 03:14:47.040]  you'd be allowed to use those shares one of those is another product i wasn't gonna bring that up

[03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:58.080]  of them right now and it was a test you like i don't want to give uh away andrew you're not a
[03:14:58.080 --> 03:15:01.600]  plant caller because i specifically didn't want to get into this right now i want him on about all
[03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:08.240]  the cool stuff i know i am using it um but i'm doing uh a test we know i'm really evaluating
[03:15:08.240 --> 03:15:14.000]  the products that you guys have um i'm trying to do it very scientifically um and see both in great
[03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:21.200]  the growth speed power um you know with a strict diet i'm i'm yes i'm using that but i don't even
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:24.720]  know the answer yet because i want to hear after he's done it and andrew that is not a plant you
[03:15:24.720 --> 03:15:29.520]  said you were calling in about ufc question that is not a ufc question uh let's talk to mike
[03:15:30.160 --> 03:15:37.600]  to tim kennedy on special ops go ahead uh yeah mr kennedy i was wondering uh how many uh former
[03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:44.880]  special ops are working for the feds in the government uh is there a high percentage i think
[03:15:44.880 --> 03:15:52.720]  that's classified but go ahead a lot you know the um you can't really separate them when the
[03:15:52.720 --> 03:15:57.840]  military is the federal government um yes we're supposed to be working overseas and not in the
[03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:03.360]  united states but as the wars are dwindling down and we're doing less in iraq and afghanistan you
[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:07.840]  have a huge population very talented warfighter special operations guys that are coming back
[03:16:07.840 --> 03:16:13.360]  and looking for jobs it's a very very quick and easy transfer almost and they are smart to want
[03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:18.240]  people like that yeah okay i mean we're like this is the best population of the hardworking
[03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:22.640]  trained guys on the planet so whether you're going to fbi or going to cia or you're going to
[03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:26.800]  your local police department you know you can come to austin or houston or san Antonio and i know
[03:16:26.800 --> 03:16:31.200]  guys that i deployed with that are working there now that are you know heading up the swat so
[03:16:31.200 --> 03:16:35.840]  there's a lot of them um it's not like some orchestrated design it's uh these guys are
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:40.560]  coming back and they need jobs and these are great jobs for them and and it's a great opportunity
[03:16:40.560 --> 03:16:45.600]  for these federal agents or agencies to grab fantastic talented trained people they just
[03:16:45.600 --> 03:16:50.080]  better not follow orders to shoot on armed farmers i know that's a bad idea all right thank you for
[03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:54.000]  the call mike let's talk to dan and oregon speaking of where this went down go ahead dan you're on
[03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:58.480]  the air hey alec thanks so much for taking my call and for everything you do love the show
[03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:03.840]  thank you brother go ahead and tim thanks for you for protecting america and i'll let you do
[03:17:05.040 --> 03:17:09.200]  real quick on the organ thing not my question but lavoix finnequim and his uh in amon bundy
[03:17:09.200 --> 03:17:13.600]  and those guys were on their way to a town meeting with the sheriff with over 400 people probably to
[03:17:13.600 --> 03:17:18.640]  talk about what was going on so that was definitely an assassination by the fbi in my opinion um so
[03:17:18.640 --> 03:17:21.760]  what i want to say about isis everything that happened today we know alex that we're dealing
[03:17:21.760 --> 03:17:25.840]  with a spiritual war here right uh it's a spiritual war that we're trying to attack
[03:17:25.840 --> 03:17:29.600]  with things that happened today though it does get manifested in the physical realm
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:34.720]  so as americans on the government level on the high fed level how do we attack that and again on
[03:17:34.720 --> 03:17:39.360]  the personal level like individuals us here how do we how do we attack that without again being
[03:17:39.360 --> 03:17:43.360]  labeled islamophobia and you think look i mean here's a lot of some muslims that aren't murdering
[03:17:43.360 --> 03:17:48.160]  killers okay but they're bringing a man islam's being radicalized worldwide saudi arabia is
[03:17:48.160 --> 03:17:52.960]  invading everywhere putting their people in and it's just survival uh so i mean look this is
[03:17:52.960 --> 03:17:56.960]  who's killing us this is who's attacking us i don't care if you call me islamophobic i don't
[03:17:56.960 --> 03:18:01.040]  care if you lie about me and say i'm racist because i don't want obama here sorry i'm ranting
[03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:07.760]  no you're not you're you're you're spot on we have to win the propaganda war the uh like palestine
[03:18:07.760 --> 03:18:12.000]  and israel palestine has been beating israel every single turn where they'll go and put a mortar
[03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:17.200]  in a hospital and then mortar so regardless if israel responds or they don't um hopefully that
[03:18:17.200 --> 03:18:22.480]  they do so if they kill some israelis by sending mortars from this hospital and then israel responds
[03:18:22.480 --> 03:18:26.720]  and then destroys the hospital they're now one they got they not only hurt israelis by the
[03:18:26.720 --> 03:18:31.760]  mortaring but then they hurt um the israelis on the propaganda battle by then having the
[03:18:31.760 --> 03:18:36.400]  hospital destroyed we have to get ahead of them in the propaganda battle we have to attack and
[03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:40.160]  understand their ideology and how they're going about it how they're radicalizing these people
[03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:44.720]  how they're recruiting people you know when they're going for low socioeconomic economic groups of
[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:50.080]  people the uneducated we need to break them for that we need to say look stop being victims and
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:54.080]  understand that these guys are going specifically for the poor and the uninformed so if you're
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:58.400]  going to stand up for the weak if you're going to stand up for the sheep recognize that the isis
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:02.560]  and and the like are going after the weakest people on the planet not only to recruit them
[03:19:02.560 --> 03:19:06.320]  and then murder them but then to ultimately try to commit terrorist action thank you dan great
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:09.520]  question only one or two more calls we're gonna hand it to rob do i'm skipping this break here's
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:13.680]  my issue i had colonel schaefer on about this who ran the stratos ivy and uh you know all the rest
[03:19:13.680 --> 03:19:17.520]  of the operations they could have killed bin latin twice with operators like you guys they were
[03:19:17.520 --> 03:19:22.480]  ordered to stand down by the cia and then we see countless examples where they won't let them take
[03:19:22.480 --> 03:19:26.480]  out the leadership uh now i know that's changing but isn't the answer i know that's one of your
[03:19:26.480 --> 03:19:32.560]  specialties you can't talk about it isn't it take out the leadership yeah the obviously the best
[03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:37.920]  thing to do is you have to be able to take out the leadership without um immortalizing them you
[03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:44.320]  know had you killed bin latin in at certain times he would have been then the flagship for
[03:19:44.320 --> 03:19:50.400]  martyrdom for that religion for the next 50 years you know had given them the body or killing them
[03:19:50.400 --> 03:19:54.880]  dropping them um a bomb from a drone and they recovered that body that would have been theirs
[03:19:54.880 --> 03:19:58.080]  they would have built a shrine and people would have gone and worshiped him you know that's why
[03:19:58.080 --> 03:20:00.720]  we had to do it the way that we did where we went and snagged them after we killed him
[03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:04.800]  and then he just disappeared so you do think that that obama raiden all that what was real
[03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:11.840]  and no hanging thank you um i know the guys that went to do it and they're guys like me um sure i
[03:20:11.840 --> 03:20:15.280]  know it's just you know the kind of the some of the seals got blown up in the helicopter and the
[03:20:15.280 --> 03:20:21.280]  rest of it and then they said it was a little suspicious it was um i'll take your word for it
[03:20:21.280 --> 03:20:24.960]  i'm you can't take because i wasn't there i'm seeing that the guys that would go to do that and
[03:20:24.960 --> 03:20:29.680]  the guys that were there um those are shooters those are guys that are good at really one thing
[03:20:29.680 --> 03:20:34.320]  that's killing people so you don't send guys like that into pakistan to do anything else but that
[03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:39.440]  sure it's just that you know i don't know then they're packing on helicopter a month later
[03:20:39.440 --> 03:20:42.160]  they all thought it was a setup i've talked to some of their families and it blows up
[03:20:42.960 --> 03:20:46.800]  very very suspicious and you know it just shows how they're trying to i mean this is
[03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:50.480]  why the army smart not allowing themselves to be politicized and i know you love the name
[03:20:50.480 --> 03:20:55.760]  seals as well but what about that split uh where where more and more the seals are ordered to be
[03:20:55.760 --> 03:21:01.920]  involved in political stuff i don't understand it um you know our motto is the quiet professionals
[03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:08.240]  you know we're supposed to be the guys that can do our job and we're not going to be uh
[03:21:08.240 --> 03:21:11.600]  scrutinized because there's no opportunity to attack us because we're not saying anything we're
[03:21:11.600 --> 03:21:15.440]  going to go the best way that you would i could ever do a job as i go and i do it i complete the
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:20.640]  mission and then you never hear about it um that's it that's a job well done if i'm going on and i'm
[03:21:20.640 --> 03:21:24.400]  writing a book or i'm saying hey i did this or i did that let me make a movie about it let me do
[03:21:24.400 --> 03:21:30.800]  a tv show about it nah man you you maybe need to get into a different field so it's it's that also
[03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:36.480]  makes you a target later absolutely um so it's scary i don't know i don't there there is a shift
[03:21:36.480 --> 03:21:41.840]  right now where they're kind of allowing or even encouraging people to do um more public activities
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:47.440]  uh which i don't understand so you're not doing it um i'm always i'm i can't shut me up you're
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:51.280]  talking about freedom in general you're not talking about operations no no you're not gonna
[03:21:51.280 --> 03:21:56.160]  like i'm vague and ambiguous here i am always when i'm talking about you know things i've done
[03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:01.440]  previously uh but right now uh you know you can't shut me up when it when it comes to freedom
[03:22:02.240 --> 03:22:06.160]  but well i can't even get into it it's all very very interesting obviously all i know is just
[03:22:06.160 --> 03:22:11.040]  the opposite of what these universities are producing with these leftist i'm not even attacking
[03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:16.000]  leftists but they are so soft so dumb down so disconnected from reality compared to people
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:19.920]  that actually go out and do something it's amazing i want to go to all these other calls but i want
[03:22:19.920 --> 03:22:27.040]  to um i want to be able to also hand this over to rob do uh and get to some of the other points
[03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:31.360]  but uh sorry to their callers rob do will be able to go to you i wanted to bring rob do in who's
[03:22:31.360 --> 03:22:36.240]  co-hosting this fourth hour today uh and have him with one question for tim kennedy and i'm gonna
[03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:43.200]  hand the baton to rob do uh go ahead rob sure hey tim there was a an isis attack on about 200 marines
[03:22:43.200 --> 03:22:48.160]  i believe it was in our wreck just recently and they ended up killing a staff sergeant louise
[03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:53.120]  cardin and uh do what do you know about that do you know how isis got that intelligence because
[03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:59.760]  people are kind of unsure of how that went down uh i i don't know a lot of the details my understanding
[03:22:59.760 --> 03:23:08.880]  is that it was at a ford operating base and that it's not a hard uh it's not easy um to
[03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:16.320]  hide where you are when you're a bunch of marines your 200 marines in iraq um a ford operating
[03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:22.320]  base it's very uh recognizable identifiable so they figured out where they were and then
[03:23:22.320 --> 03:23:30.400]  there was a rocket attack that was coordinated with some small arms fire pretty pretty basic uh pathetic
[03:23:30.400 --> 03:23:35.040]  level attack so that's just the idiocy by the daily beast acting like isis knew just where to hit
[03:23:35.040 --> 03:23:40.640]  these marines supposedly in a secret base no it's not hard it it's not hard to find out where we
[03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:45.280]  like even special operations like we try so hard to to be able to blend in and disappear you like
[03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:51.280]  we're like a bunch of ninjas um in camouflage like let's be realistic the moment that we land
[03:23:51.280 --> 03:23:54.960]  they know that we're there and we have we have to recognize that we have to be aware of that
[03:23:55.760 --> 03:23:59.600]  they're very good they have 13 year olds with cell phones walking around following us everywhere we
[03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:06.880]  go uh so we we take that and everything um with our secrecy with a grand assault we we make a lot
[03:24:06.880 --> 03:24:11.600]  of effort to try to to hide what we're doing and how we do things but ultimately we're being watched
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:16.640]  24 seven so like they didn't have some inside informant that told them where the marines were
[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:20.560]  pretty much it was just a bunch of dudes with cell phones being like hey we got 200 marines here
[03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:25.520]  let's uh walk off uh and get some gps coordinates about how to drop some some rock sure i don't
[03:24:25.520 --> 03:24:28.880]  get that daily beast articles i've been in the military but i know those bases just stick out
[03:24:28.880 --> 03:24:32.480]  like sore thumbs everybody knows where they are all right well tim kennedy thank you so much we're

[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:07.920]  we got some video that will be here in the next few days as well the nightly news uh over to you
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:11.840]  and all the latest breaking news and of course the big terror attacks that happened in belgium
[03:25:11.840 --> 03:25:18.240]  that are being blamed on donald trump right now robbed it that's right everything is donald trump's
[03:25:18.240 --> 03:25:22.560]  fault um ted cruz came out and said i'm going to play that clip i'm also going to play some old
[03:25:22.560 --> 03:25:27.920]  clips from donald trump saying brussels uh is a is a hellhole essentially uh with what's going on
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:32.240]  there and then we're going to look at a clip from jimmy carter the jimmy carter administration
[03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:38.320]  during the iran hostage crisis where he banned iranians from coming into the country and you
[03:25:38.320 --> 03:25:43.680]  know nobody said anything nobody called him a racist then uh there was no outcry it was just
[03:25:43.680 --> 03:25:48.640]  well that's what you do when you're at war with a group of people but first let's look at this
[03:25:48.640 --> 03:25:55.280]  article obama trolled over brussels attacks after calling global warming greatest threat to humanity
[03:25:55.280 --> 03:25:59.920]  even though we know it's not global warming anymore it's uh cooling we've been in a 13 year
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:05.280]  cooling cycle but don't tell the uh the guys that know who've been faking the the data for years
[03:26:05.280 --> 03:26:10.080]  uh no challenge poses at a greater threat to future generations than climate change and here's
[03:26:10.080 --> 03:26:15.280]  a sound that people respond to back climate change is rare to suddenly head in brussels amazing
[03:26:15.280 --> 03:26:20.320]  insanity breaking climate change just claim responsibility for attacks in brussels killing
[03:26:20.320 --> 03:26:26.800]  30 climate change strikes again yo obama fly the family over to brussels and explain how climate
[03:26:26.800 --> 03:26:31.360]  change is the biggest threat well someone please ask the people brussels how much climate change
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:35.680]  affected what happened this morning if your elected officials think climate change is a
[03:26:35.680 --> 03:26:41.440]  bigger threat than or bigger problem than terrorism unelect them so that's just some of the of them
[03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:47.280]  and then i love this uh cartoon from ben garrison's got terrorism and obama wearing the same turban
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:53.120]  so uh there'll be that but let's go to that first video with donald trump saying brussels
[03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:59.920]  is like living in a hellhole he said this back in 2012 this more person i bring people together
[03:26:59.920 --> 03:27:03.680]  or you couldn't build a great company you don't think you've alienated people i mean come on you
[03:27:03.680 --> 03:27:07.920]  don't think you've alienated but ultimately i bring them together and i'll tell you what i tell the
[03:27:07.920 --> 03:27:14.320]  truth whether it was with respect to the muslims hey maria there's something going on and we have a
[03:27:14.320 --> 03:27:19.760]  president that doesn't want to even talk about radical islamic terrorism i bring people together
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:25.680]  i've had muslims call me up and say thank you because they need dialogue i bring people together
[03:27:25.680 --> 03:27:31.440]  obama has been the great divider to be fair on the muslim comments i mean we do admit a hundred
[03:27:31.440 --> 03:27:36.480]  thousand muslims on a permanent basis here every year and this is going to be the large or is already
[03:27:36.480 --> 03:27:42.160]  the largest religion in the world can you really say let's do a temporary halt there's something
[03:27:42.160 --> 03:27:49.040]  going on maria go to brussels go to paris go to different places there's something going on and
[03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:54.400]  it's not good where they want your real law where they want this where they want things that you know
[03:27:54.400 --> 03:27:59.440]  there has to be some assimilation there is no assimilation there's something bad going on and
[03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:04.880]  until we find out what it is so we can correct it you go to brussels i was in brussels a long time
[03:28:04.880 --> 03:28:10.640]  ago 20 years ago so beautiful everything's so beautiful it's like living in a hell hole right
[03:28:10.640 --> 03:28:17.760]  now you go to these different places there's something going on to quote spinal tap living in
[03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:24.800]  a hell hole now let's go to ted cruz who basically came out on the tarmac today and said you know a
[03:28:24.800 --> 03:28:28.720]  day after trump says we got to get out of nato he also says some things about the un and that
[03:28:28.720 --> 03:28:34.160]  they're ineffectual oh there's a terrorist attack so kind of putting two and two together definitely
[03:28:34.160 --> 03:28:44.160]  a jab in his direction let's play that video well i will say it is striking that the day after
[03:28:44.160 --> 03:28:50.560]  donald trump called for america weakening nato withdrawing from nato we see
[03:28:53.440 --> 03:28:59.920]  brussels where nato is headquartered the subject of a radical islamic terrorist attack
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:06.480]  there you go and now let's go to trump's response to brussels he just said this uh this morning here
[03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:11.840]  it is we have to be very careful in the united states we have to be very very vigilant as to who
[03:29:11.840 --> 03:29:17.360]  we allow it to this country if you do become president and we're in a situation like this

[03:34:11.280 --> 03:34:14.960]  things in the future i don't know if that's true or not but that's ridiculous if that's
[03:34:14.960 --> 03:34:19.280]  what's happening of course you're not supposed to speak out we're just supposed to let more and
[03:34:19.280 --> 03:34:24.160]  more and that's why they're having these problems in brussels in france because they don't speak out
[03:34:24.160 --> 03:34:29.200]  and they leave their doors wide open to anybody who wants to come in and they don't properly vet
[03:34:29.200 --> 03:34:35.280]  these people in fact joe biggs michael zimmerman and paul joseph watson took a train from brussels
[03:34:35.280 --> 03:34:40.800]  to france didn't even have to go through a border checkpoint it's wide open hey come on in and that's
[03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:45.120]  where the attackers originated from paris they originated from brussels right now we're running

[03:35:45.280 --> 03:35:50.160]  so i was covering this article right before we went to break of the number of immigrants from
[03:35:50.160 --> 03:35:55.040]  muslim nations that we're going to be bringing in and there's a graph if you guys can scroll down
[03:35:55.040 --> 03:35:59.840]  to that graph that shows how many they've issued over the last five years you've got to come muslims
[03:35:59.840 --> 03:36:06.800]  coming in from afghanistan sudan syria indonesia yemen lebanon algeria jordan mexico turkey
[03:36:06.800 --> 03:36:14.880]  usbekistan simalia egypt iran bangladesh iraq and pakistan have the most along with um bangladesh
[03:36:14.880 --> 03:36:22.640]  and iran so we're bringing in lots of people from these countries and i would say most of them
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:28.480]  probably are coming here for a good life and that's how it used to be when we had immigration and
[03:36:28.480 --> 03:36:32.160]  people were immigrating to this country they were coming here looking for a better life they weren't
[03:36:32.160 --> 03:36:36.400]  coming here looking to tear down the united states or turn it into a different nation they were
[03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:40.720]  coming here to be part of what was going on which was a free market society where if you
[03:36:40.720 --> 03:36:46.160]  worked your butt off you can make something of yourself but uh now we have cuban refugees flocking
[03:36:46.160 --> 03:36:53.760]  to the texas border here's another article from october 2015 to february 2016 more than 18500 cubans
[03:36:53.760 --> 03:36:59.520]  arrived at texas laredo field office of the us customers border patrol so that includes del rio
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:04.880]  and brownsville and uh if the trend continues it will shatter last year's numbers for the same ports
[03:37:04.880 --> 03:37:11.440]  when a record 28 000 cross so they just keep upping the records and that's just from cuba
[03:37:11.440 --> 03:37:17.360]  that doesn't count the other central american the uh african or the middle eastern countries
[03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:21.600]  that people are coming from now i want to go to this video of jimmy carter during the
[03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:27.280]  iran hostage crisis well they put a lot of sanctions on iran and they also uh banned
[03:37:27.280 --> 03:37:31.360]  iranians from coming into the country and asked the diplomats to leave and nobody called him a
[03:37:31.360 --> 03:37:37.200]  racist so what's the difference now why is donald being called a racist i've got video coming up
[03:37:37.200 --> 03:37:42.480]  of young children who have been brainwashed by their parents um into believing everything they see
[03:37:42.480 --> 03:37:46.400]  on cnn and other mainstream media outlets so let's go to that video jimmy carter first
[03:37:46.400 --> 03:37:51.440]  how the president ordered four steps immediately a complete break in diplomatic relations iranian
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:56.400]  diplomats must leave the united states by tomorrow midnight official sanctions prohibiting exports
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:38:02.320]  to iran the exporting of even food and medicine is expected to be minimal or nonexistent an inventory
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:06.640]  of frozen iranian assets of over eight billion dollars in this country and steps toward using
[03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:11.920]  the money to pay claims of americans against iran and a virtual shutting off of all iranian
[03:38:11.920 --> 03:38:17.200]  immigration into this country by refusing new visas to iranian citizens moreover the president
[03:38:17.200 --> 03:38:23.680]  warned these four steps may be just the beginning the steps i have ordered today are those that
[03:38:23.680 --> 03:38:33.280]  are necessary now other action may become necessary if these steps do not produce the
[03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:42.960]  prompt release of the hostages there you go hey let's go to a call chris in ohio comment on the
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:47.440]  nationwide hate for trump i don't know if it's nationwide hate i think it's a very vocal minority
[03:38:47.440 --> 03:38:51.760]  that's being coerced into hate and i've got a video showing that in a second but go ahead
[03:38:51.760 --> 03:38:58.480]  what do you have to say interesting is actually i know uh one of the guys that provoked this viral
[03:38:58.480 --> 03:39:04.400]  video in in cleveland where someone says something about go back to ashowitz will obviously someone
[03:39:04.400 --> 03:39:09.760]  called the guy not but then that i don't know if you saw that video or not and okay so that's one
[03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:15.520]  thing but to me i can't even enjoy logging on facebook anymore because literally the whole thing is
[03:39:15.520 --> 03:39:22.960]  hate hate hate and and just it's very and hate of trump is okay on facebook right you notice
[03:39:22.960 --> 03:39:28.880]  hate of trump is okay if you say anything else if you have an opinion that's negative of anybody else
[03:39:28.880 --> 03:39:35.840]  you're censored on facebook right and um you know i mean it's just a shame that all these people
[03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:39.520]  are showing their worst sides and also i'm a veteran i was over there the same time as uh
[03:39:39.520 --> 03:39:47.200]  uh tim and our job is finding bombs and building fortifications and yeah i i love the people when
[03:39:47.200 --> 03:39:51.760]  they're children they're very great people but you know people got over here have to understand
[03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:57.760]  too our military worked alongside the iraqi army and good afghanistan people to fight people don't
[03:39:57.760 --> 03:40:02.560]  even get that they think as soon as you say oh i'm against these terrorists they think you're
[03:40:02.560 --> 03:40:08.720]  against all and that's not the case right you know i think the the argument though is you know
[03:40:08.720 --> 03:40:13.600]  if if people if people were to invade our country say china was to invade our country and they had
[03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:18.480]  taken over a large swath of it and americans started fighting the chinese we would be called
[03:40:18.480 --> 03:40:25.760]  terrorists and insurgents you realize that right right i mean and that's you know because whoever
[03:40:25.760 --> 03:40:30.880]  is controlling the narrative is going to call you you know whatever you want and and you know going
[03:40:30.880 --> 03:40:37.600]  the those wars were both i think fought on on bad bad terms and for bad reasons and uh and not we
[03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:41.600]  weren't on the up and up and i don't think we were in danger being attacked by afghanistan or iraq
[03:40:42.800 --> 03:40:48.480]  you know at that time and even still to this day the the the people that went there the family
[03:40:48.480 --> 03:40:53.120]  men the people that were sensitive to their culture i mean you can't you can't talk about
[03:40:53.120 --> 03:40:57.040]  there's nobody better i mean we we gave them food hug them there i got really great pictures of me
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:01.600]  hugging these kids and like once people over here aren't used to deception they're not used to this
[03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:08.160]  so they think every person from the middle east is like you know they're all mystical or something
[03:41:08.160 --> 03:41:12.400]  it's like no man they're they got their psychos too they're yeah they're regular people most of them
[03:41:12.400 --> 03:41:16.320]  are regular people to fight them right like people though i guess what i'm saying is people here don't
[03:41:16.320 --> 03:41:20.480]  get i have a higher love because i've been on my knees for these people i've uplifted these people
[03:41:20.480 --> 03:41:25.360]  and they're going to tell me oh you know and put female american veterans at risk i mean this is
[03:41:25.360 --> 03:41:30.880]  going by the model of europe you know that also bothers me i mean we have female veterans here
[03:41:30.880 --> 03:41:35.680]  they're indiscriminately attacking women this is very ridiculous yeah totally agree thanks for the
[03:41:35.680 --> 03:41:40.880]  call hey let's go down to this video it's called on video brainwashed children if you saw uh there's

[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:01.200]  see a problem of bringing kids to a protest either for or against trump i mean you're you're teaching
[03:45:01.200 --> 03:45:05.920]  kids to get active i think when you're telling kids uh the same you're propagating the same lives that
[03:45:05.920 --> 03:45:10.160]  you see in the mainstream media you're doing your kids a disservice but that's just my opinion
[03:45:10.160 --> 03:45:14.640]  let's talk to courtney and femur region six wants to talk about the double standard everyone hating
[03:45:14.640 --> 03:45:21.120]  on trump go ahead courtney hi i just wanted to call and comment and like one of the guys
[03:45:21.120 --> 03:45:26.080]  was saying earlier that was talking about going on facebook um it actually kind of changed
[03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:33.680]  changed my comment that i'm gonna say um i actually was personally attacked on facebook
[03:45:33.680 --> 03:45:43.760]  for posting a supportive donald trump post um i my husband served in iraq and afghanistan
[03:45:43.760 --> 03:45:55.280]  he is um he has a purple heart he is a disabled veteran from the army and um and he personally
[03:45:55.280 --> 03:46:02.800]  a this this friend that i thought i had um he personally attacked me he said that my husband
[03:46:02.800 --> 03:46:10.000]  was not a hero my husband was a coward and some words that i can't say on air because like
[03:46:10.000 --> 03:46:17.360]  gaelic says it's a family show right and you know and and it's gotten to be just not fun anymore
[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:26.160]  like facebook has turned into this um this war zone it's fulfilling its mission it's fulfilling
[03:46:26.160 --> 03:46:32.400]  its mission to tell us how to think what to say and if you say something wrong the uh henpeckers
[03:46:32.400 --> 03:46:36.400]  will come and tell you that you're wrong so you were physically attacked by someone or just attacked
[03:46:36.400 --> 03:46:43.120]  through facebook i was attacked through facebook from a friend that i had um that we've been friends
[03:46:43.120 --> 03:46:49.680]  for five or six years and then all of a sudden he just starts attacking me and my family and
[03:46:49.680 --> 03:46:55.280]  and everything that i believe in and it's like it's it's gotten to a point where it's gotten
[03:46:55.280 --> 03:47:00.320]  ridiculous and we've got to stop and realize that at the end of the day we're all americans and
[03:47:00.320 --> 03:47:05.680]  guess what when the terrorists who are attacking people like they attack the people in brussels
[03:47:05.680 --> 03:47:09.840]  today guess what at the end of the day we're all going to be americans and we're all going to need
[03:47:09.840 --> 03:47:17.040]  to take the stand together against these people who want to hurt us and when you have that out there
[03:47:17.520 --> 03:47:23.280]  you have to realize that and you have to get grounded and stop this just knifing back and
[03:47:23.280 --> 03:47:30.560]  back and forth each other and hearing those kids breaks my heart it just breaks my heart because it
[03:47:30.560 --> 03:47:38.720]  because that's our future yeah and we're turning our kids into into snipy aggressive i mean what
[03:47:38.720 --> 03:47:44.640]  two little kids use the term racist and they're being trained they're being trained at a young age
[03:47:44.640 --> 03:47:51.520]  now to be little henpeckers and to find people who are not holding the party line and correct them
[03:47:51.520 --> 03:47:57.680]  and that is exactly what is going on and regurgitating mainstream media talking points
[03:47:57.680 --> 03:48:03.280]  it's disgusting but you know that's uh that's their right to do with their kids you know unfortunately
[03:48:03.280 --> 03:48:07.520]  i don't think it's right but thanks for calling courtney let's go to gary in arizona wants to
[03:48:07.520 --> 03:48:12.240]  talk about the bin laden raid that was pretty interesting uh tim thinks it was uh i think it
[03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:15.760]  was a real raid i just don't think they killed bin laden personally i don't i don't think that
[03:48:15.760 --> 03:48:21.360]  was bin laden i think it was just some old guy he was set up but go ahead gary first
[03:48:21.360 --> 03:48:28.240]  of all i have the greatest respect for alex i mean uh in my book he's the best okay he's a general
[03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:34.320]  and i and i know that he is isn't there to speak for himself but i do want to say this
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:41.600]  um you know he's he's shouting from the mountaintops and i say this with with due respect to him
[03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:48.160]  because um i cannot tell you how i like the guy i mean i really can't say enough good about him
[03:48:48.160 --> 03:48:53.120]  and what he's done but he shouts from the mount mountaintops about the bin laden raid
[03:48:53.760 --> 03:49:01.200]  then when he gets a mercenary and i believe this guy is a mercenary uh on he just clams up he just
[03:49:01.200 --> 03:49:07.280]  lets him go he just you know i mean he just he just like a puppy dog i don't understand that
[03:49:07.280 --> 03:49:12.560]  now the other thing i wanted to mention rob um by the way you do a really good everybody there
[03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:18.240]  does a great job i mean i i can't tell you i can't compliment you enough and by the way your products
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:29.600]  are terrific um but but i will say this he said that a lot of these um i call mercenaries um because
[03:49:29.600 --> 03:49:34.640]  if you're in a war and you're not in a war to win it then what are those people who what would you
[03:49:34.640 --> 03:49:41.680]  call the people fighting those wars um i mean you know the second world war i mean were there any
[03:49:41.680 --> 03:49:45.520]  mercenaries in the second world war no we were there to win it i don't think we were there to win
[03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:50.160]  Vietnam i don't think we were there to win korea you know i think those guys were just brought in
[03:49:50.160 --> 03:49:56.640]  to show um to create a scene and and you know make profits for the military industrial complex i
[03:49:56.640 --> 03:50:01.440]  think that's what is going on in the background and i think a lot of these guys don't know that
[03:50:01.440 --> 03:50:05.680]  you know they're not they're not at that level they're not they're not seeing the benefits of
[03:50:05.680 --> 03:50:11.280]  these contracts and you know these multi-year no bid contracts a lot of the guys on the ground
[03:50:11.280 --> 03:50:16.320]  like the lady who just called Courtney her husband he probably is you know a probably a great guy
[03:50:16.320 --> 03:50:19.840]  you know he didn't know what was going on and how these things are fought and why they're
[03:50:19.840 --> 03:50:24.800]  fought you know he's just doing his duty because he's you know told that being a soldier is you
[03:50:24.800 --> 03:50:30.640]  know following orders and going to do into these combat zones but the only thing i wanted to say
[03:50:30.640 --> 03:50:36.800]  was this yeah i don't i do not mean to be respectful disrespectful to any of the military because
[03:50:36.800 --> 03:50:42.240]  again i'm i'm certainly for them i was in the military myself i wouldn't be disrespectful
[03:50:42.240 --> 03:50:46.800]  towards him but they're being treated like mercenaries now these fellows that hey let's

[03:54:37.680 --> 03:54:41.760]  how the military it looks seems like the current military to you are more mercenaries than they
[03:54:41.760 --> 03:54:46.880]  are freedom fighters i'll say this the military does have a hard job and those guys a lot of
[03:54:46.880 --> 03:54:51.600]  those guys are very awake and i think you're going to find that more than the average uh
[03:54:51.600 --> 03:54:57.120]  you know bernie sanders voter but go ahead i understand that completely and believe me
[03:54:57.120 --> 03:55:03.440]  i do not mean any disrespect towards the fellows that go ahead and and um devote themselves to the
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:09.440]  to to the military in this country so don't misunderstand me but i'm trying to make some
[03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:15.120]  fat points and state some facts now he said these fellows come back from the military
[03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:20.000]  and the first thing they do looking for work the first thing they do is get you hooked up with the
[03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:26.400]  feds okay now what does that mean that means exactly what happened in oregon that's what
[03:55:26.400 --> 03:55:32.560]  that means shoot first ask questions later now i don't know who those guys were that killed the boy
[03:55:33.360 --> 03:55:37.360]  but and we still don't have their names and we should we should have their names
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:43.200]  but i don't know who they were whether they were ex-military or what but if if they're recruiting
[03:55:43.760 --> 03:55:52.080]  ex-military into the into the fbi or any other law enforcement operation that goes right along
[03:55:52.080 --> 03:55:57.920]  with alex always says and they're they're militarizing purposely militarizing the police forces in
[03:55:57.920 --> 03:56:02.800]  this country well that's what happens to a lot of police local police departments that you know
[03:56:02.800 --> 03:56:07.360]  they hire ex-military you know one the guys know how to shoot a weapon to they know how to follow
[03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:15.120]  orders three they're pretty physical but they're in areas where their life was under constant
[03:56:15.120 --> 03:56:19.120]  threat and then you still have that i think hanging over on them when they're coming back
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:25.120]  they're they're thinking you know everybody's okay who knows what they're thinking i'm you know i
[03:56:25.120 --> 03:56:30.480]  joe biggs is back from military and and uh he's he's a pretty stable guy although he does he does
[03:56:30.480 --> 03:56:35.200]  like to uh have a drink of fireball every now and then but he's a he's a great guy and he's
[03:56:35.200 --> 03:56:41.760]  he's been in the thick of it in afghanistan and iraq so hey gary thanks for calling i uh i agree
[03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:46.800]  with you on a lot of those points i want to play just a part of a video yesterday david night was
[03:56:46.800 --> 03:56:51.280]  in front of the apat conference and uh he was going up to talk to a guy with a trump is a
[03:56:51.280 --> 03:56:56.960]  nazi sign and lo and behold who pops up out of the woodwork from under his pot of gold but
[03:56:56.960 --> 03:57:03.440]  to wevster tarpley so let's uh let's play that video till we i guess in the show we're in a point
[03:57:03.440 --> 03:57:09.040]  we're in a historical tipping point buddy yeah we gotta tell it like okay so you think you think
[03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:14.480]  trump is a nazi you think this gets your message you do you do okay he's nazi yeah violence in
[03:57:14.480 --> 03:57:20.960]  israeli you compare him to the the hitler of 1929 you compare him to the musolini of 1920
[03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:26.240]  you don't think that's an overstatement no i'm a historian i know what i'm talking about
[03:57:26.240 --> 03:57:31.200]  there are multiple points and your webster tarpley right we're totally that's it we've got webster
[03:57:31.200 --> 03:57:36.800]  tarpley here and webster tarpley thinks that donald trump is a nazi so loopy a nazi and i'm
[03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:41.920]  i'm back that up beyond goodwin all to see libertarians who were supposed to be the opposite of
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:47.920]  authoritarian totalitarian all trooping like lemmings into this trump conveyance let's talk
[03:57:47.920 --> 03:57:52.400]  about some people who called themselves libertarians never would have supported we should all be
[03:57:52.400 --> 03:57:56.880]  supporting hillary clinton right western do you think at least from my experience okay do you
[03:57:56.880 --> 03:58:00.800]  understand what's going on with globalism do you see that the open borders and they mostly
[03:58:00.800 --> 03:58:07.120]  work with the libertarians and the libertarians i used to work with never ever would have endorsed
