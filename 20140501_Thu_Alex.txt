[00:00.000 --> 00:23.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:23.960 --> 00:32.120]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[00:32.120 --> 00:36.760]  take me through the center is to supersonic
[00:52.760 --> 00:58.360]  Monday through Friday ladies and gentlemen 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. central
[00:58.360 --> 01:03.720]  standard time we're here i am your host alex jones and there is just a mass ton
[01:03.720 --> 01:09.520]  of news here today that i've somehow got to get to i have told you for at least
[01:09.520 --> 01:16.560]  12 years that the internal border patrol homeland security checkpoints 100
[01:16.560 --> 01:22.560]  miles into the nation are to be set up to be the beginning of a national internal
[01:22.560 --> 01:29.520]  police force that's what mcclatchy is now calling it today in an article titled
[01:29.520 --> 01:35.760]  as border security expands complaints of abuse rise among americans it's being
[01:35.760 --> 01:40.920]  called a virtual interior police force well that's what it is that's what
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.800]  homeland security is that's what the tsa is this is all classical
[01:46.800 --> 01:52.800]  authoritarian and martial law culture now you notice that 60 plus percent of
[01:52.800 --> 01:57.440]  deportations have stopped they are legalizing illegals by fiat and are
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.320]  preparing to legalize anyone that's here but they're going to keep a vestigial
[02:01.320 --> 02:06.960]  border patrol in place to simply control narcotics coming across at the big banks
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.760]  aren't getting a slice of or a cut of the drug wars only to keep prices up by
[02:12.760 --> 02:17.680]  keeping competition out that's all it's for and then to put people in the
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.120]  private prisons who are dumb enough to use the globalist big bank products but
[02:23.120 --> 02:28.240]  as ron paul has always said watch out about a border fence it will only be
[02:28.240 --> 02:33.320]  used to keep you in because the globalist want the borders open he said
[02:33.320 --> 02:38.880]  we could have a border fence and most nations do but until you change the
[02:38.880 --> 02:42.720]  policies of basically legalizing anybody that can get here and putting them on
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.440]  welfare the border fence will only be used to keep us in and that is exactly
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.520]  what this is so it's very very frustrating that's a
[02:53.520 --> 02:57.920]  mclatchy article that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com it's
[02:57.920 --> 03:08.000]  also up on drugs report dot com the left hand side then we have other articles
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.920]  here in the stack today that I'm going to be getting to where the US government
[03:15.920 --> 03:23.360]  and the Pentagon have come out and said oh my gosh brace for mass terror attacks
[03:23.360 --> 03:27.960]  it's horrible al qaeda's gotten a foothold in western Iraq they've
[03:27.960 --> 03:33.160]  retaken fallujah they're having to send us troops back into iraq on top of the
[03:33.160 --> 03:41.000]  mercenaries al qaeda is taking much of the country right now and when you read
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.480]  the article it's just so bizarre because they say north africa has al qaeda
[03:46.480 --> 03:52.120]  iraq has al qaeda syria has al qaeda we need more funding and we need to be
[03:52.120 --> 03:55.640]  ready and need more homeland security domestically because al qaeda is going
[03:55.640 --> 04:01.200]  to hit us and hit us hard now for someone who's informed this is comical if
[04:01.200 --> 04:08.040]  it wasn't so serious al qaeda was created by zabignan brzezinski and saudi
[04:08.040 --> 04:14.600]  arabian intelligence in 1979 expanded under ronald reagan in the musia hadin
[04:14.600 --> 04:18.920]  operations against the russians i'm not romanicizing the russians but the west
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.080]  started that the russians came in to respond to it and were set up and
[04:23.080 --> 04:28.800]  basically bled dry just like vietnam was set up for the us by the russians and
[04:28.800 --> 04:34.000]  others fast forward ladies and gentlemen the globalists don't care they make
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.320]  money off the russian debacle the vietnam debacle they are manipulating the
[04:39.320 --> 04:42.200]  countries and regions off against each other it's called the great game it's
[04:42.200 --> 04:47.800]  called balkanization it's called making money off all sides al qaeda had to be
[04:47.800 --> 04:52.800]  supercharged and they had to get a new group of real al qaeda out of jihadi
[04:52.800 --> 04:58.600]  groups worldwide to be trained by qatari special forces saudi arabian
[04:58.600 --> 05:03.800]  special forces u.s. special forces nato special forces french special forces
[05:03.800 --> 05:08.080]  british special forces and and out of those groups had to create clandestine
[05:08.080 --> 05:15.440]  spinoff organizations that will be used to attack europe israel anybody the
[05:15.440 --> 05:20.240]  globalists don't like in the middle east or africa and the united states and
[05:20.240 --> 05:25.400]  when they shoot down u.s. airliners when they shoot down uk airliners when they
[05:25.400 --> 05:32.160]  shoot down u airliners there will be no discussion that the very missiles were
[05:32.160 --> 05:35.960]  given to them by different multinational arms dealers and brought in by the
[05:35.960 --> 05:40.320]  state department publicly there will be no discussion of that and there will be
[05:40.320 --> 05:46.600]  newscast saying alex jones says that firefighters that responded to the shot
[05:46.600 --> 05:51.720]  down airplane over minneapolis st paul or wherever it's going to be or over
[05:51.720 --> 05:57.160]  los angeles alex says the police shot the plane down no the police aren't
[05:57.160 --> 06:00.160]  involved the firefighters they'll respond to the shot down aircraft aren't
[06:00.160 --> 06:06.280]  involved the globalist world be involved years before as they've now done
[06:06.280 --> 06:10.560]  arming the very groups who will then attack us so they can take our liberty
[06:10.560 --> 06:14.480]  and the government can grandstand and have checkpoints and armored vehicles
[06:14.480 --> 06:18.080]  and surveil everyone and grop your children at the airport and put you in
[06:18.080 --> 06:26.480]  naked body scanners because of the al-qaeda threat that's all this is and
[06:26.480 --> 06:31.040]  there's just flipping it now from the al-qaeda threat to domestic threats and
[06:31.040 --> 06:34.120]  that it's terrorism if you don't want to give up your private property it's
[06:34.120 --> 06:38.120]  terrorism if you don't accept total police state criticizing the government's
[06:38.120 --> 06:42.080]  terrorism and the main terror threat is returning veterans gun owners tea
[06:42.080 --> 06:46.640]  partiers liberty constitutionalist you name it we've talked about this at
[06:46.640 --> 06:54.840]  nauseam but we have to get this information out to everybody a surge in
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.760]  the number I'm reading from the AP a surge in the number of aggressive al-
[06:58.760 --> 07:03.600]  qaeda affiliates and like-minded groups in the Middle East and North Africa poses
[07:03.600 --> 07:07.520]  a serious threat to US interest and allies the State Department said
[07:07.520 --> 07:13.560]  Wednesday in reporting a more than 40% increase in terrorist attacks worldwide
[07:13.560 --> 07:21.240]  between 2013 and 2012 the department also signaled out Iran as a major state
[07:21.240 --> 07:26.960]  sponsor of terrorism that continues to defy demands it prove its atomic
[07:26.960 --> 07:32.040]  ambitions are peaceful even as Washington pursues negotiation with Tehran
[07:32.040 --> 07:37.200]  ladies and gentlemen this is how the AP writes propaganda to the average person
[07:37.200 --> 07:40.920]  that thinks they're informed and actually reach news there's only about 20% of
[07:40.920 --> 07:44.200]  people actually even care about the news and think they're smart and think they're
[07:44.200 --> 07:48.520]  informed because they they they keep track of establishment news Iran is
[07:48.520 --> 07:55.840]  Shiite al-qaeda is a radical Wahhabi a Sunni group totally different groups that
[07:55.840 --> 08:00.040]  hate each other more than anybody else Saudi Arabia is though are the ones
[08:00.040 --> 08:04.760]  running al-qaeda but they imply here that that Iran is involved I'm not saying
[08:04.760 --> 08:08.520]  Iran is involved in terrorism the point is they just conflate the two mix the
[08:08.520 --> 08:12.520]  two so the average person reading this thinks Iran is behind the growth of al
[08:12.520 --> 08:20.960]  qaeda no the West turned over Libya to al qaeda to take it over and backed al
[08:20.960 --> 08:26.040]  qaeda with Western airstrikes that's on record and now even our own government
[08:26.040 --> 08:31.320]  admits Libya is much worse off and al qaeda is using Libya as a command base
[08:31.320 --> 08:35.960]  to invade all of Africa now that crisis erupts the West can use that as a
[08:35.960 --> 08:42.360]  smokescreen to invade other areas and see resources that has nothing to do with
[08:42.360 --> 08:47.960]  al qaeda so our government puts al qaeda in and then says they've got to be in
[08:47.960 --> 08:50.880]  Africa to fight al qaeda when they're actually running around murdering
[08:50.880 --> 08:55.960]  villagers for their property and the same thing for Syria the same thing for
[08:55.960 --> 08:59.280]  Iraq there was an article out yesterday about how they're having to send
[08:59.280 --> 09:04.720]  advisors and more troops and back to Iraq to fight al qaeda and our troops
[09:04.720 --> 09:11.040]  will actually now fight real al qaeda who was armed protected and given bases in
[09:11.040 --> 09:15.400]  western Iraq I mean this is how the globalist operate because we are
[09:15.400 --> 09:21.280]  politically illiterate the average American people are starting to wake up
[09:21.280 --> 09:24.880]  but they don't know what they're waking up to it's like to hear the door crash
[09:24.880 --> 09:27.680]  in and somebody yelling and screaming downstairs in your house you know

[15:33.080 --> 15:38.000]  fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one

[15:54.120 --> 16:07.080]  fake TV the burglar detourant
[16:25.080 --> 16:30.240]  coming up at the start of the next hour I'll get into Mayday and Beltane why has
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.480]  the left chosen that as their holy day well you got to understand the Jacobins
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.480]  and the French Revolution and the Illuminati it's all mainline history in
[16:39.480 --> 16:46.800]  Encyclopedia Britannica but the average person doesn't know about basic history
[16:46.800 --> 16:54.120]  the fact is that the left is known as the sinister hand or the hand of the
[16:54.120 --> 17:00.280]  devil and so until the last hundred and fifty years or so politics was not
[17:00.280 --> 17:08.800]  described as left or right but as the Jacobin satanic Luciferian society grew
[17:08.800 --> 17:15.920]  in power I'm gonna cover this in the next hour politics became one of left and
[17:15.920 --> 17:25.400]  right right means male and godly sinister or the sinister hand the left
[17:25.400 --> 17:30.640]  means evil and female and I'm not saying females are evil folks the point is is
[17:30.640 --> 17:35.680]  that that's that's where it all comes from so when you hear we're leftist it
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.040]  means we're devil worshipers and so you need to just know where that all comes
[17:40.040 --> 17:45.840]  from and of course the Republicans are off at their bohemian grove and skull and
[17:45.840 --> 17:51.320]  bones and they're just the fake right hand of the left to create the illusion
[17:51.320 --> 17:54.680]  so you think that there's only the left from the right when the left of the
[17:54.680 --> 18:00.920]  right is an occultic which means hidden world system and we live in an occult
[18:00.920 --> 18:04.680]  world system of left and right and people don't even know where it comes
[18:04.680 --> 18:12.160]  from now there's the definition sinister
[18:12.600 --> 18:19.020]  middle English sinister from Anglo-French on the left from Latin sinister
[18:19.020 --> 18:28.600]  sinister on the left side unlucky in auspicious see all of this encoded
[18:28.600 --> 18:32.800]  language is in public view if you know what it means and of course the elite
[18:32.800 --> 18:36.640]  do they all communicate with each other even on television giving each other
[18:36.640 --> 18:41.320]  codes and things and if you're not initiated into that if you're not part
[18:41.320 --> 18:44.960]  of the gang if you don't know their battle language then you don't understand
[18:44.960 --> 18:48.640]  what they're doing well I know their battle language I've studied their
[18:48.640 --> 18:53.200]  battle language and it's like a twilight zone episode to go through life
[18:53.200 --> 18:57.760]  watching them with their gang signs communicating running their operations
[18:57.760 --> 19:05.520]  celebrating our destruction trampling and being trampled upon a society that
[19:05.520 --> 19:09.280]  doesn't develop towards more virtue and more love but towards less more
[19:09.280 --> 19:14.120]  barbarous more murderous Winston we want to picture the future see a boot
[19:14.120 --> 19:20.600]  stomping on a human face forever goodness cornered and tied down and chained
[19:20.600 --> 19:26.840]  annihilated over and over again ritualistically for the power of evil
[19:26.840 --> 19:33.160]  I'm paraphrasing 1984 so I said I'd get into it I'm trying to focus and and
[19:33.160 --> 19:36.560]  really break down how it all works for you coming up I kind of just did right
[19:36.560 --> 19:42.320]  then didn't I it's coming up let me tell you about it now but I'll talk more
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.320]  about that in the first 30 minutes of the next hour than Tosh Plumlee's gonna
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.560]  be popping back in because again he's been told the subpoena is coming until
[19:50.560 --> 19:53.080]  that basically the subpoena is a gag order because it says you can't talk
[19:53.080 --> 19:58.480]  there so I want him to just get any everything else on record and you know
[19:58.480 --> 20:02.040]  what we'll take questions for Tosh Plumlee when he comes on we'll have him
[20:02.040 --> 20:06.280]  talk five minutes and then we'll take some calls for Tosh Plumlee the CIA
[20:06.280 --> 20:11.440]  contract pilot who's on record a CIA contract pilot whistleblower in the
[20:11.440 --> 20:16.600]  church committees you know why is he still flying for the CIA because they
[20:16.600 --> 20:20.840]  can't penalize him because he's public being public is the way to go they want
[20:20.840 --> 20:24.200]  to create the illusion that you can't stand up where everybody's scared
[20:24.200 --> 20:30.080]  nobody stands up and the evil takes over but again just like people don't know
[20:30.080 --> 20:36.040]  what Sauen or Sam Haines stands for they don't know what Beltane stands for
[20:36.040 --> 20:44.000]  Mayday they don't know what Al Qaeda is they don't know the criminals that run
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.960]  our country literally are the daddies the mommies the funders the sponsors the
[20:49.960 --> 20:58.160]  commanders of Al Qaeda because people don't know the basics of the planet they
[20:58.160 --> 21:03.040]  don't know its history they don't know its systems they don't know any of it
[21:03.040 --> 21:10.760]  you can become an outside observer and quite frankly an initiate of all this
[21:10.760 --> 21:15.400]  but you're not a supporter of it but you're the equivalent of an initiate if
[21:15.400 --> 21:21.320]  you would simply decide to study real history how they operate what they're
[21:21.320 --> 21:25.880]  doing why they plan to become God they believe merging with the machines but to
[21:25.880 --> 21:30.120]  do that first humans have to be defeated and then the machines have to be defeated
[21:30.120 --> 21:35.760]  before they merge with the higher consciousness and the entire 2001 space
[21:35.760 --> 21:42.760]  Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke is an allegory of that all right we're gonna come

[25:47.160 --> 25:53.400]  i am in overload right now i'm going to be honest with everybody on this
[25:53.400 --> 25:58.040]  thursday edition i don't know where to start next my head is spinning we've
[25:58.040 --> 26:04.360]  got video we're going to play later it's up on info wars calm house democrat
[26:04.360 --> 26:09.960]  basically all criticism of obama is straight up racism they're now wanting
[26:09.960 --> 26:16.840]  to shake down the nba and anyone that's quote homophobic and have them fired or
[26:16.840 --> 26:22.840]  run out i mean it is just a complete new modern socialist
[26:22.840 --> 26:28.600]  inquisition basically that's being set up another bizarre article at info wars
[26:28.600 --> 26:35.080]  calm ems worker tells mom we're agents of the state during home inspection
[26:35.080 --> 26:39.160]  because they called an ambulance and when they came in they basically said we're
[26:39.160 --> 26:42.600]  cps workers we're going to inspect your house and see if you're a good parent
[26:42.600 --> 26:50.200]  the cable people the phone people they've all been turned into government agents look it up
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.640]  under infraguard and other programs it's a total snitch society where they're just
[26:55.640 --> 27:02.360]  looking for something we've got that there's another great video up on info wars calm
[27:03.240 --> 27:08.600]  watch this this is what happens when a good guy has a gun these people are robbing this woman
[27:08.600 --> 27:14.040]  and a fellow runs up with a gun and gets them both on the ground and stops it
[27:14.040 --> 27:18.200]  just another great example of what happens with the power of the second amendment
[27:21.240 --> 27:26.920]  it's very important that we continue to hold up the fact that it's 40 plus times for every time
[27:26.920 --> 27:31.240]  a gun's using a crime it's used to frustrate crime that's the just department's own numbers
[27:31.240 --> 27:40.440]  but they don't want that information out we've got nsa news i've got a ton of news the latest
[27:40.440 --> 27:47.160]  developments in russia we've got huge news on super bugs i want to get to it all but briefly
[27:47.160 --> 27:53.640]  i want to get into an article that was up on info wars calm yesterday and i have a follow-up
[27:53.640 --> 28:01.400]  article being written by kit daniels right now and if this story can be expanded on
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.480]  and gotten out to the public it can really cause the administration problems
[28:08.840 --> 28:14.040]  that's why and stop a lot of their agenda in its tracks that's why when this story came out
[28:14.040 --> 28:20.360]  immediately we started getting emails and seeing comments in the article saying where's the links
[28:20.360 --> 28:29.960]  where's the proof uh where is it that this is true and if you read the articles he linked to
[28:31.240 --> 28:37.080]  you would read gun shops and sporting good shops that have firearms all over the country
[28:37.080 --> 28:42.600]  it's been going on for six years since obama got in being told we won't take your merchant account
[28:42.600 --> 28:47.080]  you can't fulfill credit card orders with us because you sell guns or ammo
[28:47.080 --> 28:52.440]  now they're expanding into archery equipment and the bank goes free market it's our decision
[28:53.160 --> 28:59.400]  but they're being directed it's discriminatory it's it's not legal by the justice department
[28:59.400 --> 29:05.880]  and we have a 2011 justice department memo link that was quoted in the mainstream articles that
[29:05.880 --> 29:11.080]  kit daniels linked to but we went ahead and added the link directly to it where it says and you know
[29:11.080 --> 29:15.800]  you need to not have uh you know each firearms or ammunition in the justice department memo
[29:15.800 --> 29:19.640]  and we know the justice department says they want to brainwash the public against guns
[29:19.640 --> 29:23.880]  we have that clip by the attorney general holder we've played a hundred times probably or more
[29:23.880 --> 29:30.920]  but go ahead and cue that up again if you can find it and we've got the uh mayors against gun
[29:30.920 --> 29:35.880]  violence and against illegal guns they're always changing the name run by bloomberg saying that
[29:35.880 --> 29:40.760]  they're working with banks to do this and social media like facebook and other groups
[29:40.760 --> 29:48.280]  and so we know this is going on and i immediately saw a big push saying our article was a hoax
[29:49.880 --> 29:54.440]  and they do this when we have an article exposing mangosi they come and say it isn't real because
[29:54.440 --> 29:58.920]  it is real or we have an article saying look they just purchased another hundred million
[29:58.920 --> 30:04.440]  bullets that makes it 1.6 billion or 2. plus billion as the number grew they go oh my gosh
[30:04.440 --> 30:11.560]  another fake story another fake story oh another fake story that drones are watching farmers and
[30:11.560 --> 30:19.880]  we're linked to local newspapers you this is absolute brainwashing absolute gaslighting
[30:20.440 --> 30:26.920]  where they go we're not we're not setting what the nsa is not spying on you we're not funding al-qaeda
[30:27.880 --> 30:32.760]  why obama care you can keep your doctor okay you're losing your doctor i never said you
[30:32.760 --> 30:38.920]  could keep your doctor or here's the clip of you saying it i didn't say that don't be crazy don't be
[30:38.920 --> 30:46.920]  paranoid who was it wrote for the bell tolls he was a socialist but he meant well bleeding heart
[30:46.920 --> 30:53.400]  liberal uh great guy wrote old man in the sea what's his name earnest himingway earnest himingway
[30:53.400 --> 30:57.720]  had his phones tapped his house broken into his being harassed his friends being messed with it
[30:57.720 --> 31:00.920]  got to him he should have just enjoyed it and laughed at it that's what we do to go and tell
[31:00.920 --> 31:06.600]  pro around here it's very enjoyable we make it fun it gives us energy sometimes i'm tired and go
[31:06.600 --> 31:12.040]  and tell pro kicks off and i go in at night work a few more hours you attack us we fight harder
[31:12.680 --> 31:17.240]  but he said the fbi's messing with me and harassing me and they said you're mentally ill
[31:18.040 --> 31:24.200]  and some of his handlers agreed so they they took him in for electroshock and over a hundred doses
[31:24.200 --> 31:28.520]  of it until his brain was fried and he had no memory and his beautiful mind was gone
[31:28.520 --> 31:33.160]  he didn't have a beautiful mind uh and uh was declassified a few years ago
[31:33.960 --> 31:37.160]  that indeed the fbi did all of it to mess with him and had his brain wiped
[31:39.640 --> 31:44.600]  but still he was kooky for thinking it you understand if the nsa is listening to you
[31:44.600 --> 31:47.800]  you're still a cook for thinking they are when they are
[31:50.520 --> 31:55.640]  fresh claim over the role of fbi played in suicide of earnest himingway that's how the
[31:55.640 --> 32:00.040]  guardian puts it you read the article well it's admitted the fbi was messing with him but
[32:00.040 --> 32:03.320]  you know the claim is it accurate that they made him commit suicide
[32:04.360 --> 32:07.080]  they could spin anything yesterday j carney was like
[32:07.960 --> 32:12.600]  yes the memo say we've got to have a unified talking point in the emails and yes we had said
[32:12.600 --> 32:17.640]  that there were no emails but we're talking about other talking points that don't deal with
[32:17.640 --> 32:30.120]  Benghazi in the Benghazi email you understand so here's the article holders latest scandal doj
[32:30.120 --> 32:37.000]  now pressuring banks to refuse service to gun stores now kit put the article out and linked
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.440]  to the document and he linked to some of the news articles that had it buried in there that it was a
[32:42.440 --> 32:49.880]  2011 federal deposit insurance corporation bulletin that said that merchant categories involving
[32:49.880 --> 32:55.400]  high risk things like firearms and ammo are disruptive to merchants kit didn't add his
[32:55.400 --> 33:01.480]  source he should have and it will be in his new article because you know my reporters need to have
[33:01.480 --> 33:05.480]  respect for themselves we're real journalists you know the new york times can say an anonymous
[33:05.480 --> 33:09.720]  source called them there were aluminum tubes and uranium yellow cake from niger when there
[33:09.720 --> 33:16.840]  wasn't and lie about it but you're allowed to have anonymous sources kit got contacted by a gun
[33:16.840 --> 33:22.040]  dealer in town that doesn't want to be named another gun dealer we know is willing to go on
[33:22.040 --> 33:26.840]  record about it we're trying to line that up right now that they were told by the bank we're
[33:26.840 --> 33:32.520]  shutting your account because of the justice department told us to show the article should
[33:32.520 --> 33:39.000]  have said this office was told by multiple gun dealers one of them is also a shooting range
[33:39.800 --> 33:46.920]  that's been on the show before but i can figure it out and that they've been told that that that
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.640]  by the bank that the justice department says we can't have this bank account with you now it's
[33:51.640 --> 33:56.920]  already in a 2011 memo it's already buried news articles that you know gun shops are mad because
[33:56.920 --> 34:03.160]  they're having their accounts that's in hundreds of articles so but the justice department doesn't
[34:03.160 --> 34:09.480]  want to have a discussion about this they because it'll it'll come out that with outside of law and
[34:09.480 --> 34:14.120]  they said we're going to go after the guns outside of law because we can't get a gun law passed a
[34:14.120 --> 34:19.800]  gun registration gun ban passed we'll do it with executive orders well even senator cornyn came
[34:19.800 --> 34:25.000]  out two weeks ago and said they're preparing an executive order to ban previously made guns from
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.240]  sale and to make you buy biometric guns i mean this is happening the attorney general said a
[34:31.240 --> 34:37.000]  month ago to congress he's looking at that and that they may make an administrative order well
[34:37.000 --> 34:46.280]  you can take your administrative order and shove it into your mayday parade buddy i mean these people
[34:46.280 --> 34:51.960]  are arming to the teeth against us training for war those memos are all public building fema camps
[34:51.960 --> 34:58.920]  training for war with gun owners and we put this article out and they freaked out i mean when you
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.240]  see them instantly hit and say it's not real it's not real it's not real they're scared to death that
[35:03.240 --> 35:09.960]  info wars is able to punch through the media burlin wall and cause a national debate i added a comment
[35:09.960 --> 35:15.960]  to the top of the article and it says this a holder's latest scandal doj now pressuring banks
[35:15.960 --> 35:23.080]  to refuse service to gun owners operation chokepoint also targets other legal businesses

[35:30.360 --> 35:36.360]  holder is shutting down businesses just like the nazis targeted their assets and later the
[35:36.360 --> 35:43.800]  companies of jews in the 1930s the doj has been caught shipping guns to drug dealers terrorist
[35:43.800 --> 35:49.240]  and gang members in mexico under the fast and furious yet holder is targeting legitimate
[35:49.240 --> 35:55.240]  lawful gun groups this is completely outside of the law and resembles the behavior of a
[35:55.240 --> 36:03.720]  dictatorship impeachment proceedings must begin immediately for the past several months the doj
[36:03.720 --> 36:10.520]  department of justice has been pressuring banks to refuse service to businesses the doj is targeting
[36:10.520 --> 36:17.000]  politically such as gun stores in a program entitled operation chokepoint under the program
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.400]  the doj headed by attorney general eric holder is aiming to shut down various legal businesses
[36:21.400 --> 36:25.400]  including firearms dealers and we've got links to the stinking chokepoint but he needs to add
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.480]  those more prominently not at the bottom purveyors of drug paraphernalia and pornography
[36:31.480 --> 36:37.160]  distributors by coercing financial institutions to close the bank account of merchant accounts
[36:37.160 --> 36:43.400]  associated with these businesses but nested within it you should add this is the word gun
[36:43.400 --> 36:49.640]  shops ammo and other high risk just like how have we been banned at universities and at del before
[36:49.640 --> 36:55.480]  that's been in the news and at libraries and at london train stations as we've shown and e u
[36:55.480 --> 37:01.640]  train stations they have computer filter programs for the public's quote safety that stop five
[37:01.640 --> 37:18.040]  stop five categories that are high risk gambling hacking horn crime and hate and now they're adding
[37:18.040 --> 37:24.360]  other categories uh illegal shop file swapping you know piracy so guess they're six there was five
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.520]  when i first learned of this like 15 16 years ago we were getting censored at first and getting
[37:28.520 --> 37:32.920]  the documents people were you know shooting video of the library saying this is a info wars.com
[37:32.920 --> 37:38.280]  you're not allowed to go there it's a hate site and so we threatened some of the companies that
[37:38.280 --> 37:42.360]  we're putting us in there and they backed off but smaller sites don't know how to do that they
[37:42.360 --> 37:49.080]  they stay banned so that's all this is is they have a database and they basically say don't do
[37:49.080 --> 37:54.360]  this and look the newspapers for more than a decade almost all of them will not take a gun
[37:54.360 --> 38:03.000]  a gun shop advertising most of them will not take um classified ads for guns credit list has
[38:03.000 --> 38:09.080]  stopped doing it this is how outside of the law through the establishment they're doing this and
[38:09.080 --> 38:16.120]  this is what the nazis did in 1933 they started having big banks refuse jews bank accounts then
[38:16.120 --> 38:21.800]  they stopped refusing them to have money transfers uh wires they had those back then on telegraph
[38:21.800 --> 38:25.960]  then they started not letting them have shipments on trains and they started not letting them have
[38:25.960 --> 38:31.560]  their businesses open started knocking the windows out crystal night and things like that and you can
[38:31.560 --> 38:36.360]  go oh whatever you know what's with the nazi analogy well i mean internal checkpoints black
[38:36.360 --> 38:43.720]  uniforms armored vehicles german shepherds i mean this is it this is it internal checkpoints
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.200]  and while they've got us busy thinking racism's under every table and and bringing in anti-freech
[38:50.200 --> 38:56.760]  movements and new FCC gestapo's they're going to go out and inspect every newsroom in the country
[38:56.760 --> 39:02.760]  to make sure you're not racist it's a witch hunt folks it's political soviet style persecution
[39:05.640 --> 39:12.520]  and this is a crystal knot against gun owners and against gun shops and the gun owners and gun
[39:12.520 --> 39:17.720]  shops are isolated they're alone they don't recognize historically what's happening to them
[39:17.720 --> 39:24.360]  i'm giving you the context right now so it's just like sanctions on iran or something
[39:25.320 --> 39:34.360]  or sanctions on russia these are illegal color of law racketeering fraudulent these words mean
[39:34.360 --> 39:44.200]  something and criminal mafia racketeering outside of the law color of law sanctions against gun
[39:44.200 --> 39:52.360]  owners see what do they call the new free press in 1993 45 in that white house memo that's now been
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.240]  released 30 pages but joseph era got the whole thing out of the clinton library that's coming
[39:57.240 --> 40:02.120]  out soon it's so bombshell he doesn't know what to even do with it it's so big the western journalism
[40:02.120 --> 40:09.400]  center they said we got to stop new media getting money and cut off their commerce we got to demonize
[40:09.400 --> 40:14.200]  any new media conspiracy theorists have our media do that to shut down the public having venues to
[40:14.200 --> 40:22.360]  be able to communicate they had just lost control of talk radio a few years before so we're actually
[40:22.360 --> 40:28.120]  in a revolution against them we're actually gaining ground when you launch a youtube site when you
[40:28.120 --> 40:33.960]  launch a website when you repost our information when you hand out flyers of the show when you
[40:33.960 --> 40:39.000]  start your own local radio show your own access show or sponsor somebody who you hear on the radio
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.920]  to have more time you are absolutely in a war and all you got to do in the war
[40:48.440 --> 40:53.960]  i'll use the moose hunting analogy up in michigan up in upstate new york up in other places where
[40:53.960 --> 41:02.920]  they've got some moose i guess montana you know utah whatever you've got to go to a lottery
[41:02.920 --> 41:10.040]  to be able here's an example if you don't want to pay to alligator hunt in south texas we can
[41:10.040 --> 41:14.920]  kill 15 foot alligators because they're overpopulated eating people's dogs and stuff you got to go to
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.160]  a lottery and then one out of five one out of ten depends on the year of the county
[41:19.160 --> 41:26.040]  you will get to go on public land and you will get to hunt an alligator okay and get boots made
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.760]  out of it we've done that you know my son right of passage he's killed three alligators
[41:30.760 --> 41:37.640]  by hand shot him in the head himself over the boat but the whole point is is that
[41:41.080 --> 41:45.880]  let's say we had a physical war with the criminal government there's 160 70 million
[41:45.880 --> 41:52.280]  dollars let's say 1 fight back 1.6 million combatants you'd have to go out and get a lottery
[41:54.040 --> 42:00.040]  for an establishment person to kill you go out and kill one person and i'm not saying do this
[42:00.040 --> 42:05.720]  it's an analogy it's over for them you go out and kill one globalist or one minion of theirs
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.320]  when you start that they will panic and all run to switzerland and we'll take the country
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.160]  i don't want to go there it's not going to happen we're going we're going to fix this peacefully
[42:15.160 --> 42:20.200]  but the same thing politically you pop up and do political stuff you pop up every week and do
[42:20.200 --> 42:26.520]  something a banner hang uh handout cards go to city council no lobby for pro second amendment
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.920]  pro sovereignty pro liberty move it's whatever is picking issue you go out and just do a little
[42:30.920 --> 42:35.240]  something every week you will bring them to their knees and they know that
[42:37.640 --> 42:41.640]  and that's why they want to shut us down instead of everybody else down because if you engage in
[42:41.640 --> 42:47.480]  the info war 90 percent of war is info war i agree with the pentagon it's over folks we've already
[42:47.480 --> 42:53.240]  got the military awake the military's the most a group a most awake group out there over 80 percent
[42:53.240 --> 42:57.400]  the globalists are in deep trouble now we're reaching out to the police
[42:59.080 --> 43:03.880]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine west virginia counties this year alone
[43:03.880 --> 43:08.440]  over 300 000 people in west virginia had their drinking water contaminated what are the health
[43:08.440 --> 43:13.080]  effects of having these drugs in our drinking water it's forced medical treatment without the
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.800]  consent of residents my friends water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to
[43:17.800 --> 43:21.800]  protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water
[43:21.800 --> 43:25.720]  on average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week
[43:25.720 --> 43:30.120]  few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[43:30.120 --> 43:36.200]  remove pesticides herbicides chloramines hydrofluorosalic acid sodium hexafluorosilicate
[43:36.200 --> 43:41.480]  all right it is in teats and coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste it is our responsibility
[43:41.480 --> 43:46.120]  to protect our families the establishment's not going to do it it's time to take action it's time

[45:08.680 --> 45:13.160]  indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than
[45:13.160 --> 45:18.440]  even outdoor air and most americans spend 90 percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[45:18.440 --> 45:23.800]  within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand
[45:23.800 --> 45:28.360]  types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.160]  million americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics
[45:33.160 --> 45:39.000]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.880]  that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated
[45:43.880 --> 45:49.320]  herbs and manufactured in the usa the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient

[46:22.120 --> 46:29.720]  going down going down now down to chicago that's part
[46:37.240 --> 46:41.720]  here's what i'm getting at if you let one aunt stand up they might all stand up and then there
[46:41.720 --> 46:49.400]  goes our way of life so the establishment's busy dividing us on religion race sex using some old
[46:49.400 --> 46:58.280]  evil potbellied billionaire as a reason to create all this guilt and how do we prove we're not racist
[46:58.280 --> 47:03.800]  and blah blah blah politically to beat white people over the head into acquiescing to turn
[47:03.800 --> 47:09.240]  their guns in because michael morris says you're racist if you own a gun look it up that's what he
[47:09.240 --> 47:14.840]  says every time he's on msnbc i tell you it's a bunch of old racist white people don't like guns
[47:14.840 --> 47:23.640]  they i mean don't like black people and so that's why they got guns really i got a video right here
[47:23.640 --> 47:31.320]  on info wars dot com of a black man jumping out of his car in about two seconds very professionally
[47:32.440 --> 47:39.080]  and stopping two people that are mugging a woman and her family and putting the criminals down on
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.480]  the ground and you're not gonna see that image on the news except locally we're gonna play that in
[47:43.480 --> 47:50.200]  the next hour but this is the type of stuff we're dealing with ladies and gentlemen and now
[47:50.920 --> 47:53.080]  we have to understand that if we just politically
[47:56.120 --> 47:59.480]  start doing stuff outside the box let's say you call yourself a real liberal
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.960]  cares about the environment cares about freedom but understands we've got a federal tyranny
[48:05.320 --> 48:09.480]  go out and do the issues you think are important but don't be part of some establishment group
[48:09.480 --> 48:15.880]  that siphons your energy off as astroturf to push their agenda as a renomop do your own thing be an
[48:15.880 --> 48:23.880]  individual create art create your own original ideas go out and do street art in in common areas
[48:23.880 --> 48:28.680]  where it's acceptable they have that in a lot of cities encounter all the stupid gang culture
[48:28.680 --> 48:37.560]  graffiti with powerful political messages sometimes i feel the urge and you know climb on
[48:37.560 --> 48:42.680]  things the middle of the night with spray paint oh i'm just joking the point is is that you've
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.560]  got to put it into physical action ladies and gentlemen we've got to totally overwhelm the
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.520]  globalist we've got to really get aggressive with them or they're going to start a physical
[48:52.520 --> 48:57.720]  civil war in this country that is meant to destroy the police and military to bring in the next wave
[48:58.680 --> 49:04.040]  as well as destroying the domestic resistance at the same time and that's why we're pushing for
[49:04.040 --> 49:11.560]  nonviolent civil disobedience but when they physically attack you for peaceful civil disobedience
[49:11.560 --> 49:21.240]  it's going to the next level i do not believe in offensive violence but i do believe in
[49:21.240 --> 49:27.000]  defending yourself and by the way that's all malcolm x ever said and he's been demonized
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.600]  lately as being someone who called for violence no he didn't no he didn't he called for defending
[49:32.600 --> 49:37.880]  yourself if you're attacked and ladies and gentlemen that's not terrorism if the feds at the
[49:37.880 --> 49:43.960]  bundy ranch would have shot those citizens most of them unarmed it would have been an act of
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.160]  government tyranny an act of government terrorism and a new 1776 would have started
[49:50.280 --> 49:57.240]  i i do not want that to happen every bone in my body is against it this hour don't forget was

[52:38.040 --> 52:43.800]  sanctions against gun owners and i told him to do the article last night he's gotten it done very
[52:43.800 --> 52:48.520]  quickly but i want to get the video link which he's now added of holders saying we got a brain
[52:48.520 --> 52:56.120]  wash the public added and just literally scores there's more than a dozen links proving the joint
[52:56.120 --> 53:02.200]  program to target guns by shutting down their merchant accounts of gun dealers gun shops okay
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.040]  and again they're real scared of this when this article went live i immediately saw people saying
[53:08.040 --> 53:14.600]  it was a hoax and when they do that it's because they've actuaryed that it will hurt them bad
[53:14.600 --> 53:21.880]  this is so criminal ladies and gentlemen what they're doing it is just beyond belief so justice
[53:21.880 --> 53:26.840]  department launches covert sanctions against gun owners we need a maximum operation against the

[53:40.680 --> 53:47.560]  full decompartmentalization model that we give them we understand the globalist master model
[53:47.560 --> 53:52.920]  i just got chills we know how to savage the enemy we know how to crush the enemy we know how to
[53:52.920 --> 53:59.240]  bleed the enemy out we know they're an enemy that's why we know we're willing to go head up
[53:59.240 --> 54:05.480]  against the enemy and in fact we love it and that's why they hate us because we've got their number
[54:05.480 --> 54:13.240]  we know who they are and we're going in nothing on earth's gonna stop it and the more they squeeze
[54:13.240 --> 54:18.680]  the more it validates everything we've documented so they want to deny deny deny g e capital bank
[54:18.680 --> 54:24.840]  of america they're all cutting off loans and bank accounts to major gun dealers major gun
[54:24.840 --> 54:31.080]  manufacturers parts manufacturers and they're now going after sporting good stores and it's time
[54:31.080 --> 54:37.560]  for sporting good stores to not go i guess we'll go along with it not sell ar 15s or m4s because
[54:37.560 --> 54:42.840]  you don't like it you know leave us alone just this department go after the other shops they'll
[54:42.840 --> 54:52.200]  get all of you in the end morons if you don't hang together this came this intel came to us from
[54:52.200 --> 55:02.600]  gun shops major gun shops in austin and the it wasn't even intel it's already hidden in plain view
[55:02.600 --> 55:09.320]  their operation but now they're doing it to everybody basically well we better get gun dealers to
[55:09.320 --> 55:16.040]  stand up together we better get aggressive or we're gonna lose everything but see what do they say
[55:16.040 --> 55:20.280]  at wake up in the tank the Bradley fighting vehicle is ramming the building running over people
[55:20.280 --> 55:26.120]  shooting them we've got the flare footage this is not an assault well when the Martians land
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.280]  in mars attacks they run around saying don't run we are your friends the laughing when the people
[55:32.280 --> 55:39.240]  stop and they can shoot them that's satire in mars attacks is making fun of the military tactic
[55:39.240 --> 55:45.000]  of saying don't run we're your friends because the germans in world war one in english and french
[55:45.000 --> 55:53.400]  would actually broadcast on loudspeakers don't run we are your friends and they found statistically
[55:53.400 --> 55:57.560]  people go we don't have to fight we don't have to die they're my friends and then the germans are
[55:57.560 --> 56:06.840]  ah over the trenches they are netting of course all the rural devil dogs all the marines you can
[56:06.840 --> 56:11.240]  read the books written about it they just for some reason didn't buy that line and wanted to kill
[56:11.240 --> 56:16.200]  so the germans began to fear the marines because they were all from farm boys and people they wanted
[56:16.200 --> 56:22.360]  to kill and they wanted to fight and it's not bad to want to kill another man that's trying to kill
[56:22.360 --> 56:28.440]  you that's a normal instinct to get into it you shouldn't want to kill innocents there they are
[56:29.320 --> 56:38.280]  don't run we are your friends that's all this is don't run we are your friends no you're not

[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.960]  now get it out to everyone you know kit daniels put out a story that went viral yesterday via
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:53.000]  twitter facebook and drudge report dot com and again we got hammered with dis info emails
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.440]  and comments saying it was a fake article even though it linked to mainstream news articles
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.840]  admitting that there was a federal deposit insurance corporation bulletin that put gun shops
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:10.040]  gun dealers sporting goods stores and ammo sellers in with quote third party payment processing
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:17.480]  relationships as risky and it lists in there that these are things that are seen as risky
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:24.760]  now they are going after the gun dealers and we were contacted by multiple
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.400]  multiple gun shops in austin to bring this to kids attention we knew this was already going on
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.640]  it's been all over the news that the big banks and g e capital and the rest of them won't loan
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:42.440]  money to gun shops or gun manufacturers and that major gun manufacturers like smith and
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:48.120]  wesson are leaving california because of the microstamping the white house has said and and
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.760]  eric holder the criminal attorney general on record has said we will use stuff outside of
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:58.760]  law to get the guns will ban importation will shut down the lead smelting facilities they
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:04.920]  shut the last one down this year we will shut down the parts he may sign an executive order
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.560]  they've said senator cornyn's warned of this holder testified they may do an executive order
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.720]  to ban all guns except biometric guns which they can shut off or you wear a little ring or bracelet
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.680]  it's all happening and then they want to tell you none of this is real
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.800]  just like three years ago when drudge linked to our article about the texas power commission
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:31.640]  we just pointed to what they said saying that they shut down the power plants they were it
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.880]  would double texas prices that was in the la times now last week two three years after we broke it
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:44.680]  the white house came out and said we were liars they had the white house communications chief
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:52.680]  come out and say that that was not a true report on drudge you bet it was a true report pull up
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:59.320]  the la times last week it says because the power plants are being closed the power prices are
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.720]  doubling because the power plants have been closed the power prices are doubling because the power
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.720]  plants are being closed the power prices are doubling i'm going to say it again for the white
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:15.320]  house because the power plants are being closed the prices are doubling let me say it again
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:22.380]  Because the power plants are being closed, the power prices are increasing.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:26.420]  I'm going to say this again, Obama said you could keep your doctor and it would cut your
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:30.180]  healthcare costs to the cost of a telephone or cable bill when it's already more than
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.180]  doubled it.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:35.180]  And you can't keep your doctor and you're getting screwed.
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:37.420]  I'm going to say it again, you can't keep your doctor.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.460]  There are death panels they lied to you.
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.620]  They are coming after the guns.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:43.740]  He promised in his first election he swore he wouldn't come after the guns.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:44.740]  Not your rifle.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.740]  Not your shotgun.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.740]  Not your handgun.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.740]  None of them.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.740]  You want me to play Biden?
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.100]  You want me to play Obama again?
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.980]  I mean the guy says two plus two equals five to your kids and they say you didn't build
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.980]  your business.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.700]  Now who's the liar here?
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.940]  I am sick of it.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.340]  I am tired of it.
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.980]  It is garbage.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:06.220]  Oh man the fact that they get away with this.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:13.620]  So now we've put out a whole new article that just neurotically links to all the just
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:18.420]  department documents telling banks and newspapers and everybody not to let you advertise or
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.540]  have loans or have a bank account if you sell guns or ammo or accessories and we have absolutely
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:30.420]  loaded it up like a giant baked potato pouring over with all the trimmings right there for
[01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:36.500]  you to shove it down their degenerate lying throats.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.500]  I am sick of these people literally just lying incessantly.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.700]  I mean we're not arming Al Qaeda they said two years ago.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.820]  We're not giving them heat seeking missiles.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:53.860]  We're not giving them anti aircraft service to air missiles and now it's all over the
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:55.180]  news two years later.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.420]  We broke that again.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.380]  How do we break it?
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.420]  We have all the sources and we can watch the Al Qaeda videos because they don't really
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.620]  work for the globalist.
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.100]  They're protected and the doors open for them and they're given the weapons but these guys
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:16.040]  all want to be rock stars like your kid wants to be a rock star or a music star or a country
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.380]  star or a movie star or a sports star.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.380]  Most kids are delusional they're taught that and they think they don't exist and aren't
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.660]  important unless they're a movie star or famous or something.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:29.340]  Well it's the same way in the Middle East it's just that these little Saudi Arabian
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:34.260]  kids that are in the Wahhabis cult or the people that grow up in Afghanistan or wherever
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:41.020]  they want to blow up a bunch of army troops or marines or they want to fly a plane into
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.320]  a building or they want to hijack a plane or they want to shoot planes down with heat
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:51.260]  seeking missiles they don't feel like they exist unless they did it.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:53.740]  So they videotape it all.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:06:01.540]  Two weeks before they announced chemical attacks there were videos of them going I mean I played
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:07.100]  the clips here and shooting Saudi Arabian made chemical weapons we even went and looked
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:15.340]  it up they were German and Saudi Arabian designs and shooting them at the Assyrian military
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.900]  and Assyrians were saying we're being hit by chemical weapons well how did they respond
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.660]  in our media they just said no.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:31.100]  Just the Assyrian not the Saudi group has launched the attack when it was the Saudi Arabians
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.500]  launching the attack on the Syrians I mean it makes my head spin because the average
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.940]  American can't find Syria they can't find Saudi Arabia I mean I can see the Mediterranean
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:46.220]  in my mind right now and I can see Israel I can see Syria I can see Israel Lebanon Syria
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:54.140]  to the north to the northwest I can see Turkey to the northeast I can see Iraq and Jordan
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:07:06.300]  I can see Iran I can see Georgia above that above Syria above Turkey I know the players
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:10.420]  I know who's in Lebanon I know what percentage is Christian in Lebanon which percentage is
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:17.140]  Coptic which percentage is Orthodox which percentage is Catholic I mean and I'm sure
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:22.100]  I mean the most these lazy CIA people only analysts know this type of stuff even the
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:30.620]  CIA they're so incredibly lazy I'm not saying I'm anybody special except that I don't know
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:36.300]  all the baseball scores I don't know what Mickey Mannell pitched in 1945 or whenever
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:43.540]  he was playing baseball I don't know what Babe Ruth's favorite dinner was actually I was
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:48.020]  I saw a painting or a photo in a hotel talking about his favorite thing to eat in the hotel
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:52.180]  so I guess I didn't know what his favorite food is the point is I wish I didn't know
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:08:00.620]  that that is wasted space in my brain and you bet I'm a maniac ladies and gentlemen
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:07.580]  I am totally sick and tired of knowing what's going on and seeing these people lie to us
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.500]  and I'm gonna stop ranting I'm gonna settle down right now Justice Department launches
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:20.220]  covert sanctions against gun owners media denial is part of disinformation campaign
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:25.660]  the US Department of Justice is currently attacking the Second Amendment by Fiat while
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:31.740]  constantly denying its abuse despite clear evidence to the contrary I told you day one
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:38.220]  from our sources that Fast and Furious was done to blame the Second Amendment and you
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:47.980]  know how I knew before even at sources in 2009 we played these on the air we have Attorney
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:54.180]  General Holder and Big Sis and all of them at press conferences bragging how they have
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:59.700]  a gun tracking program into Mexico showing why we need to restrict the Second Amendment
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.500]  because guns from the Southwest are going into Mexico and then later they said they'd
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:10.500]  never heard of the program and it was all made up we have video of them announcing
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.700]  the program not just saying that they're the one shipping the guns in they just said we're
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:22.900]  tracing the guns and naming the name of the program Operation Gun Runner Fast and Furious
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:28.780]  is a smaller section I mean do you know how frustrating that is we know they ordered to
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:33.340]  stand down at Benghazi we know they're taking giant energy deals and giving billions of
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:38.140]  their friends to launder it back on the Democratic Party in an attempt to extinct the Republican
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.700]  Party forever and again if they're able to extinct the Republican Party there's not even
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.060]  that fake opposition they don't even have to act like there's something going on and
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:53.020]  it'll all be race politics here on out race war with Homeland Security playing the part
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:10:00.300]  of the referee between the imploding civilization now I'm going to settle down I really need
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:06.780]  to settle down and go to break and I'm going to come back and get into May Day the communist

[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:10.700]  u.s. senate don't worry this show is documented alex jones on the gc n radio network i fell
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:19.020]  into a burning ring of fire i went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:26.260]  burns burns if you go to england another area you can go to sites where they have dug up
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.540]  the remains of what they believe to be tens of thousands of people you go to one site
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:35.540]  and it's basically dead adults and children who had already died of natural causes like
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:40.980]  stonehenge that was a burial site a burning site they burned them in ditches in front
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:47.060]  of it but you go to other standing stones they were sacrificial sites and the most common
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:52.340]  way to kill people all over europe was to burn them in a large wicker man if it was
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:58.780]  a male and you wanted to have a right for the summer coming up to have a good harvest
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:05.820]  you would burn the strongest man in your tribe the Aztecs did the exact same thing basically
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:09.820]  the taller you are they would kill you that's one reason anthropologists say a lot of Mayans
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:15.620]  are so short well the same stuff went on in europe but different times of the year though
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:23.420]  when they would herald midway and spring it was a sign of fertility so the Aztecs would
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:28.580]  kill women and pregnant women throwing them into pools of water the europeans like to
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:33.660]  burn little kids the Aztecs cut their hearts out and then the priests class sold their
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:42.100]  meat below the pyramids as the main source of protein well the the different druidic
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:50.540]  and gaelic cultures they would simply burn them that's where you get bonfire is a bonfire
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:54.780]  so I wanted to know what mayday was and this is from the encyclopedia mayday may 1st is
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:59.220]  an ancient northern hemisphere spring festival and usually a public holiday it's what the
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:04.780]  communists celebrate as their day it is also traditional spring holiday it coincides with
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:09.140]  international workers day and in many countries that celebrated the latter it was referred
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:16.220]  to as mayday dances singing and cake are usually part of the celebrations of that day includes
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:22.540]  traditional mayday celebrations are the Celtic festival of belting the germanic festivals
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:29.500]  of wall purges night and it is the midway through the spring and it goes through the
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:37.340]  different human sacrifices done in each country but belting was the gaelic sacrifice of children
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:45.420]  in bone fires and all households had to light the fires but at the central fires they would
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:51.260]  burn children and others so I wanted you to know where it comes from so so let's fast
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:57.620]  forward the Middle East finish did this as well attire other areas it's in Leviticus
[01:18:57.620 --> 01:19:06.740]  it's in genesis the burning of the children now let's fast forward to 1776 revolution
[01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:11.940]  is in the air worldwide the masonic order is moving in the united states along with
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:16.220]  christian groups and others but they want to control it with george washington others
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.900]  who spoke out against the illuminati later and against the jackabins so you could say
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:25.860]  he was a good masons like any group is good and bad and you've seen me on history channel
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.460]  with a special on that breaking it down as an expert and I'm just giving you a gestalt
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:35.260]  right now this is so huge and complex but the jackabins society was the french name
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:42.020]  of the illuminati founded in 1776 a two years after our revolution really already started
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:48.940]  we're told 1775 early start of the year before but officially 1776 july 4th well the illuminati
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:54.980]  wanted to hijack this and control revolutions that was their whole program they knew revolutions
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:20:00.260]  against old forms of corruption a corrupt church a decadent royalty they wanted to not
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:05.380]  overthrow that to create equity they wanted to overthrow that we have the illuminati documents
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:10.100]  because a post writer got struck by lightning in braveria so we got it and they admitted
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:16.260]  it was real that's why it's in the encyclopedia that they would actually overthrow the entire
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:20.980]  order go to a nine day work week abolish the family and that everything was just about
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:26.900]  their small group having absolute dominion to murder slaughter drink blood kill everybody
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:32.140]  and that's what the french revolution was just murder kill death slaughter rape satan
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:38.060]  worship nine day work week changing the calendar overthrowing reality a boot stomping on the
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:45.340]  face forever aka george arwell winston is being tortured by the jackabins 1984 is an
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:52.460]  occultic communist jackabin revolution where society's about being ugly and evil and torturing
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:59.020]  not about having virtue is what o brian tells him this is the system and so the illuminati
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:03.540]  with the jackabins oh this is not this is like mainline history this is not my opinion
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:08.500]  this is in the history books just no one knows it just like people that people think i ran
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:14.300]  as al qaeda when it's the opposite group Saudi Arabia is al qaeda so all of that is going
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:21.300]  on and now they're using al qaeda as like their their jackabins society to stir up trouble
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:26.740]  bring down societies create the crisis so they can come in aka episode one two and three
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:31.420]  of star wars where the emperor stages attacks against himself to bring in a police state
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:36.940]  and it's very simple how they create ordered out of chaos and george washington said the
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:41.540]  illuminati is trying to take over masonry we've got to stop them the jackabins are evil the
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:47.180]  french revolution is evil and he stopped them in america or we would never have had any basic
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:54.180]  freedom so that's mayday folks we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones is

[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:57.340]  all this Benghazi news breaking he's been told he's going to be subpoenaed which is a gag order
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:27:03.020]  so he's getting it all on record now and he's been subpoenaed before obviously as a famous
[01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:08.060]  whistleblower on iran contra and other events even flew weapons to castro back when he was
[01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:12.140]  allies with the us he's been doing it since the late fifties so if you don't know who he is he's
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:18.220]  very well known one of the most famous whistleblowers out there um obviously most people only know
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:23.740]  about the pentagon papers uh and then other than that they don't even know who whistleblowers are
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:28.380]  they know who Edward Snowden is this is one of the only Benghazi whistleblowers that hasn't
[01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:32.140]  been basically disappeared they've been changing their identities you name it so i want to open

[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:57.900]  touch it because it's cut out well no i mean i have sure sure why why are you saying you won't
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.540]  follow gag orders now why are you going public when you pulled your facebook when they threatened you
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:13.100]  last year well i uh i don't feel i should be right i mean they sort of left me alone perhaps i
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:20.140]  wouldn't even uh went into this but then dusty questions were all originated that from information
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:25.980]  that came from the nato's doors over in afghanistan who was working that project after he'd been
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:34.220]  transferred uh from working the mexico task force project and in in that they found out about weapons
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:40.140]  he contacted me and then that started uh the question a question is about the 11th and galsy
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:48.940]  questions i had after uh that evidently created problems in dc and started them wanting to know
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:56.620]  where my contacts were i told the information that i was a journalist that would not oppose those
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:03.900]  contacts they went undercover went down for a few months and then came back up again
[01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:12.540]  that meant me uh this came out after i saw after your program and a few sources one military and
[01:33:12.540 --> 01:33:20.860]  one civilian source contacted me a few days ago and told me that i better watch what i was doing
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:30.780]  because the uh doj was in process of uh issuing going to issue a subpoena on me the reason that i've
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:38.220]  decided to make contact was i know what happened when you're subpoena to go back and testify to a
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:43.100]  committee the nature of what i'm dealing with and what i've dealt with in the past it would be
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:48.300]  immediately classified top speaker committee sensitive and that is where the gag comes in
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:55.100]  because at that point if i continued to relay those questions and i asked for answers then i would be
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:00.220]  in violation of a national security statute in subject to five uh i think it's 20 years ago
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:05.260]  me going to federal prison i went and talked to an attorney about this and then he told me to be
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:11.180]  extremely careful and then i decided well it's the only thing that i can do is again try to go
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:18.220]  out to the sunshine law and put this all out uh before the fact and so that's the reason for me
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:25.020]  in the last few days going on all these programs and talking about it what do i expect to happen
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:31.500]  i expect that the political powers that are that these will try to turn this political
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:37.500]  and try to say that i am trying to undermine with this plant and elect reelection or election
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:45.100]  campaign which is not the truth so and i've already been told that that's what that particular
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:54.860]  group thought of that way uh or say is that formally has been all paid by others to go out
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:35:02.380]  and undermine the plant stands for the president i think though she hasn't said she's going to go
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:07.980]  i have no beef with the plant this is not about policy this is about arms shipment
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:16.300]  going from our direct commercial sales program international gun running on a large scale
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:21.740]  but then gosh his death the four guys brought this to the surface
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:27.420]  they tried to bury it ever since i was on your program last time this is tried that they tried
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:34.860]  to bury it buried the only reason i could buy those 11 questions they're yes or no questions
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:41.100]  they're very simple but they can ask those questions and get an answer from our elected
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:47.740]  officials if they say no to some of those questions and then later down the line we find out that
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:54.220]  that answer should have been yes and we've got them in another lie and might possibly be able
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:36:01.580]  to bring charges and get them out of office um i thought it got loose into this i never intended
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:08.300]  for it to go this far i opened up the facebook page mainly to pull all this information together
[01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:14.700]  into one place so that the american people or whoever's interested in this can go out and do
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:21.180]  their own research study what they can find through me pointing the way by pulling all these
[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:27.260]  articles together not only about being gossiped about mexico and about other illegal operations
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:33.340]  that i happen to know where to go to get the confirmation because of my background in association
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:39.180]  with government black operation uh dating all the way back to conference uh in uh in patuva
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:47.580]  so i tried to say hey wait a minute they're losing our freedom by degrees and this is
[01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:54.620]  one example of how we're losing those freedoms is by having specialists and lobbyists having direct
[01:36:54.620 --> 01:37:02.220]  interest uh access to our elected officials for the purpose of selling weapons and making money
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:08.780]  and then to cut out companies going back and making those campaign contributions that they
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:19.820]  need so bad we sent and sent 24 letters out state department to doj and uh uh uh five sitting
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:25.100]  down they did not answer the questions they did not address those questions and the only thing
[01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:31.340]  that we got back from the congressman was a reform letter requesting campaign contributions
[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:36.300]  they did not address the questions did not even make reference to what was in the body of the letters
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:40.300]  uh that was sent out it shows they're totally disconnected from reality and their staffers
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:45.900]  didn't even show it to them a very serious whistleblower letter let's expand on this now then
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:52.540]  clearly uh they don't want your questions to be looked at so they want to question you
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:58.300]  sending the subpoena that's basically a gag order uh but undoubtedly the justice department is a
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:05.420]  listening now and watching now and b will be creating a transcript later for eric holder
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:10.060]  and hillary clinton to read this is the kind of stuff that will come across their desk so there's
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:14.300]  a good chance one of these people will read it that's obviously why you told hillary this isn't
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:20.140]  personal communicating to their gangster group uh in words that they'll understand what do you want
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:28.220]  to say to the uh nsa mop up crew and the rest of them they're listening to this well i i i was
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:35.660]  just taking out a policy i was uh six people there's good people in the nsa but there's also
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:41.180]  gatekeepers political gatekeepers that put into all these organizations mainstream media and
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:45.820]  every place else so the good people that are actually working in our government and working
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:51.500]  for the people can't do their jobs over this has been a slow process of eroding i call this
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:59.500]  american slow coup uh which by infiltrating uh political cloning in the strategic position
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:05.340]  to be gatekeepers and suck up any derogatory information like gun running the international
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:11.740]  gun running and other matters and keep that from hitting on the mainstream media mainstream media
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:20.860]  is infiltrated uh with all kinds of government gatekeepers to stop information from getting to
[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:27.660]  the american people so that they can make wise decisions so i saw with what i i'm background
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:33.980]  in my experience i can see it happening we're losing our freedom my small degree gradually
[01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:38.620]  gradually gradually and by the way mr plumley they are hiding the evil in plain view they
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:45.020]  announced last year of the quote legalization of cia and others inside media putting out
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:50.140]  psi ops and disinformation now that's always been going on there's the headline us repeals
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:55.500]  propaganda ban spreads government made news to americans but it's not even government propaganda
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:40:00.780]  it's criminal networks that have shut off the eyes and ears of even the government
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:06.300]  so they can get away with anything my god this is the biggest national security threat ever
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:15.260]  the government has had a corporate fraudulent coup d'etat within it and these people are so greedy
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:20.380]  that john corzine's making 40 to one bets with other people's money at mf global and not getting
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:25.420]  in trouble that's an example of how ruthless they are only bernie madeoff got in trouble
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:30.220]  because he stole money from other globalists the globalists have gotten to the point that
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:37.500]  they are literally above the law and are so dumb they thought they could arm al qaeda publicly to
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:42.140]  blow up christian churches and shoot down aircraft with missiles we gave them they are not going to
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:50.300]  get away with this tosh well the reason to say do that is that they have gone on a program through
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:57.020]  any different presidents i would say to sympathize the people so that we don't react
[01:40:57.020 --> 01:41:02.380]  then they can slide this through in other words what i'm saying leads the people into a false sense
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:08.220]  of apathy and apathy is what's in this country uh it's just uh people don't want to get involved
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:12.460]  they don't want to know that i don't care about what i'd like you know blah blah blah and all that
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:17.980]  john you you hear it all the time there's a lot of talk going out there everybody can define the
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:23.020]  problem that they got but i guess we hear any solid solutions i'd like just to see any of these
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:30.540]  organizations formally a goal or a plan to actually make the changes all i basically here across the
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:36.780]  board is stating what the problem is i guess we hear anyone state how well i mean i'll tell you
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:41.820]  the answer recognize that holder came out and said we need to brainwash the public and that's
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:47.900]  what's going on is literal brainwashing it went on before holder this has been going on
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:53.020]  no i know but it's coming to a head it's kind of like termites termites finally eat a house so much
[01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:58.300]  a big wind comes along it blows over well our foundation is eroded and we're about ready to
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:02.540]  call and then stick a fork in us because the american people are letting it happen and we're
[01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:09.020]  about done i agree here's the attorney general tosh here it is and we need to do this every day
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:14.300]  of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:19.500]  they are now on the news saying your children don't believe uh that you're their parents
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:25.100]  the state is the parent and we can take your guns and world government's good what would you call
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:29.420]  the ruling class tosh as we go to break what would you call this group of criminals just criminals
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:35.260]  i don't special interest uh all of the money i mean if it's been going on
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:40.300]  oh look i was involved in an iran country i'm please see 130 so i was i watched people
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:45.580]  close close next to us i didn't watch it i mean you're my friend all right i'll pull
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:51.580]  marine naval air station uh gun uh drugs going all over the place no i know i've had family
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:55.740]  that saw that too tell you what stay right there we're gonna come right back to tosh blumbling
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:43:03.100]  and your phone calls randy rodney lee others how can you save a ton of money and prepare for

[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:54.940]  been gagged and sealed but he is one of the main witnesses all i know is uh they recruited heavily
[01:46:54.940 --> 01:47:00.060]  out of texas different government agencies mainly out of the army so i've had a lot of few family
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:05.900]  that did different stuff some of the pretty senior and on the muscle end of things and they all just
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:10.220]  said the government's totally evil and those horrible things there's on the top there's a light
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:14.620]  side and there's a dark side and there's good people in government that are trying to do good but
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:20.940]  they're less and less and tosh i want to go to phone calls but would you agree though that it's
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:26.620]  getting worse and that the light side in government is getting smaller or is it that the good guys

[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:34.060]  well toss plumbly one of the most famous iran contra you name it whistleblowers ever
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:38.220]  still flies contracts for the cia
[02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:45.020]  because he's been a congressional testimony that was authorized so they can't stop him from
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:53.180]  still having his job he has broken huge Benghazi information last year that's now been vetted
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:57.100]  and confirmed by a lot of the information that's been coming out so he's gotten contacted the
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:01:01.660]  just department subpoena is coming that will basically gag him it'll say that he's not allowed
[02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:06.700]  to talk about it once he testifies they'll then say all of that is secret and he can never talk
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:11.420]  about it again like he did with iran contra but if you just joined us in the last segment
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:17.500]  he put all his cards on the table and just started talking about i personally in flights flew 40
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:22.860]  tons of cocaine into the united states iran contra sanctioned by the white house i flew
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:29.020]  the guns back out well that's all admitted now but his testimony was sealed so i guess in a way
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:35.180]  he just broke that gag order or has that gag order that national security order elapsed
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:41.020]  or are you just really getting in their face tosh i'm really getting in their face i was i've been
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:44.700]  told it hasn't collapsed that's what my attorney told me i better not go in the air and keep talking
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:48.940]  about this because i was going to get myself in a lot of trouble my feeling is if i weren't out there
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:54.780]  before the fact i was undocumented invented by many different sources which i have done and that's
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:02:00.300]  the reason i opened up my face this page and started compiling all this stuff together to protect me
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:05.660]  because i knew if i continued to talk mainly about iran contra and the um uh the weapons
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:10.220]  shipment and violence with the bolded amendment was setting up for the southern front and point
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:15.980]  west of the secret airbase of town alina c-130 flights going in there and documented in the
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:21.740]  graph opera and all these uh secret coded uh in the victim's program that lives in the victim's
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:28.380]  program uh i figured man hey in the answer to the other guy gentleman's question how did it
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:33.020]  escalate it started escalating at that point that's the reason i brought up iran contra
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:37.900]  it started escalating at that point i began to realize hey wait a minute we have another entity
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:42.780]  out here the average eight to five americans cannot comprehend that other world that lives
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:48.540]  out there the world of politics the loaders of the fuel refuelers the secret air bases
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:54.460]  are possible with uh central america uh john hols ranch who received ten thousand dollars a month
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:03:00.860]  from cia money uh point west oliver north sixteen felony uh suddenly paroled and becomes
[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:06.540]  americans hero and then passes judgment on a pilot like me i wish these kind of things i've
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:12.060]  bet but so then you're sitting here and you're saying well what do i do about it do i do like
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:16.860]  everybody else do i sit and piss and moan about it or am i going to do something about it i'm a
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:24.460]  c130 pilot now and i've been taught that cia okay if i piss for cia off i don't really care they
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:31.420]  piss me off i was i'm talking way out of school way out of school and i know that but somebody's
[02:03:31.420 --> 02:03:37.580]  got to get out here and rattle the american people and get them off the couch and get them
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:44.460]  engaged and the way to do it is get them engaged and start studying and reading what the hell is
[02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:49.740]  really going on in this country and then get out and use their god-given rights and their talents
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:54.700]  and that put us off to it that's all i can tell you about that sure i want to go back to calls
[02:03:54.700 --> 02:04:01.020]  powerful i want to go back to call sir but specifically when you look at all of this
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:07.020]  the public has been in denial or they feel powerless and and and the big issue is this is
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:12.940]  getting worse and worse the tyranny is expanding and to show how they gave you a thin cover they
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:16.860]  told you it was interdiction that you were getting the cocaine and flying it back here because
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:22.620]  i remember reading the iran contra files with the republic uh to destroy the cocaine you then
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:28.940]  learned that that really wasn't going on well some of it was and some of it was the special
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:33.100]  ops that were filtering into the pen raised up the money to get the guns for the contra that
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:37.500]  doesn't mean that that was a complete government thanks in operation but it won't run out of the
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:44.860]  white house period i would do cutouts and stuff like that i was on cbs about our uh a force service
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:51.260]  aircraft uh being used as cutouts to private companies in order to cure the drugs down there
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:57.660]  i mean there is another world out there that the eight to five do not understand that even exist
[02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:03.180]  and all i've been trying to do is say wait a minute this matter is escalating otherwise
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:09.820]  i'll answer your your question i think i got it right so i start seeing this happen then i start
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:13.820]  seeing my buddies going to jail then i start seeing some of them committing suicide then i
[02:05:13.820 --> 02:05:18.860]  start seeing things with fascination and then i had the characters to fascination applied upon
[02:05:18.860 --> 02:05:25.180]  me i was the best way to stop an operation is control the communication i started watching
[02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:30.540]  gatekeepers being infiltrated in the mainstream media to suck up any information that may be
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:36.220]  derogatory to a ongoing no i understand they killed what do you know about barry seal and others
[02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:42.060]  being killed barry seal was killed by columbians that was tipped off by our own government so
[02:05:42.060 --> 02:05:47.500]  basically i say during the reagan administration that information was leaked out through the very
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:53.580]  people which could possibly happen to me in a way that brought stand in how the hell did they get
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:58.300]  into this country of the illegal to come out here and gun him down put them in his Cadillac when the
[02:05:58.300 --> 02:06:03.500]  judge put him in a safe house yes barry seal was my friend i flew the fat lady i flew it out of
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:08.780]  mina i threw the fat lady in to get it sealed i helped set up the camera to photo that's gone
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:14.700]  and then the central america i'm the shadow warrior that someone has written reference to when i was
[02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:21.660]  when my dossier was classed by top c i'm a cia operative field operative but i'm one step beyond
[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:29.180]  that i'm also in the pentagon with a crew known as deterring guards now i've said it i've told me
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:33.580]  you can't say that you're going to go to jail for saying that okay i'm saying it to you alex i'm
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:39.980]  saying it right on your program if it's just as solid as i said i don't know how else to say it
[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:44.060]  we are involved in an international gun-running operation
[02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:51.820]  then gossie came up and i'm not going to have our political people turn their sense of political
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:57.180]  pain by saying that i have coming out here to praise the thin god's question so that
[02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:03.580]  hillary so that i destroyed the possibility of hillary clinton's running for the office of the
[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:10.220]  president that is bullshit oh that is not my motive my motive is to get to the most people
[02:07:10.220 --> 02:07:16.460]  that you're being stolen from our tax dollars are going down the drain i'm not taking an issue
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:22.140]  i'm not a radical but you know tell me what you want but the point is the reality of it
[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:28.620]  is that this has been a slow coup the reality is openly giving al-qaeda heat seeking missiles
[02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:33.660]  is too much for you and you're not going to be part of it no i'm not going to be part of it
[02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:39.020]  i was i was i was i talked to a couple c-130 pilots that have pissed off they're still military
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:42.860]  they can't talk like they're doing they say my god you won't believe i just got re-fueled
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:48.700]  air to air re-fueling in order to get weapons from the direct commercial sales officer to the
[02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:55.020]  middle east and stored them at a safe house in georgia a cia safe house in georgia has to stand
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:01.580]  that's broke out a little bit a few months ago and the gatekeepers immediately squashed it
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:07.020]  also back to gary hart gary hart wrote a letter to the senate on service committee and the senate
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:14.380]  intelligence committee he released all the maps he released all the those the flight plan to bill
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:19.260]  holding his security advisor all of them went to the senate on service committee and the senate
[02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:24.220]  intelligence committee he wrote a letter sent it back to me i posted on the internet the last
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:30.140]  paragraph that letter says they failed to investigate any of it because they had already
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:35.660]  known about it it was a sanctioned operation it was a secret operation well now they buy that
[02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:41.740]  our senate and our congress already knew about it but they didn't tell the american people about it
[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:45.660]  and when gary hart wrote the letter asking for an investigation so that was it all
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:50.540]  these and i went to the man and said hey i want to get a congressional investigation into this
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:55.900]  because i'm running guns illegally to a southern front in violation of the bowland amendment
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:09:01.820]  what do i do mr senator i've done exactly what me as an american citizen was supposed to do
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:06.620]  i was supposed to contact my senator and sit down and expose an illegal operation
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:11.820]  at that point in time i was a government employee according to federal law it is my
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:18.140]  responsibility i'm not aware of any of these operations that involve taxpayer money it is my
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:23.820]  obligation to take that to my people by myself that's right your phone's breaking up but it is the
[02:09:23.820 --> 02:09:28.620]  law you're supposed to report illegal stuff but then they'll try to use some uh you know national
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:34.300]  security issue on you and now throw you in jail for 20 years not five and obama has prosecuted
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:38.060]  more people with that than any other president before him i want to go to some phone calls and
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:43.500]  skip this network break because this is so historical you're hearing a major cia contractor one of the
[02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:49.180]  most famous ones ever also with the deep cover pentagon uh he just gave the code name for that
[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:54.700]  and tosh plumley robert tosh plumley robert tosh plumley is his facebook we have the information
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:10:01.660]  mirrored at infall wars dot com this is infall wars and we saw the military by the thousands
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:07.740]  including officers holding up over their face in uniform last year signs saying i will not
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:14.940]  attack syria for al qaeda and so i think they went too far trying to openly arm al qaeda and that's
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:20.140]  what ben gazi was all about and so tosh plumley is blowing it all wide open and explaining what it's
[02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:23.740]  really all about tosh i want to go to phone calls here because we're only going to the bottom of the
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:30.060]  hour and i appreciate your time we're going to go to lee and shan and gg and raymond and carlos
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:35.660]  so be ready callers with your question with your phone ready but before i go any further just briefly
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:40.940]  well you could just prove the state department knew and that and that and that ben gazi with your
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:45.740]  sources and your questions was part of this program so they knew and it wasn't really a
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:51.100]  embassy substation that's come out from other military sources black colonel schaefer and
[02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:56.300]  boy they came down on him when he came on this show and he had to kind of backtrack some but
[02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:02.860]  expanding on that what happened was it a rogue group stealing the weapons did the ambassador not go
[02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:09.180]  along with it were they planning a fake kidnapping as a new uh diversion hostage crisis for obama
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:13.020]  because we know the al-qaeda force running the city of ben gazi what was the hired state
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:19.100]  department security what are you being told really happened at ben gazi okay what started all this
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:24.460]  was uh a source of iron that's in the mind um uh the transfer from the past force so operating in
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:30.380]  niscoe to afghanistan and then it was attached to a nato field command in that process from nato
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:35.980]  field command he turned out about finding weapons or uh u.s weapons being stashed at annex buildings
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:43.980]  and also in place houses in jordan and back of town uh they were trying to leak out um then when
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:52.060]  those weapons were stolen or filth-rated then they started showing up and not stirring the
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:57.980]  rebels but in various different groups those were these weapons started our grenades rpt
[02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:05.020]  launchers grenade launchers all this stuff started showing up in other hands it was before
[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:09.580]  sort of before the rebels you know the whatever you call the rebel the serious rebels but
[02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:15.260]  before we were even trying to arm so and then here's the here's the thing this was what my
[02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:21.740]  source told me and this is what motivated me ambassador stevens found out about this he made
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:28.860]  a complaint in writing back to the state department complaining about the proof of the weapons and how
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:35.820]  and why was these weapons getting into these people's hands there's dispatches to that there's
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:43.420]  more than one memo state department is putting on those memos now just recently first state department
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:49.100]  says oh no he's full of crap we don't have nothing like that same thing they told them all we don't
[02:12:49.100 --> 02:12:55.260]  have any documentation and then that's a push push push push for answers on this Benghazi thing they
[02:12:55.260 --> 02:13:02.860]  finally come out with emails that shows that they actually knew every damn thing about those weapons
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:07.580]  even to the extent of how those weapons were being built up well let me stop you're right there
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:12.700]  out of all the things i just threw out that i brought that up to colonel shaffer weeks after
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:17.260]  it happened he said that's the word it was a hit to take out stevens he got in a bunch of trouble
[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:21.900]  so he said i'm just saying somebody it was a planned hit the point is that's the best intel
[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:30.780]  well we know the weapons were for al-qaeda we know the the the ambassador from turkey was there
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:34.620]  they were supposed to ship them up there we know turkey's been the main conduit along with
[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:39.900]  saudi arabia it's all confirmed so they wanted to take stevens out because he was going to end
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:46.060]  up testifying to congress and then when the navy seals didn't stand down the sheep dipped cia former
[02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:52.620]  navy seals came and two of them held down the al-qaeda force uh for those six seven hours
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:57.900]  that gave it time for the overhead drones to see what was happening so the military found out there
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:03.180]  was a stand down so al-qaeda could kill everybody at the base and they tried to kill everybody else
[02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:08.620]  that fled uh who got tipped off at checkpoints as well but the whole thing because it was badly
[02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:16.940]  managed leaks out and blew up in obama's face well that's that's about the size of it uh my
[02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:22.220]  information came coincides with that information i would this has been vetted from many many
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:27.500]  different sources but at the time when the ben gus the questions were arranged they said they were
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:32.300]  all crazy there was nothing to these questions but yet they refused to answer i would just like
[02:14:32.300 --> 02:14:38.860]  to take one of those questions and ask the rector have someone that has access to photos
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:46.060]  ask him just one of these questions get it on the record what does he have to say about that
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:54.220]  question yes or no very simple answer yes or no there's 11 questions posted up there it's been
[02:14:54.220 --> 02:15:02.780]  all over the internet since december why are these people we refuse to answer those questions those
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:10.460]  questions are not that complicated they're very simple now ben gus we lost four good people
[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:18.220]  because of our intelligence that doesn't mean that we have a bad intelligence network it means
[02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:25.500]  that we have gatekeepers that have infiltrated those networks instigated by our own political
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:30.620]  structure right as i'm going to explain and that basically makes the country blind in the end
[02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:35.900]  having all these triple agents of corporate interest inside government these people the biggest
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:42.460]  threat that's it in other words this has been on a slow coup like i say it's been ongoing for years
[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:48.380]  this didn't happen overnight that was we have been infiltrating people call them cia call them
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:53.660]  whatever i say there's one group of beyond cia others i don't blame the cia for all this there
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:59.020]  are damn good people in the cia but they can't get past those gatekeepers they can't get past those
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:06.620]  uh uh non qualified gatekeepers that are put in those positions by the politics of the time
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:15.740]  whether it be bush era clinton era or obama era it's the ever this is over who is the man behind
[02:16:15.740 --> 02:16:22.140]  the curtain who's pulling the string who is in charge of this international gun running operation
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:28.220]  is there an international gun running operation going ongoing today all i'm asking is for the
[02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:34.460]  american people get off their couch go out check out research investigate all right come to your
[02:16:34.460 --> 02:16:39.820]  own conclusion powerful powerful insider knowledge the secret of ben gazi released and confirmed
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:44.620]  here on air we're risking our lives to bring you this information especially tosh pray for us to
[02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:52.060]  sit in the game lee in ontario canada thanks for holding her on the year hi alex tosh uh
[02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:57.020]  okay alex to me it looks like exactly what you were talking about yesterday with the gaslight this
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:03.260]  administration is so good at gaslighting all these scandals and let's face it they've had their own
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:08.540]  share of scandals and gaslighting is something they've gotten really good at uh tosh you've been
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:13.660]  around for i think you were born in 1937 so you've been around through a few administrations
[02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:18.060]  seems like uh the people at the top they never really changed the motives don't change
[02:17:18.060 --> 02:17:24.620]  it seems like uh the american public now i wouldn't know because i'm 20 28 years old but um it seems
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:31.100]  like generations they have changed drastically while the people at the top haven't changed what
[02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:36.140]  makes it in this generation do you think this generation with all these scandals and the fact
[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:41.900]  that we've really done nothing about them or don't seem too interested in it do you think
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:47.660]  we have the capability of peacefully assembling and and and doing something about it absolutely
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:54.060]  tosh uh the same question what do we do about it all right yeah okay yes we do have the ability
[02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:58.700]  that's the reason although it's time for uh if you want to call it a rebel rousing or what the
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:03.500]  heck ever you call it you've got to do something to motivate this younger generation because the
[02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:07.900]  older generation has already contaminated they're so bad that they themselves cannot
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:13.820]  untangle it i would we are so indebted uh through some of these politicians that we have put in
[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:19.260]  there and they're lobbyists and they're cloning and they're the ones that we've got to get rid of
[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:24.780]  here's the problem we've got a congress and we've got a senate that is totally contaminated
[02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:31.580]  with gatekeepers that we have put in position ourselves during these elections i don't know
[02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:36.460]  if these elections are real or not i'm not going to get off on theory the point is this
[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:44.140]  infiltration has started over the years and then migrated to where it is today i would
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:51.500]  the people that are really for the constitution and love their country and work for the government
[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:56.860]  can't do their job because that when they find out something that's derogatory against
[02:18:56.860 --> 02:19:03.100]  putting politics in then they are not that's right so we need more people in the system and outside
[02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:08.060]  the system to speak out have a moral revival that's the answer and tosh plumbly is leading it with
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:13.820]  this courage shan get a march hey get a march on dc like we did in the 60s in other words then
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:18.780]  everybody's together that wants to save this constitution and i don't mean be radical and i
[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:23.100]  don't mean be a non-peaceful i don't mean go and threaten and i don't mean get a bunch of armed
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:27.900]  militia showing up for and going to everybody that's not the way to do it the way to do it is
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:32.780]  get a combined effort to make a march on washington demand sure sure and and support broadcast to
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:36.460]  tell the truth and whistleblowers all right shon and pencil venue you're on the air what's your
[02:19:36.460 --> 02:19:45.020]  question man these phones are too bad i appreciate your call and you know i just figured something
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:51.100]  out when we take phone calls here they're better i'm going to go to our system jenesis phone system
[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:56.220]  is degrading i know it had problems last week and the callers have bad call phones as well
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:20:00.460]  but it is just unintelligible half the time so if you hear a caller who you can understand their
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:07.260]  phone jenesis they can't come on as a caller uh remone in florida i'm getting spiked all over
[02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:12.300]  my phone here so i don't know where that's oh who knows we go ahead remone in florida you're on the
[02:20:12.300 --> 02:20:19.180]  air go ahead am i intelligible sir yes go ahead ask your question all right first things first um
[02:20:19.820 --> 02:20:25.260]  you were involved in the iran conscious scandal mr plumley and obviously the black community was
[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:30.140]  affected most by you know the crack epidemic and in these situations so i wanted to know your opinion
[02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:35.740]  on how can i get my people more involved and more get them to understand better that did all these
[02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:42.140]  problems affect all of us it's not just a white thing it's not just uh uh climbing bundy thing it's a
[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:46.700]  everyone thing we should all rally around one another one we see these situations happening
[02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:51.900]  where you know people are getting taken advantage of and what's your opinion on how we can unite
[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:56.540]  because the last caller touched on it but my community is most affected by this because they
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:01.020]  don't have the knowledge they haven't been taught all these situations like the iran contra
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:05.820]  now that's a great question tosh and tosh don't americans have to come together regardless of race
[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:12.060]  religion or creed for freedom yeah definitely definitely uh uh look that's one of the ways
[02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:17.020]  that they destroy the credibility of people that do the research and come forward they
[02:21:17.020 --> 02:21:22.780]  lace those things of race card against them i'm sorry mr bundy said the same thing that he said
[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:29.340]  you know but there again uh that's no reason to put the emphasis on race and then you know
[02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:34.540]  blah blah blah and forget what the real problem is i'm not saying i don't want to know i totally
[02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:39.740]  understand they're diverting with little issues while the the government shipping and the narcotics
[02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:44.380]  and laundering and they're setting up checkpoints on the highway looking for drugs they shipped in

[02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:55.900]  but this is the real world i mean toss pummeling is a famous two-time whistleblower
[02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:01.820]  that's really out of the pentagon you you heard him give out secret information on air
[02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:07.340]  praetorian guard pentagon groups those are guys that have been in there forever
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:14.140]  and just basically say we're not going to give missiles to al qaeda
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:21.740]  that's how out of control this criminal group is that they think you're so stupid
[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:25.580]  that they'll give weapons to al qaeda to blow up churches
[02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:32.460]  and it does show that the moral evil has gotten so out of control
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:36.460]  that people are now risking their lives to tell you the truth
[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:49.740]  the ap is now reporting that you know back in 1985 us provides 500 000 so afghan rebels can
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:56.220]  tell their story and then see on 9 11 a group of them were protected to be involved in what they
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:27:01.660]  were involved in and then saudi arabia when al qaeda took the blame for what they were involved
[02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:07.580]  in but slowly took the blame then they get rewarded with the whole middle east later
[02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:12.140]  this deal was made a long time ago it transcends obama it transcends these groups
[02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:20.460]  believe me i study this stuff 24 7 we told you within days what ben gazi was a hit when you
[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:24.780]  got almost an eight hour stand down while they try to kill four people in a building
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:34.620]  and they tell you the white house didn't know about it they gave the order to kill those people
[02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:40.860]  and that's what i've said day one we know they're lying about it we know it was a gun
[02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:45.020]  running operation we know they had three warehouses full of weapons we know the ambassador from
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:49.580]  turkey was there we now know that al qaeda launched chemical attacks on syria to blame them
[02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:56.700]  it's all come out it's in mainstream turkish news and the bbc even that turkey ran false flags
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:03.020]  to blame syria again this year and it's the defense minister with the top general
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:07.180]  and the defense minister is going you know i really like maybe a terror attack like this or
[02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:11.660]  maybe an attack on our bases like that and the general goes man look we do that all the time
[02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:15.420]  stop talking about it over the phone you read the transcript we know what to do
[02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:20.300]  and obviously the russians are there they've got their own systems stealing all those communications
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:26.140]  and the general we read the stuff two weeks going air is like a minister stop talking about it
[02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:29.420]  just say you want it we know what to do we do this all the time
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:37.580]  there's the headline why turkey was planning a false flag operation syria that's info wars.com
[02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:40.860]  wrote about it that's zero hedge but it was also in the bbc
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:46.780]  and now it comes out and the public doesn't even know what that is
[02:28:47.900 --> 02:28:51.820]  but it's so funny reading the transcript and the audio was released i just don't speak turkish
[02:28:52.540 --> 02:28:59.260]  and he's going maybe you bomb our base maybe you blow up hotel maybe you attack this maybe you
[02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:04.140]  attack that maybe you hit our troops and the general is like we know what to do yes just tell
[02:29:04.140 --> 02:29:13.900]  us to do it we'll do something we've got plans i told you one of the first things wiki leaks
[02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:19.500]  released in a group of documents back in uh i don't know it's like three four years ago

[02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:38.540]  yeah i came out in 2008 why don't just read the read the read the page i'm just so
[02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:40.620]  run off my memory not even the document there it is
[02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:51.580]  and uh there they are telling folks about how they're going to be sent for special classes
[02:30:53.500 --> 02:30:56.620]  and they go on to say we've learned about running death squads and
[02:30:57.180 --> 02:31:01.500]  propping up corrupt governments in latin america but how do we keep that in place
[02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:08.780]  the document which is official u.s special forces policy directly advocates training
[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:15.100]  paramilitaries pervasive surveillance to look at america censorship press control restrictions on
[02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:20.860]  labor unions and political parties suspending habeas corpus hatred act warrantless searches
[02:31:21.580 --> 02:31:27.900]  detainment without charge india a bribery employing terrorist false flag operations
[02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:33.740]  concealing human rights abuses from journalists and extensive use of psychological operations
[02:31:33.740 --> 02:31:39.820]  propaganda to make these another population and resource control measures palatable that's what
[02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:47.420]  it's called population and resource control we are the human resource but not all of the special
[02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:53.260]  forces officers get these those psychologically tracked traced tested and shown that they want to
[02:31:53.260 --> 02:32:06.540]  be winners are taught how to win and let me tell you how you win you grab a little boy in the village
[02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:12.540]  and you torture him and put cigarettes out over him and electrocute him and then you pull up in a
[02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:18.060]  car when you know people are walking to work or wherever from the village and you act like they
[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:23.340]  catch you throwing the body out in the uniforms of your enemies that's a simple one and you can
[02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:30.460]  kill one little kid and get the whole town on your side now men do you do that to save the
[02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:35.340]  whole region from corruption and do not have to have a full-scale war that could kill hundreds of
[02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:44.460]  thousands or do you kill the one little boy per town the end justifies the means macchiavelli
[02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:48.140]  and you've been chosen because you've shown your will to do what it takes to win for good
[02:32:49.660 --> 02:32:56.220]  see that's the whole apocalypse now colonel curtz deal where he talks about they come in
[02:32:56.220 --> 02:33:06.540]  and inoculate the special forces the vietnamese kids and show the regular vietcong military comes
[02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:12.460]  along and chops off all the arms of the inoculation of course the story is it's a good inoculation
[02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:18.380]  so you know but but still don't take anything from the gis or we're going to cut your arm off
[02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:22.540]  and he says they weren't bad men they weren't evil men they were trained cadres they
[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:27.500]  they had women and children they were married they did it they were loving men
[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:34.140]  it was he hit me like a diamond bullet that this is what we have to build this is what we have to do
[02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:40.940]  and the other special forces killer that's been sent to kill him realizes he's completely insane
[02:33:40.940 --> 02:33:47.660]  no the colonel curtz is not insane according to the real strategies that were employed in vietnam
[02:33:53.340 --> 02:33:56.380]  and i'm telling you you don't win wars like this ladies and gentlemen
[02:33:57.740 --> 02:34:04.540]  but you wouldn't be in an immoral war if you were moral you have to have the moral high ground to
[02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:09.900]  win wars and then even if you don't have the good weapons history shows you cannot be defeated long
[02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:17.580]  term that's why the globalist all day talk about how their moral and their good and their great
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:21.900]  and they care and they've got all the answers and you're bad and you're racist and you're this and
[02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:29.740]  that because they need the moral high ground the attacks we suffer constantly are that i'm not moral
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:33.500]  and i'm fake and i'm this and that because the government listens to my phones and tracks me they
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:40.780]  know i'm completely real and fearless and committed do i eat too much sometimes sometimes under stress
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:45.900]  do i drink too much sure everybody's human do i go years sometimes without drinking a beer yes
[02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:52.620]  and i don't even smoke cigars anymore but when it comes to being moral i'm extremely moral compared
[02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:59.100]  to most people i'm very moral i won't cheat people i pay my crew i don't mean most people in entertainment
[02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:04.140]  industry as they would call this i'm not in entertainment but that's what it's genre news media
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:08.700]  almost everybody that works for history and discovery channel all these things now work for
[02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:14.060]  free even establishment camera people that have been working 20 30 years have to work a lot of
[02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:19.820]  time for free or or almost nothing just to stay in the industry because they don't understand that
[02:35:19.820 --> 02:35:27.100]  they all sold themselves out so cheap there's a glut now and i get calls all the time and they go
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:33.420]  go you want to be on our tv show and i go yeah 20 000
[02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:42.620]  but we don't pay people well good you're not gonna talk to me boom and it's not even about the money
[02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:49.260]  it's about these whores and the mainstream media are going to pay me pay up you understand that
[02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:53.740]  and i'm going to use that money back against you i don't play your little stinking games
[02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:58.620]  i give the good people of america the best products the lowest prices we can bring you
[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:04.780]  that i personally vetted news we fund ourselves off goodwill and off of being honorable and high
[02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:09.020]  quality when it comes to the establishment sometimes they offer me money and i say i'm just
[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:13.340]  not going to do it well we are the such as such you know new york times you don't want to come
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:18.140]  down to your offices i say no once you can act like your journalist and act like you found out who
[02:36:18.140 --> 02:36:25.980]  i really am i've already learned that lesson i don't do it anymore i'm not bragging here i'm
[02:36:25.980 --> 02:36:31.980]  just telling everybody hollywood and the whole culture has nothing to offer i've been in big
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:38.060]  movies i've been at the big parties i've been on the boats and the private jets i've seen it all
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:44.860]  i've been at the highest mountains of crap and let me tell you all of you that feel inadequate
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:48.700]  believe in this system or scare what your neighbor thinks about you or don't feel good because your
[02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:56.380]  car isn't the nicest none of that means anything what matters is what you stand for what matters
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:37:02.620]  is who you really are and the system knows that they don't have the moral high ground and finally
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:08.220]  our military and the cia and everybody else most these guys really believe they're good guys most
[02:37:08.220 --> 02:37:14.060]  these guys really believe at least in the past that they were trying to do good you'd have small
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:18.220]  criminal networks at the top that manipulated everybody and that was what they were masters of
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:26.140]  was deceiving people now the cia doesn't want the top of the class the cia doesn't want the athlete
[02:37:26.140 --> 02:37:32.700]  star quarterback the cia doesn't want the person that's never stolen or been in trouble they just
[02:37:32.700 --> 02:37:38.220]  want a bunch of political operatives to go around and lie and spy on people it's a bunch of wimps
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:45.100]  the cia's basically gotten 20 times bigger the last decade i'm being serious with with suboperatives
[02:37:45.100 --> 02:37:49.980]  just everywhere they've never been shot at they've never been in fistfights they've never been in the
[02:37:49.980 --> 02:37:56.700]  jungle they've they have never killed anybody they don't know anything and they're all going to manage
[02:37:56.700 --> 02:38:03.820]  the military and the paramilitary and the the contractors and they're going to be your political
[02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:10.300]  officers literal snot nose 30 year olds who've never done anything who've got iv league educations
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:18.300]  they're going to sit around and literally urinate on you we are ruled by a bunch of degenerate
[02:38:18.300 --> 02:38:24.300]  inbred nobodies the white shoe boys that gerald salento talks about and here's the deal you white
[02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:29.740]  shoe boys can't run a murder of the ambassador properly can you you can't even do evil well
[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:36.300]  evil well scum you are a joke and a liability to this country at every level and what i'm saying
[02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:43.500]  by that is everything's going to collapse notice how our military and police now dress like third
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:49.340]  world dictators the most serious militaries were the most simple uniforms you know a country's
[02:38:49.340 --> 02:38:55.340]  in decline when people are wearing clown suits i mean i didn't know most police chiefs were were
[02:38:55.340 --> 02:39:03.100]  auditioning for hollywoods to play the part of a mexican general or or or or some kind of you know
[02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:10.780]  clown outfit like muhammad qaddafi you people are a joke what i think the israelis were the most
[02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:16.380]  simple uniforms everyone's ever had because everyone knows that clowns wear big suits and
[02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:25.340]  suits and outfits i just cannot handle it i mean i'm sitting there the night out with friends

[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:19.180]  you're part of the ruling elite you people are opening the drawbridge to our destruction
[02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:23.740]  you're not even opening the drawbridge to some foreign power that's better
[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:30.540]  you're opening the drawbridge to the end of everything good and you think you're cool because

[02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:41.580]  years ago they'll quit if we just cut their pay but if we make them an associate editor
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:48.620]  they will literally take a 70 cut to say they're the editor of texas monthly

[02:52:53.260 --> 02:52:58.300]  high satanic holy day i'm gonna cover it later yeah that kicked me out man when i heard about that i
[02:52:58.300 --> 02:53:02.220]  was like oh man are you serious why are you being bigoted against burning the children
[02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:10.140]  part of a culture they had a shooting over here not too long ago uh andy lopez the uh the 12-year-old
[02:53:10.140 --> 02:53:17.180]  hispanic uh shot here in santa rosa and uh they also had oscar grand and thomas kelly you know
[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:22.620]  you know it's like uh they're trying to divide the people but the government doesn't really care
[02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:26.220]  you know what really color you are they're just trying to use races though you know what i mean
[02:53:26.220 --> 02:53:30.220]  yeah i haven't played that video yet of the cops shooting someone running out of a
[02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:34.940]  was it a walmart or a target with with something they stole so they shoot them in the back three
[02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:39.820]  or four times we have that video yeah yeah we can roll that right now just to show tv viewers
[02:53:39.820 --> 02:53:44.300]  uh but that was in long beach and i tell you it's getting scary i mean we get treated worse
[02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:52.060]  in folks in fallujah oh man you know i was wondering the people out here are looking for justice and
[02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:57.180]  i was thinking you know i'm like the reason why nobody's getting any justice out here is because
[02:53:57.180 --> 02:54:02.700]  uh the nsa is breathing down their neck and i'm wondering if we'll see the see see see pholcalt
[02:54:02.700 --> 02:54:06.620]  wrote about this but france had something called the panoptagon and it was a tower in the middle
[02:54:06.620 --> 02:54:10.860]  of a circular prison where you felt like you were always being watched by the guards so you
[02:54:10.860 --> 02:54:16.780]  self-censored the average is culturally run down the street naked i don't mean literally do that
[02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:21.260]  stop tearing though i know you're listening criminals and it's illegal and i don't like it
[02:54:21.260 --> 02:54:25.980]  but you're not going to make me self-censor i'm going to get in your dirty face and get aggressive
[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:33.100]  thanks for the call alvin alvin you're on the air and yes sir from kinetica go ahead hi thanks
[02:54:33.100 --> 02:54:37.580]  for taking my call and i enjoy your show very much thank you cold cold in a couple of weeks ago
[02:54:37.580 --> 02:54:42.300]  when doug and joe hagman's were on it but you had to leave early but i wanted to ask you several
[02:54:42.300 --> 02:54:47.260]  of us have noticed that there has been an increase in the number of elites and leaders that are
[02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:53.020]  looking much older tired getting sick mentally and physically even dying we're even seeing that with
[02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:58.940]  some of their family members we're wondering if this is almost like a little divine intervention
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:03.100]  starting almost like the scriptures with Passover almost where the good lord is starting to move
[02:55:03.100 --> 02:55:09.340]  against the folks creating the largest amount of evil no no no we should pray that just like
[02:55:09.340 --> 02:55:15.580]  plagues came against egypt and yes we should pray against the globalists that god bring justice upon
[02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:20.140]  them are you seeing that are you guys tracking that in your in your studio because if that's the
[02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:25.420]  no no the evil evil leaders are always incredibly unhappy hitler had all these diseases and problems
[02:55:25.420 --> 02:55:30.620]  degenerated just during the war uh i mean they all look horrible they're horribly unhappy scum
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:35.260]  that's why they want to make us unhappy do you think that that's going to continue and if it does
[02:55:35.260 --> 02:55:39.900]  isn't that an indication from above that the good lord is making his move on these folks and well
[02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:44.540]  this is the way providence works and it's been proven historically george washoe name it we
[02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:50.060]  have courage we do the right thing we stand up god will take us the rest of the way so the more
[02:55:50.060 --> 02:55:55.740]  the more we put more exactly that that's a good that's a good sign i think it's something you
[02:55:55.740 --> 02:55:59.260]  guys might want to track because we're seeing it in the news i'm not going to name names what we're
[02:55:59.260 --> 02:56:03.580]  seeing is uh just in the last three four five months maybe there's some indications there that's
[02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:07.660]  something uh you know big is happening you know and it's more surgical than just some kind of a
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:15.340]  nuclear war you know that would be great you know if that could happen well no i do pray that uh the
[02:56:15.340 --> 02:56:21.980]  the globalists reprint wake up and stop doing evil or that god bring judgment upon them uh so
[02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:27.500]  that's exactly that's the fact do you think that's starting to happen in both ways right now conversion
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:31.580]  because they're looking internally in their souls and and i'll put the same time maybe the lord is
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:36.140]  taking it taking it pushing it a little further now i know there's a huge awakening happening but
[02:56:36.140 --> 02:56:40.460]  also a lot of evil eyes just a big battle's about to happen i'm sorry to truth raider i'm out of
[02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:45.260]  time great job to the crew great job to everybody out there the folks up at genesis all of our
