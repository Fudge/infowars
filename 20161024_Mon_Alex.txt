[00:00.000 --> 00:08.200]  We're only 14 days down from the election, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08.200 --> 00:09.400]  I'm your host, Alex Shoves.
[00:09.400 --> 00:11.360]  This is a big broadcast today.
[00:11.360 --> 00:12.360]  Stay with us.
[00:12.360 --> 00:15.840]  Charles Cowleson, in studio and more, but first a John Bound report.
[00:15.840 --> 00:21.040]  With President Barack Obama's last 100 days ticking down and the finish line in sight,
[00:21.040 --> 00:26.840]  both Trump and Clinton have described what each of their first 100 days as the next
[00:26.840 --> 00:29.960]  president of the United States will look like.
[00:29.960 --> 00:36.440]  I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you
[00:36.440 --> 00:39.480]  and for your families across our country.
[00:39.480 --> 00:45.840]  I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put dreamers,
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.520]  including those with us today, at risk of deportation.
[00:50.520 --> 00:56.160]  And if Congress continues to refuse to act as president, I would do everything possible
[00:56.160 --> 00:59.400]  under the law to go even further.
[00:59.400 --> 01:04.040]  All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.
[01:04.040 --> 01:05.440]  We will be very careful.
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.840]  Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.240]  and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration.
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.760]  Middle class tax relief and simplification act.
[01:20.760 --> 01:27.400]  An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million
[01:27.400 --> 01:34.240]  new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification in combination with trade reform,
[01:34.240 --> 01:39.360]  regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy.
[01:39.360 --> 01:46.720]  Middle class with family of two children will get basically approximately a 35% tax cut,
[01:46.720 --> 01:51.200]  and that's what they can use, and that money will go back into the economy.
[01:51.200 --> 01:58.440]  The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be
[01:58.440 --> 02:00.680]  greatly simplified.
[02:00.680 --> 02:06.760]  Meanwhile, Hillary Henschman, Obama, Madeline Albright, and Joe Biden continue to take cheap
[02:06.760 --> 02:12.640]  shots at Trump, whipping the Democratic base into an enraged mob capable of random acts
[02:12.640 --> 02:13.640]  of violence.
[02:13.640 --> 02:21.080]  It has just been learned on video that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like
[02:21.080 --> 02:28.200]  in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt, you saw that blood pouring
[02:28.200 --> 02:37.600]  down their face, were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.
[02:37.600 --> 02:48.920]  I have never seen in my lifetime any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections
[02:48.920 --> 02:53.400]  and the election process before votes have even taken place.
[02:53.400 --> 02:58.920]  I have never seen anybody that is less equipped to talk about national security policy than
[02:58.920 --> 02:59.920]  Donald Trump.
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.600]  We have heard that a half a million children have died, you know, is the price worth it?
[03:05.600 --> 03:10.600]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price we think the price is worth it.
[03:10.600 --> 03:22.080]  He said, because I'm famous, because I'm a star, because I'm a billionaire, I can do
[03:22.080 --> 03:27.120]  things other people can.
[03:27.120 --> 03:32.080]  What a disgusting assertion for anyone to make.
[03:32.080 --> 03:46.880]  While American voters can't escape the consolidating mainstream media that has unanimously declared
[03:46.880 --> 03:52.400]  Hillary the victor, regardless that polls show the popular vote could go either way.
[03:52.400 --> 03:53.400]  They know it.
[03:53.400 --> 03:54.400]  Everybody knows it.
[03:54.400 --> 04:11.000]  Over the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place.
[04:11.000 --> 04:18.640]  And one of those pollsters was the most accurate poll on the last two cycles, but the media
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.360]  refuses to even say it or put that word out.
[04:24.360 --> 04:26.080]  They refuse to talk about it.
[04:26.080 --> 04:33.080]  They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people.
[04:33.080 --> 04:38.680]  As Hillary sets her campaign on cruise control, and Trump continues to blaze down a path trying
[04:38.680 --> 04:44.360]  to relate to millions of undecided American voters that have to decide between a globalist
[04:44.360 --> 04:51.360]  endgame and a fuming populism that is breathing down the planet's neck, John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[05:44.360 --> 05:49.560]  The McCullough is also presently under investigation by the FBI's Washington Field Office regarding
[05:49.560 --> 05:54.400]  a probe that includes donations made on behalf of Chinese businessman Wang Wenliang.
[05:54.400 --> 05:58.920]  While Trump pointed out perhaps it's time to drain the swamp in Washington, I'm Margaret
[05:58.920 --> 06:28.840]  Halver, reporting for Infowars.com.
[06:58.920 --> 07:04.760]  At 44541, Alex Now, a clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[07:04.760 --> 07:10.040]  Deep Cleanse by InfowarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites
[07:10.040 --> 07:14.120]  and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[07:14.120 --> 07:18.280]  Using on proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanse are most affordable
[07:18.280 --> 07:19.360]  all-in-one cleanser.

[07:25.840 --> 07:26.840]  and others.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.960]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back.
[07:28.960 --> 07:33.840]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific

[07:58.000 --> 08:17.800]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:17.800 --> 08:24.320]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[08:24.320 --> 08:32.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're now only two weeks or 14 days to be precise from undoubtedly
[08:38.840 --> 08:42.200]  the most historic election in modern world history.
[08:42.200 --> 08:48.200]  And it's definitely up there, one of the most important elections in all of the United
[08:48.200 --> 08:52.440]  States history, all 242 years.
[08:52.440 --> 08:55.880]  It is Monday, the 24th day of October 2016.
[08:55.880 --> 08:57.960]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[08:57.960 --> 09:01.760]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[09:01.760 --> 09:09.040]  We have former Marine Corps officer and naval aviator, Joel Scowze, joining us in studio.
[09:09.040 --> 09:10.920]  We talk about World Affairs.
[09:10.920 --> 09:13.120]  He's the editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief.
[09:13.120 --> 09:16.320]  That's in the second hour, but he's also here to tape a special report for us that will
[09:16.320 --> 09:21.040]  be a month or two probably in the making, dealing with real preparedness, because you
[09:21.040 --> 09:25.880]  see all these bomb shelter redoubts being built in Hollywood and New York and places
[09:25.880 --> 09:30.280]  like that, New York City, Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, they're a joke.
[09:30.280 --> 09:31.280]  They're a death trap.
[09:31.280 --> 09:36.200]  There's a larger issue though of why are the elite taking the money and running to New
[09:36.200 --> 09:45.920]  Zealand and other areas of the world or to the Caribbean and building armored fortresses?
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.200]  Because if you understand that, you understand the big picture and you understand exactly
[09:49.200 --> 09:53.320]  what's coming, so all of that is coming up today.
[09:53.320 --> 10:00.160]  Bottom line, the world's social engineers believe that the planet's current course is unsustainable.
[10:00.160 --> 10:06.920]  So they have decided to grease the skids towards a controlled demolition of the world economy
[10:06.920 --> 10:12.560]  and culture, the controlled demolition of civilization.
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.480]  So we're not here predicting the fall.
[10:17.480 --> 10:21.320]  We know they're engineering the fall and we're trying to stop it.
[10:21.320 --> 10:25.800]  That's why everything we talk about basically ends up happening, not because we predicted
[10:25.800 --> 10:30.600]  it, but because it's part of a global program.
[10:30.600 --> 10:34.800]  Self-driving cars, told you they'd try to take all of our cars away, taxed by the mile
[10:34.800 --> 10:39.320]  and enforced us into the self-driving cars 20 years ago because that was coming out of
[10:39.320 --> 10:43.280]  MIT and the big think tanks, now it's here.
[10:43.280 --> 10:48.400]  We told you they'd dissolve the borders because that's in the TPP, that's in the NAU, that's
[10:48.400 --> 10:55.000]  in the Trans-Pacific and Regional and Atlantic Partnership mergers.
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.760]  We're here chronicling the globalist plan and they can't have their cake and eat it
[10:59.760 --> 11:00.760]  too.
[11:00.760 --> 11:03.280]  They can't deny there's a world government, deny there's a corporate plan and all the
[11:03.280 --> 11:07.560]  rest of it and then come out and promote a world government at the same time, but that's
[11:07.560 --> 11:08.560]  what they're doing.
[11:08.560 --> 11:14.000]  Just like they can't have Obamacare and claim it's free or you can keep your doctor when
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.440]  it's not.
[11:15.440 --> 11:19.800]  So the chickens are coming home to roost and people are really now being faced with the
[11:19.800 --> 11:24.240]  reality of what globalism truly stands for and the fact that Hillary Clinton has gotten
[11:24.240 --> 11:27.800]  more corporate contributions than any other candidate in history.
[11:27.800 --> 11:32.240]  Basically Trump's gotten zero and the entire global corrupt power structure is against
[11:32.240 --> 11:33.240]  Trump.
[11:33.240 --> 11:34.240]  What does that tell you?
[11:34.240 --> 11:36.680]  It tells me a lot.
[11:36.680 --> 11:40.200]  Jill Stein is back in the news, the head of the Green Party, a real liberal saying,
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.520]  I want to congratulate, she actually excoriates the Democrats for mastering the corporate
[11:45.520 --> 11:46.520]  realm.
[11:46.520 --> 11:50.760]  In fact, I'm looking at DrudgeReport.com with extremely powerful articles and information.
[11:50.760 --> 11:58.080]  Jill Stein excoriates Dems over mastery of corporate politics and right above that professor
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.560]  who predicted last five elections says Trump will win by 87 percent.
[12:02.560 --> 12:04.520]  Now he has an algorithm.
[12:04.520 --> 12:06.440]  He has a computer.
[12:06.440 --> 12:11.320]  When you go to the New York Times, they've got Hillary basically winning by a number
[12:11.320 --> 12:13.680]  even higher than that.
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.480]  And then they just said that it's some secret formulae that they've got.
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.560]  They say Hillary Clinton has a 92 percent chance to win.
[12:22.560 --> 12:25.760]  Trump has an 8 percent.
[12:25.760 --> 12:29.920]  And CNN is going with the same headline that they're now looking past Trump, okay, he's
[12:29.920 --> 12:32.120]  already lost two weeks out.
[12:32.120 --> 12:35.320]  They're totally rigging the election.
[12:35.320 --> 12:41.520]  And what's frustrating to me is they're now up to what Podesta leak number 16.
[12:41.520 --> 12:43.080]  And guess what's in the new one?
[12:43.080 --> 12:52.240]  It's right above it on DrudgeReport.com Podesta email exposes dim playbook for rigging through
[12:52.240 --> 12:53.240]  oversamples.
[12:53.240 --> 12:54.240]  Close quote.
[12:54.240 --> 13:01.200]  Now notice what I last year or so, how I've been telling you Hillary was cheating Bernie
[13:01.200 --> 13:07.160]  Sanders and now Trump with Bloomberg and Reuters and CNN and all the rest of them.
[13:07.160 --> 13:08.160]  How are they doing?
[13:08.160 --> 13:12.240]  Because they tell you in the methodology under it, normally six, seven pages of methodology
[13:12.240 --> 13:13.240]  you have to go read.
[13:13.240 --> 13:17.120]  But we've done articles and shown screenshots here pretty much every day for the last year
[13:17.120 --> 13:18.120]  or so.
[13:18.120 --> 13:19.120]  How do they do it?
[13:19.120 --> 13:20.120]  Oversampling.
[13:20.120 --> 13:25.280]  Now, zero hedge reports, and of course it says this in the memo from Podesta running
[13:25.280 --> 13:31.160]  the mainstream media in the polls basically, I mean they give the orders to CNN, ABC, MSNBC,
[13:31.160 --> 13:34.600]  CBS, they get daily orders, here's the talking point.
[13:34.600 --> 13:39.840]  That's why you tune into CBS or NBC or ABC or CNN, it's all the same story, in the same
[13:39.840 --> 13:40.840]  order.
[13:40.840 --> 13:45.320]  There's been thousands of those great superclip mashups showing the newscasters saying the
[13:45.320 --> 13:49.240]  same thing in the same order for all 30 minutes of the nightly news.
[13:49.240 --> 13:52.440]  This is what they do.
[13:52.440 --> 13:59.240]  But we have the email and on average they oversample 12 points.
[13:59.240 --> 14:03.960]  Now, I've seen them where they sample 50 something points more.
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.920]  They have these whoppers suckers where, oh look, she's going to win by 76 percent.
[14:08.920 --> 14:14.560]  Oh boy, wow, we've got a new ABC news poll where 60 something percent are for Hillary.
[14:14.560 --> 14:20.600]  We only sampled 30 something percent more Democrats, I mean, whoa, whoa.
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.600]  You talk about fraud land, there's always been some fraud.
[14:24.600 --> 14:29.200]  Generally they would go in and say, oh, independence, they were sampling 20 percent.
[14:29.200 --> 14:32.560]  Let's say, and then turns out 18 percent are really Democrats, they know that, but they're
[14:32.560 --> 14:35.640]  just saying that they're independents, and that's how they skew.
[14:35.640 --> 14:38.160]  They're not even doing that now.
[14:38.160 --> 14:43.760]  They're not even putting up the pretenses that this isn't total fraud, two plus two equals
[14:43.760 --> 14:45.000]  seven.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.720]  I mean, this is that ridiculous.
[14:47.720 --> 14:53.320]  If you sample 47 percent Democrats and 22 percent Republicans, this is one Reuters we've shown
[14:53.320 --> 14:58.160]  over and over again, and the rest is independents and they're mainly Democrats, well, of course
[14:58.160 --> 15:01.120]  Hillary's winning at 60 something percent.
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.320]  You do the math in those polls, she's actually 10, 15 points behind, which is what Trump's
[15:06.320 --> 15:07.480]  internal polling.
[15:07.480 --> 15:14.240]  He's got real pollsters, real polling agencies out there commissioning real private polls,
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.520]  and they show him in places like California, dead heat with Hillary.
[15:18.520 --> 15:20.800]  They show him in Florida, 15 points ahead.
[15:20.800 --> 15:25.760]  They show him in Ohio, beating her so bad, she quit going to Ohio for a while by 10,
[15:25.760 --> 15:27.280]  15 points.
[15:27.280 --> 15:31.920]  But not in the polls, CNN puts out, or Reuters or Bloomberg, and this is such a scandal.
[15:31.920 --> 15:36.800]  Forget Donald Trump, because nobody's perfect, but just remove it from the equation.
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.720]  The whole power structure, foreign governments, the Pope, every other corrupt institution,
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.960]  the communist Chinese are telling you, you can't have Donald Trump.
[15:44.960 --> 15:47.160]  You can't have Donald Trump.
[15:47.160 --> 15:48.360]  You can't have him.
[15:48.360 --> 15:49.360]  They've rigged everything.
[15:49.360 --> 15:53.160]  They've been caught, you know, turning his microphone off and turning it down and interrupting
[15:53.160 --> 15:58.320]  him 40 something times and 60 something times and her five or six times.
[15:58.320 --> 16:00.720]  It goes on and on.
[16:00.720 --> 16:04.200]  Total media warfare.
[16:04.200 --> 16:08.400]  Total to stay for the American people, and then meanwhile, New Podesta email exposes
[16:08.400 --> 16:15.320]  Playbook for rigging polls through oversamples, as if we need WikiLeaks to know this.
[16:15.320 --> 16:20.880]  This is not the first one about them oversampling, as if we need WikiLeaks to tell us that the
[16:20.880 --> 16:26.440]  head of the DNC was sabotaging Bernie Sanders, or that the lady she replaced her with, Donna
[16:26.440 --> 16:28.200]  Brazil, was doing the same thing.
[16:28.200 --> 16:32.720]  I mean, we already know that's the point, is it's completely transparent.
[16:32.720 --> 16:35.760]  So if they stole it from Bernie Sanders, will they steal it from Trump?
[16:35.760 --> 16:36.760]  Absolutely.
[16:36.760 --> 16:39.120]  Are they federalizing it to, quote, keep Trump from stealing it?
[16:39.120 --> 16:45.200]  Yes, but election fraud doesn't exist, but it does exist by Trump.
[16:45.200 --> 16:50.360]  So we've got to put together short informational videos that just show the sampling and just
[16:50.360 --> 16:54.560]  say, dear Democrats, Trump really is ahead 10 points conservatively.
[16:54.560 --> 16:56.560]  And that's why they're in full scale panic.
[16:56.560 --> 17:01.280]  You think that the owner of Amazon just went in even more money against Trump?
[17:01.280 --> 17:04.720]  You think the owner of Facebook went in even more against Trump?
[17:04.720 --> 17:08.600]  You think Google admits they're all in against Trump spending billions, basically, and off
[17:08.600 --> 17:12.360]  the books money and advertising on the web?
[17:12.360 --> 17:18.200]  I mean, we've never seen such a concerted worldwide effort because he's a nationalist.
[17:18.200 --> 17:22.680]  They know he's a nationalist, and their sweetheart deals of totally controlling Congress are
[17:22.680 --> 17:25.960]  at least going to be in question if he gets in.
[17:25.960 --> 17:29.800]  And by the way, there's no doubt with the New York Times calling for his death, there's
[17:29.800 --> 17:35.880]  no doubt, along the violence we've heard in the media, that they plan to kill him if he
[17:35.880 --> 17:36.880]  does get in.
[17:36.880 --> 17:42.320]  So don't think if Trump gets in, we've got peaches and cream out in front of us.
[17:42.320 --> 17:45.280]  The fight has just begun, but here it is.
[17:45.280 --> 17:48.720]  Like many of the recent polls from Reuters, ABC, and The Washington Post, the latest poll
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.520]  included a nine-point sampling bias towards registered Democrats, which is a low bias normally.
[17:54.520 --> 17:57.120]  A poll is thrown out of it as any bias.
[17:57.120 --> 18:01.200]  Earlier this morning, we wrote about the obvious sampling bias in the latest ABC-Washington
[18:01.200 --> 18:05.200]  Post poll that showed a 12-point national average, but that's the average of what they
[18:05.200 --> 18:06.200]  oversample.
[18:06.200 --> 18:07.640]  It happened to be 12.
[18:07.640 --> 18:10.680]  Like many of the recent polls, Reuters, ABC, and The Washington Post's latest poll included
[18:10.680 --> 18:13.480]  a nine-point sampling bias towards registered Democrats.
[18:13.480 --> 18:15.480]  They admit that.
[18:15.480 --> 18:17.520]  CNN's even worse in their phone system.
[18:17.520 --> 18:19.560]  They admit more than double Democrats they sample.
[18:19.560 --> 18:20.560]  I mean, that is cuckoo.
[18:20.560 --> 18:23.280]  By the way, we're about to go to break, but I want to play this clip first and then come
[18:23.280 --> 18:26.920]  back with Trump talking about this and then they demonizing.
[18:26.920 --> 18:29.120]  This is just last week.
[18:29.120 --> 18:30.120]  It's got no attention.
[18:30.120 --> 18:36.160]  In fact, there's two of these clips where you've got focus groups, 10 of them are for
[18:36.160 --> 18:41.200]  Trump, five are for Hillary, and then you've got six that are undecided and you can bet
[18:41.200 --> 18:45.480]  your bottom dollar they're just embarrassing really for Trump, but let's just say it's
[18:45.480 --> 18:46.760]  10 to five.
[18:46.760 --> 18:48.360]  That's double.
[18:48.360 --> 18:49.360]  That's double.
[18:49.360 --> 18:52.920]  I know Democrats all over Austin, they say they don't know anyone voting for Hillary.
[18:52.920 --> 18:54.680]  I saw one Hillary sticker this morning.
[18:54.680 --> 18:59.400]  I was looking all weekend in jam-packed traffic for Formula One here.
[18:59.400 --> 19:00.880]  It's like a game with my kids.
[19:00.880 --> 19:01.880]  Where's a Hillary sticker?
[19:01.880 --> 19:03.040]  I saw one.
[19:03.040 --> 19:06.280]  There are Bernie Sanders stickers everywhere.
[19:06.280 --> 19:09.160]  Their signs are still up everywhere.
[19:09.160 --> 19:11.960]  You can't go a half mile without seeing one.
[19:11.960 --> 19:16.440]  No Hillary unless you go to the most elite rich area, then there's some signs up.
[19:16.440 --> 19:17.440]  It is a hoax.
[19:17.440 --> 19:18.440]  We're going to go to break.
[19:18.440 --> 19:23.880]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to first play, seeing it in, and boy, they cut the
[19:23.880 --> 19:25.640]  fee just like they cut the satellite.
[19:25.640 --> 19:30.360]  As soon as they go and it's double the Trump supporters, they shut it down, and that's
[19:30.360 --> 19:31.360]  what's happening.
[19:31.360 --> 19:36.160]  We can't find Hillary supporters back during the primaries on the streets anywhere in the
[19:36.160 --> 19:37.160]  US.
[19:37.160 --> 19:40.840]  We cannot even find them.
[19:40.840 --> 19:43.760]  So something's going on here.
[19:43.760 --> 19:50.560]  And we know they are massively over-sampling Hillary supporters or Democrats, these imaginary
[19:50.560 --> 19:55.240]  people, to say that Trump is losing to create the perception so when they do steal it, there's
[19:55.240 --> 19:58.000]  plausible bi-ability, basically.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.000]  We'll be back.
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.000]  Stay with us.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.520]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[20:05.520 --> 20:07.280]  food and boil water.
[20:07.280 --> 20:11.400]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's
[20:11.400 --> 20:12.600]  a much better way.
[20:12.600 --> 20:17.440]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[20:17.440 --> 20:19.120]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[20:19.120 --> 20:23.160]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[20:23.160 --> 20:27.760]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,
[20:27.760 --> 20:29.560]  go to Minutemanstove.com.
[20:29.560 --> 20:31.360]  That's Minutemanstove.com.
[20:31.360 --> 20:36.360]  Charlie Daniels, he's always offended the Second Amendment.
[20:36.360 --> 20:38.880]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21, individual rights, protect the
[20:38.880 --> 20:42.560]  back seat, do the collecting, or you know what the next post is going to be, don't you?
[20:42.560 --> 20:43.560]  It's going to be coming after you, go ahead.
[20:43.560 --> 20:50.040]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, and beef was for supper.
[20:50.040 --> 20:55.400]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available,
[20:55.400 --> 21:01.400]  or shed some tears over the red, white, and blue, Revelation, the movie.info.
[21:01.400 --> 21:02.400]  Think about this.
[21:02.400 --> 21:06.480]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[21:06.480 --> 21:11.640]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines,
[21:11.640 --> 21:15.840]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants, and no, water treatment
[21:15.840 --> 21:19.480]  plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[21:19.480 --> 21:23.000]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted big Berkey water filter.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.720]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,
[21:28.720 --> 21:34.160]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria, and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.
[21:34.160 --> 21:38.400]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market, the gold standard
[21:38.400 --> 21:43.400]  in water purification, and our filters last for years at less than two cents per gallon.
[21:43.400 --> 21:47.240]  Big Berkey, the one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[22:01.200 --> 22:05.680]  Reality check, rampant hacking, identity theft, mass surveillance, defending yourself today
[22:05.680 --> 22:06.680]  is not an option.
[22:06.680 --> 22:07.680]  It's a requirement.

[23:56.080 --> 23:59.680]  Call now before it's too late, 800-328-1860.
[23:59.680 --> 24:14.040]  If we remove Donald Trump out of the equation and just look at the state of the corporate
[24:14.040 --> 24:21.560]  media in this country and their constituents, it is an exercise in criminality.
[24:21.560 --> 24:24.960]  It's an exercise in lockstep disinformation.
[24:24.960 --> 24:32.760]  It's an exercise in the takeover of this country.
[24:32.760 --> 24:38.520]  And the people going along with it are the folks that are going to end up basically losing
[24:38.520 --> 24:41.320]  their prosperity, losing their freedom in the process.
[24:41.320 --> 24:47.120]  So it is a fool's game, an absolute fool's errand.
[24:47.120 --> 24:49.320]  This whole corrupt system must be overturned.
[24:49.320 --> 24:54.200]  The problem is they're trying to overturn one corrupt system with even more dracotene
[24:54.200 --> 25:01.600]  control, because at the bottom of all this is an immorality, a corruption.
[25:01.600 --> 25:04.720]  This nation, this world has cancer.
[25:04.720 --> 25:08.020]  And so it's so incredible to have all these WikiLeaks emails and have a new one with
[25:08.020 --> 25:17.520]  Podesta, the head of the campaign for Hillary, telling Democrats how to rig the polls and
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.080]  directing that they were doing it through oversampling.
[25:20.080 --> 25:24.520]  So they go out and they do these polls, the Democrats pay for the polls, but in many cases
[25:24.520 --> 25:29.240]  the big media outlets are run by Democratic Party operatives and top donors, the top 20
[25:29.240 --> 25:35.160]  companies are on record, lockstep against Trump and the populist movement.
[25:35.160 --> 25:40.840]  And then they have them oversample massively to put Hillary way ahead in some polls, but
[25:40.840 --> 25:45.400]  they'll only oversample 9, 10, 11, 12 points to have her in a dead heat with him because
[25:45.400 --> 25:47.560]  that's really how far ahead Trump is.
[25:47.560 --> 25:55.880]  Again, 10 to 15 points is about as accurate as we can get.
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.920]  So here's CNN and the focus group, the people they brought in and basically instructed how
[26:00.920 --> 26:04.320]  to vote, even though they've been caught on tape instructing them to go for Hillary,
[26:04.320 --> 26:05.880]  it backfires every week.
[26:05.880 --> 26:07.360]  This happens every week here at us.
[26:07.360 --> 26:12.160]  Let's ask the group with a show of hands, did this debate help any of you decide on
[26:12.160 --> 26:13.160]  a candidate?
[26:13.160 --> 26:17.760]  And if so, how many of you have decided now to vote for Hillary Clinton?
[26:17.760 --> 26:20.560]  One, two, three, five of you.
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.560]  Okay, how about did this debate help you decide to vote for Donald Trump?
[26:24.560 --> 26:26.560]  Ten of you.
[26:26.560 --> 26:27.560]  All right.
[26:27.560 --> 26:31.560]  We've got a third party, Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, did it make you want to vote for any
[26:31.560 --> 26:32.560]  of them?
[26:32.560 --> 26:33.560]  Or indecided.
[26:33.560 --> 26:36.560]  Okay, well that's what I was going to ask you next, who is still undecided here?
[26:36.560 --> 26:37.560]  How many?
[26:37.560 --> 26:43.320]  One, two, three, four, five, six of them, still undecided.
[26:43.320 --> 26:50.760]  So that's five for Hillary, six undecided, they didn't want Gary Johnson or Jill Stein,
[26:50.760 --> 26:51.760]  and ten for Trump.
[26:51.760 --> 26:54.160]  But you're not going to see that anywhere.
[26:54.160 --> 26:58.360]  That's what though keeps coming out when they do focus groups that they don't fully control
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.680]  after they actually hear Donald Trump speak.
[27:00.680 --> 27:06.400]  Now, that's what we have, CNN executives saying we made a big mistake ever letting any of
[27:06.400 --> 27:09.800]  them get on CNN, stop carrying any of his speeches.
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.720]  First they carry big chunks because it got top ratings because he's popular, then they
[27:12.720 --> 27:13.720]  carry small chunks.
[27:13.720 --> 27:17.320]  Now, they just carry stuff out of context.
[27:17.320 --> 27:18.720]  Here's the next clip.
[27:18.720 --> 27:22.960]  This is, again, CNN saying they're already looking ahead.
[27:22.960 --> 27:27.480]  So they show a clip of Trump saying that he's gaining in polls or that he's even with
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.840]  or two points ahead, and that's him going off some of the more less unfair, they're still
[27:32.840 --> 27:38.840]  on fair polls, he's way ahead, then they cut to, oh, but we're already looking ahead past
[27:38.840 --> 27:40.720]  Trump and what Hillary's going to do.
[27:40.720 --> 27:42.280]  Here it is.
[27:42.280 --> 27:47.120]  That we are leading nationally by two points.
[27:47.120 --> 27:50.800]  Numbers are looking phenomenal in Florida, don't believe the media.
[27:50.800 --> 27:55.560]  But a new ABC News national poll shows Trump trailing Clinton by 12 points.
[27:55.560 --> 28:00.280]  Meantime, CNN has learned Clinton is increasingly moving beyond Trump and turning her attention
[28:00.280 --> 28:02.480]  to her transition to the presidency.
[28:02.480 --> 28:07.000]  A Democrat close to Clinton saying, she's not being arrogant, she's being diligent.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.320]  Clinton is sizing up, candidate.
[28:09.320 --> 28:16.800]  No, guys, I was just saying I wanted you while that was on screen to show people this article
[28:16.800 --> 28:20.800]  so we can finish the clip and I want to just show TV viewers, that's the other clip.
[28:20.800 --> 28:22.800]  I thought it was, center of my sheet was longer than that.
[28:22.800 --> 28:23.960]  Okay, well, let's play the clip again.
[28:23.960 --> 28:25.560]  I think it's very, very informative.
[28:25.560 --> 28:27.920]  Let's just play that clip again here, Desmond.
[28:27.920 --> 28:32.440]  That we are leading nationally by two points.
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.440]  Numbers are looking phenomenal in Florida, don't believe the media.
[28:36.440 --> 28:41.120]  But a new ABC News national poll shows Trump trailing Clinton by 12 points.
[28:41.120 --> 28:45.920]  Meantime, CNN has learned Clinton is increasingly moving beyond Trump and turning her attention
[28:45.920 --> 28:48.120]  to her transition to the presidency.
[28:48.120 --> 28:53.320]  A Democrat close to Clinton saying, she's not being arrogant, she's being diligent.
[28:53.320 --> 28:56.480]  Clinton is sizing up, candidate.
[28:56.480 --> 29:03.800]  Now, remember, the very poll they're just showing on screen has a, we just showed you
[29:03.800 --> 29:11.720]  earlier, here it is from Zero Hedge, a 12% oversampling of Democrats and what was Hillary
[29:11.720 --> 29:12.720]  ahead?
[29:12.720 --> 29:13.720]  12 points.
[29:13.720 --> 29:17.400]  I mean, right there, that's saying dead heat.
[29:17.400 --> 29:25.160]  The article is up on infowars.com, it's up on prisonplanet.com, it's up on drudgerport.com,
[29:25.160 --> 29:31.080]  along with the next clip we've got when we come back, and that's the professor who predicted
[29:31.080 --> 29:37.280]  last five elections says Trump has 87% chance of winning.
[29:37.280 --> 29:42.520]  And Google, it's own Googlebot, what a few months ago admitted that Trump is set to win.
[29:42.520 --> 29:47.400]  I mean, even in places like the District of Columbia, Hillary barely has a lead.
[29:47.400 --> 29:51.240]  She's supposed to win District of Columbia by 25 points, not any more.
[29:51.240 --> 29:55.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 30:02.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:02.640 --> 30:07.560]  In a private 2012 board meeting, George Soros said that the rise of money in politics poses
[30:07.560 --> 30:09.280]  a great threat to democracy.
[30:09.280 --> 30:14.120]  Ironically, his primary role in politics has been a benefactor to corrupt politicos.
[30:14.120 --> 30:18.680]  This is coming from a hacked internal document from Soros's Open Society Foundation.
[30:18.680 --> 30:20.840]  It was published by DCLeaks this summer.
[30:20.840 --> 30:25.560]  Now, including in the DCLeaks dump, were the meetings of this meeting from the OSF board.
[30:25.560 --> 30:30.000]  The meeting was attended by OSF staff, along with Soros, and during the meeting, they were
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.280]  tackling challenges like how best to create a, quote, racial narrative.
[30:34.280 --> 30:38.000]  According to the minute, Soros told attendees he believes the rise of money in politics
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.560]  endangers our democracy.
[30:39.560 --> 30:43.920]  Ironically, that didn't stop Soros from giving $10 million to a pro-Clinton super PAC, or
[30:43.920 --> 30:49.040]  stop him from secretly paying the salaries of four staffers of the Moldovan Prime Minister's
[30:49.040 --> 30:50.040]  office.
[30:50.040 --> 30:53.840]  As Hillary mentioned all the dark money and getting it out of politics in the last debate,
[30:53.840 --> 30:56.640]  she didn't mean people like her BFF, George Soros.
[30:56.640 --> 31:26.480]  I'm Margaret Hale reporting for Infowars.com.
[31:27.640 --> 31:30.160]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[31:57.640 --> 32:01.560]  That's InfowarsTeam.com.
[32:01.560 --> 32:06.520]  You know in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's
[32:06.520 --> 32:11.480]  talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential
[32:11.480 --> 32:18.560]  for power grid chaos, EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes,
[32:18.560 --> 32:21.920]  ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[32:21.920 --> 32:25.240]  My friend's chaos is already here, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[32:25.240 --> 32:29.840]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply
[32:29.840 --> 32:31.200]  of backup electricity.
[32:31.200 --> 32:36.280]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house, the solutions from science
[32:36.280 --> 32:37.280]  system.
[32:37.280 --> 32:39.880]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[32:39.880 --> 32:42.000]  Solutions from science only makes the best equipment.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.880]  Go to powergridchaos.com.
[32:44.880 --> 32:47.800]  That's powergridchaos.com to check it out.
[32:47.800 --> 32:54.560]  Now this is key, right now get 70% off, they're top of the line perfect power solar generator.

[33:26.920 --> 33:33.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.720]  There was an amateur video that popped up the last few days on YouTube that I thought
[33:38.720 --> 33:44.040]  was extremely powerful that we aired yesterday that is starting to go viral.
[33:44.040 --> 33:48.520]  And we've tweeted it at real Alex Jones with the headline, this video could win the election
[33:48.520 --> 33:49.520]  for Trump.
[33:49.520 --> 33:55.440]  It's extremely powerful as things that Trump has said that you never see on the news that
[33:55.440 --> 33:57.160]  they basically blockade.
[33:57.160 --> 34:02.040]  I'm going to air that report coming up here in about 10 minutes and we have Joel Scowles
[34:02.040 --> 34:05.000]  in in studio with us always informative.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.880]  But the video was up on infowars.com, please retweet the video.
[34:09.880 --> 34:16.920]  This video could win the election for Trump or find it on my Twitter at real Alex Jones
[34:16.920 --> 34:18.280]  and tweet it at Donald Trump.
[34:18.280 --> 34:21.440]  He needs to tweet this out.
[34:21.440 --> 34:25.600]  He can tweet whatever he wants to say about it like powerful compilation of my words
[34:25.600 --> 34:33.080]  or this is what the media doesn't want you to see Donald Trump because it's powerful.
[34:33.080 --> 34:36.560]  It deserves to get 30 million views.
[34:36.560 --> 34:37.560]  I'll be frank with you.
[34:37.560 --> 34:40.600]  We do some videos around here and they're all important.
[34:40.600 --> 34:44.000]  But when something gets 20 million views, which happens routinely or 10 million views
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.520]  or 30 million views and it's not our most hardcore information, I get upset because
[34:50.520 --> 34:55.160]  I'll spend a week on something and it gets a million views, which is not negligible.
[34:55.160 --> 34:57.160]  It's not chop liver.
[34:57.160 --> 35:00.840]  And man, if it got 20 million 30 million views, it could change the world.
[35:00.840 --> 35:02.160]  But here's the good news.
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.960]  We're putting so much hardcore info out that it's all having a huge effect.
[35:06.960 --> 35:08.280]  You are having a huge effect.
[35:08.280 --> 35:16.600]  The enemy is not going to tell you that Andrea Mitchell talk about a consulate insider.
[35:16.600 --> 35:23.280]  I think she's married to Ellen Greenspan talk about an insider is on the plane last week
[35:23.280 --> 35:29.720]  with Hillary and her press secretary is handing a phone with questions, Mitchell nods and
[35:29.720 --> 35:33.360]  then ask the question about Trump bullying women.
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.680]  I mean, they sit there and rig the questions in front of you.
[35:37.680 --> 35:40.920]  They oversample the polls to say Hillary's ahead.
[35:40.920 --> 35:47.040]  This is outrageous, outrageous.
[35:47.040 --> 35:53.120]  But the good news is if Trump didn't run, if we didn't build the Tea Party movement,
[35:53.120 --> 35:55.720]  if you didn't take action, we'd be in worse shape now.
[35:55.720 --> 35:59.480]  At least now they've got to debate the new world order global government.
[35:59.480 --> 36:03.160]  They've got to debate Obamacare being a giant screw job.
[36:03.160 --> 36:07.120]  They've got to face the record and time is on our side.
[36:07.120 --> 36:08.520]  Time is not on their side.
[36:08.520 --> 36:10.640]  That's why they're moving to censor the Internet.
[36:10.640 --> 36:15.040]  That's why they're moving towards authoritarianism and we're fighting them every step of the
[36:15.040 --> 36:16.040]  way.
[36:16.040 --> 36:17.520]  And more and more, they're losing ground.
[36:17.520 --> 36:20.920]  Yes, they're able to engage in Comptroller fraud.
[36:20.920 --> 36:24.320]  They're able to engage in executive fraud because they're at the top.
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.080]  They're able to wave wands and make Hillary above the law, but not above the court of
[36:28.080 --> 36:29.080]  public opinion.
[36:29.080 --> 36:36.000]  And now the new email from Podesta, her head of her campaign is out talking to media and
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.440]  talking to staff about how to quote oversample so Hillary looks like she's invincible.
[36:42.440 --> 36:45.800]  The story is on infowars.com.
[36:45.800 --> 36:46.960]  It's a zero hedge article.
[36:46.960 --> 36:49.160]  It's red linked on drivereport.com.
[36:49.160 --> 36:53.760]  I don't care where you get it, get it and send it out to people and we've done a whole
[36:53.760 --> 36:54.920]  bunch of videos on this.
[36:54.920 --> 37:01.360]  I mean, probably, I don't want to exaggerate 20 reports the last year about how Reuters
[37:01.360 --> 37:06.360]  rigs polls, just search Reuters caught rigging poll infowars.com.
[37:06.360 --> 37:10.280]  Let's search it right down for TV viewers and you'll see a bunch of videos showing them
[37:10.280 --> 37:11.280]  doing it.
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.680]  25 points, 15 points over sample Bloomberg caught doing it, ABC caught doing it.
[37:16.680 --> 37:21.800]  The ABC poll they quoted earlier oversampled Democrats 12%.
[37:21.800 --> 37:26.920]  What did Hillary win by 12% you're like, well, wait a minute, I thought you said he's really
[37:26.920 --> 37:27.920]  ahead of her.
[37:27.920 --> 37:32.840]  The Florida poll and where they hide the numbers is the independent sampling.
[37:32.840 --> 37:36.520]  But I just guessed they know they can't say independence 40%, you know, and then oversample
[37:36.520 --> 37:37.520]  out of that.
[37:37.520 --> 37:38.520]  They've got to say we oversampled Democrats.
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.020]  I don't know why they're being honest.
[37:40.020 --> 37:41.040]  You're going to lie in the poll.
[37:41.040 --> 37:43.280]  Why put it methodology?
[37:43.280 --> 37:46.480]  Because I think somehow by them telling us, they think it makes it okay.
[37:46.480 --> 37:47.480]  Like, we're not hiding.
[37:47.480 --> 37:48.480]  We did that.
[37:48.480 --> 37:49.480]  We're the pollsters.
[37:49.480 --> 37:50.480]  We're the scientists.
[37:50.480 --> 37:52.480]  So it doesn't matter.
[37:52.480 --> 37:54.680]  Hey, when you can meet.
[37:54.680 --> 38:00.280]  I also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start
[38:00.280 --> 38:03.480]  in February by market regions, et cetera.
[38:03.480 --> 38:08.480]  I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what
[38:08.480 --> 38:12.800]  we get out of our media polling, boom.
[38:12.800 --> 38:16.600]  This is Podesta in emails with his minions.
[38:16.600 --> 38:19.160]  I mean, I don't need wiki leaks.
[38:19.160 --> 38:20.760]  I can read it.
[38:20.760 --> 38:21.760]  It's a fraud.
[38:21.760 --> 38:23.560]  And then you talk to Trendy's on the street.
[38:23.560 --> 38:25.280]  They don't support Hillary.
[38:25.280 --> 38:28.880]  None of them have stickers on their cars, but they will go, oh, you're just mad.
[38:28.880 --> 38:30.400]  You like that racist Trump.
[38:30.400 --> 38:34.320]  And I'm like, listen, this is not about Trump anymore.
[38:34.320 --> 38:39.800]  This is about the integrity of this country and the fact that the evil is being flaunted
[38:39.800 --> 38:41.720]  in our face.
[38:41.720 --> 38:45.720]  All the big corporations, all the big evil countries like China and Saudi Arabia, every
[38:45.720 --> 38:52.480]  corrupt organization, Hollywood, the big banks, Goldman Sachs, the weapons manufacturers,
[38:52.480 --> 39:01.120]  the big drug companies are just flooding her with money, propping her up.
[39:01.120 --> 39:05.520]  The analogy be like the movie Tron, I saw that on TV last week and watched like 10
[39:05.520 --> 39:06.520]  minutes of it.
[39:06.520 --> 39:10.560]  And you've got, you know, the evil program that actually runs the whole show, but it's
[39:10.560 --> 39:18.160]  got a human that jacks into the matrix who's like his top minion or a avatar of the human
[39:18.160 --> 39:22.040]  that's in the real world that heads up the software company and he's actually fighting
[39:22.040 --> 39:27.040]  a human that's been put into the matrix like system.
[39:27.040 --> 39:31.920]  And the big central computer starts to lose because its program is all based on game programs
[39:31.920 --> 39:34.800]  and he says, all my systems are yours.
[39:34.800 --> 39:36.280]  I forget the bad guy character's name.
[39:36.280 --> 39:43.600]  He like grows up to 500 feet tall and that's basically what they've done to Hillary.
[39:43.600 --> 39:49.160]  They have just, just all our systems are yours, all the money, all the power, all the propaganda,
[39:49.160 --> 39:53.120]  every dirty trick, everything, everything is yours.
[39:53.120 --> 40:01.640]  And then they say in the financial times of London, in the economist, in the New York
[40:01.640 --> 40:06.240]  Times, in every globalist publication from the Atlantic monthly to you name it, we're
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.520]  in red alert, Hillary's in trouble.
[40:08.520 --> 40:09.960]  We've got to put everything behind her.
[40:09.960 --> 40:15.020]  If she falls, we fall because of the domino of Brexit and the domino of the Russians pulling
[40:15.020 --> 40:19.800]  out of the globalist system, red alert, every country in the Euro is trying to pull out.
[40:19.800 --> 40:23.160]  They've got General Milley, the head of the army threatening countries and they try to
[40:23.160 --> 40:27.120]  pull out of the Euro, well, hits you harder than you've ever been hit before.
[40:27.120 --> 40:32.560]  That's because this whole stinking system is in trouble and it wasn't supposed to go
[40:32.560 --> 40:33.560]  down this early.
[40:33.560 --> 40:36.760]  It was supposed to collapse after some big world war and then they bring in the super
[40:36.760 --> 40:37.760]  world government.
[40:37.760 --> 40:40.360]  But the whole thing is falling apart.
[40:40.360 --> 40:48.080]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray, a tale of two cities, two cities.
[40:48.080 --> 40:52.320]  That's best of times, worst of times.
[40:52.320 --> 41:03.800]  So this election is lovely and dark and deep, but I've got light years to go before I sleep.
[41:03.800 --> 41:08.360]  Whatever happens in 14 days, you better believe this whole process has been rigged, the media
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.680]  has been rigged, the polls have been rigged and if it convinces the public that Trump's
[41:12.680 --> 41:17.440]  really a loser and people stay home and then he loses, it was rigged.
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.240]  But it was mind control, so technically it wasn't.
[41:21.240 --> 41:25.240]  We forfeited because we were weak-minded.
[41:25.240 --> 41:28.760]  But I don't think that's going to happen, folks.
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.720]  That's why they've got the Democrats out voting 10 times and that's why they're getting caught
[41:31.720 --> 41:36.040]  and don't care and you see the criminal arrogance, it is an incredible time to be alive.
[41:36.040 --> 41:40.680]  I want to play some more of these clips, but first off, we are running a special on our
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.600]  flagship Neutropic product that just takes natural compounds that are known to healthily
[41:45.600 --> 41:48.240]  boost brain activity.
[41:48.240 --> 41:49.240]  It's so strong, quite frankly.
[41:49.240 --> 41:50.680]  I don't even ever really need it.
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.040]  I probably should take one a day because I exercised so hard today.
[41:54.040 --> 41:56.560]  I'm pretty exhausted, but I haven't taken one yet.
[41:56.560 --> 41:58.040]  That'll be about four o'clock today.
[41:58.040 --> 41:59.040]  I'll have to keep going.
[41:59.040 --> 42:01.760]  But it's got a bunch of amazing Neutropics in it.
[42:01.760 --> 42:06.280]  It supports the broadcast, leading competitors are $50, $60 for things that are similar and
[42:06.280 --> 42:07.920]  aren't even as organic.
[42:07.920 --> 42:11.280]  It's $22 right now with 25% off.
[42:11.280 --> 42:14.280]  Mega special on BrainForce.
[42:14.280 --> 42:17.160]  Read the hundreds of five-star reviews, BrainForce.
[42:17.160 --> 42:19.760]  Secure your BrainForce and support the InfoWare.
[42:19.760 --> 42:25.720]  InfoWareStore.com or InfoWareLive.com takes you right to the subsection where you'll find
[42:25.720 --> 42:26.720]  our supplements.
[42:26.720 --> 42:31.200]  Kathy and Pittsburgh PA said, five stars, I'll be refilling.
[42:31.200 --> 42:33.520]  I was amazed at how well this product made me feel.
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.440]  I did not expect to be 100% what it was taken up to be, but definitely is.
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.560]  I have cut out my five-hour energy daily with this supplement.
[42:43.560 --> 42:44.560]  Thanks.
[42:44.560 --> 42:45.560]  Oh, yeah.
[42:45.560 --> 42:46.560]  Oh, yeah.
[42:46.560 --> 42:51.720]  I haven't even had coffee today, folks, because I've gotten so leaned off of things just taking
[42:51.720 --> 42:52.720]  BrainForce.
[42:52.720 --> 42:53.920]  Now I've gotten to the point where I need BrainForce.
[42:53.920 --> 42:54.920]  I take Selenium.
[42:54.920 --> 43:00.080]  I'll just be honest, our bio-true Selenium gives me even better cleaner energy than this.
[43:00.080 --> 43:01.720]  But it varies people to people.
[43:01.720 --> 43:04.040]  Some folks take the Selenium instead of, you know, they don't really feel it.
[43:04.040 --> 43:07.640]  Maybe you weren't deficient in it, but bio-true Selenium is the strongest, most powerful
[43:07.640 --> 43:10.840]  organic stuff you're going to find anywhere at a price that is a joke.
[43:10.840 --> 43:12.040]  It's so inexpensive.
[43:12.040 --> 43:14.360]  From the mustard seed.
[43:14.360 --> 43:17.440]  So bio-true Selenium, in fact, let me know in the reviews which one you like better.
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.560]  I need to take my bio-true, I haven't taken any since Friday.
[43:21.560 --> 43:22.560]  That's one reason I'm probably low.
[43:22.560 --> 43:23.560]  I'm not even low on energy.
[43:23.560 --> 43:26.000]  I'm just so relaxed today.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.400]  I was like driving and almost falling asleep.
[43:27.400 --> 43:29.960]  I don't know what's going on, but I feel good now that I'm on air.
[43:29.960 --> 43:34.560]  I don't ever want to be without this product, said Davish in Vancouver, Washington.
[43:34.560 --> 43:37.240]  I see a major difference in my mental clarity when I take this product.
[43:37.240 --> 43:40.840]  I don't ever want to be without it.
[43:40.840 --> 43:45.960]  So that's just two of the hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews at infowarslife.com or
[43:45.960 --> 43:49.040]  call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[43:49.040 --> 43:51.480]  And Living Defense is also back in stock.
[43:51.480 --> 43:52.880]  It's sold out for months at a time.
[43:52.880 --> 43:55.960]  One of our best sellers, even though it's sold out most of the time, because it's got
[43:55.960 --> 43:57.960]  so many ingredients, it's hard to get them all.
[43:57.960 --> 44:02.320]  Now, they'll all be organic-level California standards that's made to be impossible so
[44:02.320 --> 44:03.320]  the lawyers can sue everybody.
[44:03.320 --> 44:06.600]  But we do pass the California standards.
[44:06.600 --> 44:09.480]  Every once in a while, you just cannot get an ingredient that's California standard.
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.120]  And we'll put on the website then, this batch does not pass California standards, say, with
[44:14.120 --> 44:15.120]  this ingredient.
[44:15.120 --> 44:16.120]  Sorry.
[44:16.120 --> 44:18.680]  So now you can't have it in California, but that happens rarely.
[44:18.680 --> 44:20.880]  But that's why we sell out of stuff so often.
[44:20.880 --> 44:25.000]  That's not some artificial scarcity gimmick, believe me.
[44:25.000 --> 44:26.920]  We're sold out of this more than we have in stock.
[44:26.920 --> 44:29.520]  Because it's got so much stuff in it, it's so hard to keep clean.
[44:29.520 --> 44:30.520]  But it is clean.
[44:30.520 --> 44:31.520]  It's excellent.

[44:55.000 --> 45:04.080]  Okay, wow, where to start here?
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.760]  I want to get to the professor and more on election fraud, because this is such a big
[45:08.760 --> 45:09.760]  deal.
[45:09.760 --> 45:15.640]  I'm going to be honest with you, I am grieving for this country.
[45:15.640 --> 45:19.400]  I am grieving for this country.
[45:19.400 --> 45:24.560]  I mean, it freaks me out that Democrats don't support Hillary.
[45:24.560 --> 45:27.800]  They don't put the stickers on their cars, but I'm sure 30% of the public probably will
[45:27.800 --> 45:28.800]  vote for her.
[45:28.800 --> 45:31.240]  I mean, I'm sure there's some real numbers there.
[45:31.240 --> 45:33.440]  That's what the polls show.
[45:33.440 --> 45:38.160]  And it's this power trip, like you're part of the power structure, and you're beating
[45:38.160 --> 45:43.400]  your fellow Americans by putting Hillary in, and you don't care if there's fraud, and
[45:43.400 --> 45:46.640]  you buy into all this crap that he's a racist and everything, that isn't true, and you
[45:46.640 --> 45:47.840]  know it's not.
[45:47.840 --> 45:51.040]  You just think going along with the herd makes you wonderful.
[45:51.040 --> 45:56.920]  No, going along with the herd turns the country into North Korea.
[45:56.920 --> 46:00.160]  So the first thing I want to play before I get to all this is the video that's up on
[46:00.160 --> 46:02.880]  infowars.com that I'm going to have red linked.
[46:02.880 --> 46:09.920]  We also tweeted it at Real Alex Jones, and this is not our video.
[46:09.920 --> 46:12.160]  This is not posted to my site.
[46:12.160 --> 46:14.760]  We've put up our version of it with my commentary.
[46:14.760 --> 46:20.760]  I can care less about the views, except that I want to absolutely devastate the globalist.
[46:20.760 --> 46:26.560]  And this video will cut through to even brain debt, and I think it's one of the best videos
[46:26.560 --> 46:30.640]  out there because it's just what Donald Trump's been saying that we don't ever hear.
[46:30.640 --> 46:32.960]  I don't have time to sit down and watch most of his speeches.
[46:32.960 --> 46:42.240]  I watch a few weeks with my kids at night, and it is so incredibly important.
[46:42.240 --> 46:45.400]  There's another video up there that proves Donald Trump is right about election fraud
[46:45.400 --> 46:50.600]  that shows the Democrats all admitting it, but the particular one I'm talking about has
[46:50.600 --> 46:55.640]  the title, This Video Will Get Donald Trump Elected.
[46:55.640 --> 46:57.840]  And it is so important.
[46:57.840 --> 46:59.880]  It's the second video down.
[46:59.880 --> 47:02.080]  This video could win the election for Trump.
[47:02.080 --> 47:04.920]  Please get it out to everyone you know.
[47:04.920 --> 47:07.560]  And again, that's the info wars version we've got posted.
[47:07.560 --> 47:10.880]  We're also linked to the grassroots fellow to put this together who I'd love to hire
[47:10.880 --> 47:12.640]  as an editor at work for us here.
[47:12.640 --> 47:15.760]  We're looking for folks that have the amazing talent that we have here with our current
[47:15.760 --> 47:16.760]  crew.
[47:16.760 --> 47:20.840]  We've got people that have the talent yet to find some new people, but we're looking
[47:20.840 --> 47:23.360]  to augment our operation right now with a few more editors.
[47:23.360 --> 47:27.320]  So send your resumes in, folks, with a video, and I'm going to try to hire whoever this
[47:27.320 --> 47:33.000]  is because they're excellent because, again, I hear him talk about such amazing things
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.880]  when I actually watch his speeches, and then I realize nobody's seeing those because the
[47:36.880 --> 47:38.440]  news won't show them.
[47:38.440 --> 47:42.520]  We have to air this here on Talk Radio because even though 90% of our audience every day
[47:42.520 --> 47:46.720]  are regulars, the 10% that tune in and out are millions every day.
[47:46.720 --> 47:52.160]  I mean, millions of people every day see our videos and our information that have never
[47:52.160 --> 47:58.080]  seen it before and go, whoa, I didn't know Trump was talking like that.
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.400]  But globalists admit in the WikiLeaks they want to make us poor.
[48:02.400 --> 48:07.680]  They have set up simple things like hire corporate taxes and letting China have lower currency
[48:07.680 --> 48:10.400]  that aren't fair so we cannot compete.
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.360]  To level that, it will absolutely turn the tables.
[48:15.360 --> 48:21.240]  If he cuts taxes and then just keeps spending the same, they'll pay down the debt $5 trillion.
[48:21.240 --> 48:25.360]  I mean, this is simple, people go, what do you mean, you cut taxes, more money comes
[48:25.360 --> 48:26.360]  in?
[48:26.360 --> 48:29.000]  That's what happens, folks, at least for three to four years.
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.120]  It doesn't happen forever.
[48:30.120 --> 48:34.720]  That's why you can't do it, maybe once a decade for maybe four or five years, but the point
[48:34.720 --> 48:41.800]  is, is that we haven't had a real tax cut in a long time and we need one.
[48:41.800 --> 48:44.600]  And it's what made America great.
[48:44.600 --> 48:48.560]  And so Trump isn't perfect, but they know he's not out to get us, they know he's a
[48:48.560 --> 48:49.560]  real guy.
[48:49.560 --> 48:52.160]  He never claimed to be the second coming of Christ.
[48:52.160 --> 48:58.720]  He never claimed to not be, you know, somewhat of a pig and all of us have been pigs in
[48:58.720 --> 49:00.840]  our lives, but compared to Hillary Clinton, he's an angel.
[49:00.840 --> 49:02.520]  This is a monstrous creature.
[49:02.520 --> 49:06.360]  In the new WikiLeaks, more came out on gun control that they really intend to try to
[49:06.360 --> 49:07.360]  have the abolition.
[49:07.360 --> 49:10.920]  They're going to try to use executive order, harassment and taxation to basically take
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.080]  the guns and they're going to have the Supreme Court, they're going to get four to five new
[49:14.080 --> 49:15.080]  people.
[49:15.080 --> 49:19.920]  This is the critical election and I'm never a lesser to evil guys.
[49:19.920 --> 49:24.480]  Trump is corrupt just like everybody, you know, King David did stuff a lot worse, but
[49:24.480 --> 49:27.520]  I think Trump's heart is right, but I'm not going to sit here and tell you I'm over lesser
[49:27.520 --> 49:29.080]  to evils.
[49:29.080 --> 49:33.800]  Trump isn't in the same universe or order of magnitude of evil that Hillary is, okay?
[49:33.800 --> 49:36.760]  Bottom line, he doesn't have the fruits of that.
[49:36.760 --> 49:41.160]  Hillary is turned over to evil.
[49:41.160 --> 49:44.920]  There's the latest WikiLeaks, Hillary Clinton had gun control supporters planted in town
[49:44.920 --> 49:45.920]  hall audience.
[49:45.920 --> 49:47.880]  Of course she did.
[49:47.880 --> 49:52.080]  Folks, we break, we cover it, and then our listeners start pointing out almost every
[49:52.080 --> 49:53.640]  one of their town halls.
[49:53.640 --> 49:56.400]  We kept wondering why the town halls were only like 70 people, I mean, she can get
[49:56.400 --> 49:57.400]  more than 70.
[49:57.400 --> 50:01.160]  They can bus in some, you know, elementary school students, she can get 500, you know,
[50:01.160 --> 50:02.160]  usually her things have 500,000.
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.200]  I kept wondering why suddenly a few months ago, everything was like a couple hundred,
[50:06.200 --> 50:10.040]  maybe 50, 60, 70, and we started looking, they were all actors and actresses.
[50:10.040 --> 50:13.520]  I'm talking about the kids and stuff that asks questions, the others were like extras.
[50:13.520 --> 50:14.520]  This is total scripting.
[50:14.520 --> 50:20.400]  I'm going to skip this break and I'm going to play this incredibly important video that
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.640]  again, we have millions of listeners right now, if you'll go to infowars.com and get
[50:24.640 --> 50:25.640]  this video.
[50:25.640 --> 50:33.720]  If you'll tweet it at Trump and others and get it out.
[50:33.720 --> 50:37.160]  I mean, I don't know how we brand it for folks to share it.
[50:37.160 --> 50:38.360]  I mean, it's all true.
[50:38.360 --> 50:41.280]  This video could win the election for Trump.
[50:41.280 --> 50:42.280]  That's what I said.
[50:42.280 --> 50:44.800]  That's what I named it.
[50:44.800 --> 50:45.800]  I don't know.
[50:45.800 --> 50:52.280]  What about this is the video the media doesn't want you to see or the Trump video the media
[50:52.280 --> 50:53.280]  doesn't want you to see?
[50:53.280 --> 50:54.280]  And that's true.
[50:54.280 --> 50:58.480]  In all their emails and their public statements, they say no more Trump speeches and it came
[50:58.480 --> 50:59.480]  out in WikiLeaks.
[50:59.480 --> 51:02.120]  That was four or five, six months ago.
[51:02.120 --> 51:05.400]  That's when suddenly they went from showing large portions of his speeches, which was
[51:05.400 --> 51:09.120]  making them, in some cases, CNN and people who never have any audiences.
[51:09.120 --> 51:11.920]  Imagine the show's got 200,000 people watching on average.
[51:11.920 --> 51:14.960]  They put a Trump speech on by the end of an hour long event.
[51:14.960 --> 51:17.440]  They've got six, seven, eight million people watching.
[51:17.440 --> 51:18.440]  They're making money finally.
[51:18.440 --> 51:19.440]  They're not bankrupt.
[51:19.440 --> 51:26.200]  They're giving folks what they want, then they started baiting and switching.
[51:26.200 --> 51:29.440]  They would just show an empty podium because that would get raised, but then cut it as
[51:29.440 --> 51:33.000]  soon as Trump got to the podium and then bait and switch and have their anti-Trump people
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.320]  there try to convince Trump viewers that tuned in, you know, don't go for Trump.
[51:36.320 --> 51:37.760]  And then that didn't work.
[51:37.760 --> 51:41.080]  So now they just show very short little 10 second clips.
[51:41.080 --> 51:42.080]  This is what they're doing.
[51:42.080 --> 51:43.080]  So what do we do?
[51:43.080 --> 51:45.920]  We get Trump speeches out to everyone.
[51:45.920 --> 51:47.920]  We get compilation speeches of Trump.
[51:47.920 --> 51:51.560]  I mean, I've been racking my brain how to get around these people and I figured it out.
[51:51.560 --> 51:57.200]  We've got to take his speech on the economy, his speech on security, his speech on the
[51:57.200 --> 51:58.560]  election being rigged.
[51:58.560 --> 52:02.360]  We've got to edit them down to five, 10 minute blurbs and send them out and say, this is
[52:02.360 --> 52:03.360]  what they don't want you to see.
[52:03.360 --> 52:08.760]  You've got to get people that are on the fence or aren't political to absolutely understand
[52:08.760 --> 52:11.240]  what's happening because this is historic.
[52:11.240 --> 52:14.000]  And again, they're going to probably steal it from them, folks.
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.440]  They're all in.
[52:16.440 --> 52:17.960]  They're all in.
[52:17.960 --> 52:23.560]  We have to affect the political, social, cultural battle space so that people understand what
[52:23.560 --> 52:29.880]  happened and so people understand this is all part of a process of our victory.
[52:29.880 --> 52:32.720]  But the awakenings here, people now know there's a shadow government.
[52:32.720 --> 52:34.360]  They know the media is completely rigged.
[52:34.360 --> 52:35.480]  It isn't liberal bias.
[52:35.480 --> 52:40.840]  It is criminal, organized, racketeering to defraud the public of their election and to
[52:40.840 --> 52:45.400]  deceive the people and to screw us with Obamacare and carbon taxes and the rest of it.
[52:45.400 --> 52:46.640]  This is a takeover.
[52:46.640 --> 52:48.760]  This is 21st century war.
[52:48.760 --> 52:55.080]  So here's the video that I believe if you get it out, we'll absolutely cause a landslide
[52:55.080 --> 52:56.200]  they can't steal.
[52:56.200 --> 52:57.840]  Here it is.
[52:57.840 --> 53:05.080]  Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new
[53:05.080 --> 53:08.880]  government controlled by you, the American people.
[53:08.880 --> 53:15.080]  The Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that funded exist for
[53:15.080 --> 53:20.000]  only one reason, to protect and enrich itself.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.200]  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.
[53:24.200 --> 53:29.320]  For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interest,
[53:29.320 --> 53:35.040]  they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind.
[53:35.040 --> 53:42.880]  Our campaign represents a true existential threat, like they haven't seen before.
[53:42.880 --> 53:45.640]  This is not simply another four year election.
[53:45.640 --> 53:52.560]  This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or
[53:52.560 --> 53:57.920]  not we the people reclaim control over our government.
[53:57.920 --> 54:04.800]  The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for
[54:04.800 --> 54:12.960]  our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies
[54:12.960 --> 54:17.320]  that have bled our country dry.
[54:17.320 --> 54:23.440]  The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.480]  as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries all around the world.
[54:28.480 --> 54:34.440]  It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed
[54:34.440 --> 54:39.800]  our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets
[54:39.800 --> 54:45.880]  of a handful of large corporations and political entities.
[54:45.880 --> 54:53.160]  This is a struggle for the survival of our nation and this will be our last chance to
[54:53.160 --> 54:54.160]  save it.
[54:54.160 --> 54:58.320]  This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the
[54:58.320 --> 55:05.040]  illusion of democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests
[55:05.040 --> 55:08.240]  rigging the system and our system is rigged.
[55:08.240 --> 55:10.560]  This is reality.
[55:10.560 --> 55:16.960]  You know it, they know it, I know it and pretty much the whole world knows it.
[55:16.960 --> 55:21.560]  The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure.
[55:21.560 --> 55:26.680]  We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in
[55:26.680 --> 55:33.720]  secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to
[55:33.720 --> 55:40.800]  enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.080]  Honestly, she should be locked up.
[55:45.080 --> 55:51.040]  The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press.
[55:51.040 --> 55:52.920]  Let's be clear on one thing.
[55:52.920 --> 55:57.440]  The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.
[55:57.440 --> 56:04.400]  They're a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity
[56:04.400 --> 56:12.240]  with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves.
[56:12.240 --> 56:18.280]  Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe.
[56:18.280 --> 56:26.160]  They will lie, lie, lie and then again they will do worse than that.
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.360]  They will do whatever is necessary.
[56:29.360 --> 56:32.080]  The Clintons are criminals, remember that.
[56:32.080 --> 56:38.760]  This is well documented and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive
[56:38.760 --> 56:46.640]  cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation
[56:46.640 --> 56:50.200]  in order to keep the Clintons in power.
[56:50.200 --> 56:55.880]  They knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones.
[56:55.880 --> 57:00.400]  They knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop them.
[57:00.400 --> 57:06.320]  Nevertheless, I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you.
[57:06.320 --> 57:11.440]  I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back.
[57:11.440 --> 57:12.960]  I knew this day would arrive.
[57:12.960 --> 57:19.600]  It's only a question of when and I knew the American people would rise above it and vote
[57:19.600 --> 57:22.400]  for the future they deserve.
[57:22.400 --> 57:26.920]  The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.
[57:26.920 --> 57:31.240]  The only force strong enough to save our country is us.
[57:31.240 --> 57:36.400]  The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American
[57:36.400 --> 57:37.400]  people.
[57:37.400 --> 57:43.160]  This great civilization has come upon a moment of reckoning.
[57:43.160 --> 57:45.240]  I didn't need to do this, though, believe me.
[57:45.240 --> 57:48.600]  I built a great company and I had a wonderful life.
[57:48.600 --> 57:53.840]  I could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and
[57:53.840 --> 57:58.480]  businesses for myself and my family instead of going through this absolute horror show
[57:58.480 --> 58:02.240]  of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks.
[58:02.240 --> 58:04.520]  Who would have thought?
[58:04.520 --> 58:12.720]  I'm doing it because this country has given me so much and I feel so strongly that it's
[58:12.720 --> 58:18.360]  my turn to give back to the country that I love.
[58:18.360 --> 58:26.520]  I'm doing this for the people and for the movement and we will take back this country
[58:26.520 --> 58:33.160]  for you and we will make America great again.

[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.280]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.760]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.920]  Yeah, if Trump gets stolen, Trump gets robbed.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920]  The poets will tell.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.920]  The poets tell how punch you'll fill.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.920]  Yeah, we're going to win big time, folks.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.600]  We can't lose.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.480]  Resistance is victory.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.920]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.920]  Punch you'll need your prayers is true.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920]  Save a few.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920]  Save a few.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.920]  We're left it to.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.920]  He only did.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.480]  He only did what he had to do.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480]  And now he's grown old.
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480]  And now he's grown old.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480]  A lot of time to be alive.
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:56.880]  You know, I don't want to sit here and talk about myself on the broadcast, but we're so
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880]  central.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880]  You're so central.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.040]  You are the Infowar to this, that there was another New York Times and a couple more Washington
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.720]  Post, an Austin American statesman.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.440]  I mean, so many, I can't even keep track of them, but because they'd asked me to be in
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:14.360]  the New York Times and the statesman and I'd said, no, I read these articles this weekend.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.080]  And the one in the local paper was like, I was told it was on Friday.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.920]  It was like in the front of the front section of the paper, a big spread.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.920]  I was titled the voice inside Donald Trump's head.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.640]  I don't have it in front of me because I just remembered this.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.880]  I want to talk about this weekend.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880]  There it is.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.640]  Austin's Alex Jones, the voice of Donald Trump's head, and it goes on to say, Jones
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.600]  is so dangerous because he doesn't just worry about the liberal media.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.840]  He believes they're part of a global program to deceive the American people and bring us
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  into slavery.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.760]  Well, I mean, it's in all the emails.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.800]  It says keep us dumb, make us poor, world government, carbon taxes.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.440]  Don't you understand?
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.480]  It's all public, not my interpretation.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.600]  You know we learned about all this because of the John Birch Society in the 50s and 60s.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.120]  They had a bunch of people inside the government who were being told get ready for this takeover.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.000]  They were putting it in the newspapers in the 60s, how they were going to bring in UN
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  troops.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  That's where that rumor always comes from.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.720]  Somewhere I've got like the Washington Post and LA Times with the images of how our troops
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.720]  get smaller.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.720]  Well, it's in memorandum 7277.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.520]  It's in the State Department of Public Law 7277.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.720]  It shows our helmets getting little and the UN helmets getting big.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.720]  Our tanks getting little.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720]  Their chips getting big.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.920]  And then it says we're going to end up turning our guns in.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:34.720]  They tried all this before.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.680]  They've been trying it all the time.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:45.960]  So what's frustrating is 95% of what we talk about or more is on the record.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.960]  And let me tell you, it's really tough battling something that's public and having an ignorant
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:52.120]  public laugh at you because the media makes jokes about it.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:57.200]  Kind of like Obamacare being a big screw job or death panels or raising prices.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.640]  And then Gruber goes on TV and says thank God you're stupid.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.520]  And now Obama's out giving speeches saying they're lying about Obamacare not being free.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:12.280]  I mean, wow, but you know, it really is a test.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.280]  Are you that stupid?
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:18.400]  I don't mean our audience, but new listeners, because it's in the new WikiLeaks, dump 16,
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.120]  the Podesta emails I covered almost exclusively last hour of the email.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.640]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com, middle column.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640]  It's on em4s.com.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.640]  It's where it came from.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.640]  I mean, we've got an article.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.960]  We've got it posted.
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.120]  WikiLeaks releases fresh batch of emails from Clinton campaign chair.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.920]  And then we've got our article where Podesta talks about how to rig the election with
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.320]  the Democrats and how to get all their major pollsters to oversample for Hillary.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.040]  And that's how they're doing it.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.800]  And they're doing it the naked way because they don't care.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.720]  So people ask, why don't you talk to the New York Times?
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.200]  Why don't you talk to the Austin American station?
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.880]  Why don't you talk to Vanity Fair or Esquire anymore?
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.800]  I don't, they don't even call hardly anymore because they know I don't talk to them because
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.400]  they just want me as a prop to act like they're real journalists and that they really talk
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.400]  to me.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.080]  They'll just take something I said out of context.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:17.640]  Just listen, if you want to choose foreign banks and you really want to choose the globalist
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.920]  and you want to do all this, fine, but stop acting like we're making stuff up.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.200]  They are coming for our guns.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.720]  They admit that.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.320]  They do believe our families are bad.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.720]  They do not believe we have religious freedom.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.680]  They're funding radical Islam to take over the Middle East and destabilize things.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:40.000]  I'm not part of this, okay, so denying these global movements are happening only makes
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.720]  you look like fools, especially now that it's all about to come down.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.840]  So Joel Scouse is coming in.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.120]  We've got so much to cover today, but I'll tell you, it is just an insane time to be
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.120]  alive.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.120]  They're trying to stir up major wars.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.600]  I've been telling you that for years now, the top British general says we're basically
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.360]  at war with Russia right now.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.360]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.080]  Stay with us.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.200]  National science professor Helmut Norpeth has accurately predicted the results of the
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.320]  last five presidential outcomes and he says Trump has this in the bag, asserting that Donald
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:17.040]  Trump has an 87% chance of defeating Clinton despite Clinton being ahead in the polls.
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.640]  Now, this information is in direct contradiction to nearly every mainstream media poll that
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.320]  suggests Clinton is leading in double digits.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.960]  Norpeth's model has correctly predicted the outcome of the popular vote for every election
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:34.680]  since 1996, including the 2000 race where Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush took
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.840]  the presidency.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.040]  He says this of his model usually turns out that the candidate who does better in his
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:43.440]  party's primary beats the other guy who does less well.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.720]  Many Trump supporters are now claiming the media spend that the election result is a
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:52.240]  foregone conclusion is a trick designed to convince potential voters to stay home on
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.880]  the A. If Norpeth is correct, we will be looking at President Donald J. Trump come January.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.880]  I'm Margaret Howell reporting for Infowars.com.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.520]  There was a mighty nation rest above all of creation.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.520]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.120]  Let me just read a little thing here from a gender point one, the American system of
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.880]  justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.880]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat, do the collective.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.880]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you?
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.880]  It's going to be coming after your guns.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.680]  It ain't going to sit well down my way at all.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.680]  It ain't going to sit well.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.880]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.880]  We need a thousand paul reveres.
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.880]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.880]  And beef was for supper.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:49.880]  Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:55.880]  Lauren Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, special ops general, Jerry Boykin, want to shed some
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.880]  tears over the red, white and blue?
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.880]  Revelation, the movie.info.

[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.880]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.880]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:34.880]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the

[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.880]  this is a sure win.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880]  10% off on auto ship.

[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:32.880]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.880]  Now, I've been really busy obviously and so have the listeners getting ready for this
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880]  election.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.880]  We're 14 days out and I've been wanting to get Joe Scowze into town for the last month
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:46.880]  that he's been busy with World Affairs Brief and also advising folks on high security homes
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.880]  across the United States.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.880]  So he's here with us on two subjects and will be with us some of the next hour and I believe
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.880]  we have Project Veritas giving us an exclusive, if not today, later this evening on the
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.880]  nightly news, but they're still finishing it up right now if they've had some security issues
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880]  as well.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.880]  But never have things been more naked and out in the open that we have a big corporate
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:10.880]  combine running the country.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.880]  We have special interest running the media, giving them exact talking points.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.880]  We have them being caught on TV doing it.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.880]  We also have the emails where they're running it.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.880]  We have new WikiLeaks, data dump 16 on Podesta, Hillary Sheevil staff.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:32.880]  Back in February, coordinating with the media to oversample the polls they pay for, to oversample
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.880]  nine to 45 points, sometimes higher.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.880]  I mean, I've seen some samples that are insane where, you know, they do 25% conservatives,
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.880]  45% Democrats, and the other is independents, mainly Democrats.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:50.880]  So Hillary is just incredibly unpopular, can't get crowds to come out.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.880]  It's amazing.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.880]  And we've got on screen one of those.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.880]  But one I really want to show for TV viewers is the one that's linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.880]  New Podesta email exposes playbook for rigging polls through oversamples.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:09.880]  And he's telling their media buyer in the email, I want to get this ready now.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880]  This is how you're going to do it.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880]  We're going to oversample.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.880]  And the oversampling really began right after the RNC when suddenly he was 15 points ahead
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.880]  across the board.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.880]  And that was even with other rigged polls.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.880]  They were only, you know, doing other little spin jobs.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.880]  They had to really hammer it.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.880]  So there's a chain of emails breaking that down.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.880]  It's up on infowars.com.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:34.880]  So those of you buying into this, you're the ultimate chumps who believe that she's really going to win.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.880]  They're only creating the illusion that a Hillary win is actually reality-based.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.880]  That's why the New York Times seeing in all of the headlines that Hillary's going to win by a landslide.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]  Trump's already lost.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880]  He might throw the towel in.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.880]  We keep hearing every week.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880]  Because Hillary's going to win in such a landslide.
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880]  Don't go to the polls.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.880]  There is no election fraud, but we've got to federalize it.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.880]  Now, Joe Scows is here for the next hour and a half or so.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.880]  I was asking him, what do you want to hit first?
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.880]  The situation in Turkey that you're an expert on?
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.880]  The situation in Syria?
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.880]  What's happened with all these Russian buildups in the Mediterranean?
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880]  What do you want to hit first?
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.880]  He said, well, let's hit the consolidation of media.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.880]  And what the whole alt-right speech of Hillary or I and others like Stephen Bannon of Breitbart were named.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:27.880]  And then he pointed out that the business insider says the GOP must do something about the conservative media industrial complex it wants to survive.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.880]  Now notice, they've said this on MSNBC.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.880]  They've said this in the New York Times.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880]  They've said it in the Washington Post.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:38.880]  They said it in the Austin American statesman this weekend that I'm the evil creature that's in the ear.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.880]  In fact, they even wrote a local article as well that said I'm a devil, that I'm satanic.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:49.880]  That was in the Chronicles this weekend and that I am influencing them like a literal devil.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:57.880]  So this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with here because by the end of the piece he says it's Alex Jones that's the devil.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.880]  So I don't want to talk about myself except this is what they're saying.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.880]  Now the truth is it's not Alex Jones.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880]  It's not my talking points.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.880]  It's not the John Burt's society's talking points.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:13.880]  It's not Joel Scalzen or his famous Uncle Cleon Scalzen, you know, the granddaddy of the modern resistance or Barry Goldwater.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.880]  We're facing a real thing.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.880]  So we see the same thing.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.880]  We have its emails.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.880]  We have its documents.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:21.880]  We had moles 60 years ago.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:27.880]  We've been trying to hold it back, but they want to make it that it's from Alex Jones because I'm flamboyant or whatever.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.880]  They want to cut it out like it's a made up cosmology that came from me.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]  Joel Scalzen, great to be here.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880]  Thank you.
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:40.880]  You've got the floor at least for the next 5-10 minutes before we go to break on why you think this is central to cover and what you think this signifies.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:55.880]  I think the important point that I want to make Alex is that they're trying to turn around the fact that we have made the case that there is a vast mainstream media conspiracy against Donald Trump and against the conservative or at least the constitutional conservative movement.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.880]  They're trying to paint now this conservative media industrial complex.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:08.880]  That's a key word for the military industrial complex, which we've always complained about, you know, controlling wars because it's profitable for people as well as being part of the globalist agenda.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:28.880]  But the key thing is that here in this article in Business Insider where they don't mention you, by the way, you know, they talk about the fact that the whole thing that the Republican establishment has to fight against is they've got to kill this conspiracy movement because it's taking root in what has caused the Donald Trump momentum to come as they realize there are
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:35.880]  a conspiracy of mainstream Republicans to betray the conservative roots and they're trying to kill it.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:46.880]  In this article they admit what you need to do, he's talking to people, is you need to call all the advertisers to Glenn Beck, to Rush Limbaugh, to Sean Hannity and threaten them.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:55.880]  They say in the article you need to threaten them that you're going to be blackballed if you continue to advertise with Fox News or Sean Hannity.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.880]  And obviously Beck knew this purge was coming. That's why he totally got on board a year ago.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:07.880]  That's right. Now the point is this is an admission of conspiracy. I mean Breitbart doesn't have people threatening the advertisers on CNBC.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:19.880]  Rush Limbaugh doesn't send people to threaten NBC or CNN or any of those you see. This is an admission of conspiracy. They're going to try to conspire to destroy the financial base of the...
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:25.880]  And they've already by the way behind the scenes on local AM and FM's not just myself. There's a lot of patriots locally in each town.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:32.880]  No matter how high their ratings, icons in towns, cities have been just taken off the air and they put fake conservatives on just the last year.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:40.880]  Well look at what happened to Michael Savage. I mean they literally took him off the air without any notice whatsoever and he was having a powerful effect.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:58.880]  So there is a mainstream conspiracy against the rising point but I thought it was very interesting that even though they have attacked you directly in certain hit pieces, in this piece in business inside of they failed to mention the power of Alex Jones in producing the type of resistance to the mainstream.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:12.880]  And I really think that you are a... That means the power of our audience and our guest. I'm not trying to defer the praise. It really is the audience. It's the guest. It's this whole operation that in many cases I'm probably one of the least effective things.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:20.880]  But that's how God works on the system I've built. But expanding on that, they had a Washington Post in a New York Times article that said the same thing in the last week.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:33.880]  That quote Breitbart and Info Wars have had a insurrection of the Republican Party and a hostile takeover was the headline and have now taken it over so you better kick them out or it's over for your party.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:42.880]  That's what they actually said. That's what they're saying. In fact that's why they want a landslide. They want an engineering landslide for Hillary Clinton so they can say to all that you see this is what happens when you listen to Alex Jones.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.880]  This is what happens when you believe these phony conspiracy theories.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:59.880]  How do we counter that? Well one of the things that we have to get people to do on our side is to really be careful about what they listen to because they are feeding phony conspiracies into the mix.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:09.880]  We even accidentally had one that I caught and took down that was linked to another article that said that the Russians had basically infiltrated Alaska. That got up on the side.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:17.880]  That's right. And I try in the World Affairs Brief, I almost cover once a week at least two or three little stories that need to be debunked.
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:29.880]  For example there was a story about jets taking off in San Diego with Afterburner. Of course they don't realize that all jets take off in Afterburner even in regular circumstance.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.880]  They talk about booms being heard. They talked about the same thing in Seattle and it's just bogus.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:44.880]  I mean there are people feeding this kind of stuff and they talked about the Russians putting out a call that all the families are going to be called home in England and the United States or prelude to war and it wasn't true.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:52.880]  Nobody got called home and of course it was a Russian source that put this out so that people thought it must be true but in fact it wasn't true.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:17:01.880]  So there's all kinds of things that feed and you go around and share these things with people and they get discredited and that's what they want to do is so that when they hear true conspiracies.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:11.880]  They don't know how to navigate them. Well I've caught a lot of sites that we know are government corporate connected where they just spew disinfo all day and then mix our info into it so that people get confused and distracted.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:20.880]  But I think we've reached a point, Joe Scalzen, where the mainstream media is so discredited and people are even wise to that that this tactic isn't working.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:29.880]  So if they do try to steal this election and try to then discredit the Liberty Movement, they failed and break it but now they're threatening to basically destroy the UK financially if they don't go along with it.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.880]  What's the next shooting route then if they do steal the election?
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:42.880]  Well they have to deal with the fact that the Trump movement, the populist movement, Ron Paul built the movement by twice when he ran for president and Donald Trump has doubled it again.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.880]  Or more.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:55.880]  Or more because he's brought in populism. You know, Ron Paul was a very principled conservative movement, constitutional conservative movement and Ron Paul has expanded that to a populist dissatisfaction with the media which is extremely widespread.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:06.880]  It's the largest phenomenon that we've seen and even David Brooks and Mark Shields on NPR were talking about the fact, you know, what really worries me is the fact that people hate us.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.880]  And he says this is the first time we've ever faced this as the establishment media is that people hate us.
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:20.880]  Yeah, they're not the goofy liberals anymore. We know they're organized, shy-op officers getting talking points by multinational corporations working against our republic.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.880]  Yes, that's right.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.880]  What are they going to do when we're getting, no exaggeration now, 50 million views on different video platforms a week?
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:33.880]  I mean, what are they going to do now that there's mom and pops popping up that get videos with 20 million views?
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:39.880]  I mean, our movement is just exploding right now. They've got to be in panic mode.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:43.880]  They are in panic mode and that's why the censorship is rising. I mean, Google is censoring thing.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.880]  You can't do a search on gun rights without getting skewed to gun control. I did it myself.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:51.880]  Before I came on, you type in gun rights and gun control, gun control.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.880]  They're taking the gloves off.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:57.880]  They're really, you know, really trying to screw. This is a China type censorship of the Internet.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:04.880]  They're talking about on Facebook, which they're already, you know, censoring many people about taking down anything that can be construed as hate speech.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.880]  And they're going to say that everything you or I put out is hate speech. And so it's going to be censored.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.880]  Oh, that's what the paper, both papers said that that I'm like this king of hate.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.880]  They're the ones saying I'm racist because I don't like Obamacare. They're the ones saying I should be locked up.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.880]  They're the ones demonizing. They're the ones coming after us.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.880]  Yeah, they have a powerful way to what I call the media drumbeat.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.880]  I mean, it's just like the imbalance between the sins of Donald Trump and of Hillary Clinton.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:37.880]  I mean, look at the balance of the thing. You have credible people talking about, you know, Donald Trump making advances with them.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.880]  I think they're fairly credible and except for the one person on the airliner because Donald Trump never did fly in an economy class.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:50.880]  But the point is, there are credible women who talk about Hillary Clinton sniffing cocaine.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.880]  There are, you know, women talking about her lesbian and bisexual relationship and it never gets anything in the press.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.880]  It's not fair.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.880]  It's just not fair. And that is manipulation of the election. That is manipulation.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:08.880]  I mean, it starts, for example, in the primary season, it starts when I was a political scientist and, you know,
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:14.880]  they were going to run the Democrats against George H.W. Bush and they said, who are the top Democrats?
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.880]  And then all of a sudden, Bill Clinton of Arkansas and I said, who? Who's Bill Clinton?
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:25.880]  I mean, I said, political scientist. I was watching him and nobody knew who Bill Clinton was except that the media was saying he's one of the top picks for the Democrats.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.880]  Well, says who? That's the way that they manipulate this.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:37.880]  Now, when you have people like Mitt Romney and Donald Trump insert themselves in the political process with their own money, that is what has skewed the system.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:43.880]  They've been able to break through the kingmaker appointed system that has been ruling America for so long.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.880]  Ronald Reagan broke through it because of the very sheer charisma and his true conservative prowess that he had.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:55.880]  But of course, they put him in a locker hold when they forced him to take George H.W. Bush.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.880]  And they shot him.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.880]  And then they shot him to make a real believer out of him.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.880]  So we've had a very controlled election.
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:07.880]  They wanted to give us, in this election, a controlled Republican. Donald Trump stopped that.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:14.880]  And despite his flaws, you know, this nation has got to realize that Hillary Clinton, her type of corruption is different than Donald Trump's.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.880]  Her type of corruption is systematic. It's within the system.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.880]  It's organized.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.880]  It's organized.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.880]  She has a complete team of people who...
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.880]  And she represents the very central core of globalists.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.880]  I mean, she represents the creme de la creme of evil.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.880]  Even though she isn't one of the top planners of the globalists, she is a puppet like Barack Obama.
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.880]  She takes orders and things.
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.880]  I mean, there are people like Henry Kissinger and other people...
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.880]  Oh, I agree. Well, she admits she says I take my orders from the Council of Foreign Relations.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.880]  And Henry Kissinger is just like General Jones said.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.880]  Yeah, General Jones made that admission in 2009 at the Munich Security Conference.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:49.880]  He gets his daily marching orders from Henry Kissinger passed down...
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:57.880]  So how do they deal with this paradox, though, where they're announcing global carbon taxes, taxing by the mile, the family's bad, world government's here,
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:01.880]  but Alex Jones is insane, Obamacare is free.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.880]  I mean, how do they sit there and continue to get away with this?
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.880]  Because they have less and less credibility.
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:16.880]  The real core problem, Alex, is that they're dealing with a rising consciousness within a...
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:25.880]  I'm afraid to say this, but it still is, I think, a slight majority compared to the dumbed-down electorate and the benefit-corrupted people which are growing.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.880]  I mean, I...
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.880]  I agree, but the slight majority doesn't know it still has the power and it thinks it's a minority.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.880]  That's right. And they still continue to call themselves the minority, the beleaguered minority oppressed.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.880]  And that's what the Business Insider tried to oppress by this mainstream or this big monolithic...
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880]  Which it is.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880] ...organization.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:49.880]  We have the Clinton Foundation from their library documents that Judicial Watch got and World End Daily got a few years ago.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.880]  Thousands of pages and it's like, we can't let a new press grow.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.880]  We must suppress it ever getting its funding.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.880]  We have to call it a conspiracy of right-wingers and shut it down.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:59.880]  We have to stick the IRS on it.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.880]  I mean, it's an admission of criminal activity against us.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.880]  But it also shows how worried they are, Alex.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.880]  I mean, they really are worried.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.880]  They wouldn't be attacking Donald Trump to the degree that they are if they weren't worried about him winning.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.880]  I mean, that shows that despite all of the disadvantage we've had for so many years,
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.880]  the movement has grown exponentially.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.880]  Your efforts, Donald Trump's efforts and otherwise.
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.880]  And so, despite the flaws, they are worried about this.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]  They're worried about Europe.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]  I mean, Europe is a major revolt.
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:26.880]  All 25 EU nations are moving to pull out.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880]  That's right.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.880]  And Brexit is a success.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.880]  But they're trying to sabotage it, putting in Theresa May.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.880]  And she is sabotaging.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:37.880]  I pointed out in the World Affairs Brief that she put in this bill before Congress
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:42.880]  that inculcates all EU law into British law.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.880]  Everything.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.880]  In other words, we're pulling out of breakfast.
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.880]  We're going to put in British law.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:53.880]  And so there will no longer be under the jurisdiction of the World International Court.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.880]  But the point is, if it's in British law, that means the British courts have to enforce EU law.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:23:59.880]  Well, let's talk about this then.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:01.880]  When was the John Burr Society founded?
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880]  1956.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.880]  Okay, so let's say 1956.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.880]  Let's say the number of people away is pretty low.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.880]  I mean, the public general was more moral, but it was a low amount.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.880]  Would you agree that was aware of the conspiracy?
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.880]  That's right.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:18.880]  You know, let's say in 2016, it's exponential and it seems to be going straight up.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:23.880]  If you guys are going to document cam, I can show people this crude graph.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.880]  I mean, do you basically agree with that graph?
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880]  Absolutely.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:27.880]  So what do they do?
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:29.880]  They're going to bring in authoritarianism very quickly.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:32.880]  They start shutting down the press basically in the next year.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.880]  I think they have to be careful with that, though.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:37.880]  They want to make sure that people stay fat, dumb, and happy.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880]  No, no, I agree with you.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.880]  But I'm saying then that gives us more time.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.880]  I mean, aren't they screwed either way?
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.880]  They are, and that's why ultimately they're going to bring us a war,
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.880]  because war gives them the excuse to suppress any dissent.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.880]  And it's going to be ruthless.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.880]  You haven't seen anything until war comes and when they can have a wartime agenda.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:59.880]  I mean, look at that false patriotism that is enjoined when war comes.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.880]  And clearly, you know, nobody's laughing about my predictions about Russia and China
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880]  being the aggressor against the United States and Russia.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.880]  They've been saying for 20 years.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.880]  I mean, for 20 years.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:08.880]  Now it's materializing.
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.880]  It's coming true and nobody's laughing anymore.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.880]  And the trouble is we've got too much hype about it being coming too early.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.880]  I think I'm convinced, and I think we'll talk about this a later time.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880]  You know, I think it takes more time.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.880]  Russia and China really are ready.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.880]  Listen, I hope you're right that it's in six, seven, you know, five years or whatever.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.880]  I hope it never happens.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  But clearly, we see it's that direction.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.880]  But I'm not saying you're wrong, but look at how Syria popped up and Putin did something.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:31.880]  We didn't think it would happen.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.880]  They admit they're not ready.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880]  I had Colonel Schrafer on.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.880]  He said, our military's not ready yet.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.880]  So clearly neither military wants it and they're talking to each other.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:44.880]  But the elites tend to be pretty unstable.
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.880]  Yes.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.880]  But they need this war to ultimately lock down the opposition.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.880]  There's nothing that's going to stop this growing opposition.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.880]  Nothing Alec.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.880]  And that's why they're ahead of time branding any opposition to the establishment as being
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:57.880]  Russian agents.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.880]  So when this war comes, they can grab whatever they want.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.880]  Black balled Russia already, but at the same time, the US is still trying to do another
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.880]  disarmament agreement with Russia.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.880]  I mean, talk about hypocrisy.
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:12.880]  Blaming Donald Trump for being a Russian agent, you see, and Russia's hacking it.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.880]  And yet the same administration is still trying to negotiate another Russian disarmament agreement.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.880]  Well, look at look at Podesta, his brother and all the money and Hillary involved and
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.880]  all this coming out.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:23.880]  Well, sure.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:27.880]  And you look at, you know, the Hillary Clinton pay for play and Haiti, all of the friends
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.880]  of Hillary Clinton that got these big contracts and nothing to do with refugee release.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.880]  Relief.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.880]  What do you think's wrong with Hillary looking at her?
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:38.880]  I mean, clearly she was in and out of the hospital in 2002 and 2013 and 2012.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.880]  The word is she's got serious neurological problems.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.880]  Secret services said start watching her a month later.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.880]  She fell down.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.880]  She looks really bad.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.880]  Then she looks okay.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.880]  What's happening?
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.880]  Well, it's kind of interesting.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.880]  She has hypothyroid.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:55.880]  Hypothyroid leads to a tremendous amount of susceptibility to other diseases, heart disease, cancer,
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.880]  which we saw that she had a cancerous growth on her tongue excise.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.880]  So she is susceptible to cancer.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.880]  But I think she's actually got a form of Parkinson's disease.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:08.880]  I've talked to several doctors who confirm that what we're seeing is probably the reaction
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.880]  to some of her Parkinson's type drugs that she's taking.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  It tends to calm the nervous system, and yet at some point it causes a hyper-nervous
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.880]  response to things when you see the head jerking and the other things that happen.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.880]  But you know, she is still pretty strong when she is hyped up on whatever drugs they keep her on.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.880]  Oh, she looks like she's on amphetamines.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:36.880]  And she is also taking a lot of skin rejuvenating type things, not Botox particularly.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.880]  But for all those wrinkles that disappear on the debate, she had to have a lot of cosmetic.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]  Sure.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  What about blood transfusions?
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.880]  Some of the elite do a lot of those.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.880]  I can't say whether she's using that.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:51.880]  But I know that she's being pumped up by a lot of medical intervention.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:54.880]  And that's why it fails at certain points and she collapses.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:28:00.880]  But I don't think her problems are chronic enough to keep her from acting as president.
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.880]  And they're going to keep her propped up is my feeling.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.880]  And they probably like that even more that she's degrading because that gives them even more control.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.880]  Yeah, and they can also mean like Richard Nixon.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:13.880]  They kept him hyped up on drugs and load on drugs so that Henry Kissinger continued to run the administration.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.880]  That was revealed by one of the insiders in the Nixon administration.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.880]  Joel, you wanted to get some into Russia and also what's happening in Syria.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.880]  I mean, we now know that our military to a great extent did not want to go along with backing ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:31.880]  But hopefully you can break down some of the angles and factions of how this is happening.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:42.880]  You also pointed out that there's a report that they're pulling the U.S. troops out of one area of Mosul and other areas so that some of the ISIS people can get out.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.880]  So I want to get your World Affairs Brief.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.880]  You're the editor of World Affairs Brief.com, obviously, on your best intel from your sources and research where that whole conflict is.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:56.880]  Because obviously, that's the doorway to bring in all these Islamists into Europe and the U.S.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:59.880]  And that's the next question we'll start answering now in 30 seconds.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.880]  What is really behind bringing in all these radical jotties?
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:09.880]  In Europe, it is, of course, to create absolute conflict and that's what's happened.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.880]  Sweden has been destroyed by these men.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:18.880]  In the United States, they've used the Mexican immigration to basically dilute conservative voting power in the United States.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:24.880]  And that's really worked. I mean, they are going to, it's not just 11 million that they're going to legalize when Hillary takes office.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.880]  It's going to be 30 to 40 million. And I don't think we'll ever win another election again.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.880]  Who will then be branded thinking, hey, I'm a liberal, that's my friend.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.880]  And there's just no way for patriots to reach out.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.880]  I guess I'm trying to wake up that historically conservative family-wise group.
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:41.880]  Absolutely true.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:46.880]  And that's why the globalists are so arrogant and now reversing into pure race-based politics.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.880]  We'll be back with Joel Scousen on Alex Jones.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.880]  This is happening right in front of us.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.880]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.880]  Government chills are campaigning for Clinton.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.880]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:35.880]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.880]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.880]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:44.880]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.880]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on election day.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:51.880]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:57.880]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.880]  Wear red on election day and make America great again.
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:16.880]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down.
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.880]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.880]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.880]  I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.880]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like being everything just kind of clears up.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.880]  Got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:40.880]  Find out why third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:44.880]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:50.880]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[01:31:50.880 --> 01:32:00.880]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:25.880]  It was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:31.880]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.880]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:38.880]  We're the solution. Americans, ain't nothing more to it than that.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:50.880]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels and Special Offs General, Jerry Boykin, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:56.880]  Revelation, the movie, dot info. Americans need to see this film.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:33:17.880]  Revelation, the movie, dot info. Let's fix it.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:32.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:46.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have our living defense product that is the harmful organism cleanse that's all the old lifestyle herbs and things, and then also high tech compounds that are natural and healthy to flush out the body of parasites.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:54.880]  You've heard listeners call in, it's got five star reviews, it's sold out most of the time because it's so hard to source this formula because it's got so many things in it.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:59.880]  And everything we sell, we shoot for California standards, which are nearly impossible.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:07.880]  So we keep testing with the third parties that produce it, some of the biggest organic labs in the country to bring you living defense.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:13.880]  It's available right now at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com again as the umbrella shopping cart.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:25.880]  We also have a special that's about to end 25% off on BrainForce, the healthy, new tropic that's got compounds in it that help boost your mental abilities, more stamina, you name it.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:32.880]  I personally, also, like the supermail vitality Anthroplex is just basically a dry formula of that.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.880]  We have our biome defense probiotic seven years in the making.
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.880]  This is the stuff that they're selling in clinics in Europe.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.880]  Okay, we have a big cold facility here.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.880]  It's produced in the top lab in the US.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.880]  We went and said we want total Rolls Royce.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:55.880]  Root was doing this seven years ago, but he could never get it until now. And it's two different strengths, 50 billion live and active cultures, 25 million live and active cultures shipped to you in a cold pack.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:00.880]  This is because look, I could come out and private label hundreds of different probiotics.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:02.880]  Okay, this is the best.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.880]  You go to Whole Foods, they've got Rolls Royce type stuff that cost more than this that isn't even as good.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.880]  This is what I take is what my family takes.
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:10.880]  It is amazing.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.880]  Try it out for yourself and know you're funding this operation.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:22.880]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:29.880]  Now, also, you can get on DVD, the documentary presentation.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:37.880]  It's over three hours long and that is strategic relocation to film and the big color book that Joel Scowsen published at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:45.880]  And believe me, it is the best research on the safest places to live in the US, in the world, demographics on politics, and so much more.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.880]  It's incredibly accurate.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:52.880]  And I basically am looking to try to find somewhere new outside Austin to live.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:36:03.880]  And I'm going off of this and quite frankly never got to part two, trying to get Joel to come out here for a few days and travel around with me to try to find the best place where I could still, you know, get it in and out of town.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:11.880]  But I basically lived during the weekend because I've gone from believing it's a probability we're going to have societal collapse to a certainty.
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:15.880]  The question is how and at what order and why.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:16.880]  But the globalists want it.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.880]  They don't want civilization for the general public.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.880]  That's their plan.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:23.880]  And they're orchestrating this long-term collapse and war.
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:32.880]  And so I am moving from being somewhat prepared to totally prepared because my kids come first and I've politically tried to fix this as much as I can.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  And we still are.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.880]  You know, we've got a lot of hope.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.880]  Good things are happening.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:38.880]  But we're up against very, very evil people.
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.880]  WorldAffairsBrief.com is his excellent news site.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.880]  Again, Joel Scalsen is our guest here in studio.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:59.880]  Joel, we had some nice banner in the last 30 minutes, but big picture geopolitically with what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening in Central Asia, what's happening with Russia, Ukraine.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.880]  Can you give us an analysis on that?
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:12.880]  And then I know you wanted to get specifically into Syria and, yeah, Turkey, which has always been part of NATO, at least since World War II or the end of World War II, cozying up to Russia.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.880]  What's going on there?
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:21.880]  Well, first of all, in the big picture, it's very important to realize that there are three major predator centers in the world.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.880]  They're the Anglo-American globalists that we're fighting.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.880]  There's the Russians and the Chinese.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:29.880]  All three of them want to establish a global new world order controlled by them.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:32.880]  Now, the Russians and Chinese are temporarily in alliance.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.880]  They'll know they'll eventually have to go at each other, but they want to join together, first of all, to take down the West.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.880]  Now, they don't want to destroy the Western economy.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:47.880]  That's why they're planning on a nuclear preemptive strike on U.S. military forces so they can blackmail the West into submission.
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.880]  Now, our globalists know this.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.880]  They know that the Russians and Chinese aren't intending to nuke cities, but going after the military.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:59.880]  They're going to let that happen, and that's why PDD 60 was signed by President Clinton in 1997,
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.880]  basically instructing our nuclear forces, don't rely on launch on warning,
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:07.880]  but prepare to absorb a nuclear first strike and then retaliate afterwards.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.880]  And General Butch Neil and Marine Corps had to retaliate with what?
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.880]  Once you absorb a nuclear first strike.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:17.880]  Now, it's true that our military still continues to practice launch on warning.
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:23.880]  Launch on warning is very important because it means that when our satellites detect Russian and Chinese launching against us,
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.880]  that if they launch our missiles while theirs are in the air.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:28.880]  It's mad.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.880]  Their missiles, no, it's not a mad, it's not a total destruction.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:37.880]  What it is is their missiles hit empty silos, our missiles are in the air, and hit active targets.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:38.880]  So the one who launched.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.880]  I understand because we know which silos have launched and which are about to launch.
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:42.880]  That's right.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:46.880]  So launch on warning, it means that the one who launches second wins.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:53.880]  And when our military says, when our government says to them, don't rely on launch on warning, but prepare to absorb a nuclear first strike.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.880]  It means they're not going to get the launch codes.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:57.880]  They still practice it.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:00.880]  They still think they're going to be able to do it, but those codes won't come.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.880]  That's why they can't afford to have them.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:03.880]  And they admit that's the case.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:05.880]  So why has Congress allowed this to happen?
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:06.880]  Because they don't know about it.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.880]  Nobody talks about PDD 60 because first of all, it's still secret.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.880]  I published in the World Appearance.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:12.880]  Sure.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.880]  But even the cover page admits it.
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:15.880]  I mean, I mean, they have a summary that's public.
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.880]  Yeah, but it's never been discussed in Congress.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.880]  I've looked.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:19.880]  They've never discussed it.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:24.880]  But they made movies arguing, well, we've got to do this because we can't let, you know, crazy submarine commanders nuke everybody.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.880]  Well, that's what they're saying is the excuse.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:38.880]  In fact, in the same year, 1997, President Clinton agreed unilaterally to keep 50% of our submarines imported any one time to make them more vulnerable to a Russian attack to prove that we have no hostile intentions.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:39.880]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:44.880]  If you're going to be belligerent to Russia and try to start a war, why then put yourself in a posture that says attack us?
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.880]  Because the U.S. can't start this war.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.880]  They've got to be the victim.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:50.880]  They've got to be the victim.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:51.880]  And this is important.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.880]  So they can come out of their bunkers, our leaders and say, we've been victimized.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.880]  Now, we've talked about this a lot on air and I agree with you.
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.880]  That's the way the world's going.
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.880]  And you're dead on target with World Affairs Brief.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.880]  Here's the problem.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.880]  It's a fact that national Russian TV watches us.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880]  I don't want to brag about this.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.880]  I knew it 10 years ago.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.880]  It's not just them trying to be friendly and manipulate us.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:11.880]  It's true.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.880]  A lot of the Russian intelligentsia listens to this show.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.880]  They watch it.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.880]  I was told this by the head of RT America like eight years ago, nine years ago.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:23.880]  I've been told by other high-level folks that have been over to Russia and have actually met with Putin.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:30.880]  And of course, they play clips of my show on national Russian TV that Putin's best buddy, you know, heads up the Russian state media.
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.880]  And it sounds like Alex Jones now.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.880]  And they're doing all this stuff, paying people to have kids, not letting them push the anti-family agenda in schools.
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:41.880]  Again, I understand that it's still got all that old hard-line stuff.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:47.880]  I'm not trying to say that they're the good guys, but I mean, is it possible Russia could actually understand what's happening and not be manipulated into this?
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:48.880]  They don't believe me.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:49.880]  That's the problem.
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:50.880]  But they're watching.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.880]  I know.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:52.880]  But they don't believe me.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.880]  They think that the U.S. is going to try to nuke them.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.880]  They think the U.S. is going to try to trick them.
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:58.880]  Okay.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:40:59.880]  Okay.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:00.880]  We'll talk to Russia right now.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:01.880]  Camera four.
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.880]  Full scouts.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.880]  Go ahead.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.880]  What I'm trying to tell them is they're being set up for a trap.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.880]  They know that you're only going to hit American military forces.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:21.880]  They actually want American military forces to be taken down because they have secret weapons systems that they're going to bring out after that first strike to keep any further nuclear weapons from falling while they regroup and talk us into joining a militarized global government.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.880]  We've got a paper global government in the U.N.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:31.880]  It's going to be militarized with taxation, all of the draconian things, martial law that you've always talked about will come true when there's a war.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:32.880]  And that's why all the stuff's been set up.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:33.880]  That's right.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.880]  But they're not ready.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.880]  In order to induce, Russia and China aren't ready yet.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:39.880]  In order to induce them to strike, they have to feign weakness.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:41.880]  That's the old Chinese proverb.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:42.880]  And that's why we're disarming.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:47.880]  That's why we took three warheads off our minimum and three missiles and reduced them to one.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:50.880]  That's a, you know, a two-thirds disarmament, unilaterally.
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.880]  While engaging in provocations.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  Okay.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.880]  How about this?
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:01.880]  How about this Philippine leaders running to China, meeting with the president, getting all these honors when the U.S. president lands, they make them come off the back of the plane, yell at him.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.880]  I mean, what are those snubs about?
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:10.880]  Well, Duterte actually is a radical leftist populist and he is naturally inclined to the Russians.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.880]  And that's why he's kind of thumbing his nose at the United States.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:17.880]  However, the Philippine people are still pro-American and they will want to.
[01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:23.880]  But I think that we can see, you know, Philippines make a deal with China so they don't get invaded.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:28.880]  I think China in this next war, the beginning of the next war, got a grudge match against Japan.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.880]  I think they're going to launch against Japan.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.880]  They'll take Japan all the way down through Australia.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.880]  They own all of the middle rights in Australia.
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:36.880]  They have to occupy Australia.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:41.880]  That's why Australia is not a good strategic relocation, you know, place for Americans.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:48.880]  Just like the Japanese had to take that whole arc of violence, so China will do that at the beginning of the war.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.880]  And they've got the troops to do it.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:57.880]  But my theory is that the globalists will make a deal with China in World War III to cut a deal to betray Russia.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:03.880]  Well, clearly that's been the plan, at least since they opened up the talks in the 70s.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:08.880]  So I think Russia will be eliminated in World War III and then China becomes the new Cold War enemy.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.880]  And the globalists want that because then they can say, we can't disarm this great big global military we built
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:17.880]  because we need to have a defense against this new Cold War enemy.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.880]  And ensure the peace.
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:25.880]  Well, clearly the globalists, the Anglo-American establishment have sided with China.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:30.880]  They've been given most of the big ports, the Panama Canal, 98% of rare earth minerals now.
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:37.880]  They've been given a strategic leg up and the CFR folks say it's the Chinese century on and on and on.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.880]  They're allowed to infiltrate their spies.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:46.880]  Russia, on the other hand, has been encircled, having sanctions put on it, is being infiltrated.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.880]  Soros has been trying to overthrow it.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.880]  I mean, wouldn't they rather just overthrow it early instead of having to have the nuclear war?
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.880]  No, they want the conflict.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.880]  They have to have something as dramatic.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.880]  So trying to overthrow publicly and Soros bragging about it, he is meant to just stir Russia up.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:02.880]  Yes, exactly.
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:09.880]  You see, you've got to remember that they have to allow Putin to go before his people and appear that Russia is the victim.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:15.880]  You know, take advantage of Russian resurgent nationalism about what we want to research as a powerful nation and as a world power.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:22.880]  And so by having, by the globalists, providing a lot of antagonism, military exercises on the border, threats of NATO and so on.
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:27.880]  And Trump ends all that because he's being advised by General Flynn and others, and that too is mainly advising him.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:29.880]  Former head of defense intelligence saying, don't do that.
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.880]  And it looks like Flynn's a pretty smart cookie. What do you know about him?
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.880]  Yeah, I think he is right. He knows it's a no reason to provoke Russia.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.880]  And the provocation of Russia is not to start a nuclear war.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:42.880]  The provocation is to give Putin an excuse to go before his people and look like the victim.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.880]  And you've been saying the Russians aren't listening. I don't know that's the case.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.880]  No, I'm saying they don't believe me.
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.880]  Exactly. They're listening what they're not listening.
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:55.880]  But I know our military is and I don't want to get lionized them because Lord knows the army and people are, you know,
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.880]  that's who buries the bodies and does the hanging.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:01.880]  But I mean, I've just found the army more than any other group is super awake.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:03.880]  The Marines are super awake.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:05.880]  Natives somewhat, but not so much.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.880]  The leaders aren't though. The leaders are politically correct.
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:08.880]  They've been trained at these.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:15.880]  No, I understand they had to remove a bunch of people because they've done with transgenders and allowing the feminists into the middle.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.880]  They've feminized our military.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.880]  Those are litmus tests to get it set up.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.880]  But still, they haven't fully conquered it.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:23.880]  That's got a concern, the establishment.
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:29.880]  It does. It's because the mid-grade field level officers and below read your stuff.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:30.880]  They understand what the threat is.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.880]  They're very anti-establishment.
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:34.880]  They're very anti-Hillary Clinton, in fact.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.880]  They know that.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.880]  I call them super aware.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.880]  They're super aware.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:43.880]  But the leaders of all of the major services, including the Joint Chiefs, are all lacking.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.880]  Sure. How did you go to the Marine Corps before?
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:51.880]  Oh, actually, I got out as a captain. They wouldn't have someone in me who was not going to toe the line.
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:58.880]  In fact, I got knocked out of my squadron because I wouldn't go to stag nude parties where they had prostitutes.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:03.880]  All this was before the Navy tailhook scandal where that got clamped down on.
[01:46:03.880 --> 01:46:05.880]  But I was given an unsatisfactory...
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:07.880]  So you wouldn't cheat on your wife, so that was it?
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.880]  Right. I was given an unsatisfactory fitness report on loyalty to Skipper because I wouldn't go to these parties.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.880]  And when I did a congressional investigation afterwards, the Marine Corps said there is no such fitness report.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:25.880]  They had sent another one emergency to OIA to get the Skipper to sign it again and replaced it with an excellent fitness report.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:30.880]  I mean, that's the kind of cover-up that went back, you know, clear in the 1970s.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.880]  Well, if that got you out early, you could start this fight.
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.880]  That's right. And it was a godsend because this is where I'm really comfortable...
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:42.880]  And you ended up leading kind of the proto-T party, the first big move to try to save the Republican Party.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:49.880]  That's right. I was chairman of the conservative national committee in Washington D.C. during the Reagan administration to put pressure on the Reagan administration to stop these conferences.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:59.880]  By the way, the conservative national committee, there's been a left-wing financed conspiracy theory that I worked for that and that it secretly runs the country when I wish it did.
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:06.880]  We wouldn't be on this situation, but it's crazy how they, now we know in the WikiLeaks, they create their own conspiracy theories that are made up.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:08.880]  They do. They talked about...
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:14.880]  You said we're running this big combine. We've got to be shut down. We're the conspiracy.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:23.880]  Yeah, isn't that interesting? It's so ironic. The conspiracy calling the non-conspirators black. It's just incredible.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.880]  Wow. Okay. Getting into Syria now. How is that going for the globalists?
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:45.880]  The backstory is very, very important on this. The reason we got into Syria was the fact that... Remember in the 19... Well, 2004, 2008, the U.S. had three carrier groups offshore Iran threatening to start a war over this program.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:56.880]  Well, it turned out that Israel refused to start that war. They were going to fly an attack in there and bomb Iranian nuclear reactors, and then the U.S. would come in and finish the job.
[01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:05.880]  But Iran... But Israel told the U.S. we're not going to do this until you take out Syria, because they're right on our border. They have thousands of missiles, chemical weapons.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:12.880]  They can obliterate us if we start a war with Iran. So the U.S. agreed to take Syria out three years ago. Remember that?
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.880]  And for Israel, that's smart, because they don't want a two-front war.
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:22.880]  That's right. And so they had this no-fly zone, which is not just a no-fly zone. It's like Libya. It's where you're going to have cruise missiles and everything coming in.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:31.880]  And what happened is, John Kerry got before a London press conference, and a very savvy reporter said, hey, it's obvious you're going to invade Syria.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:40.880]  Is there any way, anything that Syria can do to stop this? And John Kerry just off the top of it said, yeah, they could give up the chemical weapons, and we wouldn't be able to attack.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:46.880]  And Syria said, we accept. And Russia said, we accept for Syria. And so all of a sudden, it stopped the globalist agenda cold.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:52.880]  They couldn't go through with the no-fly zone, because they agreed to come in and...
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:58.880]  Then they get the red line, but the jihadis funded out of Saudi Arabia were so dumb, they filmed trophy videos of them launching the chemical attacks.
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:01.880]  And then even the UN had to admit it was really basically Saudi Arabia.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:07.880]  The U.S. tried to falsify that Assad was using chemical weapons. I mean, why would he do that? He knew that they were trying to get after him.
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:09.880]  You don't use chemical weapons in the middle of a city.
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:10.880]  Anyways.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.880]  I mean, because it's an area weapon.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:13.880]  It's a battlefield weapon.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.880]  It's an area weapon. You know, you can't just target people like that. So it was stupid.
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:21.880]  Nobody would believe in the military that Assad would use chemical weapons.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:24.880]  But it came in from Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It was old, sour and gas.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:27.880]  It was given to the rebels to do and to blame it on Assad.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:34.880]  But the point is, once they couldn't get into Syria, they had to create ISIS.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.880]  And this is the real way that ISIS created. It has nothing to do with pulling out of Iraq too early.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:47.880]  It has to do with the fact that it took about 50% of the Syrian rebels, which they were financing and running, through Saudi Arabia using Israeli Mossad agents.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.880]  And they said, you're now ISIS. How else do you explain a 50,000...
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.880]  Well, they admit that.
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:50:01.880]  They changed the name and then brought in proxy armies and then resupplied them in that new area that's part of eastern Iraq and western Syria.
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.880]  That's right. And that is why. And the proof is this.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:10.880]  Why, when Iraq called the U.S. and said, look, there's these weapons depots out there. There's a massive armed force getting ready to attack us.
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.880]  We want you to bomb this. And the U.S. refused because they knew it was our people that they were doing.
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:21.880]  But then the new media exposed that, our own military protested, and so they kind of halfway backed off.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:24.880]  Well, they just became a little more careful. I mean, it's like in Mosul.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:31.880]  You know, in the invasion of Mosul by the armies and the Iraqi army left, they had a big victory parade down a major highway out of Mosul.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:35.880]  And the U.S. military knew about it. They didn't attack it. Why wouldn't they attack it?
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.880]  Because it was a convoy of ISIS that they didn't... they wanted preserved.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:45.880]  When Fallujah was retaken, they allowed all the ISIS fighters to escape with their weapons.
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:50.880]  Specified. And in Mosul, they're doing the same thing. They open up the whole western...
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.880]  So now it's happening again. What's the next step there with Joe Scow?
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:57.880]  Stay there. We're going to break World Affairs Brief.com. I'm Alan Sheldon with infowars.com.

[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:06.880]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein. In my 20s, I abused stimulant and anabolic steroids at the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:09.880]  I suffered from extreme fatigue and inability to handle stress.
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:16.880]  For over six years, I had been taking adrenal supplements including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:20.880]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:29.880]  Now, just after one month on Synergy 1 and ADR Medics, I truly feel rejuvenated. I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement.
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:36.880]  I did just ten minutes after taking ADR Medics. I then noticed Synergy 1 made me wake up rested and with much more energy.
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:44.880]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising. I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:48.880]  But now, I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy 1 and ADR Medics.
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:58.880]  Success happens with Synergistic Nutrition. Call 888-988-3325 or visit 1worldway.com. That's 1worldwhey.com.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:37.880]  So, Calvin is our guest here in studio for another 30 minutes and then we have the folks from Project Veritas joining us on their latest video.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:45.880]  Hillary Clinton approved Robert Kramer plan directly. Yes, Hillary micromanages this stuff to go out and steal the votes.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.880]  Go out and engage in disinformation. All the incredible Project Veritas info.
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:54.880]  Now, they've not told us yet what the big crisis was Friday and they don't run around with cry wolf stuff.
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:58.880]  They were really concerned. They're like, we may have to get you videos in case something bad happens.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:05.880]  And I said, what is it? Well, the worst ever. He's been arrested. He's been charged before. They've come after him.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:08.880]  I mean, Project Veritas has a lot of courage. So, I don't know what that was. They haven't told us.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:16.880]  A lot of times, you know, people then decide to batten down the hatches, but we'll try to dig it out of them coming up in about 35 minutes from now.
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:24.880]  But the latest video is up on infowars.com. And of course, Breitbart.com has that as well.
[01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:29.880]  There's another one, racist social justice warriors terrorize owners of cat sanctuary.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.880]  I'm not a big cat person, but my youngest daughter wanted a cat.
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:39.880]  So, I said, well, let's go check out cats first and try to get one that's a rescue cat.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  A lot of times we went to this cat sanctuary place in East Austin.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  I'm going off of a side store. This is up on infowars.com to look at cats.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:52.880]  And I said, you know, we're not going to get a cat. Let's give a donation because they got hundreds of these cats are taking care of.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:57.880]  And we finally did get a cat. So, I just know these people. These are like nice liberals.
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:56:04.880]  The communists started protesting and then they glued the door shut, sprayed races, white people all over it.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.880]  And this is how low the communists are. But the point is, this is the same communist group we've had dealings with.
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:17.880]  They're like activating and coming out of their rat holes now to say that a cat sanctuary in East Austin is gentrification when people should want the property values to go up.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:27.880]  I mean, this is class warfare. And what I'm getting at before you get back into Syria and the rest of it is we're seeing all the socialist and communist and black lives matter groups activate.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:31.880]  So, we're going to come back after this quick break and get into the geopolitical and the economy, Joel.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:39.880]  So, briefly, what's the plan? As I mentioned, bringing in the Muslims into Europe, bringing them in here, activating all this let's kill the cops stuff.
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:46.880]  We know there's problems with the cops, but the answer is don't go shoot them in the back of the head. Is that just a good old fashioned destabilization plan or what is it?
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.880]  Well, it's conflict creation. In other words, you create conflicts that you have an excuse to intervene in society.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:58.880]  You have an excuse to intervene for security, take over police departments, mandate controls for racism and other things.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.880]  And of course, intolerance and hatred and you get a federal presence on all police forces.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:07.880]  So, it's intervention in elections by watering down conservative voting powers.
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:13.880]  It's creating distrust between groups. Muslims never integrate well within society. That's what's happening.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:16.880]  And they're so nasty. They go after a cat sanctuary.
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:22.880]  Absolutely. And so, I mean, who? The left should just totally turn against these people.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:28.880]  But I guess by setting the precedent that will even go after a liberal jewel that's actually doing good.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.880]  I mean, what is the point? Because I know this communist group is directed by a board at UT. This is all planned.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:36.880]  They don't do this unless it's ordered.
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:41.880]  Well, I think the worst thing, of course, is the Oklahoma professor that came out and said, we're all racist if you're white.
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:43.880]  You know, just by being white, you're racist.
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:46.880]  Yeah, so they're inculcating into minorities, true racism.
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:52.880]  But it's also the instruction in public schools and public universities going forward that just incredibly changing our society.
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:56.880]  They know what they're doing. Even a conservative state like Utah or Idaho,
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:02.880]  the younger rising generation becoming coming out of socialist oriented universities, public universities.
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:06.880]  And that's why there's the big push by Hillary Clinton to make public education free,
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:12.880]  to make sure that everybody goes through the propaganda of the leftist left socialism that comes out of the universities.
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.880]  And then you'll have more people demanding more taxes to get their freebie.
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:20.880]  Absolutely. You increase this benefit-corrupted majority.
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:22.880]  And then all of a sudden you can't ever win in a democracy.
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:27.880]  And they're so angry they're mad that the average person in East Austin's property value has skyrocketed.
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:32.880]  And, I mean, they admit the average person that lives there, black, white, Hispanic,
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:35.880]  is getting incredibly successful and wealthy of their own property.
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.880]  But then the communists are there organizing people to go after cat sanctuaries.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:46.880]  We'll be back in 70 seconds. I mean, it's just the level of evil, folks, is hard to imagine.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:59:15.880]  As we're successful, they'll just kill all the cats, you know.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:20.880]  We have refugees spreading disease around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:21.880]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:24.880]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:28.880]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:32.880]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.880]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:38.880]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.880]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:45.880]  And you can support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:47.880]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:47.880 --> 02:00:12.880]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:20.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.880]  All right. Most of our breaks are at the end of the hour and the start of the hour.
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:26.880]  So next time we'll get into the final geopolitical analysis and what's happened in the economy
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:29.880]  with Joe Scowzen, a really smart guy from World Affairs Brief.
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:34.880]  We'll also open the phones up. A few calls for Joe Scowzen, specifically 800-25-99-231.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:40.880]  800-25-99-231, specifically on all the different geopolitical issues, the election.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:43.880]  There's a wide area there, but directly to Joe Scowzen.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:46.880]  The reason I brought up the article that's on infowars.com,
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.880]  racist social justice warriors, terrorized owner of Cat Sanctuary,
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.880]  I happened to have supported this place.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.880]  And I happened to have been over there, and they're nice people.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:59.880]  And my daughters have, you know, cat cafe shirts, and they like cats.
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.880]  Okay, I get it. So we got a cat.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.880]  And so I've been in this place just a month ago, two months ago,
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:08.880]  and they put superglue in the deals. They knocked out windows.
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:10.880]  They put effuge, interfying scum.
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:14.880]  And then they got all these trendies led by the communists and people.
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:17.880]  Honk for justice. Hey, hipster, don't be a bleeper.
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:24.880]  Don't be a, and, you know, basically come out and protest the Cat Sanctuary.
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:29.880]  And to say it's racist because white people came in to set up the Cat Sanctuary.
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:35.880]  Again, it's just so total social warfare. Why?
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:38.880]  I don't have an answer for that. I mean, for liberals to go after a cat,
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:42.880]  saying, I just don't have an answer unless it's just to create conflict
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:45.880]  or get Latinos worked up against whites for any reason whatsoever.
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  But I just don't have a reason for that.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:50.880]  I mean, you think they pick a better target?
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.880]  Absolutely. I don't have an answer for that.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.880]  But I think it's about being low down and nasty.
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:57.880]  Now, now expanding on that, which is only a few months up in the segment,
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:03.880]  specifically, what else do you think Obama's going to try to pull for elaves?
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:15.880]  Well, there's a couple of things that he could do.
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.880]  I'm trying to remember what was on my list that,
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:21.880]  because he didn't make a public statement about it.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:23.880]  Well, imagine the Supreme Court stuff and other.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.880]  Well, he can't go anywhere with that until after the election.
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.880]  But there were some things in trade that he was going to try to do.
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:32.880]  Oh, TPP. That's right.
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:35.880]  He's trying to get that passed before as a lame duck session.
[02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:37.880]  Sure. Yeah.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:40.880]  And the news ran hoax is saying Obama's going to pass it.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:43.880]  Even if Congress does it, they can't.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:45.880]  Well, you know, it depends.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:47.880]  Yeah, I don't think they can at this time.
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:51.880]  Even Paul Ryan isn't willing to accept it at this time.
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:54.880]  And is that because he wants to be more in charge of the dealmaking himself
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:59.880]  after Obama's gone?
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:03.880]  Well, he just can't politically go for TPP while Trump is running.
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:05.880]  How bad is Paul Ryan?
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:12.880]  Well, I think Paul Ryan, when you looked at what he said about his opposition,
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:15.880]  real true right wing opposition that was running against him,
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:17.880]  he got pretty nasty about him.
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:23.880]  So even though Paul Ryan has, I think, a very conservative feeling that he gives to people,
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:26.880]  I think he really is a globalist playing the other side.
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:29.880]  He wouldn't be elected and he wouldn't have elected him Speaker of the House.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:30.880]  Sure.
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:31.880]  He was a controlled.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.880]  Why did Mitt Romney come out against Trump and then flip back to liking Trump?
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:37.880]  I didn't know he did.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:39.880]  He's gone. He's been going back and forth.
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  Well, you know, in Utah, it's a very special situation where they have played to the Mormon view here.
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.880]  There was an anthem at a Trump.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:50.880]  They've given them Evan McMullen, who is an ex CIA covert operative,
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:52.880]  worked for Goldman Sachs CFR.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:53.880]  I mean, he's a globalist.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.880]  We should talk about him when we come back.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:00.880]  I heard him on NPR just dripping with hatred for Trump and NPR groveling to him.
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:01.880]  Yeah.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:02.880]  No, he's a real plant.
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:05.880]  He's meant to destroy the Trump vote in Utah,
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:10.880]  which is the red estate in the union to embarrass Trump to deny him votes.
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:11.880]  But it's terrible.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:16.880]  There's been several articles coming out by Will Greg and others in Utah and Idaho saying,
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:23.880]  you know, Mormons have just been played for fools to go for Evan and Meekum because he's a globalist.
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:27.880]  Well, I heard that guy and he sounded like like a barrel of snakes.
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.880]  He's not a nice person. Not a nice person.
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:32.880]  Anybody's been involved in covert operations. Not nice.
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:36.880]  Well, he admitted that he's basically probably going to get Hillary.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.880]  I mean, that's I mean, he's just there to sabotage.
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:39.880]  That's exactly right.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:44.880]  Well, why would people that are traditionally super conservative and anti-establishment want to be played like that?
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:47.880]  Because they've been played on their moral values.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:55.880]  They're nothing to vote for somebody who's morally corrupt as Donald Trump. They've never been in information about the moral corruptness of Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.880]  They've been absolutely nothing.
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:01.880]  Sure, but it's not even less than two evils. Hillary's a whole other magnitude. We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:08.880]  In a private 2012 board meeting, George Soros said that the rise of money in politics poses a great threat to democracy.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:13.880]  Ironically, his primary role in politics has been a benefactor to corrupt politicos.
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:18.880]  It was coming from a hacked internal document from Soros's Open Society Foundation.
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:20.880]  It was published by DCLeaks this summer.
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:25.880]  Now, including in the DCLeaks dump, were the meetings of this meeting from the OSF board.
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:28.880]  The meeting was attended by OSF staff along with Soros.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.880]  And during the meeting, they were tackling challenges like how best to create a, quote, racial narrative.
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:39.880]  According to the minute, Soros told attendees he believes the rise of money in politics endangers our democracy.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:43.880]  That didn't stop Soros from giving $10 million to a pro-Clinton super PAC,
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:48.880]  or stop him from secretly paying the salaries of four staffers of the Moldovan Prime Minister's office.
[02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:52.880]  Guess when Hillary mentioned all the dark money and getting it out of politics in the last debate,
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:55.880]  she didn't mean people like her BFF, George Soros.
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:06:20.880]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:35.880]  I'm Robert Hall reporting for Infowars.com.
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:06.880]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:09.880]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:15.880]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:21.880]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:24.880]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:26.880]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.880]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:33.880]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:38.880]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:42.880]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount. It's in powder form.
[02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:47.880]  We have so many five-star reviews. I take this. This is the product that I take.
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:54.880]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make. We fight the globalists. We fight the new world order.
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:08:22.880]  Today at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:43.880]  Only 14 days. In fact, about 13 and a half.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:50.880]  I tell you, I have just been sick at my stomach watching the depths that MSM will go to lie and deceive.
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:55.880]  The latest article up on Infowars.com is also on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:59.880]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the newest Podesta emails.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:04.880]  He's being directed directly by Hillary Clinton to engage in criminal actions,
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:10.880]  directing their national coordinators to engage in election fraud and have people vote over and over again.
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.880]  And it gets worse.
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:17.880]  I've never seen election fraud via the polls like this where it's all done by over-sampling.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:20.880]  They're not normally that brazen, but they know the media is under their control.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:24.880]  So they'd rather just have unified, that's what he talks about in the email, unified fraud,
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:27.880]  that the way we're going to skew the polls is over-sampling.
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:33.880]  Oversampling. A lot of times they can just have databases of phones they call where they know it's really Democrats, not Republicans.
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:36.880]  That's also over-sampling. This is just nakedly doing it.
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:40.880]  Those cows that I want to get into geopolitics, finish up with Syria and take some phone calls.
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:49.880]  But just specifically, I mean, I don't think, I think 20% of it is that we know more now about how corrupted it is.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:53.880]  But I think 80% of it is the media and others have gotten more consolidated.
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:57.880]  Look at this whole Time Warner AT&T merger they want to do.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:10:01.880]  And they just know they have nothing to lose now and are more naked than ever.
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:03.880]  And I really see it blowing up in their face.
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:06.880]  But what do you think then about the polls being rigged, admittedly?
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:11.880]  When they come into this election, what happens if they can't steal it because there's a landslide?
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:14.880]  Do they claim Russians were involved in trying to take it from Trump?
[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:16.880]  Or do they just fix it no matter what?
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:20.880]  Because this seems like we're going to the edge of a cliff here in 14 days.
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:24.880]  I don't think Alex there's any way they can let Donald Trump win.
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:26.880]  They simply cannot do it.
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:32.880]  And they have the ability to computerize and manipulate those elections that was proven in the Chicago audit.
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:36.880]  I don't know, I think you covered that the Chicago audit of the Democratic primary.
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:41.880]  They found that almost 20% of the votes were illegally switched by the computer to Hillary Clinton.
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:45.880]  And they changed the audit results rather than admit that there was computer fraud.
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:49.880]  I mean, how can they sit there and mainstream media talk about it and interview all these people?
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:50.880]  There's no election fraud.
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:57.880]  How dare people ever say that when there's actual examples of computer fraud that have been documented by a Chicago audit.
[02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:01.880]  And they sure doctor the result rather than admit that there was.
[02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:06.880]  What about more people voting forever in the 2012 election and then Mitt Romney loses?
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:11.880]  I mean, Trump pointed out that Obama was way more unpopular by then than he was in 2008.
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:17.880]  The telling point was that they said there were 8 million people less that voted in 2000, not more less.
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:19.880]  And that was impossible.
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:21.880]  There was twice as much enthusiasm against Obama.
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:22.880]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:25.880]  Real numbers for political science I've talked to you said they believe it was more votes actually.
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:26.880]  That's right.
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.880]  And they said there were 8 million less.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:32.880]  That means that they had to kill so many votes electronically.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:33.880]  10 or 12 million.
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:35.880]  10 or 12 million in order to defeat Mitt Romney.
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:41.880]  And then Trump to his credit then did tweet and did get involved and did say, I believe this is fraud.
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:42.880]  And it was fraud.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:43.880]  Why are they so scared of him?
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:47.880]  Because despite the fact he's a bull in a Chinese shop, he really is a nationalist.
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:48.880]  He's not to get America.
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:53.880]  Well, that speech that you put out, you know, Donald Trump where he talks about how rigged the system in,
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.880]  the establishment and all of the things so well laid out, he cannot be allowed to be president.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:01.880]  Even though he doesn't have the best advisors surrounding him.
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:07.880]  I mean, just knowing what he's knowing about the establishment and promising to kill the establishment system.
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:09.880]  It just can't allow that to happen.
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:10.880]  I know what's happening with him.
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:11.880]  He's like me.
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.880]  When I get tired, I don't care.
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.880]  I'm on air and I just kind of start saying, you know, whatever I want to, even though they're going to take it out of context.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:19.880]  He's so real.
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:20.880]  That's his problem.
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:22.880]  They make him do so many speeches.
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:23.880]  He's happy to do it.
[02:12:23.880 --> 02:12:27.880]  The guy works like 18 hours a day that after he's doing his third speech for the day and is exhausted,
[02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.880]  he'll just start saying whatever he wants.
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:30.880]  And I think they work him too hard.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:31.880]  I think he should.
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:34.880]  Lately now they've got him more laser beamed.
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.880]  Well, he doesn't take time to am I off the microphone?
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:38.880]  No, no, you're on air.
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:39.880]  Okay.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:40.880]  He doesn't take time.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.880]  He's actually only kicked him out of America.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:42.880]  Yeah.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.880]  He doesn't take time to reflect upon what's going on.
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:46.880]  It doesn't take down time to memorize or any of that.
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:50.880]  He is a person who's very, very much hyped up and he has to go into that mode.
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.880]  And so, unfortunately, he's going to make mistakes.
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:57.880]  But you really think there's no way they're not going to steal it?
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:12:58.880]  That's right.
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:01.880]  There's no way I'm going to predict that it's going to be a landslide,
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:03.880]  manipulated landslide against Donald Trump.
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:05.880]  As a referendum on destroying America.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:06.880]  That's right.
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:11.880]  And to make sure that they have an excuse to come against the right wing media and say,
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:16.880]  this is what you caused, they're going to give the GOP establishment tremendous ammunition to say to,
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:20.880]  you know, we don't want to hear any more about these conspiracies.
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:22.880]  You've ruined us once, never again.
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:23.880]  That's right.
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:27.880]  And then try to train Republicans to sit down, be good while we dismantle the country,
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:29.880]  and maybe we'll give you a few seats in Congress.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:30.880]  Yeah.
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:31.880]  And it's not going to work.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.880]  I think the rebellion is permanent and it's going to be more and more intense.
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:41.880]  The trouble is, once Hillary Clinton gets in and legalizes so many illegal immigrants in a raw democracy,
[02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:42.880]  you cannot win another election.
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:43.880]  Well, that's right.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:46.880]  That's why you can see him scripting at all is what you're saying is not your opinion.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:47.880]  It's happening.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:48.880]  The question is, will they be successful?
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:49.880]  We're going to fight.
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:51.880]  They tried to steal it from him in the primary.
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:52.880]  He came out and exposed it.
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.880]  He's going to fight this time.
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:59.880]  The problem is he would have had Scalia the tiebreaker at a Supreme Court decision and would have won.
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:01.880]  Scalia is dead in the door now.
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:02.880]  That's right.
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:08.880]  And we're going to never win another Supreme Court opinion ever again once she stacks the Supreme Court against us.
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:11.880]  Did you notice even the Washington Post made a joke about a month later and said,
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:14.880]  yeah, he was in a secret society, ha, ha, ha, Bohemian Grove.
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:15.880]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:20.880]  I mean, he wasn't Bohemian Grove, but he was a subgroup of Bohemian Grove that he'd been lured into at that ranch.
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.880]  And they just basically told us.
[02:14:22.880 --> 02:14:23.880]  And there was a pillow on his face.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:25.880]  They wanted us to know.
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:27.880]  They might as well wrap body armor with fish, you know, and said,
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:29.880]  Luke O'Broxy sleeps with the fishes.
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:36.880]  Very suspicious when you don't have a coroner doing an autopsy on a major public figure like this.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.880]  It's been, you know, killed under a mysterious circumstance.
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:43.880]  And then Podesta's got emails out two days before with his lobbyist saying,
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:46.880]  got some wet work coming up, batten down the hatches.
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.880]  This is going to get rough.
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:51.880]  Yeah, wet work refers to assassinations by the dark side of government.
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:55.880]  Blood work.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:59.880]  Man, I see all these weirdo leftists that are really the targets of this that have no future.
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:04.880]  They've been given college degrees that are worthless and they're all just worshiping war and corporate lies.
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:09.880]  And a Nazi collaborator is their omnibudsman Soros.
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:11.880]  It's shameful.
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:15.880]  Well, it's a matter of just going along with a wave that they know nobody can stop.
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:16.880]  I mean, you're in government.
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:18.880]  You see, there's a control system.
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:21.880]  They don't know how it operates, but said, don't dare move against it.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:23.880]  I end up like Vince Foster.
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:30.880]  I mean, these kinds of killings that occur occasionally by the in the Clinton administration end up reverberating on down the line.
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:33.880]  It causes the fear of the establishment to be put in all the.
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:36.880]  But as you said, I'm going to get into Syria and some calls.
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:40.880]  Everything's a two way street and just organically.
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:42.880]  We've already seen some fireworks.
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:47.880]  I think I think I think if they steal it and they get in, I think it's the beginning of the end.
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:48.880]  I mean, it's almost better.
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:49.880]  They steal it.
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:52.880]  I think then Trump get in and they just sabotage him and blame us.
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.880]  That could be an even better bigger discredit.
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:57.880]  They're clearly trying to compromise Trump in case he does win.
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:15:59.880]  And that's why Newt Gingrich is there.
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:00.880]  That's why Chris Christie is there.
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:06.880]  That's why he doesn't have any of the Roger Stone advisors in the Trump camp anymore.
[02:16:06.880 --> 02:16:12.880]  Man, I tell you, well, a briefly putting bookends on the Syria situation right now.
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:14.880]  They're trying to let ISIS escape.
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:23.880]  The point I want to make on that is the whole purpose of creating ISIS and sending them into Iraq to build them as a military force was to eventually get back into Syria.
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:31.880]  And that's the reason why they're letting ISIS escape with their arms under every battle so that they can funnel them back into Syria.
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:40.880]  And then under the excuse of attacking ISIS, they'll be taking down Syrian troops just like they have twice already where U.S. bombers went in and attacked Syria positions.
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:46.880]  But they're going to bring all the ISIS forces in and eventually have an excuse to intervene and take down Syria.
[02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:49.880]  They won't be able to get through with a no fly zone because of Russia's intervention.
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:53.880]  But believe me, Syria is coming back into Syria.
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:17:01.880]  I mean, ISIS is coming into Syria in force in order to create an excuse for the U.S. to intervene directly, militarily.
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:05.880]  What do you make of Turkey starting to get closer to Russia?
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:13.880]  This is a very strange situation because one of the reasons why Turkey will stay in NATO, I think he's made his deal with the devil.
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:21.880]  He's going to be a plant within NATO and so Syria or Turkey is going to be funneling intelligence and information to Russia.
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:29.880]  And so Turkey's in a real difficult situation. They have to play both sides and play neutral.
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:40.880]  But they're clearly invading Syria. The U.S. is saying nothing about it, even though they shot down a Russian fighter who strayed, what, two miles or not even two miles, 200 feet into the Syrian border?
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:47.880]  Syria openly invades Syria. I mean, Turkey openly invades Syria and the U.S. says nothing about it. I mean, it's so hypocritical.
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:50.880]  The Russians aren't saying anything about it either and that's a problem.
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:57.880]  The Russians could be doing a lot more to exposing the globalist agenda towards exposing the hypocrisy.
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.880]  Well, obviously there's major globalist infiltration instilled inside the Russian apparatus.
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:11.880]  Although I think Putin and his oligarchs, remember he changed and purged the original oligarchs and created new ones that support him.
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:21.880]  But he's playing a cat and mouse game with the globalists. He's not ready to attack them directly and to inflame them directly and that's why he's playing kind of cool in these things.
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:26.880]  But he's not leaving Syria. So I think the U.S. is going to have trouble taking down Assad.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:32.880]  Remember the purpose of taking down Assad is then they invoke that nuclear agreement they made with Iran, which is full of traps.
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:37.880]  It isn't, as Trump thinks, a damaging thing for America.
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:44.880]  The actual American globalists did this agreement with Iran to set up a trap so they could have much use to attack them any time later on.
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:45.880]  Sure.
[02:18:45.880 --> 02:18:47.880]  That the Iranians are already violent.
[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:50.880]  Sure. Let's jam a real quick one in here because I've got to go right.
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:53.880]  Walter, you've got a question. Go ahead. You're calling from Virginia.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.880]  Mr. Jones, two questions for Dr. Skelton.
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:59.880]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:06.880]  I have your book. Is the Southern Korean Peninsula still doomed?
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:07.880]  You're not going to get the answer.
[02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:12.880]  Oh, I'm sorry. You got unplugged. That's what happened. I don't know. I guess you kicked something under there. I apologize.
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:15.880]  No wonder we can't take calls. We'll go to break and fix that.
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:20.880]  Okay, Joe, he was asking, is the South Korean Peninsula still a big trouble spot to live?
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:27.880]  It is. In fact, that's going to be the trouble spot. The trigger for World War III is an North Korean invasion of the South, which will invoke a nuclear war,
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:33.880]  because the U.S. will respond with tactical nukes. China will say, you started it and do that preemptive strike.
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:37.880]  So don't be in South Korea when this trigger happens.
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:40.880]  But then the double cross against Russia comes next?
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:50.880]  Double comes after the war started, Russia and China both together nuked the U.S. military. But then as the war is progressed and the U.S. regroups under a global military,
[02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.880]  then they'll talk China into...
[02:19:52.880 --> 02:19:58.880]  Sure, and it's because he classified in the 60s that there was a deal they tried to broker where the U.S. would join Russia in a strike on China,
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:11.880]  but they said, no, that deal never happened. We'll be back.
