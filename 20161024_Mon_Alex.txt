[00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:08.254]  We're only 14 days out from the election, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:09.314]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:11.255]  This is a big broadcast today.
[00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:11.775]  Stay with us.
[00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.816]  Joel Skousen in studio and more.
[00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:15.716]  But first, a John Bowne report.
[00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:29.461]  With President Barack Obama's last 100 days ticking down and the finish line in sight, both Trump and Clinton have described what each of their first 100 days as the next President of the United States will look like.
[00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:39.618]  I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for your families across our country.
[00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:49.085]  I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put DREAMers, including those with us today, at risk of deportation.
[00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:59.384]  And if Congress continues to refuse to act as president, I would do everything possible under the law to go even further.
[00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:03.927]  All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting.
[00:01:03.927 --> 00:01:05.808]  We will be very careful.
[00:01:05.808 --> 00:01:15.875]  Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my administration.
[00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:39.199]  We're trying to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification in combination with trade reforms, regulatory relief and lifting the restrictions on American energy.
[00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:50.144]  Middle class with family of two children will get basically approximately a 35% tax cut and that's what they can use and that money will go back into the economy.
[00:01:51.169 --> 00:02:00.715]  The current number of brackets will be reduced from seven to three, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified.
[00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:13.343]  Meanwhile, Hillary Henchman, Obama, Madeleine Albright, and Joe Biden continue to take cheap shots at Trump, whipping the Democratic base into an enraged mob capable of random acts of violence.
[00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:37.305]  It has just been learned on video that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt, you saw that blood pouring down their face, were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.
[00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:53.430]  I have never seen in my lifetime any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place.
[00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.254]  I have never seen anybody that is less equipped to talk about national security policy than Donald Trump.
[00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:03.096]  We have heard that half a million children have died.
[00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:04.617]  You know, is the price worth it?
[00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:11.190]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:26.974]  He said, because I'm famous, because I'm a star, because I'm a billionaire, I can do things other people can't.
[00:03:26.974 --> 00:03:31.415]  What a disgusting assertion for anyone to make.
[00:03:32.748 --> 00:03:36.249]  The press always asks me, don't I wish I were debating him?
[00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.789]  No, I wish during high school I could take him behind the gym.
[00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.069]  That's what I wish.
[00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:52.391]  While American voters can't escape the consolidating mainstream media that has unanimously declared Hillary the victor, regardless that polls show the popular vote could go either way.
[00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.211]  They know it.
[00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:54.872]  Everybody knows it.
[00:03:54.872 --> 00:04:01.653]  Over the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place.
[00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:18.002]  And one of those pollsters was the most accurate poll on the last two cycles.
[00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:24.331]  But the media refuses to even say it or put that word out.
[00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:25.693]  They refuse to talk about it.
[00:04:26.674 --> 00:04:33.040]  They're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:49.416]  As Hillary sets her campaign on cruise control and Trump continues to blaze down a path trying to relate to millions of undecided American voters that have to decide between a globalist endgame and a fuming populism that is breathing down the planet's neck.
[00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:51.218]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:04:57.238 --> 00:04:58.596]  We're good.
[00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:16.896]  Virginia Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend of the Clintons, gave a whopping $467,500 to the campaign of the wife of an FBI official who later helped supervise the probe of Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information.
[00:05:16.896 --> 00:05:27.720]  The investigation was conducted by the Wall Street Journal, and it says the governor's PAC donated to the state senate campaign of Jill McCain, who's married to Andrew McCabe, now the FBI's deputy director.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.501]  A spokesperson for the governor told the Wall Street Journal,
[00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:34.862]  McAuliffe, of course, supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good senator.
[00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:44.306]  Well, the FBI released a statement during McCabe's campaign saying that Mr. McCabe, her husband, quote, played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.
[00:05:44.306 --> 00:05:54.010]  Now, McAuliffe is also presently under investigation by the FBI's Washington field office regarding a probe that includes donations made on behalf of Chinese businessman Wang Wenliang.
[00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.591]  Well, as Trump pointed out, perhaps it's time to drain the swamp in Washington.
[00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.312]  I'm Margaret Halb reporting for InfoWars.
[00:06:01.553 --> 00:06:03.274]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[00:06:03.274 --> 00:06:07.578]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[00:06:07.578 --> 00:06:11.141]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:13.183]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:16.085]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:21.610]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALEX.
[00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.991]  It's a company I trust.
[00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:28.776]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:32.297]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:36.718]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:42.560]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.240]  Don't delay.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.262]  Call 844-541-ALEX now and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[00:06:50.262 --> 00:06:54.743]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[00:06:55.043 --> 00:06:57.685]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[00:06:57.685 --> 00:07:01.408]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX-NOW.
[00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:04.610]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.952]  Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com.

[00:07:57.865 --> 00:08:09.211]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:32.418]  In the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:32.418 --> 00:08:42.422]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're now only two weeks, or 14 days to be precise, from undoubtedly the most historic election in modern world history.
[00:08:43.934 --> 00:08:49.301]  And it's definitely up there, one of the most important elections in all of United States history, all 242 years.
[00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:50.643]  It is Monday, the 24th day of October 2016.
[00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:52.045]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:53.927]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:09:01.736 --> 00:09:10.841]  We have former Marine Corps officer and naval aviator Joel Skousen joining us in studio to talk about world affairs.
[00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:13.042]  He's the editor-in-chief of World Affairs Brief.
[00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:29.390]  That's in the second hour, but he's also here to tape a special report for us that'll be a month or two probably in the making dealing with real preparedness because you see all these bomb shelter redoubts being built in Hollywood and New York and places like that, New York City, Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas.
[00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.230]  They're a joke.
[00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.951]  They're a death trap.
[00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:40.080]  There's a larger issue, though, of why are the elite taking the money and running to New Zealand and other areas of the world?
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.702]  Or to the Caribbean and building armored fortresses?
[00:09:45.702 --> 00:09:49.782]  Because if you understand that, you understand the big picture, and you understand exactly what's coming.
[00:09:49.782 --> 00:09:53.103]  So all of that is coming up today.
[00:09:53.103 --> 00:09:58.984]  Bottom line, the world's social engineers believe that the planet's current course is unsustainable.
[00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:08.916]  So they have decided to grease the skids towards a controlled demolition of the world economy and culture.
[00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:12.538]  The controlled demolition of civilization.
[00:10:12.538 --> 00:10:17.480]  So we're not here predicting the fall.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.202]  We know they're engineering the fall, and we're trying to stop it.
[00:10:21.202 --> 00:10:24.584]  That's why everything we talk about basically ends up happening.
[00:10:24.584 --> 00:10:28.426]  Not because we predicted it, but because it's part of a global program.
[00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:31.274]  Self-driving cars.
[00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:40.778]  Told you they'd try to take all of our cars away, tax us by the mile, and force us into the self-driving cars 20 years ago, because that was coming out of MIT and the big think tanks.
[00:10:40.778 --> 00:10:43.260]  Now it's here.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.661]  We told you they'd dissolve the borders, because that's in the TPP.
[00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:48.222]  That's in the NAU.
[00:10:48.222 --> 00:10:54.946]  That's in the Trans-Pacific and Regional and Atlantic Partnership mergers.
[00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:59.068]  We're here chronicling the globalist plan, and they can't have their cake and eat it too.
[00:11:00.373 --> 00:11:07.317]  They can't deny there's a world government, deny there's a corporate plan, and all the rest of it, and then come out and promote a world government at the same time.
[00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:09.158]  But that's what they're doing.
[00:11:09.158 --> 00:11:15.401]  Just like they can't have Obamacare and claim it's free, or you can keep your doctor when it's not.
[00:11:15.401 --> 00:11:27.527]  So the chickens are coming home to roost, and people are really now being faced with the reality of what globalism truly stands for, and the fact that Hillary Clinton has gotten more corporate contributions than any other candidate in history.
[00:11:27.527 --> 00:11:28.848]  Basically, Trump's gotten zero.
[00:11:29.983 --> 00:11:32.911]  And the entire global corrupt power structure is against Trump.
[00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:34.455]  What does that tell you?
[00:11:34.455 --> 00:11:35.538]  It tells me a lot.
[00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:45.908]  And Jill Stein is back in the news, the head of the Green Party, a real liberal, saying, I want to congratulate, she actually excoriates, the Democrats for mastering the corporate realm.
[00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:50.812]  In fact, I'm looking at DrudgeReport.com with extremely powerful articles and information.
[00:11:50.812 --> 00:11:56.396]  Jill Stein excoriates Dems over mastery of corporate politics.
[00:11:56.396 --> 00:12:02.080]  And right above that, professor who predicted last five elections says Trump will win by 87%.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.482]  Now, he has an algorithm.
[00:12:04.482 --> 00:12:05.323]  He has a computer.
[00:12:06.323 --> 00:12:13.587]  When you go to the New York Times, they've got Hillary basically winning by a number even higher than that.
[00:12:13.587 --> 00:12:18.430]  And then they just said that it's some secret formula that they've got.
[00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.392]  They say Hillary Clinton has a 92% chance to win.
[00:12:22.392 --> 00:12:25.694]  Trump has an 8%.
[00:12:25.694 --> 00:12:29.516]  And CNN is going with the same headline that they're now looking past Trump.
[00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:32.018]  Okay, he's already lost two weeks out.
[00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:33.719]  They're totally rigging the election.
[00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:43.614]  And what's frustrating to me is, they're now up to what, Podesta leak number 16, and guess what's in the new one?
[00:12:43.614 --> 00:12:46.236]  It's right above it on drugsreport.com.
[00:12:46.236 --> 00:12:54.320]  Podesta email exposes dim playbook for rigging through oversamples, close quote.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:04.705]  Now, notice what I, last year or so, how I've been telling you Hillary was cheating Bernie Sanders and now Trump, with Bloomberg and Reuters and,
[00:13:05.945 --> 00:13:07.687]  CNN and all the rest of them, how are they doing?
[00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:18.076]  Because they tell you in the methodology under it, normally six, seven pages of methodology you have to go read, but we've done articles and shown screenshots here pretty much every day for the last year or so.
[00:13:18.076 --> 00:13:18.937]  How do they do it?
[00:13:18.937 --> 00:13:19.578]  Oversampling.
[00:13:20.922 --> 00:13:26.887]  Now, Zero Hedge reports, and of course it says this in the memo from Podesta running the mainstream media and the polls, basically.
[00:13:26.887 --> 00:13:31.731]  I mean, they give the orders to CNN, ABC, MSNBC, CBS.
[00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:33.132]  They get daily orders.
[00:13:33.132 --> 00:13:34.453]  Here's the talking point.
[00:13:34.453 --> 00:13:38.076]  That's why you tune in to CBS or NBC or ABC or CNN.
[00:13:38.076 --> 00:13:40.738]  It's all the same story in the same order.
[00:13:40.738 --> 00:13:49.144]  There's been thousands of those great super clip mashups showing the newscasters saying the same thing in the same order for all 30 minutes of the nightly news.
[00:13:49.144 --> 00:13:49.865]  This is what they do.
[00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:54.784]  But we have the email.
[00:13:54.784 --> 00:14:00.867]  And on average, they oversample 12 points.
[00:14:00.867 --> 00:14:04.429]  Now I've seen them where they sample 50-something points more.
[00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:09.251]  They have these Whoppers suckers where, oh look, she's gonna win by 76%!
[00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:14.493]  Oh boy, wow, we've got a new ABC News poll where 60-something percent are for Hillary.
[00:14:14.493 --> 00:14:17.095]  We only sampled 30-something percent more Democrats.
[00:14:17.095 --> 00:14:18.835]  I mean, whoa!
[00:14:18.835 --> 00:14:19.316]  Whoa!
[00:14:20.543 --> 00:14:24.266]  You talk about fraud land, there's always been some fraud.
[00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:27.849]  Generally, they would go in and say, oh, independents.
[00:14:27.849 --> 00:14:31.812]  They were sampling 20%, let's say, and then turns out 18% are really Democrats.
[00:14:31.812 --> 00:14:34.314]  They know that, but they're just saying that they're independents.
[00:14:34.314 --> 00:14:35.495]  And that's how they skew.
[00:14:35.495 --> 00:14:38.057]  They're not even doing that now.
[00:14:38.057 --> 00:14:43.742]  They're not even putting up the pretenses that this isn't total fraud, 2 plus 2 equals 7.
[00:14:43.742 --> 00:14:47.705]  I mean, this is that ridiculous.
[00:14:47.705 --> 00:14:48.246]  If you sample
[00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.290]  47% Democrats and 22% Republicans.
[00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.331]  This is one Reuters we've shown over and over again.
[00:14:55.331 --> 00:14:57.612]  And the rest is independents and they're mainly Democrats.
[00:14:57.612 --> 00:15:01.053]  Well of course Hillary's winning at 60-something percent.
[00:15:01.053 --> 00:15:05.574]  You do the math in those polls, she's actually 10-15 points behind.
[00:15:05.574 --> 00:15:07.375]  Which is what Trump's internal polling.
[00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:09.675]  He's got real pollsters.
[00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:10.816]  Real polling agencies.
[00:15:11.817 --> 00:15:12.437]  We're good to go.
[00:15:35.097 --> 00:15:36.758]  But just remove it from the equation.
[00:15:36.758 --> 00:15:44.845]  The whole power structure, foreign governments, the Pope, every other corrupt institution, the Communist Chinese are telling you, you can't have Donald Trump.
[00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:47.026]  You can't have Donald Trump.
[00:15:47.026 --> 00:15:48.247]  You can't have him.
[00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.088]  They've rigged everything.
[00:15:49.088 --> 00:15:58.295]  They've been caught, you know, turning his microphone off and turning it down and interrupting him 40-something times and 60-something times and her five or six times.
[00:15:58.295 --> 00:16:00.397]  It goes on and on.
[00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:02.098]  Total media warfare.
[00:16:03.988 --> 00:16:11.332]  Total disdain for the American people, and then meanwhile, New Podesta email exposes playbook for rigging polls through oversamples.
[00:16:11.332 --> 00:16:15.235]  As if we need WikiLeaks to know this.
[00:16:15.235 --> 00:16:18.977]  This is not the first one about them oversampling.
[00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:25.241]  As if we need WikiLeaks to tell us that the head of the DNC was sabotaging Bernie Sanders, or that the lady she replaced her with
[00:16:26.229 --> 00:16:28.231]  Donna Brazile was doing the same thing.
[00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:29.972]  I mean, we already know.
[00:16:29.972 --> 00:16:32.654]  That's the point, is it's completely transparent.
[00:16:32.654 --> 00:16:35.417]  So if they stole it from Bernie Sanders, will they steal it from Trump?
[00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:36.398]  Absolutely.
[00:16:36.398 --> 00:16:38.860]  Are they federalizing it to, quote, keep Trump from stealing it?
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:45.145]  Yes, but election fraud doesn't exist, but it does exist by Trump.
[00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:48.628]  So we've got to put together short informational videos that just show the sampling.
[00:16:49.935 --> 00:16:54.478]  And just say, dear Democrats, Trump really is ahead 10 points conservatively.
[00:16:54.478 --> 00:16:56.519]  And that's why they're in full-scale panic.
[00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:01.222]  You think that the owner of Amazon just went in even more money against Trump?
[00:17:01.222 --> 00:17:04.645]  You think the owner of Facebook went in even more against Trump?
[00:17:04.645 --> 00:17:06.666]  You think Google admits they're all in against Trump?
[00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:12.172]  Spending billions, basically, in off-the-books money and advertising on the web.
[00:17:12.172 --> 00:17:24.808]  I mean, we've never seen such a concerted, worldwide effort because he's a nationalist, they know he's a nationalist, and their sweetheart deals of totally controlling Congress are at least going to be in question if he gets in.
[00:17:25.868 --> 00:17:36.662]  And by the way, there's no doubt with the New York Times calling for his death, there's no doubt with all the violence we've heard in the media, that they plan to kill him if he does get in.
[00:17:36.662 --> 00:17:42.270]  So don't think if Trump gets in, we've got peaches and cream out in front of us.
[00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.812]  The fight has just begun, but here it is.
[00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:54.574]  Like many of the recent polls from Reuters, ABC, and the Washington Post, the latest poll included a 9-point sampling bias towards registered Democrats, which is a low bias normally.
[00:17:54.574 --> 00:17:56.895]  A poll thrown out of it has any bias.
[00:17:56.895 --> 00:18:03.717]  Earlier this morning, we wrote about the obvious sampling bias in the latest ABC-Washington Post poll that showed a 12-point national average.
[00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:06.418]  By the way, that's the average of what they oversampled.
[00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.518]  It happened to be 12.
[00:18:07.518 --> 00:18:13.400]  Like many of the recent polls, Reuters, ABC, and the Washington Post's latest poll included a 9-point sampling bias towards registered Democrats.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.960]  They admit that.
[00:18:15.143 --> 00:18:17.444]  CNN's even worse than their phone system.
[00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:19.584]  They admit more than double Democrats they sample.
[00:18:19.584 --> 00:18:20.944]  I mean, that is cuckoo.
[00:18:20.944 --> 00:18:26.806]  By the way, we're about to go to break, but I want to play this clip first, and then come back with Trump talking about this, and then they demonize him.
[00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:29.026]  This is just last week.
[00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:29.947]  This got no attention.
[00:18:29.947 --> 00:18:35.008]  In fact, there's two of these clips where you've got focus groups.
[00:18:35.008 --> 00:18:37.248]  Ten of them are for Trump.
[00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:39.089]  Five are for Hillary.
[00:18:39.089 --> 00:18:43.730]  And then you've got six that are undecided, and you can bet your bottom dollar they're just embarrassing or really for Trump.
[00:18:44.841 --> 00:18:46.542]  But let's just say it's 10 to 5.
[00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.144]  That's double.
[00:18:48.144 --> 00:18:49.324]  That's double.
[00:18:49.324 --> 00:18:50.625]  I know Democrats all over Austin.
[00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.987]  They say they don't know anyone voting for Hillary.
[00:18:52.987 --> 00:18:54.789]  I saw one Hillary sticker this morning.
[00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:59.352]  I was looking all weekend in jam-packed traffic for Formula One here.
[00:18:59.352 --> 00:19:00.733]  It's like a game with my kids.
[00:19:00.733 --> 00:19:01.994]  Where's a Hillary sticker?
[00:19:01.994 --> 00:19:02.975]  I saw one.
[00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.257]  There are Bernie Sanders stickers everywhere.
[00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.111]  Signs are still up everywhere.
[00:19:09.111 --> 00:19:11.894]  You can't go a half mile without seeing one.
[00:19:11.894 --> 00:19:12.874]  No Hillary!
[00:19:12.874 --> 00:19:16.397]  Unless you go to the most elite rich area, then there's some signs up.
[00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:19.159]  It is a hoax.
[00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:19.740]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.062]  I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna first play CNN.
[00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:25.624]  And boy, they cut the feed just like they cut the satellite.
[00:19:25.624 --> 00:19:30.028]  As soon as they go and it's double the Trump supporters, they shut it down.
[00:19:30.028 --> 00:19:31.289]  And that's what's happening.
[00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:32.290]  We can't find
[00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:36.789]  Hillary supporters back during the primaries on the streets anywhere in the U.S.
[00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:40.770]  We cannot even find them.
[00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.671]  So, something's going on here.
[00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:57.956]  And we know they are massively oversampling Hillary supporters or Democrats, these imaginary people, to say that Trump is losing to create the perception so when they do steal it, there's plausible buyability, basically.
[00:19:57.956 --> 00:19:58.416]  We'll be back.
[00:19:58.416 --> 00:19:58.756]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.886 --> 00:20:06.689]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:20:06.689 --> 00:20:12.552]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:20:12.552 --> 00:20:19.076]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:20:19.076 --> 00:20:23.118]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[00:20:23.118 --> 00:20:29.362]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to MinutemanStove.com.
[00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:31.143]  That's MinutemanStove.com.
[00:20:31.443 --> 00:20:34.424]  Charlie Daniels, he's always defended the 2nd Amendment.
[00:20:34.424 --> 00:20:37.025]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[00:20:37.025 --> 00:20:38.206]  Individual rights.
[00:20:38.206 --> 00:20:40.207]  We'll have to take a back seat to the collected.
[00:20:40.207 --> 00:20:42.568]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[00:20:42.568 --> 00:20:43.768]  It's gonna be coming after your gun.
[00:20:43.768 --> 00:20:47.309]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.
[00:20:47.309 --> 00:20:49.490]  And beef was for supper.
[00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.231]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[00:20:52.231 --> 00:20:53.872]  The ethical screening's on demand.
[00:20:53.872 --> 00:20:55.273]  DVD's now available.
[00:20:55.273 --> 00:20:58.734]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[00:20:58.734 --> 00:21:00.795]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:02.295]  Think about this.
[00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:14.878]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:21:14.878 --> 00:21:19.159]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:22.980]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:29.262]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA,
[00:21:29.522 --> 00:21:32.023]  Pesticides, bacteria and viruses.
[00:21:32.023 --> 00:21:34.044]  All forms of fluoride and much more.
[00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:37.566]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[00:21:37.566 --> 00:21:39.787]  The gold standard in water purification.

[00:22:02.138 --> 00:22:02.979]  Rampant hacking.
[00:22:02.979 --> 00:22:03.799]  Identity theft.
[00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:04.659]  Mass surveillance.
[00:22:04.659 --> 00:22:06.680]  Defending yourself today is not an option.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.621]  It's a requirement.

[00:23:57.275 --> 00:23:57.515]  800-328-1860.
[00:23:57.515 --> 00:24:16.065]  If we remove Donald Trump out of the equation and just look at the state of the corporate media in this country and their constituents,
[00:24:19.597 --> 00:24:21.497]  It is an exercise in criminality.
[00:24:21.497 --> 00:24:24.918]  It's an exercise in lockstep disinformation.
[00:24:24.918 --> 00:24:32.660]  It's an exercise in the takeover of this country.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:41.262]  And the people going along with it are the folks that are going to end up basically losing their prosperity, losing their freedom in the process.
[00:24:41.262 --> 00:24:45.063]  So it is a fool's game.
[00:24:45.063 --> 00:24:47.043]  An absolute fool's errand.
[00:24:47.043 --> 00:24:48.924]  This whole corrupt system must be overturned.
[00:24:50.179 --> 00:24:55.620]  The problem is they're trying to overturn one corrupt system with even more draconian control.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:01.542]  Because at the bottom of all this is an immorality of corruption.
[00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:04.642]  This nation, this world, has cancer.
[00:25:04.642 --> 00:25:15.885]  And so it's so incredible to have all these WikiLeaks emails and have a new one with Podesta, the head of the campaign for Hillary, telling Democrats how to rig the polls
[00:25:17.438 --> 00:25:20.021]  And directing that they were doing it through over-sampling.
[00:25:20.021 --> 00:25:21.784]  So they go out and they do these polls.
[00:25:21.784 --> 00:25:23.907]  The Democrats pay for the polls.
[00:25:23.907 --> 00:25:28.232]  But in many cases, the big media outlets are run by Democratic Party operatives and top donors.
[00:25:28.232 --> 00:25:30.335]  The top 20 companies are on record.
[00:25:30.335 --> 00:25:31.096]  Lockstep against...
[00:25:32.441 --> 00:25:35.083]  Trump and the populist movement.
[00:25:35.083 --> 00:25:41.007]  And then they have them oversample massively to put Hillary way ahead in some polls.
[00:25:41.007 --> 00:25:47.731]  They'll only oversample 9, 10, 11, 12 points to have her in a dead heat with him because that's really how far ahead Trump is.
[00:25:47.731 --> 00:25:55.817]  Again, 10 to 15 points is about as accurate as we can get.
[00:25:55.817 --> 00:25:57.758]  So here's CNN and the focus group.
[00:25:58.729 --> 00:26:05.734]  The people they brought in and basically instructed how to vote, even though they've been caught on tape instructing him to go for Hillary, it backfires every week.
[00:26:05.734 --> 00:26:06.675]  This happens every week.
[00:26:06.675 --> 00:26:07.615]  Here it is.
[00:26:07.615 --> 00:26:09.937]  Let's ask the group with a show of hands.
[00:26:09.937 --> 00:26:13.159]  Did this debate help any of you decide on a candidate?
[00:26:13.159 --> 00:26:18.883]  And if so, how many of you have decided now to vote for Hillary Clinton?
[00:26:18.883 --> 00:26:20.564]  One, two, three, five of you.
[00:26:20.564 --> 00:26:23.807]  Okay, how about did this debate help you decide to vote for Donald Trump?
[00:26:26.206 --> 00:26:30.769]  So, that's 5 for Hillary, 6 undecided, they didn't want Gary Johnson or Jill Stein, and 10 for Trump.
[00:26:52.534 --> 00:26:53.975]  But you're not going to see that anywhere.
[00:26:53.975 --> 00:27:00.602]  That's what, though, keeps coming out when they do focus groups that they don't fully control, after they actually hear Donald Trump speak.
[00:27:00.602 --> 00:27:07.648]  Now, that's why we have CNN executives saying, we made a big mistake ever letting any of him get on CNN.
[00:27:07.648 --> 00:27:09.610]  Stop carrying any of his speeches.
[00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.513]  First, they carry big chunks because he got top ratings, because he's popular.
[00:27:12.513 --> 00:27:13.734]  Then they carry small chunks.
[00:27:13.734 --> 00:27:16.216]  Now, they just carry stuff out of context.
[00:27:17.162 --> 00:27:18.583]  Here's the next clip.
[00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:22.867]  This is, again, CNN saying they're already looking ahead.
[00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:28.413]  So they show a clip of Trump saying that he's gaining in polls or that he's even with her two points ahead.
[00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:34.018]  And that's him going off some of the more less unfair, they're still unfair, polls.
[00:27:34.018 --> 00:27:34.679]  He's way ahead.
[00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:40.644]  Then they cut to, oh, but we're already looking ahead past Trump at what Hillary's going to do.
[00:27:40.644 --> 00:27:40.965]  Here it is.
[00:27:42.145 --> 00:27:46.767]  That we are leading nationally by two points.
[00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:49.388]  Numbers are looking phenomenal in Florida.
[00:27:49.388 --> 00:27:50.689]  Don't believe the media.
[00:27:50.689 --> 00:27:55.591]  But a new ABC News national poll shows Trump trailing Clinton by 12 points.
[00:27:55.591 --> 00:28:02.574]  Meantime, CNN has learned Clinton is increasingly moving beyond Trump and turning her attention to her transition to the presidency.
[00:28:02.574 --> 00:28:07.476]  A Democrat close to Clinton saying, she's not being arrogant, she's being diligent.
[00:28:07.476 --> 00:28:08.797]  Clinton is sizing up candidates.
[00:28:11.986 --> 00:28:16.848]  No guys, I was just saying I wanted you while that was on screen to show people this article.
[00:28:16.848 --> 00:28:19.268]  So we can finish the clip and I want to just show TV viewers.
[00:28:19.268 --> 00:28:20.789]  That's the end of the clip.
[00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:22.650]  I thought it was, the center of my sheet was longer than that.
[00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:23.970]  Okay, well, let's play the clip again.
[00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.430]  I think it's very, very informative.
[00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:26.471]  Let's just play that clip again.
[00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:26.691]  Here it is.
[00:28:27.759 --> 00:28:32.401]  That we are leading nationally by two points.
[00:28:32.401 --> 00:28:35.021]  Numbers are looking phenomenal in Florida.
[00:28:35.021 --> 00:28:36.322]  Don't believe the media.
[00:28:36.322 --> 00:28:41.204]  But a new ABC News national poll shows Trump trailing Clinton by 12 points.
[00:28:41.204 --> 00:28:47.726]  Meantime, CNN has learned Clinton is increasingly moving beyond Trump and turning her attention to her transition to the presidency.
[00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:53.108]  A Democrat close to Clinton saying, she's not being arrogant, she's being diligent.
[00:28:53.108 --> 00:28:54.428]  Clinton is sizing up candidates.
[00:28:58.146 --> 00:29:12.133]  Remember, the very poll they're just showing on screen has a, we just showed you earlier, here it is, from Zero Hedge, a 12% oversampling rate of Democrats, and what was Hillary ahead?
[00:29:12.133 --> 00:29:14.935]  12 points.
[00:29:14.935 --> 00:29:17.396]  I mean, right there, that's saying dead heat.
[00:29:17.396 --> 00:29:26.901]  The article's up on Infowars.com, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, it's up on DrugsReport.com, along with the next clip we've got,
[00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:37.192]  When we come back, and that's the professor who predicted last five elections, says Trump has 87% chance of winning.
[00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:42.673]  And Google, its own Googlebot, a few months ago admitted that Trump is set to win.
[00:29:42.673 --> 00:29:47.334]  I mean, even in places like the District of Columbia, Hillary barely has a lead.
[00:29:47.334 --> 00:29:49.435]  She's supposed to win District of Columbia by 25 points, not anymore.
[00:29:51.107 --> 00:29:55.040]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.748]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.543 --> 00:30:09.329]  In a private 2012 board meeting, George Soros said that the rise of money in politics poses a great threat to democracy.
[00:30:09.329 --> 00:30:14.013]  Ironically, his primary role in politics has been a benefactor to corrupt politicos.
[00:30:14.013 --> 00:30:18.617]  This is coming from a hacked internal document from Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:20.819]  It was published by DC Leaks this summer.
[00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:22.400]  Now, including in the DC Leaks Dom,
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.542]  Were the meetings of this meeting from the OSF board.
[00:30:25.542 --> 00:30:33.969]  The meeting was attended by OSF staff along with Soros and during the meeting they were tackling challenges like how best to create a quote racial narrative.
[00:30:33.969 --> 00:30:39.674]  According to the minute Soros told attendees he believes the rise of money in politics endangers our democracy.
[00:30:39.674 --> 00:30:49.382]  Ironically that didn't stop Soros from giving 10 million to a pro-Clinton super PAC or stop him from secretly paying the salaries of four staffers of the Moldovan Prime Minister's office.
[00:30:49.562 --> 00:30:53.792]  Guess when Hillary mentioned all the dark money and getting it out of politics in the last debate?
[00:30:53.792 --> 00:30:56.739]  She didn't mean people like her BFF George Soros.
[00:30:56.739 --> 00:30:59.224]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:01.636 --> 00:31:02.476]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:02.476 --> 00:31:04.757]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:31:04.757 --> 00:31:08.599]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:10.680]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:20.964]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:20.964 --> 00:31:26.947]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:27.407 --> 00:31:42.295]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:31:42.375 --> 00:31:42.816]  I think.
[00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:10.870]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid.
[00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.753]  The potential for power grid chaos.
[00:32:13.753 --> 00:32:21.940]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.863]  My friends, chaos is already here, and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[00:32:25.123 --> 00:32:31.187]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[00:32:31.187 --> 00:32:35.089]  Now, I've got the perfect power solar generator system at my house.
[00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:36.970]  The Solutions from Science system.
[00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.491]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[00:32:39.491 --> 00:32:41.973]  Solutions from Science only makes the best equipment.
[00:32:41.973 --> 00:32:44.734]  Go to powergridchaos.com.
[00:32:44.734 --> 00:32:47.776]  That's powergridchaos.com to check it out.
[00:32:47.776 --> 00:32:48.857]  Now, this is key.

[00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.051]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:22.051 --> 00:33:23.692]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:23.692 --> 00:33:32.917]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.917 --> 00:33:43.983]  There was an amateur video that popped up the last few days on YouTube that I thought was extremely powerful that we aired yesterday that is starting to go viral.
[00:33:43.983 --> 00:33:49.006]  And we've tweeted it at RealAlexJones with the headline, this video could win the election for Trump.
[00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:51.149]  It's extremely powerful.
[00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:57.210]  It's things that Trump has said that you never see on the news that they basically blockade.
[00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:01.231]  I'm going to air that report coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[00:34:01.231 --> 00:34:04.952]  And we have Joel Skousen in studio with us, always informative.
[00:34:04.952 --> 00:34:07.172]  But the video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:34:07.172 --> 00:34:09.752]  Please retweet the video.
[00:34:09.752 --> 00:34:16.854]  This video could win the election for Trump or find it on my Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:18.254]  And tweet it at Donald Trump.
[00:34:18.254 --> 00:34:19.294]  He needs to tweet this out.
[00:34:21.411 --> 00:34:30.655]  You can tweet whatever he wants to say about it, like, you know, powerful compilation of my words, or this is what the media doesn't want you to see, Donald Trump.
[00:34:30.655 --> 00:34:33.036]  Because it's powerful.
[00:34:33.036 --> 00:34:36.558]  It deserves to get 30 million views.
[00:34:36.558 --> 00:34:37.458]  I'll be frank with you.
[00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:44.862]  We do some videos around here and they're all important, but when something gets 20 million views, which happens routinely, or 10 million views, or 30 million views,
[00:34:46.863 --> 00:34:49.124]  And it's not our most hardcore information.
[00:34:49.124 --> 00:34:55.107]  I get upset because I'll spend a week on something and it gets a million views, which is not negligible.
[00:34:55.107 --> 00:34:56.948]  It's not chopped liver.
[00:34:56.948 --> 00:35:00.730]  And man, if it got 20 million, 30 million views, it could change the world.
[00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.051]  But here's the good news.
[00:35:02.051 --> 00:35:06.793]  We're putting so much hardcore info out that it's all having a huge effect.
[00:35:06.793 --> 00:35:08.254]  You are having a huge effect.
[00:35:08.254 --> 00:35:11.615]  The enemy is not going to tell you that.
[00:35:11.615 --> 00:35:13.356]  Andrea Mitchell.
[00:35:13.356 --> 00:35:14.697]  Talk about a consummate insider.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:19.878]  Last time I checked, I think she's married to Alan Greenspan.
[00:35:19.878 --> 00:35:22.179]  Talk about an insider.
[00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:28.682]  He was on the plane last week with Hillary, and her press secretary is handing a phone with questions.
[00:35:28.682 --> 00:35:33.384]  Mitchell nods and then asks the question about Trump bullying women.
[00:35:33.384 --> 00:35:37.606]  I mean, they sit there and rig the questions in front of you.
[00:35:37.606 --> 00:35:40.767]  They oversample the polls to say Hillary's ahead.
[00:35:40.767 --> 00:35:44.069]  This is outrageous.
[00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.589]  Outrageous.
[00:35:46.988 --> 00:35:55.694]  But the good news is, if Trump didn't run, if we didn't build the Tea Party movement, if you didn't take action, we'd be in worse shape now.
[00:35:55.694 --> 00:35:59.396]  At least now, they've got to debate the New World Order, global government.
[00:35:59.396 --> 00:36:03.039]  They've got to debate Obamacare being a giant screwjob.
[00:36:03.039 --> 00:36:06.901]  They've got to face the record, and time is on our side.
[00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:08.422]  Time is not on their side.
[00:36:08.422 --> 00:36:10.544]  That's why they're moving to censor the internet.
[00:36:10.544 --> 00:36:13.946]  It's why they're moving towards authoritarianism, and we're fighting them every step of the way.
[00:36:15.922 --> 00:36:17.543]  And more and more, they're losing ground.
[00:36:17.543 --> 00:36:20.825]  Yes, they're able to engage in comp-troller fraud.
[00:36:20.825 --> 00:36:24.248]  They're able to engage in executive fraud, because they're at the top.
[00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:28.851]  They're able to wave wands and make Hillary above the law, but not above the court of public opinion.
[00:36:28.851 --> 00:36:32.793]  And now, a new email from Podesta.
[00:36:32.793 --> 00:36:42.419]  The head of her campaign is out, talking to media and talking to staff about how to quote, over-sample so Hillary looks like she's invincible.
[00:36:42.419 --> 00:36:44.401]  The story is on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:45.731 --> 00:36:46.892]  It's a zero-hedge article.
[00:36:46.892 --> 00:36:49.214]  It's red-linked on drivesreport.com.
[00:36:49.214 --> 00:36:53.077]  I don't care where you get it, get it and send it out to people.
[00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.958]  And we've done a whole bunch of videos on this.
[00:36:54.958 --> 00:37:02.163]  I mean, probably, I don't want to exaggerate, 20 reports the last year about how Reuters rigs polls.
[00:37:02.163 --> 00:37:06.307]  Just search, Reuters caught rigging poll, Infowars.com.
[00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:07.648]  Let's search it right now for TV viewers.
[00:37:08.496 --> 00:37:11.557]  And you'll see a bunch of videos showing them doing it.
[00:37:11.557 --> 00:37:13.578]  25 points, 15 points oversampled.
[00:37:13.578 --> 00:37:15.319]  Bloomberg caught doing it.
[00:37:15.319 --> 00:37:16.660]  ABC caught doing it.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.702]  The ABC poll they quoted earlier oversampled Democrats 12%.
[00:37:21.702 --> 00:37:22.783]  What did Hillary win by?
[00:37:22.783 --> 00:37:25.244]  12%.
[00:37:25.244 --> 00:37:27.705]  You're like, wait a minute, I thought you said he's really ahead of her.
[00:37:27.705 --> 00:37:31.447]  That's a Florida poll and where they hide the numbers is the independent sampling.
[00:37:32.722 --> 00:37:37.186]  But I just guess they know they can't say independence 40% and then oversample out of that.
[00:37:37.186 --> 00:37:38.867]  They've got to say we oversampled Democrats.
[00:37:38.867 --> 00:37:40.128]  I don't know why they're being honest.
[00:37:40.128 --> 00:37:41.830]  You're going to lie in the poll.
[00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.131]  Why put up the methodology?
[00:37:43.131 --> 00:37:46.374]  Because I think somehow by them telling us, they think it makes it okay.
[00:37:46.374 --> 00:37:48.796]  Like, we're not hiding we did that.
[00:37:48.796 --> 00:37:49.856]  We're the pollsters.
[00:37:49.856 --> 00:37:50.957]  We're the scientists.
[00:37:50.957 --> 00:37:53.540]  So it doesn't matter.
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:38:00.886]  Hey, when you can meet, I also want to get your Atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in February.
[00:38:02.264 --> 00:38:03.606]  By market readers, etc.
[00:38:03.606 --> 00:38:10.276]  I want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling.
[00:38:10.276 --> 00:38:12.740]  Boom!
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.545]  This is Podesta in emails with his minions.
[00:38:16.653 --> 00:38:19.277]  I mean, I don't need WikiLeaks.
[00:38:19.277 --> 00:38:20.639]  I can read it.
[00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:21.680]  It's a fraud.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.503]  And then you talk to friends on the street.
[00:38:23.503 --> 00:38:25.206]  They don't support Hillary.
[00:38:25.206 --> 00:38:28.811]  None of them have stickers on their cars, but they will go, oh, you're just mad.
[00:38:28.811 --> 00:38:30.673]  You like that racist Trump.
[00:38:30.673 --> 00:38:32.857]  And I'm like, listen, this is not about Trump anymore.
[00:38:34.244 --> 00:38:41.608]  This is about the integrity of this country and the fact that the evil is being flaunted in our face.
[00:38:41.608 --> 00:38:56.896]  All the big corporations, all the big evil countries like China and Saudi Arabia, every corrupt organization, Hollywood, the big banks, Goldman Sachs, the weapons manufacturers, the big drug companies are just flooding her with money, propping her up.
[00:39:01.104 --> 00:39:02.785]  The analogy would be like the movie Tron.
[00:39:02.785 --> 00:39:06.409]  I saw that on TV last week and watched like 10 minutes of it.
[00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:13.094]  And you've got, you know, the evil program that actually runs the whole show, but it's got a human that jacks into the Matrix.
[00:39:13.094 --> 00:39:16.417]  He's like his top minion.
[00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:21.081]  Or a avatar of the human that's in the real world that heads up the software company.
[00:39:21.081 --> 00:39:24.825]  And he's actually fighting a human that's been put into the Matrix-like system.
[00:39:26.889 --> 00:39:34.834]  And the big central computer starts to lose, because it's program is all based on game programs, and he says, all my systems are yours.
[00:39:34.834 --> 00:39:41.279]  I forget the bad guy character's name, he like, grows up to 500 feet tall.
[00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:43.560]  And that's basically what they've done to Hillary.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:53.047]  They have just, just, all our systems are yours, all the money, all the power, all the propaganda, every dirty trick, everything, everything is yours, oh!
[00:39:53.047 --> 00:39:54.888]  And then they say in the Financial Times of London,
[00:39:58.004 --> 00:40:07.126]  In the Economist, in the New York Times, in every globalist publication, from the Atlantic Monthly to you name it, we're in red alert.
[00:40:07.126 --> 00:40:08.407]  Hillary's in trouble.
[00:40:08.407 --> 00:40:09.927]  We've got to put everything behind her.
[00:40:09.927 --> 00:40:16.509]  If she falls, we fall because of the domino of Brexit and the domino of the Russians pulling out of the globalist system.
[00:40:16.509 --> 00:40:17.389]  Red alert.
[00:40:17.389 --> 00:40:19.710]  Every country in the euro is trying to pull out.
[00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:24.011]  They've got General Milley, the head of the army, threatening countries and they try to pull out of the euro.
[00:40:24.983 --> 00:40:27.003]  Well, it hits you harder than it's ever been hit before.
[00:40:27.003 --> 00:40:31.224]  That's because this whole stinking system is in trouble.
[00:40:31.224 --> 00:40:33.345]  And it wasn't supposed to go down this early.
[00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:35.845]  It was supposed to collapse after some big world war.
[00:40:35.845 --> 00:40:37.666]  And then they bring in the super world government.
[00:40:37.666 --> 00:40:40.306]  But the whole thing is falling apart.
[00:40:40.306 --> 00:40:44.187]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:40:44.187 --> 00:40:45.967]  A tale of two cities.
[00:40:45.967 --> 00:40:47.828]  A tale of two cities?
[00:40:47.828 --> 00:40:52.229]  Well, that's best of times, worst of times.
[00:40:52.229 --> 00:40:52.369]  So.
[00:40:53.402 --> 00:41:03.564]  This election is lovely and dark and deep, but I've got light years to go before I sleep.
[00:41:03.564 --> 00:41:17.327]  Whatever happens in 14 days, you better believe this whole process has been rigged, the media has been rigged, the polls have been rigged, and if it convinces the public that Trump's really a loser and people stay home and then he loses, it was rigged.
[00:41:17.327 --> 00:41:21.148]  But it was mind control, so technically it wasn't.
[00:41:21.148 --> 00:41:22.228]  We forfeited
[00:41:23.649 --> 00:41:25.130]  Because we were weak-minded.
[00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:28.512]  But I don't think that's going to happen, folks.
[00:41:28.512 --> 00:41:34.815]  And that's why they've got the Democrats out voting 10 times, and that's why they're getting caught and don't care, and you see the criminal arrogance.
[00:41:34.815 --> 00:41:36.196]  It is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:41:36.196 --> 00:41:37.917]  I want to play some more of these clips, but first off...
[00:41:39.312 --> 00:41:48.175]  We are running a special on our flagship nootropic product that just takes natural compounds that are known to healthily boost brain activity.
[00:41:48.175 --> 00:41:50.716]  It's so strong, quite frankly, I don't even ever really need it.
[00:41:50.716 --> 00:41:54.077]  I probably should take one today because I exercise so hard today.
[00:41:54.077 --> 00:41:57.118]  I'm pretty exhausted, but I haven't taken one yet.
[00:41:57.118 --> 00:41:58.158]  That'll be about four o'clock today.
[00:41:58.158 --> 00:41:59.279]  I have to keep going.
[00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:01.760]  But it's got a bunch of amazing nootropics in it.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.760]  It supports the broadcast.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.886]  Leading competitors are $50-$60 for things that are similar and aren't even as organic.
[00:42:07.886 --> 00:42:11.090]  It's $22 right now with 25% off.
[00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.952]  Mega special on Brain Force!
[00:42:14.178 --> 00:42:15.919]  Read the hundreds of five-star reviews.
[00:42:15.919 --> 00:42:16.979]  Brain Force.
[00:42:16.979 --> 00:42:19.481]  Secure your brain force and support the InfoWar.
[00:42:19.481 --> 00:42:26.944]  InfoWarStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the subsection where you'll find our supplements.
[00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:31.327]  Kathy in Pittsburgh, PA said, five stars, I'll be refilling.
[00:42:31.327 --> 00:42:33.628]  I was amazed at how well this product made me feel.
[00:42:33.628 --> 00:42:34.548]  I did not expect to be 100%.
[00:42:37.045 --> 00:42:39.547]  What it was taken up to be, but definitely is.
[00:42:39.547 --> 00:42:43.571]  I've cut out my five hour energy daily with this supplement.
[00:42:43.571 --> 00:42:44.091]  Thanks.
[00:42:44.091 --> 00:42:45.453]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:45.453 --> 00:42:45.753]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:47.082 --> 00:42:52.203]  I mean, I haven't even had coffee today, folks, because I've gotten so weaned off of things just taking brain force.
[00:42:52.203 --> 00:42:54.024]  Now I've gotten to the point where I don't even need brain force.
[00:42:54.024 --> 00:42:55.844]  I take selenium.
[00:42:55.844 --> 00:42:59.985]  I'll just be honest, our bio-true selenium gives me even better, cleaner energy than this.
[00:42:59.985 --> 00:43:01.606]  But it varies people to people.
[00:43:01.606 --> 00:43:05.107]  Some folks take the selenium and say that they don't really feel it, maybe you weren't deficient in it.
[00:43:05.107 --> 00:43:10.768]  But bio-true selenium is the strongest, most powerful organic stuff you're going to find anywhere at a price that is a joke.
[00:43:10.768 --> 00:43:11.889]  It's so inexpensive.
[00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:12.729]  From the mustard seed.
[00:43:14.284 --> 00:43:15.365]  So BioTrue Selenium.
[00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:19.067]  In fact, let me know in the reviews which one you like better.
[00:43:19.067 --> 00:43:20.047]  I need to take my BioTrue.
[00:43:20.047 --> 00:43:21.448]  I haven't taken any since Friday.
[00:43:21.448 --> 00:43:22.508]  That's one reason I'm probably low.
[00:43:22.508 --> 00:43:23.429]  I'm not even low on energy.
[00:43:23.429 --> 00:43:25.030]  I'm just so relaxed today.
[00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.631]  I was like driving and almost falling asleep.
[00:43:27.631 --> 00:43:30.293]  I don't know what's going on, but I feel good now that I'm on air.
[00:43:30.293 --> 00:43:34.655]  I don't ever want to be without this product, said Davish in Vancouver, Washington.
[00:43:34.655 --> 00:43:37.336]  I see a major difference in my mental clarity when I take this product.
[00:43:37.336 --> 00:43:38.577]  I don't ever want to be without it.
[00:43:40.776 --> 00:43:49.002]  So that's just two of the hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:51.424]  And Living Defense is also back in stock.
[00:43:51.424 --> 00:43:53.225]  It's sold out for months at a time.
[00:43:53.225 --> 00:44:00.950]  One of our best sellers, even though it's sold out most of the time because it's got so many ingredients, it's hard to get them all and have them all be organic-level California standards.
[00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:05.393]  It's made to be impossible so the lawyers can sue everybody, but we do pass the California standards.
[00:44:06.522 --> 00:44:08.605]  Every once in a while, you just cannot get an ingredient.
[00:44:08.605 --> 00:44:09.546]  It's a California standard.
[00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:15.294]  We'll put on the website then, this batch does not pass California standards, say, with this, you know, ingredient.
[00:44:15.294 --> 00:44:16.095]  Sorry!
[00:44:16.095 --> 00:44:19.099]  So, now you can't have it in California, but that happens rarely.
[00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:20.801]  But that's why we sell a lot of stuff so often.
[00:44:20.801 --> 00:44:23.484]  That's not some, you know, artificial scarcity gimmick.
[00:44:24.285 --> 00:44:27.166]  Believe me, we're sold out of this more than we have in stock.
[00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:29.427]  It's got so much stuff in it, it's so hard to keep clean.
[00:44:29.427 --> 00:44:31.548]  But it is clean, it's excellent.
[00:44:31.548 --> 00:44:42.733]  InfoWarsLife.com, Living Defense, Parasite Harmful Organism Detox, available at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.

[00:44:57.242 --> 00:44:58.162]  Okay.
[00:44:58.162 --> 00:44:58.502]  Wow.
[00:44:58.502 --> 00:45:04.166]  Where to start here?
[00:45:04.166 --> 00:45:09.089]  I want to get to the professor and more on election fraud because this is such a big deal.
[00:45:09.089 --> 00:45:13.031]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:45:13.031 --> 00:45:14.592]  I am grieving for this country.
[00:45:15.754 --> 00:45:19.456]  I am grieving for this country.
[00:45:19.456 --> 00:45:28.220]  I mean, it freaks me out that Democrats don't support Hillary, don't put the stickers on their cars, but I'm sure 30% of the public probably will vote for her.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.161]  I mean, I'm sure there's some real numbers there.
[00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:33.322]  That's what the polls show.
[00:45:33.322 --> 00:45:40.246]  And it's this power trip, like you're part of the power structure, and you're beating your fellow Americans by putting Hillary in.
[00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:47.753]  And you don't care if there's fraud and you buy into all this crap that he's a racist and everything that isn't true and you know it's not.
[00:45:47.753 --> 00:45:51.455]  You just think going along with the herd makes you wonderful.
[00:45:51.455 --> 00:45:56.858]  No, going along with the herd turns the country into North Korea.
[00:45:56.858 --> 00:46:02.842]  So the first thing I want to play before I get to all this is the video that's up on InfoWars.com that I'm going to have red-linked.
[00:46:02.842 --> 00:46:07.725]  We also tweeted it at RealAlexJones.
[00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:09.826]  And this is not our video.
[00:46:09.826 --> 00:46:11.107]  This is not posted to my site.
[00:46:12.042 --> 00:46:14.783]  We've put up our version of it with my commentary.
[00:46:14.783 --> 00:46:20.646]  I could care less about the views, except that I want to absolutely devastate the globalists.
[00:46:20.646 --> 00:46:24.688]  And this video will cut through to even brain dead.
[00:46:24.688 --> 00:46:30.692]  And I think it's one of the best videos out there because it's just what Donald Trump's been saying that we don't ever hear.
[00:46:30.692 --> 00:46:33.013]  I don't have time to sit down and watch most of his speeches.
[00:46:33.013 --> 00:46:39.016]  I watch a few weeks with my kids at night.
[00:46:39.016 --> 00:46:41.197]  And it is so incredibly important.
[00:46:42.142 --> 00:46:48.066]  There's another video up there that proves Donald Trump is right about election fraud that shows the Democrats all admitting it.
[00:46:48.066 --> 00:46:55.491]  But the particular one I'm talking about has the title, This Video Will Get Donald Trump Elected.
[00:46:55.491 --> 00:46:57.772]  And it is so important.
[00:46:57.772 --> 00:46:59.754]  It's the second video down.
[00:46:59.754 --> 00:47:01.675]  This video could win the election for Trump.
[00:47:01.675 --> 00:47:04.537]  Please get it out to everyone you know.
[00:47:05.618 --> 00:47:06.939]  Again, that's the InfoWars version.
[00:47:06.939 --> 00:47:12.585]  We've got posts that were also linked to the Grassroots Fellow that put this together, who I'd love to hire as an editor to work for us here.
[00:47:12.585 --> 00:47:15.948]  We're looking for folks that have the amazing talent that we have here with our current crew.
[00:47:15.948 --> 00:47:23.315]  We've not found people that have the talent yet to find some new people, but we're looking to augment our operation right now with a few more editors.
[00:47:23.315 --> 00:47:29.301]  So, send your resumes in, folks, with a video, and I'll try to hire whoever this is, because they're excellent.
[00:47:30.322 --> 00:47:38.386]  Again, I hear him talk about such amazing things when I actually watch his speeches, and then I realize nobody's seeing those because the news won't show them.
[00:47:38.386 --> 00:47:46.730]  We have to air this here on Talk Radio because even though 90% of our audience every day are regulars, the 10% that tune in and out are millions every day.
[00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:55.815]  I mean, millions of people every day see our videos and our information that have never seen it before and go, whoa, I didn't know Trump was talking like that.
[00:47:58.214 --> 00:48:02.337]  Globalists admit in the WikiLeaks they want to make us poor.
[00:48:02.337 --> 00:48:10.264]  They have set up simple things like higher corporate taxes and letting China have lower currency that aren't fair, so we cannot compete.
[00:48:10.264 --> 00:48:15.328]  You level that, it will absolutely turn the tables.
[00:48:15.328 --> 00:48:18.170]  If he cuts taxes and then just keeps spitting the same,
[00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:21.270]  They'll pay down the debt five trillion dollars.
[00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:23.111]  I mean, this is simple.
[00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:23.972]  People go, what do you mean?
[00:48:23.972 --> 00:48:25.833]  You cut taxes, more money comes in?
[00:48:25.833 --> 00:48:28.954]  That's what happens, folks, at least for three to four years.
[00:48:28.954 --> 00:48:30.615]  It doesn't happen forever.
[00:48:30.615 --> 00:48:33.417]  That's why you can't do it maybe once a decade for maybe four or five years.
[00:48:33.417 --> 00:48:39.740]  But the point is, is that we haven't had a real tax cut in a long time.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.641]  And we need one.
[00:48:41.641 --> 00:48:43.062]  And it's what made America great.
[00:48:44.522 --> 00:48:47.707]  And so Trump isn't perfect, but they know he's not out to get us.
[00:48:47.707 --> 00:48:49.510]  They know he's a real guy.
[00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.114]  He never claimed to be the second coming of Christ.
[00:48:52.114 --> 00:48:55.319]  He never claimed to not be, you know, somewhat of a pig.
[00:48:57.273 --> 00:48:59.095]  And all of us have been, you know, pigs in our lives.
[00:48:59.095 --> 00:49:00.757]  But compared to Hillary Clinton, he's an angel.
[00:49:00.757 --> 00:49:02.499]  This is a monstrous creature.
[00:49:02.499 --> 00:49:07.144]  In the new WikiLeaks, more came out on gun control that they really intend to try to have the abolition.
[00:49:07.144 --> 00:49:11.489]  They're going to try to use executive order, harassment, and taxation to basically take the guns.
[00:49:11.489 --> 00:49:12.790]  And they're going to have a Supreme Court.
[00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.653]  They're going to get four to five new people.
[00:49:14.653 --> 00:49:16.415]  This is the critical election.
[00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.702]  And I'm never a lesser of two evils, guys.
[00:49:19.702 --> 00:49:22.863]  Trump is corrupt just like everybody else.
[00:49:22.863 --> 00:49:25.864]  King David did stuff a lot worse, but I think Trump's heart is right.
[00:49:25.864 --> 00:49:28.885]  But I'm not going to sit here and tell you I'm going for lesser of two evils.
[00:49:28.885 --> 00:49:33.807]  Trump isn't in the same universe or order of magnitude of evil that Hillary is, okay?
[00:49:33.807 --> 00:49:36.428]  Bottom line, he doesn't have the fruits of that.
[00:49:36.428 --> 00:49:38.469]  Hillary is turned over to evil.
[00:49:41.035 --> 00:49:41.696]  There's the latest.
[00:49:41.696 --> 00:49:42.156]  WikiLeaks.
[00:49:42.156 --> 00:49:45.741]  Hillary Clinton had gun control supporters planted in town hall audience.
[00:49:45.741 --> 00:49:47.303]  Of course she did.
[00:49:47.303 --> 00:49:47.564]  Folks...
[00:49:48.973 --> 00:49:53.614]  We break, we cover it, and then our listeners start pointing out almost every one of her town halls.
[00:49:53.614 --> 00:49:55.914]  We kept wondering why the town halls were only like 70 people.
[00:49:55.914 --> 00:49:57.395]  I mean, she can get more than 70.
[00:49:57.395 --> 00:50:00.035]  They can bus in some, you know, elementary school students.
[00:50:00.035 --> 00:50:00.395]  She can get 500.
[00:50:00.395 --> 00:50:02.636]  You know, usually her things have 500,000.
[00:50:02.636 --> 00:50:07.197]  I kept wondering why suddenly a few months ago everything was like a couple hundred, maybe 50, 60, 70.
[00:50:07.197 --> 00:50:08.677]  And we started looking.
[00:50:08.677 --> 00:50:10.037]  They were all actors and actresses.
[00:50:10.037 --> 00:50:12.158]  I'm talking about the kids and stuff that ask questions.
[00:50:12.158 --> 00:50:13.438]  The others were like extras.
[00:50:13.438 --> 00:50:14.578]  This is total scripting.
[00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.459]  I'm going to skip this break, and I'm going to play
[00:50:17.335 --> 00:50:23.056]  This incredibly important video that, again, we have millions of listeners right now.
[00:50:23.056 --> 00:50:26.097]  If you'll go to Infowars.com and get this video.
[00:50:26.097 --> 00:50:33.858]  If you'll tweet it at Trump and others and get it out.
[00:50:33.858 --> 00:50:37.158]  I mean, I don't know how we brand it for folks to share it.
[00:50:37.158 --> 00:50:38.279]  I mean, it's all true.
[00:50:38.279 --> 00:50:41.139]  This video could win the election for Trump.
[00:50:41.139 --> 00:50:41.839]  That's what I said.
[00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:44.860]  That's what I named it.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:45.740]  I don't know.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:46.060]  What about
[00:50:47.279 --> 00:50:49.561]  This is the video the media doesn't want you to see?
[00:50:49.561 --> 00:50:53.304]  Or the Trump video the media doesn't want you to see?
[00:50:53.304 --> 00:50:54.626]  And that's true!
[00:50:54.626 --> 00:51:01.192]  In all their emails and their public statements they say, no more Trump speeches and it came out in WikiLeaks that was four, five, six months ago.
[00:51:01.991 --> 00:51:08.795]  That's when suddenly, they went from showing large portions of his speeches, which was making them, in some cases, CNN and people who never have any audiences.
[00:51:08.795 --> 00:51:11.856]  Imagine, the show's got 200,000 people watching on average.
[00:51:11.856 --> 00:51:13.157]  They put a Trump speech on.
[00:51:13.157 --> 00:51:17.339]  By the end of an hour-long event, they've got 6, 7, 8 million people watching.
[00:51:17.339 --> 00:51:18.340]  They're making money, finally.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.600]  They're not bankrupt.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.781]  They're giving folks what they want.
[00:51:24.943 --> 00:51:26.144]  Then they started baiting and switching.
[00:51:26.144 --> 00:51:31.208]  They would just show an empty podium because that would get raised, but then cut it as soon as Trump got to the podium.
[00:51:31.208 --> 00:51:36.292]  And then bait and switch and have their anti-Trump people there trying to convince Trump viewers that tuned in, you know, don't go for Trump.
[00:51:36.292 --> 00:51:37.733]  And then that didn't work.
[00:51:37.733 --> 00:51:40.115]  So now they just show very short little 10-second clips.
[00:51:40.996 --> 00:51:41.876]  This is what they're doing.
[00:51:41.876 --> 00:51:42.976]  So what do we do?
[00:51:42.976 --> 00:51:45.857]  We get Trump speeches out to everyone.
[00:51:45.857 --> 00:51:48.217]  We get compilation speeches of Trump.
[00:51:48.217 --> 00:51:51.458]  I mean, I've been racking my brain how to get around these people and I figured it out.
[00:51:51.458 --> 00:51:58.460]  We've got to take his speech on the economy, his speech on security, his speech on the election being rigged.
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:03.201]  We've got to edit them down to 5-10 minute blurbs and send them out and say this is what they don't want you to see.
[00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:09.562]  You've got to get people that are on the fence or aren't political to absolutely understand what's happening because
[00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:11.143]  This is historic.
[00:52:11.143 --> 00:52:13.886]  And again, they're going to probably steal it from them, folks.
[00:52:13.886 --> 00:52:16.349]  They're all in.
[00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:17.890]  They're all in.
[00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:27.661]  We have to affect the political, social, cultural battle space so that people understand what happened and so people understand this is all part of a process of our victory.
[00:52:29.775 --> 00:52:30.815]  But the awakening's here.
[00:52:30.815 --> 00:52:32.656]  People now know there's a shadow government.
[00:52:32.656 --> 00:52:34.316]  They know the media is completely rigged.
[00:52:34.316 --> 00:52:35.436]  It isn't liberal bias.
[00:52:35.436 --> 00:52:45.258]  It is criminal, organized racketeering to defraud the public of their election and to deceive the people and to screw us with Obamacare and carbon taxes and the rest of it.
[00:52:45.258 --> 00:52:46.458]  This is a takeover.
[00:52:46.458 --> 00:52:48.678]  This is 21st century war.
[00:52:48.678 --> 00:52:56.080]  So here's the video that I believe, if you get it out, will absolutely cause a landslide they can't steal.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:56.460]  Here it is.
[00:52:57.697 --> 00:53:08.799]  Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people.
[00:53:08.799 --> 00:53:19.941]  The Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exists for only one reason, to protect and enrich itself.
[00:53:19.941 --> 00:53:23.962]  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.
[00:53:24.102 --> 00:53:34.894]  For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind.
[00:53:34.894 --> 00:53:38.318]  Our campaign represents a true
[00:53:39.039 --> 00:53:42.743]  Existential threat like they haven't seen before.
[00:53:42.743 --> 00:53:45.466]  This is not simply another four year election.
[00:53:45.466 --> 00:53:57.859]  This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.
[00:53:57.859 --> 00:54:01.483]  The political establishment that is trying to stop us.
[00:54:02.203 --> 00:54:16.315]  Is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry?
[00:54:17.236 --> 00:54:28.381]  The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico, China, and other countries all around the world.
[00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:44.489]  It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.
[00:54:45.737 --> 00:54:53.803]  This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, and this will be our last chance to save it.
[00:54:53.803 --> 00:55:08.053]  This election will determine whether we're a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged.
[00:55:08.053 --> 00:55:09.374]  This is reality.
[00:55:10.442 --> 00:55:16.968]  You know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it.
[00:55:16.968 --> 00:55:21.412]  The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure.
[00:55:21.412 --> 00:55:27.217]  We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret
[00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:40.443]  With international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.
[00:55:40.443 --> 00:55:43.344]  Honestly, she should be locked up.
[00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:50.811]  The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press.
[00:55:50.811 --> 00:55:52.852]  Let's be clear on one thing.
[00:55:52.852 --> 00:55:57.833]  The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.
[00:55:57.833 --> 00:56:07.497]  They're a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda.
[00:56:07.497 --> 00:56:10.918]  And the agenda is not for you, it's for themselves.
[00:56:11.878 --> 00:56:18.225]  Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe.
[00:56:18.225 --> 00:56:22.369]  They will lie, lie, lie.
[00:56:22.369 --> 00:56:26.132]  And then again, they will do worse than that.
[00:56:26.132 --> 00:56:29.276]  They will do whatever is necessary.
[00:56:29.276 --> 00:56:31.958]  The Clintons are criminals, remember that.
[00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:33.360]  This is well documented.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:50.169]  And the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and the Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power.
[00:56:50.169 --> 00:56:55.852]  They knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones.
[00:56:55.852 --> 00:56:59.514]  They knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.
[00:57:00.234 --> 00:57:06.416]  Nevertheless, I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you.
[00:57:06.416 --> 00:57:11.558]  I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back.
[00:57:11.558 --> 00:57:12.938]  I knew this day would arrive.
[00:57:12.938 --> 00:57:14.779]  It's only a question of when.
[00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:22.395]  And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.
[00:57:22.395 --> 00:57:26.898]  The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.
[00:57:26.898 --> 00:57:31.220]  The only force strong enough to save our country is us.
[00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:37.183]  The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.
[00:57:37.183 --> 00:57:42.005]  Our great civilization has come upon a moment of reckoning.
[00:57:43.231 --> 00:57:45.492]  I didn't need to do this, folks, believe me.
[00:57:45.492 --> 00:57:48.672]  I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life.
[00:57:48.672 --> 00:58:02.196]  I could have enjoyed the fruits and benefits of years of successful business deals and businesses for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions, malicious attacks.
[00:58:02.196 --> 00:58:04.616]  Who would have thought?
[00:58:04.616 --> 00:58:11.338]  I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel so strongly.
[00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:18.454]  That is my turn to give back to the country that I love.
[00:58:18.454 --> 00:58:32.903]  I'm doing this for the people and for the movement and we will take back this country for you and we will make America great again.
[00:58:32.903 --> 00:58:34.604]  Hashtag Trump the establishment.
[00:58:34.604 --> 00:58:35.505]  Get this video out.
[00:58:35.505 --> 00:58:36.726]  Hashtag Trump the establishment.
[00:58:36.726 --> 00:58:39.307]  Find the video at Infowars.com.

[00:58:40.748 --> 00:58:41.509]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:58:43.247 --> 00:58:46.678]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.678 --> 00:58:48.865]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:00:06.738 --> 01:00:09.079]  Poets tell how Poncho fell.
[01:00:09.079 --> 01:00:12.960]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:21.182]  Yeah, if Trump gets stolen, Trump gets robbed, the poets will tell.
[01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:24.383]  Yeah, we're gonna win big time, folks.
[01:00:24.383 --> 01:00:25.964]  We can't lose.
[01:00:25.964 --> 01:00:29.045]  Resistance is victory.
[01:00:29.045 --> 01:00:34.006]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:35.687]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[01:00:37.905 --> 01:00:38.466]  Save a few.
[01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:39.187]  He only did.
[01:00:39.187 --> 01:00:40.409]  And now he's grown old.
[01:00:40.409 --> 01:00:42.112]  A lot of time to be alive.
[01:00:53.154 --> 01:01:21.796]  You know, I don't want to sit here and talk about myself on the broadcast, but we're so central, you're so central, you are the info lord of this, that there was another New York Times and a couple more Washington Posts, an Austin American Statesman, I mean so many I can't even keep track of them, but because they'd asked me to be in the New York Times and the Statesman and I'd said no, I read these articles this weekend and the one in the local paper was like, I was told, it was on Friday, it was like in the front of the front section of the paper, a big spread
[01:01:23.973 --> 01:01:26.920]  I was titled, uh, The Voice Inside Donald Trump's Head.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.664]  I don't have it in front of me because I just remembered this.
[01:01:28.664 --> 01:01:30.830]  I wanted to talk about it this weekend.
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.110]  There it is.
[01:01:32.299 --> 01:01:46.024]  Austin's Alex Jones, the voice in Donald Trump's head, and it goes on to say, Jones is so dangerous because he doesn't just worry about the liberal media, he believes they're part of a global program to deceive the American people and bring us into slavery.
[01:01:46.024 --> 01:01:47.765]  Well, I mean, it's in all the emails.
[01:01:47.765 --> 01:01:51.606]  It says, keep us dumb, make us poor, world government, carbon taxes.
[01:01:51.606 --> 01:01:53.367]  Don't you understand?
[01:01:53.367 --> 01:01:55.607]  It's all public!
[01:01:55.607 --> 01:01:56.688]  Not my interpretation.
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:02.234]  You know we learned about all this because of the John Birch Society in the 50s and 60s.
[01:02:02.234 --> 01:02:07.078]  They had a bunch of people inside the government who were being told, get ready for this takeover.
[01:02:07.078 --> 01:02:11.202]  They were putting it in the newspapers in the 60s, how they were going to bring in UN troops.
[01:02:11.202 --> 01:02:13.384]  That's where that rumor always comes from.
[01:02:13.384 --> 01:02:18.489]  Somewhere I've got like the Washington Post and LA Times with the images of how our troops get smaller.
[01:02:18.489 --> 01:02:19.430]  Well, it's in Memorandum 7277.
[01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:21.372]  It's in the State Department Public Law.
[01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:23.470]  7277.
[01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:26.673]  It shows our helmets getting little and the UN helmets getting big.
[01:02:26.673 --> 01:02:30.277]  Our tanks getting little, their chips getting big.
[01:02:30.277 --> 01:02:32.860]  And then it says we're going to end up turning our guns in.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:34.642]  They tried all this before.
[01:02:34.642 --> 01:02:38.606]  They've been trying it all the time.
[01:02:38.606 --> 01:02:43.731]  So what's frustrating is 95% of what we talk about or more is on the record.
[01:02:45.882 --> 01:02:52.045]  And let me tell you, it's really tough battling something that's public and having an ignorant public laugh at you because the media makes jokes about it.
[01:02:52.045 --> 01:02:57.087]  Kind of like Obamacare being a big screw job, or death panels, or raising prices.
[01:02:57.087 --> 01:03:00.549]  And then Gruber goes on TV and says, thank God you're stupid.
[01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:05.611]  And now Obama's out giving speeches saying they're lying about Obamacare not being free.
[01:03:05.611 --> 01:03:06.512]  I mean, wow!
[01:03:10.811 --> 01:03:12.232]  But you know, it really is a test.
[01:03:12.232 --> 01:03:13.092]  Are you that stupid?
[01:03:13.092 --> 01:03:14.433]  I don't mean our audience, but new listeners.
[01:03:14.433 --> 01:03:16.574]  Because it's in the new WikiLeaks.
[01:03:16.574 --> 01:03:19.255]  Dumped 16, the Podesta emails.
[01:03:19.255 --> 01:03:22.357]  I covered almost exclusively last hour, the email.
[01:03:22.357 --> 01:03:24.998]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:03:24.998 --> 01:03:25.558]  Middle column.
[01:03:25.558 --> 01:03:26.359]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:03:26.359 --> 01:03:27.539]  That's where it came from.
[01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:28.300]  I mean, we've got an article.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.701]  We've got it posted.
[01:03:30.701 --> 01:03:34.963]  WikiLeaks releases fresh batch of emails from Clinton campaign chair.
[01:03:34.963 --> 01:03:35.383]  Yeah.
[01:03:35.383 --> 01:03:36.284]  And then we've got our article.
[01:03:38.609 --> 01:03:46.935]  Where Podesta talks about how to rig the election with the Democrats, and how to get all their major pollsters to over-sample for Hillary, and that's how they're doing it!
[01:03:46.935 --> 01:03:52.739]  And they're doing it the naked way, because they don't care!
[01:03:52.739 --> 01:04:00.965]  So, people ask, why don't you talk to the New York Times, why don't you talk to the Austin Market Station, why don't you talk to Vanity Fair or Esquire anymore?
[01:04:00.965 --> 01:04:06.530]  I don't, they don't even call hardly anymore, because they know I don't talk to them, because they just want me as a prop!
[01:04:07.247 --> 01:04:11.211]  To act like they're real journalists and that they really talk to me.
[01:04:11.211 --> 01:04:13.534]  They'll just take something I said out of context.
[01:04:13.534 --> 01:04:19.500]  Listen, if you want to choose foreign banks and you really want to choose the globalists and you want to do all this, fine.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.743]  But stop acting like we're making stuff up.
[01:04:22.743 --> 01:04:24.165]  They are coming for our guns.
[01:04:24.165 --> 01:04:25.686]  They admit that.
[01:04:25.686 --> 01:04:27.288]  They do believe our families are bad.
[01:04:27.288 --> 01:04:28.830]  They do not believe we have religious freedom.
[01:04:30.612 --> 01:04:33.913]  They're funding radical Islam to take over the Middle East and destabilize things.
[01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:35.554]  I'm not part of this, okay?
[01:04:35.554 --> 01:04:44.657]  So denying these global movements are happening only makes you look like fools, especially now that it's all about to come down.
[01:04:44.657 --> 01:04:45.797]  So Joel Scouse is coming in.
[01:04:45.797 --> 01:04:50.499]  We've got so much to cover today, but I tell you, it is just an insane time to be alive.
[01:04:50.499 --> 01:04:52.780]  They're trying to stir up major wars.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.100]  I've been telling you that for years now.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.281]  The top British general says we're basically at war with Russia right now.
[01:04:57.281 --> 01:04:57.982]  It's all coming up.
[01:04:57.982 --> 01:04:58.402]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:16.941]  Political science professor Helmut Norpoth has accurately predicted the results of the last five presidential outcomes and he says Trump has this in the bag, asserting that Donald Trump has an 87% chance of defeating Clinton despite Clinton being ahead in the polls.
[01:05:16.941 --> 01:05:22.105]  Now this information is in direct contradiction to nearly every mainstream media poll that suggests
[01:05:22.165 --> 01:05:24.305]  Clinton is leading in double digits.
[01:05:24.305 --> 01:05:35.828]  Norpoth's model has correctly predicted the outcome of the popular vote for every election since 1996, including the 2000 race where Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush took the presidency.
[01:05:35.828 --> 01:05:43.389]  He says this of his model, it usually turns out that the candidate who does better in his party's primary beats the other guy who does less well.
[01:05:43.389 --> 01:05:48.490]  Many Trump supporters are now claiming the media spend that the election result is a foregone conclusion.
[01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:52.894]  This conclusion is a trick designed to convince potential voters to stay home on the 8th.
[01:05:52.894 --> 01:05:58.038]  If your puck is correct, we will be looking at President Donald J. Trump come January.
[01:05:58.038 --> 01:06:00.621]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:06:01.465 --> 01:06:05.467]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:06:05.467 --> 01:06:08.449]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:06:08.449 --> 01:06:10.250]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:13.092]  Let me just read a little thing here from Agenda 21.
[01:06:13.092 --> 01:06:17.255]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:06:17.255 --> 01:06:18.695]  Individual rights.
[01:06:18.695 --> 01:06:21.217]  Let's take a back seat to the collective.
[01:06:21.217 --> 01:06:22.798]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:06:23.198 --> 01:06:24.760]  It's gonna be coming after you, Gunn.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.100]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:27.703]  I'll tell you, it ain't gonna set well down my way.
[01:06:27.703 --> 01:06:28.665]  At all.
[01:06:28.665 --> 01:06:29.726]  It ain't gonna set well.
[01:06:29.726 --> 01:06:31.828]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:06:31.828 --> 01:06:33.090]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.072]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:06:35.072 --> 01:06:41.600]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie, and beef.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.701]  What's for supper?
[01:06:43.701 --> 01:06:44.762]  Revelation.
[01:06:44.762 --> 01:06:46.183]  Dawn of global government.
[01:06:46.183 --> 01:06:48.024]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:06:48.024 --> 01:06:49.705]  DVDs now available.
[01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:54.408]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:06:54.408 --> 01:06:57.770]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white and blue?
[01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:58.470]  Revelation.
[01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:59.511]  The movie.
[01:06:59.511 --> 01:07:00.111]  .info.
[01:07:00.111 --> 01:07:00.892]  Let's fix it.
[01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:09.594]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:07:09.594 --> 01:07:10.835]  A 360 win.
[01:07:10.835 --> 01:07:17.397]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:07:17.397 --> 01:07:24.919]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:07:25.319 --> 01:07:29.981]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:07:29.981 --> 01:07:36.484]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:07:36.484 --> 01:07:44.288]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:07:44.288 --> 01:07:51.171]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:52.312]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:07:52.452 --> 01:07:54.895]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:54.895 --> 01:07:56.877]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:07:56.877 --> 01:08:03.986]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:08:03.986 --> 01:08:06.649]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:11.816]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:33.101 --> 01:08:37.083]  Now, I've been really busy, obviously, and so have the listeners getting ready for this election.
[01:08:37.083 --> 01:08:48.630]  We're 14 days out, and I've been wanting to get Joel Skousen into town for the last month, but he's been busy with the World Affairs Brief and also advising folks on high-security homes across the United States.
[01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:49.511]  So he's here with us.
[01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:52.672]  On two subjects that will be with us some of the next hour.
[01:08:52.672 --> 01:08:59.016]  And I believe we have Project Veritas giving us an exclusive, if not today, later this evening on the nightly news.
[01:08:59.016 --> 01:09:00.817]  But they're still finishing it up.
[01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:04.659]  Right now they've had some security issues as well.
[01:09:04.659 --> 01:09:08.061]  But never have things been more naked and out in the open.
[01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:10.883]  That we have a big corporate combine running the country.
[01:09:10.883 --> 01:09:15.045]  We have special interests running the media, giving them exact talking points.
[01:09:15.045 --> 01:09:17.407]  We have them being caught on TV doing it.
[01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:20.754]  We also have the emails where they're running it.
[01:09:20.754 --> 01:09:24.260]  We have new Wikileaks DataDump 16 on Podesta.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:31.512]  Hillary's chief of staff, back in February, coordinating with the media to oversample the polls they pay for.
[01:09:32.478 --> 01:09:36.040]  Oversample 9 to 45 points, sometimes higher.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:44.303]  I mean, I've seen some samples that are insane, where, you know, they do 25% conservatives, 45% Democrats, and the other is independents, mainly Democrats.
[01:09:44.303 --> 01:09:48.285]  So, Hillary is just incredibly unpopular.
[01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:49.606]  Can't get crowds to come out.
[01:09:51.425 --> 01:09:52.906]  It's amazing.
[01:09:52.906 --> 01:09:59.869]  And we've got on screen one of those, but what I really want to show for TV viewers is the one that's linked on DrugsReport.com.
[01:09:59.869 --> 01:10:05.131]  New Podesta email exposes playbook for rigging pulls through oversamples.
[01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:09.613]  And he's telling their media buyer in the email, I want to get this ready now.
[01:10:09.613 --> 01:10:10.553]  This is how you're going to do it.
[01:10:10.553 --> 01:10:11.574]  We're going to oversample.
[01:10:12.423 --> 01:10:12.663]  I think so.
[01:10:37.603 --> 01:10:41.728]  Illusion that a Hillary win is actually reality-based.
[01:10:41.728 --> 01:10:46.894]  That's why the New York Times, CNN, all of them have the headlines that Hillary's going to win by a landslide.
[01:10:46.894 --> 01:10:47.975]  Trump's already lost.
[01:10:47.975 --> 01:10:53.141]  He might throw the towel in, we keep hearing every week, because Hillary's going to win in such a landslide.
[01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:54.844]  Don't go to the polls.
[01:10:54.844 --> 01:10:57.366]  There is no election fraud, but we've got to federalize it now.
[01:10:58.544 --> 01:11:00.305]  Joel Schaus is here for the next hour and a half or so.
[01:11:00.305 --> 01:11:02.487]  I was asking him, what do you want to hit first?
[01:11:02.487 --> 01:11:09.993]  The situation in Turkey that you're an expert on, the situation in Syria, what's happened with all these Russian build-ups in the Mediterranean.
[01:11:09.993 --> 01:11:11.214]  What do you want to hit first?
[01:11:11.214 --> 01:11:20.382]  He said, well, let's hit the consolidation of media and what the whole alt-right speech of Hillary, where I and others like Stephen Bannon and Breitbart were named,
[01:11:20.922 --> 01:11:28.466]  And then he pointed out that the Business Insider says the GOP must do something about the conservative media industrial complex it wants to survive.
[01:11:28.466 --> 01:11:39.213]  Now notice, they've said this on MSNBC, they've said this in the New York Times, they've said it in the Washington Post, they've said it in the Austin American-Statesman this weekend, that I'm the evil creature that's in the ear.
[01:11:39.213 --> 01:11:44.696]  In fact, they even wrote a local article as well that said I'm a devil, that I'm satanic.
[01:11:44.696 --> 01:11:46.317]  That was in the Chronicle this weekend.
[01:11:46.317 --> 01:11:49.639]  And that I am influencing them like a literal devil.
[01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:58.814]  So this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with here, because by the end of the piece he says, it's Alex Jones that's the devil.
[01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:02.316]  So I don't want to talk about myself, except this is what they're saying.
[01:12:02.316 --> 01:12:03.917]  Now the truth is it's not Alex Jones.
[01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:05.337]  It's not my talking points.
[01:12:05.337 --> 01:12:07.378]  It's not the John Birch Society's talking points.
[01:12:07.378 --> 01:12:13.962]  It's not Joel Skousen or his famous Uncle Cleon Skousen, you know, the granddaddy of the modern resistance, or Barry Goldwater.
[01:12:14.662 --> 01:12:16.744]  We're facing a real thing.
[01:12:16.744 --> 01:12:18.325]  So we see the same thing.
[01:12:18.325 --> 01:12:19.266]  We have its emails.
[01:12:19.266 --> 01:12:20.586]  We have its documents.
[01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.448]  We had moles 60 years ago.
[01:12:22.448 --> 01:12:28.132]  We've been trying to hold it back, but they want to make it that it's from Alex Jones because I'm flamboyant or whatever.
[01:12:28.132 --> 01:12:32.435]  They want to cut it out like it's a made-up cosmology that came from me.
[01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:33.936]  Joel Skousen, great to be here.
[01:12:33.936 --> 01:12:34.437]  Thank you.
[01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:40.101]  You've got the floor at least for the next five, ten minutes before we go to break on why you think this is central to cover and what you think this signifies.
[01:12:41.155 --> 01:12:55.568]  I think the important point that I want to make, Alex, is that they're trying to turn around the fact that we have made the case that there is a vast mainstream media conspiracy against Donald Trump and against the conservative, or at least the constitutional conservative movement.
[01:12:56.428 --> 01:13:00.449]  They're trying to paint now this conservative media industrial complex.
[01:13:00.449 --> 01:13:04.870]  That's a key word for the military industrial complex, which we've always complained about.
[01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:09.992]  You know, controlling wars because it's profitable for people, as well as being part of the globalist agenda.
[01:13:09.992 --> 01:13:20.255]  But the key thing is that here in this article in Business Insider, where they don't mention you, by the way, you know, they talk about the fact that the whole thing that the Republican establishment has to
[01:13:21.459 --> 01:13:35.287]  The fight against is they've got to kill this conspiracy movement because it's taking root into what has caused the Donald Trump momentum to come as they realize there is a conspiracy of mainstream Republicans to betray the conservative roots.
[01:13:35.287 --> 01:13:36.688]  And they're trying to kill it.
[01:13:36.688 --> 01:13:46.534]  In this article they admit what you need to do, he's talking to people, is you need to call all the advertisers to Glenn Beck, to Rush Limbaugh, to Sean Hannity and threaten them
[01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:56.406]  They say in the article you need to threaten them that you're going to be blackballed if you continue to advertise with Fox News or Sean Hannity.
[01:13:56.406 --> 01:14:00.109]  And obviously Beck knew this purge was coming that's why he totally got on board a year ago.
[01:14:00.109 --> 01:14:01.110]  That's right.
[01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.891]  Now the point is this is an admission of conspiracy.
[01:14:03.891 --> 01:14:07.474]  I mean Breitbart doesn't have people threatening the advertisers on CNBC.
[01:14:08.553 --> 01:14:13.236]  Rush Limbaugh doesn't send people to threaten NBC or CNN or any of those you see.
[01:14:13.236 --> 01:14:14.897]  This is an admission of conspiracy.
[01:14:14.897 --> 01:14:23.702]  They're going to try to conspire to destroy the financial base of the... And they've already, by the way, behind the scenes on local AM and FM's, not just myself.
[01:14:23.702 --> 01:14:25.823]  There's a lot of patriots locally in each town.
[01:14:25.823 --> 01:14:30.806]  No matter how high their ratings, icons in towns, cities, have been just taken off the air.
[01:14:30.806 --> 01:14:33.367]  And they put fake conservatives on just the last year.
[01:14:33.367 --> 01:14:35.008]  Well, look at what happened to Michael Savage.
[01:14:35.008 --> 01:14:36.449]  I mean, they literally took him off the air.
[01:14:36.969 --> 01:14:39.192]  Without any, you know, notice whatsoever.
[01:14:39.192 --> 01:14:41.375]  And he was having a powerful effect.
[01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:52.328]  So, there is a mainstream conspiracy against The Rising Point, but I thought it was very interesting that even though they have attacked you directly in certain hit pieces, in this piece in Business Insider they failed to mention
[01:14:53.396 --> 01:15:03.100]  The power of Alex Jones in producing the type of resistance to the mainstream, and I really think that you are a... That means the power of our audience and our guests.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:06.641]  I'm not trying to, like, you know, defer the praise.
[01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:15.485]  It really is the audience, it's the guests, it's this whole operation that in many cases I'm probably one of the least effective things, but that's how God works on the system I've built.
[01:15:15.925 --> 01:15:33.598]  But expanding on that, they had a Washington Post and a New York Times article that said the same thing in the last week, that quote, Breitbart and Infowars have had an insurrection of the Republican Party and a hostile takeover was the headline, and have now taken it over, so you better kick them out or it's over for your party.
[01:15:33.598 --> 01:15:34.358]  That's what they actually said.
[01:15:34.358 --> 01:15:34.959]  That's what they're saying.
[01:15:35.499 --> 01:15:37.421]  In fact, that's why they want a landslide.
[01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:43.087]  They want to engineer a landslide for Hillary Clinton so they can say to all of you, you see, this is what happens when you listen to Alex Jones.
[01:15:43.087 --> 01:15:47.092]  This is what happens when you believe these phony conspiracy theories.
[01:15:47.092 --> 01:15:48.073]  So how do we counter that?
[01:15:49.636 --> 01:15:59.788]  Well, one of the things that we have to get people to do on our side is to really be careful about what they listen to because they are feeding phony conspiracies into the mix.
[01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:08.859]  We even accidentally had one that I caught and took down that was linked to another article that said that the Russians had basically infiltrated Alaska.
[01:16:08.859 --> 01:16:09.720]  That got up on the site.
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.121]  That's right.
[01:16:11.121 --> 01:16:17.906]  And, you know, I try in the World Affairs Brief, I almost cover once a week at least two or three little stories that need to be debunked.
[01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:22.969]  For example, there was a story about jets taking off in San Diego with afterburner.
[01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:30.314]  Of course, they don't realize as a fighter pilot, you know, that all jets take off, all fighter pilots take off in afterburner, even in regular, you know, circumstance.
[01:16:30.314 --> 01:16:32.296]  They talk about booms being heard.
[01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:34.317]  They talked about the same thing in Seattle.
[01:16:34.317 --> 01:16:35.098]  It was just bogus.
[01:16:35.418 --> 01:16:37.519]  I mean, there are people feeding this kind of stuff on the internet.
[01:16:37.519 --> 01:16:45.542]  They talked about the Russians putting out a call that all the families are going to be called home in England and the United States, a prelude to war, and it wasn't true.
[01:16:45.542 --> 01:16:46.982]  Nobody got called home.
[01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:52.204]  And, of course, it was a Russian source that put this out, so that people thought it must be true.
[01:16:52.204 --> 01:16:53.485]  But, in fact, it wasn't true.
[01:16:53.485 --> 01:16:58.527]  So, there's all kinds of things that feed, and you go around and share these things with people, and they get discredited.
[01:16:58.527 --> 01:17:01.548]  And that's what they want to do, is so that when they hear true conspiracies,
[01:17:02.572 --> 01:17:03.732]  They don't know how to navigate them.
[01:17:03.732 --> 01:17:12.476]  Well, I've caught a lot of sites that we know are government and corporate connected, where they just spew disinfo all day and then mix our info into it so that people get confused and distracted.
[01:17:12.476 --> 01:17:20.999]  But I think we've reached a point, Joel Skousen, where the mainstream media is so discredited and people are even wise to that, that this tactic isn't working.
[01:17:20.999 --> 01:17:24.560]  So if they do try to steal this election and try to then discredit the Liberty Movement,
[01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:30.028]  They failed in Brexit, but now they're threatening to basically destroy the UK financially if they don't go along with it.
[01:17:30.028 --> 01:17:32.593]  What's the next shoe to drop then if they do steal the election?
[01:17:33.919 --> 01:17:41.123]  Well, they have to deal with the fact that the Trump movement, the populist movement, he, you know, Ron Paul built the movement by twice when he ran for president.
[01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:42.824]  And Donald Trump has doubled it again.
[01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:43.925]  Or more.
[01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:44.625]  Or more.
[01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:46.046]  Because he's brought in populism.
[01:17:46.046 --> 01:17:56.373]  You know, Ron Paul was a very principled conservative movement, constitutional conservative, and Ron Paul has expanded that to a populist, you know, dissatisfaction with the media, which is extremely widespread.
[01:17:56.373 --> 01:17:58.294]  It's the largest phenomenon that we've seen.
[01:17:58.294 --> 01:18:03.337]  And even David Brooks and Mark Shields on NPR were talking about the fact, you know,
[01:18:03.837 --> 01:18:07.561]  You know what really worries me is the fact that people hate us.
[01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:11.945]  And he says this is the first time we've ever faced this as the establishment media is that people hate us.
[01:18:11.945 --> 01:18:13.567]  Yeah, they're not the goofy liberals anymore.
[01:18:13.567 --> 01:18:20.454]  We know they're organized PSYOP officers getting talking points by multinational corporations working against our republic.
[01:18:21.823 --> 01:18:22.523]  Yes, that's right.
[01:18:22.523 --> 01:18:28.766]  What are they going to do when we're getting, no exaggeration now, 50 million views on different video platforms a week?
[01:18:28.766 --> 01:18:33.648]  I mean, what are they going to do now that there's mom and pops popping up that get videos with 20 million views?
[01:18:33.648 --> 01:18:38.049]  I mean, our movement is just exploding right now.
[01:18:38.049 --> 01:18:39.410]  They've got to be in panic mode.
[01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:42.231]  They are in panic mode, and that's why the censorship is rising.
[01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:43.612]  I mean, Google is censoring things.
[01:18:43.612 --> 01:18:47.173]  You can't do a search on gun rights without getting skewed to gun control.
[01:18:47.173 --> 01:18:48.274]  I did it myself.
[01:18:48.274 --> 01:18:51.595]  Before I came on, you type in gun rights and gun control, gun control.
[01:18:51.595 --> 01:18:52.955]  So they're taking the gloves off.
[01:18:52.955 --> 01:18:55.216]  They're really, you know, really trying to skew.
[01:18:55.216 --> 01:18:57.397]  This is a China-type censorship of the Internet.
[01:18:57.397 --> 01:19:04.880]  They're talking about on Facebook, which they're already, you know, censoring many people about taking down anything that can be construed as hate speech.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.842]  And they're going to say that everything you or I put out is hate speech.
[01:19:07.842 --> 01:19:08.842]  And so it's going to be censored.
[01:19:08.882 --> 01:19:13.106]  Oh, that's what the paper, both papers said that I'm like this king of hate.
[01:19:13.106 --> 01:19:15.988]  They're the ones saying I'm racist because I don't like Obamacare.
[01:19:15.988 --> 01:19:17.409]  They're the ones saying I should be locked up.
[01:19:17.409 --> 01:19:18.770]  They're the ones demonizing.
[01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:20.612]  They're the ones coming after us.
[01:19:20.612 --> 01:19:22.113]  Skip this break.
[01:19:22.113 --> 01:19:25.816]  Yeah, they have a powerful way to what I call the media drumbeat.
[01:19:25.816 --> 01:19:30.280]  I mean, it's just like the imbalance between the sins of Donald Trump and of Hillary Clinton.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.081]  I mean, look at the balance of the thing.
[01:19:32.081 --> 01:19:34.703]  You have credible people talking about, you know,
[01:19:36.192 --> 01:19:44.120]  Donald Trump making advances, and I think they're fairly credible, except for the one person on the airliner, because Donald Trump never did fly in economy class.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:49.786]  But the point is, there are credible women who talk about Hillary Clinton sniffing cocaine.
[01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:54.410]  There are women talking about her lesbian and bisexual relationship.
[01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:56.352]  And it never gets anything in the press.
[01:19:56.352 --> 01:19:56.693]  It's not fair!
[01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:00.415]  It's just not fair, and that is manipulation of the election.
[01:20:00.415 --> 01:20:03.997]  I mean, it starts, for example, in the primary season.
[01:20:03.997 --> 01:20:12.761]  It starts when I was a political scientist, and they were going to run the Democrats against George H.W.
[01:20:12.761 --> 01:20:14.662]  Bush, and they said, who are the top Democrats?
[01:20:14.662 --> 01:20:17.224]  And all of a sudden, Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and I said, who?
[01:20:17.224 --> 01:20:17.864]  Who's Bill Clinton?
[01:20:17.864 --> 01:20:19.645]  I mean, I was a political scientist.
[01:20:19.645 --> 01:20:25.869]  I was watching the media, and nobody knew who Bill Clinton was, except that the media was saying he's one of the top picks for the Democrats.
[01:20:25.869 --> 01:20:26.429]  Well, says who?
[01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:28.812]  That's the way that they manipulate this.
[01:20:28.812 --> 01:20:38.242]  Now, when you have people like Mitt Romney and Donald Trump insert themselves in the political process with their own money, that is what has skewed the system.
[01:20:38.242 --> 01:20:43.929]  They've been able to break through the kingmaker, appointed system that has been ruling America for so long.
[01:20:43.929 --> 01:20:44.970]  Ronald Reagan broke through it.
[01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:50.098]  Because of the very sheer charisma and his true conservative prowess that he had.
[01:20:50.098 --> 01:20:55.827]  But of course they put him in a locker hold when they forced him to take George H.W.
[01:20:55.827 --> 01:20:56.287]  Bush's president.
[01:20:56.287 --> 01:20:57.329]  And then they shot him.
[01:20:57.329 --> 01:20:59.112]  And then they shot him to make a real believer out of him.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.702]  So, we've had a very controlled election.
[01:21:02.702 --> 01:21:06.105]  They wanted to give us, in this election, a controlled Republican.
[01:21:06.105 --> 01:21:07.907]  Donald Trump stopped that.
[01:21:07.907 --> 01:21:15.233]  Despite his flaws, you know, this nation has got to realize that Hillary Clinton, her type of corruption is different than Donald Trump's.
[01:21:15.233 --> 01:21:17.334]  Her type of corruption is systematic.
[01:21:17.334 --> 01:21:18.215]  It's within the system.
[01:21:18.215 --> 01:21:18.976]  It's organized.
[01:21:18.976 --> 01:21:20.077]  It's organized.
[01:21:20.077 --> 01:21:25.561]  She has a complete team of people who... And she represents the very central core of globalists.
[01:21:25.561 --> 01:21:28.804]  I mean, she represents the creme de la creme of evil.
[01:21:29.504 --> 01:21:33.507]  Even though she isn't one of the top planners of Globalist, she is a puppet like Barack Obama.
[01:21:33.507 --> 01:21:34.828]  She takes orders and things.
[01:21:34.828 --> 01:21:37.350]  I mean, there are people like Henry Kissinger and other people.
[01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.830]  Oh, I agree.
[01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:43.294]  Well, she admits, she says, I take my orders from the Council on Foreign Relations and Henry Kissinger, just like General Jones said.
[01:21:43.294 --> 01:21:46.937]  Yeah, General Jones made that admission in 2009 at the Munich Security Conference.
[01:21:46.937 --> 01:21:50.279]  He gets his daily marching orders from Henry Kissinger.
[01:21:50.279 --> 01:21:58.505]  So how do they deal with this paradox, though, where they're announcing global carbon taxes, taxing by the mile, the family's bad, world government's here,
[01:21:59.306 --> 01:22:01.027]  But Alex Jones is insane.
[01:22:01.027 --> 01:22:02.928]  Obamacare is free.
[01:22:02.928 --> 01:22:06.591]  I mean, how do they sit there and continue to get away with this?
[01:22:06.591 --> 01:22:10.253]  Because they have less and less credibility.
[01:22:10.253 --> 01:22:26.003]  This is the real core problem, Alex, is that they're dealing with a rising consciousness within a... I'm afraid to say this, but it still is, I think, a slight majority compared to the dumbed-down electorate and the benefit-corrupted people which are growing.
[01:22:26.528 --> 01:22:31.343]  I agree, but the slight majority doesn't know it still has the power, and it thinks it's a minority.
[01:22:31.894 --> 01:22:32.494]  That's right.
[01:22:32.494 --> 01:22:36.297]  And they still continue to call themselves the minority, the beleaguered minority.
[01:22:36.297 --> 01:22:43.102]  Oppressed, and that's what the Business Insider tried to do, oppressed by this mainstream, or this big, monolithic... Which it is!
[01:22:43.102 --> 01:22:43.622]  ...organization.
[01:22:43.622 --> 01:22:52.828]  We have the Clinton Foundation from their library documents, the Judicial Watch got, and World Daily got a few years ago, thousands of pages, and it's like, we can't let a new press grow.
[01:22:52.828 --> 01:22:54.849]  We must suppress it ever getting its funding.
[01:22:54.849 --> 01:22:57.751]  We have to call it a conspiracy of right-wingers and shut it down.
[01:22:57.751 --> 01:22:59.452]  We have to stick the IRS on it.
[01:22:59.452 --> 01:23:01.714]  I mean, it's an admission of criminal activity against us.
[01:23:02.174 --> 01:23:04.795]  But it also shows how worried they are, Alex.
[01:23:04.795 --> 01:23:06.036]  I mean, they really are worried.
[01:23:06.036 --> 01:23:10.578]  They wouldn't be attacking Donald Trump to the degree that they are if they weren't worried about him winning.
[01:23:10.578 --> 01:23:16.621]  I mean, that shows that despite all of the disadvantage we've had for so many years, the movement has grown exponentially.
[01:23:16.621 --> 01:23:18.522]  Your efforts, Donald Trump's efforts, and otherwise.
[01:23:18.522 --> 01:23:19.583]  And so despite the flaws,
[01:23:20.359 --> 01:23:21.620]  They are worried about this.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:22.741]  They're worried about Europe.
[01:23:22.741 --> 01:23:24.682]  I mean, Europe is in major revolt.
[01:23:24.682 --> 01:23:27.464]  All 25 EU nations are moving to pull out.
[01:23:27.464 --> 01:23:27.965]  That's right.
[01:23:27.965 --> 01:23:30.367]  And Brexit is a success.
[01:23:30.367 --> 01:23:32.928]  But they're trying to sabotage it, putting in Theresa May.
[01:23:32.928 --> 01:23:34.410]  And she is sabotaging.
[01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:43.516]  I pointed out in the World Affairs Brief that she put in this bill before Congress that inculcates all EU law into British law.
[01:23:43.516 --> 01:23:44.397]  Everything.
[01:23:44.397 --> 01:23:46.859]  In other words, we're pulling out of Brexit, we're going to put in British law.
[01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:53.801]  And so it will no longer be under the world jurisdiction, the World International Court.
[01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:59.065]  But the point is, if it's in British law, that means the British courts have to enforce EU law.
[01:23:59.065 --> 01:24:00.006]  Well, let's talk about this then.
[01:24:00.006 --> 01:24:01.347]  When was the John Birch Society founded?
[01:24:02.415 --> 01:24:02.936]  What, 1956?
[01:24:02.936 --> 01:24:04.557]  Okay, so let's say 1956.
[01:24:04.557 --> 01:24:08.361]  Let's say the number of people awake is pretty low.
[01:24:08.361 --> 01:24:12.706]  I mean, the public generally was more moral, but it was a low amount, would you agree, that was aware of the conspiracy?
[01:24:12.706 --> 01:24:13.247]  That's right.
[01:24:13.247 --> 01:24:19.734]  Now, you know, let's say in 2016, it's exponential and it seems to be going straight up.
[01:24:19.734 --> 01:24:21.976]  If you guys have a document cam, I can show people this.
[01:24:23.408 --> 01:24:26.251]  I mean, do you basically agree with that graph?
[01:24:26.251 --> 01:24:27.292]  Absolutely.
[01:24:27.292 --> 01:24:27.912]  So what do they do?
[01:24:27.912 --> 01:24:33.277]  They're going to bring in authoritarianism very quickly and start shutting down the press basically in the next year.
[01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:34.998]  I think they have to be careful with that, though.
[01:24:34.998 --> 01:24:37.721]  They want to make sure that people stay fat, dumb, and happy.
[01:24:37.721 --> 01:24:41.764]  No, no, I agree with you, but I'm saying then that gives us more time.
[01:24:41.764 --> 01:24:43.266]  Because, I mean, aren't they screwed either way?
[01:24:44.161 --> 01:24:50.904]  They are, and that's why ultimately they're going to bring us a war, because war gives them the excuse to suppress any dissent.
[01:24:50.904 --> 01:24:51.884]  And it's going to be ruthless.
[01:24:51.884 --> 01:24:56.306]  You haven't seen anything until war comes, and when they can have a wartime agenda.
[01:24:56.306 --> 01:24:59.867]  I mean, look at the false patriotism that is enjoined when war comes.
[01:24:59.867 --> 01:25:05.930]  And clearly, you know, nobody's laughing about my predictions about Russia and China being the aggressor against the United States.
[01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:07.390]  You've been saying it for 20 years.
[01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:08.151]  For 20 years.
[01:25:08.151 --> 01:25:08.991]  Now it's materialized.
[01:25:08.991 --> 01:25:11.092]  It's coming true and nobody's laughing anymore.
[01:25:11.092 --> 01:25:13.893]  And the trouble is we got too much hype about it being coming too early.
[01:25:14.941 --> 01:25:20.043]  I think I'm convinced, and I think we'll talk about this at a later time, you know, I think it takes more time.
[01:25:20.043 --> 01:25:21.403]  Russia and China really aren't ready.
[01:25:21.403 --> 01:25:25.405]  Listen, I hope you're right that it's in six, seven, you know, five years or whatever.
[01:25:25.405 --> 01:25:26.525]  I hope it never happens.
[01:25:26.525 --> 01:25:27.886]  But clearly we see it's that direction.
[01:25:27.886 --> 01:25:32.408]  But I'm not saying you're wrong, but look at how Syria popped up and Putin did something we didn't think would happen.
[01:25:32.408 --> 01:25:33.448]  They admit they're not ready.
[01:25:33.448 --> 01:25:34.488]  I had Colonel Schaefer on.
[01:25:34.488 --> 01:25:37.289]  He said, our military's not ready yet.
[01:25:37.289 --> 01:25:41.611]  So clearly neither military wants it, and they're talking to each other.
[01:25:41.611 --> 01:25:44.112]  But the elites tend to be pretty unstable.
[01:25:45.768 --> 01:25:49.470]  Yes, but they need this war to ultimately lock down the opposition.
[01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:52.031]  There's nothing that's going to stop this growing opposition.
[01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:52.652]  Nothing, Alex.
[01:25:52.652 --> 01:26:00.716]  And that's why they're ahead of time branding any opposition to the establishment as being Russian agents, so when this war comes, they can grab whoever they want.
[01:26:00.716 --> 01:26:04.278]  They blackballed Russia already, but at the same time, the U.S.
[01:26:04.278 --> 01:26:07.360]  is still trying to do another disarmament agreement with Russia.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.741]  I mean, talk about hypocrisy.
[01:26:09.441 --> 01:26:13.428]  Blaming Donald Trump for being a Russian agent, you see, and the Russians hacking them.
[01:26:13.428 --> 01:26:18.136]  And yet the same administration is still trying to negotiate another Russian disarmament agreement.
[01:26:18.136 --> 01:26:22.283]  Well, look at Podesta getting his brother and all the money and Hillary involved in all this coming out.
[01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:27.412]  Well, sure, and you look at, you know, the Hillary Clinton pay-for-play in Haiti.
[01:26:27.412 --> 01:26:30.493]  All of the friends of Hillary Clinton, they got these big contracts.
[01:26:30.493 --> 01:26:33.074]  Nothing to do with refugee relief.
[01:26:33.074 --> 01:26:34.835]  What do you think's wrong with Hillary looking at her?
[01:26:34.835 --> 01:26:38.577]  I mean, clearly, she was in and out of the hospital in 2002, in 2013, in 2012.
[01:26:38.577 --> 01:26:42.078]  The word is she's got serious neurological problems.
[01:26:42.078 --> 01:26:43.959]  Secret Service just said start watching her.
[01:26:43.959 --> 01:26:45.740]  A month later, she fell down.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.781]  She looks really bad, then she looks okay.
[01:26:47.781 --> 01:26:48.261]  What's happening?
[01:26:49.124 --> 01:26:49.964]  Well, it's kind of interesting.
[01:26:49.964 --> 01:26:50.985]  She has hypothyroid.
[01:26:50.985 --> 01:26:54.887]  Hypothyroid leads to a tremendous amount of susceptibility to other diseases.
[01:26:54.887 --> 01:27:01.150]  Heart disease, cancer, which we saw that she had a cancerous growth on her tongue, excise, so she is susceptible to cancer.
[01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:03.972]  But I think she's actually got a form of Parkinson's disease.
[01:27:04.592 --> 01:27:12.377]  I've talked to several doctors who confirm that what we're seeing is probably the reaction to some of her Parkinson's type drugs that she's taking.
[01:27:12.377 --> 01:27:23.364]  It tends to calm the nervous system and yet at some point it causes a hyper nervous response to things when you see the head jerking and the other things that happen.
[01:27:23.364 --> 01:27:27.767]  But you know she is still pretty strong when she is hyped up on whatever drugs they keep her on.
[01:27:27.767 --> 01:27:29.308]  Oh she looks like she's on amphetamines.
[01:27:30.530 --> 01:27:42.397]  And, uh, she's also taking a lot of, uh, you know, skin, uh, rejuvenating type, uh, things, not Botox particularly, but, you know, for all those wrinkles to disappear on the debate, they, she had to have a lot of cosmetics.
[01:27:42.397 --> 01:27:42.577]  Sure.
[01:27:42.577 --> 01:27:43.837]  What about blood transfusions?
[01:27:43.837 --> 01:27:46.819]  Some of the elite do a lot of those.
[01:27:46.819 --> 01:27:52.122]  I can't say whether she's using that, but I know that she, they, she's being pumped up by a lot of medical, medical intervention.
[01:27:52.122 --> 01:27:55.904]  And that's why it fails at certain points and she collapses and, and, but, uh,
[01:27:56.711 --> 01:28:03.177]  I don't think her problems are chronic enough to keep her from acting as president, and they're going to keep her propped up, is my feeling.
[01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:06.940]  And they probably like that even more that she's degrading, because that gives them even more control.
[01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:14.386]  Yeah, and they can also, I mean, like Richard Nixon, they kept him hyped up on drugs and lowered on drugs so that Henry Kissinger could continue to run the administration.
[01:28:14.386 --> 01:28:18.270]  That was revealed by one of the insiders in the Nixon administration.
[01:28:19.278 --> 01:28:23.260]  Joel, you wanted to get some into Russia and also what's happening in Syria.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:31.984]  I mean, we now know that our military to a great extent did not want to go along with backing ISIS and Al-Qaeda, but hopefully you can break down some of the angles and factions of how this is happening.
[01:28:31.984 --> 01:28:35.765]  You also pointed out that there's a report that they're pulling the U.S.
[01:28:35.765 --> 01:28:42.769]  troops out of one area of Mosul and other areas so that some of the ISIS people can get out.
[01:28:42.769 --> 01:28:47.010]  So I want to get your World Affairs Brief, you're the editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com obviously, on
[01:28:48.371 --> 01:28:52.275]  Your best intel from your sources and research where that whole conflict is.
[01:28:52.275 --> 01:28:57.260]  Because obviously, that's the doorway to bring in all these Islamists into Europe and the U.S.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:00.783]  And that's the next question we start answering now in 30 seconds.
[01:29:00.783 --> 01:29:03.286]  What is really behind bringing in all these radical jihadis?
[01:29:05.959 --> 01:29:09.841]  In Europe, it is, of course, to create absolute conflict, and that's what's happening.
[01:29:09.841 --> 01:29:12.162]  Sweden has been destroyed by these men.
[01:29:12.162 --> 01:29:19.466]  In the United States, this, you know, they've used the Mexican immigration to basically dilute conservative voting power in the United States.
[01:29:19.466 --> 01:29:20.426]  And that's really worked.
[01:29:20.426 --> 01:29:27.530]  I mean, they are going to, it's not just 11 million that they're going to legalize when Hillary takes office, it's going to be 30 to 40 million.
[01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:29.471]  And I don't think we'll ever win another election again.
[01:29:29.471 --> 01:29:32.993]  Who will then be branded thinking, hey, I'm a liberal, that's my friend.
[01:29:33.513 --> 01:29:40.337]  And there's just no way for patriots to reach out, I guess, and try to wake up that historically, you know, conservative family-wise group.
[01:29:40.337 --> 01:29:42.578]  Absolutely true, yeah.
[01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:47.361]  And that's why the globalists are so arrogant and now reversing into pure race-based politics.
[01:29:47.361 --> 01:29:50.983]  We'll be back with Joel Skousen, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:50.983 --> 01:29:54.905]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.905 --> 01:29:57.607]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.724 --> 01:30:03.144]  We're red on election day.
[01:30:03.144 --> 01:30:06.265]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[01:30:06.265 --> 01:30:10.867]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[01:30:10.867 --> 01:30:18.289]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[01:30:18.289 --> 01:30:19.950]  This is happening right in front of us.
[01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:24.351]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[01:30:24.411 --> 01:30:26.433]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[01:30:26.433 --> 01:30:29.817]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[01:30:29.817 --> 01:30:36.685]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[01:30:36.685 --> 01:30:39.449]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[01:30:39.449 --> 01:30:42.933]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[01:30:42.933 --> 01:30:44.735]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[01:30:44.935 --> 01:30:48.137]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on Election Day.
[01:30:48.137 --> 01:30:51.999]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[01:30:51.999 --> 01:30:58.143]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[01:30:58.143 --> 01:31:01.025]  Wear red on Election Day and make America great again.
[01:31:01.565 --> 01:31:03.646]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[01:31:03.646 --> 01:31:04.866]  Try a bottle of it.
[01:31:04.866 --> 01:31:06.447]  Rob Dew joins us.
[01:31:06.447 --> 01:31:09.568]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[01:31:09.568 --> 01:31:10.669]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:11.629]  I'd been working all day.
[01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:14.090]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:15.511]  I get in here at 830.
[01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:17.431]  I was kind of run down.
[01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:19.132]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it.
[01:31:19.352 --> 01:31:21.234]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[01:31:21.234 --> 01:31:23.075]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[01:31:23.075 --> 01:31:24.136]  I popped two of them.
[01:31:24.136 --> 01:31:26.419]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[01:31:26.419 --> 01:31:28.200]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.862]  It's got four and a half stars.
[01:31:29.862 --> 01:31:31.203]  People really love it.
[01:31:31.203 --> 01:31:31.804]  Read about it.
[01:31:31.804 --> 01:31:35.627]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise.
[01:31:35.627 --> 01:31:40.912]  Because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:31:41.052 --> 01:31:45.115]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:31:45.115 --> 01:31:51.280]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:57.185]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:32:01.325 --> 01:32:04.607]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:32:04.607 --> 01:32:08.689]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:11.350]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:14.192]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[01:32:14.192 --> 01:32:19.375]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[01:32:19.935 --> 01:32:26.144]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[01:32:26.144 --> 01:32:27.586]  God was in school.
[01:32:27.586 --> 01:32:29.488]  Morality had a future.
[01:32:29.488 --> 01:32:32.412]  And beef was for supper.
[01:32:32.412 --> 01:32:34.996]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:32:35.356 --> 01:32:36.517]  We're the solution!
[01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:37.518]  Americans!
[01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:39.019]  Ain't nothin' more to it than that!
[01:32:39.019 --> 01:32:44.424]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:32:44.424 --> 01:32:46.145]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:32:46.145 --> 01:32:47.667]  DVDs now available.
[01:32:47.667 --> 01:32:51.590]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:57.195]  RevelationTheMovie.info Americans need to see this film.
[01:32:57.195 --> 01:33:00.718]  RevelationTheMovie.info Let's fix it!
[01:33:18.207 --> 01:33:22.040]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.101 --> 01:33:47.093]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have our living defense product that is the Harmful Organism Cleanse that's all the old wives' tale herbs and things, and then also high-tech compounds that are natural and healthy to flush out the body of parasites.
[01:33:47.093 --> 01:33:48.134]  You've heard listeners call in.
[01:33:48.134 --> 01:33:49.375]  It's got five-star reviews.
[01:33:49.375 --> 01:33:54.339]  It's sold out most of the time because it's so hard to source this formula because it's got so many things in it.
[01:33:54.779 --> 01:33:59.906]  And everything we sell, we shoot for California standards, which are nearly impossible.
[01:33:59.906 --> 01:34:05.633]  So we keep testing with the third parties that produce some of the biggest organic labs in the country.
[01:34:06.499 --> 01:34:06.659]  It's
[01:34:36.899 --> 01:34:39.322]  This is the stuff that they're selling in clinics in Europe, okay?
[01:34:39.322 --> 01:34:41.003]  We have a big cold facility here.
[01:34:41.003 --> 01:34:43.165]  It's produced in the top lab in the U.S.
[01:34:43.165 --> 01:34:45.507]  We went and said we want total Rolls-Royce.
[01:34:45.507 --> 01:34:48.670]  Rip was doing this seven years ago, but he could never get it until now.
[01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:55.936]  And it's two different strengths, 50 billion live and active cultures, 25 million live and active cultures shipped to you in a cold pack.
[01:34:55.936 --> 01:34:59.500]  This is, because look, I could come out and private label hundreds of different
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:02.140]  Probiotics, okay?
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:03.581]  This is the best.
[01:35:03.581 --> 01:35:08.722]  You go to Whole Foods, they've got Rolls Royce type stuff that cost more than this, that isn't even as good.
[01:35:08.722 --> 01:35:10.602]  This is what I take, what my family takes.
[01:35:10.602 --> 01:35:11.942]  It is amazing.
[01:35:11.942 --> 01:35:14.523]  Try it out for yourself and know you're funding this operation.
[01:35:14.523 --> 01:35:18.943]  Infowarslive.com, infowarsstore.com, or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:35:18.943 --> 01:35:19.664]  Now, also, you can get on DVD,
[01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:38.876]  The documentary presentation, it's over three hours long, and that is Strategic Relocation, the film and the big color book that Joel Skousen published at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:38.876 --> 01:35:46.359]  And believe me, it is the best research on the safest places to live in the U.S., in the world, demographics on politics, and so much more.
[01:35:46.359 --> 01:35:47.760]  It's incredibly accurate.
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.921]  And I basically am looking to try to find somewhere new outside Austin to live.
[01:35:52.921 --> 01:35:56.743]  And I'm going off of this and quite frankly never got to part two.
[01:35:56.743 --> 01:36:06.646]  Trying to get Joel to come out here for a few days and travel around with me to try to find the best place where I could still, you know, get in and out of town, but basically live during the weekend.
[01:36:06.646 --> 01:36:12.688]  Because I've gone from believing it's a probability we're going to have societal collapse to a certainty.
[01:36:12.688 --> 01:36:15.929]  The question is how and at what order and why.
[01:36:15.929 --> 01:36:16.929]  But the globalists want it.
[01:36:17.509 --> 01:36:35.103]  They don't want civilization for the general public, that's their plan, and they're orchestrating this long-term collapse and war, and so I am moving from being somewhat prepared to totally prepared, because my kids come first, and I've politically tried to fix this as much as I can, and we still are.
[01:36:35.103 --> 01:36:35.843]  We've got a lot of hope.
[01:36:35.843 --> 01:36:39.726]  Good things are happening, but we're up against very, very evil people.
[01:36:39.726 --> 01:36:42.849]  WorldAffairsBrief.com is his excellent news site.
[01:36:42.849 --> 01:36:45.591]  Again, Joel Skousen is our guest here in studio.
[01:36:47.981 --> 01:37:00.966]  We had some nice banner in the last 30 minutes, but big picture, geopolitically with what's happening in the Middle East, what's happening in Central Asia, what's happening with Russia, Ukraine.
[01:37:00.966 --> 01:37:02.927]  Can you give us an analysis on that?
[01:37:02.927 --> 01:37:13.531]  And then I know you wanted to get specifically into Syria and yeah, Turkey, which has always been part of NATO, at least since World War II, or at the end of World War II, cozying up to Russia.
[01:37:13.531 --> 01:37:14.632]  What's going on there?
[01:37:15.902 --> 01:37:22.308]  Well, first of all, in the big picture, it's very important to realize that there are three major predator centers in the world.
[01:37:22.308 --> 01:37:25.571]  There are the Anglo-American globalists that we're fighting.
[01:37:25.571 --> 01:37:27.052]  There's the Russians and the Chinese.
[01:37:27.052 --> 01:37:30.395]  All three of them want to establish a global new world order controlled by them.
[01:37:30.395 --> 01:37:33.718]  Now, the Russians and Chinese are temporarily in alliance.
[01:37:33.718 --> 01:37:36.260]  They'll know they'll eventually have to go at each other.
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:38.922]  But they want to join together, first of all, to take down the West.
[01:37:38.922 --> 01:37:40.784]  Now, they don't want to destroy the Western economy.
[01:37:41.536 --> 01:37:44.678]  That's why they're planning on a nuclear preemptive strike on U.S.
[01:37:44.678 --> 01:37:48.480]  military forces so they can blackmail the West into submission.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:50.542]  Now, our globalists know this.
[01:37:50.542 --> 01:37:54.764]  They know that the Russians and Chinese aren't intending to nuke cities, but going after the military.
[01:37:54.764 --> 01:38:03.330]  They're going to let that happen, and that's why PDD-60 was signed by President Clinton in 1997, basically instructing our nuclear forces, don't rely on launch on warning.
[01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:07.553]  But prepare to absorb a nuclear first strike and then retaliate afterwards.
[01:38:07.553 --> 01:38:10.715]  And General Butch Neal of the Marine Corps said, retaliate with what?
[01:38:10.715 --> 01:38:12.957]  Once you absorb a nuclear first strike.
[01:38:12.957 --> 01:38:17.521]  Now, it's true that our military still continues to practice launch on warning.
[01:38:17.521 --> 01:38:23.986]  Launch on warning is very important because it means that when our satellites detect Russian and Chinese launching against us,
[01:38:24.827 --> 01:38:29.008]  That if they launch our missiles while theirs are in the air... It's mad.
[01:38:29.008 --> 01:38:31.869]  Their missiles... No, it's not a mad... It's not a total destruction.
[01:38:31.869 --> 01:38:34.990]  What it is, is their missiles hit empty silos.
[01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:38.191]  Our missiles are in the air and hit active targets.
[01:38:38.191 --> 01:38:42.412]  So the one who launched... I understand because we know which silos have launched and which are about to launch.
[01:38:42.412 --> 01:38:42.752]  That's right.
[01:38:43.012 --> 01:38:47.616]  So launch on warning, it means that the one who launches second wins.
[01:38:47.616 --> 01:38:56.742]  And when our military says, when our government says to them, don't rely on launch on warning, be prepared to absorb a nuclear first strike, it means they're not going to get the launch codes.
[01:38:56.742 --> 01:38:57.823]  They still practice it.
[01:38:57.823 --> 01:39:01.106]  They still think they're going to be able to do it, but those codes won't come.
[01:39:01.106 --> 01:39:03.588]  That's why they can't afford to have... And they admit that's the case.
[01:39:03.588 --> 01:39:05.149]  So why has Congress allowed this to happen?
[01:39:06.052 --> 01:39:07.053]  Because they don't know about it.
[01:39:07.053 --> 01:39:10.316]  Nobody talks about PDD-60 because, first of all, it's still secret.
[01:39:10.316 --> 01:39:11.458]  I published in the World Affairs Bureau.
[01:39:11.458 --> 01:39:13.680]  Sure, but even the cover page admits it.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.822]  I mean, they have a summary that's public.
[01:39:15.822 --> 01:39:18.205]  Yeah, but it's never been discussed in Congress.
[01:39:18.205 --> 01:39:18.865]  I've looked.
[01:39:18.865 --> 01:39:20.106]  They've never discussed it.
[01:39:20.106 --> 01:39:24.831]  But they made movies arguing, well, we've got to do this because we can't let, you know, crazy submarine commanders nuke everybody.
[01:39:25.552 --> 01:39:26.893]  That's what they're saying is the excuse.
[01:39:26.893 --> 01:39:38.842]  In fact, in the same year, 1997, President Clinton agreed unilaterally to keep 50% of our submarines in port at any one time to make them more vulnerable to a Russian attack to prove that we have no hostile intentions.
[01:39:38.842 --> 01:39:39.483]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:39:39.483 --> 01:39:45.267]  If you're going to be belligerent to Russia and try to start a war, why then put yourself in a posture that says attack us?
[01:39:45.267 --> 01:39:46.929]  Because the U.S.
[01:39:46.929 --> 01:39:47.849]  can't start this war.
[01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:49.971]  They've got to be the victim.
[01:39:49.971 --> 01:39:51.131]  They've got to be the victim.
[01:39:51.131 --> 01:39:51.651]  This is important.
[01:39:51.651 --> 01:39:54.993]  So they can come out of their bunkers, our leaders, and say, we've been victimized.
[01:39:54.993 --> 01:39:57.174]  Now, we've talked about this a lot on air, and I agree with you.
[01:39:57.174 --> 01:39:58.314]  That's the way the world's going.
[01:39:58.314 --> 01:40:00.735]  And you're dead on target with World Affairs Brief.
[01:40:00.735 --> 01:40:01.816]  Here's the problem.
[01:40:01.816 --> 01:40:04.557]  It's a fact that national Russian TV watches us.
[01:40:04.557 --> 01:40:06.097]  I don't want to brag about this.
[01:40:06.097 --> 01:40:06.918]  I knew it 10 years ago.
[01:40:08.834 --> 01:40:11.117]  It's not just them trying to be friendly and manipulate us.
[01:40:11.117 --> 01:40:11.557]  It's true.
[01:40:11.557 --> 01:40:14.602]  A lot of the Russian intelligentsia listens to this show.
[01:40:14.602 --> 01:40:15.683]  They watch it.
[01:40:15.683 --> 01:40:18.667]  I was told this by the head of RT America like eight years ago, nine years ago.
[01:40:18.667 --> 01:40:23.815]  I've been told by other high-level folks that have been over to Russia and have actually met with Putin.
[01:40:24.235 --> 01:40:31.498]  And of course they play clips of my show on national Russian TV that Putin's best buddy, you know, heads up the Russian state media.
[01:40:31.498 --> 01:40:33.178]  And it sounds like Alex Jones now.
[01:40:33.178 --> 01:40:38.520]  And they're doing all this stuff, paying people to have kids, not letting them push the anti-family agenda in schools.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.681]  Again, I understand that it's still got all that old hardline stuff.
[01:40:41.681 --> 01:40:48.283]  I'm not trying to say that they're the good guys, but, I mean, is it possible Russia could actually understand what's happening and not be manipulated into this?
[01:40:48.283 --> 01:40:49.024]  They don't believe me.
[01:40:49.024 --> 01:40:49.644]  That's the problem.
[01:40:50.435 --> 01:40:51.335]  But they're watching.
[01:40:51.335 --> 01:40:52.756]  I know, but they don't believe me.
[01:40:52.756 --> 01:40:53.876]  They think that the U.S.
[01:40:53.876 --> 01:40:55.557]  is going to try to nuke them.
[01:40:55.557 --> 01:40:56.417]  They think the U.S.
[01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:58.077]  is going to try to trick them.
[01:40:58.077 --> 01:40:58.597]  Okay?
[01:40:58.597 --> 01:41:00.738]  Okay, we'll talk to Russia right now.
[01:41:00.738 --> 01:41:01.858]  Camera 4.
[01:41:01.858 --> 01:41:02.999]  Go ahead.
[01:41:02.999 --> 01:41:05.540]  What I'm trying to tell them is they're being set up for a trap.
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:08.120]  They know that you're only going to hit American military forces.
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:13.402]  They actually want American military forces to be taken down because they have secret weapon systems.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:22.449]  That they're going to bring out after that first strike to keep any further nuclear weapons from falling while they regroup and talk us into joining a militarized global government.
[01:41:22.449 --> 01:41:24.752]  We've got a paper global government in the UN.
[01:41:24.752 --> 01:41:27.395]  It's going to be militarized with taxation.
[01:41:27.395 --> 01:41:31.780]  All of the draconian things, martial law, that you've always talked about will come true when there's a war.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.322]  And that's why all the stuff's been set up.
[01:41:33.322 --> 01:41:33.682]  That's right.
[01:41:33.682 --> 01:41:34.323]  Because they're not ready.
[01:41:34.483 --> 01:41:37.664]  Now, in order to induce, Russia and China aren't ready yet.
[01:41:37.664 --> 01:41:40.684]  In order to induce them to strike, they have to feign weakness.
[01:41:40.684 --> 01:41:42.125]  That's the old Chinese proverb.
[01:41:42.125 --> 01:41:43.525]  And that's why we're disarming.
[01:41:43.525 --> 01:41:48.546]  That's why we took three warheads off of our Minuteman III missiles and reduced them to one.
[01:41:48.546 --> 01:41:51.827]  That's a two-thirds disarmament, unilaterally.
[01:41:51.827 --> 01:41:53.547]  While engaging in provocations.
[01:41:53.547 --> 01:41:58.748]  How about this Philippine leader running to China, meeting with the President, getting all these honors.
[01:41:58.748 --> 01:41:59.768]  When the U.S.
[01:41:59.768 --> 01:42:02.389]  President lands, they make him come off the back of the plane, yell at him.
[01:42:02.389 --> 01:42:03.469]  I mean, what are those snubs about?
[01:42:04.246 --> 01:42:14.378]  Well, Duterte actually is a radical leftist populist, and he is naturally inclined to the Russians, and that's why he's kind of thumbing his nose at the United States.
[01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:17.822]  However, the Philippine people are still pro-American, and they will want to.
[01:42:17.822 --> 01:42:19.264]  But I think that we can see
[01:42:20.585 --> 01:42:23.708]  You know, Philippines make a deal with China so they don't get invaded.
[01:42:23.708 --> 01:42:28.833]  I think China in this next war, the beginning of the next war, got a grudge match against Japan.
[01:42:28.833 --> 01:42:30.875]  I think they're going to launch against Japan.
[01:42:30.875 --> 01:42:33.557]  They'll take Japan all the way down through Australia.
[01:42:33.557 --> 01:42:35.519]  They own all of the middle rights in Australia.
[01:42:35.519 --> 01:42:37.441]  They have to occupy Australia.
[01:42:37.441 --> 01:42:42.706]  That's why Australia is not a good strategic relocation, you know, place for Americans.
[01:42:42.706 --> 01:42:44.527]  Just like the Japanese had to take that whole
[01:42:45.367 --> 01:42:49.589]  ...arc of violence, so China will do that at the beginning of the war.
[01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:51.310]  And they've got the troops to do it.
[01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:58.774]  But my theory is that the globalists will make a deal with China in World War III to cut a deal to betray Russia.
[01:42:58.774 --> 01:43:03.317]  Well, clearly that's been the plan at least since they opened up the talks in the 70s.
[01:43:03.857 --> 01:43:18.547]  So I think Russia will be eliminated in World War III, and then China becomes the new Cold War enemy, and the globalists want that, because then they can say, we can't disarm this great big global military we built, because we need to have a defense against this new Cold War enemy.
[01:43:18.547 --> 01:43:19.448]  And ensure the peace.
[01:43:19.448 --> 01:43:21.870]  Yeah.
[01:43:21.870 --> 01:43:25.612]  Well, clearly the globalists, the Anglo-American establishment, have sided with China.
[01:43:25.612 --> 01:43:30.956]  They've been given most of the big ports, the Panama Canal, 98% of rare earth minerals now.
[01:43:30.956 --> 01:43:32.217]  They've been given a strategic
[01:43:33.624 --> 01:43:38.008]  Leg up, and the CFR folks say it's the Chinese century, on and on and on.
[01:43:38.008 --> 01:43:40.650]  They're allowed to infiltrate their spies.
[01:43:40.650 --> 01:43:47.595]  Russia, on the other hand, has been encircled, is being, having sanctions put on it, is being infiltrated.
[01:43:47.595 --> 01:43:49.076]  Soros has been trying to overthrow it.
[01:43:49.076 --> 01:43:53.660]  I mean, wouldn't they rather just overthrow it early, instead of having to have the nuclear war?
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.841]  No, they want the conflict.
[01:43:54.841 --> 01:43:56.682]  They have to have something as dramatic as that.
[01:43:56.682 --> 01:43:59.545]  So trying to overthrow publicly, and Soros bragging about it.
[01:44:00.322 --> 01:44:02.204]  He is meant to just stir Russia up.
[01:44:02.204 --> 01:44:02.965]  Yes, exactly.
[01:44:02.965 --> 01:44:09.351]  You see, you've got to remember that they have to allow Putin to go before his people and appear that Russia is the victim.
[01:44:10.003 --> 01:44:12.806]  You know, take advantage of Russian resurgent nationalism.
[01:44:12.806 --> 01:44:16.469]  We want to resurge as a powerful nation, as a world power.
[01:44:16.469 --> 01:44:23.235]  And so by having, by the globalists providing a lot of antagonism, military exercises on the border, threats of NATO.
[01:44:23.235 --> 01:44:27.939]  And Trump ends all that because he's being advised by General Flynn and others, and that's who's mainly advising him.
[01:44:27.939 --> 01:44:30.141]  Former head of defense intelligence saying, don't do that.
[01:44:30.141 --> 01:44:31.722]  And it looks like Flynn's a pretty smart cookie.
[01:44:31.722 --> 01:44:32.283]  What do you know about him?
[01:44:32.603 --> 01:44:34.005]  Yeah, I think he is right.
[01:44:34.005 --> 01:44:36.447]  He knows that there's no reason to provoke Russia.
[01:44:36.447 --> 01:44:39.371]  And the provocation of Russia is not to start a nuclear war.
[01:44:39.371 --> 01:44:42.894]  The provocation is to give Putin an excuse to go before his people and look like the victim.
[01:44:42.894 --> 01:44:44.556]  And you've been saying the Russians aren't listening.
[01:44:44.556 --> 01:44:45.898]  I don't know that's the case.
[01:44:45.898 --> 01:44:47.680]  No, I'm saying they don't believe me.
[01:44:48.505 --> 01:44:49.685]  Exactly.
[01:44:49.685 --> 01:44:51.666]  They're listening, but they're not listening.
[01:44:51.666 --> 01:44:52.926]  But I know our military is.
[01:44:52.926 --> 01:44:58.628]  And I don't want to, again, lionize them, because Lord knows the Army and people are, you know, that's who buries the bodies and does the hanging.
[01:44:58.628 --> 01:45:02.589]  But, I mean, I've just found the Army, more than any other group, is super awake.
[01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:04.309]  The Marines are super awake.
[01:45:04.309 --> 01:45:05.770]  Navy, somewhat, but not so much.
[01:45:05.770 --> 01:45:06.910]  Their leaders aren't, though.
[01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:08.451]  Their leaders are politically correct.
[01:45:08.451 --> 01:45:10.211]  They've been trained at these... No, I understand.
[01:45:10.211 --> 01:45:16.073]  They had to remove a bunch of people because... Look what they've done with transgenders and allowing the feminists into the military.
[01:45:16.073 --> 01:45:17.193]  They've feminized our military.
[01:45:17.193 --> 01:45:19.514]  Those are litmus tests to get it set up.
[01:45:19.514 --> 01:45:21.074]  But still, they haven't fully conquered it.
[01:45:21.074 --> 01:45:24.055]  That's got to concern the establishment.
[01:45:24.055 --> 01:45:24.475]  It does.
[01:45:24.475 --> 01:45:29.797]  It's because the mid-grade, field-level officers and below read your stuff.
[01:45:29.797 --> 01:45:31.317]  They understand what the threat is.
[01:45:31.317 --> 01:45:33.398]  They're very anti-establishment.
[01:45:33.398 --> 01:45:35.739]  They're very anti-Hillary Clinton, in fact.
[01:45:35.739 --> 01:45:38.380]  They know that she... I call them super aware.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:39.500]  They're super aware.
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:45.642]  But the leaders of all of the major services, including the Joint Chiefs, are all... Sure, how high did you go in the Marine Corps before...
[01:45:46.511 --> 01:45:48.132]  Oh, actually, I got out as a captain.
[01:45:48.132 --> 01:45:51.995]  They wouldn't have someone, you know, in me who was not going to toe the line.
[01:45:51.995 --> 01:45:58.979]  In fact, I got knocked out of my squadron because I wouldn't go to stag nude parties where they had prostitutes.
[01:45:58.979 --> 01:46:07.845]  All this was before the Navy tailhook scandal where that got clamped down on, but I was given an unsatisfactory... So you wouldn't cheat on your wife, so that was it?
[01:46:07.845 --> 01:46:08.205]  That was it.
[01:46:08.205 --> 01:46:13.369]  I was given an unsatisfactory fitness report because, on loyalty to Skipper, because I wouldn't go to these parties.
[01:46:14.130 --> 01:46:19.893]  And when I did a congressional investigation afterwards, the Marine Corps said there is no such fitness report.
[01:46:19.893 --> 01:46:26.576]  They had sent another one emergency to OIA to get the skipper to sign it again and replaced it with an excellent fitness report.
[01:46:26.576 --> 01:46:29.518]  I mean, that's the kind of cover-up that went back, you know, clear in the 1970s.
[01:46:31.328 --> 01:46:33.349]  Well, but that got you out early so you could start this fight.
[01:46:33.349 --> 01:46:34.149]  That's right.
[01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:37.370]  And it was a godsend because this is where I'm really comfortable.
[01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:42.913]  And you ended up leading kind of the proto-Tea Party, the first big move to try to save the Republican Party.
[01:46:42.913 --> 01:46:43.473]  That's right.
[01:46:43.473 --> 01:46:46.194]  I was chairman of the conservative national committee in Washington, D.C.
[01:46:46.194 --> 01:46:50.136]  during the Reagan administration to put pressure on the Reagan administration to stop these compromises.
[01:46:50.136 --> 01:46:53.097]  By the way, the conservative national committee, there's been a left-wing financed
[01:46:53.337 --> 01:47:00.341]  A conspiracy theory, that I work for that, and that it secretly runs the country, when I wish it did.
[01:47:00.341 --> 01:47:07.304]  We wouldn't be in this situation, but it's crazy how they, now we know in the WikiLeaks, they create their own conspiracy theories that are made up.
[01:47:07.304 --> 01:47:07.745]  They do.
[01:47:07.745 --> 01:47:10.806]  They talked about- That's what you said!
[01:47:10.806 --> 01:47:13.568]  We're running this big combine, it's said that we've got to be shut down.
[01:47:13.568 --> 01:47:14.788]  We're the conspiracy.
[01:47:14.788 --> 01:47:15.869]  Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:47:15.869 --> 01:47:16.709]  That's so ironic.
[01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:19.771]  The conspiracy calling the non-conspirators black.
[01:47:19.771 --> 01:47:21.612]  You know, it's just incredible.
[01:47:24.278 --> 01:47:27.920]  Wow, okay, getting into Syria now.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:29.482]  How is that going for the globalists?
[01:47:29.482 --> 01:47:31.383]  The backstory is very, very important on this.
[01:47:31.383 --> 01:47:37.006]  The reason we got into Syria was the fact that, remember in 2004-2008, the US had three carrier groups offshore Iran threatening to
[01:47:44.011 --> 01:47:46.573]  Start a war over this program.
[01:47:46.573 --> 01:47:49.655]  Well, it turned out that Israel refused to start that war.
[01:47:49.655 --> 01:47:55.739]  They were going to fly an attack in there and bomb Iranian nuclear reactors, and then the U.S.
[01:47:55.739 --> 01:47:57.480]  would come in and finish the job.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:03.424]  But Israel told the U.S., we're not going to do this until you take out Syria, because they're right on our border.
[01:48:03.424 --> 01:48:05.926]  They have thousands of missiles, chemical weapons.
[01:48:05.926 --> 01:48:06.727]  They can obliterate us.
[01:48:07.699 --> 01:48:09.420]  If we start a war with Iran.
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:09.920]  So the U.S.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.782]  agreed to take Syria out three years ago.
[01:48:11.782 --> 01:48:12.862]  Remember that?
[01:48:12.862 --> 01:48:15.024]  And for Israel, that's smart, because they don't want a two-front war.
[01:48:15.024 --> 01:48:15.864]  That's right.
[01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:19.146]  And so they had this no-fly zone, which is not just a no-fly zone.
[01:48:19.146 --> 01:48:19.807]  It's like Libya.
[01:48:19.807 --> 01:48:23.769]  It's where you're going to have cruise missiles and everything coming in.
[01:48:23.769 --> 01:48:32.354]  And what happened is John Kerry got before a London press conference and a very savvy reporter said, hey, it's obvious you're going to invade Syria.
[01:48:32.354 --> 01:48:34.836]  Is there any way, anything that Syria can do to stop this?
[01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:40.907]  And John Kerry just off the top of it said, yeah, they could give up their chemical weapons and we wouldn't be able to attack.
[01:48:40.907 --> 01:48:42.488]  And Syria said, we accept.
[01:48:42.488 --> 01:48:44.630]  And Russia said, we accept for Syria.
[01:48:44.630 --> 01:48:47.433]  And so all of a sudden it stopped the globalist agenda cold.
[01:48:47.433 --> 01:48:51.276]  They couldn't go through with the no-fly zone because they agreed to come in.
[01:48:52.217 --> 01:49:02.470]  Let me get the red line, but the jihadis funded out of Saudi Arabia are so dumb, they filmed trophy videos of them launching the chemical attacks and then even the UN had to admit it was really basically Saudi Arabia.
[01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:05.533]  The US tried to falsify that Assad was using chemical weapons.
[01:49:05.533 --> 01:49:06.454]  I mean, why would he do that?
[01:49:06.454 --> 01:49:08.577]  He knew that they were trying to get after him.
[01:49:08.577 --> 01:49:10.739]  You don't use chemical weapons in the middle of a city.
[01:49:10.739 --> 01:49:11.020]  Anyways.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.903]  I mean, because it's an area weapon.
[01:49:13.903 --> 01:49:14.644]  It's a battlefield weapon.
[01:49:14.644 --> 01:49:15.544]  It's an area weapon.
[01:49:15.544 --> 01:49:17.527]  You know, you can't just target people like that.
[01:49:17.527 --> 01:49:18.748]  So, it was stupid.
[01:49:18.748 --> 01:49:22.131]  Nobody would believe in the military that Assad would use chemical weapons.
[01:49:22.131 --> 01:49:23.893]  But it came in from Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
[01:49:23.893 --> 01:49:25.335]  It was old sarin gas.
[01:49:25.335 --> 01:49:28.358]  It was given to the rebels to do and to blame it on Assad.
[01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:35.954]  But the point is, once they couldn't get into Syria, they had to create ISIS.
[01:49:35.954 --> 01:49:37.835]  And this is the real way that ISIS created.
[01:49:37.835 --> 01:49:40.577]  It has nothing to do with pulling out of Iraq too early.
[01:49:40.577 --> 01:49:47.902]  It has to do with the fact they took about 50% of the Syrian rebels, which they were financing and running through Saudi Arabia using Israeli Mossad agents.
[01:49:48.939 --> 01:49:50.741]  And they said, you're now ISIS.
[01:49:50.741 --> 01:49:52.283]  How else do you explain a 50,000 man army?
[01:49:52.283 --> 01:49:53.184]  Well, they admit that.
[01:49:53.184 --> 01:50:01.693]  They sheep-dipped it to change the name and then brought in proxy armies and then resupplied them in that new area that's part of eastern Iraq and western Syria.
[01:50:01.693 --> 01:50:02.054]  That's right.
[01:50:02.054 --> 01:50:02.775]  And that is why.
[01:50:02.775 --> 01:50:03.535]  And the proof is this.
[01:50:04.196 --> 01:50:05.896]  Why, when Iraq called the U.S.
[01:50:05.896 --> 01:50:12.698]  and said, look, there's these weapons depots out there, there's a massive armed force getting ready to attack us, we want you to bomb this, and the U.S.
[01:50:12.698 --> 01:50:15.419]  refused, because they knew it was our people that were doing it.
[01:50:15.419 --> 01:50:22.340]  But then, the new media exposed that, our own military protested this, and so they kind of halfway backed off.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:24.041]  Yeah, well, they just became a little more careful.
[01:50:24.041 --> 01:50:28.842]  I mean, it's like in Mosul, you know, in the invasion of Mosul by the armies, and the Iraqi army left.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.983]  They had a big victory parade down a major highway out of Mosul, and the U.S.
[01:50:32.983 --> 01:50:33.984]  military knew about it.
[01:50:33.984 --> 01:50:34.985]  They didn't attack it.
[01:50:34.985 --> 01:50:36.206]  Why wouldn't they attack it?
[01:50:36.206 --> 01:50:40.129]  Because it was a convoy of ISIS that they wanted preserved.
[01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:45.854]  When Fallujah was retaken, they allowed all the ISIS fighters to escape with their weapons.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.522]  Specified and in most of the doing the same thing they open up the whole West.
[01:50:50.522 --> 01:50:51.722]  So now it's happening again.
[01:50:51.722 --> 01:50:53.143]  What's the next step there?
[01:50:53.143 --> 01:50:56.164]  We're going to break world affairs brief calm.

[01:53:00.848 --> 01:53:02.649]  Hi, my name is Stephen Holstein.
[01:53:02.649 --> 01:53:07.551]  In my 20s, I abused stimulants and antibiotic steroids to the point where my adrenal glands were shot.
[01:53:07.551 --> 01:53:10.633]  I suffered from extreme fatigue and an inability to handle stress.
[01:53:10.633 --> 01:53:17.336]  For over six years, I have been taking adrenal supplements including herbs, glandulars, vitamin C, and vitamin B5.
[01:53:17.336 --> 01:53:21.258]  All these supplements did was treat the symptoms and produced only minimal results.
[01:53:21.258 --> 01:53:26.421]  Now, just after one month on Synergy One and ADR Medix, I truly feel rejuvenated.
[01:53:26.641 --> 01:53:33.505]  I have never felt such relaxation before from any adrenal supplement as I did just 10 minutes after taking ADR Medix.
[01:53:33.505 --> 01:53:37.828]  I then noticed Synergy One made me wake up rested and with much more energy.
[01:53:37.828 --> 01:53:40.870]  No more hungover, groggy feeling upon arising.
[01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:48.995]  I had almost considered going to another country for stem cell therapy as a last resort, but now I truly feel rejuvenated on Synergy One and ADR Medix.
[01:53:49.457 --> 01:53:51.741]  Success happens with synergistic nutrition.
[01:53:51.741 --> 01:53:54.305]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:53:54.305 --> 01:53:56.389]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:54:30.962 --> 01:54:38.949]  Phil Schausen is our guest here in studio for another 30 minutes, and then we have the folks from Project Veritas joining us on their latest video.
[01:54:38.949 --> 01:54:40.370]  Hillary Clinton approved.
[01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:42.792]  Robert Kramer planned directly.
[01:54:42.792 --> 01:54:49.618]  Yes, Hillary micromanages this stuff to go out and steal the votes, go out and engage in disinformation, all the incredible Project Veritas info.
[01:54:49.618 --> 01:54:52.401]  Now they've not told us yet what the big crisis was Friday, and they don't...
[01:54:53.001 --> 01:54:55.025]  They don't run around with, you know, cry wolf stuff.
[01:54:55.025 --> 01:54:55.927]  They were really concerned.
[01:54:55.927 --> 01:54:59.315]  They're like, we have to get you videos in case something bad happens.
[01:54:59.315 --> 01:55:00.116]  And I said, what is it?
[01:55:00.116 --> 01:55:01.199]  Well, the worst ever.
[01:55:02.079 --> 01:55:03.219]  He's been arrested.
[01:55:03.219 --> 01:55:05.060]  He's been charged before.
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:05.860]  They've come after him.
[01:55:05.860 --> 01:55:07.301]  I mean, Project Veritas is a lot of courage.
[01:55:07.301 --> 01:55:08.321]  So I don't know what that was.
[01:55:08.321 --> 01:55:09.021]  They haven't told us.
[01:55:09.021 --> 01:55:17.604]  A lot of times, you know, people then decide to batten down the hatches, but we'll try to dig it out of them coming up in about 35 minutes from now.
[01:55:17.604 --> 01:55:24.686]  But the latest video is up on Infowars.com, and of course, Breitbart.com has that as well.
[01:55:26.146 --> 01:55:26.727]  There's another one.
[01:55:26.727 --> 01:55:30.689]  Racist social justice warriors terrorize owners of cat sanctuary.
[01:55:30.689 --> 01:55:35.792]  I'm not a big cat person, but my youngest daughter wanted a cat.
[01:55:35.792 --> 01:55:39.875]  So I said, well, let's go check out cats first and try to get one that's a rescue cat.
[01:55:39.875 --> 01:55:45.658]  A lot of times we went to this cat sanctuary place in East Austin.
[01:55:45.658 --> 01:55:46.619]  I'm going off of a side story.
[01:55:46.619 --> 01:55:48.260]  This is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:48.980]  To look at cats.
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:50.241]  And I said, you know, we're not going to get a cat.
[01:55:50.241 --> 01:55:52.623]  Let's give a donation because they got hundreds of these cats are taken care of.
[01:55:53.396 --> 01:55:55.741]  We finally did get a cat, so I just know these people.
[01:55:55.741 --> 01:55:58.106]  These are like nice liberals.
[01:55:58.106 --> 01:56:03.839]  The communists started protesting them, then they glued the doors shut, sprayed racist white people all over it.
[01:56:04.656 --> 01:56:06.277]  I mean, this is how low the communists are.
[01:56:06.277 --> 01:56:08.937]  But the point is, this is the same communist group we've had dealings with.
[01:56:08.937 --> 01:56:18.360]  They're like activating and coming out of their rat holes now, who say that a cat sanctuary in East Austin is gentrification, when people should want the property values to go up.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.641]  I mean, this is class warfare.
[01:56:20.641 --> 01:56:27.923]  And what I'm getting at, before we get back into Syria and the rest of it is, we're seeing all the socialist and communist and Black Lives Matter groups activate.
[01:56:27.923 --> 01:56:31.565]  So we're going to come back after this quick break and get into the geopolitical and the economy, Joel.
[01:56:33.376 --> 01:56:33.997]  What's the plan?
[01:56:33.997 --> 01:56:39.782]  As I mentioned, bringing in the Muslims into Europe, bringing them in here, activating all this let's kill the cops stuff.
[01:56:39.782 --> 01:56:43.146]  And we know there's problems with the cops, but the answer is don't go shoot them in the back of the head.
[01:56:43.146 --> 01:56:46.809]  Is that just a good old-fashioned destabilization plan or what is it?
[01:56:46.809 --> 01:56:48.571]  Well, it's conflict creation.
[01:56:48.571 --> 01:56:51.634]  In other words, you create conflicts and you have an excuse to intervene in society.
[01:56:51.634 --> 01:56:53.736]  You have an excuse to intervene for security.
[01:56:54.511 --> 01:57:03.197]  Take over police departments, mandate controls for racism and other things, and of course intolerance and hatred, and you get a federal presence on all police forces.
[01:57:03.197 --> 01:57:07.980]  So it's intervention in elections by watering down conservative voting powers.
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:11.382]  It's creating distrust between groups.
[01:57:11.382 --> 01:57:13.743]  Muslims never integrate well within society.
[01:57:13.743 --> 01:57:14.364]  That's what's happening.
[01:57:14.364 --> 01:57:17.346]  And they're so nasty, they go after a cat sanctuary.
[01:57:17.346 --> 01:57:17.986]  Absolutely.
[01:57:17.986 --> 01:57:22.169]  And so... The left should just totally turn against these people.
[01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:28.319]  But I guess by setting the precedent that we'll even go after a liberal jewel that's actually doing good.
[01:57:28.319 --> 01:57:29.141]  I mean, what is the point?
[01:57:29.141 --> 01:57:33.008]  Because I know this communist group is directed by a board at UT.
[01:57:33.008 --> 01:57:34.230]  This is all planned.
[01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:35.332]  They don't do this stuff unless it's ordered.
[01:57:36.823 --> 01:57:41.707]  Well, I think the worst thing, of course, is the Oklahoma professor that came out and said, we're all racist if you're white.
[01:57:41.707 --> 01:57:44.269]  You know, just by being white, you're racist.
[01:57:44.269 --> 01:57:47.372]  They're inculcating into minorities true racism.
[01:57:47.372 --> 01:57:52.997]  But it's also the instruction in public schools and public universities going forward that's just incredibly changing our society.
[01:57:52.997 --> 01:57:54.658]  They know what they're doing.
[01:57:54.658 --> 01:58:00.824]  Even a conservative state like Utah or Idaho, the younger rising generation coming out of socialist-oriented
[01:58:01.524 --> 01:58:02.224]  Universities.
[01:58:02.224 --> 01:58:03.305]  Public universities.
[01:58:03.305 --> 01:58:13.467]  And that's why there's the big push by Hillary Clinton to make public education free, to make sure that everybody goes through the propaganda of the leftist, left socialism that comes out of the universities.
[01:58:13.467 --> 01:58:17.228]  And then you'll have more people demanding more taxes to get their freebie.
[01:58:17.228 --> 01:58:17.928]  Absolutely.
[01:58:17.928 --> 01:58:20.449]  You increase this benefit-corrupted majority.
[01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:23.450]  And then all of a sudden, you can't ever win in a democracy.
[01:58:23.450 --> 01:58:28.893]  And they're so angry, they're mad that the average person in East Austin's property value has skyrocketed.
[01:58:28.893 --> 01:58:36.437]  And, I mean, they admit the average person that lives there, black, white, Hispanic, is getting incredibly successful and wealthy if they own property.
[01:58:36.437 --> 01:58:40.119]  But then the communists are there organizing people to go after cat sanctuaries.
[01:58:40.119 --> 01:58:41.520]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:46.762]  I mean, it's just the level of evil, folks, is hard to imagine.
[01:58:46.762 --> 01:58:49.544]  If they're successful, they'll just kill all the cats, you know.
[01:58:51.653 --> 01:58:52.173]  Not a group.
[01:58:52.173 --> 01:58:53.614]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:58:53.614 --> 01:58:54.934]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:54.934 --> 01:58:56.134]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:56.134 --> 01:59:01.416]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:59:01.416 --> 01:59:14.959]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:14.959 --> 01:59:16.320]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:18.761]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:59:18.761 --> 01:59:21.322]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:21.322 --> 01:59:22.623]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:22.623 --> 01:59:23.744]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:59:23.744 --> 01:59:25.084]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:25.084 --> 01:59:29.587]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:29.587 --> 01:59:32.708]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:32.708 --> 01:59:35.910]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:36.971]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:36.971 --> 01:59:37.791]  Living Defense.
[01:59:37.791 --> 01:59:38.892]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:38.892 --> 01:59:39.932]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:59:39.932 --> 01:59:42.634]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:42.634 --> 01:59:42.854]  And, uh,
[01:59:43.494 --> 01:59:44.535]  You support the broadcast.
[01:59:44.535 --> 01:59:45.876]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:59:45.876 --> 01:59:48.138]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:48.138 --> 01:59:53.702]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:53.702 --> 01:59:56.304]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.745 --> 02:00:14.767]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:14.767 --> 02:00:21.414]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:30.063 --> 02:00:31.123]  We'll also open the phones up.
[02:00:31.123 --> 02:00:33.004]  A few calls for Joel Skousen, specifically 800-259-9231.
[02:00:33.004 --> 02:00:33.184]  800-259-9231.
[02:00:33.184 --> 02:00:41.647]  Specifically on all the different geopolitical issues, the election.
[02:00:41.647 --> 02:00:44.268]  There's a wide area there, but directly to Joel Skousen.
[02:00:44.268 --> 02:00:45.009]  The reason I brought up...
[02:00:45.785 --> 02:00:51.609]  The article that's on Infowars.com, racist social justice warriors terrorize owner of cat sanctuary.
[02:00:51.609 --> 02:00:54.031]  I happen to have supported this place.
[02:00:54.031 --> 02:00:56.232]  And I happen to have been over there and they're nice people.
[02:00:56.232 --> 02:01:00.155]  And my daughters have, you know, cat cafe shirts and they like cats.
[02:01:00.155 --> 02:01:00.815]  Okay, I get it.
[02:01:00.815 --> 02:01:02.276]  So we got a cat.
[02:01:02.276 --> 02:01:05.698]  And so I mean, I've been in this place just a month ago, two months ago.
[02:01:06.741 --> 02:01:32.718]  And they put superglue in the deals, they knocked out windows, they put FU, gentrifying scum, and then they got all these trendies, led by the communist in people, honk for justice, hey hipster, don't be a bleeper, don't be a, and you know, basically come out and protest the cat sanctuary, and to say it's racist because white people came in to set up the cat sanctuary, again, it just shows total social warfare.
[02:01:36.349 --> 02:01:37.389]  I don't have an answer for that.
[02:01:37.389 --> 02:01:48.812]  I mean, for liberals to go after Katz saying, I just don't have an answer, unless it's just to create conflict or get Latinos worked up against whites for any reason whatsoever, but I just don't have a reason for that.
[02:01:48.812 --> 02:01:51.052]  I mean, you'd think they'd pick a better target.
[02:01:51.052 --> 02:01:51.872]  Absolutely.
[02:01:51.872 --> 02:01:53.353]  I don't have an answer for that.
[02:01:53.353 --> 02:01:55.413]  But I think it's about being low down and nasty.
[02:01:55.413 --> 02:01:58.634]  Now, expanding on that, we only have a few minutes left in the segment.
[02:01:58.634 --> 02:02:03.275]  Specifically, what else do you think Obama's going to try to pull before he leaves?
[02:02:12.386 --> 02:02:14.126]  Well, there's a couple of things that he could do.
[02:02:14.126 --> 02:02:18.727]  I'm trying to remember what was on my list.
[02:02:18.727 --> 02:02:22.168]  Because he did make a public statement about it.
[02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:27.909]  Well, imagine the Supreme Court stuff and other... Well, he can't go anywhere with that until after the election.
[02:02:27.909 --> 02:02:31.289]  But there were some things in trade that he was going to try to do.
[02:02:31.289 --> 02:02:32.009]  Oh, TPPs.
[02:02:32.009 --> 02:02:32.789]  That's right.
[02:02:32.789 --> 02:02:36.310]  How does he say... He's trying to get that passed before the lame duck session occurs.
[02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.930]  Sure.
[02:02:36.930 --> 02:02:38.230]  Yeah.
[02:02:38.230 --> 02:02:41.471]  And the news ran hoaxes saying Obama's going to pass it even if Congress doesn't.
[02:02:41.471 --> 02:02:41.811]  They can't.
[02:02:44.016 --> 02:02:45.777]  Well, you know, it depends.
[02:02:45.777 --> 02:02:47.417]  Yeah, I don't think they can at this time.
[02:02:47.417 --> 02:02:52.179]  Even Paul Ryan isn't willing to accept it at this time.
[02:02:52.179 --> 02:03:00.142]  And is that because he wants to be more in charge of the deal-making himself after Obama's gone?
[02:03:00.142 --> 02:03:04.444]  Well, he just can't politically go for TPP while Trump is running, you know.
[02:03:04.444 --> 02:03:06.545]  How bad is Paul Ryan?
[02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:08.985]  Well, I think Paul Ryan, when you looked at what he said about his
[02:03:11.349 --> 02:03:15.750]  His opposition, you know, real true right-wing opposition was running against him.
[02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:18.591]  He got pretty nasty about him.
[02:03:18.591 --> 02:03:27.334]  So even though Paul Ryan has, I think, a very conservative feeling that he gives to people, I think he really is a globalist playing the other side.
[02:03:27.334 --> 02:03:28.475]  He wouldn't be elected.
[02:03:28.475 --> 02:03:30.335]  They wouldn't have elected him Speaker of the House.
[02:03:30.335 --> 02:03:31.335]  Sure.
[02:03:31.335 --> 02:03:36.957]  Why did Mitt Romney come out against Trump and then flip back to liking Trump?
[02:03:36.957 --> 02:03:38.158]  I didn't know he did.
[02:03:38.158 --> 02:03:39.018]  He's been going back and forth.
[02:03:40.336 --> 02:03:47.183]  Well, you know, in Utah, it's a very special situation where they have played to the Mormon view here, who's anathema to Trump.
[02:03:47.183 --> 02:03:53.029]  They've given them Evan McMullin, who is an ex-CIA, covert operative, worked for Goldman Sachs, CFR.
[02:03:53.029 --> 02:03:54.411]  I mean, he's a globalist.
[02:03:54.411 --> 02:03:55.772]  We should talk about him when we come back.
[02:03:55.772 --> 02:04:00.997]  I've heard him on NPR just dripping with hatred for Trump and NPR groveling to him.
[02:04:01.932 --> 02:04:03.153]  No, he's a real plant.
[02:04:03.153 --> 02:04:11.038]  He's meant to destroy the Trump vote in Utah, which is the reddest state in the Union, to embarrass Trump, to deny him votes.
[02:04:11.038 --> 02:04:12.339]  But it's terrible.
[02:04:12.339 --> 02:04:23.166]  There's been several articles coming out by Will Grigg and others in Utah and Idaho saying that Mormons have just been played for fools to go for Evan Mecham because he's a globalist.
[02:04:23.906 --> 02:04:27.450]  Well, I heard that guy and he shouted like a barrel of snakes.
[02:04:27.450 --> 02:04:28.972]  He's not a nice person.
[02:04:28.972 --> 02:04:29.813]  Not a nice person.
[02:04:29.813 --> 02:04:32.736]  Anybody who's been involved in covert operations is not nice.
[02:04:32.736 --> 02:04:36.821]  Well, he admitted that he's basically probably going to get Hillary out.
[02:04:36.821 --> 02:04:38.683]  I mean, he's just there to sabotage.
[02:04:38.683 --> 02:04:39.604]  That's exactly right.
[02:04:40.365 --> 02:04:45.408]  Well, why would people that are traditionally super conservative and anti-establishment want to be played like that?
[02:04:45.408 --> 02:04:47.229]  Because they've been played on their moral values.
[02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:51.511]  It's so inethimate to vote for somebody who's morally corrupt as Donald Trump.
[02:04:51.511 --> 02:04:55.514]  They've never been given information about the moral corruptness of Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:55.514 --> 02:04:58.856]  There's been absolutely nothing... Sure, but it's not even lesser to evils.
[02:04:58.856 --> 02:05:00.296]  Hillary's a whole other magnitude.
[02:05:00.296 --> 02:05:00.917]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:02.222 --> 02:05:08.988]  In a private 2012 board meeting, George Soros said that the rise of money in politics poses a great threat to democracy.
[02:05:08.988 --> 02:05:13.671]  Ironically, his primary role in politics has been a benefactor to corrupt politicos.
[02:05:13.671 --> 02:05:18.295]  This is coming from a hacked internal document from Soros' Open Society Foundation.
[02:05:18.295 --> 02:05:20.417]  It was published by DC Leaks this summer.
[02:05:20.417 --> 02:05:25.221]  Now, including in the DC Leaks dump were the meetings of this meeting from the OSF board.
[02:05:25.221 --> 02:05:27.022]  The meeting was attended by OSF staff.
[02:05:27.222 --> 02:05:33.649]  Along with Soros, and during the meeting, they were tackling challenges like how best to create a quote, racial narrative.
[02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:39.335]  According to The Minute, Soros told attendees he believes the rise of money in politics endangers our democracy.
[02:05:39.335 --> 02:05:49.066]  Ironically, that didn't stop Soros from giving 10 million to a pro-Clinton super PAC, or stop him from secretly paying the salaries of four staffers of the Moldovan Prime Minister's office.
[02:05:49.226 --> 02:05:53.454]  Guess when Hillary mentioned all the dark money and getting it out of politics in the last debate?
[02:05:53.454 --> 02:05:56.400]  She didn't mean people like her BFF George Soros.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:58.885]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:06:01.368 --> 02:06:03.089]  I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[02:06:03.089 --> 02:06:07.392]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown?
[02:06:07.392 --> 02:06:10.954]  Like many experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming.
[02:06:10.954 --> 02:06:12.996]  I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[02:06:12.996 --> 02:06:15.898]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money.
[02:06:15.898 --> 02:06:21.421]  Do what I did and call United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALEX.
[02:06:21.421 --> 02:06:22.802]  It's a company I trust.
[02:06:22.802 --> 02:06:28.586]  They're offering gold and silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[02:06:28.886 --> 02:06:32.107]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks.
[02:06:32.107 --> 02:06:36.549]  China recently bought more than a billion dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move.
[02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:42.371]  Gold and silver are recognized worldwide as one of the most stable means of protecting finances.
[02:06:42.371 --> 02:06:43.051]  Don't delay.
[02:06:43.051 --> 02:06:50.073]  Call 844-541-ALEX now and get a rugged double locked bank bag to securely store your coins absolutely free.
[02:06:50.073 --> 02:06:54.555]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority.
[02:06:54.855 --> 02:06:57.497]  I personally own these survival packs and you should too.
[02:06:57.497 --> 02:07:01.040]  Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALEX-NOW.
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:07.725]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:07:07.725 --> 02:07:10.787]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:07:10.787 --> 02:07:15.971]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:07:16.391 --> 02:07:22.497]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:22.497 --> 02:07:25.780]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:27.442]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:07:27.442 --> 02:07:31.766]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:31.766 --> 02:07:34.709]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:34.709 --> 02:07:36.370]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:38.733]  It works to repair nerve growth.
[02:07:39.253 --> 02:07:40.093]  We're good to go.
[02:08:12.307 --> 02:08:15.121]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:40.555 --> 02:08:41.816]  Only 14 days.
[02:08:41.816 --> 02:08:44.176]  In fact, about 13 and a half.
[02:08:44.176 --> 02:08:51.259]  I tell ya, I have just been sick at my stomach watching the depths that MSM will go to lie and deceive.
[02:08:51.259 --> 02:08:53.460]  The latest article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:55.521]  It's also on DrudgeReport.com.
[02:08:56.991 --> 02:09:00.572]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the newest Podesta emails.
[02:09:00.572 --> 02:09:11.136]  He's being directed directly by Hillary Clinton to engage in criminal actions, directing their national coordinators to engage in election fraud and have people vote over and over again.
[02:09:11.136 --> 02:09:11.836]  And it gets worse.
[02:09:13.035 --> 02:09:17.838]  I've never seen election fraud via the polls like this, where it's all done by oversampling.
[02:09:17.838 --> 02:09:28.704]  They're not normally that brazen, but they know the media is under their control, so they'd rather just have unified, that's what he talks about in the email, unified fraud, that the way we're going to skew the polls is oversampling.
[02:09:28.704 --> 02:09:29.364]  Oversampling.
[02:09:29.364 --> 02:09:35.368]  A lot of times they can just have databases of phones they call, where they know it's really Democrats, not Republicans, that's also oversampling.
[02:09:35.368 --> 02:09:37.209]  This is just nakedly doing it.
[02:09:37.209 --> 02:09:41.992]  Phil Schausen, I want to get into geopolitics, finish up with Syria and take some phone calls, but just specifically,
[02:09:43.376 --> 02:09:49.579]  I mean, I don't think it's... I think 20% of it is that we know more now about how corrupt it is.
[02:09:49.579 --> 02:09:53.941]  But I think 80% of it is the media and others have gotten more consolidated.
[02:09:53.941 --> 02:09:57.623]  Look at this whole Time Warner AT&T merger they want to do.
[02:09:57.623 --> 02:10:01.645]  And they just know they have nothing to lose now and are more naked than ever.
[02:10:01.645 --> 02:10:03.246]  And I really see it blowing up in their face.
[02:10:03.246 --> 02:10:06.367]  But what do you think then about the polls being rigged, admittedly?
[02:10:06.367 --> 02:10:09.489]  And then going into this election, what happens if they
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:12.201]  I don't think, Alex, there's any way they can let Donald Trump win.
[02:10:12.201 --> 02:10:12.982]  They simply cannot do it.
[02:10:12.982 --> 02:10:16.364]  And they have the ability to computerize and manipulate those elections.
[02:10:16.364 --> 02:10:17.685]  That was proven in the Chicago audit.
[02:10:33.388 --> 02:10:33.748]  I don't know.
[02:10:33.748 --> 02:10:35.029]  I think you covered that.
[02:10:35.029 --> 02:10:46.356]  The Chicago audit of the Democratic primary, they found that almost 20% of the votes were illegally switched by the computer to Hillary Clinton and they changed the audit results rather than admit to there was computer fraud.
[02:10:46.356 --> 02:10:50.479]  I mean, how can they sit there at a mainstream meeting and talk about it and interview all these people?
[02:10:50.479 --> 02:10:51.700]  There's no election fraud.
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:57.664]  How dare people ever say that when there's actual examples of computer fraud that have been documented by a Chicago audit?
[02:11:00.422 --> 02:11:01.022]  Sure.
[02:11:01.022 --> 02:11:07.246]  What about more people voting forever in the 2012 election and then Mitt Romney loses?
[02:11:07.246 --> 02:11:12.209]  I mean, Trump pointed out that Obama was way more unpopular by then than he was in 2008.
[02:11:12.209 --> 02:11:16.331]  The telling point was that they said there were 8 million people less that voted in 2000.
[02:11:16.331 --> 02:11:18.272]  Not more, less.
[02:11:18.272 --> 02:11:19.873]  And that was impossible.
[02:11:19.873 --> 02:11:22.395]  There was twice as much enthusiasm against Obama.
[02:11:22.395 --> 02:11:23.275]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:11:23.275 --> 02:11:26.157]  Real numbers from political science I've talked to say they believe it was more votes, actually.
[02:11:26.738 --> 02:11:32.662]  That's right, and they said there were 8 million less, so that means that they had to kill so many votes electronically.
[02:11:32.662 --> 02:11:33.342]  10 or 12 million.
[02:11:33.342 --> 02:11:36.064]  10 or 12 million in order to defeat Mitt Romney.
[02:11:36.064 --> 02:11:41.287]  And then Trump, to his credit then, did tweet and did get involved and did say, I believe this is fraud.
[02:11:42.079 --> 02:11:42.679]  And it was for us.
[02:11:42.679 --> 02:11:43.620]  Why are they so scared of him?
[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:47.241]  Because despite the fact he's a bull in a china shop, he really is a nationalist.
[02:11:47.241 --> 02:11:49.142]  He's not out to get America.
[02:11:49.142 --> 02:11:58.265]  Well, that speech that you put out, you know, Donald Trump, where he talks about how rigged the system and the establishment and all of the things, so well laid out, he cannot be allowed to be president.
[02:11:59.085 --> 02:12:08.376]  Even though he doesn't have the best advisors surrounding him, I mean, just knowing what he's knowing about the establishment and promising to kill the establishment system.
[02:12:08.376 --> 02:12:09.458]  They just can't allow that to happen.
[02:12:09.458 --> 02:12:10.859]  I know what's happening with him.
[02:12:10.859 --> 02:12:12.501]  He's like me.
[02:12:12.501 --> 02:12:18.728]  When I get tired, I don't care I'm on air, and I just kind of start saying whatever I want to, even though they're going to take it out of context.
[02:12:19.289 --> 02:12:21.391]  He's so real, that's his problem.
[02:12:21.391 --> 02:12:23.693]  They make him do so many speeches and he's happy to do it.
[02:12:23.693 --> 02:12:29.959]  The guy works like 18 hours a day, that after he's doing his third speech for the day and is exhausted, he'll just start saying whatever he wants.
[02:12:29.959 --> 02:12:31.140]  And I think they're working too hard.
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:33.543]  I think he should... Lately now, they've got him more laser-beamed.
[02:12:35.182 --> 02:12:38.123]  Well, he doesn't take time to... Am I off the microphone?
[02:12:38.123 --> 02:12:41.624]  No, no, you're on air.
[02:12:41.624 --> 02:12:44.245]  He doesn't take time to reflect upon what's going on.
[02:12:44.245 --> 02:12:46.906]  He doesn't take down time to memorize or any of that.
[02:12:46.906 --> 02:12:51.608]  He is a person who's very, very much hyped up, and he has to go into that mode.
[02:12:51.608 --> 02:12:55.530]  And so, unfortunately, he's going to make mistakes.
[02:12:55.530 --> 02:12:58.571]  But you really think there's no way they're not going to steal it?
[02:12:58.571 --> 02:12:58.951]  That's right.
[02:12:58.951 --> 02:13:03.713]  There's no way I'm going to predict that it's going to be a landslide, manipulated landslide against Donald Trump.
[02:13:04.167 --> 02:13:06.507]  As a referendum on destroying America.
[02:13:06.507 --> 02:13:07.048]  That's right.
[02:13:07.048 --> 02:13:13.649]  And to make sure that they have an excuse to come against the right-wing media and say, this is what you caused.
[02:13:13.649 --> 02:13:20.530]  They're going to give the GOP establishment tremendous ammunition to say to, you know, we don't want to hear any more about these conspiracies.
[02:13:20.530 --> 02:13:22.691]  You've ruined us once, never again.
[02:13:22.691 --> 02:13:23.351]  That's right.
[02:13:23.351 --> 02:13:28.232]  And then try to train Republicans to sit down, be good while we dismantle the country.
[02:13:28.232 --> 02:13:30.112]  And maybe we'll give you a few seats in Congress.
[02:13:30.112 --> 02:13:31.473]  And it's not going to work.
[02:13:31.473 --> 02:13:33.193]  I think the rebellion is permanent.
[02:13:34.105 --> 02:13:36.427]  And it's going to be more and more intense.
[02:13:36.427 --> 02:13:43.153]  The trouble is, once Hillary Clinton gets in and legalizes so many illegal immigrants in a raw democracy, you cannot win another election.
[02:13:43.153 --> 02:13:43.713]  Well, that's right.
[02:13:43.713 --> 02:13:45.475]  And that's why you can see him scripting it all.
[02:13:45.475 --> 02:13:47.176]  What you're saying is not your opinion.
[02:13:47.176 --> 02:13:47.576]  It's happening.
[02:13:47.576 --> 02:13:49.158]  The question is, will they be successful?
[02:13:49.158 --> 02:13:50.279]  We're going to fight.
[02:13:50.279 --> 02:13:52.340]  They tried to steal it from him in the primary.
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:53.601]  He came out and exposed it.
[02:13:53.601 --> 02:13:54.863]  He's going to fight this time.
[02:13:54.863 --> 02:14:00.227]  The problem is, he would have had Scalia, the tiebreaker, at a Supreme Court decision and would have won.
[02:14:00.227 --> 02:14:01.168]  Scalia's dead in a doornail.
[02:14:01.676 --> 02:14:02.417]  That's right.
[02:14:02.417 --> 02:14:08.983]  And we're going to never win another Supreme Court opinion ever again once she stacks the Supreme Court against us.
[02:14:08.983 --> 02:14:15.889]  Did you notice even the Washington Post made a joke about a month later and said, yeah, he was in a secret society, ha ha ha, Bohemian Grove, ha ha ha.
[02:14:15.889 --> 02:14:21.234]  I mean, he wasn't in Bohemian Grove, but he was a subgroup of Bohemian Grove that he'd been lured into at that ranch.
[02:14:21.234 --> 02:14:23.256]  And they just basically told us.
[02:14:23.256 --> 02:14:24.417]  And there was a pillow on his face.
[02:14:24.417 --> 02:14:25.178]  They wanted us to know.
[02:14:26.323 --> 02:14:30.345]  They might as well wrap body armor with fish, you know, and said Luke O'Broxie sleeps with the fishes.
[02:14:30.345 --> 02:14:40.291]  Very suspicious when you don't have a coroner, you know, doing an autopsy on a major public figure like this that's been, you know, killed under a mysterious circumstance.
[02:14:40.291 --> 02:14:48.016]  And Podesta's got emails out two days before with his lobbyist saying, got some wet work coming up, batting down the hatches, this is gonna get rough.
[02:14:48.016 --> 02:14:52.759]  Yeah, wet work refers to assassinations by the dark side of government.
[02:14:52.759 --> 02:14:53.139]  Blood work.
[02:14:56.823 --> 02:15:10.382]  Man, and I see all these weirdo leftists that are really the targets of this, that have no future, they've been given college degrees that are worthless, and they're all just worshipping war and corporate lies, and a Nazi collaborator is their omnibudsman Soros.
[02:15:10.382 --> 02:15:10.983]  It's shameful!
[02:15:12.526 --> 02:15:16.647]  Well, it's a matter of just going along with the wave that they know nobody can stop.
[02:15:16.647 --> 02:15:22.610]  I mean, you're in government, you see there's a control system, they don't know how it operates, but said, don't dare move against it.
[02:15:22.610 --> 02:15:24.410]  I end up like Vince Foster.
[02:15:24.410 --> 02:15:31.313]  I mean, these kinds of killings that occur occasionally by the, in the Clinton administration, end up reverberating on down the line.
[02:15:31.313 --> 02:15:33.273]  It causes the fear of the establishment.
[02:15:33.273 --> 02:15:38.075]  We put in all the... But as you said, I want to get into Syria and some calls.
[02:15:38.075 --> 02:15:40.396]  Everything's a two-way street, and just organically,
[02:15:41.581 --> 02:15:44.042]  We've already seen some fireworks.
[02:15:44.042 --> 02:15:48.464]  I think if they steal it and they get in, I think it's the beginning of the end.
[02:15:48.464 --> 02:15:53.406]  I mean, it's almost better they steal it, I think, than Trump get in and they just sabotage him and blame us.
[02:15:53.406 --> 02:15:55.947]  That could be an even bigger discredit.
[02:15:55.947 --> 02:15:58.628]  They're clearly trying to compromise Trump in case he does win.
[02:15:58.628 --> 02:15:59.989]  And that's why Newt Gingrich is there.
[02:15:59.989 --> 02:16:01.770]  That's why Chris Christie is there.
[02:16:01.770 --> 02:16:06.632]  That's why he doesn't have any of the Roger Stone advisors in the Trump camp anymore.
[02:16:08.769 --> 02:16:09.530]  Man, I tell you.
[02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:13.172]  Well, let's briefly put bookends on the Syria situation right now.
[02:16:13.172 --> 02:16:15.473]  They're trying to let ISIS escape.
[02:16:15.473 --> 02:16:24.199]  The point I want to make on that is the whole purpose of creating ISIS and sending them into Iraq to build them as a military force was to eventually get back into Syria.
[02:16:24.199 --> 02:16:31.284]  And that's the reason why they're letting ISIS escape with their arms under every battle so that they can funnel them back into Syria.
[02:16:31.944 --> 02:16:38.772]  And then under the excuse of attacking ISIS, they'll be taking down Syrian troops, just like they have twice already, where U.S.
[02:16:38.772 --> 02:16:40.894]  bombers went in and attacked Syrian positions.
[02:16:40.894 --> 02:16:47.261]  But they're going to bring all the ISIS forces in and eventually have an excuse to intervene and take down Syria.
[02:16:47.261 --> 02:16:50.144]  They won't be able to get through with the no-fly zone because of Russia's intervention.
[02:16:50.744 --> 02:16:55.049]  But believe me, Syria's coming back into Syria.
[02:16:55.049 --> 02:16:59.794]  I mean, ISIS coming into Syria in force in order to create an excuse for the U.S.
[02:16:59.794 --> 02:17:03.237]  to intervene directly militarily.
[02:17:03.237 --> 02:17:05.960]  What do you make of Turkey starting to get closer to Russia?
[02:17:07.651 --> 02:17:14.713]  This is a very strange situation because one of the reasons why Turkey will stay in NATO, I think he's made his deal with the devil.
[02:17:14.713 --> 02:17:17.014]  He's going to be a plant within NATO.
[02:17:17.014 --> 02:17:22.556]  And so Syria or Turkey is going to be funneling intelligence and information to Russia.
[02:17:22.556 --> 02:17:25.657]  And so Turkey's in a real difficult situation.
[02:17:25.657 --> 02:17:29.819]  They have to play both sides and play neutral.
[02:17:29.819 --> 02:17:31.819]  But they're clearly invading Syria.
[02:17:31.819 --> 02:17:32.520]  The U.S.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:33.600]  is saying nothing about it.
[02:17:34.767 --> 02:17:41.089]  Even though they shot down a Russian fighter who strayed, what, two miles, or not even two miles, 200 feet into the Syrian border.
[02:17:41.089 --> 02:17:41.989]  For a couple seconds.
[02:17:41.989 --> 02:17:44.490]  And Syria openly invades Syria.
[02:17:44.490 --> 02:17:46.410]  I mean, Turkey openly invades Syria, and the U.S.
[02:17:46.410 --> 02:17:47.190]  says nothing about it.
[02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:48.991]  I mean, it's so hypocritical.
[02:17:48.991 --> 02:17:52.171]  The Russians aren't saying anything about it either, and that's a problem.
[02:17:52.171 --> 02:17:58.533]  The Russians could be doing a lot more toward exposing the globalist agenda, toward exposing the hypocrisy.
[02:17:58.533 --> 02:18:02.794]  Well, obviously, there's major globalist infiltration still inside the Russian apparatus.
[02:18:04.195 --> 02:18:13.000]  Although I think Putin and his oligarchs, remember he changed and purged the original oligarchs and created new ones that support him.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.502]  But he's playing a cat and mouse game with the globalists.
[02:18:15.502 --> 02:18:21.386]  He's not ready to attack them directly and to inflame them directly and that's why he's playing kind of cool in these things.
[02:18:21.966 --> 02:18:25.349]  But he's not leaving Syria, so I think the U.S.
[02:18:25.349 --> 02:18:27.211]  is going to have trouble taking down Assad.
[02:18:27.211 --> 02:18:33.937]  Remember, the purpose of taking down Assad is then they invoke that nuclear agreement they made with Iran, which is full of traps.
[02:18:33.937 --> 02:18:37.721]  It isn't, as Trump thinks, a damaging thing for America.
[02:18:38.627 --> 02:18:45.512]  The actual, the American globals did this agreement with Iran to set up a trap so they could have an excuse to attack them any time later on.
[02:18:45.512 --> 02:18:46.153]  Sure.
[02:18:46.153 --> 02:18:48.835]  That the Iranians are already, you know, violent.
[02:18:48.835 --> 02:18:50.956]  Let's jam a real quick one in here because I've got to go break.
[02:18:50.956 --> 02:18:51.957]  Walter, you've got a question.
[02:18:51.957 --> 02:18:52.417]  Go ahead.
[02:18:52.417 --> 02:18:54.279]  You're calling from Virginia.
[02:18:54.279 --> 02:18:58.642]  Mr. Jones, two questions for Dr. Scalzi.
[02:18:58.642 --> 02:18:59.943]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:18:59.943 --> 02:19:04.086]  I have your book, Is the Southern Korean Peninsula Still Doomed?
[02:19:06.917 --> 02:19:07.658]  You're not going to get that.
[02:19:07.658 --> 02:19:08.459]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:19:08.459 --> 02:19:09.199]  You got unplugged.
[02:19:09.199 --> 02:19:09.900]  That's what happened.
[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:10.521]  I don't know.
[02:19:10.521 --> 02:19:11.582]  I guess you kicked something under there.
[02:19:11.582 --> 02:19:12.943]  I apologize.
[02:19:12.943 --> 02:19:14.324]  No wonder we can't take calls.
[02:19:14.324 --> 02:19:16.807]  We'll go to break and fix that, okay, Joel?
[02:19:16.807 --> 02:19:21.011]  He was asking, is the South Korean peninsula still a big trouble spot to live?
[02:19:21.011 --> 02:19:21.291]  It is.
[02:19:21.291 --> 02:19:22.853]  In fact, that's going to be the trouble spot.
[02:19:22.853 --> 02:19:27.698]  The trigger for World War III is a North Korean invasion of the South, which will invoke a nuclear war.
[02:19:28.459 --> 02:19:29.100]  Because the U.S.
[02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:30.741]  will respond with tactical nukes.
[02:19:30.741 --> 02:19:33.603]  China will say, you started it, and do that preemptive strike.
[02:19:33.603 --> 02:19:38.087]  So don't be in South Korea when this trigger happens.
[02:19:38.087 --> 02:19:40.909]  But then the double-cross against Russia comes next, or?
[02:19:40.909 --> 02:19:43.011]  Double-cross comes after the war started.
[02:19:43.011 --> 02:19:45.533]  Russia and China both together nuked the U.S.
[02:19:45.533 --> 02:19:46.074]  military.
[02:19:46.574 --> 02:19:49.258]  But then as the war is progressed and the U.S.
[02:19:49.258 --> 02:19:53.024]  regroups under a global military, then they'll talk China into becoming Russia.
[02:19:53.024 --> 02:19:57.250]  Sure, and it's been declassified in the 60s that there was a deal they tried to broker where the U.S.
[02:19:57.250 --> 02:20:01.016]  would join Russia in a strike on China, but they said, no, that deal never happened.
[02:20:01.016 --> 02:20:01.436]  We'll be back.

[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:05.800]  Hello, everybody.
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:07.761]  My name is Charley Sales.
[02:21:07.761 --> 02:21:13.822]  I'm a Vietnam veteran, harmonica player, vocalist, and blues songwriter.
[02:21:13.822 --> 02:21:17.423]  Now, I've been married, been homeless, every which way.
[02:21:17.423 --> 02:21:21.844]  But right now, I've hooked up with a great record company.
[02:21:21.844 --> 02:21:24.105]  Not just me, a lot of musicians.

[02:21:36.777 --> 02:21:39.538]  And man wasn't made to live underground.

[02:23:01.341 --> 02:23:13.926]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[02:23:13.926 --> 02:23:17.928]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[02:23:51.595 --> 02:23:52.456]  For the love of clean water.
[02:24:17.159 --> 02:24:20.001]  Well, I think they're going to use Trump as the excuse to go after all of the
[02:24:47.489 --> 02:24:50.932]  So-called radicals and extremes to say continue to support him.
[02:24:50.932 --> 02:24:57.557]  And if Trump starts a media network, you know, he's not going to be able to do as much as what you've done.
[02:24:57.557 --> 02:24:59.159]  It won't be as professional.
[02:24:59.159 --> 02:25:01.180]  And as I say, that's why I say you're the tip of the spear.
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:02.922]  They mentioned Sean Hannity.
[02:25:02.922 --> 02:25:05.824]  They mentioned, you know, O'Reilly and others.
[02:25:05.824 --> 02:25:08.086]  But these people are actually hacks.
[02:25:08.086 --> 02:25:11.569]  Fox News is not a true conservative media.
[02:25:12.189 --> 02:25:14.170]  It's a faux conservative media.
[02:25:14.170 --> 02:25:20.253]  Well, you're saying, I mean, they put out kind of pap, not hardcore stuff that changes paradigms.
[02:25:20.253 --> 02:25:27.057]  Yeah, they put out that Obama's the problem, implying that as soon as Obama's gone, that our problems are solved, and it's not solved.
[02:25:27.057 --> 02:25:29.919]  No, Trump is saying it's global, it's foreign banks, which it is.
[02:25:29.919 --> 02:25:32.140]  They try to say it's conspiracy theory, but it's in all the WikiLeaks.
[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:33.000]  That's right.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:40.982]  And so, as I say, they've got to go after you, they've got to go after me, they've got to go after other people like, you know, Keane.
[02:25:40.982 --> 02:25:43.862]  I mean, they're going to crucify him for putting out this Veritas project.
[02:25:43.862 --> 02:25:46.743]  He has literally got into them through infiltration.
[02:25:46.743 --> 02:25:49.364]  That's what they put him in jail before for tapping into somebody's phone.
[02:25:49.364 --> 02:25:52.964]  I mean, you've got to use these kind of... Oh, by the way, they hate him even more than me.
[02:25:52.964 --> 02:25:54.865]  I mean, I don't know how he's alive.
[02:25:55.799 --> 02:26:03.950]  Because I went and did a little bit of infiltration on the Clintons just exposing a judge that was having a fake trial for the Davidians and they kept calling up going, we're going to beat you up.
[02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:08.956]  And I was like, oh yeah, and I walk outside and four guys beat the hell out of me saying, shut up about the Clintons.
[02:26:08.956 --> 02:26:10.598]  I mean, and I was nobody then.
[02:26:10.598 --> 02:26:11.500]  That was 18 years ago.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.761]  Look what they did when you went after the Bilderberg.
[02:26:13.761 --> 02:26:19.604]  All of a sudden, boy, I mean, they shut down all the media to make sure nobody could get near the Bilderberg conference because of what you did.
[02:26:19.604 --> 02:26:26.387]  And I would get on elevators and they would have like Marine Corps colonels get on, out of uniform, put their shoulders into me and start threatening me.
[02:26:26.387 --> 02:26:26.887]  That's right.
[02:26:26.887 --> 02:26:29.509]  And look what you did when you infiltrated the Bohemian Grove.
[02:26:29.509 --> 02:26:36.312]  It's the only time, you know, we've been able to see those satanic rituals that all the powerful, you know, adhere to when they go to that.
[02:26:37.128 --> 02:26:44.631]  And again, even John Ronson, who didn't believe it and was like an atheist, he said, no, the men in the audience were in religious rapture during it.
[02:26:44.631 --> 02:26:45.531]  They were taking it serious.
[02:26:45.531 --> 02:26:47.312]  It was a Faustian ritual.
[02:26:47.312 --> 02:26:48.453]  That's right.
[02:26:48.453 --> 02:26:53.134]  Yeah, there is an evil, satanic aspect to this entire global conspiracy, and that's why it is not greed.
[02:26:53.134 --> 02:26:56.316]  How do you think I was able to get in there?
[02:26:56.316 --> 02:26:58.917]  Well, I think you had to crawl in.
[02:26:58.917 --> 02:27:00.497]  No, I know, but other people did that and got caught.
[02:27:00.497 --> 02:27:01.698]  I guess it was, again, just providence.
[02:27:02.984 --> 02:27:11.192]  No, I think, you know, we're allowed to get enough information out to influence people to realize there really is true conspiracies, globalist control.
[02:27:11.192 --> 02:27:12.693]  This is God, isn't it, WikiLeaks?
[02:27:12.693 --> 02:27:14.675]  We're being shown everything first.
[02:27:14.675 --> 02:27:17.778]  And then if we don't do the right thing, we're going to be judged.
[02:27:17.778 --> 02:27:21.402]  Yeah, we've got enough information now to be responsible for losing our liberty.
[02:27:21.402 --> 02:27:23.264]  And unfortunately, you know, I think
[02:27:24.181 --> 02:27:30.646]  We're going to lose it in this election if they steal it, and I think it's never going to be regained as a nation.
[02:27:30.646 --> 02:27:41.215]  It doesn't mean there won't be pockets of liberty, and that's why I'm a big push of people to be prepared to relocate strategically out of these big cities, because the cities will always be controlled.
[02:27:41.215 --> 02:27:46.659]  Sure, well I don't want to be a wimp, but at the same time, it's not even selfishness.
[02:27:46.659 --> 02:27:49.702]  At a certain point, it's like my gut tells me
[02:27:51.994 --> 02:27:53.876]  They're coming for you after this.
[02:27:53.876 --> 02:27:54.616]  Just be ready.
[02:27:54.616 --> 02:27:58.419]  And then I'm kind of like, OK, I guess I just roll out there and let them destroy me.
[02:27:58.419 --> 02:27:58.920]  I don't know.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:04.224]  I mean, well, you can't be vulnerable knowingly, but you've got to keep doing what you're doing.
[02:28:04.224 --> 02:28:04.805]  You've got to be more.
[02:28:04.805 --> 02:28:05.706]  No, no, I know that.
[02:28:05.706 --> 02:28:08.688]  But I mean, there is you keep going up against these people at a certain point.
[02:28:08.688 --> 02:28:11.390]  There is just a kind of I either have to not care.
[02:28:11.390 --> 02:28:13.812]  I can't like start caring or worrying is what I'm saying.
[02:28:13.812 --> 02:28:15.214]  I feel like I don't know how to explain it.
[02:28:15.214 --> 02:28:15.514]  It's like.
[02:28:17.568 --> 02:28:18.269]  I don't know.
[02:28:18.269 --> 02:28:24.593]  Well, the way I look at it is, is I understand what I think is the fact that there's going to be a judgment upon this nation someday.
[02:28:24.593 --> 02:28:28.296]  I'm willing to accept it, but my purpose is not to save the whole nation.
[02:28:28.296 --> 02:28:30.277]  My purpose is to save those who will listen.
[02:28:30.277 --> 02:28:31.178]  Save those who censor.
[02:28:31.178 --> 02:28:32.118]  So we're here for those folks.
[02:28:32.118 --> 02:28:33.840]  We're here for those, to save a remnant.
[02:28:34.605 --> 02:28:40.469]  Because the Lord is only interested, really, in saving those people who have good intentions, who have listened to conscience.
[02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:45.073]  And it's only through, you know, listening to your conscience that you're going to be guided to the correct news sources.
[02:28:45.073 --> 02:28:48.696]  You'll be able to perceive truth from evil and deception and all those things.
[02:28:48.696 --> 02:28:50.857]  This is the big test we're living through.
[02:28:50.857 --> 02:28:56.422]  That's why it's not such a... I mean, it's a downer to think, you know, about losing your liberty, but it's a test.
[02:28:56.422 --> 02:28:57.622]  And we look upon it as a test.
[02:28:57.622 --> 02:29:01.365]  We have to be successful, even if the rest of the world isn't going to go along.
[02:29:01.365 --> 02:29:02.106]  We have to listen.
[02:29:02.426 --> 02:29:03.047]  And that's it.
[02:29:03.047 --> 02:29:04.127]  I feel, that's it.
[02:29:04.127 --> 02:29:17.417]  I feel, because I don't think of myself as some great guy, so sad for these evil people in media that fawning want to sell out and just grovel and my fellow countrymen and women just being deceived and liking it.
[02:29:17.417 --> 02:29:18.538]  I'm sad for them.
[02:29:18.538 --> 02:29:19.339]  Yeah, me too.
[02:29:20.310 --> 02:29:27.077]  Because ultimately, as I say, when you do what's right, we take the consequences, and no matter what we suffer, we'll come out ahead.
[02:29:27.077 --> 02:29:28.858]  And so, I'm okay with it.
[02:29:28.858 --> 02:29:31.241]  Why don't you go get some lunch so we can take these callers?
[02:29:31.241 --> 02:29:33.363]  Okay.
[02:29:33.363 --> 02:29:36.085]  Eat real fast some of that venison I shot that they cooked up in there.
[02:29:36.085 --> 02:29:37.367]  That's the kind of stuff we eat around here.
[02:29:37.367 --> 02:29:38.608]  We got a bunch of stuff.
[02:29:38.608 --> 02:29:40.990]  And then if you want, come back in to take these phone calls in about 15 minutes.
[02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:41.671]  Yeah, let's do it.
[02:29:42.331 --> 02:29:45.292]  From Andrew, Anthony, Kristen, Bruce, John and others.
[02:29:45.292 --> 02:29:46.433]  I'm gonna stay in here.
[02:29:46.433 --> 02:29:49.094]  Got Project Veritas popping in with their next big story.
[02:29:49.094 --> 02:29:50.935]  We'll find out more straight ahead.
[02:29:50.935 --> 02:29:52.336]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.336 --> 02:29:54.857]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.857 --> 02:29:57.538]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.698 --> 02:30:16.828]  Virginia Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend of the Clintons, gave a whopping $467,500 to the campaign of the wife of an FBI official who later helped supervise the probe of Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information.
[02:30:16.828 --> 02:30:27.675]  The investigation was conducted by the Wall Street Journal and it says the governor's PAC donated to the state senate campaign of Jill McCain, who's married to Andrew McCabe, now the FBI's deputy director.
[02:30:27.675 --> 02:30:31.277]  A spokesperson for the governor told the Wall Street Journal that McAuliffe, of course,
[02:30:31.357 --> 02:30:34.778]  Of course, he supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good senator.
[02:30:34.778 --> 02:30:44.120]  Well, the FBI released a statement during McCabe's campaign saying that Mr. McCabe, her husband, quote, played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:54.202]  Now, McAuliffe is also presently under investigation by the FBI's Washington field office regarding a probe that includes donations made on behalf of Chinese businessman Wang Wenliang.
[02:30:54.202 --> 02:30:58.522]  Well, as Trump pointed out, perhaps it's time to drain the swamp in Washington.
[02:30:58.522 --> 02:31:01.043]  I'm Margaret Halb reporting for Infowars.com.

[02:32:01.696 --> 02:32:03.997]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[02:32:03.997 --> 02:32:05.578]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[02:32:05.578 --> 02:32:09.459]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[02:32:09.459 --> 02:32:17.402]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[02:32:17.402 --> 02:32:22.384]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:32:22.384 --> 02:32:27.826]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[02:32:28.186 --> 02:32:35.976]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[02:32:35.976 --> 02:32:40.682]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[02:32:40.682 --> 02:32:46.430]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:48.592]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:50.053]  Because it leads to the future.
[02:32:50.053 --> 02:32:52.014]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:32:52.014 --> 02:32:52.815]  This is not a new world.
[02:33:13.584 --> 02:33:17.987]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:33:17.987 --> 02:33:26.413]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:33:26.413 --> 02:33:34.478]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:33:34.478 --> 02:33:40.202]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[02:33:40.202 --> 02:33:42.483]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:33:52.148 --> 02:33:54.169]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:54.169 --> 02:33:59.271]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:59.271 --> 02:34:07.134]  I'm gonna go ahead and post the fourth hour and I'm Joel Scouser.
[02:34:07.134 --> 02:34:08.415]  Come back in here and take your calls.
[02:34:11.383 --> 02:34:18.564]  We have more of the Hillary emails coming out, where she's running the press, where they're staging questions.
[02:34:18.564 --> 02:34:22.865]  The biggest thing is up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com right now.
[02:34:22.865 --> 02:34:28.646]  New Podesta email exposes playbook for rigging polls through oversamples.
[02:34:28.646 --> 02:34:31.786]  Now, we don't need WikiLeaks to tell us this.
[02:34:31.786 --> 02:34:34.727]  But the media, the controlled media, has never made a deal out of this.
[02:34:34.727 --> 02:34:37.667]  This has been going on for a year, where they'll sample 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40, sometimes 50 something.
[02:34:40.965 --> 02:34:43.167]  More Democrats than they do Republicans.
[02:34:43.167 --> 02:34:45.048]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:34:45.048 --> 02:34:49.611]  We sampled 22% Republicans and 46% Democrats.
[02:34:49.611 --> 02:34:54.474]  I mean, you're reading this in Reuters polls, you're reading this in Bloomberg polls, and you're pinching yourself.
[02:34:54.474 --> 02:34:58.777]  Any moron can tell this is totally rigged.
[02:34:58.777 --> 02:35:01.999]  So, that's going on.
[02:35:01.999 --> 02:35:06.782]  And what's amazing is we see with the investigative reports of Project Veritas, the Veritas Project,
[02:35:08.677 --> 02:35:14.063]  ProjectVeritas.com, they're on the ground, investigative reports, they're infiltration of the Democratic Party.
[02:35:14.063 --> 02:35:20.151]  National heads saying, we're going to steal the election, we've got people voting repeatedly, we're busing them around, nothing's going to stop us.
[02:35:20.151 --> 02:35:26.639]  And then now, we've got them confirming Hillary Clinton approved Robert Cramer plan directly.
[02:35:27.554 --> 02:35:34.978]  So there's a bunch of new developments, and we're joined by Stephen Gordon, Director of Special Operations and Senior Communications Strategist at Project Veritas.
[02:35:34.978 --> 02:35:36.519]  You talk about a dangerous position to be in.
[02:35:36.519 --> 02:35:44.643]  If there's anybody they hate more than me, it's probably Matt Drudge or the Project Veritas folks.
[02:35:44.643 --> 02:35:56.790]  He was the first person to put Homeland Security document, right-wing extremism, current economic and political environment, fueling resurgence of radicalization and recruitment online for everyone to see, which identified all libertarians and conservatives as extremists.
[02:35:57.947 --> 02:35:59.689]  Yeah, I remember.
[02:35:59.689 --> 02:36:00.850]  We got a lot of those documents, too.
[02:36:00.850 --> 02:36:02.492]  People didn't think they were real at first.
[02:36:02.492 --> 02:36:03.333]  So crazy.
[02:36:03.333 --> 02:36:07.577]  So, Stephen, Gordon, thank you for joining us for the latest developments.
[02:36:07.577 --> 02:36:08.398]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:36:08.398 --> 02:36:08.838]  How are you?
[02:36:09.798 --> 02:36:10.939]  Wow.
[02:36:10.939 --> 02:36:11.839]  It makes my head spin.
[02:36:11.839 --> 02:36:12.979]  In fact, let me ask you that question.
[02:36:12.979 --> 02:36:13.760]  I forgot to ask that.
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:17.822]  I don't want to get into the inside of baseball, but you guys have never cried wolf with us.
[02:36:17.822 --> 02:36:19.502]  Last Friday you were like, we're really concerned.
[02:36:19.502 --> 02:36:20.183]  Some stuff's going on.
[02:36:20.183 --> 02:36:21.603]  We may need to send you video.
[02:36:21.603 --> 02:36:25.285]  Casey tried to shut us down, and then we never got more info.
[02:36:25.285 --> 02:36:27.246]  But I mean, I've never heard you guys get concerned like that.
[02:36:27.246 --> 02:36:29.307]  There must be some wild stuff happening.
[02:36:29.926 --> 02:36:32.187]  There's a lot of, we're getting threats all the time.
[02:36:32.187 --> 02:36:40.012]  Right now, right out there, one of our former, one of those spooks that works for the government, used to work for the government, is walking around with a gun in the office.
[02:36:40.012 --> 02:36:42.894]  That's how seriously we're taking this right now.
[02:36:42.894 --> 02:36:48.538]  But, like we gave you half of a secret key so that if something happens to James, you can get it out.
[02:36:48.538 --> 02:36:54.642]  We're getting a lot of criticism from friendly people that they're concerned, well, they're just going to take Alex Jones out too.
[02:36:54.642 --> 02:36:57.744]  So, I mean, I just want to make it clear to our friendly people that
[02:36:58.991 --> 02:37:02.254]  There are other people out there that have codes too, so it doesn't matter.
[02:37:02.254 --> 02:37:05.596]  They can't stop this story from continuing to go on.
[02:37:05.596 --> 02:37:08.699]  We need to let them know, just like the WikiLeaks, that multiple groups have it.
[02:37:08.699 --> 02:37:09.980]  You're not going to shut up the signal.
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:11.741]  That's what gives us protection.
[02:37:11.741 --> 02:37:12.742]  Exactly.
[02:37:12.742 --> 02:37:17.726]  And that's why we know we're relatively safe, because too many people have the story.
[02:37:17.726 --> 02:37:19.888]  If we disappear, that makes an even bigger story.
[02:37:20.228 --> 02:37:24.052]  And that's of course what Jim Garrison and the whole JFK investigation, the DA, said.
[02:37:24.052 --> 02:37:30.238]  The only reason he was still alive and not, you know, the other hundreds of dead was he was so public and his info was distributed.
[02:37:30.238 --> 02:37:31.559]  Now let's get into this latest report.
[02:37:31.559 --> 02:37:32.340]  It's up on Breitbart.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:34.222]  It's up at ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:37:34.222 --> 02:37:35.583]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:37:35.583 --> 02:37:38.986]  We've probably got some video we're going to roll as well of this latest coup.
[02:37:39.967 --> 02:37:44.213]  I can tell you right now, the DNC and Hillary Clinton are flipping out.
[02:37:44.213 --> 02:37:55.027]  They're flipping the freak out right now, because just yesterday, Clinton's campaign manager went on CNN, on State of the Nation, and he said, quote, they, he's talking about Vogel and Kramer,
[02:37:55.687 --> 02:37:59.030]  Never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign.
[02:37:59.030 --> 02:38:10.581]  Now the video we just put out today, a little afternoon today, that you're fixing to show, shows time after time after time where the direction came directly from Hillary's mouth.
[02:38:10.581 --> 02:38:15.045]  It's unequivocable, it's straight up, and we just caught him in another major lie.
[02:38:17.159 --> 02:38:20.301]  Amazing, and a lot of folks know, obviously, about Veritas.
[02:38:20.301 --> 02:38:23.484]  Tens of millions of views on the latest cube, just on one video alone.
[02:38:23.484 --> 02:38:28.748]  But recap for folks, why this is so important, who Kramer is, and then who his minion is.
[02:38:29.747 --> 02:38:35.252]  Okay, Kramer's, I mean, he's been in the White House hundreds of times, met over 40 times with Bill Clinton.
[02:38:35.252 --> 02:38:42.138]  He runs a consulting firm, but they talk in the first video about this whole chain of money, about who pays whom.
[02:38:42.138 --> 02:38:43.720]  The DNC pays the campaigner.
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:44.941]  I mean, I got it backwards.
[02:38:44.941 --> 02:38:46.922]  Which pays this group, which pays that organization.
[02:38:46.922 --> 02:38:48.504]  They admit it on tape.
[02:38:48.504 --> 02:38:49.285]  They admit the money.
[02:38:49.285 --> 02:38:53.649]  And they say Hillary and the White House and everybody don't want the public to know this.
[02:38:54.329 --> 02:38:55.669]  Yes, exactly.
[02:38:55.669 --> 02:38:59.770]  They keep saying it over and over again, but they talk to our undercover reporters.
[02:38:59.770 --> 02:39:02.170]  So we now have it on film, it's out there.
[02:39:02.170 --> 02:39:08.732]  The mainstream media isn't, we've forced them to cover it some, but they're covering it grudgingly, let's say.
[02:39:08.732 --> 02:39:10.172]  And it's out there though.
[02:39:10.172 --> 02:39:20.894]  Too many Americans, millions and millions and millions of Americans have seen this thanks to programs like yours, thanks to the internet, thanks to just being able to work around the mainstream media.
[02:39:20.894 --> 02:39:22.094]  Well, what are they going to do when
[02:39:23.783 --> 02:39:33.786]  One of your videos gets 10-15 million views, the next video gets 10 million views, and you bring down Acorn, you bring down all these criminal organizations, and they still just sit there and act like you don't exist.
[02:39:33.786 --> 02:39:34.966]  It's this paradox.
[02:39:34.966 --> 02:39:36.547]  They're totally discredited.
[02:39:36.547 --> 02:39:38.247]  They now want to openly steal the election.
[02:39:38.247 --> 02:39:39.927]  They keep saying Trump's going to drop out.
[02:39:39.927 --> 02:39:41.088]  All of it's a hoax.
[02:39:41.088 --> 02:39:44.909]  This seems to be a battle between a hoax and reality.
[02:39:45.782 --> 02:39:47.903]  The American people are not that stupid.
[02:39:47.903 --> 02:39:49.544]  I mean, they can do whatever they want.
[02:39:49.544 --> 02:39:55.428]  At some point, just, everything's just, it's almost, it's an electronic revolution now.
[02:39:55.428 --> 02:40:00.030]  Half of the people out there are saying BS to all this that's been going on for so long.
[02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:02.332]  Your audience is leading the way.
[02:40:02.332 --> 02:40:09.996]  But, it's beyond the point that I think the mainstream media and the establishment and the Clintonistas can control it anymore.
[02:40:09.996 --> 02:40:12.477]  I want to play this clip.
[02:40:12.477 --> 02:40:13.858]  We've got several.
[02:40:13.858 --> 02:40:14.939]  What's the first one we've got, Nico?
[02:40:17.602 --> 02:40:20.043]  Because there's several here that I want to get to.
[02:40:20.043 --> 02:40:21.144]  You've sent us several clips.
[02:40:21.144 --> 02:40:23.745]  You want to set these up for us?
[02:40:23.745 --> 02:40:27.386]  I'm not sure which one I'm setting up, so... Yeah, well, I've got a couple.
[02:40:27.386 --> 02:40:32.428]  Let's just go to this first clip, then, the latest from Project Veritas, and then you can describe it afterwards.
[02:40:32.428 --> 02:40:33.189]  Here it is.
[02:40:33.189 --> 02:40:33.409]  All right.
[02:40:43.996 --> 02:40:47.958]  We just have to be careful about these things and talk about them.
[02:40:47.958 --> 02:40:50.479]  We have to clear this with DNC.
[02:40:50.479 --> 02:40:53.081]  With Democrat National Committee.
[02:40:53.081 --> 02:40:55.442]  So this is just basically what we said.
[02:40:55.442 --> 02:41:00.984]  It's a setup of them saying you got to cover it up and then you can talk.
[02:41:02.445 --> 02:41:09.808]  If the future president of the United States wanted ducks on the ground, what have I got if we can get ducks on the ground?
[02:41:09.808 --> 02:41:11.569]  Oh, so it's...wow.
[02:41:11.569 --> 02:41:13.109]  Don't read that tape, please.
[02:41:13.109 --> 02:41:14.130]  Don't read that tape, please.
[02:41:14.130 --> 02:41:18.431]  I think this duck is going to get swept up somewhere.
[02:41:18.431 --> 02:41:20.632]  I just got punched on Monday morning.
[02:41:20.632 --> 02:41:22.573]  I mean, I was in a duck costume.
[02:41:22.573 --> 02:41:27.775]  If the future president of the United States wanted ducks on the ground, we will put ducks on the ground.
[02:41:28.275 --> 02:41:35.040]  This is part three of our undercover investigation into the dark backroom dealings of the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:45.246]  In this story, we'll show an illegal dark money conspiracy between the Hillary Clinton campaign, the DNC, and the non-for-profit corporation Americans United for Change.
[02:41:45.246 --> 02:41:47.208]  And it's all disguised as a duck.
[02:41:48.715 --> 02:42:00.580]  Now the full report, I wanted to see which clip, because this is coming in so fast, I didn't have time to actually go over it all, which clip was going to come out first, actually proving it, or just showing the intro.
[02:42:00.580 --> 02:42:11.604]  But what you just saw was the intro, and then in the video it breaks down and they confirm that this is, again, Hillary Clinton that is directing all this, when they're on national TV, saying that they're not directing all of this.
[02:42:12.444 --> 02:42:22.806]  And time and time again through the video you'll see somebody or another saying Hillary directed it, Hillary called the shots, Hillary wanted ducks on the ground, so by God we got ducks on the ground.
[02:42:22.806 --> 02:42:28.747]  That's when they had people dressing up as Donald Duck to protest at Trump events.
[02:42:28.747 --> 02:42:33.568]  Also they were using Trump as agitators like they did in the second video we showed about the violence.
[02:42:33.568 --> 02:42:38.429]  They were trying to get people to punch the ducks just so they could say that Trump supporters are violent.
[02:42:39.255 --> 02:42:45.738]  And expanding, they say right here in the video that they wanted to create anarchy around Trump, presumably to make him less appealing to American voters.
[02:42:45.738 --> 02:42:51.961]  So, that's what they sent obnoxious Donald Ducks to bird dog people to get a response.
[02:42:51.961 --> 02:42:58.684]  It's like they wanted to send people in to have women do obnoxious stuff to hope that security drug out women to say, look, they're violent against women.
[02:42:59.739 --> 02:43:05.123]  And these Donald Ducks, to be clear, and this video makes it clear, it wasn't the idea of some low-level operative.
[02:43:05.123 --> 02:43:08.486]  It wasn't the idea of some just activist on the ground.
[02:43:08.486 --> 02:43:11.948]  It was the idea of Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[02:43:11.948 --> 02:43:12.929]  It came from the top.
[02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:15.101]  Wow.
[02:43:15.101 --> 02:43:19.685]  Now, WikiLeaks obviously is now releasing data dumps every day or two.
[02:43:19.685 --> 02:43:24.029]  We've got less than 14 days, 13 and a half days here, Steven Gordon, ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:43:24.029 --> 02:43:31.216]  I know you don't want to tell the enemy exactly what you're doing, you know, moment to moment, but obviously we can expect a lot more now.
[02:43:31.957 --> 02:43:40.585]  Yeah, we are going to be releasing at least one, two, three major videos and minor stuff, but a lot of it depends on how they respond.
[02:43:40.585 --> 02:43:47.671]  I couldn't predict yesterday that Robbie Mook was going to be on CNN saying that they've never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign.
[02:43:47.671 --> 02:43:51.755]  So we may have stuff that comes out tomorrow just because of what they say today.
[02:43:51.755 --> 02:43:53.036]  We have to see how this plays out.
[02:43:53.976 --> 02:43:54.837]  Incredible.
[02:43:54.837 --> 02:43:58.138]  How is the founder of Project Veritas doing right now?
[02:43:58.138 --> 02:43:59.039]  He is tired.
[02:43:59.039 --> 02:44:02.981]  We've all been working almost non-stop, but he's doing an interview right now.
[02:44:02.981 --> 02:44:07.504]  That's why I'm here is because we got three people doing interviews as fast as we can crank them out.
[02:44:08.612 --> 02:44:09.853]  Well, you're doing a great job.
[02:44:09.853 --> 02:44:15.435]  The full video is up on InfoWars.com, Breitbart.com, ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:44:15.435 --> 02:44:23.878]  They've been somewhat successful, somewhat successful, blacking out again on MSN, but these average shows have a couple hundred thousand viewers.
[02:44:23.878 --> 02:44:25.159]  You guys, again as I've said,
[02:44:26.229 --> 02:44:31.751]  Tens of millions of views just on your latest stories, so it seems like they're living in their own fantasy land.
[02:44:31.751 --> 02:44:32.951]  That's just YouTube views.
[02:44:32.951 --> 02:44:38.512]  I mean, we have tons of, we put these short clips out on Twitter that may have 10 or 20 or 50,000 views.
[02:44:38.512 --> 02:44:43.854]  We'll get 50, sometimes 100, 250,000 views on just a video we upload to Facebook.
[02:44:43.854 --> 02:44:45.154]  That's not counting the people.
[02:44:45.154 --> 02:44:48.555]  Fox News has been running us every hour on the hour for the last few days.
[02:44:48.555 --> 02:44:51.836]  And in fairness to them, they're basically the only channel doing this.
[02:44:51.836 --> 02:44:54.037]  On others, they just say, James O'Keefe, a criminal.
[02:44:54.577 --> 02:44:55.058]  Well, yes.
[02:44:55.058 --> 02:45:00.302]  He went into a senator's office who was claiming her phones were broken to show that the phones were working.
[02:45:00.302 --> 02:45:02.384]  That's what investigative journalists do.
[02:45:02.384 --> 02:45:03.285]  That's not a criminal.
[02:45:03.285 --> 02:45:06.188]  But they never say why he's a convicted criminal.
[02:45:06.188 --> 02:45:17.259]  Yeah, one of my favorite spots of recent media on this, Megyn Kelly had Donna Brazile on, and Donna Brazile starts saying, and that criminal, so Megyn Kelly and Jackson there, oh, you mean Bob Kramer?
[02:45:18.257 --> 02:45:22.558]  Because he's the one that actually was convicted of a felony and spent time in jail.
[02:45:22.558 --> 02:45:23.338]  That's right.
[02:45:23.338 --> 02:45:25.178]  Wasn't it like bank fraud or something?
[02:45:25.178 --> 02:45:26.358]  Yeah, I don't remember.
[02:45:26.358 --> 02:45:28.239]  They always do the wire charge thing.
[02:45:28.239 --> 02:45:31.079]  But it was just campaign corruption kind of stuff.
[02:45:31.079 --> 02:45:45.202]  Sure, but I mean, meanwhile, Veritas, I mean, going into a public building to see if someone's office, to see if the phones are really broken or not, I mean, that's what investigative journalists do.
[02:45:45.202 --> 02:45:45.862]  That's not criminal.
[02:45:46.738 --> 02:45:55.171]  Well, the actual charge that they got O'Keefe on was a misdemeanor, was entering a federal building under false pretenses.
[02:45:55.171 --> 02:45:58.497]  Now, if that's against the law, they should arrest every last member of Congress.
[02:46:00.216 --> 02:46:02.278]  That's a good one, Stephen Gordon.
[02:46:02.278 --> 02:46:12.528]  Stephen, what was it like in last week's debate to see Trump point at Hillary Clinton and say, we now have the video, we now have the documents, you sent the people to disrupt my events and that was illegal.
[02:46:12.528 --> 02:46:16.652]  You tried to cause riots, you got police officers and citizens hurt, you're a criminal.
[02:46:16.652 --> 02:46:17.413]  I mean, that was powerful.
[02:46:18.314 --> 02:46:21.178]  My ears are still ringing because the whole office is watching.
[02:46:21.178 --> 02:46:30.249]  We're sitting in the office watching the debate on the big screen TV and everybody just started yelling and jumping and cheering and screaming so loud that my ears are still ringing to this day.
[02:46:32.335 --> 02:46:34.516]  Now, I've been asking some of the questions here, Stephen Gordon.
[02:46:34.516 --> 02:46:38.059]  What else is on your radar screen you want to relate to the viewers and listeners?
[02:46:38.059 --> 02:46:42.181]  Well, one of the next videos we're going to be putting out, I'll give you a little tease on it.
[02:46:42.181 --> 02:46:45.703]  It's not so much of a smoking gun type videos, it's the whole process.
[02:46:45.703 --> 02:46:47.665]  It's a different kind of smoking gun, let's put it that way.
[02:46:48.485 --> 02:47:01.310]  We're going to have a guy who came in as a donor and a major donor and you're going to see through his eyes what it was like as he's, you know, offering big chunks of money to them and how far they're willing to go and what they're willing to do for that.
[02:47:01.310 --> 02:47:09.534]  And it got so high and so far up that they even sent one of our undercover operatives to the White House or attempted to send her to.
[02:47:09.534 --> 02:47:11.735]  We couldn't do it, but they attempted to send her to the White House.
[02:47:11.735 --> 02:47:16.497]  So when they're saying the White House isn't involved, once again, we're going to show that that's BS.
[02:47:17.257 --> 02:47:28.270]  And to be clear, because James told us about this last week, you could have even gotten her in, but you guys didn't want to basically forge stuff, thinking they might charge you for getting an undercover journalist inside the White House, so that didn't happen.
[02:47:28.270 --> 02:47:31.113]  I mean, you guys have really done some amazing investigative work.
[02:47:31.954 --> 02:47:33.434]  I appreciate that.
[02:47:33.434 --> 02:47:34.895]  Journalists are really awesome.
[02:47:34.895 --> 02:47:36.435]  They work really hard.
[02:47:36.435 --> 02:47:38.576]  And they put their necks on the line.
[02:47:38.576 --> 02:47:41.457]  And we're very appreciative for all the very hard work they do.
[02:47:41.457 --> 02:47:42.357]  Well, sure.
[02:47:42.357 --> 02:47:49.639]  The gentleman that reportedly leaked stuff to WikiLeaks on the scams and how Hillary was running the DNC...
[02:47:51.345 --> 02:47:54.326]  Got shot four times in the back when he was going to talk to the FBI.
[02:47:54.326 --> 02:47:57.047]  I mean, this is a dangerous time to be alive.
[02:47:57.047 --> 02:48:01.188]  And I want viewers and listeners to understand, we're not being drama queens here or drama kings.
[02:48:01.188 --> 02:48:04.989]  People need to understand, this is frontline information war, okay?
[02:48:04.989 --> 02:48:06.869]  This is the battle for America.
[02:48:06.869 --> 02:48:10.410]  This isn't a battle on some foreign land or some shore, which is very important.
[02:48:10.410 --> 02:48:12.751]  I'm not taking away from our veterans like my grandfathers.
[02:48:12.751 --> 02:48:14.871]  I'm just saying, this is 21st century war.
[02:48:14.871 --> 02:48:15.872]  People are dying.
[02:48:15.872 --> 02:48:17.292]  People are being sued.
[02:48:17.292 --> 02:48:18.613]  They're losing their livelihood.
[02:48:18.613 --> 02:48:19.873]  I mean, this is a war.
[02:48:20.573 --> 02:48:24.357]  They've tried that with James, but you know what?
[02:48:24.357 --> 02:48:27.219]  Every year, we get twice as big as we were before.
[02:48:27.219 --> 02:48:30.882]  I don't care where they count donors, or whatever metric you want to use.
[02:48:30.882 --> 02:48:34.726]  The amount of supporters we have, the size of our company, the amount of employees we have.
[02:48:34.726 --> 02:48:36.167]  It doesn't matter.
[02:48:36.167 --> 02:48:39.991]  By every metric, we double every year, and the more they throw at us, the bigger we get.
[02:48:42.933 --> 02:48:48.636]  Stephen Gordon, thank you so much for everything you're doing and look forward for more of these big stories coming out in the next few days.
[02:48:48.636 --> 02:48:49.636]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:48:49.636 --> 02:48:50.717]  You guys take care.
[02:48:50.717 --> 02:48:52.178]  Absolutely, God bless you.
[02:48:52.178 --> 02:48:53.518]  Alright folks, so there you go.
[02:48:53.518 --> 02:48:55.219]  I'm going to go to break, come back and take more of your calls.
[02:48:55.219 --> 02:48:57.700]  I'm going to go a little bit in the next hour with Joel Skousen.
[02:48:57.700 --> 02:48:59.421]  That's all coming up as well.
[02:48:59.421 --> 02:49:00.422]  But before I go any further,
[02:49:00.922 --> 02:49:09.445]  We're supported by some amazing sponsors, and when you hear me endorse a sponsor, that means I've checked into it, and I think it's a high-quality product, and it's somebody that I'm actually using.
[02:49:09.445 --> 02:49:15.788]  I'm talking about Harvest Rite, I've got Harvest Rite Systems, you know, I'm talking about gold, I'm getting gold from the place, you name it.
[02:49:15.788 --> 02:49:18.089]  Solutions for Science, that's where I get my solar generators.
[02:49:18.089 --> 02:49:20.990]  Ten years ago, I said, hey, I'm getting one of these from you, you should be a sponsor.
[02:49:21.772 --> 02:49:24.013]  That's how a lot of these sponsorships start.
[02:49:24.013 --> 02:49:28.055]  But HarvestRight.com just has the best dehydrators out there.
[02:49:28.055 --> 02:49:30.797]  They're great systems, they look great, they're wonderful.
[02:49:30.797 --> 02:49:36.240]  HarvestRight created the most amazing home appliance, a home freeze dryer that helps you be prepared.
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:42.081]  This appliance allows you to freeze and dry your own food at home.
[02:49:42.081 --> 02:49:45.441]  We can go to their website, HarvestRite.com, put it on screen for folks.
[02:49:45.441 --> 02:49:55.463]  Freeze-drying locks in 100% of the food's nutrition, so even 25 years later, your food is just as healthy and tasty as the day it was made.
[02:49:55.463 --> 02:50:01.844]  You can freeze-dry foods such as garden produce and proteins, even whole meals like lasagna and beef stew.
[02:50:01.844 --> 02:50:05.385]  HarvestRite sent us some freeze-dried food and I couldn't believe how fresh it tasted.
[02:50:05.825 --> 02:50:06.126]  We're good.
[02:50:22.372 --> 02:50:27.897]  When we come back, I'll tell you about Solutions from Science because they're also a great sponsor with their solar panel systems and more.
[02:50:27.897 --> 02:50:34.744]  Don't forget, we also have 25% off on our great nootropic brain force at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:50:34.744 --> 02:50:35.885]  And we have a lot of other specials.
[02:50:35.885 --> 02:50:37.907]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[02:50:37.907 --> 02:50:40.189]  We have the Donald Trump's My President red shirts.
[02:50:40.189 --> 02:50:41.871]  We can all wear those on the election.
[02:50:41.871 --> 02:50:42.632]  So order them quickly.
[02:50:42.632 --> 02:50:43.573]  We're only 14 days out.
[02:50:44.353 --> 02:50:45.956]  We also have the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[02:50:45.956 --> 02:50:48.979]  In 14 days, I will stop selling the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[02:50:48.979 --> 02:50:50.421]  It's $9.95 at cost.
[02:50:50.421 --> 02:50:57.310]  And we also are down about $100,000 of the bumper stickers you can buy at cost in packs of 10 up to 100 of Hillary for Prison.
[02:50:57.310 --> 02:50:57.991]  We'll be back.
[02:50:57.991 --> 02:50:58.572]  Stay with us.
[02:50:58.572 --> 02:50:59.634]  Make America free again.
[02:51:02.113 --> 02:51:12.981]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[02:51:19.265 --> 02:51:24.729]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:24.889 --> 02:51:34.895]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:34.895 --> 02:51:41.359]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:41.359 --> 02:51:44.681]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:51:44.681 --> 02:51:46.742]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:46.742 --> 02:51:49.684]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:49.864 --> 02:51:52.348]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[02:53:33.395 --> 02:53:34.596]  Change has come to America!
[02:53:34.596 --> 02:53:42.939]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, and beef was for supper.
[02:53:42.939 --> 02:53:45.761]  Revelation, dawn of global government.

[02:53:56.625 --> 02:53:59.167]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[02:53:59.167 --> 02:54:00.007]  Let's fix it.
[02:54:24.813 --> 02:54:29.315]  Alright, riding shotgun with us 30 minutes to the next hour, then Rob Duesen to take over is Joel Skousen.
[02:54:29.315 --> 02:54:39.218]  By the way, the leftists, I'm not kidding, and this whole George Soros thing, we know they're funded by him, are like creating anti-white, Hispanic, black fervor in East Austin.
[02:54:39.218 --> 02:54:46.660]  And the city of Austin through UT is basically running the gentrification program while creating the destabilizations.
[02:54:46.660 --> 02:54:47.721]  The reason I raise this is
[02:54:48.701 --> 02:54:50.662]  It's happening right here in Austin.
[02:54:50.662 --> 02:54:53.203]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:54:53.203 --> 02:54:56.665]  Racist social justice warriors terrorize owner of cat sanctuary.
[02:54:56.665 --> 02:54:59.426]  Leftists bombard Blue Cat Cafe proprietor with death threats.
[02:54:59.426 --> 02:55:00.627]  Vandalize their property.
[02:55:00.627 --> 02:55:04.329]  Send messages of dead cats and hope to kick them off the property.
[02:55:04.329 --> 02:55:05.389]  Because they're white.
[02:55:05.389 --> 02:55:06.149]  I'm not kidding.
[02:55:06.149 --> 02:55:09.031]  This is what the KKK would do to blacks in the South.
[02:55:09.031 --> 02:55:11.872]  I mean this pisses me off to no end.
[02:55:11.872 --> 02:55:15.474]  And then they have the communists out there saying get out.
[02:55:15.474 --> 02:55:17.155]  And so it shut them down for a few days.
[02:55:18.035 --> 02:55:21.337]  And they're taking care of hundreds of cats they're going to have to euthanize.
[02:55:21.337 --> 02:55:24.659]  So people got mad about this and they just contacted us and are thanking us.
[02:55:24.659 --> 02:55:28.642]  They've raised $5,000 since this went up this morning.
[02:55:28.642 --> 02:55:29.723]  Gentrified scum.
[02:55:29.723 --> 02:55:31.724]  And they came and told them, you're white, get out of here.
[02:55:31.724 --> 02:55:32.464]  This was white people.
[02:55:32.464 --> 02:55:36.987]  So it's this weird thing where there'll be these white communist managers over the minorities.
[02:55:36.987 --> 02:55:41.710]  It is the most bizarre crap I've ever heard because they do not want the minorities getting prosperity.
[02:55:41.710 --> 02:55:45.413]  Everything, and they admit in the WikiLeaks, is about keeping everybody, but minorities first.
[02:55:46.073 --> 02:55:52.918]  As debtor slaves down the rental plantation, so you never become successful, and so you never become free market.
[02:55:52.918 --> 02:56:01.323]  There's a race to kill the American engine of prosperity because it competes so powerfully with socialist systems like North Korea and communist systems.
[02:56:01.323 --> 02:56:02.584]  Is that an accurate statement?
[02:56:02.584 --> 02:56:02.944]  That's right.
[02:56:02.944 --> 02:56:04.445]  In other words, if you're white, you're racist.
[02:56:04.445 --> 02:56:10.470]  And if you're white, you know, you need to feel guilty for succeeding, for getting above anyone else.
[02:56:10.470 --> 02:56:11.730]  Or saving cats.
[02:56:11.730 --> 02:56:12.391]  Right.
[02:56:12.391 --> 02:56:13.812]  And these are like white hippies.
[02:56:15.336 --> 02:56:17.519]  And notice who's coming to the raid.
[02:56:17.519 --> 02:56:18.200]  Alex Jones.
[02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:25.669]  And I come to, Hispanics, blacks, you know when the CPS is taking some black family's kids because they live in what you could say was a shack.
[02:56:25.669 --> 02:56:29.273]  The guy's worked for 20 years for the city and has no criminal record and he's a good guy.
[02:56:29.273 --> 02:56:30.855]  You know it's not illegal to be poor.
[02:56:30.855 --> 02:56:32.076]  We came to his aid and got his kids back.
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:34.701]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:34.701 --> 02:56:35.341]  I mean, I'm ranting.
[02:56:35.341 --> 02:56:36.562]  I'm not saying we're heroes.
[02:56:36.562 --> 02:56:38.283]  I just, we try to stand up for everybody.
[02:56:38.283 --> 02:56:38.723]  That's right.
[02:56:38.723 --> 02:56:39.564]  Let's take some calls.
[02:56:39.564 --> 02:56:40.504]  They've been waiting a long time.
[02:56:40.504 --> 02:56:40.945]  Absolutely.
[02:56:40.945 --> 02:56:42.206]  Let's do some of those calls here.
[02:56:42.206 --> 02:56:44.467]  Uh, let's go to Bruce in Michigan.
[02:56:44.467 --> 02:56:45.308]  Then we'll go to everybody else.
[02:56:45.308 --> 02:56:46.829]  Go ahead, Bruce.
[02:56:46.829 --> 02:56:47.809]  Hello, Mr. Scott.
[02:56:47.809 --> 02:56:51.211]  I listened to you when you were on Dr. Stanley Monte back in 2011.
[02:56:51.211 --> 02:56:53.153]  Uh, we miss him.
[02:56:53.153 --> 02:56:54.213]  We miss him dearly.
[02:56:54.213 --> 02:56:55.754]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:56:55.754 --> 02:56:56.975]  Um, it's been five years.
[02:56:56.975 --> 02:57:00.978]  Haven't the Russians heard your scenario for five years and are they
[02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:06.233]  Predetermined or predestined to have to follow that kind of scenario?
[02:57:06.233 --> 02:57:11.937]  Also, very importantly, could Russia and China have secret weapons that they could bring out?
[02:57:11.937 --> 02:57:16.079]  Or are the American secret weapons luciferian?
[02:57:16.079 --> 02:57:18.281]  Oh boy, that's a lot of questions there.
[02:57:18.281 --> 02:57:26.466]  But I, as I told Alex, I know that they have been listening to what we say, but remember it's in their DNA to attack the West.
[02:57:26.466 --> 02:57:27.347]  This is, in fact,
[02:57:28.064 --> 02:57:34.628]  I'm of the opinion, frankly, that Satan is running three satanic conspiracies who promise each of them success.
[02:57:34.628 --> 02:57:37.549]  The Anglo-American globalists, the Russians, and the Chinese.
[02:57:37.549 --> 02:57:42.752]  And so they all feel some kind of dark side, divine intervention.
[02:57:42.752 --> 02:57:43.293]  Predestination.
[02:57:43.293 --> 02:57:45.214]  Predestination on their behalf.
[02:57:45.214 --> 02:57:46.635]  And that's why they can't stop.
[02:57:46.635 --> 02:57:48.916]  They can't believe me.
[02:57:48.916 --> 02:57:50.357]  Even though they hear what I say.
[02:57:50.357 --> 02:57:54.159]  Let me throw this in, and I'll hold you over, Bruce, for naming his writer at the end of the hour.
[02:57:55.362 --> 02:58:05.148]  It does seem that the Anglo-American establishment truly gets the even deeper satanic, you know, kind of internet of all things satanic.
[02:58:05.148 --> 02:58:10.932]  It seems like that is the dominant group and may actually have the Luciferian predestination, or is it too soon to say?
[02:58:11.997 --> 02:58:24.371]  Well, I personally think that, you know, the Anglo-American establishment is the one that's supposed to win because it's the one who is the most sophisticated at suppressing liberty and evil and things.
[02:58:24.371 --> 02:58:25.472]  I think he has promise.
[02:58:25.472 --> 02:58:26.573]  I think Hitler was promised.
[02:58:26.573 --> 02:58:28.555]  He had all these occult-type connections.
[02:58:28.555 --> 02:58:29.897]  I think he was promised he was going to win.
[02:58:29.897 --> 02:58:31.919]  He was a forerunner, a test of the system.
[02:58:32.099 --> 02:58:38.284]  And he was betrayed, and that's why I think Russia's gonna be betrayed in this third world scenario, and China and the globals will come out on top.
[02:58:38.284 --> 02:58:40.446]  Back in 70 seconds, Bruce will give you a follow-up on that.
[02:58:40.446 --> 02:58:43.088]  We'll go to Andrew, Billy, Kristen, John and others.
[02:58:43.088 --> 02:58:44.290]  Fourth hour straight ahead, I'm hosting it.
[02:58:44.290 --> 02:58:48.153]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:51.573 --> 02:59:00.919]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid.
[02:59:00.919 --> 02:59:03.821]  The potential for power grid chaos.
[02:59:03.821 --> 02:59:11.986]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[02:59:11.986 --> 02:59:14.928]  My friends, chaos is already here, and it's gonna get a lot worse.
[02:59:15.188 --> 02:59:21.232]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[02:59:21.232 --> 02:59:25.154]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house.
[02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:27.035]  The Solutions from Science system.
[02:59:27.035 --> 02:59:29.556]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[02:59:29.556 --> 02:59:32.038]  Solutions from Science only makes the best equipment.

[03:00:03.675 --> 03:00:07.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.937 --> 03:00:10.679]  This is short segment two, long segment coming up.
[03:00:10.679 --> 03:00:11.540]  Go back to Bruce.
[03:00:27.603 --> 03:00:29.426]  Bruce, I mean, they started World War I and World War II.
[03:00:29.426 --> 03:00:31.449]  They declassified to get in a world government.
[03:00:31.449 --> 03:00:35.635]  Now they want an even bigger war to bring in, I guess, their final world government.
[03:00:35.635 --> 03:00:37.017]  A militarized world government.
[03:00:37.017 --> 03:00:39.961]  What about the technocracy, the robotics, the driverless cars?
[03:00:39.961 --> 03:00:41.063]  What's going on with that agenda, Joel?
[03:00:44.318 --> 03:00:49.243]  Boy, I haven't figured out whether or not that's involved in any form of conspiracy.
[03:00:49.243 --> 03:00:50.425]  Oh, it's totally.
[03:00:50.425 --> 03:00:52.647]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[03:00:52.647 --> 03:01:01.176]  While we're all busy fighting amongst ourselves, they believe they're setting up an AI technocracy that they control that's so sophisticated, all three groups fall under its control.
[03:01:01.176 --> 03:01:02.598]  It's kind of like the One Ring of Mordor.
[03:01:03.988 --> 03:01:07.251]  Yeah, but what does driverless vehicles have to do with controlling people, though?
[03:01:07.251 --> 03:01:12.677]  Well, it phases out humans being in control of their own travel, tracks everything you do, then they can track you.
[03:01:12.677 --> 03:01:13.618]  Yes, I can see that.
[03:01:13.618 --> 03:01:18.603]  I mean, they admit that robotics replacing us, all of this is the jewel in the eugenics crown.
[03:01:18.603 --> 03:01:25.130]  The problem is, is that I just don't know we have enough time to integrate all of this tracking and other technology.
[03:01:25.130 --> 03:01:27.092]  Once war comes, it's a totally different world.
[03:01:27.372 --> 03:01:35.538]  I know, but once they have the civil wars that come after that, that's how they plan to get everything, is with robot trucks and everything, to make humans capitulate to have jobs later.
[03:01:35.538 --> 03:01:38.601]  I'm saying after the war, that's when the robotics fully takes over.
[03:01:38.601 --> 03:01:46.667]  Yeah, I'm not sure if after this war that society is going to be able to knit itself back together to that degree of sophistication.
[03:01:46.667 --> 03:01:49.890]  I know that they're planning... No, no, globalist reservations will be run by this.
[03:01:51.135 --> 03:01:51.515]  Yes.
[03:01:51.515 --> 03:01:53.617]  Breakaway civilization.
[03:01:53.617 --> 03:01:57.099]  But I think there will always be pockets of liberty that won't be part of the globalist community.
[03:01:57.099 --> 03:01:57.699]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:01:57.699 --> 03:01:59.020]  Non-compliance is key now.
[03:01:59.020 --> 03:02:02.002]  I mean, I've never been somebody that's like civil disobedience and stuff.
[03:02:02.002 --> 03:02:03.403]  I've done some of it and been arrested.
[03:02:03.403 --> 03:02:06.865]  But at this point, we have a criminal, lawless, out-of-control government.
[03:02:06.865 --> 03:02:09.607]  I'm going to stop complying with stuff that's unconstitutional.
[03:02:09.607 --> 03:02:10.968]  And you have to prepare for that.
[03:02:10.968 --> 03:02:14.950]  What I'm saying, you can't get out of society and be self-sufficient unless you prepare and adapt.
[03:02:14.950 --> 03:02:15.550]  No, I agree.
[03:02:15.550 --> 03:02:16.631]  That's why I wanted to get you back.
[03:02:16.631 --> 03:02:17.612]  All my instincts are
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:20.701]  Get out of town.
[03:02:20.701 --> 03:02:24.203]  It's just, it's like, you know, the public's too damn demonic.
[03:02:24.203 --> 03:02:26.585]  I mean, they want to be destroyed.
[03:02:26.585 --> 03:02:30.028]  And I just don't want to be there when the, you know, when it happens.
[03:02:30.028 --> 03:02:31.429]  That's kind of a sad thought, isn't it?
[03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:32.009]  Yeah, it is.
[03:02:32.009 --> 03:02:33.330]  But most people have to be driven out.
[03:02:33.330 --> 03:02:34.711]  They won't go voluntarily.
[03:02:34.711 --> 03:02:37.793]  It's too difficult, you know, to make the break.
[03:02:37.793 --> 03:02:44.598]  And in fact, that's the godsend is that when your jobs aren't in the city anymore, because EMP and a nuclear war and other things, you're leaving.
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:46.641]  There's nothing to hold you there anymore.
[03:02:46.641 --> 03:02:47.901]  Well, absolutely.
[03:02:47.901 --> 03:02:52.203]  But even if this doesn't happen, we need to get out to get our kids away from all this.
[03:02:52.203 --> 03:02:56.526]  And that's why Obama's announced his new community activity.
[03:02:56.526 --> 03:03:06.550]  He says it's racist to live outside a city, so they're going to import buildings and little towns and bring in... I forget what color people are, bring in dependents, bring in crime.
[03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:09.632]  And that's why they're putting refugees in small towns and communities.
[03:03:11.004 --> 03:03:23.093]  So it's to kill people that, but you know, I go out and say Dripping Springs and places and where I did live, I've moved from there and you go, it's black people, Hispanics homeschooling, they get it.
[03:03:23.093 --> 03:03:25.455]  I mean, there's more and more people that actually do get it.
[03:03:25.455 --> 03:03:32.220]  They're not the majority of the white people or Hispanics or blacks, but there is a Christian group of people that understand.
[03:03:32.220 --> 03:03:34.722]  And I wish more people would get them out of the public schools.
[03:03:34.722 --> 03:03:37.864]  I can't tell you how many conservatives I've talked to lose all their children.
[03:03:37.864 --> 03:03:40.306]  None of them believe what they believe because of public schooling.
[03:03:41.877 --> 03:03:53.703]  Got to get them out of public schools no matter what the cost, because when you look at the transgender agenda, the vaccine agenda, all of the things that are required in public schooling, not to mention the propaganda and the social infection, the bad attitudes they pick up.
[03:03:53.703 --> 03:03:54.203]  Oh my God!
[03:03:54.203 --> 03:03:58.765]  It's just terribly difficult to undo bad attitudes once they get infected with those things.
[03:03:59.858 --> 03:04:07.565]  Yeah, even my children being in some sports and things, you know, they just, the way children act now, and my kids are good, it's just, it's incredible.
[03:04:07.565 --> 03:04:11.209]  Just from when I was young, I mean, I would never talk to my dad like that.
[03:04:11.209 --> 03:04:12.810]  And I'm just talking about how other kids act now.
[03:04:12.810 --> 03:04:13.551]  Yeah.
[03:04:13.551 --> 03:04:15.393]  It is, it is crazy.
[03:04:15.393 --> 03:04:16.714]  Bruce, I mean, any comeback to that?
[03:04:18.391 --> 03:04:26.634]  Final question, if we've got, if the Anglo-Americans have the superior Luciferian technology, why don't we use it right now and take over the world?
[03:04:26.634 --> 03:04:31.616]  Why are they waiting for the 2020 to 2025 window?
[03:04:31.616 --> 03:04:34.917]  Because they have to wait until they are struck by Russia and China.
[03:04:34.917 --> 03:04:35.897]  They can't induce it.
[03:04:35.897 --> 03:04:37.698]  They have got to appear the victims.
[03:04:37.698 --> 03:04:45.160]  That's when they come out of their bunkers to convince us that we've got to join in a new world order because we were victimized by Russia and China.
[03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:46.181]  That's where they have to wait.
[03:04:47.826 --> 03:04:48.547]  Wow.
[03:04:48.547 --> 03:04:50.189]  Joel Skousen, thank you, Bruce.
[03:04:50.189 --> 03:04:51.791]  And I'm going to hurry through calls now when we come back.
[03:04:51.791 --> 03:04:54.534]  Andrew in Canada and Kristen and Billy and John.
[03:04:54.534 --> 03:04:55.275]  Stay with us.
[03:04:55.275 --> 03:04:57.057]  Infowars.com is the site.
[03:04:57.057 --> 03:04:58.619]  Don't take these sites for granted, folks.
[03:04:58.619 --> 03:04:59.560]  They admit they're coming after them.
[03:05:01.465 --> 03:05:02.885]  We're red on election day.
[03:05:02.885 --> 03:05:06.006]  Perhaps the biggest election in American history is just days away.
[03:05:06.006 --> 03:05:10.628]  We know that in past elections, there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election fraud.
[03:05:10.628 --> 03:05:18.030]  From dead people voting, to people registering false identifications, to government leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes.
[03:05:18.030 --> 03:05:19.711]  This is happening right in front of us.
[03:05:19.711 --> 03:05:24.112]  Now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
[03:05:24.172 --> 03:05:26.174]  Government shills are campaigning for Clinton.
[03:05:26.174 --> 03:05:29.538]  Mainstream news attacking Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds.
[03:05:29.538 --> 03:05:36.426]  Rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[03:05:36.426 --> 03:05:38.969]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms.
[03:05:39.189 --> 03:05:42.651]  So with all this, what are we doing to keep this election from being stolen?
[03:05:42.651 --> 03:05:44.672]  What can we do to prevent election fraud?
[03:05:44.672 --> 03:05:47.894]  I propose that all Donald Trump supporters wear red on Election Day.
[03:05:47.894 --> 03:05:51.736]  On November 8th, when you head to the polls to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red.
[03:05:51.736 --> 03:05:57.879]  This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout, we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[03:05:57.879 --> 03:06:00.761]  Wear red on Election Day, and Make America Great Again!
[03:06:01.301 --> 03:06:05.285]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[03:06:05.285 --> 03:06:06.425]  Charlie Daniels.
[03:06:06.425 --> 03:06:08.287]  He's always loved America.
[03:06:08.287 --> 03:06:10.089]  He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[03:06:10.089 --> 03:06:12.931]  Let me just read a little thing here from agenda 21.
[03:06:12.931 --> 03:06:16.934]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[03:06:16.934 --> 03:06:21.098]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collected.
[03:06:21.098 --> 03:06:22.999]  Well, you know what this expo's going to be, don't you?
[03:06:22.999 --> 03:06:24.621]  There's going to be coming in a few guns.
[03:06:24.621 --> 03:06:25.421]  Oh, yeah.
[03:06:25.421 --> 03:06:27.063]  I tell you, it ain't going to sit well down my way.
[03:06:27.523 --> 03:06:28.484]  At all.
[03:06:28.484 --> 03:06:29.546]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[03:06:29.546 --> 03:06:31.628]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:31.628 --> 03:06:32.910]  It's time to ride, boys.
[03:06:32.910 --> 03:06:34.893]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[03:06:34.893 --> 03:06:40.900]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:06:40.900 --> 03:06:42.823]  Then beef was for supper.
[03:06:43.543 --> 03:06:46.006]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:46.006 --> 03:06:47.869]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:06:47.869 --> 03:06:49.530]  DVDs now available.
[03:06:49.530 --> 03:06:54.216]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:54.216 --> 03:06:57.620]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:57.620 --> 03:06:59.943]  Revelation, the movie, dot info.
[03:06:59.943 --> 03:07:00.744]  Let's fix it.
[03:07:01.024 --> 03:07:01.844]  Hey, everyone!
[03:07:01.844 --> 03:07:04.125]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:07:04.125 --> 03:07:07.966]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:07:07.966 --> 03:07:10.047]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:07:10.047 --> 03:07:20.311]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:07:20.311 --> 03:07:26.293]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:07:26.713 --> 03:07:27.134]  We're good to go.
[03:07:41.690 --> 03:07:42.170]  Thank you.
[03:08:15.510 --> 03:08:26.260]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:26.260 --> 03:08:29.062]  Again, I just cannot make a big enough deal out of this.
[03:08:29.062 --> 03:08:34.267]  We have the new WikiLeaks, where they admit that they're paying media across the board
[03:08:35.310 --> 03:08:42.524]  To over-sample Democrats, to make Hillary look like a winner, and then in the methodology of the polls, they show it!
[03:08:42.524 --> 03:08:46.170]  From 9 points at the low end, to 40-something points at the high end.
[03:08:46.170 --> 03:08:47.894]  Joel Scalzo, this is unprecedented corruption.
[03:08:49.133 --> 03:08:50.414]  It's been going on for a long time.
[03:08:50.414 --> 03:08:52.256]  Look at the 2012 election.
[03:08:52.256 --> 03:08:54.217]  They've had these multiple surges.
[03:08:54.217 --> 03:08:56.799]  Suddenly, you know, Herman Cain was surging.
[03:08:56.799 --> 03:08:58.561]  And then it was Rick Santorum surging.
[03:08:58.561 --> 03:09:02.424]  And of course, when they went to the primary, the surge disappeared.
[03:09:02.424 --> 03:09:03.425]  They had to surge someone else.
[03:09:03.425 --> 03:09:05.086]  It's all phony polling.
[03:09:05.086 --> 03:09:05.927]  Very easy to do.
[03:09:05.927 --> 03:09:10.571]  The oversampling means that in your database in CRU programming to bring up
[03:09:11.131 --> 03:09:16.974]  A certain higher percentage of Democratic-inclining voters, and you oversample those versus... And they admit it!
[03:09:16.974 --> 03:09:21.636]  So how do we counter that to people that say, I'm not going to vote now because it says Trump's going to lose?
[03:09:21.636 --> 03:09:24.178]  Well, you know, this is influencing the election before it happens.
[03:09:24.178 --> 03:09:29.400]  The only thing we can do, and I know some of your callers have asked about this, is that how do you stop vote fraud?
[03:09:29.400 --> 03:09:36.884]  Well, you've got to have demand that your local officials do a certain amount of ballot checking with paper ballots every election.
[03:09:37.444 --> 03:09:41.025]  To provide a sampling of accuracy of the computer.
[03:09:41.025 --> 03:09:50.949]  Even if they did just a small sample, they would show computer... That's right, even 5% then match that, and if somebody else is winning on the sample, you know this is bull.
[03:09:50.949 --> 03:09:57.412]  Yeah, in other words, the election officials say, no, we can't do a recount with paper ballots, it takes too long, it's too expensive, so say just do a sample.
[03:09:57.412 --> 03:10:00.813]  Give us 5% so that we know if the machine is accurate.
[03:10:00.913 --> 03:10:02.194]  And by the way, that's in a smaller town.
[03:10:02.194 --> 03:10:11.037]  From some of the studies I've seen, if you're in a city of a million people and you're going to have 400,000 voters, you can sample 1% and because it's such a larger number, it then becomes an accurate sample.
[03:10:11.037 --> 03:10:14.059]  Well, I eyeballed this in 1992 and 96.
[03:10:14.059 --> 03:10:24.203]  I went and, I mean, I was getting out of high school and I went and did this and then in college, and I was already on air in 96, I would go and they'd pay like $2 an hour.
[03:10:24.203 --> 03:10:25.344]  It really wasn't voluntarily.
[03:10:26.704 --> 03:10:27.264]  I'm digressing.
[03:10:27.264 --> 03:10:28.825]  They make you take money is the point.
[03:10:28.825 --> 03:10:34.928]  And I would go and work in the main election center and I would see Pat Buchanan in the primary, 60-70% of the votes.
[03:10:34.928 --> 03:10:37.569]  And I was talking to other people, you know, stacking the scantrons.
[03:10:37.569 --> 03:10:38.589]  Well, who's bubbled in?
[03:10:38.589 --> 03:10:39.710]  It's Pat Buchanan.
[03:10:39.710 --> 03:10:41.771]  And then he was like 6-7% at the end of the night.
[03:10:41.771 --> 03:10:43.051]  I mean, it was total fraud.
[03:10:43.051 --> 03:10:44.252]  I was sampling with my eyeballs.
[03:10:44.252 --> 03:10:45.913]  What do you make of that?
[03:10:45.913 --> 03:10:47.974]  It's absolutely fraud and it happens all the time.
[03:10:47.974 --> 03:10:49.674]  It's been happening for years.
[03:10:49.674 --> 03:10:51.215]  They're getting just better and better at it.
[03:10:51.215 --> 03:10:54.617]  But this propaganda about the media, about there can't be any fraud.
[03:10:54.617 --> 03:10:55.417]  I mean, everyone is just
[03:10:56.343 --> 03:10:58.403]  Saying we'll turn a blind eye to it.
[03:10:58.403 --> 03:11:00.404]  But if Trump fights it, what happens?
[03:11:00.404 --> 03:11:02.464]  Because he fought the theft of the primary.
[03:11:02.464 --> 03:11:05.065]  Could he then fight it and we end up winning?
[03:11:05.065 --> 03:11:13.666]  The trouble is, unless you have the process of audit in place and you try to get it afterwards, you know, they'll say, well, next election we'll do it.
[03:11:13.666 --> 03:11:15.607]  Next election they'll put it off.
[03:11:15.607 --> 03:11:20.668]  That's why I say you need to demand right now that your local officials decide to do an audit of this election.
[03:11:21.408 --> 03:11:23.289]  So that we can prove if there's fraud or not.
[03:11:23.289 --> 03:11:25.009]  I mean, you can say there's no fraud.
[03:11:25.009 --> 03:11:26.210]  Well, let's prove it then.
[03:11:26.210 --> 03:11:31.312]  Everybody audit 5% of your ballots with the paper ballots and see if the computers are acting.
[03:11:31.312 --> 03:11:33.533]  That's really a great idea.
[03:11:33.533 --> 03:11:38.475]  Andrew in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:11:38.475 --> 03:11:40.996]  Hi, thank you for taking my call.
[03:11:40.996 --> 03:11:48.619]  Dr. Skousen, I just want to say I appreciate your book and your video on strategic relocation.
[03:11:49.950 --> 03:11:53.211]  I bought it about a year ago, and it's very informative.
[03:11:53.211 --> 03:11:55.491]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:11:55.491 --> 03:12:18.116]  I'd also like your point of view on the outcome of the election, and I don't know if you watch a whole lot of TV, but The Simpsons is a good source of propaganda, and one of the things that I saw in a recent SNEW episode in the intro was Trump's daughter's name for 2028, so I don't know if you know anything about that.
[03:12:19.505 --> 03:12:28.650]  Well, I haven't heard that particular one, but certainly he's got some children that could run for office and be even more well-spoken than Donald Trump.
[03:12:28.650 --> 03:12:32.693]  As I've said here on this show, I think they cannot afford to let Trump win.
[03:12:32.693 --> 03:12:40.017]  I think they will manipulate the election result, even if they have to make 10 million votes disappear, to make sure Hillary is the winner.
[03:12:40.017 --> 03:12:45.841]  I think Trump is much closer, if not ahead, in real counts, but I doubt if they're going to let that show up.
[03:12:47.082 --> 03:12:51.457]  They must make Trump lose and they must make Trump lose big.
[03:12:52.552 --> 03:12:59.176]  It's unprecedented, but we win by supporting Trump, by promoting liberty, by promoting an awakening to globalism.
[03:12:59.176 --> 03:13:03.699]  This last two years has been a devastating victory against the New World Order worldwide.
[03:13:03.699 --> 03:13:04.259]  Absolutely.
[03:13:04.259 --> 03:13:08.541]  The Brexit, what's happening in the EU, there's a massive resistance.
[03:13:08.541 --> 03:13:11.603]  And as I say, I've always said, they'll eventually give you a war.
[03:13:11.603 --> 03:13:17.847]  That's what Helmut Kohl said in 1997, when the EU people were arguing about strengthening the treaty.
[03:13:17.847 --> 03:13:18.707]  And he said, look, the only
[03:13:20.572 --> 03:13:25.974]  Alternative to the EU is war, and everybody looked at it and there's no sentiment for war in Europe.
[03:13:25.974 --> 03:13:28.855]  And as a globalist, what he was meaning to them... We'll start one!
[03:13:28.855 --> 03:13:31.436]  ...is we'll start one if you don't go along with this voluntarily.
[03:13:31.436 --> 03:13:34.437]  We'll give you war because that'll make you turn to globalism.
[03:13:34.437 --> 03:13:35.617]  And that's the globalist threat.
[03:13:35.617 --> 03:13:40.679]  Give us what we want and we'll start World War III over and over and over again, and they'll betray us all in the end.
[03:13:40.679 --> 03:13:42.059]  Andrew, great point.
[03:13:42.059 --> 03:13:45.381]  Look, I'm not saying Joel's wrong, Joel's right most of the time.
[03:13:48.018 --> 03:13:51.300]  You didn't think the Russians were going to Syria, though, so wild things happen.
[03:13:51.300 --> 03:13:52.441]  And Trump's been different.
[03:13:52.441 --> 03:13:53.602]  He's fought things.
[03:13:53.602 --> 03:13:55.484]  He knows they're going to fight him.
[03:13:55.484 --> 03:13:57.885]  But the other alternative might end up being worse.
[03:13:57.885 --> 03:13:59.687]  Trump gets in, they sabotage him day one.
[03:13:59.687 --> 03:14:01.088]  They've got more dirt we don't know about.
[03:14:01.088 --> 03:14:01.968]  They bring it out.
[03:14:01.968 --> 03:14:10.094]  They then really try to discredit the Liberty Movement with Trump in there, and then blame the worldwide financial collapse we know they're engineering on him.
[03:14:10.094 --> 03:14:15.498]  Could be that way, but it doesn't look that way because of the uproaring of media slander against Trump.
[03:14:16.899 --> 03:14:18.761]  They're putting everything on the line.
[03:14:18.761 --> 03:14:19.082]  Yeah.
[03:14:19.082 --> 03:14:23.346]  And that's why Beck doesn't care if he loses more than half his audience, most of his sponsors.
[03:14:23.346 --> 03:14:30.834]  We've had, but I'm not trying to get his sponsors, a lot of them were ours previously, coming to us and saying, we're leaving Beck, we have no response now, we don't like him.
[03:14:30.834 --> 03:14:34.017]  I mean, if he would, I mean, he's now an apologist for conservatism.
[03:14:34.017 --> 03:14:36.480]  NPR, Face the Nation, it's embarrassing to watch.
[03:14:36.920 --> 03:14:38.802]  Yeah, I think Glenn Beck is finished.
[03:14:38.802 --> 03:14:41.043]  I think his media empire is in collapse.
[03:14:41.043 --> 03:14:45.747]  I think financially it's going to go down, but he just doesn't have any credibility anymore.
[03:14:45.747 --> 03:14:53.874]  Well, two years ago I was approached by the cable company that he's on, and they said, would you like to buy this out for $25 million?
[03:14:54.814 --> 03:14:57.756]  He's going under, and I could have come out and written a big article about it.
[03:14:57.756 --> 03:15:00.358]  I'm the big guy, they want me to... I was like, I couldn't do that.
[03:15:00.358 --> 03:15:01.778]  Are you crazy?
[03:15:01.778 --> 03:15:07.422]  Plus, nobody watches one little cable channel that's 2,000, 3,000, whatever it is.
[03:15:07.422 --> 03:15:09.103]  I don't want that thing around my neck.
[03:15:09.103 --> 03:15:10.524]  I mean, we're on the internet.
[03:15:10.524 --> 03:15:14.046]  We have videos that are getting 20 million views a week in many cases.
[03:15:14.046 --> 03:15:17.528]  Our average video gets like 300,000, and we're putting out 50 videos a day.
[03:15:17.528 --> 03:15:18.649]  I mean, it's insane, folks.
[03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:30.474]  And I'm not bragging, I'm just saying it shows the twisted thinking and then now I don't know what he thinks running back to the establishment when they sit there and make fun of him for being a Benedict Arnold.
[03:15:30.474 --> 03:15:32.415]  I mean, he just does not get it.
[03:15:32.415 --> 03:15:36.837]  I mean, I think he's gone... I don't mean to be mean to Beck, but what do you think has happened to him?
[03:15:36.837 --> 03:15:40.138]  Well, first of all, I want to comment on... He's a cautionary tale.
[03:15:40.138 --> 03:15:48.722]  But the thing I want to say, though, is that your strength and your only salvation, Alex, you stay independent of even big advertisers and that's why it's important for your listeners to support
[03:15:49.378 --> 03:15:52.139]  What you do put out, because that keeps you independent.
[03:15:52.139 --> 03:15:59.163]  Once you get tied to big advertisers, they can get that phone call in the night and say, you better cancel Glenn Beck, and that's what they're doing.
[03:15:59.163 --> 03:16:01.484]  Oh, I've had it happen to me.
[03:16:01.484 --> 03:16:09.929]  In 1999, they came to me and they said, look, you're bringing in, as a salesman, because I was smart, I wasn't just some guy getting paid a couple thousand a month on the radio, local radio, nothing.
[03:16:09.929 --> 03:16:12.270]  I had high ratings, they wouldn't pay me more, and I said, well, can I be a salesman?
[03:16:13.021 --> 03:16:15.923]  So, yeah, so I went and I said, you know, I'm now a salesman.
[03:16:15.923 --> 03:16:16.804]  Call me if you want to advertise.
[03:16:16.804 --> 03:16:18.565]  I'll have more calls I can deal with.
[03:16:18.565 --> 03:16:30.153]  I was personally making $40,000 a month at 99 when they fired me, but I was putting it all into equipment, all into computers, all in employees, was opening up an office and hired like six people, you know, was going to make higher quality films, was buying high quality equipment.
[03:16:30.153 --> 03:16:31.013]  I was putting it all back in.
[03:16:31.013 --> 03:16:34.836]  You know, driving a 10-year-old Chevy Tahoe, which isn't a bad car, but, you know, I was driving, you know.
[03:16:35.316 --> 03:16:38.178]  Usually, oh my gosh, I make $4,000 a month, I'm going to go buy something fancy.
[03:16:38.178 --> 03:16:39.759]  I didn't do that, and I'm proud of that.
[03:16:39.759 --> 03:16:54.407]  But I went and did it and built it, so when they came in and fired me, I'd already built something new and they didn't even, they were so, but they said, you're going to have an entertainment show, you're going to be mainline conservative, we're going to pay you more, you are blah, blah, blah, but you're not going to talk bad about Bill Clinton anymore, or Hillary, or the Governor Bush.
[03:16:54.407 --> 03:16:58.109]  And when I didn't shut up, I got physically attacked a month later, and then a few months after that, they fired me.
[03:16:58.814 --> 03:17:00.875]  But the point was is that exactly.
[03:17:00.875 --> 03:17:02.196]  I knew that then.
[03:17:02.196 --> 03:17:04.338]  I cannot go with just sponsorship.
[03:17:04.338 --> 03:17:08.841]  And I've also had it where sponsors call up and say, well, I don't like what you're doing on this subject.
[03:17:08.841 --> 03:17:10.842]  We don't like what you're saying now about Ted Cruz.
[03:17:10.842 --> 03:17:12.844]  So I'm still about 30% sponsorship.
[03:17:12.844 --> 03:17:16.686]  I had a big sponsor call and drop about a year ago because I wasn't supporting Ted Cruz.
[03:17:16.686 --> 03:17:18.508]  I said, OK, well, I wish you wouldn't drop, but OK.
[03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:21.552]  Well, look what they did with Rush Limbaugh.
[03:17:21.552 --> 03:17:29.118]  Before Rush Limbaugh got his first big multinational contract, he was talking openly about conspiracy and discussing that.
[03:17:29.118 --> 03:17:33.742]  And as soon as he made that change, the next caller who talked about conspiracy said, I don't know what you're talking about.
[03:17:34.622 --> 03:17:36.985]  You know, and he started to denigrate him, started to plaster him.
[03:17:36.985 --> 03:17:38.046]  That was about 1991.
[03:17:38.046 --> 03:17:38.687]  That's right.
[03:17:38.687 --> 03:17:41.009]  And it was a very, very dramatic change in everything.
[03:17:41.009 --> 03:17:42.531]  What happened to you, Rush?
[03:17:42.531 --> 03:17:47.076]  My late uncle listened to him almost every day because he was a salesman after he got out of the army.
[03:17:47.076 --> 03:17:48.017]  And he would listen.
[03:17:48.017 --> 03:17:49.679]  He said he was great.
[03:17:49.679 --> 03:17:51.381]  And he said, like, one day it just went.
[03:17:53.206 --> 03:17:55.348]  And it's just like Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly.
[03:17:55.348 --> 03:18:01.353]  I mean, they will talk about Barack Obama, they'll talk about conservatism, taking back the country, but they'll never touch conspiracy.
[03:18:01.353 --> 03:18:08.519]  And one of the first things you'll notice, if you ever bring it up and happen to mention it in a call-in to them, they'll just crucify you.
[03:18:08.519 --> 03:18:11.101]  They just turn animal against you.
[03:18:11.101 --> 03:18:12.462]  And it shows that they are
[03:18:13.980 --> 03:18:24.042]  And what's happened is, I'm going to skip this network break, we've made it safe for them to cover it, because we had Sean Hannity and Media Matters made a big deal about this, the White House, like they caught us in something.
[03:18:24.042 --> 03:18:31.783]  He came over to David Knight at the DNC and said, I really appreciate you guys' work, really appreciate what you're doing, cutting edge, thank you so much for doing this country.
[03:18:31.783 --> 03:18:39.825]  Behind the scenes, and I've talked to other people that know him, he really wants to be able to do that, and he's pushed the envelope the most, and they've come up to him and they are threatening him right now.
[03:18:41.601 --> 03:18:42.802]  So at least he has a soul.
[03:18:42.802 --> 03:18:43.442]  Yeah.
[03:18:43.442 --> 03:18:47.205]  I don't think O'Reilly, I mean O'Reilly likes being a piece of garbage.
[03:18:47.205 --> 03:18:48.106]  I don't trust O'Reilly.
[03:18:48.106 --> 03:18:56.651]  I have better feelings about Hannity, but still, he will not, he'll get nasty if you bring up conspiracy, especially if you're credible and you bring up conspiracy.
[03:18:56.651 --> 03:19:10.201]  Well then, because this is interesting to me, and I know you know some of the inside baseball on Beck, why do you think he says your uncle woke him up that he doesn't interview you, A, and then B, what happened in the last two years where he went into such a destructive course, just running with the establishment?
[03:19:11.547 --> 03:19:13.850]  Well, part of it is because of what happened at Fox News.
[03:19:13.850 --> 03:19:16.993]  You know, he kept getting close to conspiracy when he talked about George Soros.
[03:19:16.993 --> 03:19:21.018]  That was his link to George Soros, globalism, and there's got to be a conspiracy.
[03:19:21.018 --> 03:19:24.001]  And as soon as he'd get close, he'd get threatened.
[03:19:24.001 --> 03:19:31.790]  And, you know, early on he made this statement, you know, there can't be anything to 9-11, you know, and he tried to push Ron Paul into admitting that there's no conspiracy about 9-11.
[03:19:33.472 --> 03:19:39.075]  I mean, you've really got to be stupid not to see that the government story on 9-11 is just a piece of work.
[03:19:39.075 --> 03:19:39.676]  It's false.
[03:19:39.676 --> 03:19:42.597]  It was a government operation from beginning to end.
[03:19:42.597 --> 03:19:45.499]  I'll be very frank, including the hiring of the terrorists.
[03:19:45.499 --> 03:19:52.663]  And yet, Glenn Beck, he made his bed against conspiracy, and he keeps coming back to it, though.
[03:19:52.663 --> 03:19:57.405]  Even on his show, he keeps coming back to Soros and the globalists, and then his advertisers.
[03:19:57.405 --> 03:20:00.107]  He wants to run the movement, but also discredit it at the same time.
[03:20:01.027 --> 03:20:02.608]  I'm not sure he's trying to discredit it.
[03:20:02.608 --> 03:20:04.188]  I don't think he's even conscious of that, but that's what he does.
[03:20:04.188 --> 03:20:06.149]  He's just trying to be popular.
[03:20:06.149 --> 03:20:13.571]  And, you know, he's been an alcoholic, he's been a rock music nut, you know, he's got a history of mental instability, and you can see that.
[03:20:13.571 --> 03:20:15.452]  He isn't stable, he isn't solid.
[03:20:15.452 --> 03:20:17.653]  Now, he's a legitimate, sincere person.
[03:20:17.653 --> 03:20:24.095]  I mean, he did read my uncle's books, he got converted to the fact that it was a globalist conspiracy, but then he realized, I can't get ahead.
[03:20:24.915 --> 03:20:28.180]  If I push this stuff, because you get pushback from Fox.
[03:20:28.180 --> 03:20:28.621]  I agree.
[03:20:28.621 --> 03:20:30.123]  So then what happens to Infowars?
[03:20:30.123 --> 03:20:38.877]  Because they have their whole corps of people attacking us from the underbelly saying we work for the CIA or we work for the Vatican or we work for this or that.
[03:20:38.877 --> 03:20:39.418]  I mean, the truth is...
[03:20:40.619 --> 03:20:45.585]  We work for getting the truth out, trying to tell the truth, trying to be as honest as possible.
[03:20:45.585 --> 03:20:47.166]  There is no one giving me orders.
[03:20:47.166 --> 03:20:48.968]  There's no one giving us directives.
[03:20:48.968 --> 03:20:52.392]  We are real and there's literally nothing else like that out there.
[03:20:52.392 --> 03:20:53.874]  I wish there was.
[03:20:53.874 --> 03:20:55.695]  So that really freaks them out.
[03:20:55.695 --> 03:20:56.757]  So where does that go?
[03:20:56.757 --> 03:20:59.640]  Because to be the weird one-off
[03:21:01.693 --> 03:21:03.394]  And it's gotten so real now, Joel.
[03:21:03.394 --> 03:21:05.796]  I'm talking about myself, but I think about this constantly now.
[03:21:05.796 --> 03:21:06.756]  I don't like this.
[03:21:06.756 --> 03:21:13.481]  I don't like being so successful in such a dangerous game, but it's my duty to do it.
[03:21:13.481 --> 03:21:16.022]  And then I wonder, is the public even good enough to even care?
[03:21:16.022 --> 03:21:21.186]  You know, it's like... Well, you have to stop viewing it in general terms.
[03:21:21.186 --> 03:21:26.849]  You meet a specific type of people that are listening and hearing truth, and it resonates with them.
[03:21:26.849 --> 03:21:29.211]  And that's who keeps coming back, and I don't care about the rest.
[03:21:29.955 --> 03:21:38.386]  In other words, you stop trying to be popular, all things to all men, and you just say, I'm looking for the people who... Well, sure, I mean, I've never tried to do that, but what I'm saying is, is that...
[03:21:41.144 --> 03:21:43.345]  I just, I mean, it's all in the witchy leaks.
[03:21:43.345 --> 03:21:45.726]  Everything we've talked about is now admitted.
[03:21:45.726 --> 03:21:46.406]  But of course it was.
[03:21:46.406 --> 03:21:47.266]  We were going off history.
[03:21:47.266 --> 03:21:51.548]  I mean, it's so frustrating that like 95% of the conspiracy is public.
[03:21:51.548 --> 03:21:52.948]  People are being enslaved by it.
[03:21:52.948 --> 03:21:55.149]  They should wake up and we should stop it.
[03:21:55.149 --> 03:21:58.150]  And that's the interesting point, is this is the great divider of people.
[03:21:58.150 --> 03:22:00.951]  It's no longer ability to be blind anymore.
[03:22:00.951 --> 03:22:02.152]  It's all out there for you to see.
[03:22:02.152 --> 03:22:05.473]  And if you don't see it, it's because you don't want to see it.
[03:22:05.473 --> 03:22:10.335]  And that's why I say to people who are frustrated, I say, look, don't try to convince people
[03:22:11.235 --> 03:22:13.176]  Who are establishment, mainstream people.
[03:22:13.176 --> 03:22:18.218]  If they aren't upset, if they don't sense that something's wrong, I don't try with them.
[03:22:18.218 --> 03:22:19.999]  That's how you avoid the frustration.
[03:22:19.999 --> 03:22:29.764]  The latest New York Times article, the latest Washington Post article, the Statesman article, it was all like, he believes there's a global corporate government taking over that plans a world government and world taxes.
[03:22:30.504 --> 03:22:34.747]  He believes that elements of our government are funding radical Islam.
[03:22:34.747 --> 03:22:38.409]  He believes that there's a plan to forcibly inoculate.
[03:22:38.409 --> 03:22:41.291]  Everything I just said is public!
[03:22:41.291 --> 03:22:43.853]  I mean, I don't... It's like it's discrediting me?
[03:22:43.853 --> 03:22:48.315]  He believes the... I mean... And might they try that with Donald Trump?
[03:22:48.315 --> 03:22:50.437]  Or Glenn Beck said, no, I don't believe that.
[03:22:50.437 --> 03:22:52.798]  And if I were Alex Jones, I'd say, yeah, I do believe that.
[03:22:52.798 --> 03:22:55.320]  But I'm asking, where's the disconnect for these so-called journalists?
[03:22:57.758 --> 03:22:59.360]  He believes they're rigging the polls.
[03:22:59.360 --> 03:23:00.361]  Well, that's admitted.
[03:23:00.361 --> 03:23:05.407]  I don't understand how they just sit there, like the host of ABC Nightly News did to me once.
[03:23:05.407 --> 03:23:07.649]  I showed him all these clips of people calling for world government, world leaders.
[03:23:07.649 --> 03:23:10.753]  He goes, well, that's a different world government they're talking about.
[03:23:10.753 --> 03:23:12.815]  These people are actually corrupted.
[03:23:13.516 --> 03:23:17.279]  By their desire to stay within these high-paying jobs.
[03:23:17.279 --> 03:23:19.920]  I mean, look at what Obama said about conspiracy.
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:21.181]  He's reading everything.
[03:23:21.181 --> 03:23:23.162]  He's reading Alex Jones.
[03:23:23.162 --> 03:23:27.885]  And you can't read and talk about the things that you do and not see the truth in it.
[03:23:27.885 --> 03:23:30.227]  I mean, these people are actually corrupt.
[03:23:30.227 --> 03:23:32.508]  In the sense that they're fighting against what they know is true.
[03:23:32.508 --> 03:23:35.290]  There's one thing to say, I don't know.
[03:23:35.290 --> 03:23:36.731]  And to, you know, be blind.
[03:23:36.731 --> 03:23:39.032]  Well, the latest WikiLeaks say, we've got to keep them dumb.
[03:23:39.032 --> 03:23:39.973]  We've got to keep them in the dark.
[03:23:39.973 --> 03:23:40.894]  We've got to keep them distracted.
[03:23:41.584 --> 03:23:44.726]  I mean, is this like, incredible?
[03:23:44.726 --> 03:23:49.990]  I mean, we know they're evil, but they are consciously know they're, I mean, even the minions know.
[03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:53.132]  Yeah, when you consciously know, I mean, Obama knows.
[03:23:53.132 --> 03:23:56.274]  So we're not really waking people up, we're waking the patriots up that would hear.
[03:23:56.274 --> 03:24:00.417]  We're actually, a lot of people have noticed, when we wake them up, they go run and join it.
[03:24:00.417 --> 03:24:01.958]  See, that's the worst thing about my job.
[03:24:01.958 --> 03:24:06.561]  That's, and I'm not guilty about it, but I just, I put a realization last year, I mean, I knew this before, but now I'm sure of it.
[03:24:06.561 --> 03:24:08.343]  We're actually converting people to evil.
[03:24:09.315 --> 03:24:12.297]  By exposing this, I thought everybody would join against it.
[03:24:12.297 --> 03:24:13.939]  Instead, a lot of people go, oh really?
[03:24:13.939 --> 03:24:16.100]  I'm going to go grovel to it.
[03:24:16.100 --> 03:24:18.182]  It's what I said about the test.
[03:24:18.182 --> 03:24:23.085]  Knowledge is testing people's accessibility to truth.
[03:24:23.085 --> 03:24:25.187]  And we're actually helping God prove a point.
[03:24:25.187 --> 03:24:28.029]  Look, you had truth out there on earth and you didn't want it.
[03:24:28.029 --> 03:24:28.830]  You didn't want to hear it.
[03:24:29.830 --> 03:24:31.272]  And that's what conscience does.
[03:24:31.272 --> 03:24:33.957]  Conscience reinforces what's right and wrong of people.
[03:24:33.957 --> 03:24:39.585]  And when they turn against it, they're actually denying their real internal spirituality.
[03:24:39.585 --> 03:24:41.809]  And they're denying real internal truth.
[03:24:41.809 --> 03:24:42.951]  And that's why I can't sell out!
[03:24:44.318 --> 03:24:46.359]  Who I am is resisting this.
[03:24:46.359 --> 03:24:55.444]  And even though I'm not perfect, and I feel, you know, guilty because I'm not perfect, and have discernment, but I mean, I just can't stop being who I am.
[03:24:55.444 --> 03:24:57.885]  And then I ask, why aren't other people like this?
[03:24:57.885 --> 03:25:02.748]  Why would you go along with something that steals the money, 94% of the money, from Haitian kids?
[03:25:02.748 --> 03:25:04.729]  I mean, what in the world is that?
[03:25:05.109 --> 03:25:09.750]  Well, I long ago got over the fact of why people don't feel like I do or think like I do.
[03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:11.570]  I realize that people do.
[03:25:11.570 --> 03:25:16.411]  I'm just amazed at how many intelligent people are willfully blind who don't want to see.
[03:25:16.411 --> 03:25:29.794]  I even have a very, very close friend who, because he's still on the media in New York and other places, he knows that if he ever mentions the word conspiracy or believes that he might believe something, he'll be blackballed.
[03:25:30.620 --> 03:25:37.511]  And so even though he believes underneath, he won't allow himself to accept it openly because he knows it'll cost him financially.
[03:25:37.511 --> 03:25:40.016]  People make those kind of compromises, and I think it's a weakness.
[03:25:41.792 --> 03:25:43.633]  I would give everything I had for this not to go through.
[03:25:43.633 --> 03:25:47.775]  I mean, I don't understand these people that think they get everything by going along.
[03:25:47.775 --> 03:25:52.118]  Don't they get we're entering the endgame where now you lose everything because you went along?
[03:25:52.118 --> 03:25:52.838]  Yeah.
[03:25:52.838 --> 03:26:01.383]  You lose everything in terms of the ultimate spiritual perspective of proving to God that you are a believer in truth and they just are proving that they are not.
[03:26:01.383 --> 03:26:04.325]  They're sealing their own spiritual fate someday in the judgment.
[03:26:04.825 --> 03:26:08.047]  Well, I think people ask, what does it mean to love God and truly be a Christian?
[03:26:08.047 --> 03:26:09.628]  I think it means you love the truth.
[03:26:09.628 --> 03:26:11.750]  Exactly, because God is truth.
[03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:12.810]  God loves truth.
[03:26:12.810 --> 03:26:14.511]  He does not love things which are untrue.
[03:26:14.511 --> 03:26:24.318]  And so you prove your love of God by how much you're attracted to truth, especially uncomfortable truth that goes against your own natural man, natural self.
[03:26:24.318 --> 03:26:27.800]  That's where you prove that you really love truth more than self.
[03:26:29.286 --> 03:26:33.288]  Well, as it gets down to the line, my flesh says, do not keep pushing this, stop, back off.
[03:26:33.288 --> 03:26:35.429]  But I know I'm only going to intensify.
[03:26:35.429 --> 03:26:36.590]  You can't stop, Alex.
[03:26:36.590 --> 03:26:40.592]  This is a mission in life, and it's something that we've got to do and follow through.
[03:26:40.592 --> 03:26:49.196]  But as I say, the goal is to create a remnant of those who believe truth, even difficult truth, and make sure that they'll listen to the Spirit of the Lord as it guides them someday.
[03:26:49.196 --> 03:26:52.418]  And it's a painful realization that we're probably not going to save it.
[03:26:52.418 --> 03:26:57.120]  We're just going to have to create the remnant, because now it's dawning on everybody that
[03:26:58.591 --> 03:27:03.892]  There are throngs of people ready to sell their children to slavery so they can drive a fancy car.
[03:27:03.892 --> 03:27:08.353]  November 8th will be a threshold change in the United States.
[03:27:08.353 --> 03:27:17.835]  As I say, I don't think we'll ever recover the conservative movement after Hillary Clinton becomes president because she will institutionally change this country so significantly.
[03:27:17.835 --> 03:27:20.256]  30 million... And she knows it!
[03:27:20.256 --> 03:27:23.677]  They are in a ritual preparing to finally kill the Republic.
[03:27:23.677 --> 03:27:25.397]  They are drooling.
[03:27:26.257 --> 03:27:27.398]  With the pleasure.
[03:27:27.398 --> 03:27:33.442]  They were intending to have to use the slow Republican way, a controlled Republican, and slowly keep changing people.
[03:27:33.442 --> 03:27:35.463]  Now, they're going to be able to accelerate.
[03:27:35.463 --> 03:27:38.705]  Hillary Clinton will have a mandate to accelerate everything from the Supreme Court.
[03:27:38.705 --> 03:27:41.327]  And down the road, that makes it better for us, but the short term is going to be rough.
[03:27:41.834 --> 03:27:42.835]  It's going to be very, very rough.
[03:27:42.835 --> 03:27:49.220]  But ultimately it'll help us to separate people out, the true believers, from those that are sitting on the fence.
[03:27:49.220 --> 03:27:50.941]  They're going to see there is no fence anymore.
[03:27:50.941 --> 03:27:55.065]  It's either you are for or against this evil government that's forming.
[03:27:55.065 --> 03:27:57.747]  And this global governance that they're shooting us to.
[03:27:57.747 --> 03:27:58.908]  We're going to continue on with calls.
[03:27:58.908 --> 03:27:59.709]  Let's take one right now.
[03:27:59.709 --> 03:28:04.533]  Let's talk to Kristen and then we'll go to Carlos and Billy and Jonathan and Melville and get to everybody.
[03:28:04.533 --> 03:28:05.313]  But Kristen, go ahead.
[03:28:05.313 --> 03:28:05.974]  You're on the air.
[03:28:07.734 --> 03:28:09.695]  Yes, hey, what's up Alex?
[03:28:09.695 --> 03:28:13.616]  It's an honor to be able to speak with you both.
[03:28:13.616 --> 03:28:18.577]  I just wanted to start off saying, awesome interview, awesome show as always.
[03:28:18.577 --> 03:28:26.159]  I love the fact that you guys are, you know, bringing, and you do this all the time Alex, bringing God into all this.
[03:28:26.159 --> 03:28:31.100]  Because, you know, this is, it's not just a physical battle, it's a spiritual battle that we are facing.
[03:28:31.821 --> 03:28:47.115]  And you're like the only person, you know, that I know that, which is why I love you so much, that put the two together, you know, what we're dealing with in this world and physically and the spiritual aspect of all of it.
[03:28:47.115 --> 03:28:51.178]  And it truly, you know, we are, we're living in a great delusion right now.
[03:28:51.178 --> 03:28:58.825]  People's minds are deluded, you know, and the Bible clearly says that there will be a time when the hearts and minds of men will be clouded with a great delusion.
[03:28:59.372 --> 03:29:04.734]  And just like what you guys were just talking about, how we can't understand how some people just can't see the truth.
[03:29:04.734 --> 03:29:10.235]  And I firmly believe that, you know, Satan, there is a delusion covering them.
[03:29:10.235 --> 03:29:15.077]  But I want to start off, I just want to quickly tell you, Alex, I just got my red shirts today.
[03:29:15.077 --> 03:29:17.457]  The red Trump shirts.
[03:29:17.457 --> 03:29:18.518]  Sure, Trump is my president.
[03:29:18.518 --> 03:29:20.578]  So on election day, we can show the real numbers.
[03:29:20.578 --> 03:29:22.319]  And after people know, hey, we know it was stolen.
[03:29:23.456 --> 03:29:24.376]  Exactly.
[03:29:24.376 --> 03:29:26.097]  I got one for me, one for my husband.
[03:29:26.097 --> 03:29:26.557]  I'm so excited.
[03:29:26.557 --> 03:29:26.957]  Well, stay there.
[03:29:26.957 --> 03:29:28.097]  I want you to finish when we come back.
[03:29:28.097 --> 03:29:30.357]  Trump Is My President, available at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:29:30.357 --> 03:29:31.658]  That also helps fund our operation.
[03:29:31.658 --> 03:29:32.858]  It's a limited edition shirt.
[03:29:32.858 --> 03:29:36.339]  The Hillary for President shirt is going to end in 13 and a half days.
[03:29:36.339 --> 03:29:37.719]  We're not going to sell that anymore.
[03:29:37.719 --> 03:29:38.959]  That's available.
[03:29:38.959 --> 03:29:39.919]  But, Christian, stay there.
[03:29:39.919 --> 03:29:42.560]  And I promise to take four or five more calls, finish up with Joel Skousen.
[03:29:42.560 --> 03:29:45.800]  He's going to tape a documentary with us today, so I don't want to wear him out too much.
[03:29:45.800 --> 03:29:48.921]  And then, the last 20 minutes or so, we're going to have Rob Duke come in.
[03:29:50.916 --> 03:29:53.926]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.926 --> 03:29:57.557]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.733 --> 03:30:16.956]  Political science professor Helmut Norpoth has accurately predicted the results of the last five presidential outcomes and he says Trump has this in the bag, asserting that Donald Trump has an 87% chance of defeating Clinton despite Clinton being ahead in the polls.
[03:30:16.956 --> 03:30:24.078]  Now this information is in direct contradiction to nearly every mainstream media poll that suggests Clinton is leading in double digits.
[03:30:24.338 --> 03:30:35.844]  Norpoth's model has correctly predicted the outcome of the popular vote for every election since 1996, including the 2000 race where Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush took the presidency.
[03:30:35.844 --> 03:30:43.128]  He says this of his model, it usually turns out that the candidate who does better in his party's primary beats the other guy who does less well.
[03:30:43.388 --> 03:30:52.919]  Many Trump supporters are now claiming the media's spin that the election result is a foregone conclusion is a trick designed to convince potential voters to stay home on the 8th.
[03:30:52.919 --> 03:30:58.066]  If Norpoth is correct, we will be looking at President Donald J. Trump come January.
[03:30:58.066 --> 03:31:00.649]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for InfoWars.com.

[03:32:04.417 --> 03:32:08.519]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:32:08.519 --> 03:32:11.180]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[03:32:11.180 --> 03:32:14.021]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[03:32:14.021 --> 03:32:19.204]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:32:19.764 --> 03:32:25.947]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:32:25.947 --> 03:32:32.230]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:32:32.230 --> 03:32:34.791]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:32:35.171 --> 03:32:36.332]  We're the solution!
[03:32:36.332 --> 03:32:37.353]  Americans!
[03:32:37.353 --> 03:32:38.834]  Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[03:32:38.834 --> 03:32:44.237]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:32:44.237 --> 03:32:45.958]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:32:45.958 --> 03:32:47.479]  DVDs now available.
[03:32:47.479 --> 03:32:51.382]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:32:51.382 --> 03:32:57.005]  RevelationTheMovie.info Americans need to see this film.
[03:32:57.005 --> 03:33:00.528]  RevelationTheMovie.info Let's fix it!
[03:33:08.936 --> 03:33:10.838]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:10.838 --> 03:33:26.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.391 --> 03:33:31.935]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're taking your phone calls.
[03:33:31.935 --> 03:33:33.196]  Joel Skousen's our guest.
[03:33:33.196 --> 03:33:34.538]  Kristen, we cut you off there.
[03:33:34.538 --> 03:33:36.159]  Let me go back to you right now.
[03:33:36.159 --> 03:33:37.240]  What was the rest of your point?
[03:33:38.436 --> 03:33:47.501]  Yeah, I just, um, before I ask Dr. Skousen my question, I just want to let you know, Alex, like I said, I got my Trump shirt, got my selenium today.
[03:33:47.501 --> 03:33:49.182]  I'm super excited to try that.
[03:33:49.182 --> 03:33:49.602]  Well, thank you.
[03:33:49.602 --> 03:33:50.823]  You're funding the whole operation.
[03:33:50.823 --> 03:33:54.165]  I tend to plug, but the listeners plug and tell their friends and family about the products.
[03:33:54.165 --> 03:34:00.969]  I mean, I set up with selenium because there's this trace, obvious, you know, element that most people are deficient in that's electrochemical in the body.
[03:34:00.969 --> 03:34:04.651]  And I personally get more energy from our selenium than I do from our brain force.
[03:34:05.371 --> 03:34:05.831]  Yes, thank you.
[03:34:05.831 --> 03:34:06.772]  Thank you, Alex, for all you do.
[03:34:34.372 --> 03:34:38.914]  You know, I wanted to let you know too, there's Infowarriors everywhere.
[03:34:38.914 --> 03:34:49.497]  I was just fortunate enough to go to, and it's an awesome sight to behold, fortunate enough to just go to my second Trump rally in Pennsylvania on Friday.
[03:34:49.497 --> 03:34:58.500]  And it was awesome to see all the Infowarriors shirts, you know, all different kinds, Hillary for prison, all the different ones you sell.
[03:34:59.042 --> 03:35:00.043]  Amazing.
[03:35:00.043 --> 03:35:01.584]  And people are asking, where's M4?
[03:35:01.584 --> 03:35:01.984]  Where's M4?
[03:35:01.984 --> 03:35:04.065]  Because we thought we saw you guys.
[03:35:04.065 --> 03:35:06.567]  And you know, it was, it was phenomenal.
[03:35:06.567 --> 03:35:07.967]  So the word is getting out there.
[03:35:07.967 --> 03:35:09.448]  People are hungry for the truth.
[03:35:09.448 --> 03:35:11.149]  They want the truth.
[03:35:11.149 --> 03:35:16.492]  And you know, and you are, you truly are, you know, you and, and Trump, Alex, you are voices.
[03:35:16.492 --> 03:35:17.473]  And we're so thankful.
[03:35:17.473 --> 03:35:21.635]  Listen, I appreciate you guys giving us energy and thanking us and, and, but I'm thanking you.
[03:35:21.635 --> 03:35:21.795]  You!
[03:35:22.878 --> 03:35:25.079]  Kristen, are the power of this broadcast.
[03:35:25.079 --> 03:35:26.060]  That's what's having the big effect.
[03:35:26.060 --> 03:35:30.802]  When they hate us, that's what they hate, is the fact that you're informed, you're involved, you're taking action.
[03:35:30.802 --> 03:35:32.563]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:35:32.563 --> 03:35:36.565]  Now, Joel, I don't want to affect this election because a lot of people respect you.
[03:35:36.565 --> 03:35:38.266]  Clearly, they're getting ready to steal it.
[03:35:38.266 --> 03:35:39.907]  Clearly, that's their plan.
[03:35:39.907 --> 03:35:44.969]  Only a landslide can defeat them, but they're getting ready to say the Russians stole it if they can't steal it from Trump.
[03:35:44.969 --> 03:35:46.930]  So, I think overall, you're right.
[03:35:46.930 --> 03:35:47.591]  They intend to steal it.
[03:35:49.244 --> 03:35:52.065]  Things don't always go the way they want, especially with this Trump phenomenon.
[03:35:52.065 --> 03:36:00.290]  I think it was Diller, the big Democrat billionaire, that said that Trump has this evil magic around him.
[03:36:00.290 --> 03:36:01.390]  Well, I think it's providence.
[03:36:01.390 --> 03:36:02.871]  And you know, God uses imperfect people.
[03:36:02.871 --> 03:36:04.472]  We all are.
[03:36:04.472 --> 03:36:11.135]  But I mean, you know, Trump really, if you watch his full speeches and what he stands for and what he says, I mean, he really doesn't like seeing America get screwed over.
[03:36:11.135 --> 03:36:12.296]  He really is his own person.
[03:36:12.296 --> 03:36:13.416]  No one can advise him.
[03:36:13.416 --> 03:36:14.617]  No one can tell him anything.
[03:36:14.617 --> 03:36:16.058]  And people can say, well, you've said stuff.
[03:36:16.058 --> 03:36:17.398]  And then Trump says it word for word.
[03:36:17.398 --> 03:36:18.459]  Well, that's only because he agreed with it.
[03:36:19.640 --> 03:36:22.963]  Trump's his own person.
[03:36:22.963 --> 03:36:26.266]  I would disagree vehemently that he has a dark spirit around him.
[03:36:26.266 --> 03:36:28.729]  Trump actually has a very benign spirit about him.
[03:36:28.729 --> 03:36:30.330]  I realize he has weaknesses.
[03:36:30.330 --> 03:36:33.133]  He has had some sexual predator tendencies.
[03:36:33.133 --> 03:36:35.355]  But he's actually a pretty nice guy and his wife confirms that.
[03:36:35.355 --> 03:36:36.556]  All of his children confirm that.
[03:36:36.556 --> 03:36:38.538]  This is not a dark spirit.
[03:36:38.538 --> 03:36:40.460]  He's a good man with weaknesses.
[03:36:41.511 --> 03:37:01.701]  But I want to make sure that people realize you've got to get out there and vote, especially people in the state of Utah, for example, which is dealing with Evan McMullin, a CIA plant that Romney is... By the way, I noticed to interrupt, whenever I say this guy's CIA, him last week, or I say Anderson Cooper is, they go, that's crazy, you're nuts, even though they're admittedly CIA.
[03:37:01.701 --> 03:37:04.523]  Again, there's this next level of just totally lying.
[03:37:04.523 --> 03:37:04.743]  Go ahead.
[03:37:05.356 --> 03:37:05.836]  Well, that's right.
[03:37:05.836 --> 03:37:16.064]  Well, Evan McMullin has a plan to try to deny Utahns, or at least to give them an excuse to exercise their moral outrage to vote for someone other than Trump.
[03:37:16.064 --> 03:37:22.208]  But, in fact, it is a ploy to elect Hillary Clinton in a red state, the reddest of all states, in Utah.
[03:37:22.208 --> 03:37:22.869]  It's a joke.
[03:37:22.869 --> 03:37:27.793]  It's a real sad thing, so I would encourage anyone from Utah, you know, forget about the moral outrage.
[03:37:27.793 --> 03:37:29.074]  And let's talk about him at the CIA.
[03:37:29.074 --> 03:37:30.214]  He wasn't just some analyst.
[03:37:30.214 --> 03:37:30.835]  He was in the field.
[03:37:31.075 --> 03:37:37.980]  That's right, he was in the covert side, and you can't be in the covert side without seeing the dark side of government big and up front and center.
[03:37:37.980 --> 03:37:45.365]  Joined the CFR, worked for Goldman Sachs, he was, uh, he can't talk about anything he did in the congressional area because it's supposedly a sequel.
[03:37:45.365 --> 03:37:47.726]  Well, that means it's the dark side of government.
[03:37:47.726 --> 03:37:50.768]  Because there's nothing that you can't talk about in the open side of government.
[03:37:50.768 --> 03:37:54.531]  By the way, I've had family that was in the dark side of that, and they said, they all got out of it.
[03:37:54.531 --> 03:37:55.591]  People say you don't get out, though they do.
[03:37:55.591 --> 03:37:57.052]  They said it was all horrible.
[03:37:57.052 --> 03:38:00.695]  And then I was never told what it was, but it was like they said, worse than you can imagine.
[03:38:01.716 --> 03:38:09.862]  And so, it means running the worst elements, as Brzezinski wrote in his book, The Tentatronic Era, he said, oh, we actually run all the major criminal enterprises to control it.
[03:38:09.862 --> 03:38:15.326]  That's right, they run the mafia, and they allow, you know, they prosecute the mafia just like they prosecute drug dealers, but the U.S.
[03:38:15.326 --> 03:38:16.827]  imports drugs, the U.S.
[03:38:16.827 --> 03:38:17.868]  uses mafia hitmen
[03:38:18.368 --> 03:38:29.776]  They go seamlessly between the CIA hits and mafia hits and things, but they play this good, bad cop routine so that they can tell the American people we're still America, but they're running a dark side.
[03:38:29.776 --> 03:38:36.420]  There's the dark side of the FBI that my father and uncle saw, dark side of the CIA, dark side of the DEA.
[03:38:36.420 --> 03:38:37.601]  Now a lot of your family was FBI.
[03:38:37.601 --> 03:38:39.362]  I mean, what do you think of this whole Comey thing?
[03:38:40.768 --> 03:38:44.571]  I mean, Comey is a political plant put in there, and he should be embarrassed.
[03:38:44.571 --> 03:38:48.393]  I mean, the Bureau is just outraged.
[03:38:48.393 --> 03:38:55.378]  Those that aren't controlled, they're just outraged at the obvious political cover-up for Hillary Clinton in the name of the FBI.
[03:38:55.378 --> 03:38:59.901]  You're going to see a lot of people leave the FBI because of this, especially the agents that were involved.
[03:38:59.901 --> 03:39:01.202]  Which is part of the corruption plan.
[03:39:01.602 --> 03:39:03.063]  Yes, they want to demoralize it.
[03:39:03.063 --> 03:39:03.664]  That's right.
[03:39:03.664 --> 03:39:08.028]  And then the people on the dark side take over more and more of these organizations.
[03:39:08.028 --> 03:39:14.773]  You know, they delight on picking good Christians and Mormons, return missionaries to be in the FBI on the light, white side.
[03:39:14.773 --> 03:39:18.677]  And occasionally they'll get into the dark side, you know, if they become hungry enough for power.
[03:39:18.677 --> 03:39:24.862]  But generally they like these clean-cut people fronting for the legitimate things they do in the CIA and the FBI.
[03:39:24.862 --> 03:39:29.146]  But there's a huge dark side that is now predominating in both of these agencies.
[03:39:32.199 --> 03:39:42.592]  Yeah, I mean, what they admit, a third of the movies that come out are about black people being persecuted to get a race war going, and then the others are all how cool the CIA is, and now it's in your neighborhood watching you.
[03:39:42.592 --> 03:39:48.619]  I mean, you know, keeping up with the Joneses, this new show, and it's just all clear brainwashing.
[03:39:48.619 --> 03:39:50.461]  It's just like, it's crazy.
[03:39:50.461 --> 03:39:51.603]  Why doesn't the public see through it?
[03:39:53.905 --> 03:40:01.268]  Well, once again, it's a matter of, you know, when you listen to the workings of conscience in your mind, you get a nervous feeling when something isn't quite right.
[03:40:01.268 --> 03:40:12.491]  But when you violate conscience regularly, whether it's about nutrition, whether it's about what you watch on television, your actions, the way you treat your children, your wife, when you violate conscience, you become immune to those good and bad signals.
[03:40:12.491 --> 03:40:20.374]  And then you become very, very susceptible to the temptations and the distortions of satanic influence in the mind.
[03:40:20.374 --> 03:40:22.555]  And that's what happens when people slowly corrupt themselves.
[03:40:23.689 --> 03:40:28.691]  I know this, I don't want the blindness that these people that turn themselves over to evil are involved in.
[03:40:28.691 --> 03:40:38.475]  And it's true, even little delusions, you let yourself do something wrong, you think it's no big deal, and then you notice it has all these downside effects in your overall operational capability.
[03:40:38.475 --> 03:40:45.878]  And your ability to sense right and wrong, it gets clouded, it gets hazy, because it's much more easy to get deceived into things.
[03:40:46.414 --> 03:40:50.256]  Yeah, we're going to go to a few final calls here in the turnover to see some of the final news he's got.
[03:40:50.256 --> 03:40:52.798]  I want to tell you about Solutions for Science Solar Generator.
[03:40:52.798 --> 03:40:54.579]  I got one of their units almost 10 years ago.
[03:40:54.579 --> 03:40:55.600]  I got another one last year.
[03:40:55.600 --> 03:40:57.881]  They just keep upgrading the quality of them.
[03:40:57.881 --> 03:41:02.444]  They became a sponsor because I like the unit so much and thought it was so fairly priced.
[03:41:02.444 --> 03:41:03.885]  But they've never had a deal like this.
[03:41:03.885 --> 03:41:05.186]  I don't know how they're doing it.
[03:41:05.866 --> 03:41:09.932]  They've got their top-of-the-line Perfect Power Solar Generator below cost.
[03:41:09.932 --> 03:41:13.317]  This is their top-of-the-line model, the one I use at my home.
[03:41:13.317 --> 03:41:16.942]  It's expandable, so you can make it as powerful as you want to with other units.
[03:41:16.942 --> 03:41:18.044]  Normally around $6,000.
[03:41:18.044 --> 03:41:19.346]  You can now get them for less than $1,500.
[03:41:21.653 --> 03:41:23.054]  Powergridchaos.com.
[03:41:23.054 --> 03:41:24.414]  It's powergridchaos.com.
[03:41:24.414 --> 03:41:25.675]  Get yours before they're gone.
[03:41:25.675 --> 03:41:27.116]  Powergridchaos.com.
[03:41:27.116 --> 03:41:30.698]  And then finally, United States Gold Vault.
[03:41:30.698 --> 03:41:32.719]  They've got these emergency bags of gold and silver.
[03:41:32.719 --> 03:41:36.621]  They've got a lot of other specials too, so be sure to ask them about their full spectrum.
[03:41:36.621 --> 03:41:39.202]  Will you and your family be protected when you have another economic meltdown?
[03:41:39.202 --> 03:41:41.383]  I believe an economic crash is coming.
[03:41:41.383 --> 03:41:42.884]  You should protect yourself with real money.
[03:41:43.544 --> 03:41:45.986]  Do you want to be a victim or do you want to be prepared?
[03:41:45.986 --> 03:41:49.409]  Take action with the company I trust, United States Gold Vault.
[03:41:49.409 --> 03:41:51.390]  Call them today at 844-321-ALEX.
[03:41:51.390 --> 03:41:53.652]  It's based right here in Texas.
[03:41:53.652 --> 03:41:55.694]  That's 844-321-ALEX.
[03:41:55.694 --> 03:42:04.341]  They've created a game-changing gold and silver survival patch filled with physical gold and silver coins that could help safeguard you, but you'll need most of the financial crisis real money on paper.
[03:42:04.781 --> 03:42:05.902]  I wouldn't wait till it's too late.

[03:42:17.053 --> 03:42:17.853]  844-321-ALEX.
[03:42:17.853 --> 03:42:21.597]  And then just in closing, I mentioned the bio-selenium, the bio-true selenium.
[03:42:21.597 --> 03:42:24.620]  It's just the most organic concentrated you can find.
[03:42:24.620 --> 03:42:28.103]  Never, never heat it up with the mustard seed extract.
[03:42:28.103 --> 03:42:28.604]  It's powerful.
[03:42:29.424 --> 03:42:30.245]  Hey guys, hey Alex.
[03:42:30.245 --> 03:42:31.245]  I have to disagree with Joel.
[03:42:31.245 --> 03:42:32.126]  I love Joel.
[03:42:32.126 --> 03:42:32.807]  I love all your work.
[03:42:32.807 --> 03:42:34.608]  Sure, it's okay to disagree.
[03:42:34.608 --> 03:42:35.348]  Go ahead.
[03:42:35.348 --> 03:42:36.529]  But I disagree with you.
[03:42:58.900 --> 03:43:00.301]  On Trump not getting in.
[03:43:00.301 --> 03:43:03.404]  I think he does get in.
[03:43:03.404 --> 03:43:10.671]  If you look at biblical history, which I believe is real history, but you're not taking into account the metaphysical force.
[03:43:10.671 --> 03:43:20.479]  Whenever the children of Israel cried out, God always delivered them through a person that wasn't always necessarily the perfect Christian, like all these Pharisees want to see.
[03:43:21.604 --> 03:43:23.025]  You've got to get out to the polls.
[03:43:23.025 --> 03:43:25.986]  They cannot steal it if God wants to put Trump in.
[03:43:25.986 --> 03:43:29.287]  And if he wants to put Trump in, because God has taken his own poll.
[03:43:29.287 --> 03:43:30.528]  God's looked at this whole... True.
[03:43:30.528 --> 03:43:31.148]  I'll say this.
[03:43:31.148 --> 03:43:31.988]  I'll say this.
[03:43:31.988 --> 03:43:36.570]  We're going with Joel's view on this, the way they're going, what they're preparing the public for is a steal.
[03:43:36.570 --> 03:43:37.211]  But I agree with you.
[03:43:37.211 --> 03:43:38.691]  We've seen them try to steal everything.
[03:43:38.691 --> 03:43:39.732]  He couldn't get the nomination.
[03:43:39.732 --> 03:43:40.992]  Blah, blah, blah.
[03:43:40.992 --> 03:43:42.513]  Everything they've done is blown up in their face.
[03:43:42.513 --> 03:43:44.934]  So this is an epic time to be alive.
[03:43:44.934 --> 03:43:46.114]  Boy, don't hold your breath.
[03:43:46.114 --> 03:43:48.155]  Yeah, I'm hoping you're right, Billy.
[03:43:48.155 --> 03:43:49.396]  I'm not opposed to what you're saying.
[03:43:50.433 --> 03:44:01.723]  Trying to be the realist here and seeing, but you know, God can always intervene and he can change it if it's meant to be and if we're worthy to be saved or at least to delay, I think, what's coming.
[03:44:01.723 --> 03:44:05.526]  And that's the only thing I hold out for Trump is that he will delay that globalist agenda.
[03:44:05.526 --> 03:44:06.006]  Well, I agree.
[03:44:06.006 --> 03:44:08.569]  A lot of Christians say, you know, it's the end of the world so roll over.
[03:44:08.569 --> 03:44:09.790]  It's our job to whip people up.
[03:44:09.790 --> 03:44:16.476]  But regardless, even if you're an atheist, you shouldn't want to go along with a world government, a corrupt system, carbon taxes, all these scams.
[03:44:17.236 --> 03:44:19.078]  And we should want to get a reprieve.
[03:44:19.078 --> 03:44:22.082]  I mean, if Christians really believe it's all going to go to hell, you can't stop it.
[03:44:22.082 --> 03:44:24.484]  Well, what about Jonah and Nineveh?
[03:44:24.484 --> 03:44:30.451]  And what about all the times that a prophet came, warned people, people listened, and then there was a reprieve?
[03:44:32.119 --> 03:44:33.480]  I'm hoping for one, but we'll see.
[03:44:33.480 --> 03:44:39.004]  Yeah, you know I got a lot of my veteran brothers who I serve with who have that same mindset.
[03:44:54.130 --> 03:45:01.357]  You know, and they're like, oh, you know, the country's so corrupt, you know, and it's just so horrible and everything is exposed and naked and we can't do anything about it.
[03:45:01.357 --> 03:45:03.099]  So they're going to steal it for Hillary.
[03:45:03.099 --> 03:45:04.601]  So just sit home.
[03:45:04.601 --> 03:45:05.362]  Bullcrap.
[03:45:05.362 --> 03:45:08.305]  Just to be clear, Joel's not saying that.
[03:45:08.305 --> 03:45:09.546]  He says, get out and vote.
[03:45:09.546 --> 03:45:11.107]  Make them steal it big if they're going to steal it.
[03:45:11.107 --> 03:45:12.749]  Yeah, right, right.
[03:45:12.749 --> 03:45:16.413]  But I'm just saying the mindset you got to have is that, no, you know what?
[03:45:17.146 --> 03:45:21.271]  Us going out and going to the polls and showing that, you know, we support Trump.
[03:45:21.271 --> 03:45:24.816]  It's us showing... And then you meet like-minded people.
[03:45:24.816 --> 03:45:25.777]  Look, he said it.
[03:45:25.777 --> 03:45:33.707]  The Liberty Movement, you know, going back to Barry Goldwater, Joel Skousen, Cleon Skousen, you know, it's 1 tenth of 1 percent on the Richter scale.
[03:45:34.187 --> 03:45:36.870]  And then with, you know, the peak of Ron Paul, it's a three on the Richter scale.
[03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:38.091]  Now it's like a seven.
[03:45:38.091 --> 03:45:40.953]  And it's just, look, we're building something huge.
[03:45:40.953 --> 03:45:43.296]  All the world nationalism is burgeoning.
[03:45:43.296 --> 03:45:48.461]  He's saying don't, don't, don't get discredited or don't lose faith if they steal it.
[03:45:48.461 --> 03:45:51.043]  I think we should, you know, hope for the best, but pray for the worst.
[03:45:51.043 --> 03:45:51.904]  And we're not going away.
[03:45:51.904 --> 03:45:55.167]  The movement's not going to diminish one iota if Trump is defeated.
[03:45:55.167 --> 03:45:56.228]  It's only going to be strengthened.
[03:45:56.784 --> 03:46:03.648]  I'll be honest with you, you know, he gets in, they sidetrack, they sabotage, we don't deliver, that could be the biggest blow.
[03:46:03.648 --> 03:46:05.729]  I'm just going for Trump because it's the right thing to do.
[03:46:05.729 --> 03:46:08.671]  But then, quite frankly folks, I'm not preparing you for loss.
[03:46:08.671 --> 03:46:12.232]  They keep running that hoax, prepare for loss, prepare for loss, they're going to try to steal it.
[03:46:12.232 --> 03:46:14.814]  I mean, Joel's definitely right, they're going to try to steal it, right Billy?
[03:46:16.365 --> 03:46:19.969]  Yeah, of course they're going to try and steal it, but that doesn't trump what God's going to do.
[03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:21.310]  God can do whatever he wants.
[03:46:21.310 --> 03:46:22.852]  He can put anybody in who he wants.
[03:46:22.852 --> 03:46:30.240]  I feel like God has let Obama, he's let all these horrible globalist Bush and all these people before him get into power.
[03:46:30.240 --> 03:46:31.101]  It's been so long.
[03:46:31.101 --> 03:46:32.523]  He's been judging us.
[03:46:32.523 --> 03:46:37.448]  Judgment has been here in the form of our economy, in the form of our foreign policy, our security, the open borders.
[03:46:37.961 --> 03:46:40.464]  Now God's going to show us one good person.
[03:46:40.464 --> 03:46:43.388]  Hey, turn your heart back to God and everybody needs to have a come to Jesus.
[03:46:43.388 --> 03:46:44.289]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:46:44.289 --> 03:46:48.053]  What he's doing in his speeches is irrevocable damage to the New World Order.
[03:46:48.053 --> 03:46:48.834]  Absolutely.
[03:46:48.834 --> 03:46:53.620]  Well, the video we played earlier with all the stuff he's saying, that is like high noon to a vampire.
[03:46:53.620 --> 03:46:57.525]  I mean, that is, that is, they would never allow that if he was under their control.
[03:46:59.281 --> 03:47:13.225]  Well, all I can say, Billy, is that I hope you're right, but as I say, God has let an awful lot of bad things happen in a direction that I still see continuing, so we're going to wait and see what happens, whether or not God intervenes.
[03:47:13.225 --> 03:47:14.525]  Thank you, Billy.
[03:47:14.525 --> 03:47:16.545]  There's no doubt they're getting ready for the steal, though.
[03:47:16.545 --> 03:47:17.906]  But go vote more than ever, folks.
[03:47:17.906 --> 03:47:19.106]  Trump, Trump, Trump.
[03:47:19.106 --> 03:47:23.067]  John in Utah, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:47:23.067 --> 03:47:25.048]  Hey, Joel and Alex, how are you?
[03:47:25.048 --> 03:47:25.448]  Good.
[03:47:25.448 --> 03:47:25.968]  Good, John.
[03:47:27.449 --> 03:47:33.470]  Hey, Joel, you know, one of the neat things is one of your nephews is a good friend of mine, so that's pretty cool.
[03:47:33.470 --> 03:47:34.331]  Small world, go ahead.
[03:47:34.331 --> 03:47:35.731]  Good, good.
[03:47:35.731 --> 03:47:55.996]  Yeah, so you mentioned having accountability on the vote results, and I've developed a website where people can go onto that website, they can put in their vote, and they can do it anonymously, okay?
[03:47:55.996 --> 03:47:56.816]  They put in their
[03:47:57.825 --> 03:47:58.686]  I don't think so.
[03:48:23.675 --> 03:48:30.700]  Yeah, that would only work, John, if you got a big enough sampling that, you know, it could compare with the zip code result of the county.
[03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:39.107]  I'm suggesting, you know, that we demand that each county do an audit of a small percentage, you know, to compare the paper ballot with the computer.
[03:48:39.107 --> 03:48:40.768]  That's a great way to have a computer around the other.
[03:48:40.768 --> 03:48:52.276]  You just have randomly selected a certain number of folks that, I'm sorry, you get a paper ballot, and then that's part of the, you know, state law, and then that's counted, you know, bipartisanly in front of witnesses.
[03:48:53.237 --> 03:48:54.899]  And then you compare the sample.
[03:48:54.899 --> 03:48:59.385]  And what is the website that you're suggesting people do that on, John?
[03:48:59.385 --> 03:49:01.708]  Yeah, we... Yeah, I do have a website.
[03:49:01.708 --> 03:49:03.791]  If you want me to give it over the air... That's what we said, give it.
[03:49:03.791 --> 03:49:05.073]  Yeah, give that to us, please.
[03:49:06.286 --> 03:49:10.688]  Okay, right now it is grassrootsvoice.info.
[03:49:10.688 --> 03:49:12.389]  All right, we'll look into that.
[03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:13.770]  I appreciate you.
[03:49:13.770 --> 03:49:15.310]  You know, I think the biggest thing is exit polls.
[03:49:15.310 --> 03:49:18.852]  The biggest thing is catching people voting multiple times because they keep confusing it.
[03:49:18.852 --> 03:49:20.113]  Oh, voter fraud happens.
[03:49:20.113 --> 03:49:20.873]  It's very rare.
[03:49:20.873 --> 03:49:22.474]  Election fraud's biggest machines.
[03:49:22.474 --> 03:49:28.537]  The Democrats are organizing election fraud in that they're getting huge armies of individuals to be bused around and vote ten times.
[03:49:28.897 --> 03:49:33.721]  That's election fraud via retail voter fraud, and that's where they're going.
[03:49:33.721 --> 03:49:36.143]  We've got enough cases, enough videos exposing that.
[03:49:36.143 --> 03:49:38.525]  It'll put this whole thing into question.
[03:49:38.525 --> 03:49:40.667]  The problem is the Supreme Court's deadlock.
[03:49:40.667 --> 03:49:42.088]  Yeah, it's all incremental though.
[03:49:42.088 --> 03:49:50.716]  It's a little bit of cheating here and there, but ultimately the big gorilla in the room is this computer fraud, because they can change thousands of votes and you'd never know it.
[03:49:50.816 --> 03:49:51.877]  And just dumps them out.
[03:49:51.877 --> 03:50:00.501]  If you're not doing an audit, and an audit even of 1% is going to catch voter fraud, because a computer should make zero errors.
[03:50:00.501 --> 03:50:01.881]  Should make zero errors.
[03:50:01.881 --> 03:50:06.063]  And we've got all the top guys saying, we flip votes, we trash votes.
[03:50:06.063 --> 03:50:10.445]  Same way they on the phone, where they call you up with a poll, oh hit this button if you like Trump, this if you don't like Hillary.
[03:50:10.445 --> 03:50:12.966]  And when you hit Trump, it hangs up.
[03:50:12.966 --> 03:50:14.087]  This is what they're doing folks.
[03:50:14.087 --> 03:50:18.189]  So, again though, are people more awake to the Federal Reserve being private than they were 10 years ago?
[03:50:18.189 --> 03:50:18.349]  Yes.
[03:50:18.829 --> 03:50:20.110]  People more awake to election fraud now?
[03:50:20.110 --> 03:50:20.330]  Yes.
[03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:22.331]  Are they awake to the Brexit and TPP?
[03:50:22.331 --> 03:50:22.711]  Yes.
[03:50:22.711 --> 03:50:28.354]  That's why I'm just saying, good positive things are happening, but as we approach this line, it's an amazing time.
[03:50:28.354 --> 03:50:29.735]  They've almost been on the air two hours.
[03:50:29.735 --> 03:50:30.655]  I want you to get some rest.
[03:50:30.655 --> 03:50:34.738]  We've got hours of interviews with you today for a special project we're working on.
[03:50:34.738 --> 03:50:36.098]  Joel Skousen, thank you so much.
[03:50:36.098 --> 03:50:36.699]  My pleasure, Alex.
[03:50:36.699 --> 03:50:37.359]  It's always a pleasure.
[03:50:37.359 --> 03:50:37.739]  Thank you.

[03:50:50.330 --> 03:50:53.032]  We're going to have a little pop-in with the news director here.
[03:50:53.032 --> 03:50:56.035]  Let's come up with the nightly news straight ahead.
[03:50:56.035 --> 03:50:57.336]  Rob Dew on the other side of this break.
[03:50:57.336 --> 03:50:58.998]  And then back tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:51:02.310 --> 03:51:10.378]  ExtendoVite, a 7-herb combination of garlic, cayenne, hawthorn, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, valerian and milk thistle.
[03:51:10.378 --> 03:51:16.164]  ExtendoVite is designed to strengthen the heart and arteries and help the body heal itself.
[03:51:16.164 --> 03:51:21.549]  Doctors are not able to explain the improvements they are seeing in their patients' health who are taking ExtendoVite.
[03:51:22.170 --> 03:51:26.892]  People who once needed more pills are now taking less and getting better.
[03:51:26.892 --> 03:51:34.616]  Due to the unexplainable improvements in their patient's health, more doctors are calling to order Extend-A-Vite for themselves.
[03:51:34.616 --> 03:51:37.297]  Help Extend-A-Vite make your doctor a believer.

[03:52:01.485 --> 03:52:02.466]  Reality check.
[03:52:02.466 --> 03:52:03.326]  Rampant hacking.
[03:52:03.326 --> 03:52:04.127]  Identity theft.
[03:52:04.127 --> 03:52:04.987]  Mass surveillance.
[03:52:04.987 --> 03:52:07.008]  Defending yourself today is not an option.
[03:52:07.008 --> 03:52:07.949]  It's a requirement.

[03:53:01.806 --> 03:53:03.287]  My name is Liam, I'm 41.
[03:53:03.287 --> 03:53:06.149]  I've been using One World Way for two and a half years now.
[03:53:06.149 --> 03:53:18.359]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc from a car accident three years ago, and since that time I've been unable to walk long distances, do any minor lifting or just normal activities with my children without having severe back pain.
[03:53:18.359 --> 03:53:24.464]  Since I've started using One World Way, I've been able to walk more, engage in activities with my children, and have less lower back pain.
[03:53:24.944 --> 03:53:29.368]  One World Whey has helped me regain back my strength, confidence, and have a healthier life.
[03:53:29.368 --> 03:53:35.192]  I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds, my A1c dropped 2 points, and I have more energy now.
[03:53:35.192 --> 03:53:37.834]  One World Whey has helped me regain back my life.
[03:53:37.834 --> 03:53:44.639]  The results for clients on One World Whey have surpassed the results for most any other supplements as well as all other whey protein powders.
[03:53:44.639 --> 03:53:47.261]  One World Whey is non-denatured and frequency encoded.
[03:53:47.441 --> 03:53:47.962]  We're good to go.
[03:54:23.778 --> 03:54:25.779]  Welcome back to our final segment of the fourth hour.
[03:54:25.779 --> 03:54:29.142]  This is Rob Due, News Director for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:54:29.142 --> 03:54:35.827]  Tonight we're going to have David Knight's going to talk about the results of an investigation he's been doing on voter fraud going on here in Texas.
[03:54:35.827 --> 03:54:38.489]  You're going to want to tune in for that 7 p.m.
[03:54:38.489 --> 03:54:44.534]  Central at InfoWars.com forward slash show or on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:54:44.534 --> 03:54:45.835]  Now, this just came out.
[03:54:45.835 --> 03:54:52.361]  WikiLeaks lists at least 65 MSM reporters are meeting with and or coordinating offline with top Hillary Clinton advisers.
[03:54:53.385 --> 03:54:55.614]  And there's literally 65 people here.
[03:54:57.895 --> 03:55:00.175]  These are some reporters that RSVP'd to an event.
[03:55:00.175 --> 03:55:03.936]  You got ABC, Cecilia Vega, David Muir, Diane Sawyer.
[03:55:03.936 --> 03:55:05.276]  No surprise there.
[03:55:05.276 --> 03:55:07.537]  George Stephanopoulos, John Carl.
[03:55:07.537 --> 03:55:10.777]  From Bloomberg, John Heilman, Mark Halperin.
[03:55:10.777 --> 03:55:13.498]  From CBS, Nora O'Donald, Vicky Gordon.
[03:55:13.498 --> 03:55:24.040]  From CNN, Brianna Keller, David Shalayan, Gloria Borger, Jeff Zeleny, John Berman, Kate Bolden, Mark Preston, Sam Feist.
[03:55:24.040 --> 03:55:26.160]  From the Daily Beast, Jackie Kucinich.
[03:55:27.262 --> 03:55:32.724]  From GPG, Mike Feldman, Huffington Post, Whitney Schneider.
[03:55:32.724 --> 03:55:34.744]  From Moore, Betsy Martin.
[03:55:34.744 --> 03:55:41.726]  From MSNBC, Alex Wagner, Beth Fui, Phil Griffin, Rachel Maddow, Rachel Racusen.
[03:55:41.726 --> 03:55:43.887]  From NBC, Stephanie Guthrie.
[03:55:43.887 --> 03:55:46.548]  From the New Yorker, Ryan Leza.
[03:55:46.548 --> 03:55:52.890]  From the New York Times, Amy Chozik, Gail Collins, Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman.
[03:55:53.709 --> 03:55:54.530]  And Pat Healy.
[03:55:54.530 --> 03:55:58.613]  And from People, Sonia Westphal, Politico, Glenn Thrush, and Mike Allen.
[03:55:58.613 --> 03:56:04.018]  Interestingly enough, Glenn Thrush is also profiled in this article here from The Observer.
[03:56:04.018 --> 03:56:08.282]  No consequences for media peers from reporters caught colluding with Hillary.
[03:56:08.282 --> 03:56:09.783]  So it's no big deal.
[03:56:09.783 --> 03:56:10.664]  And you can read the rest of this.
[03:56:10.664 --> 03:56:11.565]  This is on Gateway Pundit.
[03:56:11.565 --> 03:56:16.609]  And then there's another list here of people who went to a dinner at John Podesta's house where he cooked them lobster bisque.
[03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:19.211]  And, uh, very interesting.
[03:56:19.211 --> 03:56:24.274]  So, nothing being rigged there, even though Donald Trump came out and said it was being rigged and everybody laughed at him.
[03:56:24.274 --> 03:56:27.615]  The same people that are laughing at him are in this list right here.
[03:56:27.615 --> 03:56:28.696]  Here's an article.
[03:56:28.696 --> 03:56:31.998]  Concern grows over Soros-linked voting machines.
[03:56:31.998 --> 03:56:35.659]  So the UK-based Smartmatic has actually got voting machines in 16 states.
[03:56:37.220 --> 03:56:40.923]  And if you watch the report that's on our YouTube channel, it's the main one listed right now.
[03:56:40.923 --> 03:56:45.025]  It's called, This Video Proves Donald Trump Is Right About Election Fraud.
[03:56:45.025 --> 03:56:58.134]  It talks about all the instances in the last elections where Al Gore, who else was in there, John Kerry, all these guys were lamenting about how their votes weren't being cast right.
[03:56:58.134 --> 03:57:06.720]  And they even did studies where they went and looked at counties that were predominantly Democrats, especially in Florida, and they were getting majority Republican totals from the voting machines.
[03:57:07.220 --> 03:57:09.642]  So there's definitely chicanery going on in Florida.
[03:57:09.642 --> 03:57:13.605]  Then they switched it in 2004 to Ohio.
[03:57:13.605 --> 03:57:15.346]  And so Ohio is a big battleground state.
[03:57:15.346 --> 03:57:21.931]  In fact, we got a video coming up from one of our reporters, Millie Weaver, where she went to a Hillary and a Trump rally.
[03:57:21.931 --> 03:57:25.634]  It's going to be coming up later tonight, hopefully, or early tomorrow.
[03:57:25.634 --> 03:57:27.996]  In Cleveland, Trump rally, 30,000 people.
[03:57:27.996 --> 03:57:29.597]  Hillary rally, maybe four, maybe 500.
[03:57:30.965 --> 03:57:33.467]  Okay, so the fix is definitely in.
[03:57:33.467 --> 03:57:36.349]  We've got the article out on Infowars.com.
[03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:39.391]  Hillary personally ordered Donald Duck to troll Trump events.
[03:57:39.391 --> 03:57:42.894]  We got the video there from Project Veritas along with the article.
[03:57:42.894 --> 03:57:52.301]  Just talking about how she came up with the idea about Donald Duck and wanted this and she ordered that, sorry guys, she ordered that specifically to come out and have people dressed as Donald Duck.
[03:57:52.301 --> 03:57:58.065]  We actually even had a guy dressed in a duck suit at a, at a, during the primaries, Super Tuesday.
[03:57:58.846 --> 03:58:01.467]  But here you have an actual Donald Duck out there.
[03:58:01.467 --> 03:58:03.728]  I couldn't figure out why he had that.
[03:58:03.728 --> 03:58:05.329]  James O'Keefe had that on his board behind him.
[03:58:05.329 --> 03:58:06.530]  I'm like, Donald Duck, I don't get it.
[03:58:06.530 --> 03:58:07.310]  I don't get it.
[03:58:07.310 --> 03:58:07.970]  But there it is.
[03:58:07.970 --> 03:58:10.091]  She ordered Donald Duck to be out there.
[03:58:10.091 --> 03:58:12.993]  Donald Duck's releasing his tax returns.
[03:58:12.993 --> 03:58:15.594]  But we can't ask about her emails.
[03:58:15.594 --> 03:58:19.476]  So that is typical Republican chicanery for you right there.
