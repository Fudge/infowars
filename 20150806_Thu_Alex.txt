[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.860]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.860 --> 00:34.080]  show on this Thursday August 6, 2015 of course tonight is the beginning of the
[00:34.080 --> 00:38.500]  debates we'll have the first one eagerly awaited everybody is curious to see
[00:38.500 --> 00:44.440]  what's going to happen as one of John Kasich's advisors said when talking
[00:44.440 --> 00:47.440]  about the possibility what might happen tonight everybody's concerned they don't
[00:47.440 --> 00:50.500]  know what Donald Trump is going to do and one guy said well it's kind of like
[00:50.500 --> 00:53.600]  trying to prepare for a NASCAR race when you know one of the drivers is going to
[00:53.600 --> 00:58.000]  be drunk well I don't think Donald Trump is going to be drunk I think he's going
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.680]  to surprise them with his passion a lot of people are interested to see them get
[01:02.680 --> 01:06.600]  off of their set talking points we've seen this happen over and over again you
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.680]  know that if they're a governor they're going to talk about how they lower taxes
[01:09.680 --> 01:13.440]  and they created jobs more jobs than anybody has ever created in history
[01:13.440 --> 01:17.840]  mankind and they did it all themselves as governor if they're a senator they're
[01:17.840 --> 01:21.040]  typically going to talk about how sophisticated they are about foreign
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.320]  policy how they've supported every war have they built the military to a giant
[01:25.320 --> 01:29.480]  level we're going to talk about that because unfortunately probably not
[01:29.480 --> 01:32.480]  going to hear even from Rand Paul and he pushed back against building the
[01:32.480 --> 01:39.760]  military tonight Rand Paul has has been the least belligerent the least
[01:39.760 --> 01:43.320]  interventionist by far of all the candidates so much so they've got a
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.040]  political pack that is going to be attacking him they've set up that pack
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.440]  just to attack Rand Paul but he still wants to grow the defense budget he
[01:51.440 --> 01:55.200]  wants to offset it with cuts elsewhere unlike many of the other candidates but
[01:55.200 --> 01:59.240]  he still wants to grow it we're going to talk about where this is all leading
[01:59.240 --> 02:04.440]  today is the 70th anniversary of dropping the bomb on Hiroshima we're going to
[02:04.440 --> 02:06.560]  look at this from a different perspective we're not going to talk about the
[02:06.560 --> 02:10.280]  politics of it we're not going to talk about the military strategy of it we're
[02:10.280 --> 02:15.760]  going to talk about it from the ground level from some of the surviving eyewitnesses
[02:15.760 --> 02:21.080]  what did they see and what do we expect to see with all the money that we're
[02:21.080 --> 02:24.880]  pouring into the military industrial complex so we're going to talk about
[02:24.880 --> 02:29.960]  that when we come back also we're going to talk about the newest movements to
[02:29.960 --> 02:33.280]  attack the right to keep and bear arms of course we had this theater shooting
[02:33.280 --> 02:36.840]  yesterday and everybody said this is terrible you know the only person
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.440]  shooting the only people shooting really was the police purportedly this guy
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.280]  who had a pellet gun pointed it maybe took a couple of shots at somebody who's
[02:46.280 --> 02:50.240]  a disturbed individual of course they're not going to blame Hollywood for a
[02:50.240 --> 02:55.320]  cosplay gone wrong which is what it looks like to me as the facts are
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.080]  starting to come in this guy was a disturbed individual it's still not
[02:59.080 --> 03:02.880]  certain that he's been committed four times it's still not certain if that was
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.600]  recent or if it was as long ago as 2007 that'd be eight years ago
[03:07.600 --> 03:11.520]  nevertheless they're not going to blame Hollywood for inspiring this they're
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.520]  not going to say that everybody freaked out and called the cops who then came
[03:16.520 --> 03:21.200]  in and started shooting when he pointed his gun perhaps he was mentally
[03:21.200 --> 03:25.960]  disturbed he was homeless if he if he pointed a pellet gun at a cop the cop
[03:25.960 --> 03:32.080]  is justified to shoot him but at that point all pandemonium broke out and it
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.600]  was over so we're going to talk about what happened with that but there's a
[03:34.600 --> 03:41.880]  surprising article up from Panama they said that they are going to open up gun
[03:41.880 --> 03:45.600]  imports into the country this is what their public safety minister wants to
[03:45.600 --> 03:49.120]  do he's taken a look at the statistics that we've been talking about here at
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.960]  info wars for quite some time saying that the increased gun ownership has
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.760]  decreased crime and he says we got a crime wave here we need to bring in more
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.920]  firearms but at the same time we have conservative Texas Senator Cornyn
[04:05.920 --> 04:13.080]  joining with the NRA trying to increase background checks for people who are
[04:13.080 --> 04:18.840]  nuts like this guy at the theater yesterday you know the the right to
[04:18.840 --> 04:22.880]  keep and bear arms is a fundamental right and you don't make it better by
[04:22.880 --> 04:26.520]  making it more difficult for the vast majority of people in a society who are
[04:26.520 --> 04:31.560]  saying to exercise that fundamental right we're going to talk about that we're
[04:31.560 --> 04:34.640]  going to talk about new revelations and Planned Parenthood we're going to talk
[04:34.640 --> 04:37.760]  about some health news we haven't talked about health news last couple of days
[04:37.760 --> 04:43.240]  I've had a story about one guy's patent that would use mushrooms to replace
[04:43.240 --> 05:01.840]  Monsanto stay with us we'll be right back the next financial crash it was said
[05:01.840 --> 05:06.600]  that after the last financial crash that no one could have seen it coming well
[05:06.600 --> 05:11.880]  this was not true back then and it is not true today if you were looking for the
[05:11.880 --> 05:18.160]  truth in 2007 the average investor had ample warning from many sources of what
[05:18.160 --> 05:23.720]  was to come for several years and in particular the last 12 months the IMF
[05:23.720 --> 05:28.600]  and the Bank for International Settlements have been issuing warning
[05:28.600 --> 05:35.680]  after warning in July of 2015 the IMF warned that pension funds could pose a
[05:35.680 --> 05:41.000]  systematic risk in June of this year the UK Telegraph ran an article that said
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.400]  the world is defenseless against the next financial crisis after a warning from
[05:46.400 --> 05:52.360]  the Bank of International Settlements the BIS is the central bank for central

[08:45.680 --> 08:49.320]  talking about vaccines that will play for you before Jim Mars gets here as
[08:49.320 --> 08:55.520]  well course tonight is the first of the big debates they had a debate on Monday
[08:55.520 --> 09:00.600]  night in New Hampshire wasn't very interesting it showed just how stifled
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.920]  and boring it can become when the Republican National Party dictates the
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.280]  rules avoids any kind of debate because they don't want a discussion they want
[09:10.280 --> 09:14.880]  a beauty contest it just but tonight's going to be different tonight's going to
[09:14.880 --> 09:17.640]  be different they're all concerned about what's going to happen when Donald
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.960]  Trump gets there and he doesn't play by the nice polite rules that they've
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.520]  imposed on political discussion in this country I think that's one of the big
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.800]  things of passion that he has and of course his contempt for political
[09:29.800 --> 09:35.360]  correctness I think we saw that with Jeremy Clarkson Top Gear in the UK of
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.800]  course that was what got him pushed out by the BBC even though he had by far and
[09:39.800 --> 09:45.840]  away the largest program on the BBC the most profitable aspect of the BBC over
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.520]  five million viewers of each episode it was huge for the BBC but they pushed him
[09:50.520 --> 09:55.760]  out because he mocked and laughed at their political correctness of course
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.680]  now he's going to have a program based in the United States on Amazon I think
[10:00.680 --> 10:04.280]  that's what is really appealing to most people about Donald Trump is the
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.640]  frankness to not shy away from these issues and really a passion that you
[10:09.640 --> 10:14.400]  can see in the debates in the British Parliament that we don't have here we
[10:14.400 --> 10:18.840]  have people stand up and read prepared speeches and it's not because they can't
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.560]  think it's because most of them have imposed upon them by the leadership
[10:23.560 --> 10:29.920]  these rules of politeness we saw how they pushed back or in hatch Mitch McConnell
[10:29.920 --> 10:34.360]  and others pushed back and censored Ted Cruz I don't think censored is the
[10:34.360 --> 10:37.760]  official there that's an official action they didn't do that but they they called
[10:37.760 --> 10:41.040]  him out on the floor of the Senate because he pointed out that Mitch
[10:41.040 --> 10:46.600]  McConnell had lied when he was pushing through the trans-Pacific partnership he
[10:46.600 --> 10:50.920]  was concerned about the export import bank Ted Cruz was he wasn't concerned
[10:50.920 --> 10:55.520]  about the secretiveness of the trans-Pacific partnership or the transatlantic
[10:55.520 --> 11:01.960]  partnership he wasn't concerned about turning over all of the responsibilities
[11:01.960 --> 11:06.320]  of our legislature to pass laws he wasn't concerned about the transnational
[11:06.320 --> 11:10.720]  governance aspect of it he was concerned about the export import bank and other
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.360]  things like that that I think were were trivial and of course he voted for it the
[11:14.360 --> 11:19.160]  first time through he knew that it wasn't going to he had the ability to
[11:19.160 --> 11:22.360]  vote against it the second time so I think that his second vote was purely
[11:22.360 --> 11:30.720]  political we're also going to talk about what's going on with with the shooting
[11:30.720 --> 11:35.360]  at the theater yesterday and I want to do that right now you know this is a
[11:35.360 --> 11:40.320]  situation where we see a guy go into a movie Mad Max he's dressed up in costume
[11:40.320 --> 11:45.520]  he's got a little toy axe he's got a pellet gun he probably looked pretty
[11:45.520 --> 11:50.840]  crazy as well initial reports said he was 51 then 47 then now they're settled
[11:50.840 --> 11:54.920]  on I think 29 is his age he's somebody who has a history of mental illness he's
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.640]  been committed four times I've seen various reports some of them said that
[11:58.640 --> 12:01.960]  it was within the last year some of them said that it's been as long ago as
[12:01.960 --> 12:06.600]  2007 nevertheless what this looks like to me is somebody who's probably a
[12:06.600 --> 12:10.920]  little bit mentally deranged he's homeless he's got the money to go to this
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.760]  movie he gets into this cosplay thing and because he's got a pellet gun he
[12:15.760 --> 12:19.760]  points it at a cop when the shooting starts he pulls out some pepper spray
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.000]  and then all pandemonium breaks out everybody believes they're under attack
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.320]  nobody was hurt in this except for this guy and he was shot dead by the cops
[12:29.320 --> 12:32.840]  here's how the story breaks down they say that he entered with pepper spray and
[12:32.840 --> 12:37.120]  airsoft and airsoft pellet gun it's not even a real parallel again airsoft if
[12:37.120 --> 12:43.560]  you don't know a little plastic like BBs they have absolutely no mass you can
[12:43.560 --> 12:47.880]  shoot that at close range with each other my boys used to play with airsoft
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.120]  all the time and an axe now the axe if you see in a picture the axe you know it
[12:52.120 --> 12:56.760]  doesn't have an edge on it either so he goes in dressed up from Mad Max
[12:56.760 --> 13:01.000]  theatergoers and the audience something happens and they were concerned about it
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.040]  they ran out they alerted police officers who responded to who were
[13:05.040 --> 13:08.400]  responding to a vehicle crash nearby and I don't know but I'm looking at this
[13:08.400 --> 13:12.360]  and thinking you know they might have just seen this guy and been concerned
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.200]  that he was going to do something because they saw an airsoft pistol in his
[13:16.200 --> 13:19.640]  pocket and he's dressed kind of weird and cosplay and they might have gone out
[13:19.640 --> 13:24.440]  and pulled the cops in and then at that point when the cop enters he pulls
[13:24.440 --> 13:30.760]  points his pellet gun at the officer and pulls the trigger shooting a massless
[13:30.760 --> 13:37.600]  little plastic bubble at him the cop then fired one round from his patrol rifle
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.760]  and self-defense and backed out and got the SWAT team at that point Montanto
[13:42.760 --> 13:48.320]  Montano the guy who they the perpetrator began to use the pepper spray
[13:48.320 --> 13:52.280]  officer said they encountered a cloud of pepper spray when they entered to take
[13:52.280 --> 13:56.720]  him into custody he attempted to run out of the back door of the theater and as
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.440]  he emerged with his toy axe in his hand and started toward the officers five of
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.400]  them open fire and killed him now here's what happened in the theater one man
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.240]  was cut on the shoulder it was minor evidently brushed against the axe the
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.560]  guy was carrying they say his man the man his wife and his daughter were
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.200]  treated for pepper spray and in this particular article by AP they say that
[14:19.200 --> 14:25.640]  he was committed twice in 2004 twice in 2007 now who's to blame here's it's a
[14:25.640 --> 14:31.080]  tragedy I think it was overreaction by some people in the theater they got the
[14:31.080 --> 14:35.440]  police to come in there when he points the airsoft pistol at him then that's it
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.040]  they think they've got a live shooter and at that point this mentally disturbed
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.760]  man and it is mentally disturbed to point a pistol at a cop today and even if
[14:44.760 --> 14:48.400]  it's a toy gun you know you're gonna get killed that's the way they they roll
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.080]  today nevertheless who's to blame is it Hollywood no Hollywood's not getting any
[14:52.080 --> 14:57.240]  criticism for inspiring somebody to dress up with a toy pistol and a an axe
[14:57.240 --> 15:01.600]  and go watch the movie I've seen this kind of stuff since the 1980s I remember
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.440]  when the first Conan the barbarian movie came out with Arnold Schwarzenegger we
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.680]  made the mistake of going to see it and there were all these people dressed up
[15:08.680 --> 15:13.760]  in these Conan so first time I'd seen any kind of cosplay like that it was but
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.560]  nevertheless is Hollywood to blame no are we gonna blame the hatchet no are we
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.280]  going to blame the pepper spray no are we going to blame the airsoft gun yes
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.560]  yes we will blame that we will not blame the psychiatric evaluation we will
[15:25.560 --> 15:31.720]  blame the airsoft gun but we will take a look at the psychiatric evaluations and
[15:31.720 --> 15:38.120]  maybe we'll have our conservative Texas senator senator John Cornyn join with
[15:38.120 --> 15:43.960]  the NRA to say we need to have more background checks and information don't
[15:43.960 --> 15:48.520]  worry it won't be a requirement we'll just offer incentives to states to
[15:48.520 --> 15:55.000]  reward them on snooping on everybody look it's not a case of people like this
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.320]  guy who went to the movie theater it's really more and we've seen this over and
[15:58.320 --> 16:02.560]  over again they are targeting their angling to go after the veterans to
[16:02.560 --> 16:06.920]  take away their guns they want to make everybody look like they're lunatic they
[16:06.920 --> 16:11.080]  want to find some justification take away the veterans guns they want to find a
[16:11.080 --> 16:14.680]  justification take away people's guns who are on social security by merely
[16:14.680 --> 16:17.520]  saying if you have an automatic deposit of your check that means that you're
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.760]  financially incompetent therefore you're not competent to own a gun that's the
[16:21.760 --> 16:28.960]  kind of logic and now we see the NRA and senator John Cornyn from Texas pushing
[16:28.960 --> 16:34.240]  to do more federal background checks listen second amendment says our
[16:34.240 --> 16:39.440]  fundamental human rights shall not be infringed and that includes infringement
[16:39.440 --> 16:45.520]  by the NRA by conservative so-called senators on the other hand look at what
[16:45.520 --> 16:50.680]  Panama is doing Panama is lifting a ban on gun imports amidst a rising crime
[16:50.680 --> 16:54.840]  wave they say more firearms will mean fewer home homicides that's their
[16:54.840 --> 16:59.440]  public safety minister Aguilera this is what he says he says everything seems
[16:59.440 --> 17:02.720]  to indicate that there's no direct correlation in the aphorism that says
[17:02.720 --> 17:09.040]  more crime guns mean more crime he said that relaxed gun laws have allowed the
[17:09.040 --> 17:12.040]  United States to reduce the homicide rate over the last 20 years that's what
[17:12.040 --> 17:15.480]  we've been telling people that's what the FBI has been telling people you can
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.240]  look at the figures and you can understand that look at the data you can
[17:20.240 --> 17:26.080]  see the trend happening less gun laws more ownership in an area it's not only
[17:26.080 --> 17:30.400]  nationally but it is region by region where do you have the most shootings and
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.320]  the gun-free areas where do you have the most killings in the areas like Chicago
[17:34.320 --> 17:39.300]  where they try to control guns they can't control guns it's a means of people
[17:39.300 --> 17:45.560]  control they say under current law in effect since 2012 only Panama state
[17:45.560 --> 17:50.400]  security forces can import firearms now on the other side we have this
[17:50.400 --> 17:56.800]  organization SICA's Central American program of small arms control does that
[17:56.800 --> 18:00.720]  sound like something from the UN yeah because that's their agenda that they're
[18:00.720 --> 18:05.160]  doing and the person who works for them the director of that organization says
[18:05.160 --> 18:07.800]  it's a decision for each sovereign government to make but we would take
[18:07.800 --> 18:11.520]  into account that for criminals anything that's prohibited becomes more
[18:11.520 --> 18:16.200]  attractive hmm yeah that's true that's one of the reasons why prohibition
[18:16.200 --> 18:21.920]  doesn't work they go on to say there is no registry of firearms that come in
[18:21.920 --> 18:27.920]  much less exact data of how many we have this is another minister of the
[18:27.920 --> 18:31.520]  Panamanian government he says illegal weapons trafficking does not generate
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.320]  as much profit as drugs but it does threaten citizen security so let me ask
[18:36.320 --> 18:42.160]  him how well is that prohibition doing at stopping the flow of drugs or stopping
[18:42.160 --> 18:47.760]  the flow of guns see prohibition in a black market like that where people
[18:47.760 --> 18:50.440]  know that they need something and they do know that they need to be able to
[18:50.440 --> 18:54.920]  protect themselves but when they want something like drugs or they want
[18:54.920 --> 19:00.680]  something like alcohol prohibition simply makes things more lethal we've
[19:00.680 --> 19:05.080]  seen that it adds to corruption we've seen that and it doesn't stop it we've
[19:05.080 --> 19:09.160]  seen that and so it's not stopping there last thing on this story he says in
[19:09.160 --> 19:13.800]  2012 the United Nations office on drugs and crime estimated that an average of
[19:13.800 --> 19:18.760]  700,000 firearms circulated through Panama's streets now understand that is
[19:18.760 --> 19:23.560]  where this is all coming from this is all coming from the UN that's their
[19:23.560 --> 19:28.880]  agenda to try to stop all small firearms to try to do worldwide gun
[19:28.880 --> 19:33.640]  control by stopping the flow of arms across borders that's what the UN arms
[19:33.640 --> 19:37.040]  trade treaty is about that's what they've been feeding this with and that's
[19:37.040 --> 19:41.880]  why they were doing fast and furious they wanted to make a case to push the
[19:41.880 --> 19:46.720]  UN arms trade treaty through of course John Kerry signed it anyway but it is
[19:46.720 --> 19:50.280]  still not in effect we'll see what they do they don't necessarily need to have
[19:50.280 --> 19:54.840]  a law and we'll talk about that when we come back stay with us
[19:58.160 --> 20:02.880]  in recent years we have witnessed the most catastrophic disasters in history

[24:09.880 --> 24:13.520]  welcome back to the Alex Jones Show I'm David Knight your host we're going to
[24:13.520 --> 24:17.920]  have a special report in the next section a follow-up from Alex's report on
[24:17.920 --> 24:21.880]  operation chaos and of course Alex Jones is in Europe investigating the
[24:21.880 --> 24:25.440]  globalist takeover that is happening there we're gonna talk about a couple of
[24:25.440 --> 24:30.040]  different aspects of that in this section of the broadcast we're gonna talk
[24:30.040 --> 24:34.160]  about some economics as well as the immigration issue and of course that's
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.560]  a key part of what he was talking about with operation chaos before we get back
[24:38.560 --> 24:41.480]  to the news however I just want to let you know that we have a new flash sale
[24:41.480 --> 24:45.840]  today we have a 24-hour sale we've been doing this last several days this is a
[24:45.840 --> 24:51.840]  24-hour sale on occupower today we're offering 30% off of occupower that'll
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.600]  last for 24 hours again occupower specifically designed to nutritionally
[24:56.600 --> 25:01.320]  assist the natural function of healthy eyes I've done reports in the past for a
[25:01.320 --> 25:07.680]  group called AMD they work with age-related macular degeneration your
[25:07.680 --> 25:13.800]  eyes are constantly replacing the cells in your retina it's one of the places
[25:13.800 --> 25:17.880]  where nutrition is so incredibly important and one of the few things that
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.480]  they found that really does help to control and to prevent age-related
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.160]  macular degeneration which begins with a blind spot in the center of your eye and
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.320]  then gets gets worse and worse and it can get worse very rapidly the only
[25:30.320 --> 25:35.320]  thing they found that really works for that is nutrition I have an aunt who is
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.360]  still alive she's 91 and I remember years ago she started having macular
[25:39.360 --> 25:43.520]  degeneration it was early stages of it she started taking a lot of
[25:43.520 --> 25:49.440]  nutrients that were designed specifically to for the eye and she
[25:49.440 --> 25:56.240]  basically reversed itself for her she's now 91 and she just stopped driving not
[25:56.240 --> 25:59.680]  necessarily because of her eyes but because of other things again with
[25:59.680 --> 26:04.280]  occupower it has essential natural nutrients things like a taxathon

[26:34.680 --> 26:41.160]  Alex is going to be having a report from from Italy a follow-up to operation
[26:41.160 --> 26:44.960]  chaos we're going to have that in the next section today this news a euro
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.560]  group of bankers is calling for economic government quote-unquote this is on
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.640]  info wars.com they say they want more taxes levied on citizens but really
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.160]  what they're doing is they're trying to use these economic situations the
[26:58.160 --> 27:01.920]  economic collapse the indebtedness of Greece and other countries they're
[27:01.920 --> 27:06.880]  using that to push for greater control greater sovereignty and we've seen
[27:06.880 --> 27:10.440]  Greenspan Alan Greenspan former head of the Federal Reserve say the only way
[27:10.440 --> 27:14.560]  that you're going to solve this crisis in Greece and the other countries that
[27:14.560 --> 27:18.600]  are lined up to have this crisis is to surrender sovereignty we saw the head of
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.760]  Pemko the largest bond company say the same thing and now we have Francois
[27:23.760 --> 27:28.800]  Hollanda France's socialist president calling for a separate economic
[27:28.800 --> 27:34.480]  government to lord over the monetary union as reported by Derspiegel and what
[27:34.480 --> 27:37.800]  they're saying is that it's not only him of course now we have the French
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.520]  Prime Minister saying that now we have another big money man globalist George
[27:42.520 --> 27:47.040]  Soros saying that it is crucial that the European Union have a centralized
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.000]  authority we have told you all along this is the way this thing rolls just
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.760]  like we're going to see with the transatlantic and trans Pacific
[27:53.760 --> 27:57.920]  partnership they will create free trade zones then they will move to a greater
[27:57.920 --> 28:02.060]  economic union then they will have an economic crisis because of the
[28:02.060 --> 28:07.280]  socialism and the welfare state policies that they've created and debt the
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.280]  people to where they cannot pay for it anymore then they're going to say well
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.160]  we the bankers now have to take control over you irresponsible people that's
[28:15.160 --> 28:19.880]  precisely how this is all working out and we can see this plan falling into
[28:19.880 --> 28:23.360]  place as we've been telling you for a very long time here at Info Wars another
[28:23.360 --> 28:28.400]  article up on Info Wars.com TPP leaks show us that the US stands firm that
[28:28.400 --> 28:33.800]  companies should be free to abuse patents and copyrights this is from tech
[28:33.800 --> 28:37.000]  dirt and they point out that earlier reports have suggested that everyone
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.720]  was just weeks away from finishing the TPP and the TTIP many had said that the
[28:43.720 --> 28:47.200]  only thing holding back a final agreement was fast-tracked authority from
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.120]  the US now that's been put through and I noticed when they were putting that
[28:50.120 --> 28:54.560]  through they have a lot of different conditions on it in terms of it cannot
[28:54.560 --> 28:57.680]  be stopped it doesn't need a recommendation out of committee it
[28:57.680 --> 29:00.520]  doesn't need a recommendation from the leader if it doesn't go to the House
[29:00.520 --> 29:04.680]  floor within a short period of time it will automatically go to the House floor
[29:04.680 --> 29:10.960]  to the Senate floor at that point there will be no more debate than 20 hours the
[29:10.960 --> 29:14.600]  Senate cannot filibuster it but one of the interesting things and of course no
[29:14.600 --> 29:18.720]  amendments of course no amendments one of the things that was interesting was
[29:18.720 --> 29:23.080]  that they were saying that this agreement had to be that this was
[29:23.080 --> 29:26.960]  something that had to be negotiated after the the TPA and of course they've
[29:26.960 --> 29:30.240]  been working on this thing for years although how are they going to work
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.040]  this out well they're just kind of delaying it but the latest proposals
[29:34.040 --> 29:40.800]  show that they want to have a system that is anti-competitive abusive they
[29:40.800 --> 29:44.240]  say because when the Australians said we're going to take away patents that
[29:44.240 --> 29:48.160]  are that can be characterized that way they said no we're not they oppose it in
[29:48.160 --> 29:53.200]  the U.S. they will be right back the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:53.200 --> 29:56.800]  GCN radio network
[29:58.480 --> 30:04.480]  Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards wants all those bogus videos released at
[30:04.480 --> 30:09.560]  once spoken like someone who really wants to know how much dirt they have on
[30:09.560 --> 30:14.200]  her so she can get her story straight the Center for Medical Progress has
[30:14.200 --> 30:18.600]  hours more footage in the can and is deliberately drip feeding it to the
[30:18.600 --> 30:23.600]  public to keep the issue of organ harvesting from aborted fetuses in the
[30:23.600 --> 30:29.360]  headlines and Planned Parenthood hates it Richards took to Twitter yesterday to
[30:29.360 --> 30:34.880]  complain about the method saying leaking one at a time is playing politics of
[30:34.880 --> 30:40.360]  course this method is being used to maximize impact as it rightfully should
[30:40.360 --> 30:44.600]  releasing them all at once would amount to a little more than outrage of the day
[30:44.600 --> 30:49.520]  status and then it'll be quickly swept under the rug not this time Planned
[30:49.520 --> 30:55.560]  Parenthood follow this story and the slow torturous release of the upcoming
[30:55.560 --> 31:01.760]  videos at info wars.com Alex Jones here with a very important news alert for
[31:01.760 --> 31:05.560]  info wars listeners we've confirmed through our major suppliers attempting
[31:05.560 --> 31:10.520]  to resupply survival shield x2 deep earth crystals that elite corporations are
[31:10.520 --> 31:15.280]  buying up the supplies all over the world so prices are going up and it's very
[31:15.280 --> 31:19.840]  hard to secure it we have been able to secure a limited supply of the pure
[31:19.840 --> 31:24.080]  deep earth crystals and have now been able to produce more survival shield
[31:24.080 --> 31:28.360]  nascent iodine x2 this is the good halogen this is the opposite of the

[33:06.680 --> 33:12.640]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the
[33:12.640 --> 33:20.960]  GCN radio network on yesterday's syndicated radio TV transmission I
[33:20.960 --> 33:25.680]  broke down a detailed report on when I dubbed operation chaos how all over the
[33:25.680 --> 33:30.800]  western world the elites are encouraging illegal populations to flood in with
[33:30.800 --> 33:34.800]  the promise of free welfare free health care have your babies for free
[33:34.800 --> 33:38.960]  everything else we talked about cities in california like huntington park that
[33:38.960 --> 33:43.560]  is appointing the key commissions illegal aliens to run major city
[33:43.560 --> 33:46.960]  departments who don't even have the credentials on top of the fact that
[33:46.960 --> 33:50.960]  they're breaking the law this is sedition this is treason by the ultra
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.680]  elite with the outnumbering giant third world populations and if you look at
[33:56.680 --> 34:01.480]  the parallels with Rome Caesar's Roman emperors later towards the decline would
[34:01.480 --> 34:06.760]  actually bring in mercenary armies and mercenary worker groups to displace and
[34:06.760 --> 34:12.160]  control politically Romans that ended up bringing down Rome and now in Italy in
[34:12.160 --> 34:16.760]  France in the UK in Greece especially we showed you the New York Times article
[34:16.760 --> 34:21.720]  yesterday it is a full scale again what was the term that was used full scale
[34:21.720 --> 34:25.160]  disaster of the New York Times said while they promote the policies of all
[34:25.160 --> 34:29.320]  this free welfare that helps cause this and not deporting the lion's share of
[34:29.320 --> 34:34.400]  these people the world is collapsing this is only going to get worse but the
[34:34.400 --> 34:37.920]  globalists will always offer their solution giving them more taxes more
[34:37.920 --> 34:42.800]  power more police state control which they then don't even use to secure the
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.920]  borders the wealth and the sovereignty we need the West to stay incredibly
[34:46.920 --> 34:51.600]  wealthy powerful innovative and then transfer technology to the third world
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.440]  and build tourist destinations and economic development zone destinations
[34:56.440 --> 35:01.440]  inside third world nations to build them up now that's the public promotion for
[35:01.440 --> 35:06.800]  60 years of globalism they said that and it made sense but they haven't
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.000]  delivered instead it's about keeping them poor it's about exploiting them it's
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.120]  about deindustrializing them it's about sewing destabilization this has all
[35:15.120 --> 35:18.440]  been declassified that's why they fund ISIS to run around the whole Middle
[35:18.440 --> 35:25.120]  East and now if Syria dares fight back against ISIS that's being immigrated in
[35:25.120 --> 35:29.680]  by the globalist they're going to bomb them starting next week war has been
[35:29.680 --> 35:34.640]  declared against Syria unofficially that just shows you the order out of chaos
[35:34.640 --> 35:40.840]  mentality but Rob do was able to get footage and so was I of just hordes of
[35:40.840 --> 35:43.920]  illegals just sitting around doing nothing collecting their welfare checks
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.480]  checks all over Rome I was able to get a demonstration basically against the
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.240]  open borders and other issues and what's happening economically on tape as well
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.160]  so we're going to roll some of that footage here in a moment and I'm going
[35:57.160 --> 36:02.400]  to be basically narrating over it but I know you as a listener and a viewer
[36:02.400 --> 36:05.800]  already understand these basics we've got to get the word out to other people
[36:05.800 --> 36:09.880]  but this isn't about being nice to the third world that we're doing this this
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.920]  is being done to economically drive down wages this is being done to make us
[36:13.920 --> 36:17.960]  poor all of us so we can be more politically managed this is the
[36:17.960 --> 36:22.200]  admitted plan and it's a revolution where you get the book thrown at you if
[36:22.200 --> 36:25.640]  you're a Hispanic American a black American a white American an unhyphenated
[36:25.640 --> 36:30.640]  American you're an American you get screwed over you're known as a chump but
[36:30.640 --> 36:34.880]  the illegals are above the law and can now be on the city council just be
[36:34.880 --> 36:40.480]  appointed it's wrong it's discriminatory and no one else puts up with this
[36:40.480 --> 36:48.160]  basically our political immune system has been removed America and the West has
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.120]  its shields completely down and are being subdivided are having any original
[36:53.120 --> 36:58.280]  cultures erased and destroyed so this whole plastic artificial matrix like
[36:58.280 --> 37:03.760]  system of control can be overlaid over it and that's really the story here they
[37:03.760 --> 37:06.960]  say Rome is collapsing economically and falling apart and rotting outside the
[37:06.960 --> 37:10.720]  tourist areas we've been out there and seen it for ourselves it's not just Rome
[37:10.720 --> 37:15.640]  is collapsing it's all of America it's all of Europe it's all of the West
[37:15.640 --> 37:20.480]  because we've been sold out by political interests that want us poor that want us
[37:20.480 --> 37:23.960]  dumb because they have diplomatic immunity they have governmental and
[37:23.960 --> 37:27.800]  corporate reservations that are above the law and exempt from everything they're
[37:27.800 --> 37:32.120]  doing they're safe and as long as the elites don't have to abide by the same
[37:32.120 --> 37:37.400]  laws don't have to pay the same taxes don't have to drink the same water we're
[37:37.400 --> 37:40.760]  screwed I mean it's in the news for a decade that the Chinese elite the
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.560]  German elite the British elite the US elite the Japanese elite don't take
[37:44.560 --> 37:50.280]  vaccines or they get special secret lots that are quote safe and clean they
[37:50.280 --> 37:56.280]  don't drink fluoride water they don't eat GMO they have the secret gardens all
[37:56.280 --> 37:59.880]  over the world it's even come out mainstream news where where where they
[37:59.880 --> 38:05.040]  are producing for the Chinese elite and others clean food the New World Order is
[38:05.040 --> 38:09.600]  like a hundred Manhattan projects using our money our ingenuity compartmentalized
[38:09.600 --> 38:16.800]  to set up a whole new world for the establishment an Elysium for the demigods
[38:16.800 --> 38:22.160]  that they want to become and then we get nothing only by admitting what's going
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.200]  on outside of the controlled matrix like media only by getting outside the
[38:26.200 --> 38:33.600]  bread and circuses of the modern circus maximuses and the modern coliseums only
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.520]  by getting outside of that will we regain our humanity and the mystery and
[38:38.520 --> 38:42.200]  the majesty that is the universe all around us that's how we transcend these
[38:42.200 --> 38:45.400]  people is realizing there's a whole world of mystery and a universe of mystery
[38:45.400 --> 38:49.480]  around us but the globalists are no mystery I mean I talk about Manhattan
[38:49.480 --> 38:52.480]  projects hundred plus thousand people involved for four or five years kept its
[38:52.480 --> 38:57.120]  secret no problem so they wanted to admit the a bomb production out in New
[38:57.120 --> 39:01.840]  Mexico and other areas I've known since I got on air 20 years ago I was told by
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.960]  high-level pro-lifers and others and saw documents and lawsuits that were going
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.800]  on how they were vivisecting and keeping babies alive and selling their parts
[39:09.800 --> 39:13.520]  and and now it's in the news people say I so what kill babies well you know what
[39:13.520 --> 39:18.000]  so what kill you you know what so what harvest you you know I go ahead and kill
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.160]  veterans who hadn't killed old people they'll kill you too you dumb punks you
[39:22.160 --> 39:25.280]  don't have any empathy and you don't demand standards you don't stand up for
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.080]  other people get screwed over you're gonna get screwed over everything the
[39:29.080 --> 39:33.520]  new order does is pure death and it's not gonna help the poor people fleeing
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.360]  collapsing Middle East and fleeing collapsing Africa and everywhere else
[39:37.360 --> 39:41.160]  you got to fix the new world order that's screwing these countries over you
[39:41.160 --> 39:45.880]  got to stop globalism that's meant to create a cascade of global crises that
[39:45.880 --> 39:51.800]  bring in total world domination a world cashless society a total control grid
[39:51.800 --> 39:56.240]  I'm gonna throw it back to David Knight the Info Wars crew doing a fabulous
[39:56.240 --> 40:01.120]  job in Austin Texas today we're going out to talk about the Vatican to research
[40:01.120 --> 40:04.800]  sites around Rome and the Vatican and bringing a lot of key info because the
[40:04.800 --> 40:08.520]  globalists are making their move Obama calling for world government the Pope
[40:08.520 --> 40:11.280]  calling for world government carbon taxes they've gone from this doesn't
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.840]  exist to the a merger point where they decloak to fire we've always said for
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.600]  over a decade and all the experts have agreed that when they started mitten all
[40:20.600 --> 40:23.920]  this stuff out in the open while they denied it behind the scenes we're in
[40:23.920 --> 40:28.160]  deep trouble but it's an opportunity because finally folks we can say see we
[40:28.160 --> 40:31.600]  told you we wrote books we made films exactly as we said now happening here's
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.240]  the documents don't live in denial we can do something we can say no we can
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.920]  withdraw our consent we can vote with our dollars it's an epic time to be alive
[40:40.920 --> 40:45.240]  and in my gut I knew the traveling to Europe to investigate this for myself as
[40:45.240 --> 40:50.680]  key been here a long time ago but hadn't been to this area a long time other than
[40:50.680 --> 40:55.320]  the UK we're here now and I'm gonna be traveling more few times a year at least
[40:55.320 --> 41:00.680]  to Asia and to Africa and to Latin America so we can firsthand really get
[41:00.680 --> 41:04.480]  down in the weeds and break down exactly what's happening so I'm about to go out
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.760]  it's in the morning here I'm about to go out and we're just gonna shoot tons of
[41:08.760 --> 41:12.120]  footage interview people see what we see we've already run a demonstration we've
[41:12.120 --> 41:15.960]  already run into just all sorts of stuff and this is what it's all about true
[41:15.960 --> 41:20.560]  journalism where we wear the truth on our sleeve our bias to be honorable we
[41:20.560 --> 41:24.240]  were open about it where we don't follow talking points we follow history our
[41:24.240 --> 41:28.720]  hearts and the good conscience that the good Lord gave us Alex Jones signing off
[41:28.720 --> 41:36.280]  for info wars dot com from Rome Italy again that's Alex Jones reporting on the
[41:36.280 --> 41:40.640]  globalist takeover in Europe and as we mentioned in the last segment a story up
[41:40.640 --> 41:45.720]  on info wars dot com euro group bankers call for quote economic government
[41:45.720 --> 41:50.360]  unquote more taxes levied on citizen proposal floated despite long-standing
[41:50.360 --> 41:56.480]  taboo against EU wide taxation so they came in and said it's just going to be a
[41:56.480 --> 42:00.520]  trading zone it's gonna free a free trade zone the European Union it was
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.800]  going to lift everybody's economies up because they were going to remove the
[42:03.800 --> 42:07.600]  trade sanctions let people move freely back and forth between the borders
[42:07.600 --> 42:13.320]  within Europe and now what we see happening is we see a massive immigration
[42:13.320 --> 42:18.720]  from other areas outside of Europe we now see that they've taken the socialist
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.920]  welfare states the bankers have encouraged said you are now so far in
[42:22.920 --> 42:26.560]  debt to us that we're going to have to take over take your assets sees your
[42:26.560 --> 42:30.640]  assets as they're doing in Greece and sees your sovereignty that's precisely
[42:30.640 --> 42:33.720]  what they're doing I'm going to go back and cover some more economic news
[42:33.720 --> 42:38.160]  because the other aspect of this of course is the Trans Pacific partnership
[42:38.160 --> 42:42.240]  and I didn't have time to get into that article before we went to break before I
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.960]  do just want to let you know that we still have free shipping this week
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.160]  everything at info wars life comm is available with free shipping we have
[42:49.160 --> 42:56.280]  survival shield x2 that's our nascent iodine x2 has over 400 reviews on info
[42:56.280 --> 43:00.440]  wars life comm over 99% of the respondents would recommend it to a
[43:00.440 --> 43:04.640]  friend or family member let me read you one of those responses right now this
[43:04.640 --> 43:12.080]  is from gex 611 Toronto Canada he says I love this product Alex Jones knows
[43:12.080 --> 43:15.600]  what he's doing I'm glad he's helping many people this is the right way to do
[43:15.600 --> 43:20.120]  so give them something that works fast it's easy to use priced fairly and the
[43:20.120 --> 43:24.080]  results will show for itself it's a win-win for us all exactly that's why
[43:24.080 --> 43:26.920]  we do this that's why we support our operation this way we have to support it
[43:26.920 --> 43:30.920]  somehow we could do it with donations we could get government grants
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.520]  presumably I guess from MSNBC I don't think the government would give us any
[43:35.520 --> 43:39.320]  money but we appreciate your support that's one of the reasons we have done
[43:39.320 --> 43:42.760]  it this way we want to help people to do something about their health because if
[43:42.760 --> 43:47.760]  you don't have your health you can't fight the fight for liberty for individual
[43:47.760 --> 43:52.280]  liberty so we offer these products and we appreciate those people who support us
[43:52.280 --> 43:55.920]  that's why we've extended this for another week and we also have just
[43:55.920 --> 44:02.280]  briefly a flash sale on Occupower this is a 24-hour sale you can get 30% off of

[44:13.240 --> 44:16.880]  order to keep that happening and so we support that with this nutritional
[44:16.880 --> 44:21.040]  natural nutritional ingredients that you'll find in Occupower things that
[44:21.040 --> 44:26.400]  are targeted towards that again 30% off Occupower for the next 24 hours everything
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.280]  free shipping just through the end of this week now as we're reporting just
[44:31.280 --> 44:37.120]  before we went to the break there's another leak of some information from
[44:37.120 --> 44:43.200]  the secretive TPP and TTIP the transatlantic trans-specific partnership
[44:43.200 --> 44:46.960]  agreement so we're not allowed to see they're being created by the corporate
[44:46.960 --> 44:52.400]  lobbyists and we can't see those although we have had Senator Sessions and a
[44:52.400 --> 44:55.880]  few others go to look at it Senator Sessions says this is something we
[44:55.880 --> 45:00.160]  should all be very concerned about because it is not free trade this is
[45:00.160 --> 45:04.320]  about creating a global governance committee that we have no say so as to
[45:04.320 --> 45:07.360]  who goes there just as we don't have any say so about what goes into these
[45:07.360 --> 45:14.320]  treaties and the treaty itself once it's passed by the Congress without
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.680]  amendment once that is passed then it will be infinitely amendable by this
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.640]  transnational governance this committee that will be set up how does that work
[45:25.640 --> 45:29.880]  well it's going to be a living document just as the liberals like to pretend the
[45:29.880 --> 45:34.680]  Constitution is a liberal dot a living document that's the way they get it to
[45:34.680 --> 45:39.520]  be a liberal document by saying it is living these are the folks at KEI they've
[45:39.520 --> 45:43.600]  started releasing a leaked copy of the intellectual property chapter this is
[45:43.600 --> 45:47.880]  one of the key things that lets us know that this is besides the international
[45:47.880 --> 45:53.520]  governance besides the elevation of corporations to the level of governments
[45:53.520 --> 45:56.640]  with this arbitration process that people have talked about state investor
[45:56.640 --> 46:01.240]  arbitration court besides all of those clues we know that this is not about
[46:01.240 --> 46:05.640]  free trade because of things like the intellectual property chapter as it
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.640]  stood on May 11th and that was the latest draft prior to the meeting that
[46:09.640 --> 46:14.320]  they had last week they say in countless ways the Obama administration has sought
[46:14.320 --> 46:20.280]  to expand and extend drug monopolies in order to raise prices the astonishing
[46:20.280 --> 46:24.280]  collection of proposals pandering the big drug companies make more difficult
[46:24.280 --> 46:28.480]  the task of ensuring access to drugs for the treatment of cancer and other
[46:28.480 --> 46:32.760]  diseases and conditions they say there is widely reported dispute over the
[46:32.760 --> 46:38.120]  number of years of protection for biologic drug test data but they say
[46:38.120 --> 46:41.200]  this agreement when they're summarizing what's in there they say this
[46:41.200 --> 46:45.440]  focuses more on intellectual property rights for drug companies and a death
[46:45.440 --> 46:53.120]  inducing spiral of higher prices and barriers to access so one of the
[46:53.120 --> 46:57.680]  countries involved Australia put out a proposal they said well countries should
[46:57.680 --> 47:04.200]  be able to cancel revoke or nullify a patent if quote the patent is used in a
[47:04.200 --> 47:09.360]  manner determined to be anti competitive or abusive by a judicial or
[47:09.360 --> 47:12.760]  administrative proceeding well that sounds reasonable doesn't it if somebody
[47:12.760 --> 47:18.360]  is using their patent in an anti competitive or abusive way and they've
[47:18.360 --> 47:23.080]  extended it for an extremely long time then we ought to be able to take that
[47:23.080 --> 47:29.800]  patent away but the US opposes that as well as Japan somebody should tell the
[47:29.800 --> 47:35.520]  Aussies that that's the whole point of the secret trade agreement is to extend
[47:35.520 --> 47:40.360]  monopoly control for these people who are writing the agreement in secret it's
[47:40.360 --> 47:44.520]  not about free trade folks we can have this agreement this argument between
[47:44.520 --> 47:49.720]  free trade and jobs and so forth we can have that argument but that's not what
[47:49.720 --> 47:54.320]  this is about this goes far beyond that it's about global governance we've seen
[47:54.320 --> 47:58.240]  the Trilateral Commission even set up to talk about how there would be three
[47:58.240 --> 48:02.760]  different blocks and then we would combine those three blocks together into
[48:02.760 --> 48:08.480]  a global governance those three blocks are surprisingly North America Europe
[48:08.480 --> 48:13.040]  and Asia how are these treaties operating well that's precisely what
[48:13.040 --> 48:15.640]  they're creating let's look at the way this is working out we've talked a lot
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.680]  about Greece we've talked some about Venezuela now we see not only has
[48:19.680 --> 48:25.240]  Venezuela given and a 700% return on investment to the bankers they bragged
[48:25.240 --> 48:29.200]  about that we've talked about that many times how they would get a 700% return
[48:29.200 --> 48:32.920]  on investment according to Bloomberg it was a great investment to invest with
[48:32.920 --> 48:37.200]  the socialists like Hugo Chavez and Venezuela because they knew that they
[48:37.200 --> 48:41.560]  needed to pay the bankers first it took priority even over their own people
[48:41.560 --> 48:47.080]  getting food water and medicine now we see Venezuela's inflation is going to
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.880]  800% so see how that works first you create a welfare state and you go into
[48:51.880 --> 48:56.040]  debt to the bankers you pay them first they make a 700% return on investment
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.760]  the people are starving can't get food and water can't get medicine and then
[48:59.760 --> 49:06.240]  your currency goes into hyperinflation as a pattern for enslavement and that's
[49:06.240 --> 49:09.840]  precisely what they are trying to feed the people in Europe right now when they
[49:09.840 --> 49:13.560]  say that they need to have economic governance they need to surrender
[49:13.560 --> 49:18.720]  sovereignty to the center and we see Alan Greenspan, George Soros, PIMCO all
[49:18.720 --> 49:22.680]  saying yes the only way this is going to work is for people to surrender their
[49:22.680 --> 49:27.760]  sovereignty so now we see the latest indication that things are that
[49:27.760 --> 49:34.480]  socialism doesn't work Venezuela's inflation goes to 800% now there was
[49:34.480 --> 49:39.280]  an interesting article that we had I think it was info wars.com had this but
[49:39.280 --> 49:42.760]  it's originally from the Mises Institute and they were talking about
[49:42.760 --> 49:47.480]  Greece's reliance on public funds being the central problem as we've said many
[49:47.480 --> 49:51.760]  times it's not that the Greek people are not working hard when you look at it
[49:51.760 --> 49:57.440]  they put in an average annual work hours by country when that's sorted we see
[49:57.440 --> 50:01.600]  that Greece is second only to Mexico in terms of the average number of hours
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.760]  work so they're very hard working they put in more hours on average than people
[50:05.760 --> 50:09.520]  in the United States do but the problem comes when you flip it to the next graph
[50:09.520 --> 50:15.440]  and you see the percentage population reliant on public funding a measure of
[50:15.440 --> 50:22.160]  socialism we see that the US is around 40% just over 40% of the population
[50:22.160 --> 50:26.480]  reliant on public funding and of course that doesn't include the people who work
[50:26.480 --> 50:29.640]  for the government unfortunately so that would put us much much higher but
[50:29.640 --> 50:36.520]  just on this yardstick alone we see that Greece is up to over 60% that right
[50:36.520 --> 50:40.640]  there is what happens eventually you run out of other people's money as Margaret
[50:40.640 --> 50:44.920]  Thatcher said and eventually they run you out of your home they seize the
[50:44.920 --> 50:49.320]  hard assets in your country as they're doing in Greece and then they dictate to
[50:49.320 --> 50:54.000]  you what your laws will be stay with us we'll be right back
[50:58.160 --> 51:02.400]  so I say to market lunch look you know I keep hearing from the government that
[51:02.400 --> 51:06.840]  you know they're worried someday ISIS may get here and I go Doug of Garland
[51:06.840 --> 51:11.960]  Texas Mohammed cartoon shooting ISIS is already here I'm not waiting for these

[54:09.880 --> 54:17.200]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday August 6th 2015 we have an
[54:17.200 --> 54:21.280]  article up on info wars dot com video Berkeley students saying that the
[54:21.280 --> 54:26.320]  Chattanooga attack on soldiers was quote-unquote legitimate they also saying
[54:26.320 --> 54:30.800]  that calling the shooter a Muslim is also racist well he actually called
[54:30.800 --> 54:36.160]  himself a Muslim he made it very clear that he was a jihadist and that he was
[54:36.160 --> 54:41.240]  deliberately targeting the military but of course I thought it was only the
[54:41.240 --> 54:45.920]  right-wingers who were supposedly hated the military the Tea Party guys and
[54:45.920 --> 54:51.480]  that sort of thing but we see that these people want to put this into a racist
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.440]  context that's the insanity that we see coming into this country where
[54:56.440 --> 55:01.640]  everything is put into a racist context just as we saw the video that Mark
[55:01.640 --> 55:04.880]  Dice had where he was asking people about the Bill of Rights he talked to a
[55:04.880 --> 55:08.440]  black man and he goes well I think it's like you know I think it's kind of
[55:08.440 --> 55:11.400]  racist the Bill of Rights so yeah if Hillary wants to get rid of it I'm I'm
[55:11.400 --> 55:14.360]  sure it's because it's racist and he goes well what percentage will be racist
[55:14.360 --> 55:19.760]  well I don't know maybe about 30% 30% racist so we ought to get rid of it so
[55:19.760 --> 55:25.400]  he doesn't realize is that it protects his rights as an individual and if we
[55:25.400 --> 55:29.480]  stop seeing ourselves as individuals and start seeing ourselves solely as
[55:29.480 --> 55:35.560]  members of groups then we are ripe to be manipulated for a civil war for a race
[55:35.560 --> 55:39.840]  war for political purposes take a look at this other article here we've got it
[55:39.840 --> 55:44.720]  info wars.com a Twitter bot to correct people who use the term illegal
[55:44.720 --> 55:48.920]  immigrants now this is a couple of politically correct journalists with
[55:48.920 --> 55:55.160]  fusion.net a Disney ABC owned media provider they created a Twitter robot a
[55:55.160 --> 55:59.120]  Twitter bot that corrects people who use the term illegal immigrant by Twitter
[55:59.120 --> 56:02.360]  bot they mean that it is searching Twitter whenever it sees these terms
[56:02.360 --> 56:08.080]  this program will automatically send a tweet to them advising them to change
[56:08.080 --> 56:12.920]  their use of language it was called drop the I bot drop the I bot maybe they
[56:12.920 --> 56:15.400]  should just drop their bot and actually that's what Twitter did Twitter
[56:15.400 --> 56:18.520]  suspended their account but what they were doing was they would see somebody
[56:18.520 --> 56:24.280]  use the term illegal alien and they would say quote people aren't illegal try
[56:24.280 --> 56:29.080]  saying undocumented immigrant or unauthorized immigrant instead well
[56:29.080 --> 56:33.560]  actually no people are here illegally that's the whole point that's the whole
[56:33.560 --> 56:39.280]  point of the anger and the frustration that people have the fact that it's not
[56:39.280 --> 56:43.240]  they say it's dehumanizing to call somebody illegal but it's dehumanizing
[56:43.240 --> 56:47.560]  for us to lose our equal protection under the law we don't have equal
[56:47.560 --> 56:52.840]  protection of the law they want to attract out of control immigration they
[56:52.840 --> 56:56.560]  want to bring people in faster than we can absorb them socially or
[56:56.560 --> 57:03.000]  economically and they're incentivizing this and in order to do that they're
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.880]  giving illegal immigrants as well as legal immigrants benefits that we as
[57:06.880 --> 57:12.000]  citizens don't even enjoy things like in-state tuition in every state we can
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.480]  only get it in the state in which we live they get it in every state they
[57:15.480 --> 57:20.080]  have a catch-and-release program for illegal violent criminals they're given
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.520]  essentially diplomatic immunity when they commit crime so we want to see
[57:24.520 --> 57:27.400]  equal protection of the law we would like to actually see some protection from
[57:27.400 --> 57:30.640]  our government instead of the government constantly attacking us but of
[57:30.640 --> 57:35.360]  course when we do that we get hit with these politically correct robots which
[57:35.360 --> 57:39.240]  is exactly what we see there Zuckerberg is saying another social site not
[57:39.240 --> 57:45.200]  Twitter but Facebook executive says that the GOP's immigration stance will doom
[57:45.200 --> 57:51.240]  it well you know Boehner McConnell Paul Ryan Scalise the leadership they
[57:51.240 --> 57:57.040]  really don't care they really don't care whether they allow they'll use
[57:57.040 --> 58:00.680]  rhetoric to get elected that says they're going to do something about
[58:00.680 --> 58:04.680]  treating illegal and legal aliens better than they treat American citizens
[58:04.680 --> 58:10.000]  they'll say that and meanwhile they will let that happen and not do anything to
[58:10.000 --> 58:13.840]  stop it because they could care less about the GOP brand and you know what
[58:13.840 --> 58:18.520]  you should care less about the GOP brand it's just another grouping to
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.320]  control you just like getting you controlled into black versus white
[58:22.320 --> 58:27.120]  Republican versus Democrat they don't care about destroying the GOP brand and
[58:27.120 --> 58:30.720]  you shouldn't either you should care about America you should care about
[58:30.720 --> 58:34.960]  yourself and your family the heck with the GOP stay with us we're very right
[58:34.960 --> 58:38.960]  back and we're gonna talk about this debate coming up

[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.920]  Alex Jones
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.960]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show this August 6 2015 I'm David Knight your
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.360]  host joining us in the next hour will be Jim Mars and we're going to talk about
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.640]  his recent book population on population control there's many different aspects
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.520]  to population control of course and we're going to talk to him about that so
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.960]  stay with us when we get back he'll be with us in the third hour I want to
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.080]  talk about the debate that's coming up we've got the 70th anniversary of the
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.560]  bombing of Hiroshima we're gonna talk about that as well in this segment I
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.720]  want to cover some of the breaking news that's coming out of course we were
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.440]  talking in the last segment about immigration and about the political
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.000]  correctness of many people who are trying to shut down the discussion on
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.320]  immigration how the GOP although it talks about it doesn't do anything about
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.400]  it that's the key thing that is behind the rise of Donald Trump I believe the
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.680]  fact that and I hope it's true I hope he would do something about it if he were
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:30.880]  elected we've heard a lot of talk a lot of talk from the GOP in recent
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.360]  elections and they don't do anything about Obamacare they don't do anything
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.760]  about the open borders and of course I don't want to see a fence put up I want
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.640]  to see them stop attracting people they've worked very hard to draw people
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.880]  into this country by incentivizing immigration and by using it to lower
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.480]  their wage costs many corporations have done this so we need to stop that on the
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.520]  basis of the corporations and we need to stop the government from doing it but
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:01.040]  they're not here's an article Obama is providing extra million one million
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.200]  alien work permits annually they say the Obama administration has issued more
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:12.120]  than 7.4 million work permits to foreign nationals from 2009 to 2014 beyond
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.280]  the approximately 1 million lawful permanent residents and 700,000 foreign
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.560]  guest workers admitted to the US each year they say the Obama administration
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.560]  has been approving work authorizations for immigrants beyond admission limits
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.600]  and for some categories of immigrants that Congress never intended to work in
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:34.600]  the United States so that's why they have a special visa program to bring in
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:38.280]  people that they cannot get there was it was sold as something that they would
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.040]  use to bring in scientists or engineers who are experts in their field that they
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.160]  could not find in America that particular visa program however has been
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.000]  used by Disney even by Donald Trump's organization Donald Trump's brought in
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.800]  1100 people on that visa program we've seen in Disney that they brought in
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.800]  massive numbers of people from India and in both of these cases they weren't
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.840]  technical people both in Trump's case as well as Disney's case they were not
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:09.840]  technical non-replaceable people these were service businesses in the case of
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.680]  Disney they brought in these Indian immigrants told the American workers to
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.200]  train their replacements and they did it all under a program that was
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:24.040]  supposedly for people that we could not find here in America so they just want
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:29.080]  cheaper labor folks and of course the government has a different agenda the
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.360]  government has an operation chaos agenda as Alex was pointing out it's not
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.880]  just in America but it's also in Europe we have a home secretary who said this
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:45.680]  is unsustainable and her approach was to guess what stop attracting people by
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.200]  lowering the subsidies that they were giving immigrants into Great Britain
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.080]  that's how you stop it you start to roll back the welfare state that we can't
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.200]  even afford for our own citizens let alone for anyone who wants to come into
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.120]  this country with or without our permission and make themselves a
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.200]  dependent it has to stop we can't afford it we can't do it it's kind of like the
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:12.160]  situation when you're on an airplane and the masks were to descend the first
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.000]  thing you're told is to put it on yourself before you try to put it on your
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  children because if you pass out nobody's going to help them so you have to
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.480]  take care of the core first before you can help the people surrounding you and
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.960]  there's a limit to the number of people of course that we can bring in this
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:34.600]  report to should also concern you because we also have this week the black hat
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.440]  conference in Vegas and the DEF CON conference here's a little $32 device
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:43.720]  that will allow anybody to duplicate what's on your wireless key fob to steal
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:49.400]  your car or to get into your garage very simple way to do it it is so easy as we
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.440]  become more and more reliant on these high-tech gadgets we become more and
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.640]  more vulnerable to bad actors as well as to our government stay with us we're
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.640]  going to talk about the debate what are your kids eating for lunch well if
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.160]  they're eating the Michelle Obama backed federal lunch program they're
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.840]  chowing down on carcinogenic processed meat the result in higher rates of
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.960]  cancer that's according to clinician Daniel Jarvis who says despite being
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.600]  labeled nutritious the government is buying food in bulk from large
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.800]  corporations who are pushing nuggets corn dogs and pepperoni pizzas these
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.920]  corporations are profiteering by hundreds of millions of dollars while
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:30.480]  stuffing lunches junk food you've seen the photos for well over a year
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.800]  American school kids have been tweeting out images of bug-infested moldy food

[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.840]  small portions no doubt those canned servings are the result of trying to
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.640]  keep sodium in the preservative laden junk food at federally regulated levels

[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:20.120]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host on this
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:27.080]  Thursday August 6 2015 tonight is the first of the real debates Donald Trump
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:32.000]  will be there and it'll be limited to 10 there'll be a junior varsity debate
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.560]  earlier in the day for the people who are pulling really really low people like
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:42.440]  Rick Perry Rick Santorum Lindsey Graham Carly Fiorina and somebody that I don't
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.880]  even remember their name so low so they're gonna have that at earlier in
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.600]  the afternoon and then of course the debate with 10 candidates is not really
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.800]  clear how much time any of these people are going to have or if there'll be of
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.120]  anything of any substance but everybody has hopes that there will be because they
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:05.720]  believe that Donald Trump is not going to follow the staid formula that we saw
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:11.440]  on the debate on Monday night before we get to that and we'll talk about that I
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.120]  want to talk about the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima from a
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.200]  different perspective not from a military perspective not even whether it
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.600]  was the right thing to do but I want to put you on the ground level there was a
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.040]  story from the Washington Post so we're gonna talk about that we're also going to
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:31.520]  talk about some revelations about the Planned Parenthood scandal we now see
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.960]  some of the places where these baby parts are being used something you need
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.240]  to think about with that as well before we do I just want to let you know that
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:47.600]  we have a we have free shipping at the Info Wars Life Store we have extended
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.240]  that for one more week but it is going to end the end of this week it's going to
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.360]  end tomorrow we extended it once from the month of July we extended it for one
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.360]  more week because a lot of people are on vacation traveling I think a lot of
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.320]  people didn't realize we had free shipping we didn't really talk about it
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.200]  that much until just the end of the month so extended it for one more week as a
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.120]  thank you and everything that you get at info wars life calm has free shipping

[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:30.440]  here's a review from Steve from Texas he says I'm a healthy 58 year old male but
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.480]  this product has made me feel 20 years younger I have great energy my hearing
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.040]  and vision seemed better as well as my mental acuity again you can look at the

[01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:01.800]  products they're going to the election night we've got a lot of anticipation
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.160]  tonight they say however from the hill that the election model predicts that
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.240]  Democrats will win you can take this one with a grain of salt folks I've seen so
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.760]  many people jump into this and say this is over you have to support candidate so
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:19.240]  and so or we're all doomed well as I've said many times I don't think one person
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.360]  is really going to change things I'm for people who are going to open up the
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.440]  discussion I'm for people who are going to focus us on issues that we haven't
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.040]  heard talked about we're going to do it in a way that's going to engage the
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.080]  population in ways that are going to move us towards individual freedom and I
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.160]  think that Donald Trump is going to open up the discussion I think that Rand
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.240]  Paul is going to move us in ways that will impact our individual liberties
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.520]  that's my personal feel on it but of course we look at this they want to
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.400]  scare everybody into thinking that the world is over unless we get our guy in
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.760]  as president I've said many times we need to start pushing as hard on jury
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:00.800]  nullification education and getting behind things like that as we do getting
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.840]  behind a particular candidate that's where we can stop this tyranny whether
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:10.400]  it's state laws or whether it's local laws from your city council or whether
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.000]  it is the federal government trying to impose something on you if you're in a
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.880]  jury you are there to judge the law and not just the facts the judge will lie
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:24.240]  to you he will tell you otherwise but you need to understand that in most cases
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.840]  it's explicitly stated in most state constitutions the long history of trial
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:35.000]  by jury is founded on the principle that the jury is trying the law as well as
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.400]  the facts of the case that has always been the case but they will lie to you
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.440]  about it they will penalize and disbar lawyers who talk to you about it you
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.120]  need to stand up for your individual rights if we only had one person out of
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.560]  12 on every jury that's an 8% solution we would get this over with we could
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.920]  stop many laws with state nullification you can have more effect at the state
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:00.360]  level getting behind a good sheriff in your area that's very important locally
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.520]  get focused locally stop letting them redirect you to the places where you
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.680]  have the least effect at least effect where you have the least power and
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.800]  that is at the presidential race nevertheless we're all going to talk
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.480]  about it I do believe that it is good to talk about if we can have an open
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.640]  discussion on some of these issues but there are people like Moody's analytics
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:25.640]  who want to tell you that they they've already decided that the Democrat
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.000]  presidential nominee will capture 270 electoral votes they've even got it down
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.320]  270 electoral votes in 2016 according to their model well you know what garbage
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.200]  in garbage out that's what we always said in engineering about computer models
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.760]  I don't bow down before computer models it's one of the reasons why I take with
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.240]  a grain of salt so many of these pronouncements that are made about
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.040]  man-made global warming I don't believe that there's global warming going on and
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:54.840]  I certainly don't believe that the contributions of man far outweigh the
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:14:02.520]  contributions of solar activity the seasons are not created by our cars if
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:10.040]  we had just think about this if we had more of an effect on the climate then
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:15.520]  the Sun does we wouldn't have seasons anymore would we there you go okay but
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.400]  Moody's is telling us that they've worked this out they're going to do a
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.960]  prediction update each month going up till November 2016 and they say their
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.640]  most important economic variable in their model is income growth in the two
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.600]  years leading up to the election well fine so that's their handicapping in the
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.360]  horse race box news moderators are looking at ways to keep the 10 candidates
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.080]  on their toes for tonight's debate and Chris Wallace is saying I don't think
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.400]  anybody knows maybe he doesn't know what you're going to get from Donald Trump
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:45.440]  what makes it such compelling television is that sense of at the very least
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:50.880]  uncertainty and at the very most danger well it's not really danger okay it's
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:55.520]  only danger to the political elites to the political correctness I think we
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.280]  need to open up and have debates that are more like we ought to have real debates
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.600]  instead these little prepared speeches and these little time limits and I don't
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.000]  think they're going to give very much time to anybody to talk I think we
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  have real debates like they do in the House of Commons my wife and I went to
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.880]  the UK a couple of times and we would always take one day to go sit in the
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.800]  House of Commons and just watch the back and forth if you haven't seen that it's
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:26.240]  great people really get passionate about things and people having to talk
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.200]  without a teleprompter without sitting there and reading a speech that's why
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.200]  we do the news the way we do here or the nightly news we do it without a
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.000]  teleprompter we do the radio without a teleprompter as well and I think people
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.800]  want to see that in politics they really want to know what you think and they
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.720]  want to see ideas debated not positions laid out that are carefully
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:50.520]  crafted and written into a script for them by their handlers okay anybody can
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:54.920]  have a position the question is do you have principles that you believe and
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.720]  that will come out in a real debate what you truly believe and if you because
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:04.480]  you're gonna have to defend it now in other news political news we see that
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.880]  the Rand Paul Super PAC officials have been indicted on federal charges this
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:14.440]  goes back four years to the Ron Paul campaign Jesse Benton and John Tate two
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.560]  top strategist to Ron Paul to Rand Paul's father and his presidential campaign
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.480]  allegedly steered seventy three thousand dollars to an Iowa State senator to
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:29.080]  convince him to endorse Ron Paul in the lead-up to the 2012 Iowa caucuses now
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.160]  they point out that these are charges that have been around long simmering
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:37.160]  charges they say is how the it's reported in a bright bar I'm sorry CNN they
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.080]  say it's been investigated by the FAC now for four years it threatens to cast
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:46.000]  clouds over the campaign of his son on the eve of the Republican presidential
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.760]  debate you think isn't that convenient timing I mean certainly I don't excuse
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.120]  what happened they think that it was reasonable they're still fighting this I
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.440]  don't know what the justification is for but certainly this is what you see with
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.960]  elections you always see some scandal erupt the night before the election or
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.960]  you see something like this that is held for four years and then brought out the
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.000]  day of the debate there may be something of substance to it but certainly they
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.560]  have timed it to try to create a problem as they're pointing another article that
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:23.280]  came out yesterday and I think is very interesting from Washington Post talks
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.760]  about how Donald Trump talked politics with Bill Clinton weeks before
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:31.800]  launching his 2016 bid and if you look at this article you can see a picture of
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.160]  Donald Trump and his wife at the time laughing it up with Bill and Hillary
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.600]  because this was from Trump's blue period as I point out yesterday just like
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.520]  Picasso he's had a blue period and then he's had a rose period a red period if
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.280]  you go back and look at this we've had pushback from political fact and some
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:52.840]  other places that said look he's given far more money to Republicans than he
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:57.960]  has to Democrats well yeah he's given two-thirds of his money to Republicans
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.480]  and a third to Democrats if you average it all together over 26 years but if you
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:08.320]  look at the chart that was put up you will see that up until five years ago he
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:12.360]  gave more money to Democrats than he did to Republicans five years ago things
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:18.080]  changed he started donating a lot more money and doing it exclusively to
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.720]  Republicans as a lead up to this but this brings up questions as to how close
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.280]  they are this was a picture that you see here with them laughing it up that was
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.280]  in 2005 that was during his blue period they say four Trump allies and one
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:32.520]  Clinton associate familiar with the exchange said that Clinton encouraged
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.600]  Trump's efforts to play a larger role in the Republican Party and offered his
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.520]  own views of the political landscape and this was something that happened in May
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.480]  just before Donald Trump yeah there's the graph I was talking about so you can
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.680]  see in previous years it was mostly Democrat money and a lot of it went to
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.560]  the Clintons he gave them a great deal of money and then the last five years
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.640]  it's been exclusively Republican and much much heavier investment they say
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.240]  Clinton's personal office in New York confirmed the call occurred in late May
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.360]  but an aide to Clinton said that the 2016 race was never specifically discussed
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.800]  so forth and so on but people with knowledge of the call in both camps
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.920]  said that it was one of many that Clinton and Trump have had over the
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:18.040]  years whether about golf or about donations to the Clinton Foundation but
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.280]  the call in May was considered to be especially sensitive coming soon after
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.000]  Hillary had declared her own presidential run the month before and
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.520]  immediately before Donald Trump declared his. Now an article from Tyler
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.840]  Durden at Zero Hedge says there's officially no difference between Jeb
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:40.600]  and Hillary their biggest donors are the same that's true and Hillary sees Jeb
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.600]  as her biggest competition she's focused on him and not on Donald Trump
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:49.040]  interestingly enough Donald Trump has given money to both of them so what does
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:52.800]  that say about how rigged the political process is say with us when we come back
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.000]  we're gonna talk about Hiroshima what it was like on the ground I win this

[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.160]  that's coming up tonight perhaps about what I'm about to talk about which is
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:41.160]  the 70th anniversary of Hiroshima or any other topic you can call in at 800-259-9231

[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.320]  the third hour of the show we're going to be talking to Jim Mars who'll be
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.840]  joining us in studio a couple of more quick notes about tonight one of the
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:00.400]  interesting things is that and we've seen this before in the past that some
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:04.360]  GOP candidates might only be on TV for five minutes during the debate I would
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.560]  say it's going to be less than that as they're talking about in this news from
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:13.520]  CBS DC they're saying that many of the candidates will get 12 minutes to make
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:18.480]  their case some may only have five minutes of FaceTime Alan Schroeder
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.680]  debate expert journalism professor at Northeastern University said that some
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:26.840]  of the 10 candidates speaking times may be so miniscule that it will be as if
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:32.360]  they weren't there at all exactly we've seen that many times throughout this as
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:37.000]  I mentioned there's a well-timed indictment against the former Paul
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.200]  campaign that I think they held this thing for four years talking about
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:46.640]  campaign contributions to a state senator in Iowa I've seen this before but
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:51.640]  now they have made an issue of it on the day of the debate again that looks
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.640]  very political there's also a GOP neocon group that is going to be running
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:02.640]  massive adds a super PAC to attack Rand Paul over Iran the same super PAC that
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.560]  launched attacks on Rand Paul's foreign policy positions is preparing to air ads
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.840]  in Iowa and New Hampshire after Thursday's GOP debate and as they point
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.880]  out in the article while neoconservatives and GOP hawks have attacked the
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:19.080]  senator's willingness to use diplomacy Paul's opposition to the Iran deal has
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.840]  also drawn fire from his libertarian conservative base anti-war comms
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:28.840]  Justin Ramondo wrote an op-ed piece calling him a fraud a failure and a liar
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.160]  so there you go that's the way it goes we all have to have perfect candidates
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:39.640]  there isn't any perfect candidate out there if you don't want to go to war
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:44.320]  drop the bomb the neocons are going to put their super PAC on you and if you
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.160]  don't think that it's not a good deal then you're going to be attacked by many
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:54.040]  in the libertarian base so make up your own mind but I think it's interesting to
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.520]  have Paul in the debate because I think he's going to bring up things from a
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.320]  different perspective and one of the things that we need to think about when
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:05.000]  we've come so cavalier about war when we have these super PACs that are
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.880]  attacking anyone who merely looks as if they don't support every war everywhere
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:16.240]  all the time as we're seeing by both the Democrats and the Republicans so many
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.600]  people voted for Obama because they thought he was going to stop wars he
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.400]  has multiplied wars he's now involved in a war in Syria where nobody is
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.320]  questioning him in the mainstream media or the political press they're not
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:34.160]  questioning the legality of this except for one reporter from RT isn't that
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.960]  amazing a reporter from RT and I don't even know if she's an American citizen
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:44.520]  or she's here covering in America but she hammered him on the legality of it
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:50.560]  what's the basis for you becoming the air support for al-Qaeda never could get
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.360]  an answer from him there is no basis for them doing this everybody should be
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:59.880]  questioning this but no one is let's think about what happened 70 years ago
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.400]  there's a report at Washington Post what it was like to survive the atomic
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:10.480]  bombing of Hiroshima and we need to think about this in terms of weapons that
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.000]  are on their way things like directed energy weapons things like swarms of
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.920]  autonomous killer robots and drones augmented human overlords things that
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.320]  have been put in Pentagon documents so we're just released it'll be two weeks
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:34.160]  ago on Friday we talked about this on the nightly news military especially the
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:39.440]  Pentagon especially DARPA seems to have no limit to what they want to do and I
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.840]  think we go back and we look at what happened in Hiroshima it provides some
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:47.720]  insights many people have said why didn't they drop it somewhere as a show
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.680]  of force they could have dropped that in Tokyo Bay some other place instead of a
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:59.120]  population center that's a question but let's put those questions of efficacy
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.600]  aside certainly there would have been a lot of people we all understand that the
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:06.760]  world would have continued on a lot of people on both sides would have died but
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.360]  this is what it was like to be at the epicenter of this one person said my
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.400]  forehead felt hot I unconsciously touched it with my hand when I looked at the
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.440]  sky over Hiroshima I saw a tiny glittering white object about the size
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.880]  of a granite of rice tinged with yellow and red which soon grew into a
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:28.000]  monstrous fireball it was traveling in my direction I felt as though it was
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.720]  going to envelop me and when we come back I'm going to read what it was like
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:37.600]  to be enveloped by that and I want you to think about this when you watch these
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:43.880]  candidates tonight press relentlessly for more military engagements in a bigger
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.640]  defense department stay with us to be right back we're on the March the
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:56.720]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.440]  Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards wants all those bogus videos released at
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:09.320]  once spoken like someone who really wants to know how much dirt they have
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.160]  on her so she can get her story straight the Center for Medical Progress has
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:18.600]  hours more footage in the can and is deliberately drip feeding it to the
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:23.560]  public to keep the issue of organ harvesting from aborted fetuses in the
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:29.320]  headlines and Planned Parenthood hates it Richards took to Twitter yesterday to
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:34.960]  complain about the method saying leaking one at a time is playing politics of
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:40.320]  course this method is being used to maximize impact as it rightfully should
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:44.560]  releasing them all at once would amount to a little more than outrage of the day

[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:50.080]  70th anniversary of the use of the nuclear bomb against Hiroshima the first
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:55.200]  time it was used and I just want to focus without getting on the the issues as I
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:59.760]  said before of whether it could have been done a different way or the different
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.920]  alternatives I just want to focus on what it was like for the people who were
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:08.520]  there this is a story from Washington Post eye witnesses to continue with what
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:13.240]  this lady said first she saw this spot like a grain of rice coming out to
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:17.160]  envelop her she said what I felt at that moment was that Hiroshima was entirely
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:22.320]  covered with only three colors I remember red black brown but nothing else
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:26.720]  many people on the street were killed almost instantly the fingertips of those
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.840]  dead bodies caught fire and the fire gradually spread over their entire bodies
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:36.720]  from their fingers a light gray liquid dripped down their hands scorching their
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.440]  fingers I felt the city of Hiroshima had disappeared all of a sudden then I
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:45.840]  looked at myself and I found my clothes had turned into rags due to the heat I
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.000]  was probably burned at the back of my head on my back on both arms and both
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.240]  legs my skin was peeling and hanging like this there were shadowy forms of
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:00.960]  people some of whom looked like walking ghosts others moved as though in pain
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.920]  like scarecrows their arms held out from their bodies with forms and hands
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:10.720]  dangling these people puzzled me until I suddenly realized they had been burned
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:15.040]  and they were holding their arms out to prevent the painful friction of raw
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.520]  surfaces rubbing together then they talked about a 21-year-old who was
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.520]  carrying her one-year-old infant and her son in a streetcar he died she said I
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:30.640]  think fragments of glass had pierced his head his face was a mess because the
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:37.160]  blood flowing from his head but he looked at my face and smiled and his
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:45.200]  smile has been glued in my memory simply collateral damage in military terms
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:52.160]  this is what we create the military industrial complex has become the most
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.240]  profitable aspect the thing that America will be remembered for we have a
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.880]  military budget that is more than half of the entire federal budget we have a
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:07.760]  military that is larger than all the other militaries combined but we need
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.800]  more because there's never enough the military industrial complex is like a
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:19.320]  greedy billionaire like David Rockefeller who said or John John D. Rockefeller
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:24.120]  who said when asked how much is enough he said just a little bit more that's
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:28.680]  what we see and I got to say to you that tonight you're not going to see many
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.640]  people push back on this idea perhaps you'll see Rand Paul push back on it and
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.840]  he'll get hammered by a super PAC for saying that we shouldn't extend this
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:44.400]  exponentially faster he still wants to grow the military industrial complex but
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.800]  not at a fast enough rate for the rest of the people in the GOP or for the
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.200]  people in the Democrat Party for that matter you think you're gonna get peace
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.080]  by voting for Hillary Clinton are you kidding me and this is the party that
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.000]  gave us Madeleine Albright who said about Iraq when she was asked about all
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:09.360]  the children who had died just from their their their their sanctions I said
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.480]  half a million children have died is it worth it
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:16.080]  so yeah yeah let's just worth it we have our objectives they could care less
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:21.000]  about innocent life and when you look at what's going on with this let me let me
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.640]  read you one of the last quotes on this article one of the people who survived
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.080]  said I learned that nuclear weapons which gnaw the minds and bodies of human
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:36.880]  beings should never be used but we're in the process under our Democrat leader of
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:43.240]  ramping up this Cold War that had ended so now we're right at the threshold of
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:48.240]  Russia we've fomented revolutions on the border of Russia we have positioned our
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.480]  troops at Russia we have revived the Cold War for the benefit of the military
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.200]  industrial complex and people like Lindsey Graham they're still not satisfied
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.640]  they want more they want a war there they want a war in Syria they want a war
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.080]  in Iraq again they're not satisfied it's not enough killing it's not enough
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:09.760]  weapons and when you look at what the Pentagon sees as our military position
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.080]  in 30 years it is absolutely amazing to even contemplate what they're doing just
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:20.000]  looking at their battlefield scenario as I mentioned before augmented human
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.160]  overlords controlling killer robots many of them operating autonomously
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.680]  directed energy weapons things like you see in Star Wars force fields all of this
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:32.280]  sort of thing of course they think that this is all going to be happening in the
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.120]  city that's part of their scenario that we really didn't talk about but that
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:40.400]  doesn't even include the other weapons not just the nuclear weapons but the
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:46.160]  bioterror weapons the CDC and the Pentagon are bringing in and handling in a
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:51.760]  very careless and cavalier manner some of the most deadly pathogens that they
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.960]  can find calling them select agents and then using gain a function experiments
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:03.920]  to try to make them deadlier more easy to catch and creating more fatalities
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:06.960]  what's going to happen when that gets loose what's going to happen when
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.920]  artificial intelligence gets loose or the nanotechnology gets loose and yet we
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.640]  race to do even more to DARPA they can never have enough that's what you need
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:21.760]  to keep in the back of your mind as you watch this debate tonight is there ever
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:27.960]  a point at which the Republicans would say that they have spied on us controlled
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:33.440]  us and created enough killing machines that it's enough at what point do they
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.880]  have to have 90% of the armies in the world 95% 99 do they have to have
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.920]  absolute and total control over everyone perhaps that's what they're
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.600]  actually aiming for it's no longer about defense it's about mass murder it's
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.520]  about destroying the human race that's what we're racing to in this arms race
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:58.040]  let's go to your calls Sherry in Texas you said you want to talk about Donald
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:04.240]  Trump go ahead Donald Trump but also something about socialism this isn't
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:11.740]  meant to be like pro Donald although I think he's very entertaining and he's
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:16.360]  got some good points it's just sort of a non-biased look here Trump's donations
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:23.080]  and civility to Democrats he explained on a Sunday morning show this last
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:27.440]  weekend had to do with his business and he said he couldn't accomplish what he
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.400]  wanted to accomplish business-wise and this was not political this is in a
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.880]  response to a question he said yes I really did I really was pro these these
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.720]  politicians on both sides of the aisle but and it wasn't political it was
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:48.440]  without it was without any disrespect that there were donations and he said
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:53.000]  when he's president he'll be focusing on the people not his business if he can in
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:01.160]  fact shift that I don't know mindset onto the people it would be great because
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:04.760]  he said he did and said a lot of things but it was for I thought it was a good
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:08.800]  answer to the question why if you're running for as a Republican if you want
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.720]  to represent the Republican Party did you do so much sucking up to the
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:16.560]  Democrats he said this because I'm a businessman so that's that's about Donald
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.400]  I thought that was a good point yeah that's the problem I have with him is
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.960]  that he's a crony capitalist businessman he was sucking up to he was sucking up
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.760]  to these people to get special favors I mean you know we complain about people
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:34.040]  who control the political process and we say these politicians are bought off by
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.440]  the corporations and then we say well here's one of the corporations one of
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.560]  the wealthy individuals who bought off the politicians so let's put him in
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.240]  charge I mean the whole process is corruption this is the guy who went in
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.520]  to Connecticut and he was going to drive at least five other smaller
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.400]  businesses out of business doing a deal with the government so that he could put
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:59.080]  in his business I don't like that I don't like that kind of crony capitalism I
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.800]  call that bully capitalism he bullied an old lady because she didn't want to
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.080]  sell her house to him so he could put up by a they could expand his parking lot
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:11.800]  and so he went to the to the casino gaming commission and got them to
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:17.200]  condemn her property and pay her a quarter of what he was going to pay her
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.120]  that's bully capitalism I'm I don't see that as as something that excuses it I
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:26.480]  see that is even more damning as excuse what what do you think Sherry you think
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:31.200]  that's okay I know it depends if we carry over or not I'm not sure if he'd carry
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:35.080]  that that mindset over if he was dealing with the people if you why would you
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.320]  think that when he's acted as I would you think that when he's acted his entire
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.840]  life in one way that somehow when he gets sworn in or get you know just like
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:46.240]  somebody is is a criminal all their life but if you put a uniform on them they
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:50.120]  somehow become a good guy I mean you know we don't we don't take former
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:53.600]  convicts and make them cops so why would why would he all of a sudden turn
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:44:00.120]  around and and do the right thing by changing his focus if he could do that
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:05.760]  well it's a lot of wishful thinking I think Donald Trump's big contribution is
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:10.960]  to open up this stale process to discussion and if we have a discussion
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.320]  we might have something emerge on some real issues right now we're just gonna
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.800]  have a bunch of prepared speeches unless we have somebody like Donald Trump so
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:22.240]  I'm glad that he did that I'm glad that he threw some fireballs I hope he opens
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.520]  up the discussion tonight but I have big questions about what he has done with
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.120]  Hillary and and Bill and other politicians how he has bought influence
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:36.080]  and I have to ask myself is this still going to be about the Donald is he
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:40.360]  want to become president so that he can become a much much richer man you know
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.800]  we had the Clintons who are basically trailer trash and their words that's
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.080]  what they call people who are working class they call them trailer trash well
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.240]  that's the background that the Clintons came from they became multi multi
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.960]  millionaires when they became president on the other side we've got Obama who
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.480]  was a a community organizer he'd never had a job he'd never had a business but
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.000]  he became a multi multi millionaire once he became president so what does a
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.120]  billionaire become when he becomes president is he going to use that to
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.240]  make himself richer because that's what he was saying he was using his political
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:17.720]  connections for was to make himself richer that's why he spread the money
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:23.480]  around with these people the bottom line of all this here here's my thought
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:27.840]  regarding this whole thing what you're saying is that the big fear that it's
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:33.440]  going to be between Donald and Bernie Sanders and that's going to cut out
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:39.360]  that's going to cut out their golden boy Jeb Bush and it's going to cut out all
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:45.160]  the all the you know the good shepherds that want to lead the flock and it's
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:49.520]  going to cut off him out and that's why they keep trying to push Donald into
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.480]  saying that he wants to be a third party he doesn't want to be in the third
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:56.480]  party he said I'll only be a third party candidate if they do something so
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.360]  horrendous and so egregious that I'm forced to not run he says they have to
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.400]  do something really unkind to me and then I would come in as a third party
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.640]  I don't plan to let me ask you this shirt assuming right now that that your
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.280]  guy is not going to get in whoever that is what could you do locally that would
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.760]  really make a difference because you don't have a whole lot of control over
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:23.520]  who gets in as president what what is it at local level that you think you could
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:28.120]  make the biggest difference the only way I ever felt like I could ever make a
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:33.160]  difference in anything is through my writing and through my website which I
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.840]  haven't been able to pursue much this last few years because of the house I
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:42.160]  bought everything but it's calling show another show I used to call in on four
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:47.400]  years and it made me gave me a sense of like we are being heard we can speak to
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:50.420]  each other this way I don't do it through email I don't put anything in
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:54.680]  writing because that's that stuff they use against you if I put on anything
[01:46:54.680 --> 01:47:00.720]  political on my side and it wasn't just more spiritual they come pick me up for
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:05.400]  the stuff I have to say but I can say it on this show and I have said it on other
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:10.520]  shows it won't take my calls anymore and this is this is this is this is great
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.640]  for me well exercising your freedom of speech is is very important and we need
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:18.320]  to understand there are many people who want to take our freedom of speech even
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:24.600]  you know on on relatively innocuous things but you know I guess the question
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:29.480]  is you know is there any issue that you really think if you organize people on
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:34.880]  that issue other than just who to vote for do you think that you could make a
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:41.200]  difference if an issue other than something that could be controlled at a
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:46.480]  local level or is there local politicians that you get involved with or are you
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:53.600]  looking at how what's good for people and what's right for people it has
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:58.280]  nothing to do with politics but really history and all that was never my
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:03.360]  interest in school it was all English and art this is politics I really don't
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.200]  know a lot about I just know when I see something like I see something with the
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:11.720]  socialism there's there's a difference between democratic and totalitarianism
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:16.520]  and people don't understand it's all about what's being restricted you know
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:21.680]  you to restrict someone's democracy that's not democratic socialism if you
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.920]  restrict the untameled working on the economic market well I want to get to
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.880]  somebody I thank you for calling I'm gonna go on to another caller because I
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.840]  want to give other people been on hold a chance but I'll just say people who who
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:36.880]  are not interested in politics and I understand because it is hard to have it
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:40.560]  an effect on it but you know they all saying if you're not interested in
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.800]  politics that doesn't mean politics isn't interested in you they will come for
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:48.680]  you if you passively set there and ignore what's going on let's go to Matt in
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:52.200]  Oklahoma Matt you wanted to talk about Planned Parenthood
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:56.400]  hey Dave what's going on hey I'm fine what's up yeah actually I just had a
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:59.880]  couple things to say real quick I'll try to top them off here we're talking about
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.260]  Donald Trump for a moment and I just wanted to mention that he is no Ross
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:09.560]  Perot and that he is definitely the Don okay and move on to my point that I
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:14.760]  wanted to make is that CNN last night it was kind of you know I saw some people
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.480]  saying oh you're playing parenthood you know it was a hoax CNN says it was a
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.800]  hoax video and you know I wasted too much time last night addressing that and
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:30.760]  I'm not sure how you try to tell somebody hey you know CNN is just mainstream
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:34.440]  media that well you know if you caught the program a couple of days ago Doug
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:40.360]  Hagman was on and live with us and he's somebody who is a licensed private
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:45.120]  investigator in several states he's got a CEO of an organization that does that
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.840]  he pointed out that this is the way investigations are always done it's
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:53.280]  entrapment if you go somewhere and and somebody's got an unrelated business to
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.120]  some criminal activity let's say that you're looking for somebody smuggling
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.840]  bombs into the country and this guy the example he uses a pizza owner and you've
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.800]  got absolutely no reason to think this pizza owner is involved in any kind of
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:12.040]  bomb smuggling but you set up and a sting operation to encourage him to
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:15.240]  think that he's going to do bomb smuggling and then you give him all
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:18.560]  these different things and and facilitate that that's what we see the FBI
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:24.640]  doing over and over again to prove that we have a terrorist threat but if it's
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.600]  somebody that has a a business that is an arms business and there's been
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.560]  reports that they're smuggling bombs and that sort of thing then you do a sting
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:36.800]  and we see this kind of investigation that is a legitimate investigation and
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:40.880]  that was what was done with Planned Parenthood this is not a hoax video this
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:45.000]  is not editing he said in all of his investigations those are always the
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.320]  alibis that people use this is a sting and what you see there people will watch
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.480]  it they will understand that stay with us we'll be right back with more of your

[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:41.320]  Jim and Georgia Jim you want to talk about abortion thank you for calling go
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:52.480]  ahead I think I think your call is breaking it can you try one more time I
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:57.800]  think we're getting a breakup on your call we've lost Jim okay let's go to
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:01.760]  Scott and Washington Scott you want to talk about the presidential race go
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:07.400]  ahead yeah actually I wanted to talk a little bit on the left side of the dial
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.720]  and I wanted to talk about two things about Bernie Sanders and I don't think
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:20.200]  which has come out the first thing and I verified this apparently he had a or
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:26.000]  it still does have a chair on the committee for the a veteran affair when
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.760]  this whole scandal came out and I came across a little blurb about this but
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:38.320]  somehow he's not answered about the stuff that's been going on with the VA and I
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:43.040]  had addressed one of his which I call him the stand and meets the followers
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:48.600]  about you know what was his position or what specifically had he done to
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.840]  address any of these issues and you know they just kind of talked around
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.600]  didn't talk about you know all the legislation he did for the poor and blah
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.760]  blah blah and what other candidate has addressed that and I turned it back on
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:06.240]  him I said well I'm asking this question of him specifically since as far as I
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:12.520]  know he's the only presidential candidate that has a chair specifically
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:18.480]  just so what is he doing to address it and the other thing quickly and I haven't
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.760]  confirmed this but I came across another blurb that indicated that one of his
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:28.880]  Senate races when he was running that he received over five million dollars from
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:35.120]  one of Hillary's Hill attack now if he's still against you know money and
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:39.520]  politics and stuff like that well where does he think he gets her money if that
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:43.240]  story is true well he gets a lot of money from the Democrat National Party
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.600]  because he pretty much votes with him down the line yeah that that's a that's
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:51.720]  a great point Scott if he's on the committee for veterans affairs and you
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:54.360]  know he doesn't really have much to say about that but of course we see that
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:57.320]  with socialists don't we and isn't that what we were just talking about how in
[01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:00.280]  Greece they said no we'll give you a referendum and then they have a
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:03.440]  referendum it's like never mind that wasn't the result we wanted so we're
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.000]  gonna do what we had planned on doing anyway we see it with Hugo Chavez where
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.080]  they give all the money to the bankers and then let the people go begging for
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:16.400]  food water and medicine and now they've got 800% hyperinflation on their
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.320]  currency there so we see this over and over again that's how the socialist role
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:25.000]  there's also the hypocrisy that of Bernie Sanders calling for a $15 an hour
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.760]  minimum wage being imposed from Washington while he pays some of his
[01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:34.680]  staffers as low as $12 an hour so it's a good point as this is all just
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:38.080]  starting I'm certainly not a pretty standard supporter he comes across as
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:43.440]  very open and genuine and contrast to Hillary Clinton but we need to look at
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:47.760]  his policies not get caught up in personalities that's the key thing let's
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.440]  go to Amicus in North Carolina you said you want to talk about Trump go ahead
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:58:00.720]  I like Trump because he's not a wimp he's actually made his money from the
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:04.560]  sweat of his back and brow a few times come back from the grave financially
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:09.280]  more than a few and it doesn't come off like a wimp like the paws and the
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:14.400]  recipes established cronies who can't get nothing done well I agree he does come
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:17.760]  across as a very strong personality he does have very strong personality I have
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:21.600]  questions about whether he did make his money by the sweat of his brow or did
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.520]  he make it with crony capitalism that's why he was greasing the palms of the
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:29.800]  Clintons and the other people he's now supposedly adamantly opposes say with us

[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:19.240]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:28.040]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight we're gonna be
[02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:31.640]  joined live in studio in the next segment with Jim Mars we'll be talking
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:36.240]  about population control the many various aspects of that in this segment I
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:39.800]  want to try to take as many calls as I can we got people who've been on hold
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:43.080]  for a while let's go to Mike and Tennessee Mike you want to talk about
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:48.120]  corruption in Tennessee you said go ahead good afternoon David this is Mike
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:52.280]  and Tennessee and I've been trying to contact you for over three months I
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:57.520]  sent email after email I must be saying it's the wrong place but right now the
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:01.880]  state of Tennessee is effectively disarming the state by going after
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:06.680]  people who are either related to our friends with someone once convicted of
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:10.440]  a felon here's how the routine works if you're convicted of a felony you go
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:15.400]  visit a friend they will raid their house steal their guns put that person in
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:20.200]  jail charging in with possession of guns even though the guns be locked up in a
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.480]  safe or in another room and you don't even know they're there they're
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:28.280]  effectively disarming the state and keeping the prisons full of people who
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.520]  are otherwise going about their own business not harming anybody well we'll
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:35.800]  take a look at that that that's what we're seeing over and over again any kind
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:42.200]  of an excuse to take people's weapons to say that a veteran is using or somebody
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.400]  who's on social security that they're having their paycheck deposited
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:48.360]  automatically that's a sign of mental incompetence and we need to go ahead and
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.920]  take their guns from them and now we're seeing this
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:56.520]  at the national level the NRA and Senator Cornyn from Texas are now
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:00.600]  talking about voluntarily enacting state laws that would
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:04.600]  increase the reporting of background checks to the feds so they can then
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:07.480]  scrutinize people we'll look into that thank you so much for letting us know
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:12.440]  that Mike in Tennessee let's go to Derek in Wyoming Derek you want to talk
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.800]  about local solutions go ahead
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:21.400]  oh he dropped off okay let's go to Anthony in Florida
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.400]  hello hey how you doing you want to talk about Hiroshima the anniversary go
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:30.120]  ahead yes I have believed for a long time that just
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:34.440]  like in Germany and in Italy there were Japanese people who
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:38.200]  spoke out against the aggressive militaristic policies of the government
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:43.080]  at that particular time but they were silenced in one form or another
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:46.840]  and they were and that's and then that's and then they
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:50.200]  the support of the Japanese people basically you know
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:53.480]  you know um we would call you know take the price for
[02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:57.560]  for leading blindly to the leading to having the government
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:01.480]  lead them into war like that oh absolutely there'll always be people
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:04.360]  who see what is going on and and that's the thing that we should all be
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.600]  concerned about when we watch this debate tonight
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:10.920]  we need to recognize that it is both parties that have been cavalier
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:14.520]  about this escalation of militarized intention we have
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:18.200]  fermented revolution uh on Russia's borders we have
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.120]  and we have revived the Cold War it looks like we've got people
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.400]  not only Obama but of course the cheerleaders for the military industrial
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:29.080]  complex and the GOP are far worse they want more done
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:32.040]  they want a war with Russia they want a war with Syria they want a war with
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:34.680]  Iran they're in anybody they don't want to go to war with because
[02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:37.640]  they want to sell weapons to the military industrial complex I would
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.400]  encourage everybody to go back and we forget about all the military
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:44.600]  strategy with all the stuff and and how the war started who is
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.080]  who is on which side just look at it and imagine yourself
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.480]  at the epicenter of this nuclear bomb and say do we want to continue
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:59.000]  this crazy arms race look at the articles that we put up about the
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.520]  war scenario of 2050 what it's going to be like
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:06.520]  in 35 years and ask yourself do we want to continue down this road do we want
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:10.040]  to have leaders who are always looking from the most
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.400]  belligerent standpoint to try to get involved in a war somewhere
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.160]  let's go to Michael in New York Michael you want to talk about Donald Trump I
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:20.600]  think go ahead yes thank you David and
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:25.320]  actually the previous callers and the whole conversation ties in with my
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:29.160]  points on Trump as with any presidential candidate
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:32.840]  let's get right down to it are you going to get it will Trump
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.000]  really get us out of the united nation this is all comes down to these wars
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.480]  and the confiscation of the guns all it is is pertaining to united nation take
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:46.280]  over now I want to know if Trump and of course I left
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:49.000]  to be able to ask him directly and or any other
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.800]  presidential candidate which we know the ends will be known to that
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:55.400]  oh yeah and of course what's driving all that is the federal reserve and the
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:58.120]  bankers uh stay with us that's all time we got for calls
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:01.240]  we'll be right back with Jim bars eating for lunch well if they're eating the
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.880]  Michelle Obama backed federal lunch program
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:07.080]  they're chowing down on carcinogenic processed meat
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:10.680]  that'll result in higher rates of cancer that's according to clinician
[02:05:10.680 --> 02:05:14.920]  Daniel Jarvis who says despite being labeled nutritious the government is
[02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:19.160]  buying food in bulk from large corporations who are pushing nuggets
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:24.280]  corn dogs and pepperoni pizzas these corporations are profiteering by hundreds
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:27.240]  of millions of dollars while stuffing lunches
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:30.680]  with junk food you've seen the photos for well over a year

[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:45.160]  no doubt those canned servings are the result of trying to keep sodium
[02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:49.080]  in the preservative laden junk food at federally regulated levels

[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:09.560]  government is the problem from time to time we've been tempted to believe
[02:08:09.560 --> 02:08:13.000]  that society has become too complex to be managed by
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.920]  self-rule that government by an elite group is superior
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:22.520]  to government for by and of the people

[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:45.800]  hearing voices that incessantly worn of government is nothing more than some
[02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:50.360]  separate sinister entities that's at the root of all our problems
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:53.800]  they'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner

[02:10:54.680 --> 02:11:00.840]  stranger to the viewers here at info wars and i wanted to get him back to
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:03.880]  talk about his book population control you were here a couple of weeks ago
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:07.720]  talking to alex about population control and i wanted to focus you we were
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:12.280]  talking just before we came back the two fallacies
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:16.920]  that are underlying the global governance and population control tell us
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.160]  about those two fallacies right well at the very top of the food chain
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.240]  and i'm not talking about politicians or presidents or
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:29.480]  or even presidents vice presidents the corporations i'm talking about the
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:33.400]  people that own them control them we talked about that last time how that
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.960]  one person may only have owned 10 of a company stock but if nobody else owns
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:40.040]  more than that then they're the controlling
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:43.880]  that's right yes okay they the basic fallacy
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:48.120]  in their argument is is that and there are numerous people i could quote
[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:51.960]  who say that the underlying problem in the world today
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:56.120]  is overpopulation it's just too many people
[02:11:56.120 --> 02:12:00.280]  okay and i guess if you live in a big city you caught in a traffic jam it's
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:05.000]  easy enough to buy into that right especially here in austin
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.880]  but just try going down out 35 yeah but uh but it's the fallacy and here's why
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:17.880]  um the oklahoma chamber of commerce does study and and realize that the entire
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:22.840]  7.5 billion population of the world could live comfortably enough in the
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:28.360]  state of oklahoma now if you want to spread out come to texas
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.040]  or if you want an acre or so for every person in the world go to austria
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:36.840]  so in other words there's really not truly an overpopulation problem there is a
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:42.520]  population concentration problem because you got everybody piling these big
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.800]  metropolitan areas but they want to make that worse
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:49.400]  because they want to control it isn't necessarily that they have a problem
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:53.240]  with a number of people they're just concerned that control may get out of
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.800]  their hands exactly and you never know who's gonna
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.000]  who's gonna rise up you might have a Beethoven or you might have somebody
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.160]  else who's gonna rise up and if they're spread out you really lose control
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:06.280]  in fact you know david if you go back and look at the whole history of the
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:09.240]  western civilization you know it started at the
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.160]  fertile crescent uh there in mesopotamia where
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:16.680]  but now is the one place we can't freely travel to which is
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.120]  iraq and then it spread north into caucas and
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:24.440]  then south to uh palestine and egypt and then greece
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:29.000]  rome filled up europe went to the british isles filled them up and then moved
[02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.960]  over to the east coast of america and then during the
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:37.240]  19th century it all spread westward until you know there's no place left to go
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:42.360]  but everybody was moving westward and why well the historians make no big
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.240]  secret about it they everybody moved throughout history to try to escape
[02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:51.160]  religious and political tyranny yes and this is
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:55.400]  we're now here in the 21st century facing the same
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:58.920]  problem but we got no place to run to that's right
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:02.360]  we're gonna have stand and fight well as we've said many times uh
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:06.360]  there was that article that was written about 10 years or so ago
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:10.520]  the future doesn't need us and they were talking about how
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:13.720]  and alex has mentioned this many times were the elitists would say well do we
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:16.760]  just kill everybody or do we just make them stupid
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:19.720]  and passive right those are two alternatives and they look at all these
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:22.920]  things that this explosion of robots this explosion of artificial
[02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:26.360]  intelligence and they really believe that they don't need us as slaves because
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:29.080]  remember robot came from the what was it the check
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:33.160]  word or the slavic word for slave so it's just a slave worker
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:38.120]  they can replace us as their slave workers with a robot and then and the
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:41.080]  robots aren't going to challenge them unless they have the ai ai get out of
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:42.680]  control now they're starting to worry about that
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:46.360]  well you see what happened in mcdonald's when they started pushing for
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:50.600]  $15 an hour and in europe they started started here and
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:53.400]  will be pretty quick they're replacing them with touchstone
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:55.960]  computers oh yeah touch computer that would accelerate it
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:01.400]  hey we just get a machine to take your place you know that's the whole thing
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:04.440]  but here you know and i know alex and and i know you
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:08.440]  too i think has talked about the georgia guide stones yes okay so
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:12.840]  and a lot of people feel like that this monument in georgia pretty well reflects
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:17.480]  the goals of the new world order and the very first ammunition says
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:22.760]  maintain humanity at 500 million in perpetual balance with nature
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:26.600]  well boy that sounds great but that begs the question
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.120]  who's gotta go yeah what happens the other seven billion of us
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:34.280]  and more importantly who decides who's gonna go and who's gonna stay
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:37.960]  and as you said you've got two choices you can either kill people
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:43.640]  or you can slowly dumb them down and and and cull the fringes
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:46.760]  and this is what's happening now because in
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:51.800]  nazi germany they took the population to its logical
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:55.240]  conclusion which is we have some people we don't like so we just kill them
[02:15:55.240 --> 02:15:59.400]  population control political control always devolves into
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:02.520]  a genocidal control and to democide and that's one of the reasons why
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:07.320]  we so adamantly support the second amendment because that's our voice
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:10.200]  and all this to keep that from happening ultimately and of course you mentioned
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:13.640]  the georgia guide stones that was something that people are still saying
[02:16:13.640 --> 02:16:16.760]  well you know who put this monument to population control up
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:20.920]  anonymously here very suspicious about that a lot of people believe that it
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:24.520]  might have been ted turner because he has advocated the same types of policies
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:28.120]  and it's right there in georgia a good suspect but now
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:31.960]  they're coming out openly now we see the pope bringing in
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:36.040]  john schellenhuber who is a german scientist who has preached for population
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:39.640]  control radical reduction just like we see with the georgia guide stones
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.320]  brings him in as a vatican scientific advisor right
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:46.120]  at the same time they're pushing for global control
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:50.600]  and the pretext of climate change and talking about how they need to have
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:55.240]  a global court a planetary council writing laws and so forth and so on
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:58.280]  full out global governance and we've got the pope pushing that
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:01.480]  and ignoring all the things that the catholic church has traditionally stood
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:04.280]  for family stopping abortion although it has
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:07.720]  nothing to say about any of this stuff it's all full on
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:11.720]  global governance all the gloves are off and let's let's consider john holdren
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:16.360]  okay yeah uh so i'm very scientific guy uh in few years
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:19.960]  back along with paul erlich and his wife they published a book
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:23.720]  in the book he said well one of the things we might do is put sterile
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:27.560]  sterilization chemicals in the water supply you know and we could always have
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:31.480]  an anecdote for the people that we want to keep alive you know
[02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:34.600]  now you know that kind of thinking them and you can you can
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:38.280]  argue back and forth on that but the point here is john holdren today
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:41.880]  is obama science advisor yes science czar
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:46.200]  yes so the guy head of presidential science advisory you know is on the
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:49.640]  record is saying yeah perhaps we need to reduce the population
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:53.480]  with sterilization and just to show you that hey these people aren't kidding
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:58.280]  they want to kill you okay because let me quote prince philip
[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:03.960]  winzers okay the royal family of england he says once that uh
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:08.280]  if he is reincarnated he wants to come back as a deadly virus
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:12.200]  to help solve the population over population problem
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:15.720]  well you know he's part of the earth league and they're again that's the
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:18.680]  connection this guy uh shellen hoover is one of the people
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:21.800]  that's on the earth league that is also now intimately connected with the pope
[02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.880]  so it connects all these guys together on the same agenda the same globalist
[02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:29.160]  agenda and he calls it the earth league i was looking at it
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:32.760]  made me think about that movie as i think is based on a cartoon
[02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:35.960]  the the league of extraordinary gentlemen yeah he
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.960]  where they were actually like monsters right like jekyll and ide was one of
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:43.320]  them so it's like these guys they've got one face
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:46.920]  that they put out to the public but behind it you know they secretly
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:50.200]  want to destroy as many people as possible because that's really where
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:53.880]  population control leads when we talk about putting stuff in the water
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.480]  don't you think it ought to raise flags with people when the government starts
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:01.160]  mass medicating us in the water supply i mean doesn't that with
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.080]  even the people who think that this is somehow going to stop cavities
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.560]  okay by drinking all this stuff you got to ask them and i constantly do and i've
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:12.440]  never had one give me an answer yet i said okay you think this is effective
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:15.880]  medication what medication do you ever take
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:19.480]  where you don't control the dosage where you give the same dosage
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:24.120]  to a child as you do to an adult man or you don't even know what that
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:27.640]  dosage is because you've dumped it into the water supply somebody might get a
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:31.160]  super concentrated amount of it other people might get none of it
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:35.320]  i mean that's the insanity but we just accept that because they tell us to do
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:37.800]  that and we know that the agenda behind that
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:42.200]  is one of at the very least the the obvious agenda
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:45.800]  is getting rid of the toxic waste for the people who are doing this they just
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:48.040]  dump it in the water stay with us we'll be right back
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:52.040]  with jim marz jimmarz.com
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:04.120]  hi this is wall augustinowitz i'm the founder and ceo of id stronghold
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:06.760]  by now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.280]  electronic pickpocketing ten years ago i created a way to protect my own cards
[02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:13.160]  from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:16.760]  a national id card with a built-in radio chip called rfid
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:21.000]  i felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports
[02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:29.480]  hotel room keys and even transit passes would all soon incorporate rfid
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:32.920]  it was then i formed id stronghold to share my inventions and blocking rfid
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:36.120]  signals with the world there are a lot of misconceptions out there
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:39.480]  today about rfid i encourage everyone to get informed and get

[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:23.560]  marz and jim marz is an award-winning journalist and author
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:26.520]  after graduating from the university of north texas with a degree in journalism
[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:30.680]  marz worked for and owned several texas newspapers before becoming an
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:35.080]  independent journalist and author his website is jim marz dot com and we're
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:38.760]  talking about his new book populations there you go show it to the
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:42.360]  camera population control what's the subtitle there how corporation
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:47.000]  how corporate owners are killing us tell us how they're killing us jim
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:51.800]  talking about involuntary medication which is what happens when they put
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.160]  sodium fluoride in your water a waste product of the
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:58.360]  aluminum and nuclear industries they would have to pay a lot of money to get
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:01.160]  rid of that but then they could charge us to dump it in our drinking water
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:04.440]  well after world war two there are international conventions and they
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:09.080]  banned the dumping of sodium fluoride among many other chemicals into the
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:12.440]  water supply because they were going the ocean right and in fact everybody
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:15.640]  so now they can't dump it somewhere so they put in our water supply and we
[02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:20.680]  drink it how brilliant is that yeah and they say yeah but it lowers it reduces
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:23.640]  cavities yes but according to studies i've read
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:28.840]  only for children mostly boys between the age of six and 12
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:31.880]  and certainly like if it's effective as a medication
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:35.640]  let people have the informed consent yeah to decide that they want to do that
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.240]  exactly and then take it as a medicine instead of trying to mass
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:42.440]  medicate the public through the water supply where nobody can control the
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:45.480]  dosage doesn't that concern you that they're giving you something that many
[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:49.080]  people think is toxic and you have absolutely no control over the dosage
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:52.120]  that ought to concern you look at this particular article jim
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:55.880]  monsanto sued over pcb contamination of spokane river
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:00.120]  in washington state they say that they of course pcb's were banned
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:04.280]  back in 1979 they say in spite of this monsanto
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:08.120]  knew they were toxic they could not be contained they would escape into the
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:10.680]  environment but despite knowing all the risk imposed
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:13.800]  monsanto increased the production and now in spokane they're saying they're
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:17.400]  going to spend 300 million dollars to keep the pcb's from entering the river
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:21.560]  system they're now suing monsanto over this so we see this happening
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:24.920]  all the time well they spend 300 million trying to clean up the river and they
[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:29.240]  spend another 300 million as a fine to the federal government for example if
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:31.640]  they say you've been doing this is something really wrong so
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:36.520]  there's 600 million dollars now to us as that you know that's a big deal to them
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:40.840]  that's pocket change that's right when you're talking about 23 and 30 billion
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:44.760]  dollars around the world and besides but we're getting off lucky there they're
[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:47.320]  only here they're destroying the environment
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:50.520]  monsanto has been sued all around the world for killing people
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:54.200]  okay and that's not even to mention
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:58.120]  there's some people who've died from breathing their stuff or
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:27:02.200]  toxic water and that's not even to mention the 20 or 30
[02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:06.760]  thousand indian farmers who've committed suicide because they got sold as
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:10.840]  monsanto GMO stuff GMO and seeds and stuff and it
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:14.600]  didn't work and they needed more water and they went broke and they've
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.800]  committed suicide and before they come in and say
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:20.920]  when they cross pollinate and contaminate their crops they say
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:25.000]  now you owe us royalties on this it's not a trespass yeah it's a copyright
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.160]  infringement and we've had the supreme court
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:30.200]  essentially uphold that and of course clarence commas used to be a monsanto
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.880]  lawyer so it all works out really well we had watch right right now several
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.880]  states are have already legalized marijuana right
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:42.040]  okay and already a lot of the wealthy guys are jumping in trying to buy land
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:46.680]  so they can grow that okay the US government has a patent
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:51.080]  on medical marijuana maybe that's why now they're getting more and more
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:54.520]  lenient about it and i'll bet you anything it ends up in the hands of
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:28:00.120]  a large corporation probably monsanto and then they'll have a patented pot
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:03.800]  and then if you grow some and they can show that yours
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:08.520]  look similar to theirs then they sue you because you're using their patented
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:12.200]  seeds and crop oh yeah they're already doing that on food crops right
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:14.840]  the only way we're going to get out of this of course is if we have the uh
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:18.680]  freedom to innovate and there's a story that i think is interesting i'll just
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:21.880]  pass on real quickly to people it's on trueactivist.com
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:24.840]  this mycologist that's somebody who studies mushrooms holds a patent that
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.400]  could destroy monsanto let's certainly hope so
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:30.760]  they say paul stamets has figured out how to use mother nature to safely control
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:35.080]  over 200 000 species of insects uh they say that this is a patent that he's
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:38.200]  had since 2006 i don't know if this is being suppressed or what
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:41.720]  or maybe maybe there's nothing to it i don't know we'll all look at it
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:44.600]  but what it does is kind of interesting this these particular
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:51.320]  uh uh mushrooms will basically uh draw insects to them when the insects eat
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:56.120]  this the insects basically turn into fungi themselves from the inside out
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:59.480]  so this is not something that gets into your food this is not something where
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.840]  they had to genetically modify your food so they could then spray
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:07.000]  glyphosate on it okay which is what monsanto does doesn't put any kind of
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.160]  toxic pesticides into it because that's a problem with a lot of their gmo stuff is
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:16.600]  that they systemically add these chemicals into the uh food itself so
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:20.200]  you can't even wash it off it's in there systemically it's not even on the surface
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:23.640]  well all i can say is if that's true paul better watch himself because he's
[02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:27.640]  level i have a one car accident that's true that's true we've seen that many
[02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:30.920]  times haven't we it's nothing to joke about folks it actually does
[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:34.520]  happen and it seriously does it's not just a joke say what it's going to be
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:37.480]  right back with jim mars we're also going to take some of your calls if you

[02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:08.600]  no one could have seen it coming well this was not true back then and it is
[02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:13.880]  not true today if you were looking for the truth in 2007 the average
[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:18.920]  investor had ample warning from many sources of what was to come
[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:22.600]  for several years and in particular the last 12 months
[02:30:22.600 --> 02:30:26.440]  the imf and the bank for international settlements

[02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:36.920]  that pension funds could pose a systematic risk
[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:41.400]  in june of this year the uk telegraph ran an article that said the world is
[02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:44.760]  defenseless against the next financial crisis
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:48.360]  after a warning from the bank of international settlements

[02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:26.280]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this thursday august 6 2015 i'm david
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:30.040]  knighten joining me in studio is jim mars an award-winning journalist and
[02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:34.440]  author we're talking about his book here population control how corporate owners
[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:39.160]  are killing us we were talking about one of the fallacies that they sell us over
[02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:43.240]  population in the last couple of segments i want to move to another one
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:48.120]  that we were talking about here in your book peak oil tell us about the fallacy
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:51.880]  of peak oil jim well peak oil was uh
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:56.280]  determined way back there in the 1950s by a
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:02.280]  academia named hubert and hubert decided that by the year 2000 we were
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:06.920]  going to run out of oil you know there's uh it's first off
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:10.440]  actually you go back and there's a huge controversy over what is oil
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:16.360]  anyway um you know we've all been taught that this is dinosaurs and and ferns
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:21.320]  that are crunched under the earth and built up by millions of years and it
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:24.600]  produces this black gooey stuff that we can respond a lot of money at the
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:27.320]  world's fairs right exactly they created the
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:31.880]  sinclair dino lo gavi that's all about that narrative but the problem is some
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:36.360]  of the so-called depleted oil uh reservoirs around the world are
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:40.120]  refilling and uh i've spoke with some scientists
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:45.640]  including some russian scientists who say that uh it is not fossil fuel it is
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:49.560]  a hydrogen cracking process that takes place deep within the earth
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:53.640]  and it just oozes up and then fills up these cavities
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:57.720]  and the reason they thought it was organic was because back in 1800s when
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:00.520]  they first discovered oil and how could be used to
[02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:04.520]  to grease the wheels of the industrial revolution they studied it they found
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:08.360]  organic bits in it so that's where they come up with the idea that it's
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:12.200]  uh originates has crushed plants and animal life you know
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:16.440]  but in reality it's a it's a it's the blood life blood of the planet
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:19.400]  and it comes up fills up these old cavities where
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:23.560]  the cavemen had lived and and cave lines and everything else and plants got in
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:25.560]  there and this is where it picked up the bow
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:29.160]  but that's a whole controversy itself but it's always been about political
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:32.520]  power i remember going back and reading a biography of john d
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:36.280]  of j.d rockefeller okay how did he get his money well he
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:39.160]  was of the age that he should have been fighting in the civil war but he paid
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:42.440]  somebody take his place and they had just discovered oil in
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:45.000]  pennsylvania and they thought this is the only place in the world where this
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.480]  exists and he goes up there and got control the
[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:52.680]  refineries up there not only that but he worked tandem with uh the mr
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:55.240]  herriman who was the railroad guy owned all the
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:59.320]  railroads and they made a deal and anybody else who tried to get in
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:01.880]  their oil business couldn't ship their oil
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:05.080]  cheaper than rockefeller because he had a deal with the guy that owned the railroad
[02:36:05.080 --> 02:36:07.960]  that's right and it's been you know i mean first they thought it was only in
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:10.520]  pennsylvania then they discovered in texas like oh no
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:14.040]  something i'm gonna find a way to like you said with the railroad or anything to
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:17.880]  get the refinery monopoly in in ohio then it broke out in the middle east and
[02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:21.240]  it's like now what are we gonna do i know i got the end of the war
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:24.920]  well what happened in the middle east was a bunch of russians uh got together
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.840]  and said we need to create zionism yeah so we can have
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.600]  we'll say we need a homeland in the middle east but actually we can get our
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.280]  an old and the oil rich middle east but the and the things going on today and
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:38.760]  this leads us back to the idea of peak oil
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:42.760]  it's it's a fallacy it's not true uh anybody tries to tell you that we're
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:46.920]  running out of oil give them three words back in rock formation
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:52.440]  b a k k e n check it out that is a huge underground reservoir of raw petroleum
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:56.200]  that has not been tapped it's under north dakota montana into
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:58.840]  canada and the experts have said that there's
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:02.840]  enough petroleum underground there to last us at increased
[02:37:02.840 --> 02:37:07.160]  rates of consumption for the next 2000 years
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:11.080]  okay when you were here last i i showed you that magazine it was time or news
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:14.440]  week 1979 remember right had it plotted out
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:17.720]  eight point seven years are going to be out of oil that's right other you know
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:20.520]  nine point six years where we're going to be out of gas and i think that even
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:24.440]  then they said it was going to be 500 years before we ran out of coal
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:27.960]  okay they didn't have clean technology to use coal but they do now
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:31.320]  and that's something that i mean not even the back in oil fields you could
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:34.920]  talk about the the coal reservoirs we got but there's so many different places
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:38.680]  that we could go for for oil resources and as you pointed out you know that
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:42.120]  the peak oil is something that's been sold to us heavily
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:46.440]  not just by the corporations but by the cia because it is a way for them
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:50.120]  to exert control through their wars it gives them
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:55.080]  an excuse to have wars and it's bogus and on top of being bogus it's it's
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:59.400]  killing us through the pollution you know we don't need to be dependent on
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:03.240]  oil you know we could be turning to solar geothermal
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:08.760]  tidal power you know in all kinds of things but of course
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:13.560]  well nick like tesla showed us how to how to get
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:17.640]  basically free energy but it's all been squashed
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:21.640]  by the new world order people who want to keep control over their monopoly of
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:25.480]  petroleum and the main thing about this
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:30.680]  fallacy of peak oil is that when you really get down to it the idea that we
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:34.520]  have to find more oil and gas is the whole
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:39.560]  reason behind fracking which is now becoming a big hot topic
[02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:43.400]  of people and fracking by the way in case you
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:46.840]  really don't know is hydraulic fracturing where they take
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:52.040]  water up to eight million gallons per well and there's like 500 000 wells in
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:56.840]  the united states and they add up to 40 000 chemicals including
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:01.000]  deadly stuff like uranium and and toxic metals and stuff
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:04.040]  they kind of have somewhere to put it yeah i mean they pump it down in the
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:07.160]  ground under pressure supply and charges for that
[02:39:07.160 --> 02:39:11.640]  well if the if these fracking wells don't pan out and get stopped they will
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:14.920]  they'll probably put in our drinking water as big as we and tell us it'll
[02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:19.400]  help us sleep or something you know so so they pump this water in there and
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.000]  then the thing is that but then after they open up the cracks
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.360]  underground and by the way they put steel ball bearings down there to keep the
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:30.360]  cracks open all right and this is led of course to
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:35.400]  unnatural earthquakes all around the country yeah
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:41.240]  in oklahoma you know 23 years ago they had maybe one earthquake a year
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:46.680]  and now they're now they had about 30 just in the first months of 2015
[02:39:46.680 --> 02:39:50.280]  sam you're just a conspiracy theorist yeah i'm a conspiracy theorist
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:53.080]  but the whole idea is we gotta have when you see something that's unusual like
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:56.120]  that you start to say hmm this is something that's new
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:59.080]  and then we have this other thing over here that's also new
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:02.840]  maybe there's a relationship with it that's how investigations start right
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:05.320]  right i mean you look at this kind of stuff and you try to it's like okay
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:08.920]  well let's let's explore this further i mean every hypothesis every
[02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:11.720]  criminal scientific hypothesis every criminal investigation
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:15.000]  always starts with a theory but of course what they're always
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:18.920]  say it's a conspiracy theory yeah you know what my definition of a conspiracy
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:23.080]  theorist is don't you okay now that's a person who questions
[02:40:23.080 --> 02:40:25.880]  proven liars yeah that's right yeah the government
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.160]  in other words yeah because it's the government that weaponized that term
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:32.280]  is the government created that term in the wake of the kennedy assassination and
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:35.880]  they have used it ever since it seems to be effectively working i mean that's
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:39.160]  they can keep using the same playbook because nobody's catching on to the
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:41.320]  playbook for the most part that's just a way to
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:45.080]  to dismiss somebody's argument i your conspiracy theorist right yeah
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:49.480]  that's exactly right so here here too the biggest arguments we have now
[02:40:49.480 --> 02:40:52.920]  oh but before we finish up on fracking here's the thing bothers me
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:57.000]  up in dentin county which is next county over from where i live and we're in
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.200]  north texas university university of north texas
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:04.200]  and uh you know they got together and they passed a local ordinance is no more
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:07.640]  fracking here because we're having damage we're having wells being
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:12.200]  polluted mm-hmm and what happens is uh governor abbott pushed through
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:17.160]  legislation here in austin that says local authorities cannot ban
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:19.880]  fracking well see that happens everywhere that happens typically with
[02:41:19.880 --> 02:41:23.160]  monsanto right we saw the farmers who really understand that when they go in
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:27.400]  and they have these labeling referenda the people are very easily to see
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:29.960]  typically they come in and 90 percent of the people say yeah i'd like to know
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:33.320]  what's in my food yeah why not have that on the label and they come in and say
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:36.040]  no you really don't want that on me let me tell you why you don't want to have
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.560]  that on you it's going to be so expensive you won't be able to afford to eat
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:42.760]  because it's going to be so expensive for us to tell you what's the ingredients
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:46.920]  in your food right and so then they might have to change a father
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.640]  or a letter or two but when they go into they've had success when they went into
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.840]  a small community a city a county area and they and it was a rural area where
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.440]  the farmers understood about the trespass of these
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:04.760]  monsanto gmo things and they voted to keep it out and it happened in hawai
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:08.040]  and monsanto spent like eight million dollars to stop it they
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:10.920]  still could not stop that because the people there
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:13.560]  understood the problem and they couldn't be deceived with these slick
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:17.240]  television ads right so what they do unlike people in california exactly so
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:19.160]  why they do they shut it down at the state level
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:22.600]  yeah and then we've got the labeling laws being shut down just got with a dark
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:26.600]  act the dark shut down at the national level of course that hasn't gone through
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:30.520]  the senate uh people don't give up on that yet you need to contact your
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:35.480]  senator come uh you know gmo labeling what about
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:39.400]  freedom do you not understand you know what is it what the very least prime for
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:43.320]  us to know what's in our food exactly when we talk about gmo
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:46.760]  we don't know what they're going to do in the future right we don't know it's
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.200]  even if you believed that everything that they've done genetically
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:54.200]  right now this is transgenic genetic modification this isn't just selective
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:56.920]  breeding but wouldn't you want to know in the
[02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:59.400]  future if they're going to start doing some of this wouldn't you want to know
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:02.520]  that's in your food but they shut it down at the national level and then just in
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:05.720]  case that doesn't work and because there's some countries that have said we
[02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:08.760]  want to know what's in our food or they have banned gmo they're going to use
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.840]  these secretly negotiated treaties the trans-pacific the transatlantic
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:16.040]  partnerships the tt tt ip that's why they know when people
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:18.840]  know what's in them that's right they don't want you to know what's in the
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:20.760]  laws and they don't want you to know what's in the food it's kind of like
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:23.720]  what bizmark said right you don't want to know what's in the sausage and you
[02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:26.680]  don't want to know how the legislation gets made right and so that's what
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:29.080]  they're doing they don't want us to know what's in our food and they don't want
[02:43:29.080 --> 02:43:31.560]  us to know how they're creating this treaty and
[02:43:31.560 --> 02:43:36.360]  david i'm sorry but to me that makes a mockery of the idea that we are a free
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:40.680]  and democratic people oh absolutely you know because to me a free and democratic
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:44.520]  people is a people who can actually study an issue
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:49.240]  uh and and look at it from all sides and then
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:53.480]  vote intelligently not through secret under the table deals
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:59.480]  or people who have are treated like adults who have informed consent yes
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:02.040]  of course when you look at what they're doing with vaccines they're trying to
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:04.280]  take away our informed consent left and right
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:07.640]  dictating to us arguing from authority ignoring any
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:11.240]  arguments from the other side demonizing people would say that but of
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:14.120]  course what should we expect when they have been
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:17.880]  alternating our you know messing up our water with fluoride
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:20.840]  without our informed consent if they can do that to our drinking water why can't
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:23.480]  they force us the next step take a shot take a shot
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:26.920]  exactly and what a lot of people don't realize is that they keep saying well
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:30.840]  yeah but vaccinations are harmless you know as they're perfectly safe
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:34.920]  well if that's so then why back in the 80s did they pass the
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:39.800]  vaccine uh uh injury compensation fund okay which
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:43.800]  number one absolves the pharmaceutical corporations of any liability
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:48.920]  if their vaccines go bad okay and if you have a child who suddenly has a
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:53.880]  vaccination then turns autistic or even worse other medical problems
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:57.000]  you have to hire a law you have to go to the federal government you have to go
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.000]  through this uh vaccine uh conversation fund you
[02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.320]  have to prove up and prove up you know it takes more money more time which most
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:10.200]  people do not have and even with that rigorous process
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:13.800]  the government to this day has already paid out over three
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:17.240]  billion dollars to families whose children have been
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.240]  harmed by vaccines and yet they what would they have to take away
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:24.360]  liability why would they have to give them legal immunity
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:27.960]  if these were safe and if they're safe why have they paid out three billion
[02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:31.720]  dollars for vaccine injuries in other words now i'm not
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:35.480]  totally against vaccines i mean if i get cut with a rusty nail i probably want
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:39.720]  to run get a tetanus shot you know but but this this song
[02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:43.320]  i know the well that's we'll get it i want to know what's in it and i know i
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:46.360]  can't get the truth and labeling even about my food i'm not too certain about
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:50.280]  the vaccines either and that's the truth of it that's the people the people who
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:54.520]  argue against vaccines i understand their arguments completely
[02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:57.880]  it's not even particularly the vaccines it's the additives
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:03.480]  yes their marisol and and uh i don't know but even if you support it and when
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:07.240]  we saw this discussion in california there was a doctor that testified there
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:11.240]  he he encourages his patients to get vaccines he takes them himself he
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:14.760]  believes in them but he said don't force people to do
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:18.440]  exact i mean that you can't take away people's informed consent that's the
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:22.040]  path to medical tyranny that's what that that enables
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:25.880]  things like we saw in Auschwitz with the os of mingala saying this is for the
[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:29.000]  good of all humanity that i am torturing these people
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:32.680]  okay i mean we saw that the japanese scientists did that american scientists
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:35.960]  have done that at tuskegee and everything i was gonna say don't forget the tuskegee
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:40.760]  experiment we've been doing that here too exactly so i mean it's it's not limited
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:43.640]  to any particular nationality or country
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:47.400]  we've seen this done over and over again for the good of all humanity and they
[02:46:47.400 --> 02:46:51.320]  said at the nuremberg trials we're not going to accept that we're going to
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:55.640]  draw the ethical line here that you can never do even with a person's consent
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:58.760]  you can't do things that are going to harm them but one of the first stories i
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:03.080]  had when i came here jim was looking at uh some tests that were being conducted
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:07.400]  by the epa they were trying to up the fine particulate matter
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:10.440]  regulations and so what they did to make that happen
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:13.960]  they deliberately searched for people had respiratory heart issues and they hooked
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:18.200]  them up to a diesel exhaust pipe to an elaborate technique they didn't know
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:21.080]  that's exactly where it went to them but that's essentially it a hose that
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:23.720]  runs up comes into a little room and does that to them
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:27.240]  and you're looking for an event yeah and we were not able
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:31.800]  to stop and get a restraining order from a judge so they continued to do that
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.240]  and then they went to california and they selectively looked for young black
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:38.520]  teenagers who had respiratory issues and so forth and then they came back to
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:41.800]  north carolina and did it again so we've got our own government
[02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:45.160]  violating the nuremberg prohibitions for ethics because
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:49.800]  they had said on the the head of the epa lisa jackson had said
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:52.440]  i'm not talking about making people sick i'm talking about killing them i'm
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:55.080]  saying that more people are dying from fine particulate matter than die from
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:59.080]  cancer and they expose people to 70 times that in these experiments so it's like
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:02.840]  what's going on here but that's our government when you take away people's
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:06.760]  informed consent treat them like animals you're in a very dangerous
[02:48:06.760 --> 02:48:11.000]  situation well in in my book population control what i really got really upset
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:14.840]  about and i think you would be too is the way that they're treating our veterans
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:18.760]  yes they're experimenting on them they're giving them experimental drugs they
[02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:22.920]  the amount of uh ssri drugs or psychiatric drugs
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.800]  have gone from like uh 10 years ago or 15 years ago the military was spending
[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:31.960]  like seven billion dollars on those psychiatric drugs today it's up to 40
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:35.640]  billion and uh you know they they go to them and say
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:39.400]  so you're over in iraq and you're having a tough time of it because it's 120
[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:42.440]  degrees and by the way your diet coke and diet
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:46.680]  dr peppers are sitting there in the sun baking and turning to formaldehyde
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:51.160]  because of the asper team in it and then they don't feel good so they go to the
[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:53.560]  medic and the medics is hearing and gives them
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:56.920]  anti-depressants and everything else of course they've seen this going on a
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:00.120]  long time days of 70th anniversary of Hiroshima what they do they're american
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:03.640]  soldiers they we've seen the videos where they took them out and used them as
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:06.600]  guinea pigs marched them right up to within a few hundred yards of the
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:11.000]  atomic bomb blast and said here uh don't look at the blast you know then during
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:15.880]  the iraq war depleted uranium shells they had said these things are dangerous
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:19.640]  when i and then they they used depleted uranium in
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:23.560]  ways that they had previously prohibited and so now we're seeing these
[02:49:23.560 --> 02:49:26.760]  types of uh things from our own soldiers not to mention the
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:30.360]  people in feluja the massive birth defects that have happened there
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:34.760]  yeah and by the way you mentioned uh you mentioned the the uh that fluoride some
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:39.720]  fluoride is a waste product you know of aluminum or a byproduct and uh but
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:44.440]  what i what i detail here in population control is how it was also a deadly
[02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.720]  waste product of the manufacturer of atomic weapons
[02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:51.720]  and they didn't know how to get rid of it so they put in our water supply and we
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:55.400]  drink it yeah how brilliant is that and by the way for some of you who think
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:59.480]  maybe i'm just a conspiracy theory and and go talk to your dentist because he'll
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:03.160]  tell you oh he's really safe it's great because that's what he's been told
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:06.440]  by the american dental association who was hoodwinked by
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:10.840]  one or two controversial studies but if you think this is just a bunch of
[02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:15.000]  who he get a whole of a toothpaste that says with fluoride look on the back
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.720]  read carefully the little print and it says if anyone under six year old
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:24.040]  happens to swallow this call the cdc call the poison control
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:29.320]  it's a poison why would anybody voluntarily put poison
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.720]  in their system absolutely why would they well the answer is in your book isn't
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:36.840]  it jim population control the people who tell us that over
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:40.680]  population is one of the key issues before us and we have to reduce it

[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:24.680]  joining me right now is jim mars award-winning journalist and author
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:27.720]  we've been talking about his book population control and we are taking
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:32.200]  calls we had just gotten to alex in virginia we ran out of time alex go
[03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:38.680]  ahead with your question hi um all right so when i used to go to school in
[03:00:38.680 --> 03:00:41.800]  florida it was in pretty much in the ghetto in south florida
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:45.320]  and um they used to have cracker day
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:49.080]  basically it was when all the black kids would beat up on whatever white kids
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:52.440]  they wanted to and they would either throw eggs at us
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:57.000]  they would either jump us um but i luckily i never
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.200]  actually got jumped but a lot of my friends did and stuff and so people
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:02.520]  would stay home it just i just thought it was
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:05.560]  interesting because i never hear any stories like that and i spoke to a
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:09.160]  friend of mine who actually is from florida about the same age and
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:12.920]  same thing used to happen to him in miami they had cracker day also
[03:01:12.920 --> 03:01:16.840]  but they had their own little like gang so it was interesting yeah the the
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:19.880]  narrative that they're feeding everybody in terms of white privilege to try to
[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:23.880]  get things going is of course uh black people can't be racist that's what
[03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:27.160]  they're they're told in the right that's that so you know it doesn't cut both
[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:29.880]  ways but uh well i'm not going to get into it but
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:34.040]  if you want to find out the truth i would go to the fbi crime statistics
[03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:39.880]  and compare the black on white crime versus the white on black crime just
[03:01:39.880 --> 03:01:44.600]  check them out check out those no yeah did you have a question for jam on ufo's
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:49.320]  you said yes and then my other comic kind of question was um i've been looking
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:53.320]  into the whole ufo thing for a long time since i was a little
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:56.680]  because i used to have you know bad dreams and all kinds of weird stuff
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:01.400]  happening um but through my research it seems that like
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:06.040]  the alien thing might also be not aliens from another planet but
[03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:10.840]  like uh entities that are here like if you want to say demons or any kind of
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:15.800]  thing um if you look into like jox valley jox valley the ufo
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:21.000]  researcher or john keel um these guys they've like come up with
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:24.760]  the basically the theory that that's what it seems like it is it's since the
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:28.920]  beginning of time how people have spoken about these demons or
[03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:32.360]  let's get to jim's comments because he's written a best-selling
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:38.920]  non-fiction book alien agenda right uh and you're absolutely right uh you
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:42.600]  i have lived through the evolution of thought on ufo's you go back to the
[03:02:42.600 --> 03:02:45.880]  fifties and uh the most of the people the vast
[03:02:45.880 --> 03:02:49.400]  majority of people eighty ninety percent of the population disbelieve there's
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:53.800]  any life outside the earth the few people who did believe said well the
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:58.440]  big question was do they come from mars or do they come from venus you know by
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:02.840]  the sixties seventies we'd progress a little bit we'd land it on the moon we'd
[03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:07.560]  you know we knew more so the question became do they come from alpha centauri
[03:03:07.560 --> 03:03:10.920]  or do they come from zeta reticula four you know
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:15.240]  and now today we've even progressed further and now it's do they come from
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:19.480]  space or do they come from another dimension do they come from another time
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:22.120]  okay and i'm here to tell you the answer is
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:26.840]  yes all of the above that's uh for one thing
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:31.080]  there are those who still argue that ufo's are nothing more than government
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:34.840]  secret test craft okay and i'll be the first to say that a good
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:38.520]  number of sightings that's probably is the explanation
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:42.920]  but not all of them and the key thing is is that if you really investigate
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:46.200]  you find out that the ufo phenomena has been with us
[03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:51.400]  i say us with humankind all the way back through recorded history
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:55.560]  the viamas of the hindus that are recorded in the hindu vedas that's some
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:03:59.400]  of the oldest writing in the world you've got ezekiel a wheel in the old
[03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:02.280]  testament i mean you know you can keep going and not
[03:04:02.280 --> 03:04:05.720]  right on up to the cattle mutilations and the crop circles and
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:10.920]  everything else that's going on today so uh i would simply say this uh if any of
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:14.200]  you out there say wow that's stupid i'm not even gonna
[03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:18.200]  consider that then i'm tell you right now you'll never be able to figure out
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:21.720]  what's going on in the world because you're tossing out a big piece of the
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:24.360]  puzzle absolutely well i'm a christian so i believe in
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:28.760]  extraterrestrial intelligence and life well she mentioned demons you know
[03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:33.240]  who knows there are there are uh there is a uh metaphysical
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:36.200]  aspect the whole thing that's true but david it comes down to
[03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:39.720]  her interpretation if you and i walking through the woods and a little green
[03:04:39.720 --> 03:04:44.680]  guy runs in front of us you know you may say uh i saw an alien and i may say no
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:48.600]  it was a leprechaun you know there's something there but we could
[03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:52.600]  differ on how we perceive it true that's true well that's all the
[03:04:52.600 --> 03:04:56.200]  time we have today sorry to the callers that are still on hold uh jim mars
