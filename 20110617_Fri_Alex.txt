[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:36.560]  Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Friday June 17th broadcast my name is Aaron
[00:36.560 --> 00:41.760]  Dykes I'm sitting in while Alex Jones is away on story but of course it's a
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.440]  huge news day once again we are slipping tiptoeing into World War three as the
[00:47.440 --> 00:52.720]  heat is on for Libya we confirmed earlier in the week that military personnel
[00:52.720 --> 00:58.960]  have seen a flare-up in Libya plans to mobilize big troops by October and
[00:58.960 --> 01:03.400]  September really scary stuff as the rest of the Middle East continues to fan
[01:03.400 --> 01:09.800]  into flames and possible World War three begins to start also on the immediate
[01:09.800 --> 01:14.080]  front is the Greek debt crisis and the possibility of that spreading to
[01:14.080 --> 01:19.600]  Portugal Spain Ireland host of other countries the US of course also vulnerable
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.280]  we are also only a few days out from Bilderberg the 2011 meeting I traveled
[01:25.280 --> 01:31.040]  with Paul Watson to Samarit Switzerland he'll join me in about 30 minutes so
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.000]  we're going to recap some of the most exciting stuff talk about some of the
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.200]  stories and we'll also be joined by the Info Craig German activist Alex
[01:41.200 --> 01:46.400]  Manesh also coming up later in the broadcast Bob Chapman but for now we
[01:46.400 --> 01:51.560]  are looking at everything cyber the possibility of a false flag attack maybe
[01:51.560 --> 01:55.920]  to initiate this World War three scenario possibly just to help them
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.320]  clamp down on the Internet it's just one of the many important things that we
[02:00.320 --> 02:06.040]  know came directly out of the Bilderberg agenda in 2011 I've got all those
[02:06.040 --> 02:10.640]  details coming up we're going to go deep into it and why they have so many tech
[02:10.640 --> 02:15.400]  people at Bilderberg now everyone from Bill Gates to some of the Facebook
[02:15.400 --> 02:22.000]  founders to some of the most important PayPal executives to the cyber people
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.280]  Keith Alexander head of a post created in the United States just last year I
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.040]  believe to deal with the cyber attacks one of the most important people
[02:32.040 --> 02:36.280]  shaping up in Bilderberg was not an attendee this year but the heir apparent
[02:36.280 --> 02:41.560]  to David Rockefeller he of course is getting quite old and frail his 97th
[02:41.560 --> 02:47.120]  birthday occurred actually during this meeting but his heir apparent John D
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.840]  Rockefeller the fourth better known as J Rockefeller the senator from West
[02:50.840 --> 02:55.040]  Virginia he has been incredibly hot on the cyber issue for more than two years
[02:55.040 --> 02:59.120]  now saying things are so dangerous we should have never even invented the
[02:59.120 --> 03:03.880]  Internet I of course disagree we have to preserve the Internet at all cost and
[03:03.880 --> 03:10.440]  fight for it we're going to get way into the Libyan war Robert Gates outgoing
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.480]  warning about the subject and incoming Leon Panetta who wants to have even more
[03:15.480 --> 03:20.040]  secret wars he wants the CIA to take control of certain aspects of defense
[03:20.040 --> 03:25.680]  spending and defense authorization so we can do more assassinations targeted
[03:25.680 --> 03:30.400]  killings covert operations all like the bin Laden raid that went real well
[03:30.400 --> 03:37.240]  which was of course almost entirely contrived and made up also we're going
[03:37.240 --> 03:41.680]  to get as I already mentioned way further deeper into the secret Bilderberg
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.120]  agenda leaked by the mole some of the information posted on their official
[03:46.120 --> 03:51.320]  website and we will cover many many of the attendees at this year's meeting all
[03:51.320 --> 03:55.760]  that is coming up after the break we also are going to debut a video Alex left
[03:55.760 --> 04:00.520]  us with as he left to cover his story about the initiating World War three
[04:00.520 --> 04:05.840]  how dangerous it is that everything is happening at once and they've they have
[04:05.840 --> 04:13.000]  decided to go hot in Libya not just so-called advisors and background troops
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.360]  and special forces but actual ground troops are rumored and confirmed by
[04:18.360 --> 04:24.280]  many of the military callers we've had this week so we really hope things don't
[04:24.280 --> 04:30.360]  heat up into a bigger war as America now takes on about five wars including Iraq
[04:30.360 --> 04:38.320]  Afghanistan Libya Yemen Pakistan and a whole lot more on the way that's all on
[04:38.320 --> 04:41.000]  the other side of the break you don't want to miss this broadcast even though
[04:41.000 --> 04:57.640]  I'm sitting in Aaron Dykes infowars.com back on the other side
[05:00.200 --> 05:04.480]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[05:04.480 --> 05:08.440]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions yet
[05:08.440 --> 05:11.840]  many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has
[05:11.840 --> 05:16.680]  been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body my
[05:16.680 --> 05:20.280]  name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.520]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic
[05:24.520 --> 05:28.920]  silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices
[05:28.920 --> 05:34.160]  needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this
[05:34.160 --> 05:40.320]  includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for
[05:40.320 --> 05:44.280]  the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven minute video tour of the
[05:44.280 --> 05:50.320]  silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the
[05:50.320 --> 05:55.160]  silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any questions you

[06:02.120 --> 06:06.000]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[06:06.000 --> 06:09.760]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[06:09.760 --> 06:13.720]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[06:13.720 --> 06:18.080]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[06:18.080 --> 06:22.520]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[06:22.520 --> 06:27.280]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:27.280 --> 06:31.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:31.040 --> 06:34.680]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.680 --> 06:39.080]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:39.080 --> 06:42.200]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[06:42.200 --> 06:45.880]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[09:31.680 --> 09:35.240]  that ready yeah let's play that please
[09:36.600 --> 09:44.920]  my friends we stand at the precipice the entire world is rushing towards world
[09:44.920 --> 09:51.760]  war three by any measurement or definition the private offshore banks
[09:51.760 --> 09:57.480]  that dominate Europe and the United States are invading countries all over
[09:57.480 --> 10:04.120]  the Middle East North Africa and trying to start a war as well with Pakistan this
[10:04.120 --> 10:08.360]  is all happening as the world economy is imploded and as the private central
[10:08.360 --> 10:11.960]  banks openly announced a private corporate bank of the world that our
[10:11.960 --> 10:17.120]  carbon taxes will be paid into our sources inside the Pentagon in DC and
[10:17.120 --> 10:22.080]  at Fort Hood Texas as well as others have confirmed that major armored
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.720]  divisions out of Fort Hood and other bases are set to be sent late in
[10:26.720 --> 10:33.760]  September into October into Libya a full-scale ground war meanwhile Obama
[10:33.760 --> 10:38.880]  comes out and says he doesn't need any authorization from Congress and that
[10:38.880 --> 10:47.680]  Libya is not a war now he's threatening to go into Sudan they've got warships
[10:47.680 --> 10:53.080]  off the coast of Syria and our media and senators are openly calling for war the
[10:53.080 --> 10:58.560]  Russians are threatening to respond now the CIA has expanded drone attacks in
[10:58.560 --> 11:05.520]  Yemen and that government supposed ally is toppled the former darling of the
[11:05.520 --> 11:11.840]  establishment hazy mubarak the 31-year dictator of Egypt was overthrown by a
[11:11.840 --> 11:19.200]  US British slash Europe backed military coup and citizens are being arrested in
[11:19.200 --> 11:25.200]  mass no protest is allowed this is amazing al Qaeda backed forces in the
[11:25.200 --> 11:32.600]  east of Libya are now being augmented by US and British special forces but it
[11:32.600 --> 11:37.560]  doesn't stop there Pakistan months ago told the United States stop your
[11:37.560 --> 11:41.560]  thousands of drone attacks our country doesn't care it's going forward with a
[11:41.560 --> 11:48.640]  supposed ally driving him into the hands of China and Russia US warships have
[11:48.640 --> 11:53.480]  entered the Black Sea Russia is saying that this appears to be a provocation
[11:53.480 --> 12:01.240]  China and Russia are warning that wider conflicts could erupt from this the word
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.960]  we're getting from our military sources and officers is that they've been told
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.720]  that basically a giant war in North Africa the Middle East and Central Asia
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.960]  is about to be launched as a political smokescreen for the financial collapse
[12:17.960 --> 12:21.920]  that's happening in the West because they know populations in Europe England
[12:21.920 --> 12:25.880]  and the United States and Canada will rally around the government as the
[12:25.880 --> 12:31.560]  Depression intensifies if they're in the middle of a war also the
[12:31.560 --> 12:36.280]  establishment can use stage terror attacks or provocateur attacks or real
[12:36.280 --> 12:41.840]  attacks launched by Muammar Gaddafi as a last-ditch effort to hold on to power
[12:41.840 --> 12:46.200]  that can then be used to take our liberties domestically here at home
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.400]  we're seeing the rollout of the TSA on the streets of America now we're seeing
[12:50.400 --> 12:56.560]  open spy groups being formed through pastors and lawyers and community
[12:56.560 --> 13:01.120]  organizers to spy on their fellow Americans all the classical forms of
[13:01.120 --> 13:08.040]  tyranny are now unfolding and a giant multi-region war that will undoubtedly
[13:08.040 --> 13:13.880]  suck in China and Russia is now being launched that's why they gave President
[13:13.880 --> 13:17.920]  Barack Obama right after he got into office the peace price they knew that
[13:17.920 --> 13:21.480]  all these new wars were going to be launched but that they would be called
[13:21.480 --> 13:29.520]  peace this is Obama's global peace tour first he sold as this anti-war liberal
[13:29.520 --> 13:34.240]  the planet bows down before him after eight years of warmongering and lies
[13:34.240 --> 13:41.600]  about WMD's by George W. Bush and then Obama launches new conflicts across the
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.560]  globe but dubs them as humanitarian and bringing peace and tells the world giant
[13:47.560 --> 13:53.800]  mushroom clouds and huge buildings being blown into pieces is not war it is
[13:53.800 --> 14:00.160]  humanitarian liberation and the controlled corporate dinosaur media said
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.920]  you don't understand these new wars are not wars these are kinetic actions and
[14:05.920 --> 14:12.480]  these are to bring peace we were told Al Qaeda were the good guys in the east of
[14:12.480 --> 14:17.280]  Libya going after Muammar Gaddafi we were told that bombing their cities and
[14:17.280 --> 14:23.960]  killing thousands was humanitarian and now we're told that a new war I'm sorry
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.240]  peace action needs to be launched against Syria and U.S. warships are
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.840]  waiting off the coast Obama says he's concerned about what's happening in
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.120]  Sudan and there might need to be a military bombardment there Yemen is
[14:38.120 --> 14:45.360]  being carpet bombed by hundreds of predator drones and the media says look
[14:45.360 --> 14:52.560]  at our peacemaker look at our king look at him our great new general Obama he
[14:52.560 --> 14:58.320]  doesn't need Congress for authority he has the United Nations ladies and
[14:58.320 --> 15:02.480]  gentlemen last year at Bilderberg and again just a few weeks ago at Bilderberg
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.720]  in St. Moritz in Switzerland our sources have been very accurate in the past have
[15:08.720 --> 15:14.240]  reported to us that this is part of a global destabilization program that is
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.760]  meant to lead to not just a multi-regional conflict North Africa
[15:18.760 --> 15:24.000]  Middle East Central and South Asia but to engulf China and Russia in
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.320]  destabilizing color revolutions but the globalist won't stop there they must
[15:29.320 --> 15:32.960]  destroy every nation-state they must destroy every currency they must
[15:32.960 --> 15:38.560]  destroy every economy so the entire world bows to this world government
[15:38.560 --> 15:44.400]  George Soros Ian program of order out of chaos and the private global banking
[15:44.400 --> 15:50.560]  cartel that you will pay your carbon taxes to it is happening meanwhile it
[15:50.560 --> 15:54.720]  has now been proven what we first reported last year that the Bureau of
[15:54.720 --> 16:00.080]  Alcohol Tobacco forums and explosives for the last two years knowingly helped
[16:00.080 --> 16:06.480]  ship semi-automatic firearms by the thousands to Mexico in an attempt to
[16:06.480 --> 16:10.200]  then track the weapons back into the United States and connect them to
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.960]  violence in Mexico so the federal government could call for a total ban on
[16:14.960 --> 16:21.240]  all semi-automatic firearms as they have now done this is incredible another
[16:21.240 --> 16:26.160]  example of stage terror another example of a frame-up this time targeting the
[16:26.160 --> 16:31.240]  Second Amendment and CNN the Houston Chronicle you name it has now reported
[16:31.240 --> 16:36.920]  on the fact that over 28,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the last two
[16:36.920 --> 16:43.040]  years that the Southwest in the United States is now more dangerous than the
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.240]  worst areas of Eastern Europe for kidnapping mass graves have been found
[16:47.240 --> 16:51.240]  all over Mexico and on the Texas and California Nevada border with dead
[16:51.240 --> 16:55.640]  children it's now been confirmed that Western trained US trained Los
[16:55.640 --> 17:01.160]  Zettis pull over buses full of Mexican civilians men women and children rape
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.240]  the women and kill them kill the old people and take the teenagers and have
[17:05.240 --> 17:09.840]  them fight to the death in gladiatorial games a form of trauma-based mind
[17:09.840 --> 17:15.560]  control they then take the winners and train them as assassins so understand
[17:15.560 --> 17:22.240]  more people are dying a year on the Texas Mexico border then died each year in
[17:22.240 --> 17:27.840]  Vietnam a true war is going on a completely collapsed society a failed
[17:27.840 --> 17:32.800]  state expanding into the United States and it's not even on the radar the media
[17:32.800 --> 17:36.280]  barely reports it they've got their own giant armored vehicles it's a full-on
[17:36.280 --> 17:41.240]  war financed by the criminal mega banks that are on record laundering more than
[17:41.240 --> 17:47.400]  376 billion dollars in just the last few years are waging a war of drug
[17:47.400 --> 17:52.240]  consolidation knocking out their competition in Mexico as the Latin
[17:52.240 --> 17:57.840]  American drugs are fed through southern North America World War 3 is here the
[17:57.840 --> 18:02.600]  whole world is going into crises the domestic police state is unfolding
[18:02.600 --> 18:08.320]  against the people of our republic we must take back Washington we must take
[18:08.320 --> 18:13.200]  back our states we must identify the fact that offshore private corporations
[18:13.200 --> 18:17.240]  have now hijacked our government and are using it as an instrument of global
[18:17.240 --> 18:22.200]  destabilization to bring in their world government on the ashes of our once
[18:22.200 --> 18:28.240]  free society all of you Democrats that loved rebuking Bush for war I certainly
[18:28.240 --> 18:32.240]  rebuked it as a constitutionalist but all of you that thought it was trendy to

[22:02.200 --> 22:06.640]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[22:06.640 --> 22:10.640]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[22:10.640 --> 22:14.560]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[22:14.560 --> 22:18.560]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[22:18.560 --> 22:23.120]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[22:23.120 --> 22:27.160]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.960]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[22:30.960 --> 22:34.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[22:34.560 --> 22:38.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[22:38.920 --> 22:42.040]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[24:11.560 --> 24:29.160]  we're back again on the Alex Jones show I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in again while
[24:29.160 --> 24:34.920]  Alex is away on assignment but we've just watched his video Obama launching
[24:34.920 --> 24:38.880]  World War three and unfortunately it hits all the right notes they are
[24:38.880 --> 24:45.920]  drawing the Middle East into the fan of flames they're you know drawing in all
[24:45.920 --> 24:50.800]  the powers what is a world war it's where everyone's so entangled they can't
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.120]  avoid what's going on obviously that makes sense for the Middle East region
[24:55.120 --> 25:01.040]  starting with the Arab Springs a few months back and Egypt and Tunisia
[25:01.040 --> 25:08.520]  drawing in Libya now Syria on the cusp of being drawn into war bombings now in
[25:08.520 --> 25:16.040]  Yemen tensions escalating in Pakistan drone killings civilians supposed acts
[25:16.040 --> 25:21.360]  of al-Qaeda going on still a presence in Iraq and Afghanistan when will we ever
[25:21.360 --> 25:27.040]  leave there it's just really disturbing how they're intentionally trying to
[25:27.040 --> 25:32.520]  escalate this stuff not only the reports as we publish earlier in the week on the
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.920]  15th of June US invasion of Libya set for October that's based directly on
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.080]  military personnel and troops calling in to warn us that they've heard word
[25:43.080 --> 25:47.800]  whether official or otherwise that we're going to be sitting in big-time
[25:47.800 --> 25:52.000]  troops and really heading for a hot war in Libya that despite the fact that
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.520]  Congress is trying to hold President Obama accountable for extending past
[25:56.520 --> 26:02.240]  the 60 days war power Obama's been very indignant said it's not necessary said
[26:02.240 --> 26:06.720]  the level of hostilities don't justify congressional approval for a war
[26:06.720 --> 26:11.760]  another war that America's been drawn into and that is only getting hotter and
[26:11.760 --> 26:19.800]  hotter further we've always known that if things go to Iran that it will most
[26:19.800 --> 26:24.760]  likely draw in both Russia and China possibly creating that World War 3
[26:24.760 --> 26:29.720]  scenario but as we heard the other day from Dr. Webster Tarpley it may not even
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.600]  take Iran sure they want to get to Iran they've asked themselves and public
[26:34.600 --> 26:39.920]  papers what passed to Persia a new approach for Iran was the document
[26:39.920 --> 26:45.520]  from outgoing Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Zbigniew Brzezinski one
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.960]  of our shadow overlords and even if they don't get to Iran anytime soon Libya
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.280]  may be enough for Russia and China to be drawn into a World War be incredibly
[26:56.280 --> 27:03.400]  disastrous meanwhile we have Robert Gates last week coincidentally during the
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.680]  Bilderberg conferences warning NATO warning Europe that they're not the
[27:07.680 --> 27:13.640]  allies they used to be unless they up there spending of defense is Robert
[27:13.640 --> 27:18.200]  Gates rebukes European allies in farewell speech Washington Post and
[27:18.200 --> 27:23.320]  this was from June 10th the first day of the Bilderberg conference or the second
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.480]  rather Defense Secretary Robert M Gates rebukes some of America's staunchest
[27:27.480 --> 27:32.160]  allies Friday saying the United States has a dwindling appetite to serve as the
[27:32.160 --> 27:35.480]  heavyweight partner in the military order that has underpinned the US
[27:35.480 --> 27:39.760]  relationship with Europe since the end of World War two an unusually stinging
[27:39.760 --> 27:44.520]  speech made in his valedictory visit to Europe before he retires at the end of
[27:44.520 --> 27:48.560]  the month Gates condemned European defense cuts and said the US is tired
[27:48.560 --> 27:52.840]  of engaging in combat missions for those who don't want to share the risks and
[27:52.840 --> 27:57.760]  costs even Robert Gates who won't back this new war is really telling the
[27:57.760 --> 28:03.120]  European allies that they need to step it up there's been reports that NATO has
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.800]  already been running out of ammunition and of course the speech was given
[28:07.800 --> 28:13.180]  elsewhere in Europe but we did have inside Intel telling us that Robert
[28:13.180 --> 28:16.680]  Gates was among those attending the Bilderberg conference not on the
[28:16.680 --> 28:21.680]  official members list in violation of the Logan Act that prevents US officials
[28:21.680 --> 28:25.840]  from meeting behind closed doors with foreign officials without the knowledge
[28:25.840 --> 28:31.000]  of Congress and yet here he is meeting not directly inside the subreddit hotel
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.200]  in San Maritz but with a lot of the important Bilderberg members in Europe
[28:35.200 --> 28:40.040]  and really giving them one of those coded messages for the inner elite not
[28:40.040 --> 28:45.520]  really generally for public consumption and then by the same token we have
[28:45.520 --> 28:51.920]  really alarming points here as Leon Panetta is about to come in from CIA
[28:51.920 --> 28:58.080]  director into Secretary of Defense position as they heat up Libya as Syria
[28:58.080 --> 29:03.040]  looks like it's probably the next hot area there in the Middle East this
[29:03.040 --> 29:07.720]  article by John Galt from yesterday living in the shadows a world of black ops
[29:07.720 --> 29:14.160]  and cyber wars all about how Leon Panetta the exiting CIA director openly
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.000]  admitted that shadow wars and black ops should be a strategy basically more
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.120]  often imposed but that is something we're gonna get more into on the other
[29:25.120 --> 29:29.800]  side Paul Joseph Watson's gonna join me and coming up we're gonna get into some
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.320]  of the behind-the-scenes stories from Bilderberg and more importantly we're
[29:34.320 --> 29:38.680]  gonna show how their agenda as nexus with this Arab Spring and the looming

[33:20.160 --> 33:31.640]  we're back again on this Friday June 17th things are unfortunately just
[33:31.640 --> 33:37.120]  heating up for World War three I've just begun to try to slip into the
[33:37.120 --> 33:43.600]  destabilization campaign aimed for the Mideast region as the powers that be
[33:43.600 --> 33:47.720]  look like they're attempting to draw China and Russia into the conflict
[33:47.720 --> 33:53.120]  obviously they've had their eyes on Iran for years and years Syria may now be
[33:53.120 --> 34:00.760]  drawn into conflict it's I wish I was more articulate because this is really
[34:00.760 --> 34:05.520]  the day before the the big crisis so what was it like before World War one
[34:05.520 --> 34:13.240]  and World War two which they provocateur it also just untold death and untold
[34:13.240 --> 34:18.040]  harm I really hope this doesn't happen again but they probably actually don't
[34:18.040 --> 34:21.960]  want a World War three that looks like a hot World War three with the big label
[34:21.960 --> 34:27.080]  they've always been pitching these wars on the humanitarian crisis so much of
[34:27.080 --> 34:31.640]  the Arab Spring that we've been tracking for months and months now really has
[34:31.640 --> 34:37.320]  been under the guise of open democracy of breaking through these dictator regimes
[34:37.320 --> 34:41.400]  and sure there's a lot of bad regimes in the Middle East but I don't think our
[34:41.400 --> 34:45.600]  sabotage here in the United States is really gonna help matters just one of
[34:45.600 --> 34:49.440]  those articles the New York Times from April 14th U.S. groups helped nurture
[34:49.440 --> 34:56.960]  Arab uprisings and I really think it gets back to an article from 2007 we have
[34:56.960 --> 35:02.280]  Paul Watson joining me in just a moment but remember Revolution flash mobs and
[35:02.280 --> 35:08.560]  brain ships a grim vision of the future you know it ostensibly on the surface
[35:08.560 --> 35:14.200]  was something aimed for 2035 but why wait why not just craft the revolution
[35:14.200 --> 35:19.120]  make it seem like hi-tech online groups the Twitter revolution the Facebook
[35:19.120 --> 35:23.160]  revolutions why not make it seem like that's where it's all coming from when
[35:23.160 --> 35:27.600]  it's really U.S. backed it's just interesting coming from Bilderberg this
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.680]  week how many of the hi-tech moguls were meeting inside of Bilderberg and how
[35:32.680 --> 35:40.720]  many of them had and very important roles in the media mid-east crises one of
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.320]  them is Google's Eric Schmidt he was there at Bilderberg this year and one of
[35:45.320 --> 35:49.280]  his executives basically started the protest in Egypt he said he was very
[35:49.280 --> 35:56.360]  proud of them let's go down to Paul Watson do we have him hi Paul thanks for
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.560]  joining me I was great to see you in Samurit Switzerland what do you see
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.160]  happening as World War three looms how much of this came through the
[36:04.160 --> 36:10.080]  Bilderberg agenda Paul good to be on the air Aaron yeah basically one of the
[36:10.080 --> 36:13.920]  first things that came out of the Bilderberg conference through Jim Tucker
[36:13.920 --> 36:18.680]  sources was this fact that the globalists were petrified at the building
[36:18.680 --> 36:24.520]  resistance within Congress to the expansion the intensification of this
[36:24.520 --> 36:29.880]  bombardment of Libya and of course days later we got this information out of
[36:29.880 --> 36:35.000]  Fort Hood saying that the full-scale ground invasion is basically set for
[36:35.000 --> 36:41.440]  October yesterday you had Kusinich and Ron Paul file this federal lawsuit which
[36:41.440 --> 36:47.400]  goes after Obama for violating the War Powers Act so again in both these
[36:47.400 --> 36:53.360]  instances this leaked information that Bilderberg were planning to intensify
[36:53.360 --> 36:57.680]  this war in the Middle Eastern North Africa he's already come into fruition
[36:57.680 --> 37:02.240]  within days of the Bilderberg conference ending so it proves once again
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.480]  that these power brokers don't get together to you know merely pet play
[37:07.480 --> 37:12.280]  tiddlywinks as many of the mainstream media will have us believe but the
[37:12.280 --> 37:18.600]  fact that Libya is merely one outpost of this Middle Eastern war that the
[37:18.600 --> 37:24.800]  globalists want to inflame the entire region is proven by the fact that what
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.920]  you were just talking about now they're talking about Syria of course we had
[37:28.920 --> 37:32.880]  information come out right at the end of the Bilderberg conference at the tail
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.280]  end of the summit that Bilderberg would make its agenda on Syria known in the
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.720]  coming days and weeks and that's precisely what we saw happen on Tuesday
[37:43.720 --> 37:51.440]  we had reports that the USS Baton amphibia air carrier strike vessel 2000
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.360]  Marines six warplanes 15 attack helicopters was being moved to a
[37:56.360 --> 38:02.840]  location just off the Syrian coast in preparation for another humanitarian
[38:02.840 --> 38:08.760]  military intervention under the justification of helping the protesters
[38:08.760 --> 38:14.080]  up to a thousand apparently have been killed by police about 300 police and
[38:14.080 --> 38:19.680]  military have been killed in the conflict so now we're including Syria
[38:19.680 --> 38:24.800]  into the equation of course similar brutalities occurring in both Bahrain
[38:24.800 --> 38:30.000]  and Saudi Arabia but because those guys are in the the New World Order Club we're
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  not hearing about any kind of humanitarian intervention there for the
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.720]  time being top it's war is peaceful but I just want to of course I want to stick
[38:39.720 --> 38:44.000]  with the geopolitics but I just want to point out this isn't my first Bilderberg
[38:44.000 --> 38:48.760]  meeting to observe and I've learned that the agenda they say you're gonna see
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.040]  leaks of it in the days immediately following the agenda and we've seen that
[38:53.040 --> 38:56.680]  with Libya we've seen that with Syria and we've especially seen that with the
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.000]  cyber agenda and the false flag cyber attack they look like they're setting up
[39:01.000 --> 39:07.280]  Paul well yeah you've got more hack attacks on the world bank the CIA and
[39:07.280 --> 39:14.400]  isn't it interesting that the fight that we got over 3 million views on just in
[39:14.400 --> 39:20.040]  TV with our live coverage of Bilderberg using an iPhone 4 streaming live video
[39:20.040 --> 39:25.600]  and then just days after the event you know which all these tech moguls are
[39:25.600 --> 39:29.800]  attending they come out with this new Apple patent which says that they're
[39:29.800 --> 39:36.080]  gonna block via infrared sensors people filming live events now initially
[39:36.080 --> 39:40.800]  that's going to be concerts also if you read the patent it says museums are
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.040]  going to block it and embed their own watermark on it but this is another tool
[39:45.040 --> 39:48.840]  with which to strangle the alternative media this is going to be used to block
[39:48.840 --> 39:53.840]  police confrontations it's going to be used to block people filming protests
[39:53.840 --> 39:58.960]  and political events so all manner of subjects that Bilderberg were talking
[39:58.960 --> 40:02.400]  about and that they were looking to pursue and push through come out in the
[40:02.400 --> 40:06.280]  days does it take weeks does it take months in the very days after the
[40:06.280 --> 40:11.920]  conference once again debunking the myth that they have no influence over
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.600]  world events well give me a break Paul it not only is that they want to cut down
[40:16.600 --> 40:21.240]  on protesters being able to cover the events but they also want to pursue this
[40:21.240 --> 40:26.400]  antitrust law agenda they got very important people from both the US and
[40:26.400 --> 40:31.320]  the EU Commission on this this year's member list I can get to in a minute
[40:31.320 --> 40:36.400]  they not only want to be able to block what the US can do but they
[40:36.400 --> 40:42.480]  simultaneously contradictively hippo hippo critically want to quote bank row
[40:42.480 --> 40:47.960]  bankroll shadow internet for dissidents abroad I've got this out of the AFP from
[40:47.960 --> 40:51.760]  June 12th only a few days ago during the conference the government is
[40:51.760 --> 40:56.080]  financing the development of shadow internet systems to enable dissidents
[40:56.080 --> 41:00.880]  abroad to get around government sensors so they're going to enable these
[41:00.880 --> 41:04.240]  people in the dictator countries while they climb down and make our own
[41:04.240 --> 41:09.800]  countries greater dictatorships full well that's right of course it all comes
[41:09.800 --> 41:14.920]  from this Cass Sunstein cognitive infiltration document which was pow by
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.760]  the Harvard professor Sunstein a year before Obama came to office now of
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.920]  course he's Obama's informations are and it's all about infiltrating shutting
[41:24.920 --> 41:30.520]  down quote conspiracy theories which of course is anything that differs from the
[41:30.520 --> 41:34.840]  official version of events so that's where it all stems from even in the
[41:34.840 --> 41:41.360]  Bush era in 2006 they said that the new war was against quote conspiracy
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.320]  theories on the internet so this isn't a recent thing this stretches back at
[41:45.320 --> 41:51.040]  least five or six years that they plan to use the internet against us firstly
[41:51.040 --> 41:55.040]  to ferret us out and find out who the quote extremists are and then to shut
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.080]  down our free speech altogether so that was again in evidence at Bilderberg
[41:59.080 --> 42:05.760]  with Microsoft Facebook Google all of them in attendance to discuss this yeah
[42:05.760 --> 42:10.840]  and in fact the official Bilderberg meetings.org website leaked a very
[42:10.840 --> 42:15.000]  small agenda we can only sort of read between the lines and match it up with
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.880]  the more detailed agenda that came out from moles and leaks inside but let me
[42:19.880 --> 42:23.920]  just read those topics challenges for growth innovation and budgetary
[42:23.920 --> 42:28.360]  discipline the euro and challenges for the European Union obviously we know
[42:28.360 --> 42:32.280]  they're very concerned about the fall of Greece and what's going to mean for the
[42:32.280 --> 42:37.280]  rest of the European Union the role of emerging economies conflict areas if
[42:37.280 --> 42:41.920]  that isn't a euphemism they just simply say conflict areas as nearly the whole
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.800]  region falls into flames Paul they also have demographic challenges about the
[42:47.800 --> 42:52.280]  growing Mideast population and the declining Western populations
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.760]  demographically speaking China is on the list with no detail at all Paul are
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.240]  they looking at war or peace or just simply the treasury bond issues they're
[43:02.240 --> 43:06.440]  also concerned about Switzerland can it remain successful in the future we talked
[43:06.440 --> 43:10.320]  a lot about that but they're very angry still that Switzerland remains neutral
[43:10.320 --> 43:15.320]  and sovereign and refuses to adopt their euro and European Union even as that
[43:15.320 --> 43:21.840]  begins to fall Paul and they've really just declared an unsafe haven for sovereign
[43:21.840 --> 43:25.400]  countries in the 21st century so of course they want Switzerland but they
[43:25.400 --> 43:29.920]  also talked about new challenges in the Middle East as well as social networks
[43:29.920 --> 43:35.080]  connectivity and security issues just everything shows they're gearing towards
[43:35.080 --> 43:39.720]  this and they've been covering that agenda for years now Paul last year in
[43:39.720 --> 43:45.800]  Spain to June 2010 they had a topic called social networking from the
[43:45.800 --> 43:50.720]  Obama campaign to the Iranian Revolution and if that doesn't underscore
[43:50.720 --> 43:53.800]  quite a bit of everything that's happening in the Middle East I don't know
[43:53.800 --> 43:58.200]  what does they've been concerned also for years about the growing influence of
[43:58.200 --> 44:03.000]  cyber technology and they've had on people not only like Bill Gates and the
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.760]  Facebook founder but Craig J. Moondi of Microsoft they've got a managing partner
[44:08.760 --> 44:14.440]  of the Founders Fund they've got Eric Schmidt of Google Peter Thiel who's on
[44:14.440 --> 44:19.200]  the Bilderberg steering committee and is also the PayPal executive and really
[44:19.200 --> 44:23.920]  intimately involved with Facebook to boot as well as a nanotech and future
[44:23.920 --> 44:29.520]  stuff but then they also have Christine Varney assistant attorney general for
[44:29.520 --> 44:34.040]  anti-trust Paul so you can see where they're clamping down on camera use in
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.920]  the US because of supposed copyright issues you might be at a concert trying
[44:38.920 --> 44:44.160]  to bootleg copyrighted music but at the same time they're covertly sponsoring
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.520]  revolutionary groups using these new media as Paul I we've kind of covered
[44:49.520 --> 44:55.000]  that but it's important well yeah and also we had the presence of Peter
[44:55.000 --> 45:01.880]  Mandelson who it was of course behind the Digital Economy Act of 2010 in the
[45:01.880 --> 45:06.200]  UK which was very similar to some of the cyber security laws that they're now
[45:06.200 --> 45:11.320]  pushing through in the US which is about basically declaring everything as
[45:11.320 --> 45:16.360]  copyright and pursuing people going after people on the flimsiest of pretext
[45:16.360 --> 45:21.640]  for this copyright violation of course now YouTube says that if they get a
[45:21.640 --> 45:25.840]  request from the government they don't investigate it they get a request to
[45:25.840 --> 45:30.400]  remove content they immediately remove it and that's what happened in Britain
[45:30.400 --> 45:35.560]  with the recent protest of the council tax with the whole Freeman issue up there
[45:35.560 --> 45:39.240]  in Birkenhead and it's the same in the United States YouTube is now removing
[45:39.240 --> 45:44.000]  content not even for copyright just by a government request so you had
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.840]  Mandelson there who was this big player behind censorship of the Internet and
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.080]  the United Kingdom last year also attending Bilderberg but you also
[45:53.080 --> 45:57.280]  mentioned the European Union which of course was a topic of discussion at
[45:57.280 --> 46:03.480]  last year's meeting in in Spain and again in the very days after this year's
[46:03.480 --> 46:08.640]  conference it's become very apparent that Bilderberg's goal to prevent the
[46:08.640 --> 46:14.280]  breakup of the European Union is very much failing it's on the ropes because
[46:14.280 --> 46:20.640]  this Greek debt situation is just going to drag on and on and it exposes the
[46:20.640 --> 46:25.280]  fact that this system of regional currency blocks which is ultimately planned
[46:25.280 --> 46:30.640]  to become the global currency is only ever as strong as its weakest member and
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.600]  in fact you had Bilderberg as writing in the Financial Times beforehand and after
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.720]  that if they don't rescue this Greek debt situation if Greece defaults on its
[46:40.720 --> 46:46.600]  debt it could spend spell the end for the euro and eventually the plan for a
[46:46.600 --> 46:51.440]  global currency with the EU member states returning to their own nominal
[46:51.440 --> 46:56.720]  national currencies but according to the information leaked from inside this
[46:56.720 --> 47:01.680]  year's Bilderberg group conference the globalists are going to try to make
[47:01.680 --> 47:06.360]  lemonade out of lemons by pushing through what is being called quote a
[47:06.360 --> 47:12.480]  massive power grab that would give the EU itself the authority to punish
[47:12.480 --> 47:17.480]  countries that don't follow its strict economic mandate so they want to create
[47:17.480 --> 47:23.560]  this EU Ministry of Finance to prevent another Greece situation from threatening
[47:23.560 --> 47:28.400]  the cherished stability of their eurozone so we're basically talking
[47:28.400 --> 47:34.320]  about a central economic government with economic with executive powers that
[47:34.320 --> 47:39.360]  would cover the whole of Europe any economic sovereignty of individual
[47:39.360 --> 47:43.720]  member states would be crushed it would cease to exist so our tax money as
[47:43.720 --> 47:48.720]  Europeans would go directly to this centralized planning committee who would
[47:48.720 --> 47:53.680]  then decide how to spend it which is no surprise given the fact that the
[47:53.680 --> 47:59.600]  president of the EU Herman van Rompuy who was there in San Maritz last week was
[47:59.600 --> 48:04.080]  picked for that very position by Bilderberg after a Bilderberg dinner in
[48:04.080 --> 48:10.920]  2009 one of these offshoot groups because he advocated an EU centralized tax
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.920]  that we would all pay an additional tax to fund the EU so they want to exploit
[48:16.920 --> 48:20.840]  this Greece situation they not only want to rescue it but they want to exploit it
[48:20.840 --> 48:26.160]  to create this centralized economic dictatorship which would directly tax
[48:26.160 --> 48:33.880]  all EU citizens to fund the B system the European Union itself Wow I it's
[48:33.880 --> 48:39.120]  really one of those situations of global solution out of the global crisis
[48:39.120 --> 48:42.720]  they started the whole thing they were ahead of most of the banks that got
[48:42.720 --> 48:47.560]  bailed out especially in Europe and they've really set it in motion so that
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.240]  Greek was forced to confront this debt situation we have Papa Andrew
[48:52.240 --> 48:57.440]  reconfiguring the Greek government this week and preparing to step down he's a
[48:57.440 --> 49:02.480]  Bilderberger so are a lot of the main financial ministers and we have
[49:02.480 --> 49:08.440]  Edna Devignon writing in 2009 really kind of acknowledging tacitly how they
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.920]  started or set in motion or let fall this economic crisis but that it was a
[49:13.920 --> 49:18.400]  little bit out of control even after one year the austerity protest alone
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.760]  threatening their ability to consolidate on the exact kind of global and
[49:23.760 --> 49:28.520]  European based centralized solution that you were just describing Paul can
[49:28.520 --> 49:35.560]  you go in more into that yeah basically the whole European economic system
[49:35.560 --> 49:41.760]  emerged out of the steel and coal system post-World War two and in the
[49:41.760 --> 49:47.560]  1955 Bilderberg archives you can see where individual members advocate not
[49:47.560 --> 49:52.240]  only a European economic community which eventually became the European Union
[49:52.240 --> 49:58.080]  after the Treaty of Rome in 57 but also a single currency the euro and this was
[49:58.080 --> 50:04.320]  over 50 years before it actually came into being so it's their baby it's their
[50:04.320 --> 50:08.400]  brainchild that's why they're so desperate to rescue it last year in
[50:08.400 --> 50:11.920]  Spain they said we need to save the euro it's going downhill and that was at a
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.720]  time when it was around 119 to the dollar they managed to prop it back up
[50:16.720 --> 50:20.200]  back up against the point of you know 140 against the dollar which is where it
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.440]  is now but this grease debt situation is still rolling on you had an emergency
[50:25.440 --> 50:31.240]  meeting last month with the finance ministers there the Spiegel reported on
[50:31.240 --> 50:36.000]  it at the time so they're petrified that we're going out to break but we're
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.280]  going to get right back into the stuff on the other side and even more detail
[50:40.280 --> 50:44.640]  into how they're managing the geopolitical crisis the euro crisis and
[50:44.640 --> 50:50.720]  the larger financial situation or simply greater global control I'm Aaron Dyke

[50:59.840 --> 51:04.280]  phase one of the insiders plan for a one-world government has been initiated
[51:04.280 --> 51:07.800]  with a recent bailout international bankers and power brokers have
[51:07.800 --> 51:12.040]  engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.920]  act as saviour but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis
[51:15.920 --> 51:19.840]  will be on a scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty
[51:19.840 --> 51:23.360]  shelves will spread fear and panic across the land the insiders have
[51:23.360 --> 51:27.600]  discovered that they must control two things to seize total power phase one
[51:27.600 --> 51:31.080]  is a one-world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept

[52:22.200 --> 52:25.680]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[52:25.680 --> 52:29.440]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four

[54:22.480 --> 54:27.480]  still Aaron Dyke sitting in and we still have Paul Joseph Watson other people
[54:27.480 --> 54:31.560]  are also coming up in the broadcast we've got some of the eyewitnesses to the
[54:31.560 --> 54:36.760]  2011 St. Moritz Bilderberg meeting some of the stories and things we saw there
[54:36.760 --> 54:41.720]  different encounters each year there's always a new kind of mini setup being
[54:41.720 --> 54:46.440]  chased by police or some kind of mini harassment going on there was plenty of
[54:46.440 --> 54:51.640]  that going around in 2011 we'll get into some of that of course among the things
[54:51.640 --> 54:56.480]  fresh in the news today Greek debt crisis billions more will be pumped in to
[54:56.480 --> 55:00.560]  rescue Greece obviously they're concerned about that what that will mean for
[55:00.560 --> 55:04.600]  the euro also coming up later in the broadcast I believe we're gonna have a
[55:04.600 --> 55:10.080]  few of the minutes of Alex Jones' speech for Talkers magazine guess who's
[55:10.080 --> 55:15.440]  coming to keynote Alex gave that speech last Saturday over the weekend while we
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.240]  were in Samer at Switzerland and we're gonna find out what he had to say about
[55:19.240 --> 55:22.760]  the growth of alternative media which obviously the Bilderberg group among
[55:22.760 --> 55:27.040]  others are concerned about a citizen activists take to the streets everywhere
[55:27.040 --> 55:34.840]  as people in Europe say no to austerity measures and so much more Paul Joseph
[55:34.840 --> 55:39.720]  Watson's article today globals want permanent occupation of Iraq just more
[55:39.720 --> 55:45.040]  dreadful deadly news for the World War 3 scenario that's still unfolding with
[55:45.040 --> 55:50.880]  three and four wars underway and hitting that number five with Libya as well as
[55:50.880 --> 55:56.760]  the bombings in Yemen Obama and the powers that be have not said let's end
[55:56.760 --> 56:01.440]  the war in Iraq as he insinuated and promised during the campaign but instead
[56:01.440 --> 56:06.040]  they want a permanent occupation of Iraq we already knew that five six seven
[56:06.040 --> 56:10.880]  eight nine years ago maybe I'm too far up in the years but Paul Joseph Watson
[56:10.880 --> 56:15.040]  break down this article and break down what they're really doing with the
[56:15.040 --> 56:20.120]  destabilization campaigns in the Middle East please well obviously Obama
[56:20.120 --> 56:25.400]  campaigned on the promise to withdraw all US troops from Iraq immediately we
[56:25.400 --> 56:30.680]  had this fake withdrawal last year in August where thousands of private
[56:30.680 --> 56:37.080]  security were left behind and in fact 46,000 US combat troops were left in
[56:37.080 --> 56:42.640]  Iraq so we've had the date for withdrawal pushed back every single year
[56:42.640 --> 56:47.760]  since George W. Bush declared mission accomplished in May 2003 and now
[56:47.760 --> 56:52.560]  according to the chatter coming out of the Bilderberg conference last week
[56:52.560 --> 56:58.520]  they're talking about exercising some form of squatters rights in order to keep
[56:58.520 --> 57:03.520]  these US troops in the country of course there are numerous US military bases
[57:03.520 --> 57:07.360]  they need to be staffed this is going to be a launch pad for the wars against
[57:07.360 --> 57:13.800]  Libya Syria Iran and everyone else in the region so according to these leaked
[57:13.800 --> 57:20.560]  chatter from the moles inside the Bilderberg group the quote was that the
[57:20.560 --> 57:27.000]  US had no intention of ever leaving Iraq that the occupation would be permanent
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.320]  one European delegate commented that quote it is anyone's guess when US
[57:32.320 --> 57:39.040]  troops will finally be withdrawn suggesting that this December 31st 2011
[57:39.040 --> 57:44.400]  deadline is complete baloney just like the last one was and in fact another US
[57:44.400 --> 57:50.440]  Bilderberger said quote when you think of Iraq think big so again the troops are
[57:50.440 --> 57:55.200]  going nowhere they're going to use Iraq as a launching pad for a new war against
[57:55.200 --> 57:59.960]  Syria Libya and everyone else and it's basically you know more of the same
[57:59.960 --> 58:04.720]  Obama campaign on getting troops out more troops are deployed more US troops
[58:04.720 --> 58:09.800]  all over the world under Obama compared to George W. Bush and Bilderberg have had
[58:09.800 --> 58:14.640]  a direct hand in what happens in Iraq right from 2002 as Jim Tucker report
[58:14.640 --> 58:17.560]  when they delayed the start all right Paul this is the short break we're going
[58:17.560 --> 58:21.800]  to be back just on the other side and there's a lot more to cover obviously so
[58:21.800 --> 58:26.680]  info wars.com stay tuned in the second hour coming up in just about a minute
[58:26.680 --> 58:50.840]  here this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is
[58:50.840 --> 58:54.200]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[58:54.200 --> 58:58.120]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[58:58.120 --> 59:02.360]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[59:02.360 --> 59:06.640]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[59:06.640 --> 59:11.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.080]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[59:15.080 --> 59:19.640]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.640 --> 59:23.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.760 --> 59:27.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.760 --> 59:31.560]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.560 --> 59:34.280]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.280 --> 59:40.280]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.280 --> 59:44.960]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to

[59:56.240 --> 1:00:00.760]  Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:04.520 --> 1:00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:23.400]  Alex Jones
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:35.480]  we are back again live this Friday June 17th I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in while
[1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:40.680]  Alex is away we're now into the second hour we've been with Paul Joseph Watson
[1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:45.400]  coming up of course is Bob Chapman economic expert and total guru he's
[1:00:45.400 --> 1:00:49.640]  gonna have a lot of insight I'm sure on everything going on in Greece and what
[1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:54.720]  it means for Spain Portugal Ireland and the United States what day will the US
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:59.720]  get its first IMF loan we also want to give out the phone number we want to
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:04.640]  get your take it is open phones but at the same time with World War 3 looming
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:09.920]  with the European crisis really in the balance right now I'd really like to
[1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:14.160]  hear something relevant from you other than just ancient history but the number
[1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:22.680]  is 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 we're going to get to your calls in a few
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:26.640]  minutes and throughout the rest of the broadcast we're also going to talk to
[1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:32.960]  Bilderberg insider Alex Pinesch outsider actually witness to the events
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:37.720]  along with us in St. Merritt Switzerland witness also to some of the being
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:42.160]  chased by police on the mountains and the other adventures in high parts of
[1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:47.080]  the world but Paul Joseph Watson just to bring us back into discussion I'm
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:53.560]  looking at a document from 2008 October 30th 2008 Rand Corporation lobbies
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:59.400]  Pentagon start a war to save the US economy back in 2008 they discussed
[1:01:59.400 --> 1:02:04.680]  bringing up a World War 3 scenario that could even involve China Russia or even
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:10.720]  Japan simply to bolster the US economy what do you think about that Paul well
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:14.280]  that's interesting because it came straight out of Chinese state media
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:18.160]  which is basically the voice of the government so they were blowing the
[1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:22.080]  whistle on the fact that Rand were getting together with the Pentagon to
[1:02:22.080 --> 1:02:28.120]  try and foment this new war to distract people from the economic crisis what
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:31.840]  came out of Bilderberg was the fact that they want this massive war in the
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:36.800]  Middle East which includes everybody apart from Israel I mean but the the scope
[1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:41.960]  of what this can be obviously hinges on China's reaction because for the first
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:48.280]  time ever at Bilderberg we had two Chinese officials in attendance so the
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:53.320]  debate centers around whether China is going to become this new empire that
[1:02:53.320 --> 1:02:57.560]  will compete with the globalist with the New World Order or whether it will be
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:02.600]  absorbed into the New World Order Club and specifically in the Middle East
[1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:08.560]  China are furious that the United States is involved in this Libya intervention
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:13.080]  because over the past five ten years China has basically set about
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:18.840]  colonizing Africa financially and for its resources and the Africans have been
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:22.200]  willing to go along with it because China doesn't have the history of
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:26.420]  exploiting the country for its own benefit as the West does as America
[1:03:26.420 --> 1:03:31.960]  does as the British Empire does the French Empire the NATO powers so in
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:36.400]  addition to this we've got obviously China set to become the largest economy
[1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:41.800]  in the world in 2016 so obviously the globalist the Bilderberg crowd are
[1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:47.120]  trying to extend an olive branch to China by integrating them into the club
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:52.800]  and it's obviously an effort to weaken the alliance with Pakistan the China the
[1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:56.800]  Chinese and Pakistan economies are basically basically becoming
[1:03:56.800 --> 1:04:01.680]  vertically integrated that alliance is now so strong as a result of Pakistan
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:07.960]  turning away from the United States after the bin Laden facade so we know
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:12.960]  that you know the drone strikes are intensifying against Pakistan and the
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:17.720]  globalist don't want to have to deal with this wild card of China as they're
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:23.680]  trying to get rid of Pakistan and destroy Pakistan sovereignty basically so
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.040]  it's about bringing China into the fold and ensuring that they don't make any
[1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:35.800]  unpredictable moves regarding Pakistan as this PNAC global takeover ensues it
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:39.760]  is unfortunately possibly a confrontation looming as we've seen
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:44.760]  african moving in as a greater imperial force in Africa then we've seen
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:49.200]  tensions breaking down with Pakistan as China builds those bases we had Dr.
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:53.680]  Hamid Ghul on yesterday we'll be back on the other side of the break info wars

[1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:14.760]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in this
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:19.840]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:07:19.840 --> 1:07:25.160]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:30.080]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:34.480]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:38.200]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:42.160]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:47.720]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:53.840]  the Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're
[1:07:53.840 --> 1:08:01.240]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV Genesis
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:06.400]  communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:23.400]  there's a war on for your mind
[1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:29.480]  we are back once again on the Alex Jones show Aaron Dyke sitting in while Alex is
[1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:34.360]  away but what a day to be gone of course World War three really seems to be
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:39.920]  alluming the Euro crisis in full scope and just on the heels of the
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:43.200]  Bilderberg meetings where we've seen many of the reported leaked inside
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:50.480]  agenda already playing out whether it be over the cyber security act whether it
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:56.200]  be over greater war in Libya whether it be trying to rebuff US politicians who
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:01.000]  want to end some of those wars or whether it be the euro situation between
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.760]  Greece and the still sovereign countries like Switzerland Paul Watson we
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:10.280]  want to go down to a few calls and get their take but real quick what are we
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:16.520]  looking at we were discussing China and the geo strategic situation yeah in
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:20.360]  conclusion they're basically trying to hand out an olive branch to China because
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:26.320]  they're scared stiff of how the Chinese will react when this big Middle East war
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:31.120]  kicks off obviously they're already planning to go into Libya in October as
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:37.160]  our source has told us but it's when Pakistan becomes involved that they're
[1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:43.080]  decidedly unsure about how the Chinese will react so that is the touch point
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:49.320]  when it's gonna kick off big time and that is the threat of World War 3 Paul
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:53.040]  let's see what the callers have to add I think we have on the line Hector from
[1:09:53.040 --> 1:09:58.920]  California are you there Hector yeah I'm here and I just wanted to start off the
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:05.000]  two two points I wanted to make but first off it boggles my mind that there's so
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:08.240]  much news going on and it's even in mainstream now you know everything that's
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:13.040]  going on in the world and Americans I mean I talked to a lot of people every
[1:10:13.040 --> 1:10:18.160]  day and I would say 99% of people still just live in blissful ignorance and you
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:21.680]  can tell them fact after fact after fact and let them decide from themselves and
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:26.360]  they still they they still will not when they refuse to wake up and we're on the
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:30.520]  verge of you know World War 3 and everyone that I know you know young
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:34.320]  people old people they came more about celebrity gossip and more about you know
[1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:39.120]  what's going on on MTV than they do about these real issues that are you know
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:44.160]  pushing us to the brink of you know a thermal nuclear war for example I mean
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:47.600]  just the state of not only the the economy but you know the world economy
[1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:50.560]  I mean we are in a depression like Alex Jones and everyone says we are in a
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:56.000]  depression and one example I give people is in the 30s you know there was
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:11:00.040]  bread lines there was soup kitchens and the only reason that we don't see those
[1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:04.960]  today is because of food stamps and because of ebt cards get rid of those
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:11.960]  and it's the same as it is in the 30s if in a lot of senses it's worse and you
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:16.200]  know it's gonna it's gonna take a lot of really bad times for people to really
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:20.960]  wake up and by then it might be too late second question point I wanted to raise
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:25.440]  is a for a long time I woke up about two years ago and for a long time I was
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:29.960]  just in complete denial about a lot of these things and namely subliminal
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:36.120]  messaging since I woke up I started to see it more and more and more and this
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:41.400]  was some new movies that came out I had to sit down on a new X-Men movie and
[1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:46.320]  there's actually a point in the movie where they specifically say that it's
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:51.400]  necessary to strip people of their rights in order to obtain security which
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:56.400]  is a complete you know assault on on what Ben Franklin said and it just it
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.680]  boggles my mind that people just continue to eat it up and and you know we
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:04.320]  are winning we are waking more people up but more of us need to wake up if you
[1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:08.040]  know we ever want to bring about real change and and steal the power from you
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:11.360]  know the elitists that are running a world you know yeah unfortunately you
[1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:15.600]  really have a point Hector a lot of these movies are basically theater for
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:20.000]  the mind for the general public who as you say are completely out of the realm
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:24.800]  of of real stuff going on and further I think there's kind of an animal
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:30.400]  psychology limit to our attention spans I've seen it explain how a lion in a
[1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:34.920]  cage at a circus that they use a chair and a whip because that's more points
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:38.400]  than he can keep track of so that he's not thinking about quote the man in the
[1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:42.880]  white pants I think it's a lot the same with the war they've got his focus a on
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:48.240]  celebrity issues be on getting food on the table or on on fulfilling the
[1:12:48.240 --> 1:12:53.040]  obligations for food stamps etc and then who could keep track of five wars who
[1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:57.560]  can even name them all Webster Tarpaulin Alex Jones could barely name all the
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:01.800]  different conflicts going on as they still unfold Paul Watson what do you
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:06.760]  have to say about that well it's amazing isn't it that in a week where the
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:10.800]  eurozone is on the verge of collapse we've got all these new wars kicking off
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:17.760]  the biggest story on Fox News and CNN is still for the what third week running
[1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:24.000]  Weena's Weena just gives you an insight into how these networks control the
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:28.720]  paradigm but I mean the caller was talking about 90 odd percent of people
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:34.320]  who are not awake I mean if you're not awake by now at least tangentially to
[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:39.160]  these issues and really there's no hope is there but I think one of the biggest
[1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:43.800]  stumbling blocks that we come across regularly is the people that are aware
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:48.880]  but just don't do anything about it that the keyboard warriors they just sit
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:53.360]  behind their cynically complaining about you know protesting is not going to do
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:57.720]  anything this is not going to do anything even as the Bilderberg agenda
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:02.000]  starts to fail the things that they're calling for start to fail so we're
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.840]  having an impact these people still sit there just cynically whining that we
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:11.520]  can't do anything so even more over than the people who just are completely
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:16.560]  unaware and distracted I think it's the people who are aware but just choose to
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:21.040]  think that they have no influence or power whatsoever that's our biggest
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:24.840]  problem going forward so those are the people we need to target the people who
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:29.240]  were already in the arena but I just sat up in the bleachers doing nothing
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:33.440]  about it yeah we can't make any difference that's why they're trying to
[1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:37.720]  shut down our cameras and why the police at Bilderberg tried to shut down the
[1:14:37.720 --> 1:14:41.840]  protesters and take their passports and intimidate them but that all changed
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:45.280]  didn't it Paul when a member of the Swiss Parliament wrote a letter telling
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.840]  police that they weren't allowed to do that anymore
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:51.560]  oh yeah and in the first day that we're really aggressive I mean they were
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:56.280]  seizing people's passports as the conference went on they pulled back
[1:14:56.280 --> 1:15:00.400]  further and further and we were able to get more in the faces of Bilderberg
[1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:03.800]  members to the point where we were basically just chasing them around in
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:09.440]  there in their limos and so forth but again I mean most of the people you
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:14.000]  read our website are not actively involved I mean we have to face up to
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:17.600]  that fact so we have to target those people and try and get the message through
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.360]  that you can have an impact it's already manifesting itself in the days
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:27.880]  after with the opposition to the Libya war intensifying as Bilderberg feared
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:33.080]  and their whole Eurozone EU project collapsing around their feet so the
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:37.000]  focus on what they're doing does have an effect it does have an influence we're
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:40.600]  not saying we're going to save the world overnight but you at least have to have
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:45.320]  the belief that you can have an influence to have any impact on the
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:50.240]  situation at all so it's just about you know having self-confidence not being a
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:54.280]  keyboard warrior who just cynically attacks other people and actually just
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:59.200]  getting out there and doing something and it's many hands make light work and
[1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:02.720]  obviously the protesters in Europe right now are making a difference on that
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:09.960]  point let's go down to Kevin in Ohio are you there Kevin hello amen to everything
[1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:13.440]  you're saying I want to bring to attention and I really hope that Alex
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:18.600]  and this broadcast can can bring it to light there's a country a European
[1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:24.080]  country that is trying to break the shackles of tyranny all the way back
[1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:30.000]  from early in the in the 20th century it's a long forgotten country it's
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:35.520]  Belarus in the last month they've devalued their currency by over 50%
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:43.200]  Lukashenko still runs with an iron fist imprisoning all his opponents and I
[1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:48.000]  would like to hear an outcry for these people to break this tyranny there's
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:55.280]  been just just gobbling them up World War two World War one and I would like
[1:16:55.280 --> 1:17:00.680]  this program to have an effect for them somebody to shout out to them because
[1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:07.120]  they don't hear from anyone that country just continues to be run over and Mr.
[1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:13.480]  Watts is right we don't do anything I'm a non-vet and where are the Vietnam
[1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:19.400]  veterans against the war we should be all be down down there with everyone just
[1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:25.480]  protesting every day no more wars no more blood of our people for them for
[1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:33.040]  the banks no more God bless you both bless you also you know we've seen quite
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:36.360]  a bit of protesting during the Bush years and then suddenly it evaporated in
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:41.360]  the Obama years as if the wars were suddenly attractive and desirable but
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:45.640]  as far as Belarus I know there's been what looks to be staged terror attacks
[1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:50.440]  over there things have been obviously very difficult in Eastern Europe that
[1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:53.840]  doesn't mean I'm an expert on the situation Paul Watson what do you know
[1:17:53.840 --> 1:18:01.480]  about Belarus well you obviously had Lukashenko coming out and opposing the
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:06.480]  new world order basically a few months ago they're similarly impacted by the
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:11.880]  same economic crisis that Greece are currently laboring under so again it's
[1:18:11.880 --> 1:18:16.320]  just another victim of this globalist onslaught and it's similar to other
[1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:21.600]  European countries like Switzerland where there's a large number of the
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:26.440]  population that are aware of it I mean I was heartened when we were at
[1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:31.760]  Bilderberg just to see the the to the level at which the Swiss people were so
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:35.160]  informed and committed to the cause because you don't see that in a lot of
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.880]  countries so people need to know that there is an informed active determined
[1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:44.920]  young base that's out there that are willing to try and rescue their own
[1:18:44.920 --> 1:18:49.280]  country and it's it's sweeping Europe it's sweeping America and we just need
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:53.360]  to be patient because it's not going to happen overnight I'm with you there
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:58.000]  let's thank you for the call Kevin let's go now to Aaron and Nevada
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:02.160]  man how you doing I haven't always been the biggest fan of Aaron Dykes to be
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:06.560]  frank but I tell you you really impressed me with your work there at
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:13.480]  Bilderberg very confident very salient and also Watson from United Queen them
[1:19:13.480 --> 1:19:17.920]  there I really like all the work that you do and everything really awesome
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:22.920]  here's the thing I think though that we need to be less ambiguous about this
[1:19:22.920 --> 1:19:28.000]  term globalist which I hear everybody using nowadays I think it's a bit of a
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:34.440]  misnomer but I think we have to be more specific and name names so we can target
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:40.000]  our protest against those particular individuals held them as opposed to this
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:44.880]  generic globalist term which is I think ambiguous to a lot of people on my
[1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:48.720]  radio show at goonard.com me and Bob Chapman had a little game show called
[1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:52.080]  that name the globalist just so we could start be hang right there and we're
[1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:55.040]  gonna come back to you after the break but we have the list in front of us I
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:58.480]  can read the names they're in the CFR and the other groups back after this

[1:24:00.440 --> 1:24:10.840]  no one knows what it's like to be the bad man to be the sad man
[1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:16.240]  we're back again on the Alex Jones show infowars.com I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:20.920]  while Alex is away on the line with me Paul Joseph Watson coming up in just a
[1:24:20.920 --> 1:24:26.200]  few minutes Alex Minesh of the Info Creek also a fellow witness to the 2011
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:30.760]  Bilderberg meeting and coming up later Bob Chapman but the caller was bringing
[1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:34.600]  up how we've maybe been a little too vague about the globalist I don't think
[1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:40.040]  so I think it's has something to do with having a time to talk about it all
[1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:45.120]  this is the military industrial complex the agri-industrial complex the
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:50.520]  political power complex it's a cartel of insiders a lot of them are in groups
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:54.880]  like the Council on Foreign Relations the Bilderberg meetings the
[1:24:54.880 --> 1:24:59.760]  trilateral Commission it all stems from the Anglo-American Empire the Cecil
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:04.440]  Roads roundtable groups meeting in secret getting advanced decisions
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:11.080]  abilities to steer markets and political wars political markets decisions
[1:25:11.080 --> 1:25:18.880]  rather in advance without oversight Paul Watson who are the globalists well
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:22.880]  just look at the Bilderberg attendee list I mean we published it all the names
[1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:26.920]  are right there those are the most prominent individuals specifically the
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:31.560]  ones on the steering committee like Davignon because they meet more than
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:37.520]  once a year they have several meetings a year at which the the progress of the
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:42.240]  agendas that they seek to implement are reviewed remember that when Bilderberg
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:45.560]  say oh we don't even implement we don't implement policy at any of these
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:50.240]  meetings they're right in a sense but it's about creating the consensus it's
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.640]  like Willie Klase the former NATO Secretary-General said they're told to
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:58.600]  go away and implement the this consensus in their respective spheres of
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:04.080]  influence so I mean the list is there I mean we published it we're naming them
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:08.640]  what became apparent to me was just how weak and pathetic these people are
[1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:13.240]  because you know if they're so proud of this new world order then why was some
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.560]  of them hiding their faces behind newspapers driving around in cars with
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:23.680]  black tinted windows it's like Skelton talks about in his latest article I mean
[1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:29.440]  they hide their anonymity behind giant shower curtains and armed guards and yet
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:33.920]  we're supposed to prove our identification everywhere we go or
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:37.880]  we're labeled terrorists but if you see these people driving past in their
[1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:43.240]  stupid little tinted window cars cars hiding their faces it just brings it
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:47.960]  home how weak and pathetic they really are and we've named them the list is out
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:52.360]  there so people should be under no illusions as to who the globalists are
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:56.440]  maybe it'd be easier to think of them as arrogant weasels imposing this
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:27:01.760]  globalization on us let's go to another call Tim in Germany are you there yes
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:07.840]  I'm here good to talk to you you as well and thanks for you guys work in
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:14.720]  Switzerland really appreciate what you've done there what Paul said earlier
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:20.000]  would like to comment as well it's I think sometimes it's important to go
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:25.880]  to these demonstrations and show faith and make clear that many people oppose
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:30.000]  it but then there's always these examples of these anti-war protests that
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:33.920]  happened in the UK where I think close to a million people went to the streets
[1:27:33.920 --> 1:27:40.960]  and opposed UK's involvement in the Iraq invasion and it was just yeah it was
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:45.640]  just not minded at all people ignore or the politicians or globalists ignored
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:51.360]  it completely and obviously there is a time for protest but many of these
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:56.920]  protests are just wiped away and ignored and I think a big and an important
[1:27:56.920 --> 1:28:02.960]  thing is in the info is even for the keyboard warriors definitely they
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:08.400]  shouldn't gripe and they shouldn't say how powerless we are and destroy hope
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:12.040]  because if there's no hope people will never start fighting they will not pick
[1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:18.240]  up the fight or they will give up at the slightest resistance but I think what
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:24.200]  what is an important thing coming also from the keyboard or talking to people
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.960]  wherever you meet them in for war is we need to change the consciousness of the
[1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:31.800]  people we need to make them aware and often enough people will go to a
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:37.280]  demonstration and it will be a hit thing maybe or it will be a momentaneous
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:42.760]  outcry but then they will withdraw from from really conscious a change of
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:47.800]  consciousness so I think all of these aspects are important in the info also
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:52.640]  the keyboard boys as long as it's not destroying hope because hope is the most
[1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:57.200]  important thing in in all of this fight I couldn't agree more we have to keep
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:01.800]  hope alive thanks for the call Tim of course in the case of Bilderberg only a
[1:29:01.800 --> 1:29:06.560]  few years ago the meeting itself was never reported in newspapers maybe four
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:11.520]  times over 50 years now in the past five six seven eight years we've seen
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:17.320]  protesters beginning to show up first just a few used to just be Jim Tucker
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:22.680]  then a few dozen now it's up to over a hundred even in a remote part not close
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:27.000]  to a city so I think there's progress there as far as the wars they're
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.400]  committed to it so they're gonna double down so that's why they don't care what
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:33.800]  the protesters say but that doesn't mean we don't have power we're gonna get more
[1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:38.680]  on to that on the other side of the break this is m4wars.com Aaron Dyke
[1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:43.440]  sitting in Alex Jones will be back Sunday live
[1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:57.200]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:03.680]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[1:30:03.680 --> 1:30:08.160]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:12.280]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:16.320]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:20.200]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:30:20.200 --> 1:30:24.480]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:28.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:32.960]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:36.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.880]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[1:33:25.760 --> 1:33:31.520]  and we're gonna bring in now Alex Minesh of info kree over in Germany he's
[1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:35.200]  going to talk about some of the things we saw at the meeting but of course we
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:40.400]  have seen come out of the Bilderberg meetings agenda from 2011 directly a
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:46.520]  call for a wider world war three type scenario heavier war in Libya continuing
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:51.760]  crackdown on activist and anti-war people in the United States while
[1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:59.280]  continuing to foment anti-regime change in a regime change through anti-dictator
[1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:03.960]  groups supposedly in these Middle East regions in China in Russia and in
[1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:11.800]  related places let's go now to Alex Minesh hey guys good to see you watching
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:18.400]  you on the screen as well good to have you here yeah with the writing an
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:27.040]  article linking Bilderberg and as well as the dynasties behind Bilderberg not
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:32.760]  just to Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon papers believes in the past they ran him
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:37.960]  the special existence of this and they put pressure on Nixon made it look bad
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:45.040]  and towards Vietnam and today we have the new Ellsberg which of course Julian
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:52.440]  Assange and Assange calls Bilderberg quote vaguely conspiratorial in a
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:56.560]  networking sense that's from the same Belfast telegraph interview where he
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:35:03.280]  trashed 9-11 truth as being annoying and and a distraction so Julian Assange
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:09.080]  got this material the Afghanistan logs the Iraq logs cable gates gave them to
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:13.480]  the mainstream media and the mainstream media used that material to demonize
[1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:20.360]  Pakistan Iran their Spiegel magazine who got the exclusive story right from the
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:24.880]  start with the Afghanistan logs their Spiegel in their coverage and we cover
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:31.480]  this as well as the time they demonized General Hamid Ghul from Pakistan they
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:36.400]  said he runs Al Qaeda in the Taliban and he's the reason German soldiers get shot
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:43.680]  off so this is the diabolical propaganda and all these magazines that basically
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:49.920]  the same kind of coverage they said well the war on terror wasn't pretty so far
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:56.080]  it could have been handled better but essentially it was necessary and just a
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:01.800]  hundred thousand dead in Iraq completely focused numbers by the way and so the
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:07.720]  war on terror wasn't so bad up until now and has to be expanded because Iran and
[1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:12.480]  Pakistan are the reason we're not completely winning yeah and you're
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.360]  talking of course about Julian Assange and the WikiLeaks phenomenon new 21st
[1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:22.320]  century approach to probing and pushing the buttons of geo strategic tension
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:28.360]  across the map I'm looking right in here at an article from January 13 2011
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:33.640]  Tunisia the first WikiLeaks revolution this was actually an article in foreign
[1:36:33.640 --> 1:36:38.400]  policy the magazine of record for the council and foreign relations and we've
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:43.080]  really seen the WikiLeaks be a limited hangout in many ways you mentioned
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:49.400]  Daniel Ellsberg there's a whole book The Secret Team written by well the name
[1:36:49.400 --> 1:36:55.480]  escapes me sorry yeah Fletcher Proudie thank you Fletcher Proudie's book The
[1:36:55.480 --> 1:37:00.360]  Secret Team really exposes how Daniel Ellsberg was a limited hangout he
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:06.200]  redirected blame and analysis of the CIA which was then just claiming some of its
[1:37:06.200 --> 1:37:10.600]  most outrageous powers blaming it on the military meanwhile we have these
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:15.320]  Bilderberg members really they are the war powers behind the scene there's
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:20.600]  Prince Bernhardt who was once part of IG Farben and a Nazi SS officer to boot
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:28.760]  Alex continue please and and also when we talk about the cyber terrorism and
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:37.000]  an upcoming event that might get this world war going I remember a documentary
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:42.520]  which never was never officially released it's called hackers wanted it
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:47.320]  leaked on the internet you might want to check this out hackers wanted and it
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:52.040]  focuses on a hacker called Adrian Lamos who is of course connected to this whole
[1:37:52.040 --> 1:38:01.320]  WikiLeaks affair Lamos is the guy who supposedly betrayed the source Bradley
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:05.440]  Manning to the government and Adrian Lamos it's the work for Homeland
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:11.520]  Security as well and in this documentary you see a couple of I mean it's a
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:17.880]  couple of counter-terrorism government officials and they say now is the time
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:24.080]  hackers start joining the US government because Al Qaeda or some foreign
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:30.640]  country might come after us with a two-pronged attack first the cyber
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:36.080]  attack shutting off power lines power grid phone system to drive people out on
[1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:41.040]  the street and the crowded city like New York or LA when you have that many
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:47.600]  people on the streets then Al Qaeda or some other nefarious country in the
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:54.000]  scenario would then spread a deadly virus and you would have a much higher body
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:58.880]  count than you would have had with just the biological attack so this is the
[1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:05.360]  hacker propaganda and also be the cyber terrorist propaganda very very very
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:12.800]  dangerous and also if you look at this this entire WikiLeaks situation you see
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:19.040]  that from the chat logs between Bradley Manning the alleged source for many of
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:24.440]  those WikiLeaks releases and hacker Adrian Lamos in the chat logs Manning
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:30.720]  talks about the kind of software to use he said I was using for the anonymizing
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:36.960]  system to communicate secretly and by now we know that the Torah is the majority
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:42.600]  funded by the United States government they have a huge budget and they produce
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:49.080]  these kind of anonymizing privacy programs and networks and they want to
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:54.760]  use these networks for groups dissident groups in Iran in all these countries
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:40:02.280]  you can look that up you can find that very quickly and so if crypto John Young
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:08.960]  from crypto published some of the Torah tax returns can see his government on
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:14.760]  this and so you might think the government would put in a backdoor in
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:19.800]  this and the lead program or one of the lead program as Jacob Applebaum he
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:23.320]  talked about yeah there's some backdoors in it and some weaknesses we've known
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:29.800]  about them for a couple of months now and we heard Iran is using deep packet
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:35.560]  infection now so they can actually track and block Torah meaning they can
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:41.560]  potentially find out who the dissident are this is an entire complex an entire
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:48.840]  web of government sponsored groups and hackers and what I call data laundering
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:57.040]  so you had these these Afghanistan logs Iraq logs cable gaze and then you somehow
[1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:03.440]  they ended up with Bradley Manning and somehow Bradley Manning transferred them
[1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:11.160]  to WikiLeaks and now the material seems to be believable and a lot more a lot
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:14.360]  more pertinent because it doesn't come from the government directly it's
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:19.200]  supposed to be inside information well Alex Panesha out thank you for that
[1:41:19.200 --> 1:41:23.080]  analysis I want to get back to Paul Watson as well get his take on it but
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:26.240]  looking forward we of course have this week here in the Financial Times
[1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:31.840]  hackers claim CIA website disruption for those of you who just joined us only
[1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:36.280]  days after getting a cyber security alert out of the Bilderberg meetings we're
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:42.000]  seeing CIA website and a host of other sites Sony Nintendo Australian
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.640]  broadcasters and more among them going down who does that really benefit does
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:52.000]  that really harm the CIA when their partners in crime the NSA really want
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:57.920]  to bring in greater internet control and prepare us to accept a cyber false flag
[1:41:57.920 --> 1:42:02.840]  attack when really it's not even clear how vulnerable the system would be in
[1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:08.520]  the past several years I believe for the past four in a row we've had USA's
[1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:14.760]  General Keith B. Alexander director of the NSA at the Bilderberg meetings
[1:42:14.760 --> 1:42:19.280]  meeting year after year on cyber terrorism Paul Watson I really feel like
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:23.120]  they might be planning something could it help with this Middle East agenda as
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:27.360]  well as the domestic clampdown well that's precisely what they're planning
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:31.720]  and I mean remember this whole cyber security agenda was founded on the
[1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:37.600]  boilerplate hacking example of the Stuxnet which of course later as the
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:44.720]  New York Times report on January 15th 2011 they said that the virus was
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:49.880]  designed as an American Israeli project to sabotage the Iranian program and then
[1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:54.520]  Ralph Langner bragged at the big Ted conference where all the globalists
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:42:59.680]  attend and Bill Gates but yes it was the it was Israel and the United States with
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:04.880]  the United States being the leading party in launching that Stuxnet attack so
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:07.520]  they're the ones behind it and they're going to be behind it in the
[1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:11.880]  future and it's going to be blamed on these rogue extremist groups and
[1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:16.720]  eventually it's going to be used to enact this Chinese style internet that
[1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:21.120]  Joe Lieberman and others have passed which is based on the premise that
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:25.360]  Homeland Security can just make a phone call and get your website shut down
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:30.480]  which in a convoluted sense is what happened with WikiLeaks because they
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:36.240]  had their website hosted on Amazon's cloud server and Homeland Security just
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:39.840]  put a telephone call through and it was shut down so that's why they're moving
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:44.800]  everyone over to this so-called secure internet to this cloud system where you
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:49.480]  basically hand over all your content over to whoever runs that system but on
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:54.160]  the subject of hackers it was admitted that one in four of hackers in the United
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:58.520]  States work for the US government so of course they've completely infiltrated
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:03.040]  this area as Alex was just discussing and they're going to use it for false
[1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:07.640]  flag cyber attacks even though the internet you know the new plants the
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:11.040]  power lines they're not even connected to the internet but they're going to say
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:15.360]  that it's connected so they can use it as a as a pretext to take over the
[1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:20.040]  entire internet and the communication system yeah and dovetailing with that
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:23.840]  we have the combating online infringement and counterfeits that in the
[1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:27.800]  US which are they've already used to shut down gambling sites there's also the
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:32.240]  EU intellectual property rights strategy they really want to force of course
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:36.400]  YouTube is part of that bigger system but sites like YouTube they want to force
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:41.680]  them to shut down everyone preemptively before you can even defend whether or
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:45.560]  not you have a right to use something that may be questionably in copyright I
[1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:49.640]  think that really goes hand-in-hand with this cyber agenda and why there are so
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:54.800]  many big wigs of the online world now at Bilderberg meeting each year Alex
[1:44:54.800 --> 1:45:02.120]  been asked what is your take on that well obviously we we were we had the
[1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:07.800]  experience of seeing how technology can protect us that the technology race
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:14.640]  really it's up against the globalist power brokers and so we were using
[1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:19.720]  technology for our benefit we were shooting we're streaming live and there
[1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:27.440]  was one incident when we were chasing Ray Bilderberger's up a mountain in my
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:32.160]  car and and this was an off-limits mountain and we got fine for the
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:38.080]  infraction and we were driving up this very narrow road being chased by police
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:41.880]  and this officer probably thought well I'm the king of the hill up here you
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:46.600]  know this is the lonely hill I can do anything up here what he didn't know was
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:52.680]  that Paul the entire time with streaming live over the internet you I don't know
[1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:57.440]  how many people that's right they've used all the social media to break through
[1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:00.880]  the walls of Iran and other countries that want to clamp down but I don't
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:04.520]  think the Bilderberg group ever expected us to turn that around on them they
[1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:08.720]  couldn't confiscate our footage they couldn't take away tapes or make us go
[1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:12.680]  away because it was all happening in real time Paul Watson what do you make of
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:18.360]  all that well I mean they're furious about that they can't stand it the
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:22.040]  fact that we can stream live to the internet and it's automatically archived
[1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:26.520]  but again that's why they're trying to move all the content over to the cloud
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:30.800]  network where you don't control it it's not on your servers of course as I
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:35.800]  mentioned earlier Apple has now got the paint and whereby they can send out
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:40.760]  infrared sent signals that block your ability to film something on your iPhone
[1:46:40.760 --> 1:46:46.040]  if you're at quote an event and then it's if you're at a museum and you know
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:50.880]  if you're at a protest it goes on and on so they're definitely scared stiff of
[1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:54.640]  the alternative media and the fact that we can have this instant outreach to the
[1:46:54.640 --> 1:46:58.320]  internet and they're gonna try every dirty trick in the book to try and
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:01.880]  prevent us from doing that but that's a high-tech dirty trick that the Bilderberg
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:06.680]  group have been using for years I was talking to Alex Alex Jones earlier
[1:47:06.680 --> 1:47:10.760]  about in 2008 when the we are change group found out the golf course the
[1:47:10.760 --> 1:47:14.760]  public golf course the members were playing on showed up to talk David
[1:47:14.760 --> 1:47:19.840]  Rockefeller and the others and then all of a sudden security walked over picked
[1:47:19.840 --> 1:47:24.720]  out one individual guy from the crowd kind of a new guy that nobody knew too
[1:47:24.720 --> 1:47:30.920]  well and suddenly pulled out oh he has a gun he has a weapon now everyone has to
[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:35.040]  leave now no one's allowed in this area we saw a direct parallel to that this
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:39.720]  year in 2011 at Bilderberg where they had a false bomb scare they claimed
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:44.200]  someone was going to commit a terrorist attack against the meeting they
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:49.000]  blocked off the road for hours as they built up another wall to block viewing
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:53.120]  these members and they really tried to push back against the protesters as we
[1:47:53.120 --> 1:47:57.400]  mentioned earlier during Bilderberg they took passports and told people they
[1:47:57.400 --> 1:48:01.760]  weren't allowed to film police told them they'd be arrested knowing they had
[1:48:01.760 --> 1:48:06.240]  limited knowledge of all the finer points of swiss law really just trying to
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:10.480]  intimidate everyone and I don't think it's working but they've been pulling
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:14.480]  these dirty tricks for years Alex Pinesh what was you what did you make of
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:22.640]  that well we've seen the local newspaper out of Kanol Bunsen kind of
[1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:29.280]  the state the conference the conference was taken place then and the local
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:35.000]  paper on Saturday Saturday of the conference had an article on Bilderberg
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:42.720]  and they quoted from the police website and it said in regards to these two
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:47.840]  people arrested with the bomb scare is that yeah we were searching for four
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:54.600]  hours we thought it was more like one and a half and we found that it was not a
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:49:01.960]  bomb it looked like one it looked like tubing and those two arrested they
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:06.360]  would they would have to pay the bill it is expected they would have to pay the
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:11.560]  bill for four hours of bomb searching so we don't know if this was just
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:18.200]  harassment if people were acting stupid and had like a bomb or something or if
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:23.600]  those two are just provocateurs delivering a reason to close off that
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:29.840]  main road yeah then we saw one official members of Parliament there in
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:33.680]  Switzerland tried to enter the group as well as when an Italian member of the
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.680]  EU Parliament tried to enter the group of course he was kind of sneaking in the
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:43.040]  police really reacted with brutality in the case of the EU Italian member
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:48.480]  beating him pushing him down blooding his nose to the Swiss Parliament really
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:52.640]  letting them know they're not welcome even as they tried to route out the
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:57.920]  likes of Kissinger they also separately stopped a George W. Bush speaking
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:02.040]  engagement because they were afraid of protesters and afraid of an unfriendly
[1:50:02.040 --> 1:50:05.960]  climate and a country that loves sovereignty I really think it's gonna
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:10.080]  backfire against them it's awesome almost a Gandhi-like moment when a
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:14.800]  protester could just be beat down by a group that refuses to unleash its
[1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:20.280]  secrecy that refuses to disclose what's going on behind closed doors while
[1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:24.280]  mandating trying to implement trying to force a centralized system upon
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:29.200]  everyone obviously the group affects everything going on in the world but
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:33.560]  ordinary people are not allowed to know Paul Watson yeah and then of course on
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:37.680]  the final day we had the secret police guy basically standing with us the whole
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:41.960]  time which was very interesting to say the least we could touch on that after
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:46.520]  the break absolutely we'll be back on the other side I'm Aaron Dykes filling in

[1:52:20.360 --> 1:52:25.720]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:30.640]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:35.040]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:38.760]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:42.720]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:48.280]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:36.760]  before restructuring the government we also have the potential for it to
[1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:41.760]  spread to Portugal Spain Ireland and it'll have great implications for the
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:46.600]  United States as well as it continues its imperial powers we were talking
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:52.120]  earlier with Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Banish of InfoKrieg in Germany to
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:58.000]  fellow witnesses to the 2011 Bilderberg meeting in St. Merritt Switzerland I want
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:02.560]  to let everyone know that Info Wars now has a newsletter the Info Wars Insider
[1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:07.960]  it's going out today I believe but it's also going out Tuesday with the total
[1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:13.240]  coverage of the World War 3 agenda we played earlier Alex's video Obama and
[1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:18.360]  starting World War 3 and he's certainly doing that expanding us into more than
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:23.320]  five wars and continuing to press buttons also coming out in that Tuesday
[1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:28.280]  inside edition of the Info Wars the Info Wars Insider that is still going to
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:32.360]  use to that name will be some of the inside coverage of Bilderberg some of
[1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:35.760]  our exclusive footage some of the things we're talking about and then there'll be
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:41.920]  a longer piece coming out in about a week or within a week with more than an
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:46.880]  hour of exclusive Bilderberg footage an interview with Jim Tucker his breakdown
[1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:52.440]  of things and Jim Tucker is really just great to see him because his spirit you
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:56.680]  could see him glowing like so many of the activists he's very enthused and
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:00.680]  excited obviously that so many young people so many old people as well are
[1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:05.800]  beginning to fight the Bilderberg Info War head-on by showing up in person we
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:09.920]  had a great turnout but Paul Watson as you mentioned we also encountered a
[1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:14.320]  secret police kind of guy standing amongst the protesters as if he was
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:20.480]  with us we saw him actually communicating with police who came over to him and he
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:25.800]  fed them information but we confronted him didn't we Paul well that's right and
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:29.360]  I mean the only time he ever really spoke to anyone was after the conference
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:33.640]  was ending and the police were pulling down the shower curtain he spoke to them
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:37.920]  and then he immediately left but we got an interview with him on camera and he
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:42.000]  obviously had some base knowledge of what the issues were which he was trained
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:47.280]  to spew but it was obviously he was secret police but the fact that we got
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:51.240]  him on camera means not so secret anymore but I mean I'd just like to say
[1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:55.240]  the camaraderie between all the activists out there it's like Alex said
[1:56:55.240 --> 1:56:59.880]  before it was like being in the trenches you know the sleep deprivation the rain
[1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:04.680]  the cold but everybody really pulled together and really helped us out in a
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:10.360]  number of ways people like Dominique Luke Fabianne John Tim Stefan Alex of
[1:57:10.360 --> 1:57:14.160]  course is with us now all the we are changed Switzerland guys just want to
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:18.520]  give a big shout out to them because they were great and I was really heartened
[1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:22.440]  and encouraged by the coverage the organization the commitment that these
[1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:27.080]  guys were committed to in their own country in Switzerland there I really
[1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:31.120]  would I was because you could see we all have more potential in our pinky
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:36.280]  finger than some of those old crusty guys inside the hotel we really are
[1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:40.560]  giants and our consciousness is beginning to awaken I don't mean mine and
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:43.840]  yours are particular because we're just individuals as well in this info war
[1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:48.160]  everywhere I go in the country there's a we are changed group or Ron Paul group
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:52.640]  or some kind of other decentralized activist group and they're always just
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:56.160]  getting the work done it was no different surprisingly wonderfully in
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:58:00.800]  Switzerland they have a whole German language movement Alex Banesh from
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:06.000]  Germany just one of many people really we are changed Switzerland hosted a whole
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:11.400]  event mostly in German but with enough English translations they have rap
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:15.440]  groups there singing about the info war and on and on it was just incredible to
[1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:20.680]  see I want to thank Alex Banesh for joining us and tell him bye right now
[1:58:20.680 --> 1:58:25.000]  coming up in just a moment Bob Chapman and more of your calls this is the info

[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:20.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:34.920]  Alex Jones we are live now in the third hour on this Friday June 17th I'm
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:40.040]  Aaron Dykes I'm sitting in while Alex Jones is away on story but he will be
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:45.200]  back in full force live Sunday with plenty to cover as World War three
[2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:50.840]  begins to break out as the Libya war begins to go hot as Obama continues to
[2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:55.000]  resist any kind of congressional oversight or authority completely
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:00.400]  rebuking the idea that even the War Powers Act really a loose compromise only
[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:04.360]  recently put in place even that that wouldn't hold him back because the
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:09.680]  level of tensions and escalation and violence in Libya don't warrant anything
[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:14.480]  he would consider to be a war on the other hand researchers now count up to
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:21.240]  five wars that Obama the peacemaker the Orwellian dictator has us engaged in
[2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:26.560]  we're still in Iraq obviously we're still in Afghanistan and fresh in the news
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:31.680]  today Paul Watson Prince of Planet calm that we want a permanent presence in
[2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:38.520]  Iraq that's on the websites also grease falling in riots the government the
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:43.160]  Bilderberger pop Andrew getting ready to step down but only after restructuring
[2:01:43.160 --> 2:01:47.000]  the government and making sure people in line with the policies are in place
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:51.480]  trying to make sure many of those austerity cuts do go through even as
[2:01:51.480 --> 2:01:56.360]  the people completely say no to taking on the debt that was never theirs it was
[2:01:56.360 --> 2:02:00.480]  always the bankers and as the Bilderberg group and the other elitist in this
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:05.000]  world prepare to deal with the looming euro crisis what will happen when
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:08.760]  Greece defaults on the debt will it spread to Spain will it spread to
[2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:12.640]  Portugal how long until it affects the United States I'm looking here at a
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:18.760]  fresh report IMF cuts U.S. growth forecast warrants of crisis San Paulo
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:23.200]  Reuters the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for U.S. economic
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:26.920]  growth on Friday and worn Washington and dead written European countries that
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:30.720]  they are playing with fire unless they take immediate steps to reduce their
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:34.840]  budget deficits but of course they largely refuse to do that as they
[2:02:34.840 --> 2:02:39.080]  commit us to greater and greater true presence in the Middle East and it
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:43.080]  really appears that World War three looms so much is going on I want to go
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:48.200]  now to Bob Chapman the international forecaster really an economic guru and
[2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:54.840]  a talisman of all things economic and political are you there Bob I certainly
[2:02:54.840 --> 2:03:00.200]  am and that was a great overview well thank you I hardly know where to begin I
[2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:04.640]  wish I could do it greater justice it seems like that that small window of
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:09.800]  time before things really hit the fan and I think you have to take each part
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:18.040]  separately the hottest is Greece and we know George Papandreou made a deal with
[2:03:18.040 --> 2:03:26.680]  the bankers prior to becoming elected and that was to collateralize debt that
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:31.720]  would be money lent to the Greek government in the form of bonds and have
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:37.240]  collateral behind him in case the bonds weren't paid the interest wasn't paid
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:45.200]  and obviously he received funds from them in order to run so he could win the
[2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:50.600]  election that's the only way I can figure that out for those who don't know
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:56.600]  his father Andrews another communist and another member of the builder group
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:02.400]  builder burger group in the Illuminati probably was the worst government during
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:07.960]  the mid-1980s that Greece has ever had and he lived he looted the country as
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:15.960]  best he could I like Alex have been on radio and television and in the
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:23.040]  newspapers in Greece along with Max Kaiser for the last year or more all of
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:30.000]  us with generally the same message tell the bankers to take a hike and that's
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  what's going to happen and the ramifications are very large yesterday
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:41.640]  Max was on with Bob I need you to hold that thought because we're going to
[2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:45.840]  break but we're gonna be back on the other side with the long segment coming
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:50.800]  up I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in for Alex Jones back on Sunday but don't miss this
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:55.200]  it's gonna be really important infowars.com
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:03.880]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:05:03.880 --> 2:05:08.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[2:05:08.240 --> 2:05:12.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:16.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:20.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:24.640]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:05:24.640 --> 2:05:28.800]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:33.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[2:05:33.080 --> 2:05:36.800]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[2:05:36.800 --> 2:05:41.000]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:43.960]  mind folks I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by
[2:05:43.960 --> 2:05:48.000]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:14.160]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[2:07:14.160 --> 2:07:18.680]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:23.480]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:27.840]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:07:27.840 --> 2:07:33.080]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:37.400]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists
[2:07:37.400 --> 2:07:40.880]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:07:40.880 --> 2:07:46.120]  checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:07:46.120 --> 2:07:51.800]  have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD

[2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:25.400]  We're back in the first long segment of the third hour joining us is Bob Chapman
[2:08:25.400 --> 2:08:30.520]  the international forecaster and we were just beginning to get into the whole
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:35.960]  Greece situation and as you say it's not our debt it's not their debt but could
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:40.760]  you recap Bob how did they get us on the hook for this how did they bring about
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:44.400]  this crisis and try to put it on the people and didn't they know they would
[2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:54.120]  resist? Excuse me this started in 1974 when David Rockefeller visited Greece at
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:09:00.080]  that time the government had had a coup by the military and the military were in
[2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:04.640]  power two or three years and David told them that the communists were going to
[2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:10.120]  come and get them and so they better load up with all kinds of classy American
[2:09:10.120 --> 2:09:16.520]  equipment which they did and that really started the spiral it goes back that far
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:31.040]  and when Greece applied the due date was 1101 to be in the the Eurozone and
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:41.240]  adopt the Euro as a currency they used credit swaps and other devices to hide
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:46.160]  the terrible situation that they had financially but just so they could get
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:54.560]  into the Eurozone the other members like that they look the other way and they
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:10:00.840]  did the same thing with Italy who did something similar who should not have
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:07.560]  been accepted at that time as well but anyway the evolutionary process of debt
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:13.840]  has been going on for years politician to politician and a good part of it was
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:20.120]  kept away from the Greek populace because it was hidden by using credit
[2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:27.400]  default swaps and other devices and so it came to a head about a year and a
[2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:34.440]  quarter year and a half ago and the Greek people really generally didn't know
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:39.680]  what was going on in fact I think a lot of the politicians didn't either so no
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:46.800]  the president has a situation where he is lacking 20 votes which belong to the
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:53.320]  other party which is run by Mr. Samaras and who Mr. Pompandreou has been
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:58.400]  trying to make deals with for the last few weeks to no avail because Mr.
[2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:03.400]  Pompandreou wants to sell out the Greek people by collateralizing debt and I
[2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:06.880]  don't think they should do it and just as an example of this collateralization
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:13.720]  process just recently a German group which owned part of the telecom bought
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:21.360]  another piece of it for 30 cents on the dollar so what they wanted to do and what
[2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:26.240]  they would like to do and that's why the International Chamber of Commerce and
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:33.160]  the Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase representatives have been going in and
[2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:41.360]  out of Athens for the past a month or so perhaps longer and they want to buy you
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:47.880]  know bid for the airport and bid for the ports and buy the islands and so on and
[2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:52.520]  then I gotta get away with it the Greek people are not dumb they may be laid
[2:11:52.520 --> 2:12:01.000]  back they may like a short work week and retiring at 50 but they know what's
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:06.960]  going on now and I think Alex and Max and I have helped that process in fact I
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:13.320]  think we have been very instrumental in what's going on right now in Greece
[2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:17.000]  because I get that from subscribers there as well as people in government
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:23.560]  who contact me but anyway they they can't and they won't pay the debt back
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:29.080]  they're gonna default now there's 33 banks that hold not only a large amount
[2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:37.360]  of bonds in for Greece which they purchased but they also hold bonds for
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:44.440]  other sick nations such as Ireland and Portugal and I think Spain and Belgium
[2:12:44.440 --> 2:12:50.200]  and Italy are not far behind and what are we talking about well I guessed
[2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:56.080]  about a little over a year ago I said it'll cost them four trillion to clean
[2:12:56.080 --> 2:13:02.360]  up the mess which they don't have now my figures got up to six trillion and so
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:06.560]  there's no way of bailing them out even the healthy countries like particularly
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:11.120]  Germany isn't going to doesn't want to and they're willing to take their losses
[2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:17.560]  and the electric saw ported that out in the recent elections where the party
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:26.040]  cdu Christian Democratic Union that is led by Mrs. Merkel was soundly defeated
[2:13:26.040 --> 2:13:37.480]  in her home area and the in the area around Hamburg and and so the German
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:41.000]  people say we don't want to do that in fact I never wanted to be in the euro
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:44.440]  zone in the first place if you go back and you look at the percentage figure
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:49.640]  67 to 69% of the people did not want a euro they wanted to keep the D mark in
[2:13:49.640 --> 2:13:53.800]  Germany and quite frankly more than half of them don't even want to belong to the
[2:13:53.800 --> 2:14:00.800]  European Union but getting back to what is at stake here you've got a whole bunch
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:04.480]  of banks with bonds you get governments with bonds in Greece and those other
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:13.600]  failed countries will call them and the numbers are atrocious and it just so
[2:14:13.600 --> 2:14:20.960]  happens that in the case of Greece the losses about a hundred and twenty to a
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:25.960]  hundred and thirty billion dollars are covered by credit default swaps which
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:33.080]  were issued sold by American banks and I was thinking about this today when I
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:41.680]  was watching Max and Alex talk in the previous broadcast and you know I always
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:52.480]  suspected that when the MBS and the CDOs which were bonds that contained
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:59.200]  mortgages 60% of those were sold to European banks now they all have
[2:14:59.200 --> 2:15:04.160]  attorneys they're all intelligent and they were told that these were triple A
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:10.880]  rated pieces of paper bonds one in fact they were triple B it's a difference
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:18.360]  between a 10 and a 4 10 being best and they get stuck with these things that
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:24.040]  are selling for 10 or 15 or 20 cents on the dollar and I can't help but think
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:30.760]  there was a deal made ahead of time that will sell you these bonds and if they go
[2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:37.200]  bad we'll cover you this is the Fed Fed reserve talking and the reason I say
[2:15:37.200 --> 2:15:43.920]  that is that there's never been from Europe any legal action or any criminal
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:48.480]  prosecution which would include also not only the sellers of the bonds which
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:55.040]  are banks and brokerage houses but also the raiders which are S&P Moody's and
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:16:00.320]  Finch who lied about the ratings there's absolutely no question and they should
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:05.080]  be prosecuted criminally along with the bankers but anyway I think a deal was
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:11.160]  made a deal was made ahead of time now we come full circle to what's going on
[2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:17.480]  today and we see that the credit to fall swamp backing insurance on all this
[2:16:17.480 --> 2:16:25.920]  money that was given to Greece and and bonds received what the US Fed and the
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:36.400]  Treasury have done I think have in essence protected the European banks from
[2:16:36.400 --> 2:16:42.960]  the disaster that Greece has become and we're in it we the United States are in
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:47.040]  it big time and it's not only with Greece's with the other countries as
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:50.520]  well as well as a lot of things are going on that we don't know about and
[2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:55.640]  they're never going to tell us about well obviously they're sorry obviously the
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:17:00.600]  willingness to conspire with these European banks is evidenced by Bernanke
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:06.240]  refusing to disclose who got the money but we find out two years later it was
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:11.960]  largely European banks who were given this money and it all absolutely right
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:15.080]  Aaron and that's why I didn't tell anybody and they said it was a state
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:20.680]  secret if you can believe that and so we know there's all kinds of things going
[2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:25.040]  on that we don't know about and they're hiding they be in the Fed they have the
[2:17:25.040 --> 2:17:32.120]  central banks and the bankers in Europe so if we have a default partial or full
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:37.480]  in Greece which I think is a wonderful thing the banks in Europe are going to
[2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:41.800]  be under pressure that some of them could go under maybe all of them could go
[2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:47.080]  under and the nation's holding Greek bonds are going to take losses big
[2:17:47.080 --> 2:17:55.040]  losses if Ireland and Portugal have any sense they're going to say well maybe we
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:18:00.360]  should do the same thing too and so then they get another problem and the losses
[2:18:00.360 --> 2:18:04.720]  also keep piling up for American banks that wrote that insurance will call it
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:11.200]  and this could be the catalyst that could bring down the whole financial system
[2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:15.000]  and these people in Europe are running around like chickens with the heads cut
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.400]  off because they don't know what to do and they never expected the Greeks would
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:24.840]  say take a hike we're not going to do that and they still think they can
[2:18:24.840 --> 2:18:30.040]  bamboozle the Greeks into making a deal with them and some of us I don't think
[2:18:30.040 --> 2:18:36.440]  is going to do it and I'll say another thing that after Mr. Pompandreos out of
[2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:39.520]  office he better leave the country because I don't think he can ever live
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:44.080]  there again and many of the representatives who have sided with
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:48.160]  him have already said that when they go to the districts people attack them and
[2:18:48.160 --> 2:18:52.440]  beat them and maybe that's just the beginning and this sort of thing is
[2:18:52.440 --> 2:18:57.080]  going to happen all over Europe and as I said it could be the catalyst for a
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:02.440]  giant upheaval that will affect England in America in a big way it'll affect
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:06.960]  markets in a big way and that's why the stock market just dropped 900 points
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:14.360]  over approximately seven weeks and and it had been up because of anticipation of
[2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:22.400]  QE3 or something like it and I think what's happening here is the bank is in
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:27.400]  Europe of lost control and if you want to have another look at that and just
[2:19:27.400 --> 2:19:32.240]  listen to what Alex has had to say about the Bilderberger meeting and very
[2:19:32.240 --> 2:19:39.760]  simply they were a disaster I mean I think the key was that goon from the
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:45.800]  East German security force that was hired by the Bilderberg is to protect
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:50.120]  them from all those reporters only one of the ask questions and that's all they
[2:19:50.120 --> 2:19:55.480]  did okay Bob Chapman we're facing break again we'll be back in just a few
[2:19:55.480 --> 2:19:59.080]  moments obviously Bilderberg very concerned about what's gonna happen with

[2:23:56.200 --> 2:24:24.560]  since 1976 we're back again still on this June 17th Friday broadcast Aaron
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:30.200]  Dyke sitting in still for Alex Jones will be back in full force on Sunday live
[2:24:30.200 --> 2:24:35.080]  right now we go back to Bob Chapman we're getting deep into the Greek crisis
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:38.960]  and what it means for the rest of Europe and of course the United States and
[2:24:38.960 --> 2:24:43.800]  world Bob Chapman we know that the Bilderberg group has been very concerned
[2:24:43.800 --> 2:24:49.200]  about the Euro's future for several years now they have of course been
[2:24:49.200 --> 2:24:54.320]  steering the Euro and the European Union for more than 50 years but primarily
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:58.880]  in secret now after less than a decade out in the open or close to a decade
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:04.040]  it's really crumbling before them why is that and why are they so concerned
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:10.280]  well I think you know I understand their desire and that is to have world
[2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:15.920]  government and to enslave people and I don't know you and I both don't agree
[2:25:15.920 --> 2:25:21.200]  with that I'm sure obviously but the point is that they don't look at the
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:25.320]  anthropological differences and the cultural differences of Europe and
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:29.280]  other places in the world within countries never mind from country to
[2:25:29.280 --> 2:25:37.160]  country and it's an unnatural association this unnatural association is
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:44.040]  pointed out in the fact that they have open borders in Europe and sure you can
[2:25:44.040 --> 2:25:49.600]  go back and forth between countries and just show your EU passport and off you
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:56.760]  go but as far as people moving from country to country that isn't happening
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:04.000]  and they expected that it would happen and they were defying human nature and
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:10.040]  it didn't work and just like one interest rates for all in the Euro in the
[2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:16.240]  Eurozone it couldn't possibly work because each nation is at a
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:22.800]  different level of development now with that said going back to the formation
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:29.520]  of the European the European Union the European coal and and steel community
[2:26:29.520 --> 2:26:34.280]  going back into the late 40s and 1950s something I lived through because I
[2:26:34.280 --> 2:26:41.320]  lived in Europe in those years and again totally unnatural it couldn't work and
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:45.880]  it isn't working and that's why and of course they made a lot of mistakes along
[2:26:45.880 --> 2:26:51.640]  the way well the Billy burgers you know want to force it to work and that's not
[2:26:51.640 --> 2:26:57.400]  going to happen and a good example of very very poor judgment is the
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:03.520]  continuing secret meetings that they have and all the guards in the paraphernalia
[2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:09.280]  and people won't say anything about anything that goes on inside well this
[2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:18.640]  time they went too far and this guy got this guard knocked down a member of the
[2:27:18.640 --> 2:27:25.800]  European Parliament from the Northern League in Italy and but he knocked him
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:32.280]  down head first broke his nose lacerated him and then gave him a kick for a good
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:39.000]  measure disastrous in fact when Jalix and I heard that Alex was yelling at the
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:43.240]  top of his lungs that that was great because this is going to blow the whole
[2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:47.800]  meeting and he was right and so they all left early and I don't think they
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:53.400]  accomplished very much and if I were them I wouldn't be dumb enough to have
[2:27:53.400 --> 2:28:00.440]  another Bilderberger meeting where they go in secret that be as it may they were
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:05.320]  on the run and then they got greased facing them most of whom many of whom
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:10.280]  of these Bilderbergers are bankers they're looking at horrendous losses and
[2:28:10.280 --> 2:28:15.800]  then if Ireland and Portugal follow which I'm sure they will it gets worse
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:25.160]  and Spain is the dog's breakfast it's a mess financially and they've got 40%
[2:28:25.160 --> 2:28:31.720]  unemployment among young people and the police there last week acted like a
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:36.320]  bunch of goons I had the tapes of everything just like Alex did and
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:40.760]  disseminated them now the people weren't doing anything with you and so they
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:44.560]  just beat them and you don't do those kind of things particularly in Spain and
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:51.960]  so all this is boomerang on them and the getting hit from several different
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:58.640]  sides while they are deliberately trying to extend warfare in them in the
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:06.040]  Middle East and as I predicted before like in the prediction of 9-11 Afghanistan
[2:29:06.040 --> 2:29:13.520]  in Iraq they're trying to start obviously a combination of wars not caring
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:19.920]  about the the US Congress or what the American laws are just because they want
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:24.960]  to and they think they can do anything they want this is going to be a
[2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:31.680]  diversion supposedly from all of the financial and economic problems that
[2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:35.880]  exist that they caused okay Bob I've got us I've got to cut you off one more
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:40.080]  time we're gonna come back from break and get into that final stuff and why

[2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:26.920]  Aaron Dyke sitting in and we still have Bob Chapman with us through the end of
[2:33:26.920 --> 2:33:30.840]  the hour we're going to try to jam in some phone calls as well we're really
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:35.600]  trying to break down everything happening with this economic crisis Bob
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:41.760]  Chapman it's something they really plan to capitalize on using a global crisis
[2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:46.520]  of economic proportions to bring in a global solution but it is in fact back
[2:33:46.520 --> 2:33:51.800]  firing on them as the wars expand as everything's going on before getting to
[2:33:51.800 --> 2:33:55.840]  your points on that I just want to plug again Alex has a new video Obama
[2:33:55.840 --> 2:33:59.440]  launching World War three that should be up on info wars.com
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:04.600]  presentplanet.tv and the Alex Jones channel on YouTube a very important
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:10.200]  broadcast about unfortunately the looming wider war as we have earlier
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:15.120]  reports from the week from military personnel that Obama and the US are
[2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:19.800]  planning to launch a much wider Libyan war the troops are moving in at least by
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:25.200]  September October or early November but Bob Chapman back to the economic
[2:34:25.200 --> 2:34:30.040]  forecast what does all this mean for their global solution and what will it
[2:34:30.040 --> 2:34:36.400]  mean for the United States? Well I think as far as the world elitist the
[2:34:36.400 --> 2:34:42.560]  Bilderberger types are concerned they've got an awful lot of headwind to fight
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:46.880]  against they've made some grievous errors
[2:34:46.880 --> 2:34:53.040]  underestimating the Greeks their meeting the Bilderbilder-Mürger meeting at St.
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:35:00.680]  Moritz really is a disaster for them and now banks and countries are looking
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:06.680]  down the barrel of not being able to collect in their bonds to suffer
[2:35:06.680 --> 2:35:10.440]  grievous losses and that will spread deeply to the United States and the
[2:35:10.440 --> 2:35:16.400]  hundreds of billions of dollars as well and that's something that nobody needs
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:23.120]  particularly in this case the US we still have throughout Europe England and
[2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:27.920]  the United States many many banks that are in sovereign that are being held up
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:34.600]  by infusions of capital that you never see that never reach the media being
[2:35:34.600 --> 2:35:38.560]  supplied by the Fed and other central banks in fact the European Central Bank
[2:35:38.560 --> 2:35:43.800]  is not supposed to create money out of thin air like the Fed is they're doing
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:48.920]  it anyway I mean when all is said and done you know these people should be
[2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:56.200]  prosecuted and what they're doing a criminal acts in the European Central
[2:35:56.200 --> 2:36:01.400]  Bank but most people aren't aware of that either so anyway as we go forward
[2:36:01.400 --> 2:36:07.360]  things are going to worsen and the President of the United States is doing
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:12.800]  exactly what he's being told and if Congress wants to stop them and they
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:19.400]  they've filed a lawsuit in federal the court against the President and to stop
[2:36:19.400 --> 2:36:25.880]  him from having these so-called wars or incursions or whatever the President calls
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:34.000]  them and I think the best thing for Congress to do if he ignores them is to
[2:36:34.000 --> 2:36:40.440]  bring impeachment against him now that may not stop what's going on because the
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:47.520]  Vice President does what he's told as well but the point is the American
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:52.320]  people through the representatives will have spoken and I think that probably is
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:37:01.760]  the next step because ratings are dreadful even even the polling companies
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:07.920]  that favor him so to speak have him at 49% one in fact he's probably somewhere
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:13.760]  around 39% in reality yeah you know the impeachment question I've just seen so
[2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:18.200]  many people casting doubt on themselves that oh we couldn't impeach Obama or
[2:37:18.200 --> 2:37:22.480]  Bush or whomever because the vice presidents even worse but obviously
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:27.120]  it's not only the right duty and action to take but it would clearly send a
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:31.080]  message to Biden or whoever they would be extremely careful what they did after
[2:37:31.080 --> 2:37:35.640]  that knowing that the people are furious where am I on the wrong track Bob
[2:37:35.640 --> 2:37:41.080]  no I think you're in the right track send a message and that's that's the way
[2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:44.760]  to do it I mean some of these people have been fighting on some of these
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:50.760]  issues for years and years and maybe after two years or ten years something
[2:37:50.760 --> 2:37:55.440]  finally happens if you push and push and push and that's what we have to do we
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:37:58.320]  have to let them know we know exactly what you're doing and you're not going
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:08.520]  to do it anymore yeah I'm sorry go ahead I think the culmination of problems
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:15.000]  which is in process now in Europe is going to complicate the problems in
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:18.240]  England and in the United States I haven't even talked about the U.S. which
[2:38:18.240 --> 2:38:24.080]  is federal debt which is being funded 80% by the Federal Reserve which is
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:30.440]  creating the money out of thin air and we have the municipal problems which are
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:35.720]  legion 40% of the states are on the edge of bankruptcy if not bankrupt
[2:38:35.720 --> 2:38:41.120]  although they can't go bankrupt but the point is that that's where they're at
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:47.160]  real estate much to everyone's surprise including my own I thought that maybe
[2:38:47.160 --> 2:38:53.360]  10% more we'd hit bottom no it looks like we're going even lower than that and I
[2:38:53.360 --> 2:38:59.160]  think if this continues the way it is for the next year and a half or two we
[2:38:59.160 --> 2:39:04.280]  can have every mortgage in the country on the water now that's where we're headed
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:11.440]  with that and then you have these layoffs one after another 22.4% unemployment
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:21.640]  real inflation of 10.2% and then you have the ability for people to buy things
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:27.040]  curtailed if you notice the last retail figures they were off slightly well if
[2:39:27.040 --> 2:39:32.440]  you take out the inflation they were probably off 3 or 4% and so this whole
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:38.720]  thing is like a stone and it keeps on rolling down the hill and Ephesus is
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:42.480]  near to catch it and try to bring it back up again but it looks like the main
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:48.760]  thing they've prepared for is economic riots IMF riots since at least 2008 we
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:52.320]  have headlines like the Arizona police say they're prepared as the war
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:56.520]  college warrants military must prepare for unrest in the United States it's
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:00.080]  already been happening in Europe how soon is that coming to the states will
[2:40:00.080 --> 2:40:05.920]  it be the legion city matters municipal matters you spoke of or will it be a
[2:40:05.920 --> 2:40:12.080]  bigger housing crisis or the euro itself I think that's a hard call but if you
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:21.040]  look back in history you'll see that protests riots revolution or civil
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:29.320]  war usually emanate from people who have nothing to eat and so we know when we
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:35.240]  reach that point that it's going to get bad it could happen before that it's
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:39.720]  hard to time those things very very difficult I mean I've been on this
[2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:43.800]  program for years with Alex and he's on saying gee will it happen in six months
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:48.320]  or a year I said no it's not going to I mean these people got a lot of brains
[2:40:48.320 --> 2:40:52.560]  and a lot of stamina yes they make mistakes but they still want to strangle
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:58.760]  us why because there's no way back for them they crossed the Rubicon they
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:04.680]  headed into Rome and Rome is armed and waiting for them and that's what the
[2:41:04.680 --> 2:41:10.360]  alumnus the the Bilderberg is that's what they're facing and so if they lose
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:17.080]  they lose permanently and so this is a titanic struggle a struggle that is
[2:41:17.080 --> 2:41:21.240]  one of the greatest struggles in modern history if not in the history of
[2:41:21.240 --> 2:41:25.840]  mankind well as far as the Bilderberg group itself people still have the
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:30.120]  audacity to pretend they don't affect our decisions that they aren't putting
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:34.840]  these crises into motion I could tell you I was outside the gates in 2006 in
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:39.000]  Ottawa when the intel came out and revealed they were planning to pop the
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.840]  housing bubble and unleash this crisis that was 2006 the full thing didn't
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:49.280]  happen till 2008 but obviously their hands were on the chicken switch that's
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:56.040]  right and so we have to look at the long term and we know it's not good we know
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:00.880]  where they're headed we know what the trend is and we have to do what we can
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:08.520]  to disrupt the trend and that's why we're on the radio and television and on
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:13.720]  the internet doing the things that we do to expose the truth to people like in
[2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:19.160]  Greece so that they'll understand what their rights are and if they do not say
[2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:23.800]  no then they're going to live in on their knees for the next 50 years maybe
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:29.400]  longer and so that's our job but it's the job of the people to get prepared to
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:36.320]  listen and to tell other people really what's going on and of course read the
[2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:42.920]  international forecast so that helps but I think that it's too hard to put a
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:50.960]  time frame on it it just is and I don't know whether we're gonna have violent
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:55.520]  troubles in America six months from now or three years from now but I do know
[2:42:55.520 --> 2:42:59.840]  there's a good chance and good probability that that's gonna happen no
[2:42:59.840 --> 2:43:02.760]  I understand what you're saying let's bring in some callers right now I
[2:43:02.760 --> 2:43:07.720]  believe we have Julio in Illinois are you there I am here can you hear me I
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:12.720]  can hear you what can you say to myself and Bob Chapman first off Aaron you're
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:17.760]  doing a great job filling in a great job out with the the evil out in
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:21.680]  Switzerland you guys and Paul did a magnificent job first off before I
[2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:26.320]  have a question to Bob I'm working on getting some video TSA and black
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:31.360]  uniforms are at Union Station in Chicago Illinois along with a railroad
[2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:36.680]  police I'm working on getting video of that I commute frequently into the land
[2:43:36.680 --> 2:43:41.000]  of Ronald Emmanuel the Mossad agent so I'm working on getting video up for that
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:45.720]  so again TSA black shirt uniforms in Chicago's Union station so they're
[2:43:45.720 --> 2:43:49.960]  patting down the families at the train stations I haven't seen them patting
[2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:54.920]  patting down more so of their presence there just walking around Union
[2:43:54.920 --> 2:43:58.760]  Station you know if you see something say something I actually saw a TSA
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:03.480]  Homeland Security poster at Union Station I haven't seen any pat downs yet
[2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:07.880]  but they are at Union Station so I wanted to let you know that yeah also a
[2:44:07.880 --> 2:44:12.160]  place to watch for provocations obviously in the next false flag but
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:16.320]  what's your question for Bob Chapman I was gonna say false flag is eminent the
[2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:21.520]  way Bilderberg literally the whole meeting just blew up in the elitist
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:27.800]  face mr. Chapman I wanted to ask you because we remember in 08 they do it
[2:44:27.800 --> 2:44:32.560]  every four years they come back to North America to get to bring up the next
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:36.200]  puppeteer do you think in the next upcoming meeting for Bilderberg and like
[2:44:36.200 --> 2:44:40.320]  the G20 they're gonna be much more quiet and telling you know and letting us
[2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:44.280]  know where the meetings are going to be then with this whole debt ceiling
[2:44:44.280 --> 2:44:52.380]  keying into the European crisis this is also entail them manipulating the the
[2:44:52.380 --> 2:44:56.480]  golden silver market obviously they need as much paper currency as possible to
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:01.800]  rail down the cost rail down the cost of the commodity and then secondly with
[2:45:01.800 --> 2:45:05.840]  with Greece I'm in Illinois and I read articles all the time saying Illinois is
[2:45:05.840 --> 2:45:09.160]  the next Greece I'm so proud of the Greek people for standing up what is it
[2:45:09.160 --> 2:45:12.920]  our turn why you know Paul Paul just wanted to bet a lot of people are just
[2:45:12.920 --> 2:45:16.520]  sitting on their computers not doing anything about it when are people gonna
[2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:21.160]  you know wake up and say all right we need to look at these scumbags in the
[2:45:21.160 --> 2:45:24.880]  face and say you know we're not taking this anymore and then when are we gonna
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:30.440]  bring up the charges of the Logan act to Robert Gates he was at Bilderberg he
[2:45:30.440 --> 2:45:34.000]  he and the NATO Secretary General there obviously they're getting set for World
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:38.840]  War three we should do some articles or searches I know I want to do something
[2:45:38.840 --> 2:45:42.680]  to let people know that Robert Gates violated the Logan act yeah it's not
[2:45:42.680 --> 2:45:46.920]  good enough that he's on the way out Bob Chapman what about commodities and the
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:51.240]  debt ceiling well I think that commodities are going to continue to go up
[2:45:51.240 --> 2:45:56.920]  in value and the reason why is that people will be leaving the stock market
[2:45:56.920 --> 2:46:03.960]  and the bond market said its height and you know the three month paper is zero
[2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:10.520]  return there's no interest and so you're going to have people selling and they
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:14.560]  got to have someplace to go with their money and I think they're going to load
[2:46:14.560 --> 2:46:22.720]  up in commodities and gold and silver the gentleman Leo said something about
[2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:29.080]  the gold and silver and commodity manipulation and they'll try to do it as
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:35.440]  long as they can but you know I've been in markets for 52 years and the markets
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:40.600]  bigger than everybody including the Illuminati and once it starts rolling
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:45.360]  they're not going to be able to stop it and the same thing is true with people
[2:46:45.360 --> 2:46:50.440]  finding out what they're doing throughout the world every country now has
[2:46:50.440 --> 2:46:55.000]  people who know who the bad guys are what they're trying to do and how they're
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:59.920]  trying to do it and so they're going to they're going to run into tremendous
[2:46:59.920 --> 2:47:05.200]  opposition that they never expected but what about this question of when people
[2:47:05.200 --> 2:47:09.160]  are going to stand up particularly in the US what is it going to take I guess
[2:47:09.160 --> 2:47:14.560]  you've already said that's pretty much the food issue I think that is and and I
[2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:19.240]  know the government realizes that because for the last few years I do a
[2:47:19.240 --> 2:47:29.160]  military show have for about seven years and the all of the bases have been
[2:47:29.160 --> 2:47:34.720]  shipping in freeze-dried and dehydrated food for the last three years and on the
[2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:41.680]  basis the dependents are told this is where you have to report to do if we
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:47.960]  we have a situation where there's not enough food or there's riots in the city
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:55.720]  it's usually military installations are outside of the city so to speak and so
[2:47:55.720 --> 2:48:01.080]  we know that they're preparing and all of you people should be as well you
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:05.040]  should have freeze-dried and dehydrated food in the water filter and something
[2:48:05.040 --> 2:48:09.480]  to defend your families first and then you can call 10 innocent at minus and
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:13.960]  get your golden silver coins so you'll have something to spend if the dollars
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:18.320]  out yeah I think obviously it makes sense to shift into a gradually over time
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:24.360]  let's go to another call Alan in Texas are you there you guys it's great to
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:28.560]  talk to you guys who are usually behind the scenes you guys are more important
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:34.840]  than I think some people give you credit for Mr. Watson Mr. Dykes and of course
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:37.840]  Mr. Chapman so you know it's always good to hear from you you've got great
[2:48:37.840 --> 2:48:41.680]  information I'd like to start off if I could with a quote by Martin Luther
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:47.280]  King that I think is instrumental in getting other people to wake up and
[2:48:47.280 --> 2:48:52.240]  that is he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps
[2:48:52.240 --> 2:48:56.440]  perpetrate it he who accepts evil without protesting against it is really
[2:48:56.440 --> 2:49:00.560]  cooperating with it now when you see your friends and family members saying
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:04.000]  they don't have time to get informed they don't have time to get involved but
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:07.160]  they have time to sit in front of dancing with the stars or spend hours on
[2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:11.680]  Facebook I think we need to chastise them you know they're they're kind of you
[2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:16.640]  know you know pulling kind of like a cop out we need to get more involved in
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:20.680]  our local communities talk to people at barbecues hold barbecues pass out
[2:49:20.680 --> 2:49:23.880]  flyers at our corner stores you know things like that just to get people
[2:49:23.880 --> 2:49:29.760]  informed and wake them up but Mr. Chapman my question for you is for those of
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:35.160]  us who are in very limited incomes right now do you advise us maybe selling
[2:49:35.160 --> 2:49:39.360]  off some of our meager possessions to accumulate some money to buy into silver
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:44.920]  now we can't afford gold but I myself have begun you know telling off stuff
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:49.680]  that means nothing to me you know like DVDs and and just stuff that I don't
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:53.520]  need and I'm starting to build that into silver would you recommend that for
[2:49:53.520 --> 2:49:59.400]  people absolutely I think it's a great idea and don't forget the food and the
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:03.880]  water filter and having something to keep people from charging it to your
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:09.920]  house those are all important factors the answers yes especially people who are
[2:50:09.920 --> 2:50:18.600]  older I like myself you sound like a much younger man no comment on 31 yeah I
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:29.000]  thought you were but you you you have to go down that path and even if you don't
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:34.320]  need what you're doing in the future it's like buying insurance you've got to
[2:50:34.320 --> 2:50:40.560]  have it right I have it my family has it I talked to everybody about it and it's
[2:50:40.560 --> 2:50:44.200]  extremely important the answer is yes things you don't need get rid of them
[2:50:44.200 --> 2:50:52.080]  buy silver buy gold this gold coins you can buy for 300 or so dollars Bob we're
[2:50:52.080 --> 2:50:55.640]  going back into break we're gonna take a few more calls on the other side but
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:50:59.400]  obviously we've all got to take it up a notch not only getting prepared but being
[2:50:59.400 --> 2:51:03.440]  willing to stand up against this we're too late about radiation poisoning from

[2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:43.960]  couple more calls one or two with Bob Chapman I just wanted to mention Alex's
[2:54:43.960 --> 2:54:49.240]  powerful keynote speech at the talkers convention from last Saturday is almost
[2:54:49.240 --> 2:54:53.680]  done I'm told from Rob do it's gonna be up for viewers early next week we're

[2:54:58.600 --> 2:55:03.640]  the coverage that Paul Watson and myself did in St. Merritt Switzerland and a
[2:55:03.640 --> 2:55:07.480]  longer piece for present planet TV members that's just some of the
[2:55:07.480 --> 2:55:13.000]  comment content coming up rather we have so much going on right now let's go to a
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:22.640]  few final calls do we have Warren in Connecticut yeah hi what's your phone's
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:27.680]  pretty bad can you get a question out for Bob Chapman real quick please that's
[2:55:27.680 --> 2:55:34.040]  much better okay um thank you guys for all you're doing it's um it's extremely
[2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:39.760]  important in these days anyways but um I was just thinking a little bit earlier
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:48.360]  about the endgame movie um proof of blueprint for global enslavement we I
[2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:57.480]  I would like to see another one blueprint blueprint for global freedom and you know
[2:55:57.480 --> 2:56:02.320]  the fact of matters we already got that we've got a constitution and so many of
[2:56:02.320 --> 2:56:08.240]  the problems that we've got going on right now and in my eyes are are pretty
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:15.080]  easily fixed by understanding the rule of law and and whose job it is to
[2:56:15.080 --> 2:56:18.760]  enforce the rule of law and that's that's the kings and the queens of this
[2:56:18.760 --> 2:56:24.840]  country the sovereign citizens when you have a sovereign nation you have a
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:31.280]  sovereign status person you have a sovereign government and the government
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:36.200]  is supposed to work for the people not the other way around and we've got the
[2:56:36.200 --> 2:56:42.600]  blueprint it's a constitution and and I mean if we restore the law in our own
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:47.240]  lives and then and then in you know your local government then the state
[2:56:47.240 --> 2:56:51.360]  government has to follow then uh then the federal government has to follow as
[2:56:51.360 --> 2:56:54.720]  well because the states enforce the federal laws the local governments
[2:56:54.720 --> 2:56:59.120]  enforce the state laws and we enforce the laws on our own local
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:04.520]  governments and until we start taking back our local governments we're not
[2:57:04.520 --> 2:57:08.600]  going to get much of anything fixed well I couldn't agree more obviously if we're
[2:57:08.600 --> 2:57:12.560]  not the solution there isn't going to be one and blueprint for global freedom
[2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:19.240]  it's a great idea your comments Bob Chapman oh I agree completely as you do
[2:57:19.240 --> 2:57:25.840]  and it's good to hear that so that everybody will hear it and it isn't
[2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:31.440]  just our job it's all of your jobs as well you've got to help us we can't do
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:35.680]  this thing alone and I'm talking none or two Americans but people throughout the
[2:57:35.680 --> 2:57:41.160]  entire world come on get on your horse and let's get something going whether
[2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:47.200]  it's pamphlets as was said earlier or Alex's tapes just get them out there
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:52.400]  well we're making tremendous inroads and it's a race against time because these
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:57.720]  people who are in charge are going to make a lot of mistakes believe me they
[2:57:57.720 --> 2:58:02.520]  are and each day we push them into more mistakes and we're breathing down their
[2:58:02.520 --> 2:58:07.520]  callers and you got to help us you got to get out there and start talking about
[2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:12.040]  the things that we talk about on this program it's amazing though how obvious
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:15.560]  it is that they're they're vulnerable they're not perfect people they too
[2:58:15.560 --> 2:58:19.920]  could fall and we really put the spotlight on them on this past week at
[2:58:19.920 --> 2:58:25.360]  Bilderberg 2011 coverage and here in the studio every day routing out the the
[2:58:25.360 --> 2:58:29.920]  globalist weasels who are arrogantly parading around in the emperor's lack of
[2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:33.720]  clothing thank you so much Bob Chapman it's a pleasure to talk to you
[2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:37.800]  our callers it's all we have time for back on the rebroadcast plenty going on
