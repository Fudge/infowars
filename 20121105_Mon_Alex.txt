[00:00.000 --> 00:09.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.640 --> 00:11.140]  You want answers?
[00:11.140 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:33.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.080 --> 00:35.600]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35.600 --> 00:40.520]  It's already the fifth day of November 2012 on this Monday.
[00:40.520 --> 00:47.680]  Tomorrow, the big election will be kicked off, and we will debate which globalist frontman
[00:47.680 --> 00:53.280]  will get us out of the bad situation we're in when the globalists carefully designed
[00:53.280 --> 01:00.960]  this post-industrial, anti-human, scientifically designed modern tyranny that is known as the
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.560]  New World Order we're going into.
[01:04.560 --> 01:11.560]  And we are basically headed downhill like a snowball headed for hell, as Merle Haggard
[01:11.560 --> 01:16.840]  once sang, because both parties represent the same interest.
[01:16.840 --> 01:24.040]  They just implement things a little bit different and jockey for control over the spoils.
[01:24.040 --> 01:28.880]  That said, Obama is taking over churches nationwide, destroying the First Amendment,
[01:28.880 --> 01:34.200]  telling them that they will pay for abortions for their employees on their insurance.
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.400]  They are shutting down our cold power plants that give us more than half our power.
[01:38.400 --> 01:43.880]  They are accelerating programs to ship our jobs overseas, but Romney supports that as
[01:43.880 --> 01:45.400]  well.
[01:45.400 --> 01:50.680]  Carbon taxes, you name it, and he said he will go after your handguns, not just your
[01:50.680 --> 01:51.680]  rifles.
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.840]  So he is openly saying things that I would expect to hear out of Fidel Castro's mouth,
[01:56.840 --> 02:02.560]  out of Joseph Stalin's mouth, out of Mao Zedong's mouth, out of Idi Amin's mouth, and you know,
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.240]  I think that's really what strikes me is that we know their puppets, but the globalists
[02:08.240 --> 02:12.880]  have moved us down the road now, where we're begging for somebody who supported abortion
[02:12.880 --> 02:21.520]  in the past, open borders, banning rifles, semi-autos, carbon taxes, wrote Obamacare,
[02:21.520 --> 02:26.360]  because he at least doesn't say small businesses didn't build anything, and at least now says
[02:26.360 --> 02:31.080]  he's anti-abortion and won't try to take all your guns.
[02:31.080 --> 02:35.480]  So I mean, Democrats wouldn't have gotten away with this 20 years ago posing as a Mitt
[02:35.480 --> 02:42.360]  Romney, and now the globalists have moved us so far down the road here, and close to
[02:42.360 --> 02:50.120]  half the public, dependent on government, that we are circling the black hole.
[02:50.120 --> 02:57.280]  Scientific tyranny is upon us, and it's just striking to hear a U.S. president saying you
[02:57.280 --> 02:59.760]  didn't build that.
[02:59.760 --> 03:06.520]  He is shocking to see the public so dumbed down that they don't even understand the basics
[03:06.520 --> 03:10.960]  of our system, they don't understand that government can't and won't deliver U.A.
[03:10.960 --> 03:16.760]  They're now seven days in to no power, three million people still, people ran out of food
[03:16.760 --> 03:21.080]  within a day, a dumpster diving, the public didn't know, even people that had money didn't
[03:21.080 --> 03:27.040]  know to go get food, they had like five, six days to get ready, and there's all these
[03:27.040 --> 03:32.480]  things on the news, people begging politicians for food and water and gasoline, and then
[03:32.480 --> 03:35.600]  of course the government can't deliver it to them.
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.720]  The police are out busy arresting people that dare have bows and arrows and baseball bats
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.600]  in their homes because you're not allowed to defend yourself.
[03:44.600 --> 03:49.000]  Some guy went and picked up gasoline in a neighboring state to bring back a bunch of
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.360]  containers of it to his friends and family, they arrested him.
[03:52.360 --> 03:57.920]  You see, if you try to help people, they're going to put you in jail.
[03:57.920 --> 04:01.240]  Domestication is the name of the game, but if you're stealing trillions of dollars, you're
[04:01.240 --> 04:06.480]  an offshore banking cartel, if you're the CIA and the UN caught running giant child
[04:06.480 --> 04:08.800]  kidnapping rings, you're not going to get in trouble.
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.760]  In fact, you know, you're still a little, they put you in prison, you're still a lot,
[04:12.760 --> 04:13.760]  they make you king.
[04:13.760 --> 04:17.600]  That's been said for thousands of years, different ways.
[04:17.600 --> 04:24.200]  It's been posthumously stated that this person or that said it, but it's just been well
[04:24.200 --> 04:26.520]  known for a long time.
[04:26.520 --> 04:30.040]  And we're now entering a hyper decadent cycle.
[04:30.040 --> 04:35.080]  This country will collapse and rot into a giant cesspit.
[04:35.080 --> 04:39.760]  The only question is, how long will it take and can we ever restore anything after we
[04:39.760 --> 04:40.760]  hit rock bottom?
[04:40.760 --> 04:43.760]  And governments dug in to make sure that doesn't happen.
[04:43.760 --> 04:48.400]  The collapse is meant to just destroy everything good and reduce everything down to pure evil.
[04:48.400 --> 04:50.080]  And that's the scientific program.
[04:50.080 --> 04:55.160]  The government is cancer and it's run by foreign banks that, well, for lack of a better term,
[04:55.160 --> 04:56.640]  I would dub Satan.
[04:56.640 --> 05:00.760]  We'll be back with all the big news.
[05:00.760 --> 05:06.680]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless
[05:06.680 --> 05:11.440]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.

[06:00.800 --> 06:07.760]  Our relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I
[06:07.760 --> 06:08.760]  safeguard.
[06:08.760 --> 06:13.640]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist
[06:13.640 --> 06:14.640]  threat.
[06:14.640 --> 06:17.080]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[06:17.080 --> 06:18.680]  They want that attack to come.
[06:18.680 --> 06:27.840]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.760]  We talk about natural disasters.
[06:29.760 --> 06:32.760]  The health environment, we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[06:32.760 --> 06:36.560]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even
[06:36.560 --> 06:40.600]  be ready and won't be able to get out of town because they'll be absolutely panicked.
[06:40.600 --> 06:43.360]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[06:43.360 --> 06:46.880]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[06:46.880 --> 06:51.400]  Strategic relocation film with Joel Scowzen and Alex Jones.

[06:59.600 --> 07:00.600]  Turn full in here.
[07:00.600 --> 07:05.160]  As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing
[07:05.160 --> 07:09.200]  access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home-crafted sources
[07:09.200 --> 07:12.120]  for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[07:12.120 --> 07:16.240]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.000]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.480]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological
[07:22.480 --> 07:26.320]  evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[07:26.320 --> 07:27.320]  culture.
[07:27.320 --> 07:32.680]  Today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India,
[07:32.680 --> 07:34.720]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[07:34.720 --> 07:35.840]  But here's some good news.
[07:35.840 --> 07:39.400]  South Reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented
[07:39.400 --> 07:42.120]  foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[07:42.120 --> 07:45.360]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[07:45.360 --> 07:50.240]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com, that's fermentationfactor.com.
[07:50.240 --> 07:56.440]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com.
[07:56.440 --> 08:12.240]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:12.240 --> 08:31.760]  7 or 11, snake eyes watching you.
[08:31.760 --> 08:40.400]  The ace of spades, the ace of spades, the only god the politicians need is the ace
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.120]  of spades.
[08:46.120 --> 08:50.160]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[08:50.160 --> 08:58.440]  It is Monday, November 5th, 2012, and I am your host, Alex Jones, Bev Harris, probably
[08:58.440 --> 09:04.080]  the leading expert, in fact hands down she is, when it comes to actually proving election
[09:04.080 --> 09:12.400]  fraud bipartisan across the board, nationwide, the HBO documentary, of course, Hacking Democracy,
[09:12.400 --> 09:17.240]  the last 15 years, she's gone from having 90 plus percent of people in major polls,
[09:17.240 --> 09:21.800]  seeing election fraud is impossible, to now I've seen polls of 8 out of 10 people saying
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.760]  they know there's massive election fraud taking place.
[09:25.760 --> 09:31.880]  The only question is exactly who is in control of it, as Stalin famously stated, the Russian
[09:31.880 --> 09:40.040]  dictator, who Obama's policies more and more mirror, very creepy, said it doesn't matter
[09:40.040 --> 09:45.560]  who cast the ballots, it matters who counts them, and so we're going to be looking at
[09:45.560 --> 09:46.560]  that today.
[09:46.560 --> 09:54.880]  Of course, they don't just rig elections to a great extent nationwide, there are some
[09:54.880 --> 10:02.280]  areas that have more transparent voting, but other areas that have been proven to be total
[10:02.280 --> 10:03.280]  frauds.
[10:03.280 --> 10:08.720]  No, they also control both of the candidates, obviously, there's a lot of different globalist
[10:08.720 --> 10:13.840]  special interests, but they're all linked up, pushing this global corporate unelected
[10:13.840 --> 10:21.040]  anti-free market, anti-family, post-industrial model of government, that I call basically
[10:21.040 --> 10:27.720]  the siege government or the total government, the authoritarian government 2.0, but we're
[10:27.720 --> 10:34.040]  going to be looking at every angle of this with Bev Harris with an update today, just
[10:34.040 --> 10:39.000]  for about 10, 15 minutes, then she'll be on with us about 30 minutes, obviously, tomorrow,
[10:39.000 --> 10:45.720]  on election day, November 6th, and then I think for an hour on Wednesday in the aftermath,
[10:45.720 --> 10:52.400]  and she always travels the country and has a lot of different sources out there that
[10:52.400 --> 10:56.400]  give her a very, very important information, so she's going to be joining us and we'll
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.240]  be on top of that situation with Bev Harris over the next three days.
[11:02.240 --> 11:08.120]  Also, you know I do info wars nightly news, 7 o'clock central, 8 o'clock eastern, 5 o'clock
[11:08.120 --> 11:14.000]  pacific, 6 o'clock mountain, every weeknight with my great crew of anchors and reporters
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.720]  here, and I will be hosting the news along with my reporters out in the field with live
[11:20.720 --> 11:29.320]  feeds getting a voter response out there on the streets of Austin, Texas, kind of a nice
[11:29.320 --> 11:33.720]  snap shot of the rest of the country, a very diverse eclectic city I live in, so we'll
[11:33.720 --> 11:40.720]  be having that tomorrow night from 5 to midnight and probably even longer, I'll do the three
[11:40.720 --> 11:46.280]  hour radio show and then I'll be back 5 to midnight central, and we're going to have
[11:46.280 --> 11:52.880]  Gerald Salente on Max Kaiser, Wayne Madsen, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Lou Rockwell, Nomi
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.960]  Prince, Webster Tarpley, and I'm going to try to call a Washington Times reporter, Joe
[11:57.960 --> 12:05.240]  Curl, get his take, we're also working on getting Colonel Schaefer on, who went on Fox
[12:05.240 --> 12:08.560]  News over the weekend and pointed out what Joel Scowson said last Friday and what's
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.080]  now been confirmed, they had drones overhead with live video feeds over the five hours
[12:14.080 --> 12:18.920]  of the ambassador being killed, and that was definitely a stand down, and I'm going to
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.440]  ask Tarpley about this, maybe even get Dr. Pachinicon, because I respect both these men,
[12:23.440 --> 12:27.680]  I think they have great minds, I think they legitimately say what they believe, but if
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.440]  they're saying it was a neocon hit on the ambassador, why didn't Obama send people
[12:33.440 --> 12:39.040]  in to defend him, I mean I understand a false flag to make Obama look bad like he couldn't
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.160]  protect this guy, but Al Qaeda was brought in by NATO and by the West, Obama says our
[12:44.160 --> 12:48.080]  military is under NATO control, that's in the executive order, it's in the whole force
[12:48.080 --> 12:53.720]  structure, just incredible things are happening in plain view, treason, and it's bipartisan,
[12:53.720 --> 12:59.160]  so I mean does that mean neocons are actually running the Obama administration and then
[12:59.160 --> 13:04.400]  they're blaming him with a coup from within, that just doesn't fly, the neocons are trying
[13:04.400 --> 13:10.880]  to knock down the door to get back in with their darling Mitt Romney, so we're going to
[13:10.880 --> 13:14.280]  get into that as well tomorrow night with those guests, we've also got some special
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.040]  guests joining us on the main radio show tomorrow, but there will be a free video, we're also
[13:19.040 --> 13:24.600]  going to send out over the audio feeds for everybody out there, not just video feeds,
[13:24.600 --> 13:28.720]  some people like to listen instead of watch, the main feeds at five o'clock will switch
[13:28.720 --> 13:37.240]  over from the rebroadcast of the radio show, retransmission of that, will switch over to
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.080]  the live coverage that we're going to have from five central past midnight, I have no
[13:42.080 --> 13:46.080]  doubt that I'll probably punch you out at midnight and if things are still going on
[13:46.080 --> 13:50.520]  it may be contested, they may postpone the election, they've got the board of elections
[13:50.520 --> 14:02.200]  in New York City in NBC and also in other publications CBS are reporting that the New York City
[14:02.200 --> 14:07.360]  Board of Elections, it's possible voting may be permitted beyond Tuesday, you've got large
[14:07.360 --> 14:11.800]  areas of the Jersey Shore that have declared martial law, in fact the town where they shot
[14:11.800 --> 14:17.360]  Jersey Shore says over the weekend calling it martial law, Aaron Dice wrote an article
[14:17.360 --> 14:22.240]  about that title Jersey Shore declares martial law, you got a couple million in Jersey and
[14:22.240 --> 14:26.080]  a couple million in New York without power and hundreds of thousands and a smattering
[14:26.080 --> 14:33.800]  of other states and they can't vote, they were saying that the marathon would go forward
[14:33.800 --> 14:38.120]  but government couldn't get that together and government is busy arresting people with
[14:38.120 --> 14:41.880]  baseball bats and bows and arrows in their homes and arresting people that drive to a
[14:41.880 --> 14:46.360]  nearby state to fill up a bunch of cans of gas to bring it to their neighbors and the
[14:46.360 --> 14:51.840]  police I have the article showed up and arrested the guy and said you know you're hoarding
[14:51.840 --> 14:59.080]  gas he's like they caught him quote at his house giving the gas to his neighbors, see
[14:59.080 --> 15:03.600]  in Katrina they blocked everybody getting out on the highways, you could walk out or
[15:03.600 --> 15:10.500]  drive out and then they even shot people and that came out and murdered people including
[15:10.500 --> 15:14.360]  a mentally retarded man who was walking out, I remember I first reported that because we
[15:14.360 --> 15:21.280]  had witnesses there who heard the shots and asked what happened and walked up to the checkpoint
[15:21.280 --> 15:26.400]  and they shot several people in that case but killed a mentally retarded man who just
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.760]  wanted food and water and wanted to walk out, you are to go to the super dome to be raped
[15:30.760 --> 15:37.880]  and die and again government could do a little better job helping people they don't want
[15:37.880 --> 15:45.160]  to they're there to dominate you when a government goes bad they put a culture of thugs in who
[15:45.160 --> 15:49.440]  cannot and will not help you and it's the same thing with Chuck E. Schumer going out
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.360]  with women on TV begging him for help we're freezing we're freezing we don't have any
[15:54.360 --> 15:59.000]  food we don't have any water and I was watching the video these are pretty nice houses these
[15:59.000 --> 16:03.720]  people are living in I could see mentally disabled whatever needing help that's who government
[16:03.720 --> 16:07.800]  is supposed to help by the way it's coming out in the news I have it here in my stack
[16:07.800 --> 16:13.080]  the churches are where everyone is congregating and organizing and it is the churches that
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.520]  people that did put food and water behind are going and donating part of what they've
[16:17.520 --> 16:24.600]  got and that's what's holding society together seven days into this the churches are the
[16:24.600 --> 16:28.280]  ones and the Red Cross as usual is taking the money and hoarding and will keep almost
[16:28.280 --> 16:34.880]  all of it that's what they do united ways same ball of acts salvation army is trying
[16:34.880 --> 16:39.560]  to help some people but government is there directing everything and they won't let you
[16:39.560 --> 16:45.400]  help them you have to go get directions from them and then they won't ever give you directions
[16:45.400 --> 16:49.520]  and so there are just generators and piles of food and water that's being reported I
[16:49.520 --> 16:58.440]  have it here in the stack as people beg for help and it is Katrina 2.0 it is Katrina 2.0
[16:58.440 --> 17:06.080]  right now Sandy is Katrina 2.0 Melissa Melton writing for info wars dot com threats to riot
[17:06.080 --> 17:11.480]  by Obama supporters reach crescendo I played these clips yesterday I'm going to play them
[17:11.480 --> 17:16.200]  again today back to back Michael Moore running videos saying burn down US cities of Obama
[17:16.200 --> 17:22.320]  not reelected and rip Romney's genitals off and then they go on to say in Spanish yes
[17:22.320 --> 17:27.880]  we can I mean this is organized calling and saying hey it's good to riot if your guy doesn't
[17:27.880 --> 17:33.280]  win we have a Bill Maher on HBO saying the same thing black people are going to hunt
[17:33.280 --> 17:39.720]  down whites and attack them if again they're selling the idea that it's racist if people
[17:39.720 --> 17:44.880]  vote for Romney and I'm not even a Romney supporter I know he's a globalist but when
[17:44.880 --> 17:51.600]  you watch the Democrats or the benchmark of going as low as they can go I mean it is incredible
[17:51.600 --> 17:58.400]  how they are pimping racial division and selling it because that's what they that's
[17:58.400 --> 18:05.200]  how they operate they they need to keep the old paradigm going because with young people
[18:05.200 --> 18:10.400]  folks I'm pretty young and I grew up when more modern times I mean I did not really
[18:10.400 --> 18:16.240]  ever see any type of racial stuff growing up in Dallas Texas I mean different groups
[18:16.240 --> 18:19.640]  of people didn't know each other would beat each other up two different groups of black
[18:19.640 --> 18:23.240]  guys would beat each other up white guys and black guys would get in a fight because they
[18:23.240 --> 18:27.960]  were just a different group of people different groups of Mexicans will get in fights with
[18:27.960 --> 18:31.480]  Mexicans different whites would get in fights with Mexicans I mean there was lots of that
[18:31.480 --> 18:35.960]  going on but it wasn't hey we're going to beat you up because you're white generally
[18:35.960 --> 18:39.360]  or we're going to beat you up because you're Mexican it was people were getting in fights
[18:39.360 --> 18:43.520]  if they didn't know I mean you go to a bonfire be a bunch of people in cowboy hats there and
[18:43.520 --> 18:47.440]  well who are you I don't know who you are you look just like me but I'm going to break
[18:47.440 --> 18:52.040]  your nose because I just feel like getting in a fight that kind of stuff went on but
[18:52.040 --> 18:57.880]  but but racial type stuff I never really ran into that and the issue here is is that you
[18:57.880 --> 19:03.840]  turn on MSNBC they are pushing it you don't like government health care you don't like
[19:03.840 --> 19:09.880]  socialism you're a racist and it is incredible what Paul Watson's put together threats for
[19:09.880 --> 19:14.960]  riot by Obama supporters reaches crescendo thousands of tweets on established tweets
[19:14.960 --> 19:19.520]  so many we can't even count them literally saying they're going to kill Romney they're
[19:19.520 --> 19:23.960]  going to do this and that racial type stuff and what do you expect when you got a white
[19:23.960 --> 19:31.960]  guy a poverty pimp a divide and conquer expert an abortion lover you've got a death lover
[19:31.960 --> 19:36.360]  like Bill Margits up and says hey white folks you vote for Romney black people know where
[19:36.360 --> 19:43.480]  you're at imagine that that level of garbage and and Michael Moore and all of them pimping
[19:43.480 --> 19:51.960]  racial division because that's how they control people unbelievable unbelievable so God forbid
[19:51.960 --> 19:58.280]  Obama not win tomorrow because if if if if there's an upset and Romney wins we're probably

[24:12.320 --> 24:21.520]  I know that the robber barons the British the Dutch royalty the Rothschilds funded eugenics
[24:21.520 --> 24:28.440]  funded Adolf Hitler funded Kaiser Wilhelm before that in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[24:28.440 --> 24:34.800]  I know the Democratic Party decided in about nineteen ten to stop being racist towards
[24:34.800 --> 24:40.120]  blacks and other minorities so they could get control of their communities and destroy
[24:40.120 --> 24:46.080]  their communities and break up their families and imprison them and abort their children
[24:46.080 --> 24:49.280]  because Margaret Singer wrote letters about it they're online they're public the scans
[24:49.280 --> 24:55.680]  of it they're in her university papers and so that's why when I watch MSNBC and I watch
[24:55.680 --> 24:59.900]  Bill Maher and he separately says I want more abortion more death I know he's talking
[24:59.900 --> 25:03.800]  about and then when he tries to play whites and blacks off against each other I know what
[25:03.800 --> 25:09.440]  he's doing he is dividing and conquering and let me tell you something folks if my children
[25:09.440 --> 25:13.640]  are going to be free your children have got to be free no matter what color they are and
[25:13.640 --> 25:20.080]  I want you to be free I want you to be wealthy and successful and dynamic and I want our
[25:20.080 --> 25:27.760]  progeny to colonize the stars together because we are humankind together and I am so sick
[25:27.760 --> 25:37.880]  of the racist social engineering vicious Democratic Party waging unmitigated hellish war against
[25:37.880 --> 25:45.120]  minorities who sit there dumb down just like the moron Democrat white people and who sit
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.720]  there while they're being exterminated and dumbed down and domesticated and then you
[25:48.720 --> 25:54.480]  got the Republicans who on average are a little more informed a little more successful they
[25:54.480 --> 25:59.640]  at least know that free markets better and that small businesses are better and that
[25:59.640 --> 26:05.400]  government can't and won't deliver and that there is no free lunch but they hate the Democrats
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.200]  so much they can't figure out the Republicans are totally bought and paid for by the same
[26:10.200 --> 26:16.360]  group and are just there to play the part of the opposition by the way Mitt Romney does
[26:16.360 --> 26:23.520]  plan on trying to stir up war with Russia and others when he gets elected Obama's been
[26:23.520 --> 26:28.480]  doing the same thing he just puts out all this pro-Russia rhetoric you will get the
[26:28.480 --> 26:33.280]  neocons who like to run around openly threatening people if Mitt Romney gets in I'm not hoping
[26:33.280 --> 26:38.880]  Mitt Romney gets in I'm going to tell you something though intellectually at a gut level
[26:38.880 --> 26:48.600]  and it wasn't like this even a year ago I know and I fear that things are going to accelerate
[26:48.600 --> 26:55.320]  really bad under Obama and that's all I can say and maybe that's a good thing because
[26:55.320 --> 27:01.040]  you know Romney in every poll every national poll and in all the major swing states was
[27:01.040 --> 27:05.840]  had come to a dead heat or was three to five points six points and some ahead of Obama
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.400]  and the hurricane hit and I told you that it would let him grandstand get the surge
[27:11.400 --> 27:16.120]  out of the news get Benghazi out of the news the Benghazi cover up which is now confirmed
[27:16.120 --> 27:24.360]  that they had live video feeds of it and stood down for five hours that's confirmed I said
[27:24.360 --> 27:29.760]  and not a rocket scientist here I said this if anything gets Obama in this is yet along
[27:29.760 --> 27:33.600]  with election fraud but both sides do it so it's whoever can control the most machines
[27:33.600 --> 27:38.160]  and engage in the most cheating and who knows when everything so corrupted it's just it's
[27:38.160 --> 27:43.720]  like a hall of mirrors with a smoke machine going you know with the ceiling turned upside
[27:43.720 --> 27:49.200]  down I mean on a roller coaster all I know is we got a bunch of crooks running things
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.800]  and we can rearrange deck chairs on the Titanic all day long and see I desperately I'm just
[27:55.800 --> 28:00.120]  like everybody else I hoped Obama I didn't support him because I wasn't stupid but I
[28:00.120 --> 28:03.880]  said I hope Obama lives up to his promises four years ago but I said his advisors are
[28:03.880 --> 28:09.040]  all globalist he's going to break every promise and he did except for giving you socialist
[28:09.040 --> 28:12.920]  health care and that's not even socialist it's written by the big mega banks that own
[28:12.920 --> 28:16.320]  the insurance company so I guess it was a fraud too but he at least delivered on the
[28:16.320 --> 28:21.720]  surface with that and he got in and it was just as bad as I thought it would be exactly
[28:21.720 --> 28:25.280]  what I said would happen happen because I know the agenda and I'm here even though I'm
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.840]  not supporting Romney or Obama I've got to say well at least Romney says he's anti abortion
[28:29.840 --> 28:35.320]  at least he says he won't try to ban handguns and rifles as Obama has said and then I feel
[28:35.320 --> 28:40.080]  immoral for not endorsing and pushing Romney because I go well what happens if Obama gets
[28:40.080 --> 28:44.320]  in and totally takes over and it's ten times worse and isn't facing reelection and then
[28:44.320 --> 28:47.920]  it really gets babbled I wish later but you know what it's just all evil and that's the
[28:47.920 --> 28:54.080]  way it is and we as a nation are being judged here and I'm normally very decisive but when
[28:54.080 --> 28:58.400]  you're rearranging deck chairs in the Titanic the reason I can't figure out what's better
[28:58.400 --> 29:05.720]  in my mind of the two is because the whole ship is sinking and that's why I can't figure
[29:05.720 --> 29:10.720]  out which one I want to support because it's the left right paradigm like never before
[29:10.720 --> 29:16.400]  right there in front of us I just look at how authoritarian the Democrats are and how
[29:16.400 --> 29:22.720]  they're pushing race baiting everywhere it is despicable while saying they're the anti
[29:22.720 --> 29:31.240]  racist it's it's so frustrating I'm so tired of it we're gonna get into the just the collapse
[29:31.240 --> 29:36.080]  that's happening in the northeast of New York New Jersey government as usual is not helping
[29:36.080 --> 29:40.400]  anyone doing a horrible job going out and arresting people that try to help their neighbors
[29:40.400 --> 29:45.720]  we're gonna get into the calls for rioting if Obama loses that are intensifying big article

[34:13.040 --> 34:19.320]  with the system whoever controls them depending on the case of senator hagel and nebraska
[34:19.320 --> 34:23.240]  ninety plus percent of the votes for him cast on machines he owned or whether it's hard
[34:23.240 --> 34:29.200]  inter civics predominantly controlled by the romney family and one of romney's sons controlling
[34:29.200 --> 34:33.360]  a large portion of the votes or democratic connected groups controlling large swaths
[34:33.360 --> 34:39.320]  of the country that use different machines it is really unprecedented that this is right
[34:39.320 --> 34:43.840]  in our face what Stalin said i don't care who votes i care who counts the ballots to
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.960]  preface his famous quote so we stand here at the threshold and i remember ten twelve
[34:49.960 --> 34:53.480]  years ago interviewing bev harris and remember interviewing the collier brothers before they
[34:53.480 --> 34:56.840]  died i remember interviewing their daughter i remember interviewing all the different
[34:56.840 --> 35:02.200]  election fraud specialists but bev harris is preeminent amongst them because of her
[35:02.200 --> 35:08.240]  tireless work and her history as a corporate fraud investigator that now most people have
[35:08.240 --> 35:12.440]  seen national polls eighty to ninety plus percent of ping on which one said they know
[35:12.440 --> 35:17.560]  there's problems with voting in this country my issue is the u n is so corrupt with what
[35:17.560 --> 35:21.080]  they do overthrowing countries and things that i don't think you can have satan come
[35:21.080 --> 35:26.240]  judge b lz bob or lucifer and you know uh... you know the pot can't expose the kettle
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.360]  here basically out of the frying pan into the fire uh... but the u n is running around
[35:31.360 --> 35:36.000]  as well people out in california being fired of uh... from the elections if they complain
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.720]  about it uh... in several states like texas they're saying they're gonna arrest you and
[35:39.720 --> 35:44.440]  monitors i think it's fine as long as they're not in the polling place itself but see they're
[35:44.440 --> 35:49.840]  not going after the machines they're going after you know people not being able to vote
[35:49.840 --> 35:53.720]  repeatedly so it's that classic socialist mode but bev harris is an american writer
[35:53.720 --> 35:58.560]  activist and founder of black box voting in uh... national nonpartisan non-profit educational
[35:58.560 --> 36:03.640]  watchdog group she helped to popularize the term black box voting while authoring the
[36:03.640 --> 36:08.000]  book of the same title and two thousand and three she discovered the source code for voting
[36:08.000 --> 36:12.040]  manufacturer diable election systems which operates under the name premiere election
[36:12.040 --> 36:15.920]  systems and she proved it was designed to go in and flip it and cover it up
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.600]  oh yeah it's really nice after examining these files harris wrote an article in july
[36:20.600 --> 36:24.120]  of a two thousand three detailing how to bypass passwords
[36:24.120 --> 36:25.680]  manipulate election results
[36:25.680 --> 36:27.280]  on the diable jim's
[36:27.280 --> 36:28.840]  central tally system
[36:28.840 --> 36:31.080]  and of course they made a uh...
[36:31.080 --> 36:33.640]  blockbuster film error hb o
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.920]  and hacking democracy with her uh... and harris also follow whistleblower lawsuit alleging
[36:38.920 --> 36:42.760]  that diable election systems had made false claims when selling their system to alameda
[36:42.760 --> 36:44.000]  county california
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.680]  diable pay the state of california two point six million
[36:46.680 --> 36:50.160]  settle the case black box voting dot or or is her site
[36:50.160 --> 36:53.680]  uh... bev we're going to keep you about ten fifteen minutes i know you're a busy lady
[36:53.680 --> 36:56.800]  you're gonna pop in tomorrow and then longer on wednesday
[36:56.800 --> 36:59.880]  uh... and then maybe even thursday once we learn of what's happened it's not a question
[36:59.880 --> 37:01.240]  of will there be fraud
[37:01.240 --> 37:04.360]  uh... the only question is how much of it will we discover that harris what are you
[37:04.360 --> 37:07.240]  seeing since we talked last week developing
[37:07.240 --> 37:11.720]  well one thing i'm saying is a really big effort to focus people's attention away from
[37:11.720 --> 37:13.080]  the insider
[37:13.080 --> 37:17.440]  uh... you know we're starting to see all of it some guy came out and claimed on the
[37:17.440 --> 37:20.480]  internet that he had voted four times in north carolina
[37:20.480 --> 37:22.680]  understand what that is
[37:22.680 --> 37:24.440]  that is an attempt
[37:24.440 --> 37:25.640]  to focus here
[37:25.640 --> 37:30.000]  after your eyes away from the insiders and instead put them on
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.480]  outsiders
[37:31.480 --> 37:36.000]  the problem isn't outsiders coming in to commit fraud the problem is happening on
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.280]  the inside
[37:37.280 --> 37:40.240]  and you know you mentioned we've made a lot of progress
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.680]  with public awareness we really have
[37:42.680 --> 37:47.280]  and i think now they know that the public knows there's something wrong so
[37:47.280 --> 37:50.960]  they're so they're going well what do we do next let's focus their attention on
[37:50.960 --> 37:52.240]  the outside game
[37:52.240 --> 37:54.480]  no that we have to
[37:54.480 --> 37:59.640]  pay attention to where it's happening and that's the people with inside access
[37:59.640 --> 38:01.680]  and i guess they call that comptroller
[38:01.680 --> 38:05.160]  uh... style fraud that's always the biggest threat just like we saw
[38:05.160 --> 38:08.800]  uh... john corzine ordering billions of dollars disappear
[38:08.800 --> 38:10.280]  right right i mean
[38:10.280 --> 38:12.200]  if you look at bank robbery
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.480]  although it's always in the papers about you know guy with a mask who comes in
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.000]  with a gun to rob the bank
[38:19.000 --> 38:19.080]  most
[38:19.080 --> 38:24.320]  staff from banks happens from the inside from their own accounting
[38:24.320 --> 38:25.280]  inside
[38:25.280 --> 38:30.560]  fraud is out numbers outside fraud probably in elections you know a hundred
[38:30.560 --> 38:32.160]  thousand to one
[38:32.160 --> 38:35.120]  sir sir you're saying retail fraud
[38:35.120 --> 38:40.160]  uh... is always the distraction when it's the centralized fraud and the fact
[38:40.160 --> 38:41.960]  that the integrity of the system
[38:41.960 --> 38:45.640]  is a proven scam that's the big kahuna
[38:45.640 --> 38:48.000]  right and we have to get
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.800]  still a little bit better at detecting
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.240]  uh... at getting our bs-seeder to perform better because the idea that
[38:57.240 --> 39:01.520]  we're watching you know if you're seeing it all over national tv
[39:01.520 --> 39:07.240]  uh... somebody is allowing it to get to national tv
[39:07.240 --> 39:09.280]  that's right they fight tooth and nail
[39:09.280 --> 39:12.800]  to suppress for decades the electronic voting machine fraud that you and
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.160]  others have forced out in the open but they never want to cover that
[39:17.160 --> 39:20.280]  and just a quick
[39:20.280 --> 39:24.360]  correction i guess although it's actually a difference without a difference
[39:24.360 --> 39:28.480]  uh... the romney family itself doesn't have controlling interest in heart
[39:28.480 --> 39:30.080]  interstitial
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.520]  but i think it's not a difference though what it is it's a big capital
[39:33.520 --> 39:34.440]  spinoff
[39:34.440 --> 39:39.160]  that has controlling interest and so you know you go to a couple of hoops
[39:39.160 --> 39:41.960]  before you find any romney fair
[39:41.960 --> 39:45.600]  and so they're a you know and immediately if the story came out in the
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.840]  irish is all nothing to see here the romney's aren't involved
[39:49.840 --> 39:53.800]  deflecting our attention from the fact that this is a bane spinoff
[39:53.800 --> 39:56.280]  who is associated with bane
[39:56.280 --> 39:57.320]  romney
[39:57.320 --> 40:02.000]  and so we we start seeing it and what's amazing is we see these outlets like
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.960]  npr saying not only is romney himself not involved
[40:06.960 --> 40:11.000]  not to worry even if he was there's no problem
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.480]  but i don't know who they have who do they bring on to tell us that that's
[40:15.480 --> 40:19.680]  the truth an election official who says of course nobody could cover with
[40:19.680 --> 40:23.480]  my machine you know it it's just
[40:23.480 --> 40:27.720]  silly that you have the democrats and the republicans defending
[40:27.720 --> 40:31.960]  uh... proven a fraudulent system and right again uh...
[40:31.960 --> 40:36.200]  i mean i've got a couple of subsidiary companies but they're still under my
[40:36.200 --> 40:38.560]  control and to sit there and say
[40:38.560 --> 40:41.520]  all well uh... you know it's a subsidiary
[40:41.520 --> 40:44.440]  uh... so it's not a conflict of interest that's kind of like romney saying
[40:44.440 --> 40:47.040]  i have these blind trust
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.360]  uh... and they're not really blind trust and uh... because they're still in
[40:50.360 --> 40:51.720]  there manipulating
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.000]  right so i you know i think we're getting closer though alex to getting
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  the public to the tipping point and so now we're seeing uh... these games of
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.080]  diversion
[41:01.080 --> 41:05.400]  but they're really uh... even those aren't really working all that well and
[41:05.400 --> 41:07.120]  you know i've told some people
[41:07.120 --> 41:08.280]  look if
[41:08.280 --> 41:11.560]  if romney does win which
[41:11.560 --> 41:13.040]  very probable to me
[41:13.040 --> 41:14.800]  but if he does win
[41:14.800 --> 41:16.320]  then uh...
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.280]  he better do poorly on the heart machine because no amount of denial is
[41:20.280 --> 41:24.880]  going to take people's attention off those heart machines
[41:24.880 --> 41:28.320]  you're right let's talk about that because uh... uh... i mean i see it
[41:28.320 --> 41:31.080]  kind of like one is cyanide one is arsenic
[41:31.080 --> 41:34.280]  both of them are poisonous both of them are lethal doses
[41:34.280 --> 41:36.280]  they work for the same globalist
[41:36.280 --> 41:38.960]  uh... but there are going to be some differences
[41:38.960 --> 41:42.000]  i mean i don't like the fact that obama openly says he's going to go after
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.520]  handguns and rifles
[41:43.520 --> 41:47.960]  you've got romney saying he wants to you know expand big wars i don't like that
[41:47.960 --> 41:50.000]  i mean it's kind of like pick your poison
[41:50.000 --> 41:54.680]  uh... but i do see michael more calling for violence if uh...
[41:54.680 --> 41:58.280]  obama is not elected saying that well if he's not elected it's fraud
[41:58.280 --> 41:59.960]  uh... i see
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.520]  uh... bill marr stirring up uh... divide and conquer really saying some
[42:03.520 --> 42:04.640]  horrible things
[42:04.640 --> 42:07.720]  what do you think is going on behind that because you and i that are
[42:07.720 --> 42:10.480]  you know old school hands of the world studying this
[42:10.480 --> 42:13.960]  they wouldn't let them you know go out and put this out in the media
[42:13.960 --> 42:17.320]  if they weren't being given some type of okay from up top so
[42:17.320 --> 42:20.920]  uh... what do you think the strategies are on both sides from these groups and
[42:20.920 --> 42:24.200]  i really respect your view why do you think it's going to be romney when the
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.400]  mainstream media saying it's going to be obama
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.320]  uh...
[42:28.320 --> 42:32.080]  well what i want to try i think it's going to be romney and by the way that
[42:32.080 --> 42:35.320]  doesn't have anything to do with who really voted for who that just has to do
[42:35.320 --> 42:38.200]  with who the chosen winner will be
[42:38.200 --> 42:41.200]  and what i watch right before the election it's when they
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.200]  send out uh... things all over the mainstream media to create possibility
[42:46.200 --> 42:49.840]  and especially when they send out implausible things to create possibility
[42:49.840 --> 42:53.640]  uh... let me give you an example in two thousand eight in new hampshire in the
[42:53.640 --> 42:54.600]  primary
[42:54.600 --> 42:59.520]  we saw this happen with hillary clinton now she had just lost the iowa caucus
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.120]  and she came out and said and they said well
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.200]  you know hillary was eighteen points behind but she's caught up now because
[43:07.200 --> 43:11.280]  she cried and that made all the women decided to vote for hillary
[43:11.280 --> 43:16.680]  that's what i call implausibly trying to develop a veneer of plausibility
[43:16.680 --> 43:20.160]  well i've been seeing a lot of that in terms of the romney thing where they're
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.480]  trotting out polls that are from these companies that use a known bias in their
[43:24.480 --> 43:25.880]  sampling method
[43:25.880 --> 43:29.720]  and then they're ignoring some of the other polls
[43:29.720 --> 43:34.080]  if they're working so hard to create plausibility then it makes me think that
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.800]  they need that plausibility for some reason i.e. they plan to create a
[43:38.800 --> 43:40.080]  result that they need positive
[43:40.080 --> 43:44.080]  sure bev i agree with you to a point but we see both sides doing this
[43:44.080 --> 43:44.960]  you know having the
[43:44.960 --> 43:48.040]  having the bookies come out in europe in the u.s. and say
[43:48.040 --> 43:51.840]  you know uh... seventy plus percent chance that it's going to be
[43:51.840 --> 43:57.480]  uh... obama or all the polls that were showing romney winning by three to five
[43:57.480 --> 44:00.840]  points suddenly show it neck and neck or obama winning
[44:00.840 --> 44:05.160]  uh... and i see i've missed that i've been watching the other flip so who knows
[44:05.160 --> 44:05.920]  now
[44:05.920 --> 44:11.080]  uh... yeah well then maybe not you know i'm i'm gonna find out tomorrow
[44:11.080 --> 44:14.720]  uh... predicting winners by the way i should tell you that
[44:14.720 --> 44:16.520]  well that let me just add this
[44:16.520 --> 44:19.680]  when it's all a smoke screen and fraud with both sides
[44:19.680 --> 44:24.080]  who could know i i mean it's gotten so corrupt maybe they don't even know it's
[44:24.080 --> 44:25.840]  whoever can snatch the most
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.120]  uh... you know control the most machines
[44:28.120 --> 44:31.960]  well yeah there's no way regardless of who wins there's absolutely no reason
[44:31.960 --> 44:33.200]  to have confidence in it
[44:33.200 --> 44:37.000]  and there's also no reason to commit violence but guess what that's not
[44:37.000 --> 44:38.800]  going to get us any farther
[44:38.800 --> 44:41.960]  any more than you know you see a bunch of people marching around marching
[44:41.960 --> 44:44.840]  around in the street with signs that is that doesn't work that worked in the
[44:44.840 --> 44:46.600]  sixties it doesn't work now
[44:46.600 --> 44:50.280]  you know we're really looking at at this point we need to expose the fraud and
[44:50.280 --> 44:53.840]  we need to do litigation and hope that we get a good judge you remember with the
[44:53.840 --> 44:55.520]  tobacco litigation
[44:55.520 --> 44:59.720]  they eventually won after losing a lot of battle because they just kept
[44:59.720 --> 45:04.000]  throwing it against the wall until they got a judge that found their way
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.920]  well that's like George Washington lost almost every battle but never gave up so
[45:07.920 --> 45:09.240]  they finally won
[45:09.240 --> 45:11.720]  i mean it's whoever wants it the most
[45:11.720 --> 45:13.400]  yeah exactly and
[45:13.400 --> 45:17.840]  and we see this when we see them you know pushing in for example internet
[45:17.840 --> 45:20.240]  voting which is like the worst of all worlds
[45:20.240 --> 45:24.520]  and every time it gets defeated by citizens coming up to the legislator and
[45:24.520 --> 45:28.200]  testifying against it it comes right back the next year with its corporate
[45:28.200 --> 45:31.400]  sponsors well we gotta do the same thing if we want that
[45:31.400 --> 45:36.360]  if we want public sovereignty if we want public control of our own government
[45:36.360 --> 45:40.840]  we can't just give up after losing one fight this is not something and i tell
[45:40.840 --> 45:43.240]  people we're going to get off the treadmill you know it's not something
[45:43.240 --> 45:47.480]  just about one election it's about restoring our freedom
[45:47.480 --> 45:51.560]  that's right we get 60 turnouts on average for these big presidential
[45:51.560 --> 45:53.000]  elections are close to it
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.600]  and you get what eight and a half or so no what's the average last time i checked
[45:56.600 --> 45:57.800]  8.6
[45:57.800 --> 46:01.720]  local turnout we need people to take over their local
[46:01.720 --> 46:04.840]  towns and cities yes we need people to take over the
[46:04.840 --> 46:08.520]  the states that's where the rubber meets the road not just every four years
[46:08.520 --> 46:11.080]  wake up for a few months and then go back to sleep
[46:11.080 --> 46:14.280]  and the same thing goes with that you're going to litigate about election
[46:14.280 --> 46:18.680]  getting them back in the open pick a small issue oriented thing that happens
[46:18.680 --> 46:21.480]  locally because there's not going to be as much
[46:21.480 --> 46:26.120]  dollars behind defending that and all you have to do is win the principle it
[46:26.120 --> 46:29.720]  doesn't matter which race you win the principle with
[46:29.720 --> 46:32.120]  now i know in the past one of the final questions we've got them we'll get a
[46:32.120 --> 46:34.040]  bigger update from you on election day and then on
[46:34.040 --> 46:36.440]  wednesday in the aftermath obviously that's what's going to be really
[46:36.440 --> 46:38.280]  important is what happens in the aftermath with
[46:38.280 --> 46:42.440]  bev harris the black box voting dot org now now i've studied this quite a bit
[46:42.440 --> 46:45.080]  but but break it down as simply as you could in a few minutes like you were
[46:45.080 --> 46:49.640]  talking to you know say as cnn audience
[46:49.640 --> 46:54.040]  how does the election work when when when when you see them come out and act
[46:54.040 --> 46:57.480]  like they've all gotten the numbers first i know it was voter news services
[46:57.480 --> 47:00.360]  in the past because it's not just regional fraud
[47:00.360 --> 47:04.200]  i know we've seen chicanery up at the national level when they integrate
[47:04.200 --> 47:06.520]  that what's the company called now it's called
[47:06.520 --> 47:10.600]  any p national election for the same guys as a voter news service they just
[47:10.600 --> 47:14.280]  changed their name and essentially when you were
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.120]  watching cnn in your channel surfing from channel to channel and they're all
[47:18.120 --> 47:22.040]  pretending that they are they have their own analysts and they're going to tell
[47:22.040 --> 47:24.040]  you it's not and they don't have different
[47:24.040 --> 47:28.920]  analysts they're all using any p they all pay any p they have one analyst one
[47:28.920 --> 47:32.280]  set of analysts and they all repeat the same numbers and pretend that they're
[47:32.280 --> 47:35.640]  having a horse race for who can get the results first
[47:35.640 --> 47:39.720]  and what's so interesting is any p this year is decided it's not going to exit
[47:39.720 --> 47:44.280]  poll 19 states so i i just i tell you i really am i'm going to watch tv tomorrow
[47:44.280 --> 47:48.520]  night with a stopwatch and see how quickly they call the states where they
[47:48.520 --> 47:52.840]  happen to have canceled the exit poll unbelievable uh what's your
[47:52.840 --> 47:56.280]  intel on what cbs news and others are reporting that the new york
[47:56.280 --> 48:01.640]  board of elections is saying they may allow voting past tuesday what what in
[48:01.640 --> 48:06.360]  the world is that going to do not just that they also said people can fax in
[48:06.360 --> 48:10.680]  their vote they can email it in and they're blaming it on the storm but
[48:10.680 --> 48:14.600]  what here's what i don't understand in the help america vote act one of the
[48:14.600 --> 48:17.960]  things that they required was a disaster plan because of course it can happen if
[48:17.960 --> 48:21.400]  you're going to depend on electronics and the electricity goes out you need to
[48:21.400 --> 48:24.040]  have a backup plan they have backup plans
[48:24.040 --> 48:29.480]  so i also am a little confused by that too though because
[48:29.480 --> 48:34.920]  they say that new york and new jersey are not particularly swing states so i
[48:34.920 --> 48:38.440]  don't know if that might be aimed at the house or
[48:38.440 --> 48:41.800]  something like that you know we've got some close
[48:41.800 --> 48:46.520]  races in the house and the senate on both fronts but i mean that gives the
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.000]  lawyers more time to start stuff up yeah that gives uh companies longer to
[48:51.000 --> 48:55.640]  find extra votes tweak things uh that's not a good sign though probably if they
[48:55.640 --> 48:59.240]  keep the election results out there for a couple days
[48:59.240 --> 49:03.320]  well you think that's bad try california they keep counting the votes three
[49:03.320 --> 49:07.080]  weeks after the election i'm not kidding you
[49:07.080 --> 49:10.200]  this is the state the thing down california they start counting the
[49:10.200 --> 49:14.200]  absentee votes which is about 50 percent of the votes in california
[49:14.200 --> 49:17.320]  three weeks before the election so they pretty much know what they meet on
[49:17.320 --> 49:20.360]  election day and they keep counting these straggler
[49:20.360 --> 49:25.080]  votes all the way up for another three weeks it's it's crazy to keep doing
[49:25.080 --> 49:28.360]  unbelievable we've got a minute left you're back with us tomorrow any other
[49:28.360 --> 49:31.240]  tidbits you'd like to relate to the audience
[49:31.240 --> 49:36.200]  um i i think we're just going to have to watch and see which way the wind blows
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.760]  and then the real work starts to unravel and find out how it happened
[49:40.760 --> 49:43.560]  uh regardless of who wins it doesn't really matter
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.840]  we have to unravel it and prove uh at least find one or two locations that
[49:48.840 --> 49:51.880]  will make good tests either lawsuits or uh fraud
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.400]  investigations because we've got to get the integrity of the system back if
[49:55.400 --> 49:58.760]  we're ever going to get out of this mess right it's a structural problem and so
[49:58.760 --> 50:01.800]  we have to tackle probably going to have the best luck tackling that at the
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.360]  local level or in one uh defined situation and then
[50:06.360 --> 50:10.360]  expanding the principle out beyond that after we win a smaller one
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.520]  folks if you want to make real change go to blackbox voting.org and donate
[50:14.520 --> 50:17.800]  support this lady she's going to be out there in the days and weeks after
[50:17.800 --> 50:20.920]  we'll get updates from her as she ferrets out more corruption
[50:20.920 --> 50:25.560]  uh she is absolutely like a pit bull uh expose these guys over and over again
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.360]  Bev Harris we'll talk to you again tomorrow thanks Alex
[50:28.360 --> 50:31.240]  there goes Bev Harris we're going to go to break we're going to come back i'm

[50:33.720 --> 50:36.760]  to be going over and then it's going to be open phones
[50:36.760 --> 50:40.040]  open phones throughout the next two hours here today
[50:40.040 --> 50:43.080]  uh it's the day before the 2012 presidential election
[50:43.080 --> 50:47.080]  it's November 5th and uh i quite frankly just want to get this thing over
[50:47.080 --> 50:50.760]  with because it becomes a big distraction while they're busy having the
[50:50.760 --> 50:53.160]  court's rule there's no fourth amendment
[50:53.160 --> 50:56.520]  while they're busy you know coming after our freedoms the republicans and
[50:56.520 --> 51:00.360]  democrats are both the problem we'll be right back

[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.840]  people saying this and i've actually had black people
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.720]  tell me this repeatedly i've had white people saying about
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.960]  blah i i it's so sick that the left is not the
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.200]  left at all they are a bunch of monsters uh they are a bunch of
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.000]  of the pie is one size we want socialism we want to pull everybody down
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.600]  and we want to abort people he was just showing me this footage
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.320]  well maybe so mad about it as i saw it weeks ago and didn't even play it on
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.600]  air because it's so horrible we're going to bleep that out and then tie it in
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.480]  with the other uh doctor saying you know we we're gonna
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.000]  abort all the ugly black babies and i'm not trying to just get off into this
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.400]  all day i just every time i'm around the so-called
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.440]  left all they talk about is killing babies and how great it is
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.320]  and how they love death i mean i can play bill marr saying he loves death
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.000]  because they're eugenicists and even their minions are eugenicists
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.320]  the victims of it sit around getting into it and i guess it's the old thing if
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.080]  you can't beat them join them i for one have had enough of these people
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.200]  and it and then i wish there was an alternative and met romney
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.880]  but i'm not dumb enough to sit there and be suckered by it but still at a
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.560]  subconscious level you want to hit the reset button come on change
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.760]  something i hope obama changes at all he did what i thought he do
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:07.560]  come on romney change it change it but he won't
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.960]  because we've gotten lazy and we've let corrupt people run everything
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.720]  tommy uh from friday we got his number and called him back if we can get to him
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.480]  on air he's in new york man seven days without power in many areas
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.360]  how are you faring what can you tell us um i'm actually pretty good i have a
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.400]  couple locations uh i was down in the east village where
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.520]  that power plant blew up i don't know if you saw the video online
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.160]  i'm not like three or four blocks away from that
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.080]  and wow it was it was really really really really crazy i mean
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.240]  the east river the ocean was coming right down avenue c and avenue d
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.360]  um people did not leave their homes people were not prepared
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:49.160]  and they all got flooded out um so i mean that that's it's it was definitely
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.040]  definitely shocking to see that in the place that you know people were not
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.720]  expecting it have you seen the reports of police
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.960]  arresting people trying to defend their homes and
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.000]  arresting people to try to bring gasoline to their neighbors
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.880]  yeah i've seen those reports and actually i want to speak on that too like

[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.280]  subscriber and i expected an exercise of martial law that was the first thing i
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.480]  thought was going to happen and at first it seemed that way because uh they put
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.560]  in bridge restrictions and um there was the gas shortages and
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.680]  they they closed up the port you know what you know what i want to hear this

[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.960]  disaster that is sandy and the government response that's a big part of
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:59.880]  the disaster chat in new york and others we are
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.280]  going to get to everybody here today and we are also going to
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.880]  continue breaking down a little spoof video
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.080]  that i put out last night that 15 seconds into it i explained it is a spoof
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.440]  i see my it guys running around yeah it's weird every once in a while i get
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:22.840]  right up on the microphone like that it creates like a
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.400]  thing after it and that's what happened with another
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.640]  uh noamen microphone of this same design years ago remember that
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.400]  just a little technical stuff most people probably can't hear it but it's uh
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.160]  it's uh very strange uh continuing i called the video
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:43.400]  breaking mit romney elected 45th president
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.560]  and then i go on to say uh no he hasn't been but then i show democrats
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.600]  with just hundreds of articles out there saying
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.600]  uh obama's gonna win landslide there's no way he can lose 85 new york times
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.720]  with their little push poll uh you know the bookies in europe and
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:08.440]  england and ireland and the us are already paying out on obama
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.120]  and my point is is that's the attempt to create a foregone conclusion
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:17.000]  and the only reason i tend to get even more concerned about four years of
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.960]  obama is because he's not facing a reelection
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:24.520]  he'll have the power of the pardon he'll have the power
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.680]  uh of the executive order unbridled which he's shown he'll do more than any
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.480]  other president and i'm not naive i know it's because we're further down the
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.680]  rat hole now in the new world order that's why each president gets worse
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.960]  in the last but i hoped obama would turn out to be
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.280]  good i didn't support him i didn't support john mccain
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.560]  i knew john mccain was throwing that election i knew that was the equivalent
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.680]  of a don king boxing match as funny as the three dollar bill
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.960]  and i said that at the time uh joe ferrer wrote that at the time for world net
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.840]  daily saying you know none of the above wrote a book called that
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.000]  but with this obama thing i mean saying small businesses didn't build it
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.880]  that they're gonna shut down the coal power plants that they're gonna take the
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.320]  handguns and rifles i mean even though i know romney's
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.040]  bad man when obama is saying he's coming for my guns
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.280]  when obama is saying he's gonna put the military completely under the u and
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.480]  a nato uh me and my wife have sat around my wife was
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:19.400]  this morning and and you know she's somebody raised a democrat
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.240]  uh you know she's been a patriot for about 15 16 years since i woke her up
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.840]  smart lady but she's sitting there going man i i want to leave the country
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.440]  if obama gets reelected i'm telling you because you know we have those discussions
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.960]  every day do we get out of here and it's like well we don't
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.680]  i mean where are we going to go every everywhere is under the new world order
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.680]  and they're making laws even we're post tax money you can't get it out of the
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.960]  country i mean they don't want to folks this
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.400]  country is going into tyranny and i and i just said well look it's going to be
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.360]  bad if romney gets into and we got to just stand and fight
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.560]  but i mean it's down to around my breakfast table
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:12:02.040]  at 7 a.m while drinking a cup of joe with my wife every day
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.360]  every day i'm having to say no no we're gonna stay
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.800]  and you know what even if they end up rounding us up and putting us in prison
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.920]  or killing us i mean i i i i guess you can call it a
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.040]  wrong decision but i don't think it's a wrong decision to stay
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.120]  and speak out against this but i want listeners to understand this is not a
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.600]  game i'm not saying this for hyperbole okay
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.680]  uh you know my wife's got a degree in history and english
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:33.480]  uh she got a special degree via ut in normandy france
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.080]  i have been a history buff i've studied geopolitical systems
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.600]  and i've interviewed scores of constitutional lawyers
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.200]  and historians from across the political spectrum who say yes we're going
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:52.360]  into hot dangerous evil tyranny and a lot of people say well then i'm
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.800]  just going to cower and try to go along with the system no no no no no
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.000]  historically that is what will get us destroyed
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.120]  that's like if you see a grizzly bear walking along uh at yellowstone park
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:09.320]  and you run from it even if it isn't hungry even if it just ate a elk
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.360]  and it's a dragon it's belly it's going to chase you down and going to kill you
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.880]  probably 90 plus percent chance they say i've
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.840]  even read a book on bears very interesting people that have dealt with
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.280]  them uh you run your your dinner i mean everybody
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.840]  knows that about dogs some big dog comes up to you
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.160]  on the street and starts acting like you know bite you
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.000]  if you run it's going to bite you you've got to say hey get your dog under
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.200]  control pal sometimes it's a punk and they go hey what's your
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.480]  problem you just got to tell him i'll stomp your head right now i'll stomp
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.960]  i mean you got to deal with punks out there but the point is is that i'm
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.800]  certainly not going to run from it and get attacked
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.600]  and and and we got to face this head on and all of you that work for the system
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:56.360]  listen if you don't know history and you can make excuses about what's going on
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.480]  when the supreme court set the rule that they can come in your house without
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.640]  warrants if a police dog smells something or that they can put cameras in
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:07.080]  your backyard without telling you without a warrant or put gps on your car
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.120]  without a warrant or pull you over and download your cell phone
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.400]  content saying it's not your personal belongings when it's as intimate as it
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.360]  gets i'm gonna stop right there and go to your calls
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.520]  tommy and others we're gonna get to all of this but you know i did this video
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:23.480]  that's gone viral it's going viral breaking mit romney elected
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.760]  40th president it's up on our big youtube channel
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.440]  get it out to everybody because it just points out how both sides are trying to
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.840]  act like i mean romney's already acting like he's the president
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.160]  obama's been acting presidential uh you know running around with the whole
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.840]  hurricane situation uh and you know quite frankly there's so much fraud
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.200]  i don't even know if the establishment knows who's going to get in that's why
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.080]  they just made sure they had both guys already bought and paid for
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.720]  and it does mean different styles i mean at least mit romney says churches
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.440]  shouldn't have to pay for abortions for their employees
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:00.040]  at least mit romney says and see i i say that because i feel
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:06.920]  immoral if i don't say at least romney has to pay lip service to good things
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.400]  but a lot of people that think the government's their mommy and their daddy
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.480]  and feel powerful through government uh you know through through that
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:17.560]  extension to that reflected glory they really think abortions a beautiful
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.000]  wonderful thing they really think a forced inoculation is a great thing
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.680]  they really i mean i run into these people they are so pathetic and and those
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.000]  that love government are always so pathetically naive and weak
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.240]  i mean they really think the government the man
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:38.840]  wants to give them a free lunch and a lot of them do get a free lunch but
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.120]  towards a greater takeover
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.080]  towards a greater destruction of society government and dependency
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:51.560]  wrecks civilizations there's there's no the facts are in over and over again on
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.400]  that okay i'm going to shut up let's go to
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.840]  tommy in new york uh tommy give us your report on where you are in new york and
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.080]  what you've witnessed and what's happening
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.080]  okay so i'm currently in the east village um also known as alphabet city
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.600]  which is uh where the probably the most devastation in new york
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:12.680]  in manhattan happened i also visited i'm only going to speak on what i what i've
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.120]  seen personally and then what i'm also hearing from residents in other places
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:21.000]  um i've been to long island and uh i've been all over manhattan and uh
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.120]  basically like part of the city is completely fine and
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.240]  doesn't even know what's going on down here and going about their daily lives
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.480]  as if nothing's happened meanwhile other people are struggling very very very
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.840]  very severely especially in places like statin island
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.640]  um long beach long island all the way down the barrier beaches uh rockaways
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.560]  in queens uh breezy breezy point which is actually a very uh
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.360]  upper class neighborhood was destroyed burned by fires 130 homes burned
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:52.200]  you know it's it's it's it's a very big spectrum between like
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.960]  parts of the city and um like i said i was expecting an exercise of
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.920]  martial law but that's not exactly what i saw how it's i want to i want to
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.560]  kind of go against the some of the reports that that that you guys are
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.120]  talking about what i've seen more than anything
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.720]  isn't people helping each other i really see neighbors really going out
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.440]  collecting food going into the projects over here the
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.400]  projects is the um um government housing in uh in the
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.680]  neighborhoods nearby and knocking on doors making sure elderly are okay
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.360]  bringing them food there was people with bicycles with bicycle power
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.640]  generators trying to make cell phone plug-in spots for people
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.640]  you know i haven't seen too much FEMA i've only seen like one
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.320]  maybe government truck around here in Manhattan um and
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.000]  it's basically the neighbors helping each other um and as i said before that
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.320]  there were bridge restrictions initially and you know the gas shortage
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.120]  immediately i thought wow martial law here it is they're gonna they're gonna
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.440]  try it but to be honest with you i think that
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.880]  it was all really practical what they did like when they opened up uh the
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.600]  bridges the next day there was such bad gridlock
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:54.440]  and there were no street lights so they couldn't like people just couldn't get
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.000]  places where they need to go so they created a bridge restriction and then
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.040]  they lifted it of a the bridge restriction was three people per car
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.160]  you couldn't get into inner out of Manhattan unless you had more than uh
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.800]  there one person with you and uh that was really really listen listen
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.960]  brother that's why we open the phones up
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.160]  unscreened from new york and new jersey to get your tag but let me just be specific
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:21.160]  i'm reporting on jersey shore um in their press release calling it martial law i
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.320]  didn't mean martial law in your area of of of Manhattan
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:28.280]  when you have what is it a half million people a year
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.200]  being stopped and frisked without warrants that's martial law
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.920]  my point is that uh this could be used to postpone the election which they're
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.160]  now talking about postponing or extending it
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:45.720]  uh and and actually if you were listening during the first hour i said
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:49.080]  it's the churches and the citizens and the people that were prepared
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.160]  that are taking care of people government can't and won't protect you and
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.560]  isn't delivering i have a whole stack of news here
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.920]  so so just to be clear that's my position from afar
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.520]  we've got you on to give us humid human intelligence on the ground but correct
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.600]  me if i'm wrong is i mean basically feme isn't doing anything
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.160]  uh as usual and it's the people that are maintaining civilization is that a
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.920]  correct statement uh from my view absolutely i've
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.520]  not seen uh fema really anywhere around these around my neighborhood
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.920]  on my mother actually who's in long island who just got power yesterday
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:27.160]  um she called them and she had no avail what ended up
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.680]  happening is i had to drive to pennsylvania to get gas and a generator and
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.240]  i brought it if you like look at a map it's like
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.080]  couple it's about a hundred miles or so 15 each direction i went all the way to
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.760]  pennsylvania got gas brought it all the way to long island tried to deliver it
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.080]  and um what i noticed is like people just very grossly unprepared and
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.680]  neighbors are helping each other not the government that's the big news here
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.640]  what percentage of people in closing would you say are totally unprepared
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.480]  half uh yeah i would say more than half
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.040]  actually but the city recovered well man new yorkers
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:02.680]  thank you we gotta go to break the worst drought in 50 years continues and the

[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:24.280]  rollout that records passenger conversations on city buses
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.720]  this has already happened all over the country they're now just admitting it
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.360]  and i'm so busy and now it's so passé that we lived in a police state so long
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:36.440]  that even i'm conditioned that i've confirmed
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.520]  they're putting up microphones inside and cameras and some of them
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:46.040]  inside street lights in austin i've confirmed it and i haven't even gone
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.320]  out to do a report yet i mean that's when you know you're living in
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.520]  tyranny where it's not even a big deal anymore
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:57.400]  unbelievable and again it's not for your safety let's get that through your head
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.680]  uh they haven't converted some police departments over to pure evil yet but
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.960]  they're trying uh let's go ahead and go to chet in new
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.480]  york then we'll go to bill and others chet in new york what are you seeing up
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.520]  there all right my friend how are you mr
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.880]  jones good crew good time going first first my
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:18.760]  prayers go out to a gentleman like tom and everyone on the uh
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:24.680]  the coast there up here in uh nazi bill we're at the uh south western shore of
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:30.600]  lake ontario yes and um all we had was like a storm surge
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.400]  on the lake and some high winds uh my daughter and um her
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.840]  husband went down to the lake because he lived close to the lake
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.120]  and they were just kind of riding around because they you know like being
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.720]  outside is how i grow them up and they're just watching the waves which was
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.680]  pretty high so the uh nazi storm troopers show up
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.520]  and they tell them they have to leave the area this is along the north greece
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.080]  road is what it's called uh up here in new york and um
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:03.640]  so even this far and because my son and while he asked he goes well why are you
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.640]  uh why are you asking us to leave there's you know we're just watching the waves
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.440]  he goes now there's going to be a disaster here
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:13.960]  which of course there wasn't we've been up here so long you know we've been
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.440]  again government where it's really bad like katrina or there in manhattan
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.600]  statin island in places just devastated government can't
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:28.200]  do anything and then but instead though we're nothing's going on
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.400]  they can run around and say you know get out of here when it's pretty clear a
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.040]  guy sitting there with his girlfriend or wife or whatever
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.000]  you know checking stuff out you don't want to couples out you know by the lake
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.480]  because it is neat i mean i grew up in dowell's on lake ray harvard and we used
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.520]  to go down um you know my dad mom and us and watch
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.560]  we didn't live on the lake we lived up the hill we'd go down by the park
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.800]  and watch the waves slamming in it was pretty cool uh but the point is is that
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.160]  but then you see their perspective hey let's just get everybody off the
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.720]  streets because they were told it was the end of the world
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.960]  so uh it's a complex issue but i i'm just glad
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.440]  people weren't hurt or killed in your area
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.280]  amen brother i was just trying to get that perspective from you know
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:09.960]  this far you know inland that's what they were doing and i know
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.040]  in manhattan of course in a new jersey it's a terrible mess
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.520]  but then you had like you know uh governor christie coming out as a thug
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.360]  you know basically he banned halloween so he could have all the
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.960]  candy bars sent to him probably and then you had
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.560]  you know mr bumblebird going you know hey let's have a race
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.800]  and i'm glad people stood up to him also where
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.560]  you know we're just i know you guys are all happy you know nothing worse
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:43.640]  uh happened on that end but we know the end run on that one is what you said
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:47.640]  earlier that they're trying to steer the election that's definitely in that
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.800]  uh a game plan of theirs and uh
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.240]  like i've always said uh my friend that you know people ask
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.520]  what is the new world order coming you're already living it
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.800]  yeah that's it it's already in the pot being boiled the question is
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.080]  how high is the flame real quick who do you think's going to win the election
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.760]  tomorrow i'm i'm pretty sure uh mr jones it's
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.560]  going to be romney i think that the fix in is for the count
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.160]  you know not all bundles huh because he already kicked out big bird is out
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.000]  you know a bumblebee's going under the boss well
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.240]  and like you okay when you were talking about the bookies and everything
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.800]  oh yeah in fact i meant to make this point about the bookies
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.400]  they're up there saying it's so scientific if they're throwing six billion
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.360]  dollars at this election the new york times is saying so who knows if that's
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:41.240]  even true it's over three billion they're saying it could be six billion when
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:45.000]  it's all done if they're throwing billions of dollars at this
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.360]  you can go shift these bets with a few million dollars
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:53.880]  just so they can say that it's going you know four to one obama but but i mean
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.480]  make your point about the bookies sorry oh no that's fine no i did i love you
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.840]  talking about it well when i was a young man i i know sometimes you talk about
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.360]  you and your buddies with the golf carts and uh taking a little bit of beer from
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.080]  people yeah well when i was a young fellow i used to
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.920]  like the gamble and i'm up here in in rochester which is a stronghold
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:14.200]  you know for the mafia and stuff so i knew after
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.160]  uh nightclubs and all that stuff you know play a little cards isn't that
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.520]  but the thing is once they put the section to where
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:27.480]  they give you that one that's supposed to win that's the one that's not gonna win
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.080]  you know that's how gamblers work well that's right they can run all sorts of
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.200]  scams and again folks yes the only theft i've ever
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.360]  engaged in is a few times taking wine and beer out of the golf cart
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.680]  ice chest of drunk golfers because we wanted beer when we were 14 15
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.160]  but i was also like spaulding from caddy shack i would go into the clubhouse
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.080]  and drink everybody's half drunk drink we're on the march

[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:52.120]  you have found it the tip of the spear coming to you from
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.760]  deep in the heart of fema region six formally austin texas
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.720]  i'm alex jones i want my country i want my freedom
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.240]  back i want the government off my back and i want the global corporations that
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:09.720]  are conquering us their economic espionage exposed
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.880]  and then defeat it i want the constitutional republic return okay
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:16.520]  i'm gonna try to go as many calls as i can now because i need to get to a
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:20.600]  bunch of news uh some military news police state news
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.240]  election news um the democrats openly engaging in
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.040]  race baiting and trying to get conflict going
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:32.520]  unbelievably despicable all of that is coming up bill in florida listening on
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:38.440]  wt an 13 40 a.m bill thank you for calling
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.360]  alex i have two issues i'm going to hit the first one and i'll hit the second
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:47.240]  one first issue has been on the news that mit romney's son tag
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.920]  uh is invested heavily in the voting machines of ohio
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:54.600]  okay and uh they said also colorado but i know
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.840]  ohio for sure and i've heard that on mainstream news me and then my
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.720]  buddy looked up on the computer he said sure enough is true well it's six one
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.000]  way half it doesn't the other it's a subsidiary of bane
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.760]  so it's not completely true but it's partially true
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.440]  that's very troubling in my opinion on that is i think the fix is in and romney's
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.680]  going to be the next president okay that the fix is in okay my next point
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:20.920]  we got another battery company on the verge of bankruptcy uh
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:24.920]  alex and a lot of there's a guy been going on all the internet and all the
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.280]  radio shows trying to pump this thing up and they did a
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.520]  reverse a one-for-five reverse stocks but two fridays ago
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:36.600]  their cfo walked off the job they're selling off their company left and
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.640]  right and they're trying to pump the stock up and if you guys own it get the
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:43.240]  hell out of it cbak is trying well here's the deal i don't i don't know
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:47.320]  anything about batteries and stocks and i don't want to even be anywhere near
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:50.360]  pump and dumps or whatever you're you know is going on
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.800]  so i can't really speak to that because i don't nothing about it
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.280]  alex it's cbak trades on our nasdaq and it's a shame
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.120]  okay well i mean i know the globalists do everything they can
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.560]  god bless you sir anything else have a point i want to make on this
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:10.440]  you know i i just want to say uh god help us tomorrow i got here's my big
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:14.280]  problem with romney and he's been pounding his chest from day one about
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:18.120]  going to war with iran okay and i heard a guy last night
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.560]  talking a guest on another show and he was saying that
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.760]  he surrounded himself with all the bush cheney people from the john bolton's
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:32.360]  to the one that uh exposed valley plane he's got all these neocons surrounded
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:35.640]  him and they all want to go to war with iran and that's what's very
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:38.840]  troubling that's the one reason why i don't want him in there alex is he wants
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.240]  to go to war with iran and we can't afford no i hear you i hear you but
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.840]  obama it is moving that way as well so i mean we're
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.480]  darned if we do and you know what if we don't thank you for the call
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.400]  yeah i've got it somewhere in this ridiculous stack and you guys document
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.280]  cam this i've got one two three four five six seven eight nine
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.840]  ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen ninety
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:04.760]  three got 25 stacks here 25 stacks of news and and that way when i
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.840]  read it all and go over it i could have knowledge when you call in on topics
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.920]  but it doesn't mean we ever get to get to about 10 of it
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:17.400]  here on air but here's the issue i saw an article and then even found the
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:20.680]  video bill clinton is now giving speeches saying
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:25.080]  mit romney is quote coming for the irish
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:29.800]  i mean this is unbelievable uh and again i guess just where i come from in
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.080]  texas i never heard anything about the irish i'm part irish myself but
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:37.000]  everybody around here if they're a quote anglo is behind 57 you know

[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.880]  it's like the whole nine yards uh you know my ancestor's been this country
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.360]  over 300 plus years and there's been a lot of
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.960]  intermarrying and stuff going on but bill clinton literally going
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:59.960]  listen i am irish as you know and he's he was bashing the italians mit romney
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.280]  is going after the italians and bill clinton is now attacking mit
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:10.280]  romney for saying we should ship jeep to italy
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:14.600]  as if it has anything to do with being anti-italian
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.640]  if you don't hey how about we keep jeep right here
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.480]  so that americans whether they're come from any background italian
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:25.160]  black i mean i don't care can have a job
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:31.400]  and our bailout money to gm and chrysler and all of this has been used to ship
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.240]  cadillac and volt and then chrysler division jeep
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:39.800]  overseas first it was going to go to china then it was going to go to um
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:45.640]  chinese parts and then assembled in italy look italy makes great cars

[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:01.240]  total racial thing with democrats do i will guarantee you and i'm not
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:06.360]  defending mit romney i'm defending reality to say that mit romney is bashing
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.960]  the italians that he came out and said don't ship jeep
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:13.560]  to italy it was in the news two weeks ago
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:17.240]  that jeep they're looking and the chrysler execs confirmed
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:23.240]  moving it to china or italy and now they're settling on parts from china
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:26.040]  assembled in italy
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:33.400]  i mean can we have something for america i mean and it turns into racism
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:38.760]  racism against italians that we don't want jeep going to italy
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.280]  and that bailout money has had general motors ship
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:49.720]  cadillac and volt to china i mean i want china to have a
[01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:52.760]  future i care about the chinese people they're not going to get a future
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:56.600]  working at slave labor levels that's just going to lower our future
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.280]  many chinese are worse off than they were a few decades ago if you're the top
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.440]  communist chinese they're billionaires and people making money off of enslaving
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.800]  the people with suicide nets around the apple factories
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.160]  by the way every time i mentioned suicide nets people call me or email me or
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.360]  on the street go i thought you were making that up about suicide nets and
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.880]  forced abortions at the apple factories the apple contractor factories
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:21.560]  i went and looked that up that's true yeah they got mobile execution vans too
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.000]  in china and every city 24 per major city
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.280]  don't believe me just type in suicide van i mean uh not suicide vans execution vans
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.840]  guys type in execution vans china it'll be ap
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.040]  roiders photos of them choking women dragging them into them to gut them
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.920]  rich americans flying and get the quote fresh organs
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:42.440]  you know the point is is that when you let china go to this low level
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:47.240]  it sucks the whole world down globalism is a is a giant sucking sound like ross
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.400]  perot said and boy was he right about naft and get
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:55.000]  boy howdy was he but i mean i saw that video this morning
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.560]  and i mean i meant to send it to you guys i didn't
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:01.320]  there is china's high-tech death van where criminals are executed and then
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.080]  our organs are sold on the black market that's for march of 2009 it was first
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.400]  in the financial times of london a year before
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.640]  that yeah there is being let on to be killed i mean you can't make this up
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:15.240]  if you find the times of london when it's got him choking a woman with a rope
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:18.680]  around her neck as they drag her in
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:24.760]  i mean the point is the mass clonings going on they
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:29.640]  use babies for rendering plants of dead babies they forcibly abort
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.920]  that then is put into college and for women's products
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:40.680]  heaven help us because when we ride off china or when they say oh it's building
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.680]  their economy up no it's not it's a race to the bottom the chinese
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:48.600]  i went and saw a movie that i want to review because it's got some good things in
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:51.800]  it some bad things i believe the makers the wachowski
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:56.120]  brother and sister uh i believe that they are good people i know people that
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:59.480]  know them and they say they've seen my films and
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.440]  listen to show some so if you're out there at wachowskis we'd like to have you
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:05.880]  on but i went and saw a cloud atlas with my wife and
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:11.080]  you know uh it's it's all about human liberty and empowering humanity uh
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.600]  some of it i think is negative but i think it comes from a perspective
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.520]  where they really do want to liberate people i'm not going to
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.840]  blow the the plot of the film for you but it deals with
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.120]  a future where we're dehumanized biological androids
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:30.120]  well folks when you see the drones going in to be rendered in this movie
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.200]  and fed back to the other drones silent green
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.280]  that's what's really going on but in a more sophisticated system
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:41.960]  through the hospitals through the where they steal the wealth the energy you
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:45.000]  stored up through the cancer industry
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.040]  that's why i don't like lance armstrong all the things i know about him
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:51.480]  because families know him and i have multiple connections to lance armstrong
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.680]  just i live here in austin and just happened to fall in with people that
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:57.560]  have been you know very close to him you know best friends with his wife people
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.240]  like that his ex-wife and i knew what a bad person he was but so what he's a
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.320]  bad arrogant you know chauvinist uh narcissistic
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:11.000]  you know guy that's his issue bigger they are the harder they fall
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.480]  it's just frustrating that i got him through two separate people
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:19.800]  that i knew knew him well got him information on cancer viruses and
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.320]  vaccine the cancer industry hey why don't we find the cause instead of the
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.200]  cure and it was just all about him getting tax
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.120]  free money and that i was told to go to hell
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:33.640]  by by by both people that they went they brought it to him
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:37.000]  caring listeners people one guy that was on a board with him
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.360]  another person that knows him intimately they bring it to lance armstrong
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:43.720]  and he goes alex jones i'm not even looking at what that conspiracy
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.960]  bleeper says but hey this is about let's find the cause
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.040]  not not the cure and he didn't want to hear any of it
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.400]  and you know because because i literally dream
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:58.520]  about having the type of power that lance armstrong had but see
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.680]  he was typecast and chosen by the establishment to be their front man
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:06.200]  because they knew who he was they helped him cheat in the cycling associations
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:09.000]  that's come out and then now they're destroying him because that's part of
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.840]  the ritual build up the hero destroy it so you think there's nobody really good
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.320]  in the world they want to sell you on giving up and being
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:20.200]  corrupt well let me just explain something i'm no hero but i'm real
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:24.040]  i try to only promote what i believe is the best products
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.560]  and that i feel good promoting that i personally use
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:32.440]  to fund my operation and still feel guilty doing it i try to tell you the
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:35.720]  truth i try to really get reality and really
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.640]  pay it forward because i believe in humanity i want us to have a future
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:44.360]  i'm in love with the creativity and the beauty that our species has put forward
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.840]  and
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.280]  i want human liberty i want freedom and i don't want scam artists running
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:53.160]  everything because they are shuttered mentally
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:56.840]  we're going to go to more of your calls people are holding we're going to get to
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:02.600]  cj and uh michael and uh then cindy and mark and
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.560]  lauren and everybody we're gonna get to everybody coming up i need to start
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.760]  getting to some of this news right now i i covered this some
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:14.120]  yesterday but it it makes me so angry to know
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.880]  people high up in mtv who in the mid 90s were told
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:21.640]  we're going to take the most destructive gangster culture and we're
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.360]  going to first deploy it into the black community and then we're going to
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.680]  deploy it into all the other communities to basically destroy people
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:33.640]  and krs one professor griff they've all spoken about it as black men successful
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:37.560]  artist but the folks i've talked to from multiple angles
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:41.320]  are white and they were there and wouldn't be part of it
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.880]  okay but the point is is that this is scientific when bill marr gets up and
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:50.440]  says obama needs to be more gangsterish and pull out guns on people
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.040]  but but he's for banning citizens having guns he just wants people illegally
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:58.040]  as gangbangers having guns and black gangbangers and and and wrap
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:01.000]  people killing each other because that's what a man does no that's not what a
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:04.440]  man does a man stays with their wife and raises their family or at least tries
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:07.400]  to take care of their family
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:10.520]  and to know that this has been deployed and to know bill marr says he wants more
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.200]  abortion and to know that we've got we found more liberals on tape now
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:18.040]  including black people saying let's get rid of black people to see stuff like
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.880]  this while they lecture those of us that are against socialism
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.920]  see obama care is bad because it's written by the insurance companies to
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.920]  force us into government eugenics health care that's why it's bad
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.920]  not because obama's black and it makes me angry they know full well
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.200]  people don't like socialism because they know how horrible it is they know full
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:39.080]  well with it because it's because they hate black people what does that even
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:43.080]  have to do with it it's like saying it's like saying
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.720]  i don't like uh you know orange juice you say well that means you don't like
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:50.440]  japanese people and you're like what does that have to do with it
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.440]  they inject this in there and shove it in there and then all the public is
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.640]  conversant in is race and group stuff and
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:01.400]  what group they identify with and i'm so sick of it it's all part of this
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.920]  hollowness and then i see michael moore put out
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.880]  videos where they talk about ripping mit romney's genitals off and uh
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.920]  and and and this latest thing from last friday night with bill marr saying
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:18.200]  you know black people are going to come after white people if
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:23.800]  if obama doesn't win implying that obama loses its election fraud
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.160]  hey bill marr why don't you talk about how there's election fraud in black box
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:31.960]  systems across the board instead of always doing this and i happen to know
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:36.440]  people that know bill marr very well he is a horrible person
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:40.520]  he is a self-centered pig and i predict his downfall just like lance
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:44.040]  armstrong you got god to deal with buddy but i'm so we're going to do some
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.800]  reports on him when he says he loves death and loves abortion these are sick
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:51.960]  people and they make me so angry because these are the
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.480]  people that are going to hold back humanity and i'm tired of them
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:58.440]  i'm tired of them showing the seeds of our destruction
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:01.560]  so they can play the part of the good guy referee while they're selling the
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:04.200]  gangster culture we got a bunch of clips together we're going to
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.720]  report soon david ortiz wants to do it with all of his different clips just
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:11.080]  you know saying black should be gangbangers black should be vicious
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:16.120]  black should be you know i'm again that was done to destroy
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:19.480]  black communities kind of the cherry on top
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:22.840]  and it makes me sick let's go ahead and go to this clip of him right here
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.720]  here's bill marr so i would just like to say for anyone
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:31.640]  thinking about voting for mit romney if that's who you are if you're thinking
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.000]  about voting for i'd like to make this one plea
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.080]  black people know who you are and they will come after you
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.080]  you know what if uh some people see that and they think it's licensed
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.520]  i will guarantee you with three million listeners a day conservatively
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.120]  if i got up on air and i said go attack a certain group
[01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:55.880]  i guarantee you people would go out and attack
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:00.920]  that's just the way it is everybody's got unstable viewers and listeners
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:05.240]  and that guy they air it over and over again has probably 10 million viewers
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.800]  in a week not even a million watch it when the first
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:10.600]  air they aired that thing over and over again i've looked at the numbers probably
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.000]  10 million viewers worldwide probably five million of them
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.240]  guesstimation i've seen the numbers before domestically
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:22.280]  wow what happens if romney wins by hooker by crook or whatever
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:27.400]  white people deserve to be attacked because black people know your white
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.560]  know you did it i mean that is crazy and this is something that's taught
[01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:34.360]  by the new black panther party leaders down in houston i've seen them on the
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:36.760]  news say don't mug in the black neighborhood go
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.400]  mug in the white neighborhood how about don't mug anywhere
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.960]  you see this is so crazy and this is meant to get whites and blacks scared of
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:46.840]  each other that's what that sick pimp is doing that's
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:51.880]  what he's doing is to destroy unity and we're better to do it but from a fake
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:57.560]  liberal perspective bill marr is a disgusting pig and ought to be
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:00.040]  wearing a swastika armband because that's tough stuff

[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:58.840]  the globalists don't intend it to but every week now there's new

[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:22.680]  you're on the air hi alex thanks uh thanks for taking my
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:25.880]  call uh a long time listener first time caller
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:30.120]  um kind of a pretty good intro uh into what i was going to talk to you about
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:35.080]  which is um it's election stuff uh with what i see is uh
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.080]  the scripting that's been going on with all this race baiting and stuff
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.840]  imagine the imagine a uh a closely contested
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:47.560]  election with um uh the u n observer stepping forward
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.120]  pointing out election fraud and and uh and then all these riots begin to start
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.320]  down uh down there and uh all the sudden um
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:00.360]  the election results are going to be suspended martial laws
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:04.120]  is uh in post and what a great cover for a
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:07.560]  uh financial collapse or a or an attack on a ramp
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:11.320]  i'll tell you this they always the globalist this has been proven over and
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:14.680]  over again with declassifications they always have plans where
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:18.760]  if something starts happening on its own they capitalize on it
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:22.200]  that's what ron emmanuel famously said that guys you cue that up i think we
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:24.680]  haven't saved it's on c span it's like 20 seconds
[02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:28.360]  don't let a good crisis go to waste he also said it to the wall street journal
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.600]  there's video from them too he said it repeatedly
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:34.520]  but but yeah they either they always have contingency plans dozens of them
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.040]  running for any contingency any scenario
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.720]  on how to capitalize what their focus groups what their studies
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:45.320]  what their nsa snooping shows the public's really thinking
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:48.840]  versus what they tell pollsters and how they're going to try to game us i mean
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:51.480]  it's a scientific system we face but being aware of it
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.000]  is half the battle it's not it's not unstoppable if people just wake up to
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.120]  it but but i've got to say it looks like it's in the
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:01.640]  cards doesn't mean they're going to play that card but you got five six cards in
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:04.520]  your hand it's in the fist right now of the
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:09.240]  establishment uh to basically activate and and have
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:11.800]  provocateurs or whatever start rioting
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:14.840]  and burning things down as some type of crisis
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:19.400]  if the election is contested because yeah i mean if romney just won
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.600]  i don't think people would riot but if it's it's close
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.600]  and it comes out there's fraud and the supreme court's going to hear it
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.680]  uh obama told his cousin uh odinga to to riot
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:33.160]  to so he would get a place in the government and they created a prime
[02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:36.840]  ministership for him and uh webster tarpoli uh kind of
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:41.000]  pointed this out in the obama deception uh which is still the preeminent film
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.880]  exposing obama it's free online folks if you type in the obama
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:47.720]  deception i think i'll tweet out the best high rest link of that to folks
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:50.440]  but uh yes i mean i'm ranting off of your point but
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.240]  that's pretty much what i was thinking before the show today and i never got
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:57.400]  around to saying it um what do you make of bill marz saying
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:59.640]  black people need to go out and hunt down whites
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.400]  if romney's elected uh what do you make of uh
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:07.880]  michael moore putting out multiple videos as you know saying
[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:13.320]  uh physically attack romney if he wins uh burn things down if romney wins
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:17.320]  i mean that really is a call for criminal action and and it's not a joke i
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.840]  mean this is this is what we're seeing on twitter
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:24.040]  uh and then i get criticized when i pointed out
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.360]  uh by globalist media implying i'm racist uh because i don't want to have
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:33.080]  racial conflict uh in this country that could set things back decades
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:36.760]  well i think uh there is a an element within the
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:42.600]  the liberal left uh race baiting crowd that is drooling at the prospect of an
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.280]  of an absolutely out and out race war in the united states
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:49.880]  um i think they've been looking for it for a long time and no they said they
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:54.840]  have i mean that's what all of obama's advisors that came out in in trials
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:58.840]  uh you know heirs and others said we're gonna implode the economy
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:03.400]  poses saviors put 50 million people in reeducation camps and kill half of them
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.400]  and and and now the army says they have the camps i'm sorry go ahead
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:12.200]  well i mean uh you know again from the perspective of the the sort of new world
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:16.040]  order types they would uh they would ritually want to have uh america
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:19.240]  destroy itself and hence you've had the production
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:22.600]  moved offshore because uh if they want to maintain it they've got to get it out
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:26.920]  of the united states yeah i mean look america was not
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.240]  perfect but we were the example of freedom
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:32.680]  four percent of the population had half the wealth the biggest middle class
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:37.160]  the world had ever seen an example that countries had to live up to
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:39.960]  they could you know the communist countries couldn't produce one tenth
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:43.640]  and so they brought in globalism to wreck us to take our jobs and ship them
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:46.600]  to authoritarian nations to make authoritarianism
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:50.920]  the model and so china and singapore and other
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:54.760]  tyrannies they admit are now the models i open up time
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:58.360]  magazine i open up wall street journal i open up i'm thinking of things i've
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:03.000]  read the last year uh i open up national geographic
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.120]  and they call it the singapore model which is really the kind of the chinese
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:09.400]  authoritarian model with a british style overlay
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:12.600]  and that's where they want to go and let me tell you it isn't a nice place
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:16.280]  god bless you i appreciate your call uh let's go to another caller here yeah
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:19.960]  great points he just made uh who's been holding the longest here let's talk to
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:25.880]  sindy in ohia welcome sindy hello hey sindy
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:30.360]  alex um long-time listener first-time caller and i admire your courage
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:33.880]  your stamina and your wife for giving you the space to do this
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:38.760]  anyway um i'm sort of a storm victim power went out here i just got back from
[02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:42.680]  a hotel for a week um i'm in north elm said a suburb of
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:46.680]  cleveland and i've lived for all my life and it wasn't that bad
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:50.840]  and the fact that i think it was up to half a million people without power
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:55.160]  for an extended period of time is um very suspicious to me
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:58.600]  and because i'm aware of harp and and all those things i knew this was coming
[02:15:58.600 --> 02:16:02.120]  where i swing stayed after all do i sound nervous
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:06.120]  no ma'am you sound great okay um so i was prepared i got a hotel room and all
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:10.040]  that and just got back today was gone for almost a week
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:14.840]  and um the interesting thing is this what happened to state of ohio is we sent
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:20.200]  out cei ohio Edison workers to help new jersey so
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:24.520]  we didn't have anyone here and i was at the holiday in and a big shout out for
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:27.400]  them they're wonderful they didn't raise rates so they reduced rates
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:30.920]  and while i was there it was filled with electrical workers
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:37.960]  shipped in from colorado now look at the map how far is colorado from ohio
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:43.960]  colorado is also a swing state and i'm not sure how that works as far as
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:47.800]  counting voters and all of that but it seems very
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:51.800]  unusual to me that they would haul into ohio
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:55.560]  all these people from colorado you know there's indianas oh no there's
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:01.320]  you know plenty of states closer isn't that interesting
[02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:07.000]  well a lot of it is colorado has dealt with a lot of natural disasters i mean
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.200]  that could be one of the reasons uh i don't know though that's something we
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:12.920]  should look into wish you would and while i've got
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:16.200]  you in the phone one quick point and i'm glad i got through to tell you this
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:19.320]  because i hear you talking about harp and all that and you may not know this
[02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:24.200]  there's um a company called company it's a multinational called bay systems b a e
[02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:27.320]  i know you've heard of them they bought the harps patents and every
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:32.120]  people look this up and they have their headquarters
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:36.200]  located now this is like within the past two years in saudi arabia
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:39.640]  so in saudi arabia now are housed the patents
[02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:45.480]  for the harp project well i knew that there are literally
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:48.920]  hundreds of patents dealing with weather modification really probably thousands
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.840]  but dozens and dozens from the easterman corporation
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.040]  that originally developed the harp program really
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:00.280]  50 years ago or so but thank you so much for your points
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:04.520]  again we're going to continue tracking the election we're going to continue
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:07.320]  taking your phone calls i want to get into some big brother news here in a
[02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:11.000]  moment but since i mentioned it here is that
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.120]  video and audio of rama manual when he was a white house
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.760]  chief of staff before he went on to run chicago
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:24.600]  as the big boss there saying that don't let a good crisis go to waste
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:28.120]  you never want a serious crisis to go to waste
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:30.920]  and what i mean by that it's an opportunity to do things that you think
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:34.120]  you could not do
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:38.280]  and i guess that's a shorter version uh that we found there in fact can we find
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:41.880]  the long version where he goes on and explains all of it
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:46.360]  uh yeah because here i can do it just uh i can pull up
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:50.760]  uh you can't hear my audio what do you mean
[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:54.920]  no i mean i can find you a spot where it's at with the full clip
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:57.880]  we've saved that clip quite a few times let's just call it don't let a good
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:01.720]  crisis go to waste and uh we'll uh we'll try to get that
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:05.160]  clip for everybody but but there was there was part of the quote
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.520]  here is a quote henry kissinger and address the builderberg organization
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:13.000]  meeting an evian france may 21st 1991 transcribe from the tape

[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:20.360]  today americans would be outraged if u n trips entered los angeles
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:24.040]  to restore order tomorrow they will be grateful this is especially true if they
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:27.480]  were told there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:31.400]  promulgated the threatened our very existence it is then that all people's
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:35.000]  in the world will pledge with world leaders
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.600]  and will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:42.440]  the one thing every man fears is the unknown when presented with

[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.960]  when what's bad is insider crony monopolies

[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:23.960]  and we had more than half the wealth now it's down to like 25 to 30 percent
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:27.800]  depending on which number you look at half our wealth is gone
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:32.280]  it's going to get worse it's all designed
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:36.200]  all by design to reduce us to absolute serfdom and slavery
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:40.280]  if we ever allow private banks to take control of the issuance and control
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:44.840]  of currency our children will wake up homeless on the continent our

[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:00.600]  or you can keep going down the road because see these aren't just people
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:04.200]  that want to run everything they want to run your body
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:07.640]  they like putting stuff in your body and they like killing you
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:11.160]  that's their instinct is a will to total domination and you know what i don't
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:13.240]  like it i don't like the world they build they're ugly
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:17.240]  new order is ugly and i don't like them and i want to wake people up and defeat
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:19.880]  them and move humanity back in the right
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:22.280]  direction doesn't mean we've got all the answers doesn't mean we're offering
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:26.040]  some utopia but we know where they're taking us is hell
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:30.280]  i'll take just a normal system over dystopia
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:33.240]  i'm not offering utopia but i know we can get away from this
[02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:37.560]  dystopic reality let's go to some phone calls here and then i'll come back
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:42.280]  with news and more calls lauren in new york you're on the air thanks for
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:46.840]  holding how you doing alex i'm all right sir new york
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:50.920]  um here's the thing uh here's my take on this and i'm going to let you break it
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:56.600]  down um obama the thing is what obama he we all
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:59.960]  know he's a marxist uh he has uh ties to the muslim
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:04.120]  brotherhood he has ties to every muslim down there in um
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:09.160]  libya uh yeah times to his uh cousin over there like you were saying i believe
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:13.080]  just today uh yes ties his cousin over there who is a muslim
[02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:17.960]  so we need to really evaluate ourselves as american people now
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:20.840]  at the end of the day i don't have anything against muslims but
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.760]  this guy is the worst type of muslim he's one of those guys i don't i don't
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:28.360]  understand he he does a factor in his skin color at all
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:32.280]  because he let al qaeda kill black people in wholesale
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:36.520]  in libya i don't understand how by the way i predicted it webster tarply
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:41.080]  predicted it in the obama deception uh that's what freaks me out
[02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:46.120]  tarply says romney's going to be worse and i i just
[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:49.720]  i'm just desperate i'm like somebody i was thinking this morning
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:53.480]  and i was swimming down about 20 feet under the water in the river
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:57.800]  i went for an exercise a mile swim and have time to swim two miles point is
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:02.200]  i went down usually i go down 25 30 feet sometimes some of the deeper areas
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:06.200]  but i went down and only about 20 feet kind of didn't have a good breath of
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:11.720]  air and i wanted to get to the top and uh and i likened it to that wanting to
[02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:14.840]  get out of this new world order is like someone who's under water who just
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:20.520]  wants oxygen but i'm sorry go ahead yeah definitely but i i i don't
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:25.400]  understand how romney could be worse than that i mean black people were killed in
[02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:31.400]  wholesale in libya cleansed how could romney be worse than that i i can i
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:35.240]  can't see it well again i mean it's the illusion
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:38.360]  that we all buy into even if we know it's an illusion we're like a man in the
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:41.640]  desert either somebody under water that wants oxygen
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:44.360]  even if they don't they're not sure there's air up there you go up you're
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:48.360]  trying to get to it and it's the same thing with
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:54.840]  uh people somewhere like the united states i mean we just want to
[02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:58.840]  believe that a president will come in and stop trying to wage war on us but
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:02.360]  that's what they want they want to bankrupt us to dominate us
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:05.560]  i mean in the old days they just come in and and and you know carpet bomb your
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:11.640]  entire city to take you over uh and so this is 21st century war it's
[02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:15.800]  cultural war it's chemical war it's biological war it's
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.200]  it's spiritual war but yeah i mean obama is super bad news but hey
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:23.320]  these aren't wars he's launching because he got a peace prize these are peace
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:27.880]  actions who do you think's gonna win tomorrow
[02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:33.480]  um i i don't i don't care i just want this country to change i just want
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:37.240]  i want these people in jail exactly and that's the only reason i've thought
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:40.840]  romney might get in it's just people are hitting the reset button desperately
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:44.360]  but there's so many people that are dependent now they think obama
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.280]  you know is really giving them a free lunch when he's not

[02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:05.400]  from all the angles uh pointing out how both groups are basically mafias fighting
[02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:09.720]  for control of the ceo job of slavery incorporated
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:13.400]  well that's what we're dealing with but first here is that don't let a crisis
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:17.480]  go to waste clip you never want a serious crisis to go
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.760]  to waste and what i mean by that it's an opportunity to
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:23.800]  do things that you think you could not do before
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:27.560]  i think america as a whole in 1973 and 1974 not just
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:31.160]  my view but obviously the administration missed the opportunity to deal with the
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:35.160]  energy crisis that was before us for a long time our entire energy policy
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:39.080]  came down to cheap oil this is an opportunity what used to be
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:42.600]  long-term problems be they in the health care area energy area
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:49.960]  education area fiscal area tax area regulatory reform area
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:53.640]  things that we had postponed for too long that were long term are now
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:59.240]  immediate and all right there you go and uh that's the program provides the
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:03.720]  opportunity for us that the communist uh engage in over and over again again
[02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:08.280]  these are mega banks using communist tactics to make us communalized
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:12.040]  and all on the plantation while they're exempt internationally from it all
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:16.840]  see it's really fascist is the best term using socialist and communist
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:20.200]  authoritarian systems on the public to make you dependent
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:23.320]  you want to domesticate somebody you've got to give them a little bit of chicken
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:28.040]  feed and that's what's happening here
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:31.880]  and it's very very sad that they've deindustrialized us
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:36.920]  now they know that massive numbers some estimates are 20 percent of doctors
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:41.080]  are retiring earlier because they don't want to be under government health care
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:44.120]  they don't want to be under the mandates uh they've got the federal
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:46.680]  government coming in with state governments taking over health care
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:49.560]  institutions everywhere and as long as you do what they
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:54.040]  say you can do whatever you want you can have little kids die from vaccines you
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:57.480]  can grab people's kids you can have the place filthy and people
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:01.000]  dying of infections you can you can rip people off but you
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.280]  don't play ball with them you're going to jail
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:08.280]  and now your health records go to the IRS so they can pass that around the
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:10.120]  government everything that's gone on in your life
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:13.800]  you think the IRS had enemies list before I think the FBI used
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:18.280]  income taxed up before all of this is about criminals in government
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:23.240]  stacking the deck against the people and uh Rahm Emanuel is a monster you
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:27.080]  didn't pull clips of him up on c-span but also in speeches saying
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:32.440]  everyone will do 18 months of service uh in your senior in your junior and
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:38.760]  senior year of high school and then each summer after that from 18 to 54
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.320]  you will go and be part of brigade homeland and then now they have femacore
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:46.440]  it's now been officially set up and uh it's
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:50.680]  anti-gun groups marching around uh and spying on people and getting in people's
[02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:54.280]  faces uh and it's just pushing government
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:57.560]  and and and and and tattle tailing and these people that are part of this
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.720]  because i've seen them on the streets they
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:05.320]  are literally like little tsa agents and they're going to be the little
[02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:09.160]  chivanos that tony montana talks about the fit the fictional character
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:12.520]  based on historical events uh in scarface written by
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:16.760]  oliver stone and he's trying to get into the u.s to get amnesty
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:20.280]  and uh you know he's saying i'm a political dissident i want my
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:24.360]  righteous like president jimmy carter says and the guy says you know what
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:28.440]  send him to freedom town he goes hey there's nothing you can do to me that
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:32.680]  castra was not already done and he goes you want to beat squid three four
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:35.320]  times a day you want somebody telling you when to
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:39.320]  get up when to go to sleep when to go to work what to wear what to do you want
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:43.640]  a chivano on every corner telling you you know uh watching every move
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:48.600]  that's what we're going under i mean it it's it's it's like if you said black
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:52.760]  Cadillac everybody knows what a black Cadillac looks like
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:57.000]  well this is tyranny it's like saying yellow school bus everybody knows what
[02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:00.840]  a yellow school bus looks like if you have any basic understanding
[02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:04.920]  like i say great white shark you see a great white shark
[02:38:04.920 --> 02:38:09.880]  i say red bicycle you see a red bicycle if i say abraham lincoln you see an
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:13.720]  image abraham lincoln but but people don't seem to understand or if they do
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:20.600]  they don't understand how dangerous it is this is tyranny enslavement bad very
[02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:23.880]  bad people like well what does that look like well it looks like what we're
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:28.760]  now midway into and and with the tyranny they bring tyrannies in when they
[02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:33.160]  decide to make you poor as a tool of control see a lot of people say i don't
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:35.240]  care if there's tyranny i'm going to go along with it
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:38.200]  oh you are
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:41.880]  you don't seem to understand historically there are really bad people
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:45.720]  who like to hurt people who like to destroy wealth
[02:38:45.720 --> 02:38:50.920]  who like to take what you got who enjoy it things that normal people
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:55.640]  aren't into the legion of evil is into you see
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:00.280]  governments become these artificial constructs
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:05.720]  where really corrupt bad people
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:12.600]  can have their way with the general population
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:16.760]  government becomes kingdoms where people that really can't produce anything
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:23.640]  but can socially get in and compete to to to be more manipulative more corrupt
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.800]  more scheming and then it becomes a survival of the fittest
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:32.520]  of the worst of the worst who then rise to the top and take over
[02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:37.560]  the city of austin who i've pointed out is a group of criminals the the city
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:40.600]  council by and large is just absolutely larcenous
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:43.960]  um they have gotten in trouble with the county attorney
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:47.080]  for a decade of having their meetings in secret and given their friends and
[02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:50.600]  family giant contracts i mean it's a giant scam
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:54.360]  i personally have gone and looked at contracts i personally have done
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:59.160]  investigations that have sent people to prison just look it up
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:03.000]  and it's openly criminal and what did because citizens were the whistle what
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.480]  did the county attorney do they said well you're not in trouble this time
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:11.320]  but don't do it anymore i was on the hiking bike trail
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:15.400]  yesterday and i'm sitting there stretching
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:19.080]  and my wife's already gone down the gully with the with the french bulldog
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:21.400]  to you and i'm like i want to stretch he was i'm gonna run to the bottom i'll
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:25.560]  see you down there and so she starts going and i watch
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:28.200]  this group come up and i'm sitting there stretching
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:31.400]  over to the side and i hear i'm going we're gonna get more funding we'll get
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:34.280]  the revenue this way we'll swap that they're like
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.680]  oh there's somebody over there and i kind of had my back slightly turned
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:41.400]  and i could tell they were city people so i waited till they started walking
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:44.600]  down i started walking behind them listening to them
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:48.360]  later they're coming back and we're down by the creek
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:53.000]  like an hour later and they're over there
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:56.440]  and they're in the woods meeting in secret and i don't know who they were
[02:40:56.440 --> 02:40:59.000]  or what department but i went and he's dropped on enough
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.960]  that they were having an illegal meeting in the woods
[02:41:01.960 --> 02:41:05.800]  i mean folks this is how widespread this is i cannot go
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:11.400]  on a hiking bike trail where in an hour and a half i might have seen 15 people
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:15.240]  to go climb up and down the hills and things and there's literally bureaucrats
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:19.000]  meeting in the woods in secret and then they saw me creeping over they're like
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:23.160]  oh he's listening let's go and they kind of scurried off on down the
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:27.880]  the deal having a secret meeting they were bureaucrats you could tell
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:31.880]  and they were talking about about the city and how they're going to get more
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:33.960]  money
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:38.840]  guys search uh money in the ut permanent fund last time i checked it was four
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:42.760]  billion dollars in cash a billion and a half in gold
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:46.920]  their real estate was uh valued at over a hundred billion dollars
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:51.480]  uh and their investments their kaffir investments comprehensive annual
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:54.120]  financial reports investments were at 400 billion
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:56.920]  so i don't know how much money that is you do the math but in the university of
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:41:59.720]  texas is the richest university in the world
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:04.440]  the they they charge more tuition more to park more it's not even a university
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:09.960]  it's a facade for a crime syndicate and they want
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:13.160]  two hundred and ninety something dollars per household
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.960]  over the next ten years every year to pay for a new university medical center
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:21.400]  when they literally
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:26.680]  own half the state of texas but all the public knows about the four billion
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:29.160]  dollar permanent fund and the billion and a half in gold and
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:31.480]  other stuff you look at the real estate you look at the comprehensive
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:35.080]  financial report i mean you heard me hundreds of billions it was over
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:37.960]  400 billion years ago when i looked it up
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:40.360]  they've got
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.240]  well in excess of 500 billion dollars in assets one way or another let's be
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:50.440]  conservative and they want to set the precedent
[02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:53.480]  and they've got all these idiot signs up around where i live this happening in
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:56.360]  your town too with a big heart saying love austin
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:00.520]  vote for prop one and i've seen polls where almost everybody's against it
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:03.400]  it'll probably pass because they're electronic voting fraud
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:09.560]  we're run by a mafia here i'll look it up ut permanent fund
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:12.840]  that that's just the one little thing they tell you about
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:25.880]  university of texas permanent fund how much does it say is in there
[02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:31.240]  yeah it's 12.8 billion now that's a total for it's much more than that
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:37.480]  the point is is that you just type in they bought a billion of gold last year
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:41.720]  they already had a half billion you people
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.320]  are a bunch of lunatic crooks okay and i've had enough of you
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:48.440]  and and the people don't care as long as they can wear a ut shirt that's their
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:52.600]  tribe that's their future to be milked by these people
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:56.200]  and every water district every school district everything
[02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:59.880]  over 70 percent of their money is in private offshore funds which are public
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:03.000]  but no one seems to care and they talk about how we got to raise taxes all
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.840]  day or off the layoff cops give me a break
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:10.840]  the truth is the industrial society created fabulous wealth beyond
[02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:14.440]  anyone's imaginations and they don't want the public becoming empowered
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.760]  because you become uppity let's go to this great promo
