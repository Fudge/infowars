[00:00.000 --> 00:10.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Wednesday, the 17th day of August, 2016 global edition.
[00:10.480 --> 00:14.640]  We are going to be having several very informative surprise guests in studio today.
[00:14.640 --> 00:17.680]  I'm just going to leave it at that until the next segment.
[00:17.680 --> 00:21.840]  We have a big shake up at the Trump campaign with the head of Breitbart being brought into
[00:21.840 --> 00:22.840]  head things up.
[00:22.840 --> 00:29.280]  A really good move, Mr. Bannon is there and Hillary House Republicans pursue perjury charges
[00:29.280 --> 00:30.360]  against Hillary.
[00:30.360 --> 00:36.040]  This is her Nixonian moment, but first an extremely powerful Paul Revere report from
[00:36.040 --> 00:43.120]  John Bowne, yet another American community is descended on by violent ignorance masquerading
[00:43.120 --> 00:50.600]  as a civil rights protest after a black career criminal was taken out by a black police officer
[00:50.600 --> 00:54.840]  after dangerously brandishing a stolen firearm.
[00:54.840 --> 01:00.280]  So where are the leaders of the supposed righteous anger boiling over in Milwaukee?
[01:00.280 --> 01:05.840]  Typically, President Barack Obama fiddled on the golf course while Rome burned.
[01:05.840 --> 01:11.200]  Obama's deputy press secretary, Jen Friedman, provided a statement that read, the president
[01:11.200 --> 01:17.080]  is golfing at Farm Neck Golf Club, one of his favorite courses on Martha's Vineyard.
[01:17.080 --> 01:23.440]  Also today, the administration said the president had been updated on the situation in Milwaukee.
[01:23.440 --> 01:30.200]  Meanwhile, Obama protégé and Soros insulated leader of Black Lives Matter, DeRay McKesson,
[01:30.200 --> 01:37.600]  tweeted, I denounce the state violence that led to any protests in the first place.
[01:37.600 --> 01:44.120]  Is this statement a result of McKesson's shallow incomprehension in the face of total anarchy
[01:44.120 --> 01:46.080]  based on the real facts?
[01:46.080 --> 01:52.360]  Or is there another hand at play here directing Obama's incompetence and McKesson's callowness?
[01:52.360 --> 01:57.760]  It should come as no surprise that Black Lives Matter leader DeRay McKesson lives in a home
[01:57.760 --> 02:02.400]  owned by philanthropists James and Robin Wood in Baltimore, Maryland.
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.400]  The American Mirror reports it's the same address he used when declaring his residency
[02:07.400 --> 02:13.240]  on his campaign committee registration form for his failed mayoral run in the city's Democratic
[02:13.240 --> 02:15.640]  primary earlier this year.
[02:15.640 --> 02:22.000]  The Woods have owned the home since 1996 and are wealthy donors to the Baltimore chapter
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.440]  of George Soros' Open Society Institute.
[02:25.440 --> 02:31.200]  Robin is so active that she was made a board member of the far left nonprofit back in 2008
[02:31.200 --> 02:33.800]  according to the OSI's website.
[02:33.800 --> 02:40.640]  Anarchy organizer McKesson essentially resides in a clear example of the supposed white suburbs
[02:40.640 --> 02:45.120]  that the deranged mob in Milwaukee is threatening to burn down.
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.200]  And while the pawns of George Soros do their part to subtly fan the flames of division
[02:50.200 --> 02:56.200]  amongst the brainwashed citizenry of the United States led by a wave of the Chicago chapter
[02:56.200 --> 03:01.400]  of the Revolutionary Communist Party now being largely blamed for the escalation in
[03:01.400 --> 03:07.760]  Milwaukee, George Soros and sons continue to build a trojan horse of jihadist migration
[03:07.760 --> 03:13.240]  embedded refugees aimed squarely at nothing less than unleashing a total disintegration
[03:13.240 --> 03:15.120]  of Western civilization.
[03:15.120 --> 03:20.800]  The Daily Caller reports a leaked memo from left wing financer George Soros' Open Society
[03:20.800 --> 03:27.440]  Foundations argues that Europe's refugee crisis should be accepted as a new normal and that
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.560]  the refugee crisis means new opportunities for Soros' organization to influence immigration
[03:33.560 --> 03:35.520]  policies on a global scale.
[03:35.520 --> 03:41.560]  A section of the review titled Our Work describes how America's least transparent think tank
[03:41.560 --> 03:48.640]  has worked with leaders in the field to shape migration policy making and influence regional
[03:48.640 --> 03:54.280]  and global processes affecting the way migration is governed and enforced.
[03:54.280 --> 04:00.740]  In a section titled Our Ambitions, the authors explain our premise for engaging in work related
[04:00.740 --> 04:05.480]  to governance was that in addition to mitigating the negative effects of enforcement, we should
[04:05.480 --> 04:12.280]  also be supporting actors in the field proactively seeking to change the policies, rules and
[04:12.280 --> 04:18.520]  regulations that govern migration, anarchy at our doorstep fueled by foreign interests,
[04:18.520 --> 04:24.320]  lingering hubris in the White House and a treasonous power hungry menace is one step
[04:24.320 --> 04:27.280]  away from being the next commander in chief.
[04:27.280 --> 04:32.200]  Time to wake up America before you wake up homeless on the continent your father's conquered.
[04:32.200 --> 04:38.400]  You still don't get it do you boys there ain't no countries anymore no more good guys they're
[04:38.400 --> 04:42.600]  running the whole show they own everything the whole damn planet they can do whatever
[04:42.600 --> 04:47.480]  they want what's wrong with having it good for a change and they're gonna let us have
[04:47.480 --> 04:52.520]  a good if we just help them they're gonna leave us alone let us make some money you
[04:52.520 --> 05:01.440]  can have a little taste that good life to John back for everyone's calm stay with us
[05:01.440 --> 05:14.240]  points as reported by Steve Watson the first New York Times piece headline inside the failing
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.840]  mission to tame Trump's tongue insinuated that an ominous sources inside Trump's campaign
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.320]  claim that he is perpetually stolen and erratic the Times said quote the smear piece also
[05:23.320 --> 05:27.600]  claimed that Trump rules about his saring relationship with the news media do you really
[05:27.600 --> 05:31.640]  believe Trump rules about what the discredited failing media thinks about him remember he
[05:31.640 --> 05:36.440]  started attacking the media estate run propaganda not long after he entered the race last year
[05:36.440 --> 05:40.400]  in the second hit piece which is barely worth mentioning claim that Trump campaign chair
[05:40.400 --> 05:45.160]  Paul Manafort has intimate ties with quote politically corrupt pro-cremland elements
[05:45.160 --> 05:48.800]  in Ukraine you mean the same Ukraine that was overthrown by George Soros and Western
[05:48.800 --> 05:52.680]  governments to geopolitically isolate Russia one of the few countries not controlled by
[05:52.680 --> 05:56.440]  the global elite and to find out more about the desperation of the New York Times and
[05:56.440 --> 06:02.160]  establishment media in general visit info wars.com this is Kit Daniels reporting it's

[07:19.520 --> 07:23.200]  to make it and I really want to do a good job on the interview I got my bottle of brain
[07:23.200 --> 07:27.400]  force right there pop two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like being everything

[07:45.840 --> 07:50.760]  I went home about 645 this morning took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain
[07:50.760 --> 07:57.440]  forcing came in you will find a brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com

[08:19.760 --> 08:26.120]  we now take you live to the central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the resistance
[08:26.120 --> 08:37.720]  it's Alex Jones a lot of good news a lot of positive things happening House Republicans
[08:37.720 --> 08:43.560]  pursue perjury charges against Hillary Clinton and they've got the votes to move forward
[08:43.560 --> 08:48.960]  with it if they have the courage this is a big big deal we're gonna be playing several
[08:48.960 --> 08:56.120]  minute clip from those hearings and from those announcements coming up here in just a few
[08:56.120 --> 09:04.080]  minutes we also have Obamacare in big trouble nationally as insurers tire of losing money
[09:04.080 --> 09:10.480]  that's the select insurance companies and aren't the insiders though that wrote the bill
[09:10.480 --> 09:19.440]  we also have obviously massive news dealing with the Trump campaign with the chairman
[09:19.440 --> 09:26.720]  and head of Breitbart Steven Bannon who is a patriot and who is an anti-globalist taking
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.240]  over as the CEO chairman of the entire campaign Paul Manafort who's also been doing a great
[09:32.240 --> 09:38.720]  job is going to be staying on in the position he's at right now this is just an expansion
[09:38.720 --> 09:44.560]  of the campaign in Bannon's own words and in Manafort's own words and I talked to Roger
[09:44.560 --> 09:50.120]  Stone he concurs with that and said that he was also part of the research and trying to
[09:50.120 --> 10:01.000]  bring the head of Breitbart who also heads up the Institute dealing with government corruption
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.880]  and fighting government corruption he's the co-founder executive chairman of government
[10:04.880 --> 10:09.880]  accountability Institute and the executive chairman of Breitbart News LLC you've noticed
[10:09.880 --> 10:14.920]  since he's been running Breitbart it's gotten more hardcore more pro-second amendment not
[10:14.920 --> 10:20.040]  that it was ever bad and really tells it like it is about the true nature of what's happening
[10:20.040 --> 10:25.160]  that this is a globalist new world order takeover program I mean we have the emails from the
[10:25.160 --> 10:31.840]  UN we have the emails from the normal cast of characters like George Soros we know what's
[10:31.840 --> 10:36.840]  going on and just because the old mainstream media calls this conspiracy theorist when
[10:36.840 --> 10:42.280]  we cover facts doesn't mean we should then bow down to them and that's why they're calling
[10:42.280 --> 10:47.960]  him a street fighter a brawler the media is scared of this move because Manafort's pretty
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.000]  hardcore but not compared to Trump obviously you get Stephen Bannon and these other folks
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.720]  that have joined the campaign in there this is really creating a globalist nightmare so
[10:58.720 --> 11:02.880]  we're gonna be breaking that down you've got Roger Ailes unofficially obviously advising
[11:02.880 --> 11:10.360]  on the debates and a lot more so you notice in full wars overall though has made it safe
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.640]  to talk about the new world order to talk about globalism to talk about things that
[11:14.640 --> 11:22.560]  people wouldn't even discuss five years ago and Donald Trump has helped widen the acceptance
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.560]  of reality and so has Matt Drudge and so have you so this is a big victory overall because
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.720]  the the new world order wants to establish this planetary government in the shadows and
[11:32.720 --> 11:38.960]  never have a debate about it no we're going to talk about the TPP we're going to talk
[11:38.960 --> 11:42.560]  about open borders we're going to talk about executive action by the president outside
[11:42.560 --> 11:46.880]  of law where they just open the borders up and make us pay for everybody we're going
[11:46.880 --> 11:54.000]  to discuss our government funding radical orthodox jihadist persecuting Christians
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.720]  worldwide at a rate never before seen even the UN admits the persecution of Christians
[11:59.720 --> 12:04.240]  is double what it's ever been seen and it's our government criminal elements of it that
[12:04.240 --> 12:10.000]  are directing this we are two minutes to midnight as I say every day so all of this is coming
[12:10.000 --> 12:19.920]  up and more first off Obama as usual has more and more egg on his face Stanford University
[12:19.920 --> 12:26.040]  and the Stanford Research Institute that's the university officially itself came out
[12:26.040 --> 12:33.040]  with a big study last week dealing with the fact that there was systemic election fraud
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.280]  at the highest levels across the country stealing the nomination from Bernie Sanders the Hill
[12:38.280 --> 12:46.040]  newspaper covered this yesterday on Monday CBS News ran the headline that there is massive
[12:46.040 --> 12:54.080]  fraud going on across the country both electoral at the top and retail fraud on the bottom
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.160]  the Democratic Party has put out a talking point that it does not exist they've even
[12:58.160 --> 13:03.000]  had seminar callers or train callers calling to talk radio including the show and repeating
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  talking points saying ha ha ha you're crazy it doesn't exist like ha ha ha you know the
[13:08.000 --> 13:13.120]  sun doesn't come up in the morning ha ha ha ha ha ha well next you'll say water is wet
[13:13.120 --> 13:19.840]  ha ha ha ha ha and then try to laugh at you it's not working now this is from Reuters
[13:19.840 --> 13:26.120]  of all places that likes to put out fake polls sampling 15% more Democrats than Republicans
[13:26.120 --> 13:34.000]  to put Hillary 15 points ahead even Reuters is having to admit this US offer states help
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.400]  to fight election hacking I thought there wasn't any such a thing I thought there weren't
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.320]  any HBO documentaries that have congressional testimony where they admit it where the chief
[13:44.320 --> 13:51.560]  guy bold engineers go public and I mean I thought this didn't exist but oh Jay Johnson
[13:51.560 --> 13:57.720]  he's going to come in and make sure there's no fraud and what did Roger Stone say when
[13:57.720 --> 14:04.680]  he joined us on Monday about this he said he'd be concerned about the federal election
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.240]  officials that are going to come in because remember Obama said the feds aren't involved
[14:09.240 --> 14:15.240]  in elections because there's no fraud but he said what is election fraud boy has this
[14:15.240 --> 14:24.240]  blown up in his lion face shows will not be raked what does that mean the federal government
[14:24.240 --> 14:33.520]  doesn't run the election process states and cities and communities all across the country
[14:33.520 --> 14:40.280]  they're the ones who set up the voting systems in the voting booths and if Mr. Trump is suggesting
[14:40.280 --> 14:51.840]  that there is a conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country including
[14:51.840 --> 15:02.280]  in places like Texas where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting
[15:02.280 --> 15:07.040]  booths that's ridiculous that doesn't make any sense and I don't think anybody would
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.960]  take that serious okay so we're talking about national election fraud battleground states
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.960]  so we didn't say we thought the Democrats were going to steal the election in Texas we
[15:18.960 --> 15:24.040]  said Trump has internal polling that they do scientifically to really see what's happening
[15:24.040 --> 15:29.320]  where he is at a dead heat in places like California and seven to 12 points ahead in Florida and
[15:29.320 --> 15:33.520]  five to ten points depending on which poll they do and other real scientific polls show
[15:33.520 --> 15:37.440]  this than is in the news that you know he's he's five to ten points ahead in places like
[15:37.440 --> 15:45.440]  Ohio it varies the point is when you see the news saying Hillary's got a 10 15 or 20 two
[15:45.440 --> 15:53.760]  point lead you better believe that is a load of horse pucky but just think about that clip
[15:53.760 --> 16:01.560]  the feds aren't involved in elections not true they let the media six secretive groups
[16:01.560 --> 16:07.760]  announce it formerly voter news services now it's the election pool services and then
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.880]  Edison services I mean every few months they're changing the name now and that's the group
[16:13.880 --> 16:20.160]  that announced California for Bernie Sanders the day before in a meeting they had according
[16:20.160 --> 16:24.480]  to the Associated Press it reported on itself the AP runs it and then they go oh we're calling
[16:24.480 --> 16:30.200]  it for Sanders because the super delegates are going to go for Hillary we're calling
[16:30.200 --> 16:38.200]  it against Sanders so you have Obama saying the feds aren't involved but now they are
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.120]  involved to come in and make sure hacks don't happen oh they're going to have a little computer
[16:43.120 --> 16:48.280]  technicians a little specialist hooked up to our local voting machines to make sure everything's
[16:48.280 --> 16:55.760]  running okay that's never happened before when you see manipulated elections the feds will
[16:55.760 --> 17:03.200]  meet in shadowy mansions with the major donors and super delegates and they'll try to call
[17:03.200 --> 17:07.120]  it for somebody else before the polls close and then there'll be a whole election fight
[17:07.120 --> 17:13.200]  over it that's how this situation has been in the past but this is now blowing up in
[17:13.200 --> 17:19.400]  Obama's face because he is saying that the feds aren't involved in the election process
[17:19.400 --> 17:24.600]  but now here they are saying they are going to be involved in it and that's been our big
[17:24.600 --> 17:30.800]  fear quite frankly behind the scenes was that if you heard that they were going to send
[17:30.800 --> 17:38.440]  the feds in to administer the elections and to hook into the computers the Justice Department
[17:38.440 --> 17:44.680]  the same ones that are no billing Hillary Clinton the same ones that are letting us be sold out
[17:44.680 --> 17:50.840]  the communist Chinese the same ones that illegally ignore the Supreme Court and the law and advertise
[17:50.840 --> 17:54.880]  for the illegal aliens to come here and be loaded on buses and then shipped into the
[17:54.880 --> 18:01.080]  United States to be signed up as democratic party clients the same ones that are going
[18:01.080 --> 18:06.160]  after the second amendment extra judicially extra legislatively outside of law the same
[18:06.160 --> 18:10.240]  ones that are engaged in all these different types of criminal activities the same Justice
[18:10.240 --> 18:15.640]  Department that allows hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[18:15.640 --> 18:22.600]  billions in total to flood the Clinton Foundation and we even have the emails where they give
[18:22.600 --> 18:28.200]  the money and say now get me a meeting with this person from the State Department on Z
[18:28.200 --> 18:37.480]  or a issue amazing so now the corrupt Justice Department legendarily corrupt nakedly corrupt
[18:37.480 --> 18:48.080]  brazenly corrupt dripping with Hutzpah dripping with bravada dripping with arrogance U.S.

[24:10.440 --> 24:20.600]  overall head of the trump campaign it is now steven bannon and that guy is even more vicious
[24:20.600 --> 24:26.520]  than trump when it comes to going up against the new world order now this is really i think good news
[24:26.520 --> 24:33.480]  overall and again it's just an expansion of the campaign because trump in the last 83 days 82 days
[24:33.480 --> 24:41.080]  now until the election is putting brass knuckles on he took the gloves off about a month ago brass
[24:41.080 --> 24:49.400]  knuckles are now going on and you're going to see spectacular events he is going to savage the living
[24:49.400 --> 24:54.120]  daylights out of hillary clinton during the debates in fact i i think she'll probably have a seizure
[24:54.120 --> 24:58.200]  i'm serious right there on the spot she can't even handle someone questioning her she's so
[24:58.200 --> 25:05.880]  psychotic you question her she blows up she can't handle anything and by the way i've been
[25:05.880 --> 25:11.560]  covering the clinton's for 21 years i've probably interviewed more clinton insiders than anybody
[25:12.680 --> 25:17.880]  and i mean i'm telling you we're not putting hype out there against hillary she is bad news
[25:17.880 --> 25:23.720]  which political science professor trump has an 87 chance of winning the election
[25:25.160 --> 25:31.240]  he has never been wrong about one of these elections he's also applied the algorithm
[25:33.400 --> 25:40.120]  back to elections earlier in the last century and found it's very very accurate political science
[25:40.120 --> 25:46.040]  professor helmut northpole whose election model is accurately predicted the outcome of the popular
[25:46.040 --> 25:50.920]  vote five times in a row asserts that donald trump has an 87 chance of winning he by the way he's
[25:50.920 --> 25:55.560]  nonpartisan the presidency appearing on fox business with lou dobbs you think this should
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.640]  be on fox cnn but no they don't want you know this norpeth said the forecast confounded the poll
[26:01.640 --> 26:07.480]  numbers let's go ahead and play that interview or a clip from that interview the story is on
[26:07.480 --> 26:12.680]  info wars dot com we need to get it out to everyone you know it's a paul joseph watch an article
[26:12.680 --> 26:18.040]  it's got other polls and other numbers showing uh why we think trump is going to win uh usa today
[26:18.040 --> 26:23.640]  app maker trump will win election that's what the real numbers polls are so old-fashioned folks who's
[26:23.640 --> 26:29.000]  gotten in lines everybody knows this they target certain demographics certain phone numbers where
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.880]  they know the response they're going to get on average it's staged there's real internal poll
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.520]  and it's very accurate but then there's the bologna polls that create the perception trump's losing
[26:38.520 --> 26:42.840]  and it's having an effect to a certain extent it's gotten weak-minded people to buy into it but
[26:42.840 --> 26:48.520]  let's get to that clip joining me now helmet norpeth political science professor at stony
[26:48.520 --> 26:53.800]  brook university in new york professor good to have you back with us i just want to tell everybody
[26:53.800 --> 27:02.920]  back in marge uh the professor projected his model projected an 87 chance that donald trump
[27:02.920 --> 27:09.480]  would win the election we've come a ways since then what does your model suggest now the same thing
[27:10.600 --> 27:17.160]  still 87 chance of winning yes despite all of the the naysayers and the negative noise
[27:17.160 --> 27:22.520]  that we see in the national media unrelenting attacks on donald trump from every quarter
[27:22.520 --> 27:28.840]  still 87 percent well that's that's what the model says and i know that uh if you look at uh
[27:28.840 --> 27:35.400]  polls right now that's not what uh polls are saying and uh but polls are about what
[27:35.400 --> 27:39.560]  how people feel today yeah and the election is not in front of the people we're asking
[27:39.560 --> 27:46.440]  themselves right now you know just how accurate is professor norpeth's model how accurate has it
[27:46.440 --> 27:52.840]  been in elections over time well i started this in uh 1996 uh did the did the first forecast
[27:52.840 --> 27:59.560]  in that year then i've done it for the last five election presidential election years and the model
[27:59.560 --> 28:06.440]  has predicted the winner of the popular vote correctly each time each time i mean that's
[28:06.440 --> 28:13.560]  that's extraordinary and uh and of course with the exception of 2000 uh i i don't know how you
[28:13.560 --> 28:19.560]  judge that some people say that he uh you know how do you evaluate that one year well it's a tricky
[28:19.560 --> 28:25.000]  one but that was for all of us well that's that's why i said predicted the popular vote so the model
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.600]  predicts the popular vote in that election year it does not predict that uh george bush would
[28:30.600 --> 28:36.280]  end up uh being president i think it's it's it's pretty likely this year based on the way things
[28:36.280 --> 28:42.120]  are set up uh with the advantage really to the democrats and electorally that the winner of
[28:42.120 --> 28:47.960]  the popular vote will likely be the winner so you still you're still confident in your poll
[28:47.960 --> 28:52.680]  well it takes a lot it takes a very close election for this to happen that there's a mismatch so
[28:53.720 --> 28:58.840]  something like there you go ladies and gentlemen a lot of folks wonder why some of these uh videos
[28:58.840 --> 29:04.920]  we grab off youtube uh are shot off a television that's because it beats the bots there's these
[29:04.920 --> 29:09.080]  bots out there claiming you know copyright on stuff and and that's how folks do that is they'll
[29:09.080 --> 29:13.240]  shoot video right off a computer screen and that beats the bots you know how we beat the bots
[29:13.240 --> 29:20.120]  it's fair use we're showing a small clip giving attribution and then giving our political analysis
[29:20.120 --> 29:25.080]  and cultural analysis of it and i've researched this poll going back several elections uh this
[29:25.080 --> 29:30.120]  guy just gets more and more accurate each time he uh is proven correct and that's what the social
[29:30.120 --> 29:35.160]  media mass numbers are showing that's what all the real app numbers are showing where they've
[29:35.160 --> 29:39.640]  got real back in stuff and what people are really clicking what they're really doing real decisions
[29:39.640 --> 29:45.480]  they're making that's how amazon can predict what you're going to order days before you order it
[29:45.480 --> 29:50.760]  remember that so see they know trumps really ahead that's why they're panicking so much and
[29:50.760 --> 29:57.480]  getting ready to try to steal it the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:57.480 --> 30:07.480]  network talk about convenient timing the obama administration is dead set on handing over american

[30:37.720 --> 30:42.600]  opponents have made the case that congress has passed legislation to prohibit the federal government
[30:42.600 --> 30:47.560]  from using tax dollars to allow this transition they point out that the feds are constitutionally
[30:47.560 --> 30:53.160]  prohibited from transferring federal property without approval from congress a coalition of 25
[30:53.160 --> 30:58.040]  advocacy groups have issued a separate statement calling for congress to sue in the event the

[33:27.160 --> 33:36.600]  all right this story went up yesterday on info wars dot com and to their credit drudge had a link
[33:36.600 --> 33:40.440]  i think to a bright bar story uh on the same topic in world that daily covered it in daily
[33:40.440 --> 33:47.320]  caller that was basically about it and again it's a scary thought when the house is moving
[33:48.120 --> 33:54.040]  to have perjury charges on hillary she's clearly been caught lying the fbis being blackmailed or
[33:54.040 --> 33:59.640]  lord knows what won't take action on admitted crime bill clinton in fact we played this clip on sunday
[33:59.640 --> 34:07.400]  but can you guys cue it up i want to play that first where bill clinton says the fbi director
[34:07.400 --> 34:16.200]  statement is full of bull hillary has been caught red-handed the fbi director had to admit she'd
[34:16.200 --> 34:20.760]  been caught red-handed but that he couldn't get prosecutors to go after her because the way the
[34:20.760 --> 34:26.440]  case had been handled okay whatever you got bill clinton running on airplanes meeting with the
[34:26.440 --> 34:34.600]  attorney general totally illegal the attorney general should step down immediately and this
[34:34.600 --> 34:39.880]  arrogant creature is now shooting his mouth off we're going to get to this in a moment i'm going
[34:39.880 --> 34:45.400]  to have a don salazar's article reposted to the front of info wars dot com and i'm going to ask
[34:45.400 --> 34:51.240]  the nightly news to cover this and i'm going to hammer this all week long if we get real hearings
[34:51.240 --> 34:57.320]  going and they move forward with perjury charges against her this will bring her down and and
[34:57.320 --> 35:02.200]  people say oh well it's an election don't try to foil it by sending her to jail that'd be like
[35:02.200 --> 35:07.640]  saying if she was drunk driving and ran over a little kid in front of 20 people and then she
[35:07.640 --> 35:13.960]  doesn't get charged because she's running for president she has to be charged and if the grand
[35:13.960 --> 35:20.680]  juries and the fbi and everybody else are too scared to do it then congress seems to do it and
[35:20.680 --> 35:26.200]  right now that's why i wanted to get bob bar because he's the guy that moved forward say
[35:26.200 --> 35:31.800]  what you want about bob bar he wasn't even tea party enough for the tea party bob bar wasn't
[35:31.800 --> 35:36.120]  perfect but when it came to the second amendment and going after criminals and going after chinese
[35:36.120 --> 35:43.160]  spies and stuff he's awesome and he got cheated in georgia no doubt uh the way they've gerrymandered
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.640]  that and the and the way that uh the republican establishment tricked the tea party to go after
[35:47.640 --> 35:53.080]  him and i'm not against who
[35:53.080 --> 36:00.600]  won it's just very frustrated because if you had a bob bar he would be moving forward this
[36:00.600 --> 36:09.160]  right now and it would happen but we are very very very very close right now so i'm gonna get to
[36:09.160 --> 36:17.800]  that the moment first off i am doing a living defense cleanse right now from the smallest
[36:17.800 --> 36:26.840]  parasites the largest it has dozens and dozens and dozens of ancient known from the wives tales to
[36:26.840 --> 36:33.000]  you know to science herbs and plant extracts that are known to knock out parasites that's why one
[36:33.000 --> 36:40.200]  of the chief ones is wormwood concentrated organic wildcrafted black walnut green hole
[36:42.040 --> 36:45.880]  you know the native americans would take green hole black walnuts soak them in water
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.880]  once a year and everybody would drink it because the medicine man said get rid of the worms i mean
[36:49.880 --> 36:59.000]  it's known this is the way to do it organic wormwood a clove bud it just goes on and on i'm not
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.880]  going to mention the it's got to be 30 something ingredients in here the reason this sells out
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.400]  for months and months once for six months is he is trying to source all of this and have each
[37:09.400 --> 37:14.120]  ingredient tested and try to have it at california standards which everybody's heard about
[37:15.960 --> 37:19.560]  are so high almost no one can pass it that's why a lot of times you hear supplement ads and they
[37:19.560 --> 37:26.840]  say not available in california because the lawyer's got laws passed there where there's more lead in
[37:26.840 --> 37:34.360]  the air than you can have in supplements in california and it is so hard to find batches of
[37:34.360 --> 37:41.560]  things that are that clean so that's why some of these products we have like dna force uh or
[37:42.280 --> 37:50.920]  products like living defense harmful organic cleansing harmful organism cleansing dietary
[37:50.920 --> 37:56.040]  supplement that's why it's so hard to keep these in stock it will sell out by the end of the week
[37:56.040 --> 38:00.040]  the good news is we should get more in by the end of the month we're getting better on our supply
[38:00.040 --> 38:05.880]  pipeline and it's your purchases of these products that makes this whole show possible but i'm telling
[38:05.880 --> 38:12.680]  you for my overall health it's amazing for my children you name it dr group says you should
[38:12.680 --> 38:19.160]  probably do a cleanse twice a year so you're talking about a bottle once a year for each person in

[38:25.160 --> 38:31.080]  the energy the stamina it's it's not just that it's bad for the harmful organisms it just does
[38:31.640 --> 38:37.320]  so much for you when you don't have and most people have them harmful organisms in your
[38:37.320 --> 38:42.920]  gut that are putting out toxins that's a nice way of putting it they're using the restroom in your
[38:42.920 --> 38:49.960]  guts and it's it's linked to a lot of people's allergies headaches the list goes on and on
[38:49.960 --> 38:57.720]  the point is deworming yourself is pretty darn important and i personally go the way of nature
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.480]  and you've got all these third world populations pouring in all the stuff that's happening
[39:04.840 --> 39:08.920]  the police the border patrol should do when they let folks in that have all these different

[40:47.160 --> 40:53.720]  people it is showing your solidarity with liberty and it's showing everybody how powerful info wars
[40:53.720 --> 41:03.880]  exist because of the tens of millions of listeners we have when tens of thousands of you go out at
[41:03.880 --> 41:12.600]  public events and at hillary events or at trump events you are showing that this information
[41:13.160 --> 41:22.440]  really is the popular dominant truthful political cosmology of the republic and all we're doing is
[41:22.440 --> 41:29.720]  going back and restoring common sense values that made this nation the apple of the world's eye
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.680]  the globalists can criticize america cherry picked bad examples of things that happened
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.960]  here and lord knows they did but no one can deny the fact that everybody wanted to come here and
[41:41.960 --> 41:50.680]  we were the most inventive the most hard-working the most diverse culturally and that we were
[41:50.680 --> 41:55.240]  something special but the new world order can't compete with the american system so it wants to
[41:55.240 --> 42:01.160]  bring it down while it uses the blood sweat and tears and ingenuity and smarts and toughness of
[42:01.160 --> 42:06.520]  this republic what's left of it to build its planetary corporate world government and we're
[42:06.520 --> 42:15.000]  saying no and the talking point that americanism not globalism will be our credo our maxim comes
[42:15.000 --> 42:25.720]  from info wars i have taken classic americana paleo conservative classical liberal renaissance
[42:25.720 --> 42:33.480]  1776 ideas and simply put them out in a no-holds barred street fighter
[42:34.200 --> 42:41.080]  brass knuckled presentation because that's what it is soros has been caught in his own emails hell
[42:41.080 --> 42:46.120]  he's proud of it though financing the jihadi invasion and financing groups to go out the
[42:46.120 --> 42:51.880]  media and target folks that are exposing the jihad invasion he's the one getting laws passed in
[42:51.880 --> 42:57.480]  europe and bragging about it to arrest people he's the one working with zucker burg and hillary and
[42:57.480 --> 43:04.440]  obama to go out the free speech this guy's a tyrant and the answer to that is to get hardcore
[43:04.440 --> 43:10.360]  with these people and take the gloves off put the brass knuckles on because they're taking a hatchet
[43:10.360 --> 43:19.000]  to us yes it's extreme to say george soros is a globalist criminal trying to overthrow the country
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.240]  he admits it he does it to countless other nations and by countless because it's ongoing in a whole
[43:25.240 --> 43:28.840]  bunch of countries right now he's trying to overthrow admittedly more than 10 countries and
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.920]  bragging about it right now he just runs around overthrowing everything he's a Rothschild front
[43:32.920 --> 43:38.920]  man it's all funny to these people it's not funny to me and i'm not going to see the the
[43:38.920 --> 43:44.840]  republic overthrown our guns taken families broken up the tax situation set up where families are
[43:44.840 --> 43:52.200]  basically made obsolete with weaponized gangster culture media being spewed at everyone all i'm
[43:52.200 --> 44:00.200]  doing is fighting back for my life i understand our way of life and common sense and decency
[44:00.200 --> 44:05.480]  is under attack and i'm not rolling over for it what about you let me get to the really good
[44:05.480 --> 44:16.280]  news now that i started to mention we now see obama coming out in the last few weeks and saying
[44:16.280 --> 44:21.720]  election fraud what's that but then a stanford research institute comes out and says election
[44:21.720 --> 44:28.680]  fraud is massive you stole the election from uh bernie sanders helery as cbs news comes out this
[44:28.680 --> 44:37.560]  week and says yes election fraud is just absolutely massive a huge problem cbs news as we have a former
[44:37.560 --> 44:43.480]  cbs reporter sharyl akinson coming out and looking at all these big national polls and she's putting
[44:43.480 --> 44:49.400]  out investigative reports proving their frauds we have the justice department now that's not
[44:49.400 --> 44:53.480]  supposedly involved in elections saying they're going to be coming and monitoring the elections
[44:53.480 --> 44:58.280]  and monitoring the computers and of course hooking up to them and keep battling around states
[44:58.280 --> 45:01.960]  to make sure everything runs right talk about a fox in the henhouse
[45:05.160 --> 45:08.520]  and that's executive roger stone said on monday we got to get stoned on about this
[45:08.520 --> 45:14.040]  today or tomorrow he said i would be watching for the federal watchers who they deny are going to
[45:14.040 --> 45:18.600]  be there well now they're going to be there the same ones that made sure with the mainstream media
[45:18.600 --> 45:25.320]  to announce bernie sanders lost now let's move to the big enchilada they're panicking because as i
[45:25.320 --> 45:29.800]  mentioned earlier political science professor who's never been wrong with his algorithm in the last
[45:29.800 --> 45:37.880]  six uh elections trump has 87 chance of winning the election this is usa today
[45:39.160 --> 45:44.280]  appmaker trump will win election because they actually see who is in there by the hundreds of
[45:44.280 --> 45:49.000]  thousands of users a day and what they're clicking on and what they're supporting and it's trump and
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.520]  they have the demographics to know just like amazon with over a billion customers ladies and
[45:54.520 --> 45:58.920]  gentlemen two years ago said we can already with customers that are on our side every day
[45:59.640 --> 46:05.480]  with our advanced customers we can predict within 99 plus accuracy what you're going to buy
[46:05.480 --> 46:10.440]  days or hours before you buy it so we already have it packaged and waiting for you when you order it
[46:10.440 --> 46:14.680]  remember that type that in if you don't believe me you're a new listener this sounds unbelievable
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.640]  amazon has your order ready before you order it and knows what you're going to order now if they
[46:19.640 --> 46:26.360]  know that they really know who is ahead the whole system is against trump because they know he's a
[46:26.360 --> 46:32.280]  populace they're scared of him they don't control him and that ties into social media patterns show
[46:32.280 --> 46:36.600]  trump is looking at a landslide victory again those are just some of the articles the last few days
[46:36.600 --> 46:41.720]  there's the wall street journal amazon wants to ship your package before you buy it and then they go
[46:41.720 --> 46:47.560]  into the fact that they can already do it again two years ago boom see i have a memory all of you
[46:47.560 --> 46:53.800]  could have a memory this good but they train us not to have one people hear me just spew all the
[46:53.800 --> 46:57.640]  simple thing all that guy's making that up how could he know all that and just spew it out
[46:58.200 --> 47:05.000]  because i live this this is what i do and trump is smart to get the head of right bar to be a
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.800]  chief advisor now because this is a street war this is an internet war he trump knows where to
[47:09.800 --> 47:17.880]  get advice and i'm gonna leave it right there okay let's continue here to the big enchilada now
[47:17.880 --> 47:21.960]  this is getting almost no attention i wanted red link back to the front page of info wars.com it
[47:21.960 --> 47:28.520]  went up yesterday house republicans pursue perjury charges against hillary congressman press doj to
[47:28.520 --> 47:35.880]  act on evidence showing hillary willfully lied during sworn testimony adan salazar wrote the
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.120]  article members of the house oversight committee judiciary committee are pointing out evidence
[47:40.120 --> 47:45.320]  taken directly from sworn testimony which may lead to perjury charges against democrat presidential
[47:45.320 --> 47:51.880]  candidate hillary clinton republican jason chevitz a judiciary committee chairman bob uh bob good
[47:51.880 --> 47:58.360]  latte i pronounced that right penned a letter to u.s attorney for the district of columbia
[47:58.360 --> 48:04.600]  presenting key evidence of information showing clinton willfully lied during the october 22nd
[48:04.600 --> 48:10.920]  in 2015 interrogation regarding the mingazi debacle in which she also answered questions
[48:10.920 --> 48:16.600]  concerning her illegal private email server let's go ahead and go to this clip
[48:19.800 --> 48:26.600]  where were hillary's statements false there was nothing marked classified on my emails either
[48:26.600 --> 48:31.960]  sent or received nothing was marked classified at the time i sent or received it i think it's
[48:31.960 --> 48:37.720]  also important to say something about the marking of classified information only a very small number
[48:37.720 --> 48:43.000]  of the emails here containing classified information or markings that indicated the presence of
[48:43.000 --> 48:50.040]  classified information but even if information is not more classified in an email participants who
[48:50.040 --> 48:55.480]  know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect
[48:55.480 --> 49:01.560]  i but i'm asking how i'm asking how it was done was that did someone physically look at the 62 000
[49:01.560 --> 49:07.240]  emails or did you use search terms date parameters i want to know the specifics they did all of that
[49:07.240 --> 49:13.560]  they also went through every single email lawyers doing the sorting for secretary clinton in 2014
[49:13.560 --> 49:19.080]  did not individually read the content of all of her emails as we did for those available to us
[49:20.120 --> 49:24.680]  instead they relied on header information and they use search terms to try to find
[49:24.680 --> 49:30.200]  all work-related emails among the reportedly more than 60 000 that were remaining on her system at
[49:30.200 --> 49:37.480]  the end of 2014 it's highly likely that their search missed some work-related emails and that
[49:37.480 --> 49:43.720]  we later found them for example in the mailboxes of other officials or in the slack space of a server
[49:43.720 --> 49:50.760]  there were two servers no there was a server on just one and so there's only one server is that
[49:50.760 --> 49:55.880]  where you're telling me and it's the one server that the fbi has the fbi has the server that was
[49:55.880 --> 50:01.400]  used during the tenure of my uh state department service secretary clinton used several different
[50:01.400 --> 50:06.440]  servers and administrators of those servers during her four years at the state department
[50:07.320 --> 50:13.640]  and she also used numerous mobile devices to send and to read email on that personal domain
[50:14.280 --> 50:20.200]  as new servers and equipment were employed older servers were taken out of service stored and
[50:20.200 --> 50:26.920]  decommissioned in various ways i provided the uh department which has been providing you with all
[50:26.920 --> 50:33.960]  of my work-related emails all that i had the fbi also discovered several thousand work-related
[50:33.960 --> 50:40.440]  emails that were not among the group of 30 000 emails returned by secretary clinton to state in
[50:40.440 --> 50:46.680]  2014 it's also likely that there are other work-related emails that they did not produce to state
[50:46.680 --> 50:52.040]  and that we did not find elsewhere and that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did
[50:52.040 --> 50:58.120]  not produce to state and the lawyers then clean their devices in such a way as to conclude complete
[50:58.120 --> 51:04.360]  friends and coworkers that is oversight a government reform committee established in
[51:04.360 --> 51:10.600]  1816 oversight.house.gov uh so now we've got the house of representatives so desperate
[51:10.600 --> 51:17.480]  it's having to put out little three minute blurbs showing where she lied i mean it came
[51:17.480 --> 51:23.160]  she used to say she didn't have private email remember the head of the EPA had to step down
[51:23.160 --> 51:29.320]  because she got caught doing that they do this to get around foyer and freedom information act
[51:29.320 --> 51:34.600]  they do this to keep stuff secret they do this to make crimes that's why it's a crime what she did
[51:34.600 --> 51:39.400]  just to have it separately is a crime then she would order them to cut the classified part
[51:39.400 --> 51:46.520]  off the top just altering a secret document is a felony and then she lies to congress and says
[51:46.520 --> 51:51.080]  she never sent or received secret documents even though we have her ordering them to do so
[51:53.080 --> 51:59.240]  and there's 30 something thousand of a missing lying lying lying lying lying and now
[52:03.080 --> 52:08.440]  we have the republicans the judiciary committee chairman and others pending a letter to the US
[52:08.440 --> 52:13.720]  attorney for the district of columbia presenting key pieces of information showing clinton willfully
[52:13.720 --> 52:20.200]  lied during the october 22nd 2015 investigation investigation and interrogation and they need
[52:20.200 --> 52:26.200]  to move forward with congressional hearings on the perjury a representative for the justice
[52:26.200 --> 52:30.360]  department responded to the request august 2nd this is going on for weeks saying they would
[52:30.360 --> 52:36.840]  take appropriate action as necessary however no timeline was offered as they run the clock
[52:36.840 --> 52:43.080]  you can't it's loretta lynch on accompanying video asked where's hillary clinton's statement
[52:43.080 --> 52:48.440]  false we're also recently uploaded to the committee an oversight and government reform we just
[52:48.440 --> 52:53.640]  played it from youtube comparing clinton's testimony with statements fbi director james
[52:53.640 --> 52:59.880]  comey made well forget what comey said he's telling the truth there it's what is admitted in the
[52:59.880 --> 53:05.960]  emails and the fact she changed her story over and over again in their letter the congressman
[53:05.960 --> 53:11.640]  point out clinton misled congress when she said she had not handled classified information
[53:11.640 --> 53:16.680]  secretary clinton stated there was nothing marked classified on the emails either sent or received
[53:16.680 --> 53:23.320]  the letter to the us attorney reads but clinton's comments are contrasts of fbi director comey's
[53:23.320 --> 53:27.880]  july 5th announcement and when she said a very small number of emails contained classified
[53:27.880 --> 53:33.400]  information and they bore the markings they got lazy uh indicating the presence of classified
[53:33.400 --> 53:47.000]  information so the question is where does this go retired assistant fbi director steven pomerance
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.760]  said a decision to pursue perjury charges given the weight of the evidence should take mere weeks
[53:53.320 --> 54:00.520]  yes it's open and shut you testify in court that you didn't steal your neighbor's red pickup truck
[54:00.520 --> 54:04.760]  on said day and that you were somewhere else that you were say fishing in another county
[54:05.400 --> 54:10.680]  he has surveillance footage the court then has shown of you stealing the red pickup you don't
[54:10.680 --> 54:20.120]  just get convicted of grand theft auto you get convicted of perjury open and shut open and shut
[54:22.360 --> 54:27.800]  the question is will they now take action and do something about this house republicans pursue
[54:27.800 --> 54:31.720]  perjury charges against clinton they're not just trying to subpoena her again they're not just
[54:31.720 --> 54:36.680]  calling it perjury they have written letters weeks ago we're just now learning about this
[54:36.680 --> 54:43.240]  saying we want perjury charges we have her open and shut and senior fbi agents are coming out
[54:43.240 --> 54:50.920]  saying yes that is exactly what you have here open and shut perjury open and shut cut and dry
[54:50.920 --> 54:57.640]  caught red-handed meanwhile though bill clinton thinks it's all funny oh you think it's illegal for
[54:57.640 --> 55:03.080]  me to go meet while i'm under criminal investigation for the foundation and for the emails my wife is
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.160]  you think it's uh improper for me to go get on her airplane to meet weather for what is it 45
[55:07.160 --> 55:13.320]  minutes or whatever we just talked about sports then the next week the fbi director came out and
[55:13.320 --> 55:18.280]  looked like he saw a ghost and said we'd done a lot of bad stuff but nobody would stand up against us
[55:18.280 --> 55:23.000]  well you know what i have to say about him here's what i have to say about the fbi director first
[55:23.000 --> 55:32.200]  of all with the fbi director the first of all the fbi director said when he testified before
[55:32.200 --> 55:39.640]  congress he had to amend his previous day statement that she had never received any emails
[55:39.640 --> 55:47.320]  or classified they saw two little notes with a c on it this is the biggest multiple i've ever heard
[55:47.320 --> 55:54.680]  that were about telephone calls that she needed to make and the state department typically puts
[55:54.680 --> 56:00.440]  a little c on it to destroy these people from discussing it in public in the event the secretary
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.000]  of state whoever it is doesn't make a telephone call does that sound threatening to the national
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.280]  security you i'm not f6 but i don't have six of that woman and now we did give what we let

[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.840]  an expansion of the campaign and there's no bad blood i have confirmed that there's there just
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:04.760]  bringing on more people that are super media savvy and this new lady they brought in has already been
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:10.040]  working on the campaign and it seems that uh she is able to keep trump for whatever reason he likes
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:18.280]  her on message so that's what's going on and he also was known trump for a long long time
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:24.440]  there's another article out here how bloomberg spun its own poll data to make hillary clinton
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:31.560]  seem inevitable we've got so much that i'm going to be going over here today uh he's going to be
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.120]  in the studio next week i got my wires crossed steve quill who want to get on more and more for
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:40.840]  commentary uh is going to be on the phone with us for an hour then we're going to have a reporters
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.360]  pop in uh who are still up in um wisconsin they covered the trump rally they covered some of the
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:52.360]  riots and burning and death that went on up there with the whole just department run operation
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:02:01.720]  uh and paul watson will be hosting the fourth hour with some big guests as well from london england um
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.640]  i want to get to the michael more situation just briefly when we come back and we'll go to steve
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:13.480]  quill because i don't have time in this segment but it goes to the deception when you're looking
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:20.360]  at the news from six in the morning until midnight when you're constantly checking the latest news
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:27.400]  feeds you see the patterns anybody can just barely pay attention they keep saying his candidacy isn't
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:36.920]  real they keep saying he's a fraud they keep saying donald trump is really a democrat donald
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:45.000]  trump just wanted to get a better tv deal and we see this over and over again donald trump
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:53.160]  is completely for real and donald trump knows his name his treasure his credibility is all
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:59.720]  the line it's been estimated even by cnn he's lost 200 million dollars from boycotts and losing tv
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:06.200]  deals and and losing his beauty pageants and all of it trump decided to really go with his instincts
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:14.760]  these had for 30 years against globalism and trump is friends with people like bannon who's
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.840]  who at bright bart is is you know fighting the new world order now and joining drudge and myself
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:33.240]  and others in reality so believe me trump is a ultra historic figure here and the reason they're
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:40.600]  attacking is credibility and and saying he's not real saying that he's lying to everyone is because
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.920]  they're the fakes the globalist are let me tell you donald trump's for real folks
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.920]  donald trump's for real
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.120]  and i don't say this to brag because the media already knows this i could say it
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.240]  i can have a conversation with donald trump and then get information to him and a day later he's
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.000]  on the podium talking about election fraud now they're trying to steal it and now you got stanford
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.960]  research institute you've got all these big think tanks you've got leftist professors saying yes they
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.040]  do steal elections yes they're trying to steal it they've got all these fake polls out and they've
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:18.360]  got this unified fraud now notice in fact cue this up we can from from two weeks ago when he was on

[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:30.440]  ahead trumps gonna win i'm i'm out there across the country with blue collar folks uh he's gonna win
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.320]  we better do something just to show his duplicitousness now he comes out and says
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:45.720]  trumps completely fake i i talked to him yeah yeah he told me so you lying sack of evil
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.080]  you are unbelievable it's just like what i was on bbc once on this big morning show and i walk off
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:57.560]  and they go he said during the break it's all fake and luckily i've been rolling video and and it

[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.960]  marshaling the troops warning the people about what's happening just to give the tv viewers
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.840]  and listeners a microcosm of what other soldiers of liberty are doing now seven days a week people
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.800]  like gary haven's worth a couple billion dollars and he is just putting massive amounts of that
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:46.600]  anyway he can to warn the people and steve quayle is working tirelessly and and and so many others
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:52.120]  and people say why do you praise roger so much or why are you praising you know bannon of bright bar
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:10:01.240]  uh because i see how hardcore they're getting and i see the courage they have and in a world of cowards
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:10.040]  patriots are just larger than life heroes and the globalist hold up basketball players or hockey
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:16.520]  players as gods or you know felps as a god and i think felps is amazing it's an example of you know
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.520]  human determination you said you know good clean guy too but the point is is that that's not who
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:30.440]  the real role models are for kids just 70 years ago it was inventors trailblazers uh quite frankly
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:36.840]  gunfighters uh it was it was the toughest of the tough it was it was coal miners and we have to get
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:42.120]  back to that it was it was the right brothers at kitty hawk that's what made us so great
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:48.840]  decadent corrupt nations historically become totally obsessed with sports and gambling
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:57.400]  and mock gambling and mock sports simulation fantasy football the next level with video games
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:04.920]  and virtual reality and all the rest of it and then it goes from there into sexual perversion
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:10.760]  and then it goes into sexual identity falling apart this is a cycle that professors have talked
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:17.000]  about for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years camille paglia has popularized it in some
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.240]  books she's written about it that are historical and very accurate uh that i read back when i was a
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:28.040]  teenager but the point is is it's there and we are in the middle of the swing into the most
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:34.680]  decadent dangerous time this planet's ever seen because here's here's the sad part it's one thing
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:41.400]  if the germans are running around you know it's transsexuals in the 1920s and then you get hitler
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:49.080]  it's the war that comes out of it you see next comes the collapse the poverty the giant wars
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.560]  in the cycle every time you're like well so what have we got people running around in dresses
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.920]  why frankly as long as you don't try to teach it to my kids or whatever you want to go often you
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.760]  know think you're a dog or think you're a five-year-old or whatever that's your issue we used to call
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:11.560]  that mental illness be free but the fact is you're a bellwether a canary in the coal mine
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:17.160]  now i want to go to our guest who i'd love to get him on once a week and do it and and
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.240]  basically co-host with me and give his analysis on what's happening and when he's in studio next
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.680]  week i want to get uh partially you know into uh his new film and uh why the globals are so obsessed
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:32.760]  with the occult but there's an alternate article out by michael moore that fits into a larger cosmology
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:38.920]  a fake world view that donald trump's really a democrat that donald trump is just doing this
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:46.120]  to become more famous that donald trump uh wanted a bigger contract with television
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.520]  and you read this article it's the definition of slime they keep saying he's gonna resign he's gonna
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:57.080]  resign it's all fake then they mix into this i saw it on cnm this morning something was true
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.480]  trump for a decade is one to start his own fox news and he's toyed with it he wants to counter
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.800]  what's going on in this country they've now had a coup and kicked out roger ailes for basically
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.800]  made up reasons they admitted to coup they're going way globalist not left globalist right now
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:22.280]  so when you look at this you have to understand they're creating the perception that he's a liar
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.280]  he's not for real he doesn't mean what he says and again you go watch the footage and when i was
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.000]  on that big sunday morning show it's the biggest in the country i forget the name of it mcbrain
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.440]  knows the names he did a uh little short piece about it and i'm there like four years ago to cover
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.160]  bill berg and i go in and i start saying hey they're you know they're attacking us there is a world
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:45.720]  government fluorine the water's hurting you don't laugh at this and they cut to go to commercial
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:52.760]  and kick me off the set and i start videotaping uh so i can put it on youtube because the bill
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:58.200]  berg group members coming in the chancellor of the x checker was coming in that's the you know
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.840]  head of their treasury bill berg group member he was meeting that night that night just an hour
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:09.000]  away and in watford at the bill berg meeting and it was admitted so i started interviewing him
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.320]  as he walks in i walk out in the hall they say get out of the building throw us out
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.760]  we walk across to us to a pizza place with wi-fi we ordered lunch
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.560]  and we start getting tweets and comments and then we see the video on youtube an hour later
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:34.280]  they went on tv and they said that man as soon as the cameras turned off said it's all fake i'm a fake
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:41.800]  none of this is real i did no such thing talk about something that the old days could have been like
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.560]  a duel in the street or something i mean they challenged my honor and said that i was a fraud
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.760]  but you know what i had him i'd already uploaded the bill berg video not even knowing that they
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.560]  made that claim because i wasn't watching tv once i was thrown out by security and thrown out of the
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:07.400]  building so again i then pointed out hey here's my video of right we go to break i had the phone
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.200]  and just just had a feeling to do it and turned it on and then here comes the builder bird guy
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.080]  and here they are telling me i'm a cook and saying get out of here i had it all on tape
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.960]  in fact i even taped some right there at the end while i was still on
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:27.560]  i started pulling it out and getting it going because i just had a feeling they almost physically
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.080]  attacked me at cnn when i got in the face i mean they had their crew guys and people just went
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:37.880]  get out of here get out of here get out get your ass out of here and and like they had weird like
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.480]  new york detectives all kind of bowed up waiting at the bottom i mean that got caught on video
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:48.040]  so i'm just explaining to you what goes on behind the scenes and that's what michael moore has done
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.560]  the slime bag michael moore trump is self-sabotaging his campaign because he's never really wanted
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.440]  the job in the first place he's running for president to get a better deal for the apprentice
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:04.120]  close quote donald trump never actually wanted to be president of the united states
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.200]  i know this for a fact i'm not going to say how i know it i'm not saying that trump and i
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.920]  share the same agent or lawyer or stylist or if we did that would have anything to do with anything
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:20.680]  so he's telling you that's what happened and i'm certainly not saying i overheard anything at those
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.720]  agencies or in the hallways in nbc or anywhere else but there are certain people reading this
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.200]  right now they know who they are and they know every word in the following paragraph actually
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:37.160]  happened and then he goes on to describe how he made it all up and said give me a bigger deal
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:40.840]  i can run for president show you how popular i am trump was not happy with his deal and
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:46.840]  then host and star it was hit nbc show the apprentice simply put he wanted more money
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.560]  he had floated the idea before the possibility of running for president in the hopes of the
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:57.320]  attention from that would make his negotiations position stronger now who knows if that's even
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:03.080]  partially true that if back in 2008 2012 sometimes he would flirt with it to get attention sure
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.240]  but see now he acts like none of it's real
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:12.600]  and then he just goes on to say it's all made up and then on seeing in this morning and we're
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.040]  going to go to break and come back with a steve quell still steve quell.com but i wanted to get
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:21.320]  this out they were saying the same thing trump is getting ready to lose he's getting ready to step
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.160]  down he's getting ready to stop they gave no proof because he wants his own tv network
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:33.000]  they know for how many years five six seven that trumps openly talked about having a patriot
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.320]  nationalist network and quite frankly if he loses he's so angry about the fraud in this country he
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:43.560]  wants to keep fighting he wants to do that in the position his family to run for president
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.600]  just like i'm on air and have a platform to fight the new world order that's why i do this
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:56.520]  money isn't a bad thing and i needed to operate and fund our operation but i've been offered more
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:05.000]  money than i personally make a year a decade ago i was offered glenn beck's job before he even got
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.360]  syndicated they said we've got a couple people we're developing have you heard of glenn beck
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:13.800]  and i said no not really well we got a bunch of affiliates around the country that are ready to
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.160]  pick him up we're gonna put him on clear channel we're making a big deal and uh
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.040]  you know we want you to be involved in this but you're gonna have to do what we tell you
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:30.600]  didn't do it so see they're always spending it that i quote do this for money oh but it's
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:35.720]  okay that abc and nbc and cnn and you know all these people it's okay if some of the fox house
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.120]  make five ten million dollars a year that's okay it's okay if rush limbaugh makes 30 million
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:46.280]  dollars a year it's okay but see if you're a patriot and you sell books or water filters or
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:54.040]  films to fund yourself or coffee mugs or gun sights or sunglasses or water filters oh it's
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:01.240]  so dirty when you question known liars you're a conspiracy theorist that's how they operate but
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.400]  folks have seen through it and they go get high quality products high quality

[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:44.120]  always have but just because we're trailblazers because we had to be we had to build something new
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:48.360]  and do something different to figure out how to get the light of truth into this world

[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:26.280]  so was the john birch society an individual i would have to say marks the second wave
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:34.200]  would be someone like steve quail or someone like ron poll and then i mark and drudge marks
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:40.280]  the start of the third wave though drudge was a lot more successful than i was early on drudge
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:49.240]  and i started right around the same time 1995 or so steve quills me with us 20 minutes or 30
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.240]  minutes to the next hour then our reporters join us this is a brief segment that i was just talking
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.800]  to steve quail during the break he's never been so on fire everything he was saying was connecting
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.160]  all the dots steve please repeat to the audience what you just said to me over the phone during the
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:11.560]  break well alex i believe that the whole hillary for presidency uh facade that all of the news of
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:17.000]  vomit brokers meaning the big networks are putting forth it's just to keep us occupied it appears
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.920]  based on the events taking place today that and all the executive orders being signed in the last
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:29.480]  couple weeks and all the united nations talk it will be a miracle literally if we have an election
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:34.120]  and you know i think when you and i've talked about this let me read you one of sololinsky's
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:41.880]  rules for radicals uh radicals okay a new word radicals ridicule is man's most potent weapon
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.400]  there is no defense it's irrational it's infuriating it also works as a key pressure point
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:53.160]  to force the enemy into concessions now what's critical in that statement is to understand
[01:25:53.720 --> 01:26:00.360]  the denigration of donald trump the absolute lies about donald trump the absolute ridicule
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.360]  that is uh going on ad nauseam first of all i find it interesting that people who have never
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:13.000]  done anything never accomplished anything are basically paid hacks are being funded by you
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.600]  know the billionaires in the background to take on donald trump the reason that i said on george
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:24.360]  norrie coast to coast before donald announced his or mr trump announced his run for presidency
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.280]  as george asked me on the air i said are you uh endorsing and and at that point he wasn't uh
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:36.280]  donald trump they said absolutely i said when i see who everybody hates or the people that hate
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.560]  him i will stand with the guy always that speaks the truth well that's king you were for trump
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.760]  before even announced and i had people over the years reached out to me about donald trump and
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:49.160]  how he was a patriot and i just wasn't paying attention but he has been uh you know really
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:57.080]  quietly getting ready for this for 30 years now during the break you when we first got on the line
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.680]  you were telling me what you wanted to cover today it was amazing how you were connecting the dots
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:06.920]  with with with greece and with russia and ukraine and the strong cities initiatives and suddenly all
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:13.160]  over the news we're under un command and george soros's emails are public uh how they admit they
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:18.520]  plan to replace us with jihadis i mean this is incredible this is really happening well and
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.080]  you've warned about it i've warned about the un takeover has already been taken over and i think
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:27.720]  it's important that people understand uh from the greek newspapers i put one up on my site you
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:33.080]  know it had to go through google translate it's on my alert section alec but the ukrainians and russians
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:39.160]  have started firing at each other russia's moved 40 000 troops so it's not posturing the other thing
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:44.840]  that's really troubling is when the whole situation in turkey went down i was one of the and i was one
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.880]  of the first guys to say look we've got nuclear weapons there and now rt and the ap admit the
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.560]  bases surrounded with a whole bunch of nukes what's what's happening there why don't we just fly the
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:28:00.680]  nukes out yep well listen the deal is and i'm serious about this every single uh you know jellyfish
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:06.280]  congressman and senator they should be absolutely livid because there's not just you know they say
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:13.880]  90 uh b61 um nuclear warheads or that there are h bombs at insurlic that is nato's forward staging
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:21.640]  base and russia has effectively i'm telling you this they have delved nato by uh going up with
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:29.160]  erdogan and now the turkish press is calling for you're ready for this the seizure of all those
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:36.200]  nuclear weapons i said if erdogan gets the nuclear weapons and given to him by his friend in the
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:44.040]  white house we're in big trouble and alex normally something of that consequence would be so great
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:48.120]  that you'd think everybody would be heralding it instead of just saying oh it doesn't matter
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:54.360]  it really matters ladies and gentlemen go look at doing internet search on hydrogen bombs you know
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.760]  they say oh they're just and by the way this isn't hype you you you were talking a month ago about how
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:04.520]  jihadis are backing erdogan you've got all all these coups and counter coups now they're suddenly
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.760]  buddies with the russians when erdogan was just shooting down russian aircraft just a year ago
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:15.080]  major power shifts uh and by the way the russians have sent a bunch of troops in fighting is escalating
[01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:22.440]  in eastern ukraine and it's not even on our news not at all and here's the thing the i think i think
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:28.440]  vladimir put again i'm not a russophile i'm just saying truth is truth okay but because we've become
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:35.240]  a nation that bays and lies wallows and lies like a big dozen mud that absolutely can no longer
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:41.800]  think that chooses to basically be entertained instead of educated we are right for the taking
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:46.360]  and what i think is the the point that everyone ought to realize this uh stay there stay we got
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.680]  to come right back but but again a few newspapers are reporting it but it's not a big news story
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:57.640]  it should be we're on the march stay with us the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.200]  these are great products number one but number two and this is importantly
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:46.040]  you're funding this operation and finally america the film that was a five million

[01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:03.880]  second copy of it you get two of my films fall the republic and matrix of evil free i i guess we
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:08.360]  sold out of america's way by design so we had to stop offering that one for free and go to matrix of
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.840]  evil that's excellent as well but fall the republic is really i mean that that was made six years ago
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.400]  and everything in it unfortunately has basically come through it just blows people away when they
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:21.720]  see it it's it's what they call evergreen it's more important today than it was back then
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:27.000]  then so the toll free number to call and take advantage of that america in the movie get one

[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:50.680]  get a second copy two films free that's four films for the price of two and a great way to

[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:49.960]  dot com to break down because just while he was talking about it i was really ashamed of myself
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.000]  i'm gonna be honest in the last few days the russians caught ukrainian troops attacking
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.920]  people shooting people and blowing stuff up and attempting to blow stuff up inside russia proper
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.560]  in a provocation so russia's moved a bunch of troops up to the border they're rolling more
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:11.240]  troops now into uh the eastern area of ukraine that has seceded to russia and it's historically
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:18.200]  been part of russia kramia that russia has fought five major wars of and dozens of small wars i mean
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:24.440]  it's just so many you can historians can't decide how many wars fighting intensifies in east ukraine
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:30.520]  combat zone i mean this is being reported by foreign major newspapers ukraine today you name it
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:35.880]  this is not really in our news in our news the washington post says while the world is distracted
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:40.440]  putin escalates his war in ukraine well we're gonna get the actual clip of his his press conference
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:45.480]  a few days ago and what he said but but notice i say i'm watching this and i'm so busy following
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:50.280]  2016 and trump and the stock market and the announcement that the un is going to run our
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:58.680]  local police and and just congress pursuing perjury charges against hillary and uh fake polls and
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:05.000]  obama care and all these leaks and all the stuff that's happening that i get steve quail on
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.880]  and he goes you know a war is escalating russian fsb foils terrorist attacks plotted by ukrainian
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:17.480]  intel agents in kramia that's rt and again there's been explosions stuff blowing up power lines
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:24.760]  getting severed this is a real asymmetrical situation going on and you've got nato massing
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:29.880]  troops right there on the border in poland and other areas with russia this is a really serious
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:34.120]  time to be alive so if you're a radio listener you hear me mentioning these headlines i'm reading
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:40.680]  headlines in real time we're throwing on screen at info wars dot com forward slash show this is what
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:45.080]  radio is like on television you see basically everybody going to this format now i'm proud
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:51.560]  of the fact info wars trailblazed it and is the founder of it in this format uh often
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:58.600]  imitated and many times duplicated we actually uh want to be made obsolete by defeating the new
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:04.200]  world order there'll be new problems we're not offering some utopia but i don't want things to
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.920]  be this intense i don't need things to be this riveting i don't need to have my heart racing
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:13.560]  all the time i don't need to be you know i mean there'll always be corruption and stuff to deal
[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.840]  with we'll always be able to have a show but but i don't want it to be so incredibly cutting edge
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:22.760]  and so incredibly dangerous and i'm way out here on the tip of the spear i want to dial back the
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:27.560]  evil i want to end it if we could but you know humans are inherently fallen so this we're always
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:33.400]  going to have problems the issue is this is real folks this is happening and all over the world
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.080]  there's major destabilization so get into what's happening you've got the floor steve quill
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:42.280]  please don't pause or thank me just take over or i'll interrupt get into why all hell's breaking
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:47.320]  loose historically at this one time and what the globalists are really planning steve quill well
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:52.360]  this is a going for it alex there's no holding back now we've warned we've warned we've warned and
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:58.440]  now it's all in play the internet goes down into foreign hands october first i guarantee you there's
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:04.440]  a secret deal that the un will consider anything that you are anybody who's talking i already
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:09.240]  admit that i'm sorry they already admit that they're gonna apply the german and and and french rules
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.640]  of censorship and soros got caught i said i wouldn't interrupt i gotta back up what you're saying
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:18.200]  because you're saying it intuitively steve it's admitted in his new emails george soros is running
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:23.160]  a whole group to target people that criticize radical islam and shut us down and now the mayor
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.880]  of london is saying he's going to arrest you if you criticize islam i'm sorry go ahead no that's
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.120]  it alex and here's the thing again i want to say this because i wasn't clear enough last time was
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:39.080]  on your show last week the plan is this ladies and gentlemen to generate a third world war
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:46.440]  under the muslim auspices and in doing so that provides the fulfillment of their prophecy
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  that it will be on the back of a global nuclear conflagration that the iman maddie comes on the
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.760]  scene now alex i said that 20 years ago and most people thought you know well then they
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:02.360]  thought everything that we were talking about was crazy but here's the thing we're now seeing
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:06.040]  russia is saying and i just got an email from somebody saying why are you guys kissing the
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:14.600]  russians you know what i'm not i'm saying this listen it is counterintuitive to want the depth
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:20.040]  of however many billion and see this is what this is where we are the most naive people in
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:26.360]  united states were dumbed down uh... chemically emasculated from the zeno estrogen in the water
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:31.880]  the bottom line is that you know i told people i guess america got stupid when it's sperm could
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:37.560]  no longer count and it's because of and you think that's a statement of uh... of just
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:43.000]  you know being off the wall listen we are seeing right now the implementation of a
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:51.160]  pre-world war three scenario when russia and china announced that china actually announced
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:56.280]  shooting one of their new uh... satellite into space that is basically just going to be you
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:01.880]  can't break their encryption well what most people don't know is russia put some of their
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:08.360]  data on it too now they used to have a system by which a certain command centers of theirs go dead
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:13.240]  uh... their uh... their military installations and all their hidden weapons are fired almost
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.600]  uh... concurrently and simultaneously doomsday plan
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:20.680]  you got it and they have another name for forgive me alex these talk about all the time but here's
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:26.440]  the deal look at this alec we are uh... what is it today the seventeen the seventeenth of august
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:32.040]  well he's really calling the samson option but i'm sorry my ruptured no that's a samson option
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:36.760]  you know that's israel uh... the russians have a i think it's called the dead hand option or
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:42.200]  something like that samson option is israel's very similar to it i'm sure we got it the same thing
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:47.560]  that means bringing the whole world down yep and here's the thing you know let me share this
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:53.000]  i'm going to go to the 13th rules of radicals because i've got to tell you look at what they're
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.320]  doing this is why they're doing the dot uh... donald trump and it's why they're so arrogant it's why
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:01.560]  they're moving on every front this is the reason they're moving listen pick the target freeze it
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:07.000]  personalize it and polarizer cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy go
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.640]  after people and listen to this non-institutions people hurt faster than institutions so we're
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:20.360]  seeing this played out and i believe and i'm gonna say this again you know god's got his trump card
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:26.040]  to play i can tell you when i make that statement you know i'll get so many emails and might as well
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.080]  you know put them out as a hate crime i forgot that you biblically mentioned trump way before he
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:38.440]  announced how did you do that well here's the thing i look at who a man's enemies are and i think
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:46.600]  that uh we're watching right now the total if you will into the whole world historically when the
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:53.560]  odds are absolutely against speaking the truth that god always has what i call the ram in the
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:59.480]  bush okay and it's based on abraham and isaac and opera by isaac but god provided the ram for the
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:08.040]  sacrifice it's the do sex yeah i'm sorry do sex yep so the thing is is that where we're at right now
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.080]  is that it's all in play it's seriously alex i don't know how you think at night when you
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:18.200]  you know try to shut down i don't shut down very well no no no i used to i slept right now i just
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:25.000]  dream about work at all i mean the entire night i'm just working well you know the bottom line is
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.800]  and that's a uh an overused uh statement of mine makes people crazy when you cut through all the
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:34.920]  crap here's where we're at we are at world war three time it's up to the living god
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:40.040]  and to decide when uh you know his hand of protection is taken off and the average american
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:47.720]  is totally asleep yep yep and and this is uh this is one of the most important things i've seen
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:53.400]  and i am telling people look get it do you get it the internet you've known is going away that's
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:58.120]  what matt grudge said when he was in your studio and remember supreme court judge okay so let's take
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:02.760]  it up to now in october first the united nations has handed the entire control of the internet
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:09.720]  the rules the regulations the dnc takedown orders all of it it is now happening and alex over the
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:16.520]  years have been on talk radio and some generals in your area uh you know multi stars and more stars
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:22.520]  and people are aware of basically have absolutely validated the un troops when people say where are
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.800]  they i don't see them you know these are just un vehicles being made going under un control
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:35.720]  un regulation under unesco uh loretta lynch who has been a un lawyer for over 10 years she worked
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:41.880]  for the united nations world criminal court and she's announcing our police are going under
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:49.080]  un regulations they are giving them un orders absolutely and now here's what people have got
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:56.520]  to understand the the amount of weapons in this country that were pre-staged you and i did shows
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.680]  i can i can remember the topics they don't remember the years almost 15 years ago even
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:07.480]  when bo gretz gretz was talking about all the ships coming in to uh the los angeles their long
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:13.160]  beach uh shipyards that's my next question a lot of that was old stuff now it's it's newer abrams
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:18.360]  it's newer fighting vehicles armored vehicles a brand new fighting vehicles by the thousands
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.480]  and thousands being pre-deployed i've been i've confirmed uh in rural areas everywhere to take
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.760]  on patriots they admit they're training to take on gun owners and veterans uh this is insane well
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:35.000]  it's not only insane but the amount of minimum material that has been moved into underground
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.320]  remember this ladies and gentlemen under george bush senior and you member alex that he closed
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:43.560]  down all these military bases well they didn't go out of business they didn't board them and you
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:47.800]  and i said that wasn't the case because of our sources and then they even admitted in that
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.080]  legislation the emergency centers establishment act that they retrofitted them as emergency
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.160]  centers for at least three million americans that was just the first announcement and indeed
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:03.160]  they were set up and that actually happened right and so the thing is is that even in montana
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:09.240]  the amount of weapons and by the way there there are pictures of uh multiple rocket launchers and
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:14.760]  it's not all it's not all us material i've talked to c 130 pilots i've talked to us well let's break
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.080]  down then how they would roll out different scenarios because obviously it's all deception
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:23.320]  start a war with the russians then claim that the patriots are working with the russians
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:29.240]  then start going after us and it's a un globalist leftist attack here but then a lot of americans
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.760]  get in line with it because they believe they're fighting russian agents that's kind of the angle
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.400]  i see them developing well yeah and and that it's not only that but the chinese are you know
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:41.640]  actively i don't think the chinese will be the muscle of the new world order that's been known
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.840]  yeah and but here's the thing okay the amount of advanced weapon systems when i had nothing to
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:51.640]  with my better with my life in the early days of talk radio i just you know read jane's defense
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.840]  weekly and talk to a lot of different people i'll tell you one thing i've learned and and this is
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:03.400]  true you can russia will tell you what they're going to do russia will say don't do it now i
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.640]  get russia said keep deploying missiles that we know i have to extend them we're gonna have to strike
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:13.720]  them yep and now we're even having to recognize the fact that excuse me ladies and gentlemen
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:19.320]  half of the u.s military who by the way declared war on god cannot and i'm talking the living god
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:22.680]  you can be a satanist you can be a wick and priest you can be whatever you want to be
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:27.000]  you can be this that or the other thing but if you're christian you're out but half of their
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:34.680]  flying assets aren't even uh bit to fly and now we've got the lowest combat readiness and by the
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:39.320]  way so we've been sabotaged we've been sabotaged we've been sabotaged we are destroyed from enemies
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:46.040]  within traders from within and and this is the thing that that gets me it's not the fact that
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:51.160]  you've got the biggest liar in history caught with their biggest hand in the biggest pocket book
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:55.240]  of literally hundreds of billions of dollars the only way you save them is start no war and
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:00.360]  then people get in line yep and and that that that there's still basically people are saying we
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:07.320]  don't care about that i think this alex i think that what you're seeing right now in uh not only
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:15.160]  on in the court of uh earthly uh perception but in the court of heaven all of the uh indictments
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:20.200]  against the united states to see everybody used to think we're the united states we're the greatest
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:26.440]  i love the country that we once had i cannot even i identify the country we now exist in
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:31.640]  in which which you have done over the years is say this is what's in play this is what's in play
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:36.120]  this is what's in play what i've done over the years saying here is how it's going to play out
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:42.440]  you too but what i'm saying is this is that we're now at the nexus point we are at that point we
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:48.280]  are at the uh center of the hub of a bicycle tire without a return event horizon let me say this to
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:53.160]  you then i've talked about having storeable food and stuff because i thought it was a possibility
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:57.080]  of economic collapse or other things you see all the disasters and things i mean it's just a smart
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:02.360]  thing to do old timers always did it you know in modern times look how domesticated we are we don't
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:08.520]  i've gone from thinking okay there's a chance that'll happen to a probability now to a certainty
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:13.000]  talking to all the top economists across the board the question is just win with the elites
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.440]  building armored fortresses all in all these remote areas of the world already leaving uh i told
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.520]  people that six years ago and it really accelerated now it's admitted you know the new york times and
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:27.000]  the washington post the london guardian we're not excited steve quill and i about being right
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.800]  about all this yeah i'm sitting here personally having to get ready getting storeable food medical
[01:51:31.800 --> 01:51:36.440]  supplies and and things are at the office and security plans and solar generators and gas
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:43.400]  generators because we're just hoping somehow people in our government or stop the globalist
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.960]  who are admitted foreign agents our own government folks is hacking by the way it's not the russians
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:52.680]  we've now confirmed that they did some earlier stuff uh patriots are the ones leaking the sorrow
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:56.680]  stuff the hillary stuff to to wiki leaks and everybody else they're killing people that are
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:02.120]  leaking it uh but we've never had so many leaks now they're actually very good quality but super
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:08.600]  dangerous to even try to vet uh i mean that's above my pay grade quite frankly even because
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:14.120]  finally the government realizes oh my god we've been set for self-destruct it's sabotage people
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:18.280]  finally get that they really are trying to ban the word mother and father and are doing it they
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:21.640]  really are saying christians are the enemy they really are saying veterans are going to be rounded
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:27.080]  up and reeducated and they're in hillary's even saying reeducation camps now it's even on the news
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:32.200]  they're getting ready for something huge they they've got evil looks in their eyes they're running
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:37.000]  around like chickens with their heads cut off in preparation suddenly red brigades are popping up
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.480]  everywhere i go i see communists and communist flags just running around giggling and laughing
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:47.720]  uh the foreign powers are trying to set up cop killer squads you can clearly see we're being
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:52.040]  brought into something really nasty and this isn't a beta test that's what you're getting at here
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:57.000]  and is there any way to try to avert this and what do you think the timeline is if we're unable
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.880]  to stop it because i mean they admit shooting war is intensified between russia and proxy army
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:08.120]  ukraine with nato we are now fighting the russians it's been going on but it's it's it's escalating
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:13.320]  now we've got video that nobody's seeing the west of putin about to come up translated i'm not
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.640]  trying to scare people here i'm telling you folks well can i tell you something if if everything
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:24.600]  we've told them gently increasing the feverish pitch of giving him documents he gave him this
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:30.600]  remember this you're dealing i'm dealing we're dealing with that we're dealing with the remnant
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:37.720]  you cannot wake up a big enough body of people to vote a difference what it's going to take and
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:41.800]  you asked me this too last time we were on the show together is an awareness now let me just say
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:48.680]  one thing about america and i told gary said gary haven i said you've covered 35 issues that it's
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:54.760]  imperative that people get that dvd and send it to their loved ones or their doubter ones
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:54:01.480]  because the time that he ever you know released it early through you exclusively alex was timed
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:07.160]  with the headlines there were probably i don't know 1012 headlines that i picked up on my website
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:12.920]  do you end this you end that obama this obama that lynch this lynch that so the bottom line is
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:19.720]  is that ladies and gentlemen if you want to see something that is so timed so specific to the
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:25.080]  time you're living in now you better get that film and i'm saying seriously it is that good it is
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:30.520]  that important is that timely and i would say that alex your special is good it's not enough just to
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:36.200]  buy one and see one buy one give it away get it to the people that absolutely are kind of fans
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:42.920]  sitters and i'll say this alex the the spiritual realm of this is increasing every day on drudge
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:48.840]  more demon stuff more more horrific satan stuff they're back to eating people's faces off i remember
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:53.480]  saying that 20 years ago and you know even you thought i was a little off you know off my rocker
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:55:00.760]  in those days but the point is is that when you see something in the future most people cannot
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:06.040]  grasp it because they don't yet see it playing out because they go into that but now but now
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.480]  it's gone from probability to almost certainty that we're seeing major wars and our elites
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:17.080]  are so crazy samantha powers laughing about war with russia this is putin a month and a half ago
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:21.080]  we played this clip many times we've got a new clip but we've got to translate it into english so
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:25.960]  that'll be in a special report on the nightly news tonight where he's doing even more dire warnings
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:31.160]  just yesterday about the proxy army starting war with russia and and george soros admits
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:36.840]  he started the overthrow of ukraine and the war with russia but then they tell us in our media
[01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:42.280]  russia started it russia didn't start it so let's play this clip of putin warning the world
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:47.400]  how do you not understand that the world is being pulled in an irreversible direction
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:54.280]  that is the problem but they pretend like nothing's going on i don't even know how to
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:56:02.440]  get through to you people anymore and what do they say uh oh it's this is part of a defense
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:12.040]  potential not the offensive weaponry that these systems are meant to prevent aggression this is
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:19.560]  not the truth this is incorrect a missile defense system is part of a whole system of offensive
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:26.680]  military potential and all this works as part of a whole that includes offensive missile launchers
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.240]  and then he goes on one complex block do you realize the peril do you realize the danger
[01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:35.160]  i'm not going to play at all because we've already played it like 10 times but you'd think that'd be
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:41.480]  on us news when the russian president is talking about this and there's a shooting war going on
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:47.720]  instead they're trying to teach five-year-olds how to be transsexual steve quill well again i would call
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:54.200]  this the judas news okay what basically is and alex imagine i if you've got somebody draw a cartoon
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:57:02.600]  imagine a pedestal tv studio mbc cbs a bc with a bombed out destroyed new york and you've got them
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:08.840]  the television cameras on the set but everything is cut off everything is destroyed and uh the people
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:13.000]  are you know the people that are the broadcasters are all disheveled you know whether the male or
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.840]  female asking each other what do you think what do you think this really means that's that's
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:25.480]  exactly i think people are are beyond uh mind control zombies that's like fox news this weekend
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:31.240]  goes coming up is the media bias against donald trump and they came back and concluded it wasn't
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:37.240]  steve that's supposedly conservative tv now right and i'll give you a good example it's like it's
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:42.920]  like a group of vampire vampires at a vampire convention okay and one of them says you know uh
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:47.800]  there we we'd have a lot more fans if we didn't kill them all and drink their blood they all vote
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:52.680]  basically you know that sounds like a weed public opinion on our side the minute it turns
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:56.760]  to dark man they're out you know chomping on the necks and sucking the blood of everybody
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:03.480]  they are blood sucking parasites who have sucked the life out of the american people the bankers
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:07.800]  are blood sucking parasites that have taken the hope for the future and they don't know when to
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:10.840]  quit they don't know when to quit they don't know when to quit they don't want to tell you something
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:16.200]  they can't because they're like jackals and hyenas and they're like a bunch of uh african uh
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:22.200]  bees you know on a dead carcass see that's what we're seeing alex and that's what breaks my heart
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:28.680]  look i wish i would have been wrong i'm sorry that this is something that these hyenas are gonna sit
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:34.920]  there and eat wilder bees till the nukes go off they just don't care and and then they're feasting
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:41.080]  on the lazy flesh of and i'm serious and people don't know you're right back in 72nd steve quills

[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:17.080]  brain force right there i popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing everything

[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:28.040]  why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best

[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:37.640]  while but i probably could not have done it without brain force i went home about 645 this morning
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:42.200]  i took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in you will find

[01:59:50.360 --> 02:00:09.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:26.360]  by the way you know we have to crack a big nut every day here with over 50 crew members
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:32.520]  reporters writers researchers switchers producers researchers you know the vascular
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:38.360]  journalists then you got one maintenance guy and some customer service and the shipping department
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:44.200]  i mean that we're a small crew but it's expensive i mean if i live in new york city or something we
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:49.320]  get at 15 people not 50 something we have a lot of contractors too more than 70 people total
[02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:54.040]  to make this uh the ship sail every day i'm not going to sit her in plug right now but they just
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:59.960]  came in we're offering when you get to america is the new film exclusively available five million
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:06.040]  dollar budget exposing a new world order and a fiction account near future you get two of my
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:14.840]  films free well the problem is we sold out of the films we were already offering free
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:20.120]  so we had to change it again and now we're about to sell out a matrix of evil
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:26.520]  and fall the republic so the new special is buy two copies and get two alex jones films free
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:35.640]  police state four and the police state trilogy that's that's four films all of my police state
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:44.040]  films and the two americans for the price of the two americans so and that'll probably sell out real
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.800]  quick too but i mean i guess we're getting low on my dvds because we're selling so many of these so
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:51.960]  that's a god's end help fund the operation so thank you for your support with the long segments
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:56.040]  coming up steve quill but we got three minutes to break please continue sir i've never seen you
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:02:01.720]  on fire like this i guess it's just the times we're living in well alex we're about ready to see
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:08.040]  events that with no pun intended are going to go atmospheric and outside of praying christians
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:12.600]  and i mean this i believe with all my heart that what we're going to see is god's super
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:18.520]  naturally delivering people in places of this country but years ago i said on the radio ask
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:24.840]  two specific areas of sin so what their judgment be we're seeing episodic quakes happening on the
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:31.480]  west coast they've always heard all california is going to fall off in the ocean we've seen so much
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:37.240]  satanism we've seen so much demon possession and ladies and gentlemen whether you believe it's
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:42.520]  real or not this stuff is real and alex that's the key you can't just blame somebody wants to blame
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:47.320]  this faction or that faction they want to blame the jews they want to blame the jesuit they want
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:52.680]  to blame the catholics they want to blame me they want to blame you but they don't get the fact that
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:58.680]  look it's not a question of blame it's identifying the root of evil and these people and you said
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:04.120]  it and you've brought your whole i guess you'd say your whole view to this point that there is a
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:11.240]  supernatural entity a supernatural wisdom directing the total destruction of all morality
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:18.200]  all values borders language culture and the to get the country and the family and god
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.840]  it particularly hates christians and if you expand on this and the globals will go out of their way
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.920]  to kill a christian for no reason obama won't let christians get out of syria and if you looked at
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:31.720]  it from a science fiction perspective it's like an interdimensional invasion is basically what does
[02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:36.760]  this oh really and and can i tell you something years ago i said on talk radio and this is important
[02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:43.880]  real quick that the unseen would become visible and that's that the things of men's nightmare would
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:49.560]  come into the physical realm so when you see all the all the if you will the goreish ghastly
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:55.080]  everything hollywood has uh pretty much produced as the leading us so they admit now with all the
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:04:00.200]  hollywood shows and super bowl things with all the satanism they believe they're bringing this power
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:06.040]  in they admit they're doing rituals absolutely it's a ritual magic it's serious and by the way
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:12.440]  the satanists believe in the power of uh the the entity they serve i wish the christians would
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:17.080]  absolutely have a revelation from the living god that greater is he the lord jesus christ
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:21.000]  that's a good point i agree why are the satanists when we come back suddenly coming out of the
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.120]  woodwork why are they being so obvious now it's like again it's like all hell's breaking loose
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:32.040]  and it's only intensifying well it's simply because the salt is lost its favor and the light of the
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:36.600]  world the gospel jesus christ has gone out now people hate to hear me say that they like to hear
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:40.920]  what i know but they don't want to hear this talk about jesus well jesus is the one that told us all
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:43.880]  this is going to happen the book of revelations i'll tell you this right now i've been fighting
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:47.720]  the globals for 25 years and i tell you there's one thing they hate and that's the word the name
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:52.840]  jesus christ and okay that's that's that's the power and then it's real they hate it for whatever
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:56.520]  reason you add these to people don't you know get it you're off your own law land that your
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:02.920]  elite masters are a bunch of devil worshiping lucifer loving trash we'll be back donald trump
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:10.200]  says hillary clinton lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on isis and other foreign threats
[02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:16.040]  to the us questions about hillary's health are intensifying after the release of a viral
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:22.440]  info wars video asking why she's been behaving so strange during the campaign what on earth could
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:29.560]  be the reason behind hillary clinton's bizarre behavior in recent weeks weird seizures psychotic
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:37.480]  facial tics over exaggerated reactions coughing fits strange lesions on her tongue is hillary on
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:43.880]  the verge of a mental breakdown due to stress or are her strange outbursts linked to a medical
[02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:48.360]  condition the speeches are so short though they don't last long you know they're like
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:53.320]  ten minutes let's get out of here go back home and go to sleep meanwhile leftist media outlets

[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:08.200]  in Milwaukee they're about to come back to a trump rally last night covered some of the
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:13.000]  attempts by the communists that's who the police said it was the communists came from Chicago and
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:19.480]  stirred up a black cop shooting a black guy supposedly waving a gun saying the black cop
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:24.440]  though has a history of corruption problems okay whatever just don't burn down your own neighborhood
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:30.200]  and shoot random people because of it i mean you know you talk about mind control folks i don't get
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:35.160]  off on looking at people doing horrible things and say look at those bad people i feel better about
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:40.440]  myself but i don't like being criticized when i see people dragging whites out of cars beating
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:45.160]  them up calling them racist names killing people you know in other cases or shooting up a black
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:50.200]  lady's car because she you know bumped into black lives matter people it is this incredible
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:57.480]  entitlement of a bunch of dumb teenagers who just want to swagger around to be thugs and all you're
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:03.640]  going to do is make the police hate you that much more and cause a bigger problem we do not want to
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:07.800]  have a war with the police we want to get our communities under local control they're going to
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:15.240]  use this crisis to bring in the strong city initiative un run police that's mainstream news
[02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:22.840]  quite frankly i'm pinching myself at how accurate i've been and i used to think i was going on a
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:28.120]  limb a lot of stuff and usually it turns out it's worse than i said people accuse me of exaggeration
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:41.400]  no no steve quail now who i never thought steve quail was crazy i i thought you know this guy's
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:46.280]  a little eccentric and and you know this is just you know really almost like science fiction
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:52.600]  geoengineering aluminum oxide he was the first guy i heard 20 plus years ago talking about their
[02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:57.000]  spring aluminum it's all admitted now the department of energy admits five billion a year to spray
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:02.360]  aluminum on us to quote test guarding us from the sun and then the aluminum levels rising
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:06.680]  and the plants are dying everywhere i drive out in the hill country it's not oak will i've talked to
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:13.720]  the uh horticulturalist i've talked to the arborist they say no alex there's the aluminum in the soil
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:18.760]  i mean it's like space aliens are running the planet trying to kill everything it the planet's
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.160]  being killed in front of us is slow motion they're genetically splicing everything they're playing god
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:29.080]  just like the bible said and i i never lost faith in god but you know i got sick of being
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:33.640]  drugged at church twice a week when i was a kid and my dad pinched me to stay up you know in three
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:39.960]  hour church services uh and dough we've got to go to the you know minister to the you know to the
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:45.640]  old folks home this weekend oh great another christmas you know giving homeless people soup
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:49.880]  i mean i'll admit it i wasn't some angel i wanted to you know go play baseball or
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:54.280]  you know getting barren uncle's fist fights or go pick up you know the cheerleader down the street
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:58.680]  but i thank god my parents did that because i got a real christian education and by that i mean
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:03.080]  really caring about people um but i'll tell you you know sit there on christmas eve freezing your
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:08.840]  ass off in downtown dallas feeding homeless people it's not fun when you're 14 years old um but i tell
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:16.120]  you comparing somebody like my parents that are so good and would never screw anybody over i thought
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:21.400]  of myself was like nasty and evil compared to them i look at the enemy and who they are they
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:27.000]  live to hurt innocent people they live to lie they live to be dishonorable and that's why they've
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  got the jump on us his good people just cannot imagine you know steve said he was a racy guy in
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:41.240]  film school and doing wild stuff it almost seems like god does kind of pick the bad boys to take
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:44.920]  on the new world order though steve and i and i and that's what i want to say to the other bad boys
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:49.320]  and girls out there a lot of times the devil will try to convict your heart as the accuser and say
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:53.480]  you've done bad stuff in your life and you've been a mean person you've had hateful thoughts and you
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:57.240]  you know didn't need to stomp on that guy's head after he was already down or you didn't need to
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.400]  you know do this or that but that's the devil trying to make us feel guilty so we don't get
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:06.920]  involved look god forgives us all as soon as we really do repent and then once we take action
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:11.880]  against evil but i find so many of the real people that could take down the new world order
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:16.840]  say i just can't do it i'm too evil i've done bad things god doesn't care as long as you repent
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:23.880]  of it and take action right steve here's the thing the there is no all sin is forgivable
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:28.840]  through the blood of jesus christ and repentance you know and look i was no i i was i was out of
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:34.200]  control okay i've shared my testimony on major show i was to i was i was i was i was out and
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:40.200]  look i'm not proud of it but the bible says he who's forgiven much loves much okay and i'm telling
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:46.280]  us we're saying the same thing right now we're in agreement there is nobody listening to us
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:51.720]  beyond the grace and the forgiveness of the living god when god said god's love i got news for you
[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:57.480]  you can't say that in the uh islamic faith that god is love you know you can't say that
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:02.600]  jesus said no greater love has this and a man lays down his life for a friend and then jesus
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:08.840]  you know let me just deal with the name of jesus where did it go wrong you can see you can name
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:16.040]  any name you can have any rockstar you can have any corn you can have any uh words that are so
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:22.360]  disgusting put out there and all the different acts between all the different 31 flavors of
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:29.480]  non-human uh designation but at the end of the day alex the thing is that there's only one name
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:35.080]  that's hated beyond all names and that's the name of jesus christ jesus said they hated me
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:40.680]  without a cause they're going to hate you but you ask why it's this way because the churches you
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:46.040]  know i i finally figured out i think just the other day that the word puke and puke have the
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:51.960]  same sound you know and i call the pastors that are sellouts to satan pukes in the pulpit you know
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:57.720]  look god never wanted his people to be entertained he wanted them to be changed and and that's what
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.640]  we're talking about so i hear you know the most important thing that i can tell everybody for
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:06.280]  preparation and as one of the founders of the prep movement you know decades ago
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:11.960]  30 some years ago now the bottom line is get right with jesus because it's not enough to just
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:17.720]  you know look they're coming to kill a lot of us if they had the way they kill all of us but if
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.080]  jesus said don't fear if they were he who can kill your body but rather fear him who can send you
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:27.640]  to hell and see there's no fear of god okay but i want to go to one more rule of radical because
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.840]  this is it you brought up the police okay if you push a negative hard enough it will push through
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:38.200]  and become a positive violence from the other side can win the public your side because the public
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:43.800]  sympathizes with the underdog i have been pleading i have friends in law enforcement so do you i have
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:48.840]  friends in the military so do you have friends and boy do i have enemies on the opposite side but
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:55.080]  the point being is i i warned that civil war was coming i warned that the whole point would be to
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.720]  turn the police against the people the people against the police and i said to both of them i said
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:05.560]  don't don't buy that i said to the black gangs i said to the latino gangs this is years ago 15 years
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:11.160]  ago don't buy it you're going to be used and when they're now i remember you you said it all first
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:16.280]  eve you've been the most accurate it's crazy well i i would say this is because that was my calling
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:21.080]  in god you know and all i'm saying look i tell people look don't believe me but you can do the
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:26.360]  same thing alex you can present videos you can present in essence every video you've done everything
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:31.000]  i sat here with nightline and the host of abc nightly news and showed him six clips of world leaders
[02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.160]  calling for planetary government world government global governance he looked at me he said alex
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.000]  that's different world government than what you're talking about and then at dinner he admitted look
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.160]  you're not a bad guy like you i just got to do this for my this is the job i do and i just couldn't
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:48.920]  believe that it's just like wow you know yeah that's like that's like judas going to jesus after
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:54.280]  betrayal and say you know uh jesus i i was low on some cash so i just needed 30 pieces of silver
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:59.320]  and forgive me because i really didn't mean it well look betrayals betray how do they sell out so
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:03.560]  easy i mean i don't get how you can put a gun to my head and say kill an innocent child we're
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.960]  gonna kill i'd say pull that freaking trigger i just and it's not that i'm even i just don't get
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:12.840]  why people don't want acceptance i had a hey i gotta share this with you you're gonna love this
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:18.760]  i had a meeting with a russian spy master i won't use his name very cool guy uh set up for me by
[02:17:18.760 --> 02:17:25.240]  a former agent of his uh you know the opposite side he was with the central intelligence agency
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:31.320]  and you know the guy looked at me a very powerful man this is in rino and he said to me he said ah
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:37.320]  you americans he said you betray your country for so little money he says at least when we do
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:43.000]  betray our country we do it for millions you do it for tens of thousands you know and and that spoke
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:48.840]  to me alex because i understood why i mean i'm not saying sell out anything but what i'm telling you
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:57.000]  is this is that when you control all of the uh dialogue when you absolutely give false evidence
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.040]  appearing real that's what fear is obviously an acronym but the point i'm trying to make is
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:07.240]  you know they question our sources we bust our asses forgive the language that would be the
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:12.520]  boroughs that we bring all of our burdens in on just to cover it the point being is we do this we
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:17.960]  go out we do massive amounts of research we spend the money we make and how many times you heard this
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:23.480]  you guys just sound fear to sell your books or to sell your gold you're a fearmonger blah blah
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:29.160]  blah no listen what we're doing is fighting for the last vestiges of humanity yeah normally
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:35.000]  revolutionaries rob banks and stuff you know and i just sell sex slaves you know to fund themselves
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.800]  we sell high quality products fund ourselves and i'm just i just but the good news is the audience
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.680]  gets that's all a load of crap i mean all i want is more money to get more people in a bigger
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:49.800]  organization to fight these people not because i want to be number one but because i wanted to
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:53.720]  beat the new world order that's why i'm so excited behind the scenes to be talking to some of the
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:58.440]  biggest new media out there and to know they're actually patriots and i'm just telling them hey
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:03.800]  you find the people that are better than i am and better crew i'm ready to just just turn my my power
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:10.520]  over to you i am ready right now to step back uh paul watson's maybe halfway there uh but he just
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:15.000]  didn't have the stamina i mean i am ready right now i do not want to do this i do not want to be
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.080]  the tip of the spear i mean i would imagine steve you get exhausted sometimes i mean yeah i mean
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.960]  but but it's a burning isn't it like ezequiel on the bones yeah it's just like fire shut up on
[02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:31.400]  my bones and listen alex i said this i have i had this conversation probably now at least once a week
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:37.560]  for every week i've been on talk radio god are you sure i'm the right guy to be doing this lord
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:41.320]  i have that conversation every day i'll tell you i just want somebody else to come in here
[02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:45.880]  other people are so jealous of other media and it's like it's like they're speaking
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:50.040]  martian to me or something it's like we're not in competition with each other we are we have the
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:57.880]  new world order that wants to literally kill 80 plus percent of the public publicly a huge planet
[02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:03.800]  our sperm counts down over 90 percent but breast cancer is up 3000 percent we're dying we're under
[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:08.680]  attack this is not about who's the biggest this is about defeating the new world order
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:17.880]  we're seeing genocide we're seeing suicide we're seeing fratricide we're absolutely seeing
[02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:21.800]  everything now here's the deal the devil wants to kill every last man woman and child
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:26.520]  the devil wants to destroy the planet so he's got the willing chem trail people enjoying and you
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:32.440]  look at it steve there's no doubt it's the devil the i mean i mean the devil didn't exist then the
[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:37.080]  mass consciousness or whatever the elite does because every they'll go as i said a million
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:42.120]  miles out of their way to screw somebody when it doesn't even help them they're evil sorry they're
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:47.560]  evil and and that's the thing how does evil free will people argue that but here's the deal alex
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:54.440]  the elite are being promised they get off this planet to a new if you will eat and i said that
[02:20:54.440 --> 02:20:59.240]  20 years ago and now ray Kurzweil and all the top google people and all of them say i'm gonna live
[02:20:59.240 --> 02:21:04.040]  forever i'm gonna merge with machines well that's the case then but they go oh but we got to kill
[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:08.840]  all of you first it's like their god tells him you got to kill everybody and when there's a hundred
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:13.720]  of you left we're gonna merge and become gods and blast off to another planet i mean is that i mean
[02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:19.240]  why do they buy into that well they buy into it because they don't ever have to face eternal judgment
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:24.120]  every every headline from the billionaires what's their number one concern to live forever they
[02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:29.160]  got all the money so they're gonna work to live forever number two they're going to be able to
[02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:34.840]  if you will that appetite that you see that they always want more more more the best uh
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:40.360]  definition for lust okay power lust and this is what it's about i had a very rich man once tell me
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:45.720]  steve it's not about the power this was a guy who's dead now he says he said it's not about the
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:52.840]  money he said it's always about the power and control over others lives and he said it it is
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:57.800]  if you will bragging rights when you and the problem is a really powerful man doesn't want to
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:03.160]  run other people's lives he wants to teach them the skills he has yeah absolutely but alex here's
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:08.680]  the deal the most evil jesus said it not and when i say the love of money i'm talking about
[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:12.920]  the control of money the love of money is a root of all evil the control of money
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:16.760]  is a control of all evil when we talk about bankers and we've gone through everything from the
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:22.360]  federal reserve you know community of 300 jackal island all that stuff when it's all said and done
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:27.800]  people are seeing it right now the middle class is dead so what does halloween clinton want to say
[02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:31.880]  she said i'm going to tax the middle class why don't you just come right out and say she wants
[02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:36.440]  them all destroyed turned into soiling green the Rothschilds they released in a magazine review
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:42.680]  three years ago photos of themselves at a castle doing eyes wide shut stuff they're throwing it
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:48.040]  in our face right and and here's the thing that most people don't understand is that when you're
[02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:51.800]  talking about the Rothschilds the rockfellows when you're talking about the most powerful and by the
[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:57.320]  way there's even money people behind the scenes that are as wealthy if not wealthier than they are
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:23:02.120]  their house they're not household names they have me been brought up in our circles but there are
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:07.480]  i mean a lot of it is the black nobility formerly from italy uh right and some other
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:13.480]  Alex it's also fallen angels people don't understand that they're when satan rebelled against god
[02:23:13.480 --> 02:23:19.080]  that literally a third of the angels fell with them and they can't get it through their head that
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:24.040]  even the possible that they can transform themselves as as angels of light they're they're
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:29.800]  they're angels of darkness angel means messenger but the point being is that now we have all the
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:35.160]  transhumanism stuff we've got singularity we've got the work we're getting ready to see heavy duty
[02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:40.120]  stuff yeah and and you know when i wrote my book and i'm i want to make a pitch for this because
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:46.200]  i don't know anybody who tagged genetic armageddon from the christian believing patriot side
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:53.720]  uh earlier than i did okay and and and the same thing is with the book xeno genesis xeno genesis
[02:23:53.720 --> 02:24:00.280]  is my last uh book on that whole subject matter of what man here it is in a nutshell 30 seconds
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:07.240]  they want every man woman and child that is of god creation through their you know ancestors
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:13.480]  dead they want to insert demon possessed robots they've got they're this is going to make uh
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:21.320]  christina steven king's novel seem like really they want to bring on the new man the uber man
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:28.200]  the uber mensh and they want that to be totally void of god they want none of the restraints on
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:35.720]  god they want none of the morality of god what they want is basically a collegial and orgy of
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:42.120]  uh intelligence and and fulfillment for their unbridled lust and it all goes right back to
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.560]  demons that's why there's a story out that susan duclos wrote on my site and she's showing one of
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:53.000]  those cards you know the illuminati card game and i forgot about that card but it's the unleashing of
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:57.560]  demons by the way why don't you that guy literally has his office two miles from mine he will never
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:05.000]  talk to me i've tried for 10 years to talk to him and it is uncanny those cards uh he won't talk to
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:12.600]  me either he i i've tried to now stay well we're almost out of time i yep but alec here let me see
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:18.600]  this our new dvd is really critical it's not just about ancient stuff or else that they who control
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:24.760]  the past you know determine the future i say the greatest cover-up and cover over history is the
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:30.040]  cover-up no it's true legends the series dot com true legends episode two the unholy sea and next
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:34.040]  week we're gonna have you in studio to cover that at least part of the in studio interview uh we're
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:40.440]  gonna play some of those clips here steve quill dot com as well steve listen looking at this it's
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:47.480]  clear these elites are into degeneracy and people think of degeneracy as a guy wanting a hot woman
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:53.320]  or whatever degeneracy is wanting to blow the planet up as a sacrifice wanting to overwrite it
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.640]  being told you're gonna get total power and we see peter teal who i'm not saying is a bad guy he
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:02.440]  doesn't get libertarian things saying he wants to live forever and obsessed with ambrosia and the
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:07.880]  young of the blood and blood transfusions the media is acting like that's something new but the queen
[02:26:07.880 --> 02:26:14.680]  of england's mother before she died for decades would get whole blood whole body blood transfusions
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:21.400]  every month i mean that's that's bbc news what is this a vampiric obsession we're seeing well the
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:26.840]  life is in the blood okay and that's that's a basic premise of christianity that's why
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:31.960]  when jesus shed his blood when people and this is cool this is the cool part of and alec i'm sorry
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:35.800]  that you know you had to go through what you went through but it made you who you are today
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:41.240]  you see what the blood is where the life is so a vampire when he sucks the blood out of something
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:46.040]  he sucks the life out that's what's happened to the economy the vampire economy that's what's happened
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:52.680]  to our lives that's what big uh a medicare and medicaid and they're all doing they're sucking
[02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:58.680]  our blood so here's the answer the answer is for everyone to just ask honestly especially the
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:04.120]  atheists and agnostics jesus if you're real reveal yourself to me because i can tell you this there
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:11.640]  is no place in history and i'm a pretty uh it well it's a verse researcher on that where i can see
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:17.640]  that as it pertains to the people of god when god's people cried out unto the lord he delivered
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:22.840]  them against insurmountable odds and that's why they put in all these state-run fake churches
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:27.240]  that are totally controlled you go in and you feel the spirit of evil the big you know most of the
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:31.400]  megachurches the megachurches isn't evil they try to shut it down those are the good guys folks
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:36.280]  usually when you see that happening and so god understands this obviously that that that so you
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:43.640]  have the blood of christ that you take on spiritually genetically fills you so that you're immune from
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:48.360]  them at least your spirit if not your body and so we have to ask god because god's free will and
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:55.080]  like the devil we have to ask god into us to basically uh transmute us and turn us uh into
[02:27:55.080 --> 02:28:00.120]  something else so that we transcend this well yeah and and and in quantum physics is called
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:06.360]  superposition because the scripture says in jesus christ in him we live and move and have our being
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.920]  and you know we're seated with jesus christ in heavenly places well how does that fit on earth
[02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:15.720]  that's exactly what you just said we're talking about a dimensional ship we're talking about
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:20.200]  let's expand though we have to ask god through the dimension to come into us as god's free will
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:24.840]  in closing in two minutes i remember the new york times when prometheus came out the last alien movie
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:28.040]  and then the brother the director would jump off a cliff the next day or off a bridge a lot of
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:34.760]  weird stuff going on there uh that in that film they in the new york times admitted that this
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:39.800]  trend how we call it transpermia is actually what most elites believe and what genetic engineers
[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:43.720]  believe because they've now looked at the genetics and know that it didn't just accidentally happen
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:47.960]  so secretly they admit that most the globalists in the new york times actually believe we were put
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:54.360]  here by aliens yes and that's what our unholy see the dvd number two is all about it's preparing
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:29:00.120]  the people and the catholic church and because of catholicism i'm catholicism is such a major
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:05.320]  part of the planet uh belief system they're preparing the catholic church is leading the way
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:10.280]  to accept an alien savior and i gotta tell you from all over the world including catholics
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:16.120]  they're saying now i get it they love the unholy see dvd and it's true legends of sir i was in
[02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:20.040]  rome last year and right up there by the Vatican they have a Vatican observatory and the pub says
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:25.640]  get ready for the aliens and because they do a fake alien arrival though yeah well and see
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:31.640]  that's the deal and when in our in our dvd going to mount and by the way alex it's that important
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:38.040]  if you were to say to me okay steve i'm 65 okay just turned 65 last week or two weeks ago the bottom
[02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:44.120]  line is this in my opinion if you take everything i know everything i've done everything i'll stay

[02:30:34.920 --> 02:30:39.960]  around the globe washington examiner reports that opponents have made the case that congress has passed
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:45.080]  legislation to prohibit the federal government from using tax dollars to allow this transition
[02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:49.640]  they point out that the feds are constitutionally prohibited from transferring federal property

[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:17.160]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:27.000]  not to be clear i already knew that the head of bright bart was looking at joining the trump
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:32.680]  campaign two months ago i'm just gonna leave that alone at that bannon reached out to me a few times
[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:38.840]  i was so busy i never got back with him i should have but he now is the head of the campaign but
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:45.320]  this is to bring a lot of internet modern knowledge you know manifold is needed to stop the steel at
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:51.000]  the electoral level and also uh in the general election to watch for fraud he worked for reagan
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:57.400]  you name it a great job so this is not even a demotion for manifold now i made some phone calls
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:01.080]  this morning confirmed all this when i got up and noticed that this announcement had been made
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:06.360]  i heard about a month ago it was being looked at and i want to see if stonk and pop in he's been
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:10.200]  blowing my phone up for an hour i hadn't checked it i guess he's on a phone with nico sending this
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:15.800]  but bannon is awesome great hire a patriot a true nationalist who really understands the
[02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:22.280]  immigration issue not a shakeup no one fired or is leaving hundred percent additive uh
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:26.520]  an addition to manifold it welcomed i mean he wants to help
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:36.360]  and again stone writes for bright bart kelly and conway has uh excellent and solid and awesome and
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:41.480]  trump listens to her these are all anti-new world order patriot globalists it just shows who trump
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:46.600]  is in fact he's been friends with bannon for decades see i mean trump's a sleeper patriot
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:51.880]  that's why they're so pissed they've got a dossier on him uh washington post uh new york times claim
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:56.920]  that it is a demotion for manifold is bs being peddled by loser cori luwandowski the architect
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:02.600]  of trump uh defeat in wisconsin north dakota and colorada new york times attacks undermines trump
[02:35:02.600 --> 02:35:08.360]  campaign manager it is because uh the mexican owner of the times is the largest owner of the clinton
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:16.040]  foundation the whole russia putin trump manifold charges hillary is bogus dnc leaks by uh crucifer
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:21.880]  two and wiki leaks not russians so that's his talking points to me i've never found him to be
[02:35:21.880 --> 02:35:26.360]  inaccurate that guy's he doesn't everybody quotes him in the 80s he said listen my leaks are always
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:30.280]  good because you just might have a fake leak you don't ever get to leak again and so i'm gonna
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:35.880]  just see we get stoned on but there's just major shakeups i want to go to uh joe biggs and others
[02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:40.840]  on the ground about to leave wisconsin covering three days of rioting and the media hyping it when
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:45.640]  there wasn't too much rioting the last few days uh and of course the trump rally last night we've
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:51.240]  got some clips of that but finishing up uh with steve quill who'll be in studio with us for two hours
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:56.040]  on monday steve i've never had a chance to meet you in person uh things have gotten so i know your
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:00.520]  face hadn't hardly been seen in decades to the last year or two and that's why you made these films
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:06.600]  you've decided to go public uh despite security issues i know because i think you understand
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:10.120]  i'm putting words in your mouth but am i right you know we're coming down to the wire so you're
[02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:15.400]  doing your maximum effort absolutely alex so we are at the wire i don't think it's a process
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:22.600]  anymore i think it's a flashpoint now okay and so again uh i want to share every to share with
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:27.640]  your audience and i look forward to meeting you and obviously uh you know and being in studio
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:33.160]  with you and gary but also i i want to thank you for the the team you've put together because
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:38.440]  personally i really like joe biggs i don't know you know i don't know them personally but i think
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:44.040]  you know i think you're hated by the mainstream because you have something that they lost a
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:49.400]  long time ago that's called an investigative journalism and alex when i say that it's a
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:55.000]  genuine compliment people that know me accuse me of being blunt unkind unloving but i don't kiss
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:01.240]  anybody's anything but i believe the bible is it is accurate when it says give credit to whom credit
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:05.960]  do honor to whom ours do and look here's the thing when people you know say whatever they
[02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:11.400]  say to you about me or vice versa or this or that i ask them i said who are you you nameless
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:17.160]  anonymous troll what have you done so i'm really excited you know and and uh i think i've been
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:21.720]  interviewed by uh david and i think i've been i don't know they've ever been interviewed by
[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:28.360]  jakari but the bottom line is i'm excited because look just as and i'm no matt grudge but i want to
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:35.080]  shake your hand and and i'm not you know one of those guys that does something like this if it
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:39.720]  weren't for our mutual friend gary haven i would never probably come to your studio and and it's
[02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:44.360]  not because of you it's just because of all the attendant security issues you know and obviously
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:50.040]  now that that you know that's out there you'll have to take some more uh i've probably this place
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:55.240]  is an arm camp nobody knows where it is yep good but anyway so you know i want to thank you and again
[02:37:55.240 --> 02:38:01.240]  alex i want to i just got to tell you something you know there are millions of people who have
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:06.200]  gotten it i'm getting emails from law enforcement in canada and around the united states that say
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:12.360]  they listen they they're grateful and it's very very humbling but it's scary to be right now
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:17.240]  the storm well i look forward to it's a yeah do you want to be in the eye of a storm okay
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:22.200]  because remember this that that's a good place to be because even elijah the prophet was in the
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:27.960]  eye of the storm and it didn't touch him okay absolutely well steve quill dot com we will
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:32.200]  talk to you next week very rare to have you live in studio anywhere in fact i don't think
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:37.640]  how many decades has it been you've been live in studio somewhere well i can say this probably
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:44.200]  25 years i haven't so just the last six months i have yeah it's it's exactly it's unprecedented
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:49.240]  that at this time you are really getting even more physically active out there in the field
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:55.080]  steve i can't wait to uh to uh sit here with you in studio next week god bless you sir thank you
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:59.720]  alex god bless everybody folks things have escalated with russia right now i'm gonna be
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:04.520]  shooting a special report right after the show uh we're working on getting uh stone can you come on
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:10.200]  at the start of the next hour yeah he's been blowing my phone up and then i got other people
[02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:14.840]  blowing my phone i'm talking about twilight zone the phone call is coming into this phone you can't
[02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:22.760]  make up everybody from total trump the four star generals to to just you name it it is a total
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:29.320]  insane asylum uh and you know i i'm we're about to go to our reporters i am so glad i'm not with
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:35.480]  all those timid souls that sell out i don't want to be accepted by the establishment i don't want
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:41.240]  to be on the big private jet i want to defeat tyranny and stand up to scum that's what i'm looking for
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:45.320]  i want to see the light of liberty in everybody's eyes i want to see
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:51.800]  racial tensions basically brought down to nothing there'll always be some problems
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:59.880]  and i just can't believe that there's so many weird little cowardly yes men and women out there
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:07.080]  who will play along with the system when you know this system's a fraud and is designed to rob you
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:10.680]  of your future uh i'm gonna get i'm gonna go to the crew in about a minute as soon as they're ready
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:14.920]  i see they're getting their cameras set up uh i will go to the crew we got joe biggs right there
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:22.200]  find out which town he's in uh they're in wisconsin they're gonna be coming back soon um he's getting
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:31.880]  a lot of intel from um secret service sources and pentagon sources and if you understand
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:37.320]  with the secret service this is not people we know these are known secret service people
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:42.040]  but then it's vetted through people biggs does know in law enforcement in the military
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:47.560]  and i've got to say this i think there's already been a break with the globalist in
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:55.800]  sent com and in south com and in special operations and in most of homeland security i would say
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:01.400]  from you know the bottom to about 90 up in these organizations people know what's going on
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:07.720]  then you've got globalist operatives above them but what woke up the bottom of the pyramid is
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:12.600]  just how evil their bosses are and when they i mean here's an example when they called in
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:18.360]  then we're gonna go to joe biggs when they called in in missouri and california and in indiana
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:22.760]  in 2008 within two months of obama being elected in 2009
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.000]  they called them in and they said we're gonna have a war with gun owners and veterans and
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:32.440]  christians and conservatives we're gonna ban their speech and we're gonna basically put them in
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:37.240]  reeducation camps there i mean i've seen the video some of these i've been shown and they're not
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:41.560]  allowed to put out other people come here go look at this show me and then go you can't have it
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:48.200]  repeatedly but i've also gotten the documents and some of the training videos you've seen we
[02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:54.360]  broke them where people get up in the meeting you go what the hell george washington's the enemy and
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:58.280]  and we're gonna arrest christians what the hell is this and they're like get out of here
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:04.120]  you're gonna be i mean this is going on folks and that was eight years ago seven and a half
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:12.200]  years ago can you imagine the crazy town stuff going on now so we now go to joe biggs in wisconsin
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:16.040]  to learn about the last 24 hours developments then we'll talk to jacquard jackson there's a lot of
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:22.920]  videos up on info wars.com of weird uh you know supporters of hillary flipping out that quote white
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:27.800]  males would dare talk to them i mean a lot of craziness uh joe biggs thank you for joining us
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:33.480]  exactly where are you now we're actually right down the road from where the initial shooting
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:38.680]  which turned it or which led to the riots on a saturday evening in milwaukee we're actually
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:45.240]  right off of 36 avenue and uh it's called burley so right behind me is a bank that was actually
[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:49.320]  burnt down but if you notice to the right much like ferguson the police department is right beside
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:54.040]  it just like we saw in ferguson where the riots took place there was a police department and a
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:58.760]  fire station right across the street from the mini mall that was burnt and those businesses went down
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:02.680]  there's a number of businesses all around here have been burnt the metro pc s was rated
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:08.920]  why do you think the police stand down i i mean i i don't think it's the police that stand down
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:13.000]  i think it's someone gives the order and if you break that order and then something happens and
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.480]  you're held liable for it or accountable for it so i think someone up top is giving an order and
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:21.720]  the rest of the guys are just sitting in the office like it's kind of like been gauzy you know
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:25.080]  these guys wanted to go out and they're told to stand down told to stand down and then after so
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:29.240]  long they say screw it we're going you know so i don't think the everyday cop is trying to just
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:32.760]  sit here and watch everything no no i get that i'm saying why do you think the stand down was given
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:39.400]  i don't know i i just don't get it maybe just to create more of a a wound for people to see
[02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:43.560]  for the media to publicize it and push it out and other people are going to see it and other
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:48.040]  people are going to get that anger and what it is it's it's a misrepresented anger that these
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:53.320]  young adults have that they don't understand how to deal with these situations well sure
[02:43:53.320 --> 02:43:59.240]  park was on i mean this is a cosmology a mental illness given to them by the leptis media to
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:04.600]  divert them from all the problems of the ghetto yeah it's insane it's going to get worse before
[02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:09.560]  it gets better you know trump came out last night talking about these riots you know and how he's
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:14.680]  going to be the law and order candidate to really step in and squash a lot of this stuff uh really
[02:44:14.680 --> 02:44:19.960]  help out the uh the black community the lgbt community and bring together this uh unity we
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:23.480]  haven't seen in a long time and that's some of the points he was hitting on last night but what
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:28.440]  i do want to talk about uh mainly today is hillary clinton now yesterday there's a lot of footage
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:34.840]  pictures circulating around where she's had to lean up against stools and there was a huge hashtag
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:39.400]  that uh started last night that was trending on twitter called stools for hillary and today in
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:45.400]  cleveland i had some people on the ground at the event there she had no stool uh they when she got
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:50.280]  out of the vehicle they actually let her alone left her alone to try to walk on her own to get in
[02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:55.560]  there kind of to try to prove a point that hey she's okay but at the same time all she does is speak
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:45:02.520]  for a few minutes and meanwhile her vice presidential pick tim can came out today and said this let me
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.120]  pull up the article right now he said white people need to be a minority to know what it's like as
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:11.720]  if just being white inherently is bad oh tim can says the united states is far behind muslim countries
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:18.440]  and treating women equally what wait a minute really saying that treating women are you joking
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:24.360]  negative this is on bright bar right now oh my god this is the most insane thing and that's why
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:30.840]  i said the other day guys why don't we can't we can't oh my god there it is us behind some muslim
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:37.160]  countries and electing women oh my god so they don't cut their genitals over put bags over their heads
[02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:44.040]  what in the hell and that pain guy acts like a total total fruit basket man jacari made a really good
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:48.440]  point earlier he's like the clinton foundation doesn't treat women equally at all they're like
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:53.160]  they don't they only got men and pay the men way more bill bill calls them bimbos when uh they call
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:57.880]  them out on rape you know that's that's insane but that's okay because you know he's from the
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:02.120]  dixie crat and they know probably a clan member and i'm serious when i say that this is a thing
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:07.960]  this is a thing hillary clinton's health is failing fast but he has to sit on a damn chair she can't
[02:46:07.960 --> 02:46:13.880]  even stand up no one if tim kane would have been to the the democratic nominee against trump he would
[02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:18.600]  have never won hillary clinton's a well-known person she's been in politics her whole life
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:25.080]  they have to hold her up long enough to get her in that came guy looks like the most that guy came
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:30.760]  to sell me stuff i'd slam the door in his face he looks like a criminal the establishment knows
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:34.280]  her health is going to fail and she's not going to be able to carry this out and the torch the
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:38.600]  baton is going to be passed on to kane so i think that's where our investigating needs to go from
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:43.240]  here or not that's where our focus needs to be who is tim kane why did the elite want him so bad
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:47.000]  why are they putting him in this position when they know hillary clinton's going to fail why do
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.360]  they need him we know he's involved in a lot of crazy stuff but what is it he wants a tpp he wants
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:56.600]  a lot of this stuff but we need to look into this man i think that's where our focus should be from
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:02.760]  here on out i agree speaking of Trump last night uh at the rally reaching out to uh black folks
[02:47:02.760 --> 02:47:05.640]  here is that clip we'll go back to joe begs and jacquard jackson
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:16.840]  i'm asking for the vote of every african-american citizen struggling in our country today
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:27.880]  who wants a different and much better future it's time for our society to address some
[02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:34.360]  honest and very very difficult truths the democratic party has failed and betrayed
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:42.520]  the african-american community democratic crime policies education policies and economic policies
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:51.000]  have produced only more crime more broken homes and more poverty
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:48:00.440]  we reject the bigotry of hillary clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of
[02:48:00.440 --> 02:48:07.880]  color and sees them only as votes that's all they care about not as individual human beings
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:19.640]  worthy of a better future they have taken advantage she doesn't care at all about the
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:27.640]  hurting people of this country or the suffering she has caused them and she meaning she and her
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:33.240]  party officials there has been tremendous suffering because of what they have brought
[02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:40.440]  what the african-american community has been taken for granted for decades by the democratic
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:46.280]  party and look how they're doing oh yeah it's time to break with the failures of the past
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.600]  oh that's good i want to help us up on info wars dot com and it's true black unemployment's
[02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:54.360]  doubled under obama and the democrats admit we got them we don't have to help them and if
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:58.120]  you're gonna have an economy where you're handing stuff out and helping people and crimes exploding
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:02.680]  in areas you should be spending money in those areas to try to stop that from happening joe
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:06.200]  begs i'm going to come back and finish up with jacari but other points well this is the thing
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:12.840]  look behind me a bank it was burnt down over here tons of stores this is a direct reflection of
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:18.840]  what's going to happen under a hillary clinton presidency more stores burnt more cities in
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:24.600]  distress we go all over the country and we look at all these war torn areas like shy rack this is
[02:49:24.600 --> 02:49:30.760]  a democratic run area poverty stricken tons of violent everywhere they run stuff it's a hell
[02:49:30.760 --> 02:49:38.120]  harder burglaries rape i pulled up an app here that shows uh crime in this area it's all child rape
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:43.640]  10 cases within a by the way tons of child rape again in europe and now they're not even calling
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:48.360]  a muslims when they do it but that's okay because kain said that muslims treat women better than
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:53.880]  we do we're bad because you know you had guilt begs you you and i are bad to women yeah apparently
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:57.480]  you know i go out take him to dinner and you know buy flowers and do all that oh no no no but the
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:03.240]  muslims cutting their genitals off and chaining them up that's okay what's on the upside down world
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:09.160]  is this bastard live in a little smiling face and we had that couple in texas who was pro sharia law
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:13.400]  that had slaves in their home they let you in muslims that are muslims that are part of the
[02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:17.160]  union are allowed to have slaves they're double my community in new york they actually have people
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:23.160]  on in chains they have maids they're on the house with a chain sorry go ahead 30 000 muslims have
[02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:28.600]  already been brought in this year most of which will be pro sharia when you go to these different
[02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:34.200]  countries and you do these polls and you ask them are you pro sharia yes they say yes they say yes
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:39.720]  ask them if they're pro isis most of them say yes in paris france most of them support isis
[02:50:39.720 --> 02:50:44.520]  and they want to bring those same people here 56 that are already support isis something like

[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:09.960]  job with the videos you guys posted a lot of bedlam a lot of craziness folks getting triggered but
[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:13.960]  i'm glad to see things stabilizing winding down the communists weren't too successful
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:19.800]  uh other observations jacari jackson yeah as you guys were talking about i want to dovetail
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:23.640]  really quick on hillary clinton you guys were talking about the war on women and how you know
[02:55:23.640 --> 02:55:27.480]  the treatment of women here in the states there's an article on drugs right now from the guardian
[02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:32.600]  talking about how women are growing in the prison populations that's nothing that's new i remember
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:38.280]  back when i worked in the jail system back in 2012 in oklahoma we had a big female population
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:42.120]  it is a growing thing and many of these people were non violent drug offenders so that's
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:46.840]  something i like to dovetail on now speaking to the situation here in milwaukee we've seen a
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:49.880]  lot of reports people saying that they were threatened and i'm sure there were people
[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:54.200]  who were threatened but we've been out here for three days now uh nobody's threatened us we felt
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:58.360]  very safe but i will say that one thing that a lady told me a little bit ago we were at the
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:03.000]  o'reilly's auto parts store that got burned a few nights ago and there's a lady i think she
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.080]  worked at the facility or she seemed to be very familiar with it and she was saying hey you know
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:10.840]  you guys are reporters you might want to be out out of this area before seven o'clock and i was like
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:15.240]  why is that she says they're not really friendly to people after seven o'clock now maybe she's
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:19.640]  seeing things that i will share a warm reporters attack like monday nine or something yeah there
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:23.160]  there's people who were but you know since we've been out here it's been very peaceful very calm
[02:56:23.160 --> 02:56:27.640]  and uh there's a heavy police presence i'm sure that uh lends to it as well but uh different
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:31.560]  opinions from different people i mean but but imagine the second amendment imagine if that
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.880]  o'reilly auto parts is your business chicari you're gonna be in there cleaning it up night or day
[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:39.480]  you're gonna have a sidearm on your side somebody comes in and attacks you that's their problem
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:44.200]  yeah i mean that's what the second amendment is for they always will say it's about duck hunting
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:47.880]  or they say it's the you know commit crimes so it's to make sure that you don't become a victim
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:51.320]  of a crime and that's why you have a second amendment here the united states of america
[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:55.080]  chicari you've always got interesting perspectives what do you make of hillary do you agree she looks
[02:56:55.080 --> 02:56:59.080]  really sick acting really weird i mean just the last few months and something strange is going on
[02:56:59.080 --> 02:57:03.320]  or do you think maybe she's just getting old her her videos when she goes out to speak or you know
[02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:06.840]  she breaks down these coffee and fits she looks like she had a seizure and that's not even you know
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:10.520]  speaking ill the one she legitimately looks like she has some health problems and when you look at
[02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:15.240]  somebody who's that ill can they really stand the stress the rigors of being a president when
[02:57:15.240 --> 02:57:18.760]  you're constantly criticized you're constantly in the public eye as big as pointed out she needs
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:22.520]  help getting out of her car uh pillows for hillary all this other stuff you know she's

[02:59:01.480 --> 02:59:07.480]  deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food
[02:59:07.480 --> 02:59:12.680]  and adding fluoride the bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen
[02:59:12.680 --> 02:59:18.200]  out and put the deadly halogen in and when the fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening

[03:00:25.800 --> 03:00:33.080]  studios it's alex jones i only use this example because it's so bizarre to me it just hit some
[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:39.320]  weird spot in my brain that both my grandfathers came close to dying in world war two they ever
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:44.680]  wanted to talk about it and then later after they died we got into their army manuals and
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:49.560]  you know graduation yearbooks from the army air corps and the rest of one was a fighter
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:54.520]  pilot one of them was a b-17 pilot my dad's dad would always tell him oh i was just a cook i
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:59.320]  didn't do anything and of course he did his 22 missions out of north africa and idli
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:06.600]  they're in some of the worst air fighting and then he was somebody that ran things as a
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:11.880]  middle-level officer over supply but i could see why i didn't want to talk about it because
[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:15.240]  after he'd flown his missions and then he was he volunteered for more and he got like
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:20.520]  sunstroke basically from not wearing sunglasses burned his corneas and then like a few missions later
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:26.360]  everybody died and the plane blew up you know that was all in the in the literature in the in the in
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:35.880]  the articles and i'm just thinking about implying missions over italy and over eastern europe and
[03:01:35.880 --> 03:01:42.040]  down below is 15 year old george soros rounding up jews and persecuting them and found finding
[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:46.600]  where they're hidden and then doing all this and then it's weird like here i am my grandfathers are
[03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:53.720]  both dead when i'm almost died on a landing in the in the in the fighter plane flipping almost
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:02:02.840]  killing him and i'm sitting here i'm having to fight the weird almost 90 year old creepy nazi
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:09.560]  collaborator and then all these weird leftists are worshiping him and supporting him and love
[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:17.160]  it and think it's cute and make excuses and it's just so surreal it's like what type of world is
[03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:27.640]  this regeneration after generation i'm fighting my family's fighting the same creature because he
[03:02:27.640 --> 03:02:38.200]  was a small part of that then but it's just it's wild to know that roger stone is popping in with
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:41.960]  us in this segment and the next we're about to go to break but roger stone you say you've got
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:47.560]  major breaking news uh dealing with the shakeup in the campaign a bannon the head of bribe art
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:51.800]  has said that it's just an expansion of the campaign but main street media says this is the
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:58.040]  campaign in disarray what's really going on yeah no this that's a total mischaracterization this is
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:03.800]  typical of the mainstream media's attempts to undermine the trump campaign down trump has been
[03:03:03.800 --> 03:03:10.520]  running a campaign with a skeletal staff for some time he has a good national political director
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:15.160]  jim murphy but he's totally immersed in building a national organization particularly in the key
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:23.560]  states uh he has an excellent press operation with hope x and jason miller he has uh he has a
[03:03:23.560 --> 03:03:30.840]  campaign chairman and a campaign deputy uh the clean machine has hundreds of people on the payroll
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:38.280]  so this is two exceptionally talented people kelly and conway who i think donald uh and avanca
[03:03:38.280 --> 03:03:46.440]  uh have a great confidence in uh who has a special expertise and knowledge about women voters uh a
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:53.000]  friend of mine from lives in my native state of connecticut uh and uh steve bannon who like you
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:59.720]  and i alex is a nationalist who believes in that so patriots got added to the whole deal
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:04.280]  and the media spends it into some type of defeat that he's adding some heavy hitters no look at
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:10.200]  and uh there's no question that bannon like me is an advocate for an outsider strategy
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:14.600]  trump needs to take on the two-party duopoly including those at the republic so it's accurate
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:21.960]  to say the brass knuckles are going on right now well i mean in all honesty a week ago the republican
[03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:28.200]  national committee spokesman entertains a question from the press saying what are you cutting off
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:34.200]  the presidential candidates uh financing and support and instead of saying absolutely out of
[03:04:34.200 --> 03:04:40.520]  the question he says that the decision will make in october that is treasonous that's not the role
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:44.200]  of the republican national and this is donald trump who's raising the money for me some grateful
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:49.800]  little neocon bastards well this is what you get when you make peace with the rhinos they undermine
[03:04:49.800 --> 03:04:55.240]  you i happen to know a major major republic no honor among thieves stay there roger we're gonna
[03:04:55.240 --> 03:05:00.200]  give you the floor for one segment i know you're busy when we come back get ready roger is hot stay
[03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:08.600]  with us donald trump says hillary clinton lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on isis
[03:05:08.600 --> 03:05:14.520]  and other foreign threats to the us questions about hillary's health are intensifying after the
[03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:21.640]  release of a viral info wars video asking why she's been behaving so strange during the campaign
[03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:27.800]  what on earth could be the reason behind hillary clinton's bizarre behavior in recent weeks weird
[03:05:27.800 --> 03:05:35.960]  seizures psychotic facial tics over exaggerated reactions coughing fix strange lesions on her
[03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:41.800]  tongue is hillary on the verge of a mental breakdown due to stress or are her strange
[03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:47.240]  outbursts linked to a medical condition the speeches are so short though they don't last long
[03:05:47.240 --> 03:05:51.800]  you know they're like 10 minutes let's get out of here go back home and go to sleep meanwhile
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:05:58.680]  leftist media outlets are portraying the issue as a faceless conspiracy theory and you can learn

[03:08:08.520 --> 03:08:22.360]  because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:33.640]  all right paul watson is hosting right now but i'm over into the fourth hour because roger stone's
[03:08:33.640 --> 03:08:37.560]  here with breaking news paul watson jumping anytime was about to be hosting the show in about 10
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:42.520]  minutes anytime you want roger stone former head of the trump campaign his former business
[03:08:42.520 --> 03:08:47.400]  partner was the head of it now still major part of it but they brought in banan the head of
[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:52.200]  bright barred who's known as a real street fighter and the word is that if you think trump took the
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:57.880]  gloves off the last month get ready for brass knuckles to be put onto those uh fists so let's
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:09:05.560]  talk about what this really means roger stone uh alex i look i think this is a giant plus for
[03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:13.480]  the trump campaign uh steve banan is a is a street fighter he is a nationalist he understands the
[03:09:13.480 --> 03:09:20.280]  immigration issue particularly well uh he is hardline anti-islamic terrorists and radical
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:28.840]  muslims uh he is uh skeptical uh he's not a neocon uh he very much understands the globalists
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:34.920]  so the enemy here uh to democracy to freedom uh he's not a fan of george soros to say the
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:42.440]  least so i share his worldview very much uh he is also very successful executive who really
[03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:48.600]  understands the new media which is uh going to be important for trump's candidacy he's not
[03:09:48.600 --> 03:09:55.320]  replacing paul manifork he is not he is not uh uh there's a shake up it's an expansion and he said
[03:09:55.320 --> 03:10:00.440]  that he's augmenting things so see at the new york times in the washington post and most likely
[03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:07.160]  being propped up by sydney blumenthal uh and uh cori luandowski trying to write this is some
[03:10:07.160 --> 03:10:14.920]  kind of a shake up when trump expands his campaign with two more pros because many hands make work
[03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:21.160]  light i mean this is the presidential sure hillary has 500 people trump has a 50 but but uh doesn't
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:24.920]  i'm getting on the luandowski for me because i i mean obviously he's he's old news but
[03:10:24.920 --> 03:10:29.240]  he really is out there tweeting against manifurred he really is like a benedict arnold i mean
[03:10:29.800 --> 03:10:34.600]  maybe trump should come out and say i only want best what's best for mr trump in the campaign
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:40.920]  attacking trump's campaign manager is not helpful to the campaign the guys allow i mean he just has
[03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:47.240]  it no no sense of this seems to scare the mainstream media some people are in this to elect trump
[03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:54.120]  others are measuring the curtains for their next job it's very it's pathetic uh exactly so so so
[03:10:54.120 --> 03:11:00.920]  this is a big plus though uh having ban on board i think uh it's uh it's terrific and kelly an is
[03:11:00.920 --> 03:11:08.360]  the is uh is an experience pro and they work well with uh manifurred uh and his very skilled deputy
[03:11:08.360 --> 03:11:14.280]  rick gate the very capable guy who helps keep the trains on time uh and i think they all have a
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:20.040]  good relationship with the trump children who are the greatest assets of this campaign i mean i don't
[03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:26.200]  know why the media is so fixed on the internal workings of our campaign could they just focus
[03:11:26.200 --> 03:11:33.560]  on the content of trump's speeches oh that's all point that's all point tough and the scrutiny if
[03:11:33.560 --> 03:11:40.440]  they would put the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative scams because they're
[03:11:40.440 --> 03:11:45.000]  they're slush funds for grifters they're not legitimate charities they're breaking more
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:50.760]  charity laws than you can imagine they are vehicles for the facilitation of multi-million
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:57.480]  dollar bribes for from china from russia from saudi but the new york times isn't interested
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:04.120]  in that instead they they cook up a fabricated story and put it on page one about paul maniford's
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:09.480]  perfectly legal dealings in ukraine where he ran a campaign it never worked for the ukrainian
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:14.600]  government there is no investigation he is not the subject of an investigative investigation
[03:12:14.600 --> 03:12:20.280]  there is no evidence against him that's admissible in any court there's no evidence that he took any
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:26.920]  12 million dollars in payments this is a this is a hit job it certainly is incidental that the
[03:12:26.920 --> 03:12:33.640]  owner of the new york times is the largest single donor a mexican citizen uh against and again didn't
[03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:38.760]  they say we're against mexicans no what is some mexican kingpan the richest guy in the world
[03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:45.240]  arguably connected to all this corruption doing owning the new york times writing all these these
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:50.360]  hit pieces i mean i mean if i own some giant newspaper in mexico and i'm up here in texas
[03:12:50.360 --> 03:12:55.960]  the mexicans will be like shut up gringo and they should like what are you doing i cannot tell you
[03:12:55.960 --> 03:13:03.400]  how many reporters in the mainstream media said they read the times above the page page one story
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:10.680]  above the fold story and said this is a nothing burger they covered themselves five times by saying
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:17.800]  manifold who's not the subject of the investigation it was a it was a total fabrication so uh
[03:13:17.800 --> 03:13:24.520]  meanwhile the times does not dig into the very serious ongoing crimes at the clinton foundation
[03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:31.160]  i'm talking about things that have transpired since peter schweitzer wrote his terrific book
[03:13:31.800 --> 03:13:38.200]  clinton cash so ongoing criminal conspiracies i want to bring paul watson in his hosting this
[03:13:38.200 --> 03:13:43.080]  hour uh don't be timid paul come in here and any comments or questions for roger stone i've got a
[03:13:43.080 --> 03:13:49.400]  few more now i think with a bannon situation alex there was a headline in bloomberg business week
[03:13:50.120 --> 03:13:56.280]  back in october this man is the most dangerous political operative in america that was before
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:14:00.440]  he was even officially on board with the trump campaign and you know why he's influential he's
[03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:06.200]  smart he basically sounds like alex jones well that's why i had to send out on tweet a congratulations
[03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:10.680]  Steve bannon however you are the second most dangerous man in america politics
[03:14:13.320 --> 03:14:20.920]  bannon is a good friend of mine uh and he was actually featured uh in last year's international
[03:14:20.920 --> 03:14:29.080]  best and worst dressed list as one of the worst dressed men in america and he loved it because
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:35.000]  i explained this is a guy who was so concerned about saving the country so concerned about
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:42.440]  saving america that he eats at his computer this guy is a workaholic uh in a whirlwind of
[03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:48.280]  i was emailing this morning worry about worldly crap like that just get me a hamburger he was
[03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:53.480]  responding in real time and i talked to somebody else in the office that was talking to him while
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:59.240]  he was real time while i'm talking to him on email yeah no look because so the guy is he is he is
[03:14:59.240 --> 03:15:07.800]  he is a whiz and he understands the new media i am by the way uh paul a huge paul watson fan i love
[03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:14.840]  your writing and some of the investigative stuff you do it's terrific absolutely other stuff on the
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:18.760]  radar and then i know you're busy i'm gonna let you go roger and i want to turn this over to paul
[03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:23.400]  what else is going on i mean obviously so much is happening we've got on fox news political science
[03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:28.920]  professor has been right about five or six elections says 87 let me say let me say this the clinton's
[03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:37.080]  activities in haiti post or post earthquake are about to blow in a big way this will reveal corruption
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:43.240]  that will be stunning to the american people well it's now they stole more than half the
[03:15:43.240 --> 03:15:47.000]  money for themselves and then she gave 97 percent of the money that she gives the foundation to
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:54.680]  herself but let's remember previously their their defense on all of this is you have no proof oh so
[03:15:56.040 --> 03:16:01.160]  all i'm going to say is i think the haiti scandal will blow sky high good and the next week
[03:16:01.800 --> 03:16:06.440]  no well sometime in the very near future okay let's expand the great thing is the truth can't
[03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:13.320]  be suppressed anymore i understand that in the 80s the clinton's could lean on uh uh uh uh news
[03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:21.160]  organizations i wrote a piece on voter rigging for the hill and the hill has come under intense
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:27.480]  pressure from the censors david block the self-appointed censor who's operating illegally
[03:16:27.480 --> 03:16:33.480]  under his tax data coming under censorship from some serial killer or something i mean demanding
[03:16:33.480 --> 03:16:39.480]  that we not publish the writings of roger stone why why are you a poet well let people decide for
[03:16:39.480 --> 03:16:43.720]  themselves let them read my why are you banned on everything because you do link to stanford
[03:16:43.720 --> 03:16:49.640]  research saying it's rigged and cbs news saying it's rigged you're pissed my my piece is thoroughly
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:54.840]  footnoted uh let readers decide for themselves whether i'm full of bull or whether i make a good
[03:16:54.840 --> 03:17:00.360]  case i'm telling you the machines can't been re-rigged easily i'm telling you you can use a
[03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:06.520]  fifteen dollar advice you can get at radio shack or best buy to vote multiple times on these machines
[03:17:06.520 --> 03:17:11.160]  without detection sure let me throw this out because we're almost out of time i'm telling
[03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:16.040]  that this i actually think that that both parties have rigged the machines in major
[03:17:16.040 --> 03:17:20.040]  contests in the last several years let me throw this curveball at you roger it's almost out of
[03:17:20.040 --> 03:17:25.000]  time here i want to pull that one more question the situation with hillary's health i mean i don't
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:29.080]  just hype and she looks really sick because oh that'll get her out of the race we've got videos
[03:17:29.080 --> 03:17:33.480]  and stuff where she has to be helped up now not just the photo drug show but secret service
[03:17:33.480 --> 03:17:38.200]  holding her up her having to sit on a chair she heard toddling around she's obviously
[03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:44.200]  degenerating quickly we can scroll through the article uh hillary stuels hashtag a new article
[03:17:44.200 --> 03:17:48.200]  plenty using chairs as crutches and countless speeches you scroll down it shows a secret
[03:17:48.200 --> 03:17:53.080]  service having to hold her up i mean she's just sitting on a toilet or something maybe changing
[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:59.240]  her diaper what's going on here i don't think that she is well uh we remember we have the sworn
[03:17:59.240 --> 03:18:06.360]  testimony of uh whom i have been saying she's easily confused uh she is uh uh i don't think
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:13.880]  she's in good health i don't know what what the the degenerative disease she has is i've seen
[03:18:13.880 --> 03:18:20.200]  various physicians write their theories uh based on appearance and other symptoms but
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:26.520]  none of them of course have examined them uh uh uh she does not look well to me her whole
[03:18:26.520 --> 03:18:32.920]  campaign is style is based around the fact that she has no stamina this is why we have no press
[03:18:32.920 --> 03:18:39.240]  conference in 200 but then she says it's okay we say she has no stamina she has no stamina she said
[03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:43.560]  last week she could barely get up if she lays down she can't get back up but it's a total
[03:18:43.560 --> 03:18:49.880]  conspiracy theory that she has no stamina and that she's sleeping well i understand that so one has to
[03:18:49.880 --> 03:18:57.160]  uh hope that in the campaign that the rigors of the campaign uh will demonstrate this more and more
[03:18:57.160 --> 03:19:05.800]  to the american voters beyond that uh you know i'm not i understand the intricacy of losing
[03:19:05.800 --> 03:19:11.640]  sympathetic female voters if you raise this in the wrong way but my guess is that the american
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:17.160]  people will catch on to this by in the next 90 days we've already caught on to it the non-elite
[03:19:17.160 --> 03:19:22.680]  media has already figured this out uh it's only a matter of time before the voters figure it out
[03:19:23.880 --> 03:19:27.560]  well i'm glad that trump is weighing in on this let's play that short clip in the final question
[03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:31.720]  from watson i'm going to hand the baton to watson here with roger stones who's who's got to go uh
[03:19:31.720 --> 03:19:35.880]  here's trump a few days ago talking about uh hillary and the big question is is umad abedin
[03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:42.680]  actually the groom of the stool hillary clinton has supported tax increases on the middle class
[03:19:42.680 --> 03:19:50.360]  for her entire career she's voted for higher taxes 235 times in the senate i thought it was more than
[03:19:50.360 --> 03:19:57.080]  that that doesn't sound think of it she's right she's voted for tax increases and by the way
[03:19:57.080 --> 03:20:03.880]  she's proposing a big one today in her speech her teleprompter speech she's got a she's got
[03:20:03.880 --> 03:20:16.840]  her speeches are so short though they don't last long you know they're like 10 minutes let's get
[03:20:16.840 --> 03:20:25.800]  out of here go back home and go to sleep three days later she gets up and she does another one
[03:20:25.800 --> 03:20:36.680]  and goes back home and goes to sleep oh boy his ice is hoping for her is china hoping
[03:20:36.680 --> 03:20:43.560]  can you imagine china they come in they have a negotiate with the chinese they're tough they're
[03:20:43.560 --> 03:20:52.280]  tough you got to hit them back with a lot of energy i just don't see her winning in closing
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:20:55.960]  them to let you go uh roger i appreciate your time stonezone.com we have the clinton rape
[03:20:55.960 --> 03:21:00.200]  chart that you designed available exclusively at forestore.com that helps funder operation
[03:21:00.200 --> 03:21:06.920]  and what you're doing what do you make of uh us today app maker trump will win saying their people
[03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:12.040]  are way more trump than hillary a political science professor trump is 87 winning he's been
[03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:17.640]  right about at least five maybe six elections uh social media partners a pattern show trump is
[03:21:17.640 --> 03:21:22.200]  looking at landslide victory i'm going to see the grass roots the crowds the people i just
[03:21:23.480 --> 03:21:30.440]  it's more evidence that these polls like roiders are rigged to show her further ahead or ahead
[03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:37.000]  when she's not there's clearly no energy surrounding her campaign she's drawing tiny crowds the media
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:43.000]  has to endeavor to shoot the event in a way to make it look like there's more people than there are
[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:50.280]  trump is bringing record crowds everywhere he goes uh at the end of the day i still argue between
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:56.760]  a voter fraud which is not non-existent as the left says but somewhat limited you're still
[03:21:56.760 --> 03:22:02.360]  going to have efforts to vote many illegal immigrants uh in the machine run democratic
[03:22:02.360 --> 03:22:08.760]  states and as i have posited these machines are quite easy to rig and indeed there's evidence
[03:22:08.760 --> 03:22:15.640]  that they have been rigged before this is why uh i'm organizing the project to do exit polls in
[03:22:15.640 --> 03:22:21.240]  pennsylvania and in probably virginia well we're going to be back up but i'm going to say this i
[03:22:21.240 --> 03:22:27.880]  got in a row i got interrupted you said it roiders us offers states help to fight election hacking
[03:22:27.880 --> 03:22:32.760]  that's roiders with jade johnson i thought obama said two weeks ago or a week and a half ago he
[03:22:32.760 --> 03:22:36.920]  doesn't even know what election fraud is now suddenly they say it's a major issue you were on
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:42.440]  here last week and or monday you said you were more worried about the federal elections people
[03:22:42.440 --> 03:22:46.120]  doing the hacking than anybody else and now they're announcing it roger final comment
[03:22:46.840 --> 03:22:53.720]  yeah no i think we know the we know the rubric here and how this works first you you set an
[03:22:53.720 --> 03:22:59.560]  expectation with the polls and then between voter fraud and election theft which are two
[03:22:59.560 --> 03:23:04.920]  completely different things voter fraud involves people voting multiple times people who are not
[03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:11.480]  eligible to vote voting illegal immigrant voting and election manipulation pardon me machine
[03:23:11.480 --> 03:23:18.120]  manipulation this election can be heisted uh and there's several ways to combat that
[03:23:19.160 --> 03:23:23.800]  some third party a truly independent party should be allowed to look at the software
[03:23:24.360 --> 03:23:29.880]  for these machines before on the eve of the election but jade johnson says he's going to
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:34.680]  hook up some special stuff to make sure it's all accurate yeah right look when the president
[03:23:34.680 --> 03:23:40.040]  came out and said the idea of a voter fraud and election theft was ridiculous that was the
[03:23:40.040 --> 03:23:45.000]  instant in which i knew they were going to try it in fact i don't we got to find the clip you
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:49.160]  actually said whether it was last week or monday when we brought this up you said watch watch out
[03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:52.040]  they're going to send people that's what you got to watch and then sure enough they're doing
[03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:58.840]  yeah i look i i think there's a number of ways to both discourage the theft of this election
[03:23:58.840 --> 03:24:07.000]  into into documented this is not as someone on the left want to say trump positioning himself
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:13.960]  so that no matter the circumstances of his losing if he loses he can say that it was stolen no
[03:24:13.960 --> 03:24:20.760]  he has to have solid evidence that there is a fact of evidence of voter fraud or evidence of
[03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:28.280]  machine manipulation that can be collected and i think for to protect the the security
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:33.160]  and honesty of this election it's incumbent on we're going to do it together we're going to do it
[03:24:33.160 --> 03:24:36.200]  together and you're absolutely right look they claimed he was being a sore loser when his winning
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:41.320]  primaries and he was contesting it but he won because he contested bernie didn't he lost so
[03:24:41.320 --> 03:24:47.080]  michael moore and and quomo son they can all go to hell stonezone.com thank you so much roger
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:50.440]  great to be with you there he goes all right paul's already cut into your time and they got a big
[03:24:50.440 --> 03:24:55.240]  guest coming up right after the break uh but paul epic times be alive my friend from her
[03:24:55.240 --> 03:25:03.480]  britannic majesties london england i hand the baton to america's favorite redcoat paul joseph
[03:25:04.360 --> 03:25:11.800]  whatson what an introduction alex i don't know if i can live up to that um introduction there
[03:25:11.800 --> 03:25:18.120]  but i'll try you were talking about the polls and again we had the article up today i think
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:23.720]  was out of liberty blitzkrieg these polling organizations are left-wing they're biased
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:28.760]  most of them there are a couple of notable exceptions but we tried to do polls on different
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:35.960]  issues over the past few years some of these polling agencies refuse to even take our money
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:41.720]  because we weren't aligned with them politically that's how biased they are i forgot about that
[03:25:41.720 --> 03:25:45.560]  because i used to do polls like 15 years ago they would try to screw you but now they just go no
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:50.760]  no we don't do that again yeah we got to call up record i'm doing it ought to go to new york with
[03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:56.680]  a hidden camera and show it it wasn't even about a conservative liberal issue it was about the tsa
[03:25:56.680 --> 03:26:01.320]  and this one left-wing polling organization said no we're not even going to take your money
[03:26:01.320 --> 03:26:06.520]  which goes to the heart of it which is their bias so you look at bloomberg you look at reuters
[03:26:06.520 --> 03:26:10.840]  they ask people who are you going to vote for people say i'm not going to vote for either
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:16.200]  trump or hillary and they refuse to take that as an answer they say no you have to choose one are
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:22.440]  you going to vote hill for hillary it's going to be hillary isn't it and then they say okay let's get
[03:26:22.440 --> 03:26:28.440]  ready to rumble sorry i'm out of here now paul must stop playing mr. microphone here
[03:26:29.960 --> 03:26:34.360]  so they they pressure them over and over again even though they've told the polling agency
[03:26:34.360 --> 03:26:40.040]  they're not going to vote for either trump or clinton they say but what if you did vote would it be
[03:26:40.040 --> 03:26:44.600]  for hillary would it would it would it would it be for hillary they eventually relent and say yes
[03:26:44.600 --> 03:26:49.800]  it would be for hillary even though they're not going to vote they take all those answers and
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:54.520]  include them in favor of hillary paul you're not saying you have a rigging thing already don't you
[03:26:55.400 --> 03:27:00.360]  oh it's just an outrageous conspiracy theory so reuters had trump marginally ahead they included
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:03.800]  all the people who are not going to vote and said oh no they're actually going to vote for hillary
[03:27:03.800 --> 03:27:08.040]  even though they said i'm not going to vote and that's how hillary has the lead in these polls
[03:27:08.040 --> 03:27:13.960]  and that's just what they're telling us bro yeah and then you've got the more accurate online polls
[03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:19.960]  which show trump is far far closer to hillary and it's this whole social stigma thing you know trump
[03:27:19.960 --> 03:27:24.360]  is literally hitler all of a sudden so people aren't going to say on the phone yes i'm going
[03:27:24.360 --> 03:27:31.080]  to vote for trump but it's like brexit all the polls for brexit beforehand were wrong they showed
[03:27:31.080 --> 03:27:37.800]  that the remain vote was clearly ahead by five six oh yeah i really hate the west though they were
[03:27:37.800 --> 03:27:42.120]  all wrong they were all completely wrong because people paul side issue i'm gonna let you take

[03:27:57.960 --> 03:28:06.840]  having dinner with carl the cock oh that'd be incredible if you could get triglypuff in there
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:12.600]  then that'd be um quite the event but what was it five thousand dollars i think you've got to go higher
[03:28:12.600 --> 03:28:18.600]  but again these people have been offering them 20 a piece their lives have been literally turned

[03:33:44.680 --> 03:33:52.120]  everywhere that hillary goes every speech she gives she needs to be literally propped up by pillows
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:59.000]  if you saw the video yesterday her visit to joe biden's house literally struggling to even walk
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:06.040]  up the drive holding on to railings holding on to the table this is a major issue it's a major
[03:34:06.040 --> 03:34:12.440]  cover-up the mainstream media is panicking about hillary's health and of course for the past couple
[03:34:12.440 --> 03:34:19.000]  of weeks they've relied on that old adage of this is just a conspiracy theory daily beast which of
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:25.400]  course is a clinton mouthpiece came out and attacked me attacked mike cernovich said oh you
[03:34:25.400 --> 03:34:30.520]  don't have any experts you don't have any health professionals even though in my original video
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:35.880]  which has now got three million views i named all the neurologists all the doctors all the health
[03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:41.560]  experts that circulated these suspicions these concerns in the first place but they said no
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:47.320]  chris haze of msnbc said no this is just a naughty conspiracy theory well now we've got
[03:34:47.320 --> 03:34:55.880]  dr drew who is known as america's most trusted physician again board certified medicine specialist
[03:34:55.880 --> 03:35:01.960]  an active physician coming out and saying that he's gravely concerned about hillary's health
[03:35:01.960 --> 03:35:07.640]  coming out and saying that she has brain damage that the drugs that she's being given are causing
[03:35:07.640 --> 03:35:14.360]  all these quote weird side effects so again that's not me saying it that's not conspiracy theorists
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:21.800]  on the dark corners of the internet saying it that's america's most trusted position to add to the
[03:35:21.800 --> 03:35:26.600]  names of all the other health experts who have come out and said the same thing this is not a
[03:35:26.600 --> 03:35:33.320]  conspiracy theory we have noted professionals all saying the same thing that there are major
[03:35:33.320 --> 03:35:40.360]  problems with hillary's health and the videos the photos only continue to confirm that so another
[03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:46.600]  individual who's been hot on the trail of this big controversy over the last few weeks is mike
[03:35:46.600 --> 03:35:54.040]  cernovich author writer and social media pariah to the left the book is gorilla mindset i have it
[03:35:54.040 --> 03:36:02.840]  right here mike welcome to the show hey thanks for having me on so mike again the media were obsessed
[03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:09.400]  with you know john mccain's health back in 2008 they forced him into releasing his medical records
[03:36:09.960 --> 03:36:15.880]  this time around they're attacking anyone who asks the same questions about hillary calling them
[03:36:15.880 --> 03:36:21.160]  conspiracy theorists why is being concerned about presidential candidates ill health
[03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:29.000]  only a baseless conspiracy theory when they're a democrat explain that to me one of the people
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:34.920]  even sent me in a link where they were asking for mit romney's health records too including his
[03:36:34.920 --> 03:36:40.440]  psychiatric records so it not only did the liberal media go after john mccain's records
[03:36:40.440 --> 03:36:48.280]  they also went after mit romney's records now why are they doing this well the dnc leaks proved it
[03:36:48.280 --> 03:36:53.160]  it proved what you and i and others have said for years people like alex jones other pioneers have
[03:36:53.160 --> 03:37:00.120]  said for decades which is the media takes its marching orders from the democratic national
[03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:08.280]  committee and dnc leaks prove that i mean literally daily beast they attacked me they attacked you on
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:14.200]  the same day they attacked you on a different issue but this is a company that is owned by an
[03:37:14.200 --> 03:37:21.240]  organization whose board of directors includes chelsea clinton it's literally a clinton mouthpiece
[03:37:21.240 --> 03:37:26.920]  and yet today for example they have the temerity to come out and say oh donald trump is hiring somebody
[03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:32.760]  who you know sits on the on this media organization that's been a mouthpiece for trump since the
[03:37:32.760 --> 03:37:38.440]  beginning when they're literally the same thing for hillary clinton now chris mathews came out i
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:45.400]  think it was last night he questioned hillary's health the left went absolutely not they tried
[03:37:45.400 --> 03:37:51.960]  to put him back in his box merely for raising the issue we've got you know us news and will report cnn
[03:37:51.960 --> 03:38:00.120]  saying oh hillary's physician a year ago told us that hillary was completely fine so like that's
[03:38:00.120 --> 03:38:05.480]  an impartial independent source and yet we've got all this new evidence that she's got major health
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:11.800]  problems we've got dr drew coming out today saying that he's gravely concerned about it again hardly
[03:38:11.800 --> 03:38:19.400]  a right-wing extremist dr drew now you started the trend last night on twitter hillary's stools
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:27.480]  tell us about that yeah big picture is we have the media shook because we create news cycles if we
[03:38:27.480 --> 03:38:32.360]  want something to be news the media they try to ignore it they can't ignore anymore and that's why
[03:38:32.360 --> 03:38:37.640]  they're trying to dismiss us as conspiracy conspiracy theorists because they won't debate us i heard
[03:38:37.640 --> 03:38:43.320]  alex jones even saying earlier in the segment i'm offering these people twenty thousand dollars
[03:38:43.320 --> 03:38:49.800]  to come on to my show for two hours ten thousand an hour man i you know i do okay in life i wish i
[03:38:49.800 --> 03:38:54.920]  was getting ten thousand ten thousand dollars an hour to come on somebody's show and they won't
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:39:00.040]  debate us because they know that the truth is on our side so what we did with hillary stools was
[03:39:00.680 --> 03:39:06.280]  a reader pointed out to me um she said i went to this rally and i noticed that hillary was always
[03:39:06.280 --> 03:39:11.800]  leaning back on this school um this stool and she sent me pictures and then suddenly i was like holy
[03:39:11.800 --> 03:39:18.120]  shit and i tweeted it out people said yeah everywhere she goes now there's a stool that she has to
[03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:24.840]  lean on a leaning stool so we held a live periscope session fifteen thousand people showed up and we
[03:39:24.840 --> 03:39:29.880]  came up with the hashtag hillary stools which ended up being the number one trending hashtag
[03:39:29.880 --> 03:39:37.160]  on twitter before the night was over again a testament to the power of just you as an independent
[03:39:37.160 --> 03:39:43.320]  reporter on this taking that issue turning it into a viral hashtag within a matter of minutes
[03:39:43.320 --> 03:39:49.000]  and the other aspect of that of course which proves your point is this weird handler this
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:55.400]  black guy who initially was her medical assistant then the media claimed he was a secret service
[03:39:55.400 --> 03:40:01.560]  agent we drew attention to that to the fact that he was you know basically hypnotizing her on stage
[03:40:01.560 --> 03:40:07.400]  when she had these three counts after being confronted he seems to have mysteriously disappeared
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:13.960]  correct yeah and the stools have disappeared too and the the psyops campaign i'm very overt about
[03:40:13.960 --> 03:40:19.320]  what i do i'm running the psyops campaign we're making it now so hillary can't have her little
[03:40:19.320 --> 03:40:24.520]  precious stool to lean on she's not traveling with her hypnotist that is going to lead to fatigue
[03:40:24.520 --> 03:40:30.360]  so we can expect more unforced errors from hillary now the the mainstream media is freak out to this
[03:40:30.360 --> 03:40:35.800]  is evidence that we're on to something they all know that hillary's sick because they travel with
[03:40:35.800 --> 03:40:40.040]  her they're on the airplanes with her they're with her every day that's why they're freaking out
[03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:44.840]  that's why again the daily beast they did a hit job on you they did a hit job on me to try to get me
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:51.320]  banned from tv bringing up out of context tweets from five years ago that's how desperate they are
[03:40:51.320 --> 03:40:56.680]  that's all they can do they can't address our arguments so they try to discredit us discredit
[03:40:56.680 --> 03:41:01.480]  us but it doesn't matter we're winning we're getting our information out it truly is an
[03:41:01.480 --> 03:41:07.240]  information war and finally for the first time in a very long time people like us are winning
[03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:14.200]  i mean you're trailblazing on this issue and that's that's very apparent what i've been told
[03:41:14.200 --> 03:41:20.520]  privately is that you know we had people out there ready today to get the footage from relatively
[03:41:20.520 --> 03:41:24.520]  close up of her getting out of the vehicle because of course we were told by a secret
[03:41:24.520 --> 03:41:29.800]  service source that they've spent around half a million dollars on these three suvs to lower the
[03:41:29.800 --> 03:41:35.800]  floor to provide some kind of disabled access so we were going to get pretty close get some photos
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:41.080]  get some videos of that today they changed the route in which hillary arrived to whatever location
[03:41:41.080 --> 03:41:47.080]  she's at today to avoid media attention so as he said with the stool they've taken away the stool
[03:41:47.080 --> 03:41:55.240]  the weird handler who had the injection syringe who calmed her on stage he's disappeared so while we
[03:41:55.240 --> 03:42:00.040]  have the clinton campaign and in fact they came out yesterday to the washington post and said
[03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:05.640]  this is a debunked conspiracy theory how dare donald trump glom onto this this is right wing
[03:42:05.640 --> 03:42:11.480]  conspiracy theory well if it's a conspiracy theory why are you changing your behavior why have you
[03:42:11.480 --> 03:42:17.080]  removed the stool why have you removed the handler they're obviously really sensitive to this mic
[03:42:17.080 --> 03:42:21.880]  which suggests that there is some kind of cover-up going on do you think that they'll be forced at
[03:42:21.880 --> 03:42:28.840]  some point to release some kind of medical record to try and dismiss this whole thing right now
[03:42:28.840 --> 03:42:34.120]  they're trying to figure out a way to spend it and i think they'll try to make a sympathy play
[03:42:34.120 --> 03:42:39.400]  and they'll say oh hillary did have some kind of health problems and now these people are
[03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:45.480]  right wing bullies can you believe so what we'll do is we'll go from conspiracy theorists to they'll
[03:42:45.480 --> 03:42:51.800]  call us bullies next and try to make her like the left always does appear like a victim however that
[03:42:51.800 --> 03:42:57.240]  has perils and pitfalls because as i'm fond of saying pity doesn't get you votes and pity doesn't
[03:42:57.240 --> 03:43:02.600]  get you you know laid either so just because people feel sorry for you and feel like you're
[03:43:02.600 --> 03:43:07.080]  being bullied that doesn't mean that they're actually going to vote for so again the media
[03:43:07.080 --> 03:43:13.400]  is so shook by this because they know that we're right they're covering things up a good example
[03:43:13.400 --> 03:43:19.560]  of that was to remember the hillary you know the seizure thing when ap journalist journalist
[03:43:20.360 --> 03:43:25.880]  said oh i was there and i didn't think anything was unusual but i think it was either you or
[03:43:25.880 --> 03:43:31.160]  stefan malin you posted the image of as it happened that that same so-called journalist was like this
[03:43:31.160 --> 03:43:38.760]  what she completely freaked out right completely yeah she came out and said oh it was nothing out
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:43.560]  of the ordinary that hillary had this seizure that went on for like a minute and then the mainstream
[03:43:43.560 --> 03:43:50.440]  media ms mbc came out and said oh i slowed down the footage i edited the footage to make it appear
[03:43:50.440 --> 03:43:57.400]  worse than it was they said this as they personally sped up the footage to try and get it over as
[03:43:57.400 --> 03:44:03.160]  quickly as possible because this weird bobblehead thing that she was doing went on forever and as
[03:44:03.160 --> 03:44:08.440]  he said this ap journalist came out it was you know obviously pro clinton said oh there was nothing
[03:44:08.440 --> 03:44:15.640]  abnormal about this exchange whatsoever look at her face tell me that that's not abnormal absolutely
[03:44:15.640 --> 03:44:21.880]  bizarre but now we've got dr drew coming out today again they've tried to pin this on right-wing
[03:44:21.880 --> 03:44:28.520]  extremist conspiracy theorists we've got dr drew america's most trusted physician he said that he's
[03:44:28.520 --> 03:44:33.720]  analyzed the records that have already been released on hillary clinton and even what they've
[03:44:33.720 --> 03:44:41.400]  released is very suspicious because she's getting treatment straight out of the 1950s the 1960s
[03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:46.920]  he said that he's gravely concerned about it because the very side effects that we've seen
[03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:52.920]  in all this video footage and in these photos the weird seizures the dizziness the confusion
[03:44:53.480 --> 03:44:59.960]  their side effects of the medication that's inaccurately being prescribed to her by her doctors
[03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:06.040]  so you know they can't they can no longer just dismiss this by claiming it's it's paul joseph
[03:45:06.040 --> 03:45:11.160]  was and mike sernovich when we've got more and more prominent voices coming out and i guess
[03:45:11.160 --> 03:45:17.400]  you've also been contacted mike by health experts by neurologists like i have who are saying the
[03:45:17.400 --> 03:45:23.880]  same thing correct yes and i've also been contacted by secret service secret service agents as you
[03:45:23.880 --> 03:45:29.480]  have and i've heard similar things that it is an open secret among the secret service agents that
[03:45:29.480 --> 03:45:35.000]  hillary could could fall down anytime and that's why if you look at the other picture of hillary
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:40.280]  being held up by a secret service agent there's another one depicted where he's sort of leaning over
[03:45:40.280 --> 03:45:46.360]  over they've actually been trained and undergone drills about hillary's health now because they
[03:45:46.360 --> 03:45:51.480]  know that she could fall down or collapse at any time and that was the the interesting thing was
[03:45:51.480 --> 03:45:55.880]  i didn't know that you were on the track yeah i see exactly and you can see that the one guy's
[03:45:55.880 --> 03:46:00.280]  holding her up and the other guy has his hands outreached it also appears in his left hand he
[03:46:00.280 --> 03:46:06.920]  might be holding something i don't know if he has some kind of pen um the tan jacket in his left
[03:46:06.920 --> 03:46:12.440]  hand or which would be on the far far right of us he might even be holding something right there
[03:46:12.440 --> 03:46:18.200]  in his hand we can't tell though for sure and it looks like Mike on the other photos of this you
[03:46:18.200 --> 03:46:23.560]  see because people look at this and they say oh she must be on a tiny platform that's rickety and
[03:46:23.560 --> 03:46:29.640]  small you see the zoomed out photos and it's this huge wide platform it's not even very tall
[03:46:29.640 --> 03:46:36.520]  she wouldn't fall off it if she was had adequate balance right right that's how bad her balance is
[03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:41.240]  and again that's why she could fall at any time that's why that stool is with her all the time now
[03:46:41.880 --> 03:46:48.520]  because well it isn't now because of us thankfully she knows anytime she can lean up against it and
[03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:53.560]  we got it we got her like it's check made it her health is a major issue
[03:46:54.280 --> 03:46:59.080]  she could collapse at any moment the media has always known it and they've covered it up but
[03:46:59.080 --> 03:47:04.920]  they can't cover it up anymore and you've got these three presidential debates coming up next
[03:47:04.920 --> 03:47:10.920]  month with Trump again is she going to have this stool on standby she's going to be have to be
[03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:15.960]  walking around this is the whole point of the debate you have to project you have to case your
[03:47:15.960 --> 03:47:22.040]  territory it's it's like a dominant turf war kind of thing merely with your you know your body
[03:47:22.040 --> 03:47:25.960]  language in these debates she's going to be up there for a couple of hours a time with Trump at
[03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:32.680]  least facing all these questions which we know stresses her out do you foresee some kind of
[03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:38.440]  weird seizure or collapse in these high pressure situations that are coming up for Hillary Clinton
[03:47:39.720 --> 03:47:44.680]  it was initially leaked to me by her own people that Hillary was going to push to have the debates
[03:47:44.680 --> 03:47:50.840]  sitting down actually so we we expose that right away Hillary doesn't want to do the standing debate
[03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:56.440]  so what I predict is that she is going to put up a bunch of barriers to try to make debates not even
[03:47:56.440 --> 03:48:01.720]  happen because she wants them sitting down as you said she can't stand up for two hours she
[03:48:01.720 --> 03:48:07.640]  doesn't have the health to stand up for two hours she wants to have the debate sitting so what I
[03:48:07.640 --> 03:48:13.640]  predict will happen is there's going to be a push to have the debate sitting and if Trump won't do
[03:48:13.640 --> 03:48:18.200]  him sitting which he absolutely should not do then she's going to try to find a way to wheeze a lot
[03:48:18.200 --> 03:48:25.000]  of the debates amazing now just in the final couple of minutes my tell people how they can

[03:49:31.640 --> 03:49:37.720]  health scandal again drudge report had the headline up earlier today she's basically propped up by
[03:49:37.720 --> 03:49:44.920]  pillows at every speech she gives we had a video yesterday where she visited I think it was Jordan's
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:51.400]  childhood home she literally needs a zimmer frame at this point I mean not to be rude about it but
[03:49:51.400 --> 03:49:58.600]  she looks like an 85 year old granny who has problems getting from A to B if A to B are 10 yards
[03:49:58.600 --> 03:50:05.560]  apart which is exactly what the secret service agents have said privately what the NYPD officers
[03:50:05.560 --> 03:50:11.640]  officers have said who work security at her events she gives a 15 minute speech she's literally
[03:50:11.640 --> 03:50:18.200]  collapsing they have to help her back into the vehicle this is obviously a major problem given
[03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:24.920]  that she's about to take on if she wins the most stressful job in the world and if it was all an
[03:50:24.920 --> 03:50:30.200]  open book and that these problems were known and we could discuss them and debate them then fair
[03:50:30.200 --> 03:50:36.040]  enough but it's the cover-up they said oh her physician said a year ago she was fine and
[03:50:36.040 --> 03:50:41.720]  we're supposed to swallow that and accept it and not question it every single leftist mainstream
[03:50:41.720 --> 03:50:49.000]  media outlet from CNN to the Washington Post to MSNBC has been in full lockstep cover-up mode
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  trying to dismiss these questions as conspiracy theories even as more and more prominent voices

[03:56:01.160 --> 03:56:06.520]  hillary nypd officers who have been around hillary but where the conspiracy theorists
[03:56:06.520 --> 03:56:10.760]  for saying that there's something seriously wrong with hillary's health and they've been forced to
[03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:16.840]  address it this is up on info wars.com clinton campaign trump is parroting lies and deranged
[03:56:16.840 --> 03:56:21.880]  conspiracy theories about hillary's health so they came out and said that it was deranged there was
[03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:28.200]  no evidence for it and now trump's glommed onto it and he's just parroting conspiracy theorists
[03:56:28.200 --> 03:56:34.680]  conspiracy theorists like top neurologists america's most trusted physician again secret service
[03:56:34.680 --> 03:56:40.840]  agent whistleblowers who are saying all saying the same thing as each other they're all conspiracy
[03:56:40.840 --> 03:56:48.440]  theorists don't listen to them as hillary stumbles around holds on to railings leans against a stool
[03:56:48.440 --> 03:56:55.000]  is propped up by pillows has coughing fits as weird seizures it's all conspiracy theory don't
[03:56:55.000 --> 03:57:00.040]  talk about it you're a misogynist you're a sexist hillary has a vagina that's why she should be
[03:57:00.040 --> 03:57:06.520]  elected president of the united states that's all they've got at this point let's hear some final
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:12.520]  news stories malmo enjoys its eighth night in a row of cultural enrichment they've had eight nights
[03:57:12.520 --> 03:57:19.640]  in a row of cars being set ablaze in sweden sweden's third largest city again they're all in the
[03:57:19.640 --> 03:57:26.680]  no-go muslim ghetto areas which the left says don't exist as the police as the firefighters
[03:57:26.680 --> 03:57:32.920]  as the ambulance workers are afraid to even go there as the taxi drivers are afraid to even
[03:57:32.920 --> 03:57:38.440]  take you there as we're chased out of them by actual islamists like you saw in mollambique
[03:57:38.440 --> 03:57:46.920]  brussels but again they don't exist as cars are set ablaze for an eighth night in a row in malmo
[03:57:46.920 --> 03:57:52.040]  none of it exists it's a conspiracy theory norwegian police chief says xenophobia is highly
[03:57:52.040 --> 03:57:59.720]  rational and justified cites crime stats again those annoying racist facts are getting in the
[03:57:59.720 --> 03:58:05.080]  way of the left narrative again they blamed all these rapes that were taking place in norway
[03:58:05.080 --> 03:58:11.080]  on norwegian drinking culture again nothing to do with the fact that they've imported thousands
[03:58:11.080 --> 03:58:15.800]  of migrants who have no respect for women who literally have a game called taha rush which is
[03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:21.400]  about raping women but again none of that exists it's the conspiracy theory left campaigns to
[03:58:21.400 --> 03:58:27.640]  shut down migrant skeptic newspapers here in the uk they're actually trying to make advertisers
[03:58:27.640 --> 03:58:32.120]  boycott newspapers that report the truth about migrant crimes to try and get them shut down
[03:58:32.120 --> 03:58:37.080]  while leftists in germany who work in refugee camps are actually being raped by migrants
[03:58:37.080 --> 03:58:41.400]  that's going to wrap it up for the alex john show we'll be back tomorrow breaking news at info
