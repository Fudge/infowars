[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:20.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:32.240]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Wednesday July 29th I have to think about
[00:32.240 --> 00:36.320]  this this month is moving so quickly we only got a couple of days left in July
[00:36.320 --> 00:40.160]  today we're going to be joined by Steve Quayle in the third hour we're going to
[00:40.160 --> 00:43.400]  have an interview with him we're also going to have some special reports from
[00:43.400 --> 00:50.000]  Paul Joseph Watson a lot of news today there is a successful move beginning in
[00:50.000 --> 00:57.080]  California to recall Senator Pan the doctor who took away informed consent
[00:57.080 --> 01:00.440]  with his bill and bragged about the fact that he wasn't going to stop there
[01:00.440 --> 01:04.400]  in California and he was going to take that across the United States we're
[01:04.400 --> 01:07.480]  going to talk about that in detail because you know what that affects
[01:07.480 --> 01:12.920]  everyone this is a movement that began all at once just as we talk about
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.880]  Agenda 21 just as we see with the UN War on Drugs that was a group of
[01:18.880 --> 01:24.880]  schedules it was created by the UN just like Agenda 21 they created the War on
[01:24.880 --> 01:29.320]  Drugs gave it four schedules and ten years later Richard Nixon got it
[01:29.320 --> 01:33.160]  enacted verbatim we talked about that before about the American Legislative
[01:33.160 --> 01:39.680]  Exchange Council where they write local state laws and get them pass this form
[01:39.680 --> 01:44.120]  over to the state legislators all they have to do is fill in the blanks as to
[01:44.120 --> 01:47.260]  which state it is make sure that it gets passed and they get some nice little
[01:47.260 --> 01:53.160]  gifts like that same thing happening with vaccines this is a time for people
[01:53.160 --> 01:57.960]  to stand up and get angry and to pay attention to the people who are selling
[01:57.960 --> 02:01.360]  out our freedom who are selling us down the river who are destroying this
[02:01.360 --> 02:04.560]  country economically here's an article up on info wars.com here's the
[02:04.560 --> 02:11.800]  politicians who were paid to make GMO labeling illegal despite 90% of the
[02:11.800 --> 02:16.080]  people wanting this labeling and again when they talk about it being the safe
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.800]  and accurate labeling act prohibiting states and localities from saying we
[02:21.800 --> 02:27.920]  want to know if genetically modified food is in this process product why
[02:27.920 --> 02:31.680]  wouldn't we want to know that this is an open-ended question this is something
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.560]  genetic modification of everything of our food of our animals is progressing at
[02:37.560 --> 02:42.680]  a very very rapid rate we talked about that yesterday why would we not want to
[02:42.680 --> 02:46.760]  know if that sort of thing is in our food and again there's a lot of different
[02:46.760 --> 02:50.440]  ways that that's been fought they've spent millions tens of millions of
[02:50.440 --> 02:55.200]  dollars and referenda at the state levels they've typically lost when it's
[02:55.200 --> 02:58.280]  been done at the local level does that tell you something does that tell you
[02:58.280 --> 03:01.960]  that you can get change done at the local level that you can't get done at
[03:01.960 --> 03:07.320]  the federal level at the state level and of course that's why they move this to
[03:07.320 --> 03:12.120]  the national level they can get it done in America because Monsanto owns a lot
[03:12.120 --> 03:15.960]  of legislators in the United States they don't own that many people in other
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.000]  countries so that's why we've got things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership the
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.320]  trans the TTIP the transatlantic partnership they're going to make sure
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.960]  that in countries where they have put restrictions but labeling on GMO made
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.880]  some of these additives illegal they're going to make sure that that is removed
[03:32.880 --> 03:35.880]  that's one of the reasons that they're putting this in it's not about free trade
[03:35.880 --> 03:42.680]  it is about controlled crony capitalism that's why they won't show you the
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.040]  legislation some other news coming out of course yesterday the Chinese stock
[03:46.040 --> 03:51.320]  markets plummeted again another huge drop and this happened not that long ago
[03:51.320 --> 03:56.840]  remember we had a massive drop on a Monday now this has happened again markets
[03:56.840 --> 04:00.200]  are very shaky and the question is when you see that and we said that at the
[04:00.200 --> 04:03.760]  time yes they recovered with a great deal of government intervention is it a
[04:03.760 --> 04:07.480]  dead cat bounce when that happens perhaps it is so we're going to be talking
[04:07.480 --> 04:13.120]  about economic news today the Fed is going to be having their pontification
[04:13.120 --> 04:15.600]  meeting everybody's going to be watching Janet Yellen to see if there's white
[04:15.600 --> 04:21.920]  smoke coming out of the the meeting to see if rates are going to be rising so
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.480]  we'll take a look at that we're also going to take a look at a very special
[04:26.480 --> 04:32.640]  piece of crony capitalism just for the bankers you won't believe this one I
[04:32.640 --> 04:36.320]  didn't know about this myself it's been there since the creation of the Federal
[04:36.320 --> 04:42.520]  Reserve the incredible piece of set aside talk about crony capitalism talk
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.120]  about corporate welfare of course that's what happens they get away with that
[04:46.120 --> 04:49.880]  while Greece goes down the tubes and the rest of us as well stay with us we'll
[04:49.880 --> 04:52.280]  be right back

[08:29.440 --> 08:33.600]  gonna be joining us later in the show in the third hour we also have special
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.560]  reports from Paul Joseph Watson we're gonna be looking in detail at crony
[08:38.560 --> 08:43.600]  capitalism a special piece of crony capitalism that I was never aware of a
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.800]  special little dividend that they've been giving banks for a hundred years
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.040]  also today are we're going to see whether or not Janet Yellen is going to
[08:53.040 --> 08:57.520]  decide to raise the interest rates we all wait with baited breath to see how
[08:57.520 --> 09:02.040]  they're going to manipulate the economy they're doing such a good job of that but
[09:02.040 --> 09:06.520]  before we start all of that I want to take a look at the media frenzy around
[09:06.520 --> 09:12.640]  Cecil the black-maned lion there are a raft of reports and of course Drudge
[09:12.640 --> 09:17.800]  always has his thumb on the zeitgeist of the media you can see a ton of these
[09:17.800 --> 09:21.240]  reports up at the link at the top of the drudge report here's some of the
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.640]  headlines Jimmy Kimmel chokes up on air over Cecil the lion he likens the
[09:26.640 --> 09:30.880]  hunter who killed him to Bill Clauseby some bob way unofficial say an American
[09:30.880 --> 09:35.480]  man is wanted and the killing of Cecil the lion daily mail says the hunter
[09:35.480 --> 09:40.880]  hunted an American dentist who paid $55,000 to kill off Africa's most famous
[09:40.880 --> 09:44.800]  lion goes into hiding and says he did nothing wrong is in Bob way police
[09:44.800 --> 09:49.120]  demand to speak to him a coward and a killer they say protesters target his
[09:49.120 --> 09:53.200]  office the surgery office after he admits to doing this so we see these
[09:53.200 --> 09:58.920]  headlines everywhere I want to play you a little bit of a clip that was on CNN
[09:58.920 --> 10:04.200]  let's play that first clip guys let's allege that Walter Palmer and his dentist
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.440]  from Minnesota was in Zimbabwe on the border regions of this park and that
[10:09.440 --> 10:15.000]  him and the guys lured or baited this line this iconic line Cecil from
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.760]  quantity National Park out of the park so you hear that they lured or baited him
[10:21.760 --> 10:26.520]  does that sound familiar just had Abby Hoffman on yesterday talking about the
[10:26.520 --> 10:31.680]  practices and Planned Parenthood where she was a manager an employee of the year
[10:31.680 --> 10:37.320]  before she resigned she was concerned that people were being lured and baited
[10:37.320 --> 10:40.760]  women were being lured and baited in there and the promise of family planning
[10:40.760 --> 10:48.280]  but they were given quotas quotas to sell abortions that's a different kind of
[10:48.280 --> 10:52.480]  bait and switch isn't it but we can't get that upset about human babies we can
[10:52.480 --> 10:56.440]  save the baby whales but we can't save the baby humans and there's this massive
[10:56.440 --> 11:02.400]  media frenzy about Cecil the lion one more clip let's play that next clip he
[11:02.400 --> 11:07.040]  shot him with a crossbow but that crossbow didn't kill the lion outright
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.800]  they tracked according to conservation officials that line for 40 hours and
[11:11.800 --> 11:17.800]  then killed it with a weapon of some kind and then they severed the head as a
[11:17.800 --> 11:23.160]  trophy there you go concern about and rifle concern I was I'm not I'm the
[11:23.160 --> 11:26.400]  trashing the fact that people are concerned that this is perhaps done
[11:26.400 --> 11:30.840]  illegally that the animals suffered a great deal of time I don't have the
[11:30.840 --> 11:33.600]  problem with hunting that a lot of people do I think that's a perfectly
[11:33.600 --> 11:36.920]  legitimate thing but of course a lot of people want to stop all hunting
[11:36.920 --> 11:40.880]  nevertheless understand that they say well he shot him it took a very long
[11:40.880 --> 11:46.160]  time for him to die so he's suffering that's what that's what Abby Johnson
[11:46.160 --> 11:51.200]  said yesterday first of all there were two things the quotas that disturbed her
[11:51.200 --> 11:56.360]  and then the final thing that caused her to resign immediately was when she saw
[11:56.360 --> 12:02.560]  an ultrasound of a fetus recoiling in pain from the procedure the babies are
[12:02.560 --> 12:07.480]  ripped apart and we don't have any concern about that but we're concerned
[12:07.480 --> 12:13.120]  that it took extra time for this lion to die and then they took his head as a
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.800]  trophy what is Planned Parenthood doing with the babies that they kill that's
[12:18.800 --> 12:23.080]  precisely the point in these videos that we see over and over again here's an
[12:23.080 --> 12:28.080]  article from info wars.com Planned Parenthood demands that the media not
[12:28.080 --> 12:31.560]  air damning footage this came out yesterday from Don Salazar here at
[12:31.560 --> 12:35.280]  info wars.com the material they say should not be aired they're telling
[12:35.280 --> 12:42.880]  local news outlets let me read to you a long interview that's on salon with
[12:42.880 --> 12:47.600]  Camille Pagley and again yesterday she had some very good candid remarks that
[12:47.600 --> 12:50.840]  she's a straight shooter I don't just I don't agree with her on a lot of things
[12:50.840 --> 12:55.920]  but she is very straight up with what she has to say we read her comment
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.600]  yesterday about Hillary Clinton this is what she says about the media course
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.320]  she's talking about how control the media wise she said the rise of Rush
[13:03.320 --> 13:07.400]  Limbaugh and conservative talk radio came about precisely because of the
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.920]  lockdown of a very small click of people on the media that had a liberal
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.280]  bias but she said she was a liberal and she couldn't get access in that media
[13:16.280 --> 13:20.840]  they completely shut her out and she said let me give you a recent example of
[13:20.840 --> 13:26.280]  the persistent insularity of the liberal thought in the media she said when the
[13:26.280 --> 13:29.760]  first secret Planned Parenthood video was released in mid-July anyone who
[13:29.760 --> 13:34.160]  looks only at liberal media was kept totally in the dark about it even the
[13:34.160 --> 13:37.920]  second video when it was released same thing happened but the videos were being
[13:37.920 --> 13:42.960]  run non-stop all over conservative talk radio shows and on television it was a
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.360]  huge and disturbing story but there was total silence in the liberal media yes
[13:47.360 --> 13:51.600]  what they are demanding today from local media outlets trying to intimidate them
[13:51.600 --> 13:56.920]  this is she says this is Camille Pagli again a liberal feminist she said that
[13:56.920 --> 14:01.400]  kind of censorship was shockingly unprofessional the liberal major media
[14:01.400 --> 14:04.680]  were trying to bury the story by ignoring it now they're demanding that
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.800]  people ignore and I'll add going back to her she says I am a former member of
[14:09.800 --> 14:14.200]  Planned Parenthood and a strong supporter of unconstrained reproductive
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.920]  rights but I was horrified and disgusted by those videos and immediately felt
[14:18.920 --> 14:23.120]  there were serious breaches of medical ethics in the conduct of Planned
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.000]  Parenthood officials here's my point it is everyone's obligation whatever your
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  political views to look at both liberal and conservative news sources every
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.160]  single day you need a full range of viewpoints to understand what's going on
[14:37.160 --> 14:43.080]  in this world absolutely right again she is strongly supporting abortion she
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.400]  sees it as reproductive rights I strongly disagree I see it as killing
[14:48.400 --> 14:56.440]  innocent human life but we both agree that you need to look at a broad spectrum
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.240]  of media form your own opinions go to people who will honestly tell you what
[15:01.240 --> 15:06.400]  they think look this whole nonsense about journalism being disinterested and
[15:06.400 --> 15:10.640]  being honest anybody that is selling you that is selling you a lie either
[15:10.640 --> 15:16.160]  they're stupid enough that they don't recognize their own biases or they're
[15:16.160 --> 15:21.120]  being dishonest with you about their own biases okay even what they report
[15:21.120 --> 15:24.920]  which is what she's talking about here even what they choose to report is
[15:24.920 --> 15:30.160]  influenced by their own personal opinions so there is no objective media
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.400]  there is media out there that will tell you what they think we're part of that
[15:34.400 --> 15:38.160]  media we will tell you what we think you may disagree with us we'll make our best
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.360]  case for it but we're not going to tell you that we're sitting here disinterested
[15:42.360 --> 15:45.320]  sitting in the middle well on this hand we have this and on this hand we have
[15:45.320 --> 15:48.200]  that yeah we'll give you both sides but no one will form an opinion tell you what
[15:48.200 --> 15:53.320]  we think help you to form your opinion there is no disinterested media
[15:53.320 --> 15:59.360]  anybody that tells you that is an idiot or they're lying now in terms of the
[15:59.360 --> 16:02.920]  other things that came out that interview yesterday with Abby Johnson and
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.960]  again her website is abortionworker.com we had an article that went up
[16:07.960 --> 16:11.760]  yesterday evening highlighting one of the things that she told us which I was
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.600]  absolutely amazed to find out that Planned Parenthood here in Austin has a
[16:15.600 --> 16:22.960]  $1 a year lease on a 7,000 square foot facility that they're performing their
[16:22.960 --> 16:28.640]  abortions at they have a $1 a year lease from our city our city of Austin is
[16:28.640 --> 16:35.320]  subsidizing that facility they have a 20 year lease $1 a year and so we put
[16:35.320 --> 16:39.200]  that article up because you may not be aware that that is happening in your
[16:39.200 --> 16:45.320]  area here's an article from WND women are betrayed their protests in 65 US
[16:45.320 --> 16:49.200]  cities across the United States an estimated 12,000 Americans and as many
[16:49.200 --> 16:55.680]  as 65 US cities took to the streets on Tuesday to demand an end to federal
[16:55.680 --> 17:02.360]  funding of Planned Parenthood do not make me pay for this I find the practice
[17:02.360 --> 17:08.520]  abhorrent it is a violation of my religious beliefs do not force me to
[17:08.520 --> 17:11.840]  pay for this something this controversial if it is even going to
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.720]  exist we can have this discussion should not be funded by the federal
[17:16.720 --> 17:20.720]  government it should not be funded by taxes and so these people are are
[17:20.720 --> 17:24.720]  demanding an end to federal funding of Planned Parenthood but maybe you don't
[17:24.720 --> 17:31.240]  understand that there's probably state and city and local subsidies of Planned
[17:31.240 --> 17:35.520]  Parenthood so you need to investigate that I was not aware of that here in
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.640]  Austin as well and again one more article that's up on info wars calm came
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.280]  out today a Senate moves to defund Planned Parenthood sponsors are
[17:44.280 --> 17:48.560]  scrambling to disassociate themselves from these abortionists they say the
[17:48.560 --> 17:54.400]  companies are now all they had this this list of direct subsidies from various
[17:54.400 --> 17:59.520]  corporations that was up on their site everybody is demanding to be taken off
[17:59.520 --> 18:02.800]  of that they don't want to be associated with that so I just say they won't still
[18:02.800 --> 18:08.080]  give them the money they'll find some way to do it and we have amazing list of
[18:08.080 --> 18:14.400]  companies and organizations companies like Freddie May Fannie mostly Freddie
[18:14.400 --> 18:21.400]  Mac Fannie Mae but nevertheless they are federal mortgage companies and they are
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.640]  contributing money and when they were called on it they said well we have a
[18:24.640 --> 18:31.840]  matching a policy where we match our employees donations and so we can't not
[18:31.840 --> 18:38.920]  do that yes you can the policies you make the policies you can change the
[18:38.920 --> 18:45.880]  policies but we have a federal agency that is out there to help to provide
[18:45.880 --> 18:49.400]  affordable housing affordable mortgages that's their stated purpose of course
[18:49.400 --> 18:56.240]  they were very deep in all of this fraud that was perpetrated on everyone with
[18:56.240 --> 19:00.920]  their home mortgages they were getting massive bonuses the heads of these
[19:00.920 --> 19:06.400]  these federal organizations massive bonuses for making junk loans so don't
[19:06.400 --> 19:11.640]  be surprised that a federal mortgage corporation is also contributing to
[19:11.640 --> 19:19.520]  plan parenthood if you might remember there was some time ago that crowd hammer
[19:19.520 --> 19:23.640]  on Fox News they were talking about drones being ubiquitous everywhere he
[19:23.640 --> 19:27.560]  said the first guy to shoot down a drone is going to be a national hero well we
[19:27.560 --> 19:32.640]  now have that man's name okay and we're gonna give that man's name to you when
[19:32.640 --> 19:37.200]  we come back this is a very interesting story course he was arrested he was
[19:37.200 --> 19:41.800]  arrested and maybe we all need to get behind him and stand behind him for what
[19:41.800 --> 19:46.040]  he did it wasn't even a government drone that he shot down this is a very
[19:46.040 --> 19:51.840]  creepy drone prowling around taking video at close range of him and his
[19:51.840 --> 19:59.280]  neighbors houses and he shot it down stay with us we'll be right back in

[25:22.400 --> 25:27.240]  other products like deep cleanse they run out very very quickly now going to
[25:27.240 --> 25:30.240]  this report that we had yesterday from Paul Joseph Watson we talked to him he
[25:30.240 --> 25:33.960]  was in the city of London and he was telling us about some questionable
[25:33.960 --> 25:39.360]  banking practices there but this is a little bit different this is about the
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.280]  thought police coming after people who want to protest Muslims let's go to that
[25:44.280 --> 26:08.080]  report
[26:08.080 --> 26:13.400]  this is Paul Joseph Watson reporting for infowars.com amazing shocking
[26:13.400 --> 26:19.240]  story up on infowars.com today which centers around this right-wing leader
[26:19.240 --> 26:23.680]  took called Tommy Robinson he's quite controversial in this country he was
[26:23.680 --> 26:29.120]  arrested re-arrested recently for planning to attend a draw Mohammed
[26:29.120 --> 26:34.680]  cartoon contest now to understand the backstory he was arrested separately for
[26:34.680 --> 26:40.360]  mortgage fraud last year but he was already released by police in June they
[26:40.360 --> 26:45.880]  re-arrested him literally days before this event was due to take place last
[26:45.880 --> 26:51.520]  week because of the fear that he might offend Muslims now this is coming out of
[26:51.520 --> 26:56.840]  a left-wing group called hope not hate which said that these right-wing
[26:56.840 --> 27:01.240]  individuals were planning to disseminate Mohammed cartoons in Muslim areas to
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.800]  start quote a civil war that was completely unfounded but Robinson
[27:05.800 --> 27:10.640]  himself has confirmed that he was re-arrested by police just for planning
[27:10.640 --> 27:16.480]  to attend this draw Mohammed cartoon event here in the United Kingdom his
[27:16.480 --> 27:21.600]  speech in Oxford last year was also cancelled because again he was arrested
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.960]  by police so we literally have four criminals being kidnapped on the
[27:26.960 --> 27:31.800]  streets of London for daring to even think about committing the thought crime
[27:31.800 --> 27:36.840]  of offending Muslims of course you think back to Charlie Hebdo back in
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.760]  January just we Charlie and that whole stand for free speech that has also
[27:41.760 --> 27:46.320]  completely evaporated in light of Charlie Hebdo now backing down and saying
[27:46.320 --> 27:50.160]  they will stop drawing Mohammed cartoons now contrast this to an incident
[27:50.160 --> 27:53.600]  which occurred right here in London in this very area just a few weeks ago
[27:53.600 --> 27:59.880]  where a Muslim individual was walking around waving an ISIS flag he was
[27:59.880 --> 28:05.240]  briefly detained by police not taken in for questioning not arrested for
[28:05.240 --> 28:11.200]  carrying an ISIS flag on the streets of London meanwhile British nationals who
[28:11.200 --> 28:16.680]  merely dare to plan to attend a draw Mohammed cartoon event of being kidnapped
[28:16.680 --> 28:21.720]  off the streets simply for their free speech we also had another incident here
[28:21.720 --> 28:26.240]  in the United Kingdom about a year ago where a political leader of the Liberty
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.760]  Party called Paul Western was arrested again on the street for daring to read
[28:31.760 --> 28:36.880]  out a Winston Churchill quote about immigration because it could cause
[28:36.880 --> 28:41.640]  offends to immigrants so we literally have thought criminals political
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.920]  dissidents being arrested on the streets of London because they might offend
[28:46.920 --> 28:52.720]  Muslims that's the shocking state of free speech here in London in the United
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.280]  Kingdom I'm gonna have more updates on that story on info wars.com this is
[28:57.280 --> 29:03.200]  Paul Joseph Watson reporting live from London for info wars.com exactly and
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.240]  Alex Jones is in Europe investigating the globalist takeover there he's
[29:07.240 --> 29:12.200]  traveling to various countries he's going to be filing reports with us as I
[29:12.200 --> 29:17.720]  mentioned before the break we now have the man who is the first hero to shoot
[29:17.720 --> 29:23.440]  down a drone his name is William Meredith he's from Louisville, Kentucky 47
[29:23.440 --> 29:27.720]  year old this is a drone that was $1800 we're gonna have more information about
[29:27.720 --> 29:32.720]  that specific incident I think it's it tells us a lot and also a reminder that
[29:32.720 --> 29:38.320]  Dr. Pan has now come up for a recall election we're going to talk about that
[29:38.320 --> 29:42.520]  and another piece of vaccine news when we come back stay with us we'll be right
[29:42.520 --> 29:54.480]  back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[30:13.560 --> 30:17.960]  gruesome videos exposing the organization's involvement in fetal
[30:17.960 --> 30:23.320]  organ harvesting continue to emerge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has
[30:23.320 --> 30:29.160]  appointed a group to craft a measure to deal with the horrendous videos the group
[30:29.160 --> 30:32.920]  which includes Senator Rand Paul and James Langford who have already
[30:32.920 --> 30:38.040]  introduced legislation to defund the nonprofit organization well they met
[30:38.040 --> 30:42.520]  yesterday afternoon to discuss the way forward responding to the announcement
[30:42.520 --> 30:47.640]  over the upcoming defunding vote Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid responded
[30:47.640 --> 30:52.120]  bluntly good luck with that Hillary Clinton has received donations from

[33:34.160 --> 33:38.160]  circumstances of the first person to do that a man from Louisville Kentucky
[33:38.160 --> 33:43.760]  47-year-old William Meredith he said sunday afternoon he was out in the yard
[33:43.760 --> 33:47.680]  with his kids his girls came in from the back deck and they said daddy there's a
[33:47.680 --> 33:52.280]  drone outside he went out to look at it he waved at it it flew away then later
[33:52.280 --> 33:56.600]  it comes back and he says he's got a 16 year old daughter who likes to sign out
[33:56.600 --> 34:01.320]  by the pool he thought it was kind of creepy yeah I think so too he noticed
[34:01.320 --> 34:05.360]  he said you should have privacy in your own backyard absolutely he noticed that
[34:05.360 --> 34:08.600]  it was down at the neighbor's house about 10 feet off the ground he said
[34:08.600 --> 34:12.480]  looking under the canopy that they've got under their backyard so it's very low
[34:12.480 --> 34:17.480]  it's looking under a canopy I went over I got my shotgun I said I'm not gonna do
[34:17.480 --> 34:21.880]  anything unless it's directly over my property within a minute or so it came
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.200]  over his property he said it was hovering over the top of my property and I
[34:25.200 --> 34:28.760]  shot it out of the sky I didn't shoot across the road I didn't shoot across my
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.560]  neighbor's fences I shot directly into the air shooting it down he said not too
[34:33.560 --> 34:37.600]  long some of these guys show up and they say are you the SOB that shut down my
[34:37.600 --> 34:41.640]  drone he said yeah I am and he had his 40 millimeter Glock on him he said and
[34:41.640 --> 34:44.960]  they started toward me I told him if you cross my sidewalk there's gonna be
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.360]  another shooting so a short time after that the police arrived he said he was
[34:50.360 --> 34:53.720]  disappointed however with the police response they didn't have a problem with
[34:53.720 --> 34:58.000]  a peeping Tom drone they had a problem with the fact that he shot it down when
[34:58.000 --> 35:03.560]  it was coming down low over his property trespassing he said they didn't
[35:03.560 --> 35:07.640]  confiscate the drone they gave the drone back to the individuals they didn't
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.040]  even take the SIM card out of it he said but we've got five houses here in the
[35:12.040 --> 35:14.600]  neighborhood everyone saw it they saw what happened including the neighbors
[35:14.600 --> 35:19.400]  that were sitting in their patio when he flew down low enough to see under their
[35:19.400 --> 35:24.800]  patio that's the kind of constant surveillance that we get from the
[35:24.800 --> 35:29.160]  government however people don't realize they get upset when they see this they
[35:29.160 --> 35:32.600]  get upset when a comedian comes around you remember that report that we've
[35:32.600 --> 35:38.840]  showed many times on Info Wars where he puts on a suit and sunglasses dresses
[35:38.840 --> 35:43.160]  up like a secret service agent gets a microphone and puts it on a big boom and
[35:43.160 --> 35:46.760]  he goes around in public places where people are talking at benches talking
[35:46.760 --> 35:52.040]  at tables and he puts the microphone boom right over them and he's got a cord
[35:52.040 --> 35:54.720]  coming back they know that he's recording it and they they stop what
[35:54.720 --> 35:57.980]  they're doing and they turn around it's like go away this is creepy or they
[35:57.980 --> 36:01.640]  chase him or whatever that's a normal response it's a normal response to do
[36:01.640 --> 36:07.160]  that when you see a drone snooping on you do you understand that the government
[36:07.160 --> 36:11.360]  is doing that in a far worse way corporations are doing that in a far
[36:11.360 --> 36:16.080]  more invasive way than that you just don't see it I think that's a lot of
[36:16.080 --> 36:21.360]  what we see in terms of the discrepancy between the concern but that's
[36:21.360 --> 36:26.120]  there's the video right there what what is his name again guys
[36:26.120 --> 36:30.480]  Tom May we've even interviewed him and I always have to ask his name but it's
[36:30.480 --> 36:34.160]  really funny he's got a lot of very funny videos I've seen I just have
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.080]  difficult time recalling his name there you can see him going in public holding
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.360]  the microphone putting it into people's faces intruding into their private life
[36:42.360 --> 36:46.960]  that's the whole idea why aren't we concerned about government intrusions
[36:46.960 --> 36:51.880]  into our private life when they are specifically prohibited from doing that
[36:51.880 --> 36:58.000]  that's why we had the FISA act they made it clear after they saw the
[36:58.000 --> 37:03.240]  encroachments and how the CIA and the NSA were getting out of bounds here
[37:03.240 --> 37:07.600]  domestically especially but even abroad they wanted to reign that in so they
[37:07.600 --> 37:10.800]  created the foreign intelligence surveillance act so you will only be
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.760]  allowed to do foreign intelligence surveillance nevertheless we see that
[37:15.760 --> 37:21.520]  the FISA court has now become a rubber stamp to allow them to do massive
[37:21.520 --> 37:26.360]  surveillance here domestically that's the way they invert everything the USA
[37:26.360 --> 37:32.800]  Freedom Act was set up not to assert our freedom but to assert the freedom of the
[37:32.800 --> 37:37.720]  government to intrude on our liberties on our privacy to extend this kind of
[37:37.720 --> 37:41.680]  dragnet surveillance just like the Patriot Act just like the safe and
[37:41.680 --> 37:47.920]  accurate food labeling act prohibits safe and accurate food labeling everything
[37:47.920 --> 37:53.400]  they do is a cynical lie anymore let's talk a little bit about the
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.680]  presidential politics while we're on cynical lies we got Rand Paul calling
[37:58.680 --> 38:02.480]  for Hillary Clinton to return donations from Planned Parenthood officials he
[38:02.480 --> 38:06.520]  says Hillary Clinton's hands are stained by accepting this money she needs to
[38:06.520 --> 38:11.000]  immediately return every red cent she has received from Planned Parenthood
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.360]  employees and he pointed out that Washington Free Beacon did research and
[38:16.360 --> 38:20.000]  found that she had collected Hillary Clinton had collected at more than
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.680]  $10,000 from at least nine different Planned Parenthood employees just since
[38:25.680 --> 38:30.280]  she launched this presidential election campaign compare that to what
[38:30.280 --> 38:36.680]  happened to Dinesh D'Souza critic of Obama who because he gave four donations
[38:36.680 --> 38:43.800]  of $20,000 in different people's names $5,000 was a limit at that time he got
[38:43.800 --> 38:49.160]  charged with a felony he's being pushed around by a judge who says he needs to
[38:49.160 --> 38:55.200]  be evaluated for mental illness but of course Planned Parenthood can give $10,000
[38:55.200 --> 38:59.880]  from nine different people to Hillary Clinton and that's what's happening a lot
[38:59.880 --> 39:04.040]  of people are having enough of this you can see at info wars.com you can see a
[39:04.040 --> 39:08.280]  list of the politicians who supported the illegal labeling law that's one of
[39:08.280 --> 39:13.640]  the articles we have up there despite 90% of the people wanting labeling we also
[39:13.640 --> 39:20.240]  have a Republican politician who's had enough of John Boehner I've had enough
[39:20.240 --> 39:24.880]  of John Boehner I would certainly support this move to oust him as Speaker
[39:24.880 --> 39:29.920]  of the House this is a North Carolina representative Mark Meadows he has now put
[39:29.920 --> 39:35.440]  out a motion for Boehner to vacate the chair an extraordinarily rare procedural
[39:35.440 --> 39:40.000]  move that represents the most serious expression of opposition to Boehner's
[39:40.000 --> 39:45.120]  speakership they say now Meadows is a second term Republican and they report
[39:45.120 --> 39:50.040]  it's amazing that this is Politico of course kind of taking the mainstream
[39:50.040 --> 39:53.840]  position on this they're always going to support the leadership of the two
[39:53.840 --> 40:00.640]  parties they say this is ill-advised many of his even the critics of John
[40:00.640 --> 40:06.160]  Boehner and even Meadows friends think this is ill-advised move it's
[40:06.160 --> 40:12.360]  preemptive he didn't even meet privately with Boehner it's like why we don't need
[40:12.360 --> 40:16.080]  to meet with Boehner we know what he's doing we know that he's betrayed the
[40:16.080 --> 40:20.480]  voters we know that he can't get upset about these Planned Parenthood videos
[40:20.480 --> 40:25.760]  he can only get upset about his golf games he can cry when he talks about his
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.320]  golf games but he could care less about what's going on with Planned Parenthood
[40:30.320 --> 40:35.920]  it's absolutely apparent to everyone you don't need to have yet another closed
[40:35.920 --> 40:42.440]  meeting with him but nevertheless going back to July 22nd a little over a month
[40:42.440 --> 40:47.240]  ago there was another article from Politico talking about the way he was
[40:47.240 --> 40:52.520]  treating fellow Republicans in the House it goes beyond his position on the
[40:52.520 --> 40:57.000]  issues it goes beyond his betrayal of the Republican voters that should be
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.920]  enough that should be enough we don't need to have any more of that but he's
[40:59.920 --> 41:04.800]  making enemies amongst the conservatives in the House this article from a month
[41:04.800 --> 41:07.960]  ago says that representative Mark Meadows the same guy that just put up
[41:07.960 --> 41:12.640]  the resolution to get him out get Boehner out said Mark Meadows was punished
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.600]  for crossing the speaker conservatives consider blocking GOP legislation and
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.880]  trying to shake up the leadership at that time the group is irate at what it
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.800]  calls a culture of punishment that Boehner's leadership team has instituted
[41:25.800 --> 41:31.600]  against members who dissent and this isn't even really on a major issue this
[41:31.600 --> 41:38.680]  was because they did not support his procedural vote on something so because
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.520]  of that Mark Meadows was punished by being removed from a subcommittee
[41:43.520 --> 41:49.440]  chairmanship that's the way this goes now we've got Chris Christie one of the
[41:49.440 --> 41:55.560]  presidential hopefuls telling Colorado that the pot party is going to end with
[41:55.560 --> 41:59.760]  him if he gets elected so now we got the potbelly lecturing the potheds
[41:59.760 --> 42:05.840]  presumably and maybe his campaign slogan could be unhappy days are here again we
[42:05.840 --> 42:09.880]  could take FDR's song happy days are here again play it backwards maybe because
[42:09.880 --> 42:14.000]  we really are going back to the future with somebody like this doesn't he
[42:14.000 --> 42:19.360]  realize that there is no support for this in the public if this were genuinely
[42:19.360 --> 42:23.840]  an election you wouldn't make those kind of statements but there's a lot of
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.800]  powerful people powerful economic interests behind the war on drugs law
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.480]  enforcement the prison industry many many industries are behind this and this is
[42:33.480 --> 42:37.880]  what he says he says if you're getting high in Colorado in Colorado today enjoy
[42:37.880 --> 42:45.000]  it Christie says as of January 2017 I will enforce the federal law if you want
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.100]  to change the marijuana laws go ahead change the national marijuana laws well
[42:50.100 --> 42:56.640]  I would say to Christie if you want to enact failed policies of prohibition then
[42:56.640 --> 43:02.140]  why don't you amend the Constitution first like the 18th amendment and the
[43:02.140 --> 43:06.040]  21st amendment if I've got those numbers right I think those are the two we have
[43:06.040 --> 43:11.200]  two amendments out of only 20 some odd amendments that were there because the
[43:11.200 --> 43:16.480]  federal government has no constitutional authority to prohibit
[43:16.480 --> 43:22.760]  anything folks they needed a special amendment to have the power to prohibit
[43:22.760 --> 43:26.840]  alcohol so they had to pass a constitutional amendment because they
[43:26.840 --> 43:31.760]  still respected the Constitution to some extent in the early 20th century no
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.400]  longer they just make a pronouncement and say it's the law we don't care what
[43:35.400 --> 43:40.040]  the Constitution says there it is it was the 18th amendment they don't care
[43:40.040 --> 43:44.600]  what the Constitution says just obey the federal law he doesn't have to obey
[43:44.600 --> 43:49.560]  the Constitution even though he takes an oath to it the whole thing is a UN
[43:49.560 --> 43:53.640]  agenda and it's about time conservatives wake up to that it's about time we wake
[43:53.640 --> 43:57.360]  up to the fact that we're not going to change people's behavior we're not going
[43:57.360 --> 44:00.920]  to change their spiritual condition we're not going to change their medical
[44:00.920 --> 44:08.920]  condition by using the hammer and fist of SWAT teams all we're going to do is
[44:08.920 --> 44:12.080]  corrupt law enforcement as we've seen over and over again yesterday we had the
[44:12.080 --> 44:16.440]  story about a district attorney who is paying for his college loans by
[44:16.440 --> 44:19.960]  stealing property from people in the name of the war on drugs they don't
[44:19.960 --> 44:24.120]  even charge you with a crime let alone find you guilty of a crime this
[44:24.120 --> 44:29.640]  violates every fundamental principle of government and self-government and the
[44:29.640 --> 44:34.880]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights the war on drugs is illegal it needs to be
[44:34.880 --> 44:40.480]  stopped but Christie hasn't gotten the memo yet also interesting Fox has lowered
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.920]  the threshold for these early debates they wanted to make sure that people
[44:45.920 --> 44:51.320]  like Lindsay you don't get a lawyer Graham are included and Carly because
[44:51.320 --> 44:56.200]  I'm a woman Fiorina is included so they're taking it down taking it away
[44:56.200 --> 45:00.160]  you don't even have to have 1% support that's how they can get these people in
[45:00.160 --> 45:06.280]  there evidently they've also eliminated candidate IQ requirements so they can
[45:06.280 --> 45:10.560]  fit Rick Perry and they've lowered the gullibility threshold so they can get
[45:10.560 --> 45:14.880]  increased audience participation look this is going to be on August 6 it's
[45:14.880 --> 45:18.560]  going to be on Fox News it's going to be a big media event for them they want to
[45:18.560 --> 45:24.560]  have it to be a circus understand that this isn't even really a reality TV show
[45:24.560 --> 45:29.720]  it doesn't even rise to that level it's a poorly scripted sitcom that's all
[45:29.720 --> 45:33.520]  these debates are about we've got a confession from Donald Trump saying
[45:33.520 --> 45:38.640]  that he would consider Sarah Palin for a post in his administration this is
[45:38.640 --> 45:45.320]  Sarah Palin who supported John McCain she was John McCain's running mate she
[45:45.320 --> 45:50.760]  endorsed John McCain over a tea party candidate when he was in a tight race in
[45:50.760 --> 45:57.320]  Arizona John McCain is the guy that the Donald Trump has supposedly been at
[45:57.320 --> 46:04.080]  war with okay this is like professional wrestling folks is absolute nonsense
[46:04.080 --> 46:09.360]  Donald Trump says Republicans don't hit Hillary hard enough our country is going
[46:09.360 --> 46:13.000]  to hell yeah you know he is the Howard Beale of the Republican Party he's out
[46:13.000 --> 46:17.240]  there saying I met his hell and I'm not going to take it anymore and everybody's
[46:17.240 --> 46:20.600]  opening up their windows and shouting out I met his hell and I'm not going to
[46:20.600 --> 46:24.840]  take it anymore and I'm gonna get behind Donald Trump they don't understand what
[46:24.840 --> 46:28.520]  the problems are Donald Trump doesn't understand what the problems are he
[46:28.520 --> 46:32.720]  doesn't know what to do about it he hasn't even formulated a really clear
[46:32.720 --> 46:36.240]  idea of what the programs are have you heard him say anything about the
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.800]  Trans-Pacific Partnership about the transatlantic partnership is he
[46:39.800 --> 46:45.440]  concerned that mega corporations are writing the laws that we are having this
[46:45.440 --> 46:49.720]  global consolidation of government that a few people are going to own
[46:49.720 --> 46:53.680]  everything of course he is it he's one of the few people that's going to own
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.680]  everything he's one of the few people that already owns everything why are we
[46:57.680 --> 47:03.760]  getting behind somebody who is part of the crony capitalist elite to save us
[47:03.760 --> 47:09.960]  this is a guy who wanted to throw a woman out of their home because he wanted
[47:09.960 --> 47:15.560]  to extend the parking lot for his casino and when she refused it he went to the
[47:15.560 --> 47:20.520]  casino authority got them to use imminent domain to come after her and
[47:20.520 --> 47:25.840]  then cut it down to a quarter of what he originally offered her he did the same
[47:25.840 --> 47:29.720]  thing in Connecticut where he was working on a deal with people in
[47:29.720 --> 47:34.760]  government there to make himself rich he is the very embodiment of crony
[47:34.760 --> 47:38.840]  capitalism he isn't going to save us from things like the transatlantic
[47:38.840 --> 47:43.800]  partnership the Trans-Pacific Partnership he's gonna cut himself a deal in
[47:43.800 --> 47:49.960]  that he doesn't understand how the war and drugs creates El Chapo or violent
[47:49.960 --> 47:54.680]  crime that we see in Mexico that is now coming across into the United States
[47:54.680 --> 47:59.400]  look at this article from info wars.com MS-13 and violent street gangs are
[47:59.400 --> 48:03.920]  recruiting newly arrived illegal youth see the violence that people are fleeing
[48:03.920 --> 48:08.120]  from in El Salvador and other parts of Central and South America and Mexico
[48:08.120 --> 48:15.240]  that's all coming here it's all being made possible by prohibition it's the
[48:15.240 --> 48:20.200]  same thing that we saw with Al Capone and the Chicago street gangs except now
[48:20.200 --> 48:26.080]  it's on steroids now it's been running for decades not just 13 years before we
[48:26.080 --> 48:30.080]  appeal it it's been going now for decades is Donald Trump concerned about the
[48:30.080 --> 48:33.000]  surveillance state I haven't heard anything about that is he concerned about
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.400]  the runaway military budget is he concerned about war after war after war
[48:37.400 --> 48:41.800]  no no he wouldn't be running as Republican so I haven't seen any
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.560]  evidence that Donald Trump even understands what the problems are he's
[48:45.560 --> 48:50.560]  appealing to the frustration of the American people we understand the country
[48:50.560 --> 48:54.680]  is going down the tubes we don't know what to do about it most cases and as a
[48:54.680 --> 48:59.200]  point out we don't even understand what the problems are turning to the
[48:59.200 --> 49:03.720]  Democrats look at this article about John Stuart's secret White House visit
[49:03.720 --> 49:07.280]  say say John Stuart slipped unnoticed into the White House in the middle of
[49:07.280 --> 49:12.840]  October 2011 it was a budget fight at the time he was summoned to the Oval
[49:12.840 --> 49:18.160]  Office to have coffee with President Obama he jokingly told his escort he
[49:18.160 --> 49:21.800]  felt like he was being called to the principal's office maybe he wasn't
[49:21.800 --> 49:27.280]  getting the right message out he needed to fine-tune his message in order to
[49:27.280 --> 49:33.160]  help the president ah you thought it was just an innocent comedy show you thought
[49:33.160 --> 49:39.360]  the guy had an honest opinion you didn't realize you're being propagandized by
[49:39.360 --> 49:44.680]  John Stuart here's another one February 2014 Obama again requested Stuart to make
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.240]  the trip from Manhattan to the White House this time for a mid-morning visit
[49:48.240 --> 49:52.000]  hours before the president would go on television cameras to warn Russia that
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.480]  there will be costs if it made any further military intervention in Ukraine so
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.400]  here you are the young people the millennials the younger generation who
[50:00.400 --> 50:06.080]  are looking to John Stuart for their news and he's working with the president to
[50:06.080 --> 50:12.040]  make them cannon fodder in a war with the Russians yeah that's the kind of
[50:12.040 --> 50:15.280]  propaganda that we've got going on they say this speaks now this is Politico
[50:15.280 --> 50:18.800]  of course they agree with them politically so they cover for him not
[50:18.800 --> 50:24.480]  Camille Paglia she had some pretty harsh words about John Stuart in that article
[50:24.480 --> 50:28.960]  he won't go to that but Politico takes the position that this speaks volumes
[50:28.960 --> 50:34.880]  about John Stuart's reach no it speaks volumes about the propaganda about the
[50:34.880 --> 50:40.720]  secret cozy relationships between the media it's about how they can turn
[50:40.720 --> 50:46.440]  national politics into a heavily scripted sitcom as I said it's not a
[50:46.440 --> 50:52.040]  reality show it's a sitcom so instead of anchors like we've had in the past Dan

[56:12.760 --> 56:18.080]  life.com and we were just talking about politics we didn't talk too much about
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.600]  the Democrat side we talked a little bit about John Stewart Hillary Clinton's
[56:22.600 --> 56:27.240]  missing emails continue to come back to haunt her we should all be concerned
[56:27.240 --> 56:31.080]  about this now the newest revelation here and this is coming from the Daily
[56:31.080 --> 56:35.600]  Beast people that would normally support her they're even concerned about this I
[56:35.600 --> 56:40.880]  say there is a two month gap in Hillary Clinton's emails that coincides with the
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.040]  violence in Libya who would have thought who would have thought that those emails
[56:45.040 --> 56:51.200]  would be missing remember the 18 minutes that were missing from the nixon
[56:51.200 --> 56:57.920]  tapes okay it's got thousands of emails that are missing from two months two
[56:57.920 --> 57:03.080]  months not 18 minutes but two months are missing from the record and it
[57:03.080 --> 57:10.680]  coincides with the employment status of a top Clinton aide Huma Abedin very
[57:10.680 --> 57:15.560]  interesting several thousand emails missing it wouldn't be the case that
[57:15.560 --> 57:19.400]  Hillary Clinton is a hypocrite would it I mean she just started this global
[57:19.400 --> 57:26.480]  warming push while she travels around on a jet that's consuming 347 gallons of
[57:26.480 --> 57:32.600]  fuel every hour every hour every hour that's the kind of elitist hypocrisy
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.960]  that we see from Hillary Clinton and the global warming crowd but understand
[57:36.960 --> 57:43.080]  that this is about the whole global warming push is fraudulent I've got an
[57:43.080 --> 57:45.880]  article here and I don't have it right here I'll pull it up when we come back
[57:45.880 --> 57:52.400]  from break about the massive fraud that has been uncovered in the data of course
[57:52.400 --> 57:57.920]  we've seen the climate gate fraud I was involved in trying to get some of those
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.520]  records with a group that I was working in this was information that was paid
[58:02.520 --> 58:07.320]  for by the University we have an individual Michael Mann who is working
[58:07.320 --> 58:11.520]  at University of Virginia corresponding with the people who were covering this
[58:11.520 --> 58:15.400]  up in the UK but of course even though the public was paying for this he was
[58:15.400 --> 58:20.040]  doing it on working time even though those the his conclusions were being
[58:20.040 --> 58:25.600]  used to set up public policy we could not see the emails that's the kind of
[58:25.600 --> 58:29.240]  hypocrisy the kind of manipulation we see and of course one of her opponents
[58:29.240 --> 58:34.600]  is pointing out that hey folks Clinton voted for the Iraq war think about that
[58:34.600 --> 58:50.160]  hold that thought we'll be right back say with it another major health threat
[58:50.160 --> 58:54.360]  this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to
[58:54.360 --> 58:58.640]  drink the water Ohio governor declaring a state of emergency did you know that

[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.680]  july 29th 2015 the next segment we have another report from Paul Joseph Watson
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:40.000]  about the bankers the real criminals we're gonna talk about a crony capitalism
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.760]  we're gonna play that report for you this segment I want to go over some of
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.800]  the breaking news that's on info words.com this story lawmakers vote to
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:51.640]  let Obama take your passport without trial why not you can be put on a no
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.840]  fly list without trial without due process they don't tell you remember
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:01.320]  when I first came here back in 2012 there was a story that broke and we had a
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.800]  lot to do with it it was Doug Hagman contacted us we pushed it on our site we
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.880]  interviewed Wade Hicks who was someone who had been vetted very recently by
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.840]  both the TSA the TSA who put him on the no fly list and the FBI for firearms
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:20.960]  purchases he was flying to Japan to see his wife who was in the military he was
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.960]  flying on a military plane and when he got to Hawaii he makes his transfer he's
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:29.320]  on the plane and just before it takes off they pull him off and say you're not
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.640]  going anywhere you're on a no-fly list so they didn't know it when they flew him
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.320]  from California on a military plane to Hawaii they didn't know it he didn't know
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.040]  he was on a no-fly list he'd just been vetted by the TSA as a transportation
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:49.240]  worker he had been vetted by the FBI but he went through this long struggle
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:53.320]  because he was essentially stuck in Hawaii which is what's going to happen
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.600]  if the government takes your passport you're not going to be able to get out
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.360]  of the country it's essentially having a Berlin wall a digital Berlin wall if you
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.360]  will this is one of the reasons why I don't see a solution to the open borders
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:13.560]  as creating a massive fence ignore the fact that people can always tunnel
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.840]  under it they can always hop over they can get around a fence they can
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.660]  smuggle people in any way you want you have to remove the incentives that our
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.880]  government is providing that big corporations are providing that's why
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.480]  the US Chamber of Commerce supports it that's why the Republicans support it
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:36.320]  we have to remove the idea that we have a North American Union we need to assert
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.520]  our sovereignty but we need to stop drawing people into this country with
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.360]  lavish benefits treating them better than we treat our citizens giving them
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.240]  diplomatic immunity for crimes that are committed catch and release programs
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.160]  giving them in-state tuition in every state that we don't give to American
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.680]  citizens and on and on and on that giant sucking sound that Ross Perot talked
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.880]  about is us it's our policies it's our government policies it's what we allow
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.880]  the corporations to do because they want to export jobs and they want to import
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.920]  workers to get their costs down but it's very troubling to see yet another one of
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.860]  these issues like the no-fly list people they get put on the no-fly list they
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.360]  don't know when they're put on it they don't know why they're put on it the
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.080]  TSA will not correspond to anyone give them any information this is Star
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.920]  Chamber stuff just like we were talking about earlier the FISA court it's not
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.520]  even a court it's one judge who works for the government who rubber stamps
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.080]  everything that they want to do and we see over and over again like the no-fly
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.640]  list now this will presumably operate the same way taking your passport without
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.720]  a trial locking you in the country because that's what happened to Wade
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:51.040]  Hicks he got stuck in if you can't fly out of Hawaii how do you get out he
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.480]  eventually hopped a freighter I think to I think that was the way he got back I
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.600]  think he came back by no actually I take that back that was what he was
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.600]  planning on doing I think he worked with people in the military to get around
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.480]  that ban another thing that are coming after of course to try to control your
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.120]  movements is a new drunk driving legislation that would require
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:19.760]  breathalyzers in all new cars now of course drunk driving is a problem a lot
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.320]  of innocent people have been killed by drunk driving but we're all going to
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.360]  have to pay for this as if we were all abusers it's going to be a very expensive
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.160]  troublesome new device that we're going to have to put in there people like me
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.840]  who don't even drink alcohol will have to have a breathalyzer in their car I
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:44.200]  will have to maintain it and this is all yet another incremental approach to
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.880]  getting us to understand that we're not going to go anywhere without the
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.120]  express prior approval of our government because the next thing they
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:57.400]  will add is an analysis of have you paid all of your taxes or other fees
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.760]  you're not going to go to work if you haven't stay with us days after the deal
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.800]  with Iran was sealed secretary of defense Aston Carter said the
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.320]  possibility of Iranian aggression and the possibility that Iran will not obey
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.240]  the agreement which is why we will keep the military option which was the
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.240]  alternative to a deal John Kerry echoed Carter's diplomatic blunder by attempting
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.040]  to calm the fears of Jewish leaders at a meeting that would later be described

[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:21.920]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this one stage of my 2019-2015 I'm David
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.960]  Knight your host we're going to talk about some economic news this section
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.880]  and we're going to play a report from Paul Joseph Watson about what's going on
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.680]  with bankers in the UK but of course Alex Jones is in Europe this week he's
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.440]  doing investigative reportings about the globalist takeover there especially in
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:45.640]  some of the fringe countries like Spain and Italy just as we have seen what
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:50.520]  happened in Greece those are next on the list a lot of this is being driven by
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:57.280]  Germany Germany complaining about the profligate wasteful spending of Greece
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.280]  let me give you an article that just came out the last couple of days how
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.240]  Berlin's futuristic airport became a six billion dollar embarrassment this is
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.200]  from Bloomberg business now this is the story that goes back to 2011 they say it
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.040]  was a brand new airport the International Willie Brant Airport fall of 2011
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:25.720]  this was something that they had spent 600 million euros for 656 million
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.400]  dollars but this is something that of course is a tale of woe that goes to
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:35.440]  10 times that to six billion dollars for this airport this is a terminal on the
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.440]  outskirts of Berlin Germany's capital it was billed as Europe's most modern but
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:43.720]  the building inspectors could not believe what they saw when they got there
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:49.280]  they simulated a fire and the system went haywire some alarms failed to activate
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.280]  others indicated a fire but in the wrong part of the terminal the explanation was
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:58.760]  buried they said in the 55 mile tangle of wiring that had been laid hastily
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.960]  beneath the floors of the building where or rat technicians soon discovered
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:10.160]  high voltage power lines alongside data and heating cables a fire hazard in its
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.800]  own right that wasn't all smoke evacuation canals designed to suck out smoke
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.080]  and replace it with fresh air failed to do either and an actual fire the
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.960]  inspectors determined the main smoke vent might well implode so the chief
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.920]  executive officer of the airport Rainier Schwartz comes up with an emergency
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.520]  plan get this to allow them to open on time what he was going to do is have
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:40.520]  800 low-paid workers armed with cell phones take up positions throughout the
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:47.320]  terminal those fills with massive complicated high-tech solutions go
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:53.560]  back to just boots on the ground but of course this requires cell phones and
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.240]  they say well they're going to report this of course if they smell smoke or
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.440]  they see a fire okay but the region's cell phone networks were notoriously
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:10.000]  unreliable oops as Rick Perry would say Martin Delias said it was an idiotic
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:18.880]  plan and so on and so on and so on look every country has massive waste people
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:24.440]  make mistakes but there's also massive crony capitalism involved so it's not
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:29.920]  just incompetence but in many cases what the public views as incompetence is
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:36.240]  somebody doing something to enhance their profits that's why we need to
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:41.840]  regard with suspicion these secret trade agreements that are being written by
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:47.440]  corporations that even though we have passed the fast-track trade process we
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.480]  have still not been able to see these agreements these massive agreements are
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.440]  going to be sprung on our legislators they're not going to be able to offer any
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.560]  amendments they're going to have no filibusters allowed in the Senate 20 hours
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.720]  to talk about it and then a straight up or down vote and once it is done as
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:10.120]  Senator Sessions has pointed out it will create a transnational committee that
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:16.760]  will continually modify this document without any input from our Congress from
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.080]  our elected representatives or from any other countries elected representatives
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.800]  they will be able to add other countries at will we have an article up on
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.120]  info wars.com about how the State Department and the Obama administration
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:36.000]  are changing the human rights evaluations of Malaysia so they can be
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.280]  included in this trans-Pacific partnership but listen to this because
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:47.160]  this is one that I had not seen this is a story that is on Liberty Blitzkrieg
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.480]  bankers squirm as Congress moves to cut the six percent dividend paid to them
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.680]  by the Federal Reserve I didn't know about this this is something of course
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.560]  the Federal Reserve has been around for a little over a hundred years they say
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:01.840]  regardless of boom bust or recession the biggest Wall Street banks have been
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.720]  enjoying a six percent risk-free return on the capital that they hold at the Fed
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.040]  in the form of dividends so and what he doesn't say here is that with interest
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.880]  rates at zero percent for the bankers they get the money at zero percent they
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:23.080]  send it back to the Fed they get paid six percent and they get that tax-free
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.920]  because if the shares of the stock were acquired prior to March 28th 1942 the
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.880]  six percent risk-free individual dividend rather is tax exempt and the bank
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.080]  doesn't have to pay corporate income taxes on it how's that for an
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.720]  entitlement program absolutely amazing keep that in mind today as the private
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:50.640]  Federal Reserve that is not accountable to Congress Janet Yellen who told
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.520]  congressmen that they need to mind their own business not try to audit her not
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:00.520]  try to micromanage what they're doing they're going to meet behind closed
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:05.920]  doors and they're going to release the white smoke to let us know if rates are
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.800]  going to go up or if they're going to keep them on hold we have differing
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:14.360]  opinions from Wall Street publications that's going to be announced they say
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:19.920]  today at 1 o'clock central time I think it's 2 o'clock eastern time if I'm
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.840]  correct so we'll keep you posted on that if something comes up with that let's
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:32.560]  go to Paul Joseph Watson's report about the corruption of bankers again these
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.280]  are shots of London is this global governance at last is it one world the
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.120]  central bankers in charge aren't we all just living and dying for what the
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:46.200]  central banks do aren't we all just so typical of the way the IMF and the
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:50.880]  World Bank work that you put a country in debt it's such a big debt I can't pay
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.360]  it and then you offer refinance that debt Greek voters will be asked to rule
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.920]  on two draft documents that detail a proposal by the country's creditors to
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:08.800]  unlock aid as much as 15.5 billion euros for Greece in return for sales tax
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:15.080]  increases and pension reforms and the plan has failed this isn't just Greece
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.560]  we're talking about today the whole of the Mediterranean now finds itself in
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.680]  the wrong currency but the big banks the big businesses and big politics
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.480]  forced you in Goldman Sachs the German arms manufacturers they were all very
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.960]  happy and when the bailouts began they weren't for the Greek people those
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.840]  bailouts would have bailout French German and Italian banks they haven't
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:45.200]  helped the governments don't rule the world Goldman Sachs rules the world
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.240]  Paul Joseph Watson reporting for info wars.com outside the Bank of England in
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.960]  London and on the subject of banks of course we had HSBC slapped with fines
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:59.840]  recently for money laundering whereas when it comes to the customer of a bank
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.960]  we're being treated with more and more suspicion of course major cash withdrawals
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.880]  are now being treated suspiciously we've also got Halifax Bank today in an
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.840]  article on info wars.com where they're giving information to third parties
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:18.600]  about when and where people visit banks so the exact time location when people
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.400]  are visiting banks withdrawing money they're putting this in a database and
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:27.240]  passing it over to third parties no idea if that information remains secure we
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:30.920]  approached Halifax Bank and the third party involved in this and they
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:35.240]  basically acknowledge that that was the case they're taking the exact time and
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.280]  location when you visit the bank and then calling you up saying oh Mr Smith we
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:44.480]  know that you were at the bank last Friday we want to talk to you about the
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:48.000]  services we can offer so they're actually keeping that information your
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.120]  physical location as you go from bank to bank in a central database and then
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.480]  selling it to third parties who will then call you up and harass you and
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.960]  remember they do this under the guise of customer service they're just helping
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.960]  you by knowing and tracking the location where you visit your bank how much
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:09.640]  money you take out again going into the bank taking out amounts as small as
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.800]  5,000 pounds is being treated as suspicious activity you're having to
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:18.360]  provide documents to prove not only why you're taking out the money but also
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.760]  where it will go with documentation to prove that feds urge banks to call cops
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.520]  on customers who withdraw $5,000 or more
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:36.360]  I take a crew of five or six reporters to Europe I give them all $2,000 and they
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.000]  give me receipts but in case the cards quit working which happens all the time
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.800]  we've got money that's not we're carrying $10,000 cash on us we're not
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.240]  criminals cash is any legal this whole phony drug war the banks launder the drug
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.000]  money publicly and then they act like we're criminal taking company money or
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.080]  after-tax money out of the bank so again the stranglehold is being tightened on
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:05.120]  the ordinary customer for banks whereas big banks that commit major fraud are
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.880]  getting away with slaps on the wrist and it continues to happen we're coming
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.240]  under increasing scrutiny simply for withdrawing large amounts of cash or
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:18.320]  visiting the ATM to take out money so that's how serious it's become this is
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.360]  Paul Joseph Watson reporting live from the Bank of England for info wars dot
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.520]  com and again you having cash is criminally want to get that idea out
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:32.920]  there but if HSBC launders billions of dollars for the Sinaloa drug cartel
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:38.040]  putting El Chapo in power that's not a crime according to them they get a small
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.320]  slap on the wrist nobody goes to jail now this hour of the Alex Jones show is

[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Niger host on this Wednesday July
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:23.080]  29 2015 I was just giving a buckly came in and just gave me some articles about
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:30.120]  Ed Schultz's firing from MSNBC it's very interesting because along the lines of
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.080]  what we were talking about earlier in the show with Camille Paglia talking
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.280]  about how controlled the mainstream media is especially the left mainstream
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:45.000]  media saying that even she could not get a hearing she had to go outside of the
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.600]  media she said that's why we had the rise of alternative media that's why we
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.320]  had the rise of talk radio of Rush Limbaugh of others is because it was
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:59.520]  totally blocked totally controlled so a lot of people are asking why was Ed
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:04.560]  Schultz fired luckily gave me several articles here one of these points out
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.240]  that his ratings were much better than Chris Hayes they say people were
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:14.240]  surprised that this happened and so they're asking why is one of MSNBC's
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.280]  higher rated programs even though they are struggling across the board because
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:26.560]  of the political dishonesty of that network why are they dumping someone who
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.280]  has been very honest about pointing out the problems of the Trans-Pacific
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.960]  Partnership they pointed out that he has been relentless in calling out the
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:42.840]  problems of the TPP the TTIP these secretive deals that are being written
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:47.080]  by corporations now Republicans reflexively jump behind this when you
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:52.440]  say it's about free trade we can have a debate about free trade versus managed
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:57.480]  trade we can have that debate but that's not what this is about this is
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.160]  about crony capitalism it's not about free trade this is about setting up a
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.760]  structure where a few corporations own and control everything it's about
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:12.960]  setting these corporations up at the level or superior to the governments it's
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.600]  about sovereignty it's about world government quite frankly we've talked
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:23.240]  about this many times here but one of the few voices on mainstream cable news
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.920]  opposing this was Ed Schultz they say when it comes to coverage of the
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.080]  Trans-Pacific Partnership no one in corporate media covered the issue more
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:35.600]  than Ed Schultz on MSNBC's The Ed Show when it was announced last week that
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  they were pulling the plug from his program they effectively killed the
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.840]  only national voice that was talking about the disaster of a trade deal on
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:47.320]  cable news the only one on cable news talking about it they say between August
[01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:53.920]  1st and 2013 media matters I'm sorry between August 1st 2013 and January 31st
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:59.520]  2015 two-year period media matters says that Ed Schultz covered the TPP on 71
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:03.040]  different segments not including the time that he brought up the issue during
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.880]  the network's coverage of the State of the Union address in 2015 now that's
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.760]  from Ring of Fire reverb press says there's been a surge of faithful Ed
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.800]  Schultz fans posting on social media in the last few days angry that the Ed
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:23.040]  Show is reportedly getting canceled they've made petitions even presidential
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.800]  candidate Bernie Sanders has come to Schultz's defense saying that he's very
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.320]  disappointed that Comcast chose to remove Ed Schultz from its lineup
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.920]  Bernie Sanders said we need more people who talk about the real issues that are
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:42.040]  facing our country not fewer people that's the whole point when we look at
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:50.080]  MSNBC when we look at Fox News we get the same narrowly defined issues they
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.560]  will not talk about many of the existential issues facing our country
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:28:00.720]  or we will get the same thing from MSNBC that we get from Fox News when it
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:07.520]  comes to things like the TPP or the TTIP we don't get another opinion do you see
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:13.160]  anybody on those channels talking about the out-of-control illegal war on drugs
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.480]  anybody other than say Judge Napolitano oh that's right he got his show
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.160]  canceled too didn't he they still have him on occasionally as a commentator on
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:28.320]  Fox but they don't want to have a voice out there that opposes what the
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.200]  leadership of both Republican and the Democrat parties are pushing on us we
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.760]  can see this very clearly we can see Megyn Kelly at Fox News talking about
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.200]  how our mandatory vaccines big brother yes she says of course they're big
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:46.200]  brother but sometimes you need big brother yeah those times are when your
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:52.880]  corporate sponsors pay for 75% of your programming on network television that's
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.320]  when your boss Rupert Murdoch and his son are involved with big pharmaceutical
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.160]  companies that's when you need big brother and they don't hesitate pushing
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.040]  big brother at Fox News they don't hesitate pushing wars for the military
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.640]  industrial complex either and neither do people like Hillary Clinton as we just
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.360]  pointed out but of course she gets a pass on that because she's a Clinton
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.960]  she's a woman whatever because of her identity that's precisely what Camille
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:25.080]  Poglio was saying she said we need to have an honest and open discussion there
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.720]  are many existential important issues that people on both the left and the
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:33.880]  right would agree with we need to start having those discussions and quite
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.720]  frankly I don't see anybody in either party that is talking about those
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.520]  things except for Rand Paul he's the one who will confront the surveillance
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:48.080]  state he will confront and vote against the trans-pacific partnership stay with
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:54.400]  us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:11.560]  There's a need for new world order but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:23.320]  Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones we've seen
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:29.520]  the recent looting of Greece Puerto Rico in trouble the crisis in China and of
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.200]  course we're going to be investigating what's happening in Spain what's
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.440]  happening in Rome they're reporting that Rome is basically on the edge of
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:39.720]  collapse that's the city leaders saying that because infrastructure is not being
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:44.600]  built money is being siphoned off to globalist operations but remember back
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:52.720]  in 2011 when John Corzine the former head of Goldman Sachs the MF global head
[01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:57.720]  rated people's private accounts for millions of dollars and it took him
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:04.440]  years to pay it all back anybody else would have gone to prison and that ties
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.480]  into the fact that most the welfare is corporate welfare and that's why they
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.840]  want to shut down real economies and get everybody else on welfare-dependent
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.360]  so that we all have a stake in this giant scam so folks have asked me to do
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.560]  these comedy satire pieces more I really am too focused too serious to do in
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.240]  these days but I thought I'd bring back from the vault from 2011 December 9th
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:31.880]  almost four years ago a piece where I played the part of Don John Corzine
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.160]  saying he's a mafia boss you know Baker in a top hat and then I basically
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:43.640]  interview myself in this piece to try to illustrate just how insane this fraud is
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:48.440]  and it ties into everything we see today with the derivatives and the rest of it
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:52.800]  the problem isn't better it's much much worse
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:58.760]  we have people like John Corzine the big White House financial advisor the
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:03.720]  former head of Goldman Sachs stealing billions of dollars and saying I don't
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.640]  know where it went I'm not going to discuss it and Congress is like hmm okay
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:15.440]  well thank you we've got a serious issue so I thought we would talk to well the
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:21.760]  evil spirit that possesses John Corzine Don Corleone John Corzine directly
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:29.720]  teleporting in from Hades orbiting a deep space galactic nebula and he joins
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:38.440]  us right now top hat and all to explain to us why he's doing what he's doing
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.680]  well it's good to talk to you I know you're a proud of all of your looting
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:49.200]  and creative destruction mr. Corzine it's good to have you here mr. Beelzebub
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.840]  or Corzine I'm Beelzebub I know the proper name thank you for thank you for
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.240]  joining us oh it's incredible all the people are gonna throw out of their
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.720]  houses and we've almost shut down all the industry and only if you're a globalist
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:03.560]  insider we'll be able to even operate in their business and we're setting the
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:06.760]  press it's still everything oh I didn't realize the interview was live right now
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.720]  but it doesn't matter if I got caught saying that just like the ATF got caught
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:12.520]  shipping all those guns in the Mexico and their own memos saying they blame on
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:16.680]  the second amendment nothing will be done to the Attorney General and nothing
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:19.480]  will be done to me because we've got criminals in place everywhere and it
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.640]  doesn't matter if you're stolen millions out of your private accounts from
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:26.360]  IMF global is right under someone's nose no one can stop us oh but I'm a good
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.480]  person that cares I don't know where the money is I'm sorry you wanted to you
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.880]  wanted to interview me I'm I'm here now to be talked to about you wow you give a
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:42.280]  new definition to the name fast talker look nobody's buying you in Congress
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:46.160]  saying that you have no idea what went on and that you know that where the money
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:54.800]  went so why don't you just go ahead and tell us where the money is oh I spoke
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.400]  before the honorable Congress and I have $35,000 plate dinners with the
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.640]  honorable Obama and just like we got away with it some people would say but
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:07.760]  of course we didn't we're doing God's work one of my counterparts said the
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:13.240]  head of Goldman Sachs just like we were able to take 16 plus trillion and
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:16.440]  transport our foreign subsidiaries we're going to be able to do this as well you
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.720]  think one billion two billion three billion of people's private segregated
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:23.440]  accounts of a company we took over is a big deal it's nothing because see I am
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.160]  distinguished I'm wearing a top hat I'm wearing a suit and I have a beard a
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:33.360]  grandfatherly beard and so everything is fine okay we understand your trendy and
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.200]  and super stylish and hang out with all the establishment criminals but but
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.480]  but seriously if I've written down some questions here I want to ask you how
[01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:47.000]  could you in one year take a profitable company like MF global and run it into
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:54.600]  the ground and steal people's private sequestered or segregated accounts under
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:04.040]  federal law is a crime how how could you do that please answer the question
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.800]  how could I do the great things I did at MF global in a year you see you're
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.800]  thinking about actually building up a company we're talking about command
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.960]  destruction or out of chaos we're talking about using MF global as a
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.840]  globalist mafia instrument to go buy up legitimate companies with people's
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.520]  private bank accounts and then take that money and give it to our shareholders
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:25.440]  and people that are on the advisory board like Bill Clinton that's how this
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:29.720]  works you see with Europe and the tens of trillions being transferred by the
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:33.120]  Federal Reserve private consortium that Goldman Sachs and I headed up as part of
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:36.640]  Europe is not ever meant to pay back the tens of trillions of US taxpayer back
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.920]  money they're meant to go deeper into debt through debt bondage we create the
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:43.200]  derivatives fraud and the rest of the world and our operatives who run their
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.040]  countries sign everyone on to our debt so I didn't run the company into the
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.000]  ground you don't ask a bank robber who successfully robs a bank you know why did
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.280]  he fail he succeeded just because there's some dead guards and a million
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.640]  dollars cash missing that's the proof of the success we're not screwing anything
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.720]  up when Congress asked us how do we learn from this and not do this again
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.280]  we're learning how much you'll put up with and the whole media that we control
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:06.720]  I'm sorry I have to attend a grand father like the loving reasonable media
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:13.600]  bought and paid for by our people we hate everybody you think we're just gonna stop
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.160]  what we've done here in the US we like a million dead Iraqis and stolen oil and
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.560]  trillions of dollars of no big contracts for sandwich killers and you naive people
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.520]  figure it out I'm sorry I don't know where the money man isn't that reasonable I
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.360]  was the CEO and everybody knows we took the private accounts it's illegal but
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:31.520]  never mind about that you heard the Attorney General yesterday in testimony
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:34.080]  they said we have your memos where you parted yourself about fast and fierce
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:38.960]  and he said we didn't intend to lie you've got to get your guns before we
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.720]  really steal everything you've got I'm sorry little reporter what else was it
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:45.880]  you had to say you and your info warriors may be somewhat awake but the rest of
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.840]  public's brain damage from toxic fluoride and Ridland and Brozac and
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.680]  guzzling alcohol and watching brainwashing television and there's
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.320]  nothing they won't put up with they love being slaves because I'm just a nice
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.400]  little grandfather in person was there something else you wanted to sit on
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.880]  Santa's knee and ask for Mr. Jones okay well people notice that all over the
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:08.960]  third world Latin America Asia Africa Middle East Western Europe Eastern
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.560]  Europe all over the world every country you take down either has Goldman Sachs
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:20.040]  people in place the ministers the presidents all of them the heads of the
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:26.120]  Treasury systems the finance ministers are all Goldman Sachs and we notice that
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:30.440]  then the solution you offer is only gives your own system or power when you
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:34.720]  sold the fraudulent derivatives I mean this is incredibly obvious that you
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:39.200]  guys are economic terrorists I mean who do you work for what's going what's
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:44.240]  going on here what's the end game is there any end to how you are gang
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:48.640]  raping the world population and I mean I know your whore media worships you but
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.520]  I mean is there any end to their groveling to your criminal activity as
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:59.320]  they try their own future how does Goldman Sachs help the world economy you're
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.400]  asking how do we how do we get control of every nation and implode them that's
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.880]  what called an economic takeover for decades we get our people into the
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:11.080]  prime ministerships the presidency's into the Department of Treasuries or
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:17.120]  Exchequer in Greece Iceland you name it Australia Germany France Italy they're
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.000]  all Goldman Sachs alumni you can have upwards of 70 people at a Bilderberg
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.080]  meeting of 130 that are Goldman Sachs and we're kind of the Darth Vader to
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.920]  Emperor Palpatine that's JP Morgan Chase and then we go out and then we we do
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.720]  the thieving and the stealing and the imploding and and we call it free market
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.120]  when we create trillions of fake derivatives and sell them to people and
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.000]  then have government bail it out with taxpayer money that's called conservative
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.600]  but of course it doesn't matter if it's Bill Clinton who helped get rid of the
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.680]  laws that allowed us to do this or George W Bush or Obama we buy them all
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:46.560]  and while the public's debating liberal conservative we are taking over
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.360]  everything and that's the proof in survival of the fittest social
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.760]  Darwinism we have the power we were able to do this so it's our right to do it
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.800]  kind of like Hitler said Mike makes right if I can dominate you and take you
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.200]  over and you don't stop me well then you deserve what's happened to you do you
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.600]  understand that little worms American people people the world you're not
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:12.080]  gonna do anything to stop us because I am a nice old man I'm trending okay well
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.800]  you certainly are craven and craved and and a mesmerized brain damaged
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:20.240]  population serving you I can understand you've become quite delusional like
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:26.560]  Caligula or some of the Aztec Kings Gary Gensler was your main minion at
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:32.080]  Goldman Sachs and he headed up the CFTC he's been missing now for a month and he
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.360]  was the guy supposedly regulating you I mean this is pretty obvious what you're
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.960]  doing what's going on with you and Gary Gensler what's going on with you and I
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.560]  mean do you guys run everything I mean could you barbecue children on the
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:49.440]  White House lawn could you could you abuse elephants at Central Park I mean
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:53.800]  is there nothing you couldn't do is there anything you won't do to us land
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:02.000]  of the coward home of the slave oh great satanic goblin leader Gary Gensler
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.360]  Gary Gensler maybe I don't like to be asked about this maybe I should read a
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.880]  40 page and that's what it is I've got a copy of it over here maybe I should read
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.000]  a 40 plus page opening statements so all the networks tune out about growing up
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.240]  as a child I'm just like everybody else I'm just like everybody else so you'll
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:22.760]  let down your guard Gary Gensler was my right-hand man at Goldman Sachs selling
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.760]  County cities and private individuals and pensioners fraudulent paper that we
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.360]  knew was totally worthless like in our Timberwolf emails where we called our
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:33.640]  customers dumb efforts and you know so we're selling them SH you know what IT
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.960]  this is a family show I know that I'm not saying the full thing Gary the head of
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.520]  the CFTC has disappeared the last few weeks no one knows where he is but the
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:43.160]  media's bottom paid for no one will even point that out made off as one of our
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.520]  people he's a great guy people got a little too much on to him we've got
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.120]  some other wolves occasionally and Gensler my right-hand man from Goldman
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.480]  Sachs runs the CFTC and allowed me to do all this it's it's it's it's really been
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:58.360]  quite quite fabulous in the final equation well this is our interview with
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.600]  the demon that possesses John Corzine he his his voice is sped up because
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.880]  something about the machinery Chekhov was explaining to me causes a time
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:12.520]  distortion so it's sped up my question I understand that but somebody with
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:20.760]  Einstein and what's happening there but but I wanted to show you see this some
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:25.360]  funny money we bought this in a store today for I think like $3 and some of
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.520]  these are $1 bills summer 5 summer 10s summer 20 summer hundreds summer
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:35.480]  thousands but you know three bucks you we basically got a couple hundred
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:43.080]  thousand dollars here and it says the play money of America but it actually
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:51.920]  has as real the same intrinsic value as this that says Federal Reserve note and
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.760]  you can see where it says Federal Reserve note here up in the top left-hand
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:01.200]  corner we can zoom in on that you know until the Federal Reserve took over in
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:06.680]  1913 it said it said United States note and it was backed by silver and gold and
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.880]  later they phased that out Kennedy tried to reissue Lincoln greenbacks that
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.400]  have been issued of course they assassinated him when he'd issued five
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.800]  billion he was gonna issue 40 plus billion but but but but what is the
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:26.320]  difference between this funny money here that isn't legal tender and the fraud you
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.760]  issue because you weren't content to be able to control the issuance of this and
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.600]  buy up the world with it you created tens of trillions well actually thousand
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.560]  plus trillion a total of fake derivatives and of course I know in
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:43.760]  Zimbabwe they don't have the world's biggest note for hyperinflation $100
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:47.760]  trillion and I'll show the viewers a document cam shot of that so what's the
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:53.320]  difference between this stuff I bought at the local costume shop when I was
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:46:00.200]  getting the beard you're wearing and this Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe 100 trillion
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:06.160]  and this $100 bill that basically is about the same value as a $5 bill in
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:11.200]  the 1960s or this deception dollar put out you know showing the fiat currency
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.480]  and exposing the new world order what is the difference between all of these can
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:20.800]  you give me some rational answer in closing to how you guys have taken over
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:23.760]  government with all this fraudulent paper and just because you wear suits and
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.800]  top hats it's supposedly all okay our master plan is a destroy civilization
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.600]  and to have a post-industrial neo feudalistic serve system that Maury
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.120]  strong the UN Ted Turner Prince Philip Prince Charles and others openly called
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.080]  for we're gonna make you pay a lot more for a lot less we're gonna shut down
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.960]  most of infrastructure we're gonna shut down your farms and there's any dust hey
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:44.000]  as listed as a pollutant but all of our friends that will give him total waivers
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000]  we're taking over everything in a cunning white collar fraud with armies of
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.800]  control freak socialists that are ignorant as the day is long and really
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:53.000]  believe they're gonna get promise from our table even as they witness us
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.880]  destroying the society I'm gonna control the right wingers as well who will
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:59.280]  endorse any amount of blank checks to us in bailouts calling it free market we've
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.360]  got the whole thing figured out that's the in-game world government openly run
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.360]  by the bankers openly run by Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Bank of America Wells
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.720]  Fargo the Bank of England that's what we've got set up even now we criticize you

[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:28.480]  I've got some more news about the recall efforts in California to try to recall the senator who pushed through this mandatory vaccine bill that denies people their informed consent
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:35.480]  before I get to that I'll let you know that this hour of the Alex Jones show has been brought to you by our products that we sell at info wars life.com

[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:44.480]  there's an effort going on in California to recall the doctor and state senator Richard Pan received a lot of money by the way from big pharmaceutical companies as contributions
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:55.480]  he pushed through a bill SB 277 to remove informed consent from children to basically hold a gun to their head and say your kid is not going to get into school public or private
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:56:13.480]  unless you take all the vaccines that we say at the times that we say just as we were talking earlier about how Camille Paglia supports abortion but she is outraged by the way the media has covered up
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:28.480]  and has spun the story about the baby parts and the cell of these baby parts we can disagree about the safety and the effectiveness of vaccines but can't we all agree that we don't want to be forced by government
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:37.480]  we don't want government holding a gun to our head and telling us that we have to take certain medical treatments we want to be able to make that decision ourselves
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.480]  make it for ourselves make it for our families but that's precisely what pan has done
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:52.480]  holding on to your head for you to take a product for which the vaccine companies have already gotten government to give them zero liability
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:57:09.480]  they have immunity from any liability but you will not get immunity from these vaccines now the recall is not on just yet proponents have until December 31 to collect 35,926 verified signatures from voters in his district
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:21.480]  I would suggest that you look to see how you can help do that I know being involved in petition movements in the past that there are certain things that you can do to help even if you're not in the state
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:29.480]  but what we're talking about vaccines and what we're talking about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines look at the story from the Washington Post that came out a couple of days ago
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:42.480]  they say imperfect vaccines could make viruses more dangerous at least for chickens they're not going to admit that there's any problems for human vaccines listen to the way they cow-tow to big pharma this is the Washington Post
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:52.480]  they say vaccines widely used by humans today especially those used to protect children against mumps, measles and other potential deadly ailments are what we'd call perfect vaccines
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:58:04.480]  are you serious are you serious they're perfect vaccines so the vaccines that we have MMR that we're holding a gun to people's head for that we have to give big pharmaceutical companies legal immunity
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:18.480]  why would we have to give them legal immunity if these are perfect vaccines no they're not safe they're not effective they say new research suggests that imperfect or leaky vaccines might affect animals like chickens like farm animals
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:32.480]  this new research shows a herpes like virus mercs disease is now made more deadly by the vaccines that's the bottom line foundation but of course don't worry it had never happened to humans will it
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:39.480]  now the only people that are protected by these things are the companies that sell them stay with us we'll be right back with Steve quill

[01:59:50.480 --> 02:00:00.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:31.480]  welcome back to the alex jones show I'm David Knight your host today joining us in the next segment will be Steve quill
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:53.480]  I have an amazing story up on info words dot com about fraud in the IRS say it ain't so me of all people would you expect the IRS fraud I'm going to get to the details of that but first I want to continue with what I was talking about the previous segment about the Washington Post covering up for the failures of vaccines
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:01:14.480]  they had to report the story but they bury this stuff on the back pages it is there we need to shine the light on this story we need to pass this around because they start out the story by saying no no no understand the human vaccines are perfect however however in farm animals we can see that there are leaky vaccines
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:31.480]  what do they mean by leaky vaccines well this is a particular study that was published on Monday and PLOS biology these are researchers at Penn State University and people who are head of the avian viral diseases program at the Purbride Institute
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:48.480]  they're looking at something called Merrick's disease this is a herpes like virus that infects chickens they say it's highly contagious Merrick's disease didn't used to be deadly but now chicken farmers are seeing increasingly virulent strains in their broods
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:02:07.480]  the people who did this study say they don't know whether the vaccines for the disease actually caused the virulent strains the more virulent strains to develop but according to their research those more dangerous strains have developed and it's the existence of the vaccine that allows them to continue existing
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:26.480]  now let's talk about these perfect vaccines MMR for example ignoring the issues of the things that they put into it like formaldehyde and mercury and those sorts of things and the effects that it's going to have on you when you inject formaldehyde and mercury into your bloodstream or your child's bloodstream we've talked about that at length
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:44.480]  understand that in terms of safety and effectiveness in terms of leakiness for example we've had studies in New York in 2011 we've had the medical profession talk about the puzzlement of how patient zero in a measles outbreak have been twice vaccinated
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:58.480]  and all of the four people who contacted measles from patient zero who had been twice vaccinated had also been vaccinated how could that happen they say and yet we see these stories over and over and over again
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:10.480]  herd mentality is all they're selling us there is no such thing as herd immunity simply a herd mentality you can see it in real herds of animals
[02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:23.480]  but they won't admit that it happens with humans now to the IRS fraud that I mentioned IRS used instant messaging system to hide internal communications they had their own parallel messaging system
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:37.480]  imagine that where would they get an idea like that from Hillary Clinton no this kind of corruption the systemic gaming of the system this hiding their criminal activity is systemic throughout the federal government
[02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:52.480]  here's yet another case of the IRS this is reported by ATR.org the IRS used a wholly separate instant messaging system that automatically deleted office communications according to documentation released by the House Oversight Committee on Monday
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:04:07.480]  the system appears to have been purposely purposely used by agency officials responsible for the targeting of conservative nonprofits in order to evade public scrutiny now these are the same people this is lowest learners gang
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:27.480]  okay these are the same people that were targeting tea party organizations and we just reported earlier this last last couple of days how they were assessing fines to donors to these organizations giving them a 35% gift donation tax
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:41.480]  which has been overturned by the Supreme Court which hasn't been used since the 1980s they say the office known as office communications server OCS was used by IRS officials including many in the exempt organizations unit headed by lowest learner
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:53.480]  they told us they destroyed the hard drives we said baloney you haven't lost that stuff you've got backup procedures and eventually they said oh yeah that's right and now we find out they had a completely parallel messaging system
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:05:13.480]  this was intentional fraud criminal activity by the IRS stay with us as the Senate moves to defund Planned Parenthood sponsors are scrambling to disassociate themselves from the abortionist Republicans in the Senate are moving swiftly forward with plans to defund Planned Parenthood
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:28.480]  as gruesome videos exposing the organization's involvement in fetal organ harvesting continue to emerge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has appointed a group to craft a measure to deal with the horrendous videos
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:44.480]  the group which includes Senator Rand Paul and James Langford who have already introduced legislation to defund the nonprofit organization well they met yesterday afternoon to discuss the way forward responding to the announcement over the upcoming defunding vote
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:58.480]  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid responded bluntly good luck with that Hillary Clinton has received donations from Planned Parenthood for her presidential campaign and you can learn more right now at info wars dot com
