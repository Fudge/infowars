[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:38.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  It's such old news but still incredibly important news for our listeners that won't be breaking
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.280]  but I never even mentioned it yesterday because of that but to see the
[00:47.280 --> 00:55.280]  Washington Times and other old-time establishment media reporting headlines
[00:55.280 --> 01:02.560]  like Navy SEAL families say helicopter crash was inside job to see that
[01:02.560 --> 01:10.560]  headline and to see it getting coverage was simply simply amazing we've got a
[01:10.560 --> 01:18.120]  Navy SEAL coming on the broadcast today not to talk about that subject but to
[01:18.120 --> 01:21.640]  talk about being at the events last week when the World War two vets and others
[01:21.640 --> 01:25.000]  pulled down the barricades he said he believed they're trying to push veterans
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.280]  into striking at the criminal government as a false flag so they can roll out
[01:30.280 --> 01:34.840]  some type of civil war against the American people that is exactly what's
[01:34.840 --> 01:42.760]  going on and so we look forward to the highly decorated Navy SEAL a retired
[01:42.760 --> 01:49.600]  Nick Benjamin Smith joining us coming up in the second of the time he's on
[01:49.600 --> 01:54.640]  coming up in the third hour today they'll be joining us via telephone I'd like
[01:54.640 --> 01:57.560]  to get him in here in person or be a Skype but he's on the roads he'll be
[01:57.560 --> 02:03.600]  joining us coming up in T-minus two hours if I saw a little bit out of it
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.920]  today and my voice is still a little bit blown from Saturday getting excited at
[02:07.920 --> 02:11.400]  the Alamo at the open carry March and then I have a lot of back problems but
[02:11.400 --> 02:14.320]  it you know it goes out my lower back a couple times a year especially I'm
[02:14.320 --> 02:18.080]  trying to get back in shape and jog I don't stretch enough but then I made
[02:18.080 --> 02:21.880]  the mistake when my back was hurting yesterday to go out with John McAfee and
[02:21.880 --> 02:27.800]  shoot 50 cows handheld which you don't think's that big of a kick but we were
[02:27.800 --> 02:32.880]  like shooting 10 rounds at a time and actually hitting targets about 150 yards
[02:32.880 --> 02:38.240]  away just handheld by a line of sight with tracers shooting dead trees it's
[02:38.240 --> 02:43.320]  pretty amazing footage nobody's ever seen McAfee shoot there's lots of footage
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.160]  of him with guns and he did a spoof video of him like Tony Montana you know a
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.840]  comedy video with women all around him and cocaine on his face which was a
[02:51.840 --> 02:57.680]  joke video he put out the media runs it like it's real I mean I like when I
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.560]  dressed up like the Joker one time to do a spoof video they say I really think
[03:01.560 --> 03:08.160]  I'm the Joker and I'm crazy but he's never before been seen firing guns will
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.480]  be pretty viral and also interesting when he had to say about the second
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.440]  amendment more John McAfee's definitely a character he just left Austin this
[03:17.440 --> 03:21.720]  morning but that that footage will be out tomorrow night because there's a
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.880]  bunch of it and we're gonna put it all together edited together nice but tonight
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.000]  on the nightly news we will have some excerpts of some other interviews I did
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  with John McAfee and so that is coming up on M4's nightly news tonight 7 o'clock
[03:35.000 --> 03:42.120]  central but side issue I only shot like 50 rounds out of the Barrett's and I
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.000]  forgot to do what I've always wanted to do is shoot two at the same time just for
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.320]  fun we didn't do that because we didn't bring enough ammo by the time I wanted to
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.600]  do that we've gone through I don't know a hundred rounds of ammo or whatever it
[03:53.600 --> 03:59.760]  was and 10 clips we already preloaded but we do have John McAfee firing a 50
[03:59.760 --> 04:07.760]  cowl from the hip and in fact one time we were shooting it at cow feeders old
[04:07.760 --> 04:12.480]  cow feeders old plastic cow feeder buckets at 300 yards away with tracers
[04:12.480 --> 04:16.320]  of course it was broad daylight so you would just see almost like a white line
[04:16.320 --> 04:21.320]  but with line of sight he actually hit one of the one of the feeders from the
[04:21.320 --> 04:25.720]  hip the feeders about two feet tall about two feet wide little yellow feeder
[04:25.720 --> 04:30.320]  he actually hit it at like 300 yards firing from the hip talking about a
[04:30.320 --> 04:36.040]  video game I mean that is just awesome I'm now addicted to firing 50s from the
[04:36.040 --> 04:42.120]  hip the problem is I can't walk today I made the joke this is my back therapy is
[04:42.120 --> 04:48.320]  shooting the 50 well no it's not back therapy I'm now like twisted so I don't
[04:48.320 --> 04:51.680]  know put up with me today I feel like I have ice picks being jammed in my back

[08:24.560 --> 08:28.600]  the government's trying to start a civil war he's going to be joining us coming
[08:28.600 --> 08:38.240]  up in the third hour today it is already Tuesday the 22nd day of October 2013 I
[08:38.240 --> 08:45.200]  am your host Alex Jones thank you so much for joining us we're here Monday
[08:45.200 --> 08:49.200]  through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central back weeknights with the info wars
[08:49.200 --> 08:55.240]  nightly news with myself and the rest of the great team while where to start I
[08:55.240 --> 09:01.200]  want to just explain something to new listeners who tune in to the broadcast
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.320]  and maybe asking you know why are we saying that we're going into a collapse
[09:06.320 --> 09:14.960]  and how do we know that there is is going to be a collapse how do we know
[09:14.960 --> 09:19.240]  that well we know that they have created over a thousand trillion in
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.640]  derivatives they have connected the world economy to that infected all the
[09:23.640 --> 09:28.120]  major pension funds infected all the government systems and corporate
[09:28.120 --> 09:35.600]  systems and are maneuvering the answer to that crisis being a planetary world
[09:35.600 --> 09:42.520]  government so that is the reason that we point out that we don't know exactly
[09:42.520 --> 09:51.120]  how this accelerated collapse is going to unfold but we know that one way or
[09:51.120 --> 10:04.320]  another it's an untenable situation and the open engineers of this plan plan on
[10:04.320 --> 10:21.160]  using this global crisis that they have created to bring in their world
[10:21.160 --> 10:30.200]  government so we're going to be obviously continuing to break all of that down
[10:30.200 --> 10:38.480]  today hey I'm good guys I'm good I'm good in here it was no big deal but just
[10:38.480 --> 10:43.600]  somebody strung the phone cord up underneath my desk and and so it got
[10:43.600 --> 10:52.480]  knocked off the hook so I just fixed it so no not a big deal but continuing
[10:52.480 --> 11:06.680]  here obama care obviously is designed to implode the rest of the economy and our
[11:06.680 --> 11:12.440]  journey towards basic Sovietization will be complete and homeland security is
[11:12.440 --> 11:23.160]  publicly set up to mop up the American people it is publicly set up to set up a
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.520]  domestic surveillance grid and the secret police grid to wage war against the
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.720]  people and that's why the police more and more act in a imperious nature and
[11:32.720 --> 11:37.640]  I'm going to get into the world news here in a moment but I wanted to first talk
[11:37.640 --> 11:43.760]  about something I saw driving into work last Wednesday it had been raining very
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.440]  hard it had stopped raining but I saw a black unmarked police car completely
[11:48.440 --> 11:54.080]  t-boned surrounded by state police and others right in front of a big church
[11:54.080 --> 12:00.280]  where police my month before had run our nanny off the road and a bunch of other
[12:00.280 --> 12:07.800]  cars just driving around everyone and then coming over into the lane it was
[12:07.800 --> 12:11.480]  funny because they caused a wreck there about a month before that almost killed
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.480]  some people I don't know what happened to this poor officer but there he was and
[12:16.480 --> 12:22.200]  I thought well I bet he's in bad shape well he died he died and then yesterday
[12:22.200 --> 12:27.040]  I was driving into work and normally it takes me 45 minutes it took me about an
[12:27.040 --> 12:33.320]  hour and 15 minutes because all the way up the highway 290 were four or five
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.560]  motorcycle cops at every intersection and they were standing out in the
[12:37.560 --> 12:42.440]  medians and sometimes the traffic would stop so my my car stopped right in
[12:42.440 --> 12:47.280]  front of the motorcycle police after about an hour of driving and I said I
[12:47.280 --> 12:54.120]  said hi officer what's going on and he yelled at me keep moving this is while
[12:54.120 --> 13:00.240]  my car was stopped and he was five feet angled out standing in the median and
[13:00.240 --> 13:04.680]  bugged his eyes out me like he wanted to club my head in so then I got my video
[13:04.680 --> 13:08.240]  camera out my iPhone I said well when I get to this next group rolling at half a
[13:08.240 --> 13:12.680]  mile an hour and stop and go I'll ask them so I get up to the next group and
[13:12.680 --> 13:16.560]  they didn't act like they wanted to kill me they just said don't worry about it
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.120]  because after all I just applied tax money I'm a blood bag for the government
[13:20.120 --> 13:25.840]  I mean I'm just here to supply blood to the mosquito government and then they
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.000]  saw me filming and as I roll by we're like looking completely angry and
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.360]  completely upset like and their mouths were hanging up in fact I even have
[13:33.360 --> 13:36.240]  video of this because I swung the iPhone back maybe I should put a piece
[13:36.240 --> 13:41.360]  together they were so amazed that I would even talk to them because they're so
[13:41.360 --> 13:44.480]  used to the general public that's that's gotta be one of the most cowardly
[13:44.480 --> 13:49.800]  populations in human history the opposite of our founders they see cops they
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.320]  grovel I mean if a cop gets behind somebody they start weaving and freak
[13:53.320 --> 14:00.080]  out and panic I mean people see cops they fall down in fear on average now and I
[14:00.080 --> 14:03.920]  remember like 10 years ago in places like New York City I would say hi officer
[14:03.920 --> 14:07.480]  do you know where such and such subway entrances and they would scream do I
[14:07.480 --> 14:14.160]  look like a phone book now not all New York police are like that I know a lot
[14:14.160 --> 14:17.040]  of more listeners and I run into some nice ones and I've been there but a lot
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.760]  of them are just imperious thugs just like the TSA ad last year said we want
[14:21.760 --> 14:27.240]  to hire imperious people that are domineering and I guess the definition
[14:27.240 --> 14:35.240]  of imperious is arrogantly domineering in people's face unreasonably commanding
[14:35.240 --> 14:39.960]  that's what the big foreign banks that run America are like and so that's the
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.120]  attitude they're pushing for a warrior class of police who don't fight with the
[14:44.120 --> 14:47.600]  drug gangs the big banks that launder the money they only go over to low level
[14:47.600 --> 14:50.440]  drug gangs that don't want to the money properly and they're just there to
[14:50.440 --> 14:54.080]  generate revenue and do all these home invasions and all the rest of it
[14:54.080 --> 14:58.960]  imperious having or showing the proud and unpleasant attitude of someone who
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.160]  gives orders and expects other people to obey them benefiting or befitting a
[15:04.160 --> 15:10.280]  characteristic of one of imminent rank or attainments marked by arrogant
[15:10.280 --> 15:16.880]  assurance lawyer those are not the definitions and again I did this as a
[15:16.880 --> 15:21.360]  test plus I was on the phone with Watson in between the hour I was just in this
[15:21.360 --> 15:24.720]  particular piece of traffic and I said I think it's either gonna be the
[15:24.720 --> 15:30.880]  president at a fundraiser or it's gonna be a police officer funeral and I said
[15:30.880 --> 15:36.120]  I'll see when I get to the office when I got here sure enough at 11 o'clock he
[15:36.120 --> 15:44.280]  was set to come down that road in the procession so at at at 9 o'clock in the
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.200]  morning they had all these motorcycle cops out there just preparing to shut
[15:49.200 --> 15:55.960]  down one of the most choked points of 71 290 been white in Austin Texas and
[15:55.960 --> 15:58.840]  again I think the guy should have a nice send off or whatever they want to
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.840]  have a parade for him or whatever or something like that my issue is he died
[16:02.840 --> 16:08.840]  hydroplaning driving in to be on duty not even on duty is what I was reading
[16:08.840 --> 16:15.440]  and he hydroplained like thousands of people do every year and die and I'm
[16:15.440 --> 16:19.240]  surprised they didn't just line up some citizens and execute them or maybe give
[16:19.240 --> 16:23.720]  him a Viking burial and just pile up some random citizens on a on a Viking
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.200]  ship and set us all on fire that's how the Vikings would do it when when a
[16:27.200 --> 16:29.920]  muckety muck would die just to show they were more important than other people
[16:29.920 --> 16:34.720]  they would you know burn maybe their whole household women with them there's
[16:34.720 --> 16:39.040]  nobody else want to be around the the elitist spoiled women so that's kind of
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.920]  maybe a good Viking custom to burn all them up a little sarcastic I'm sure
[16:43.920 --> 16:50.760]  Odin says we must burn his women yes all the spoiled rotten nobles women yes you
[16:50.760 --> 16:56.880]  will now be burned sorry anyways you imagine how spoiled noblemans women
[16:56.880 --> 17:02.360]  are the point is is that they didn't used to do stuff like this when when that
[17:02.360 --> 17:09.520]  Navy seal Chris Kyle died they shut down I 35 for like four or five hours the
[17:09.520 --> 17:14.360]  most busy stretch of highway in the country they say it was like Jesus Christ
[17:14.360 --> 17:17.920]  had returned or something and we went and covered his funeral and I'm Shadi's
[17:17.920 --> 17:23.360]  dead and you know I do think the guy was obviously a brave person but I just
[17:23.360 --> 17:27.400]  so over the top this is the kind of stuff you see in North Korea when you
[17:27.400 --> 17:32.400]  have this type of martial ceremony but this cop didn't die going in to free
[17:32.400 --> 17:36.600]  women and children who had a kidnapper with them who then got killed trying to
[17:36.600 --> 17:41.360]  stop them then you shut down the highway then you I think citizens would want to
[17:41.360 --> 17:44.920]  come out and line the road for an example of a citizen that did a good job I
[17:44.920 --> 17:48.840]  got a couple examples here a preacher is going in dollar stores and thieves or
[17:48.840 --> 17:52.520]  pistol whipping women and then the preacher takes them out you know does
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.120]  that guy get any type of parade I think he should get a parade to I think when
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.160]  firefighters go into a burning building and shave kids and then it collapses when
[18:00.160 --> 18:03.320]  they go back in to save more I think you I think you need a parade for that
[18:03.320 --> 18:09.680]  that's where this comes from you get a parade for for being a hero but now
[18:09.680 --> 18:13.960]  there's just the idea of you get a parade because you are a cop and that
[18:13.960 --> 18:19.040]  makes you the highest level hero I mean why not give everybody in the army the
[18:19.040 --> 18:24.360]  Congressional Medal of Honor not just give it to Audie Murphy I don't think
[18:24.360 --> 18:27.440]  Audie Murphy in fact I was looking it up this morning couldn't find anything on
[18:27.440 --> 18:32.600]  it I don't think he got a parade like this and the guy at one setting killed
[18:32.600 --> 18:38.280]  like 55 German soldiers in a battle in Germany and he'd already been in a whole
[18:38.280 --> 18:43.400]  bunch of stuff just like that on top of tank destroyer for an hour with the
[18:43.400 --> 18:47.600]  tank destroyer on fire with his feet burning with bullets and his hip and
[18:47.600 --> 18:51.080]  chest and everything else because he didn't like his buddies getting killed I
[18:51.080 --> 18:55.800]  mean Audie Murphy did not get what this cop got and I mean that's all I'm
[18:55.800 --> 18:59.720]  saying I just I just don't get I'm sad he's dead my god every time my wife
[18:59.720 --> 19:03.440]  drives off of my kids especially when it's raining I say drive slow hydro
[19:03.440 --> 19:07.280]  planning super dangerous I felt bad when I drove by when I saw that cops car
[19:07.280 --> 19:11.760]  t-boned I just like it was a citizen I thought man I hope I hope that person's
[19:11.760 --> 19:16.720]  alright but then I went wait a minute they ran our nanny off the road and
[19:16.720 --> 19:20.520]  three other cars and the cops got in their face when they showed up making
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.040]  excuses for it cops without their lights on they said I think she said like six
[19:25.040 --> 19:29.920]  of them drove down the median on 290 cut in front of the car in front of her
[19:29.920 --> 19:36.080]  almost hitting them and then ran those cars off the road and there was a big
[19:36.080 --> 19:40.720]  car pile up and it's like oh you're just a peasant big deal well you know what
[19:40.720 --> 19:45.440]  that wreck was driving gets people killed doesn't it so my point is the very
[19:45.440 --> 19:48.720]  spot where they ran our nanny off the road this guy's dead and then a week
[19:48.720 --> 19:52.840]  later they got the whole road shut down like Caesar got killed and I just it
[19:52.840 --> 19:56.600]  doesn't make sense is all I'm saying all right we're gonna be right back but

[24:15.600 --> 24:29.280]  all right we're back folks I want to open the phones up for listeners to talk
[24:29.280 --> 24:32.880]  about all the different things that are happening out there the government
[24:32.880 --> 24:36.840]  shut down what a fraud that was what happened with the debt increase what's
[24:36.840 --> 24:41.920]  happening to the dollar we wake up and the national debt's gone up a trillion
[24:41.920 --> 24:45.880]  dollars now they're talking about making it go up a trillion dollars a month I've
[24:45.880 --> 24:50.720]  got those headlines here now that they've got an unlimited debt increase at
[24:50.720 --> 24:56.040]  least in the next year that's the name of the game scuttle the United States
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.920]  wreck it so the venture capitalist the vulture capitalist who are anti free
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.640]  market can come in and pick its bones I mean it's so simple these are ruthless
[25:05.640 --> 25:10.300]  people and if we'll allow them to engage in all these crimes we're going to be up
[25:10.300 --> 25:16.560]  the creek without a paddle as they say and again the police are so paramilitary
[25:16.560 --> 25:23.080]  now that just ten years ago the police officers I knew in Austin Texas were
[25:23.080 --> 25:27.240]  different than they are now and a cop by himself will be one of the nicest people
[25:27.240 --> 25:31.040]  you can talk to sitting around watching a football game or going fishing with or
[25:31.040 --> 25:34.160]  hunting with believe me I've gone hunting and fishing with plenty of cops in my
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.600]  life got a lot of them that are family but you get them in their mob psychology
[25:38.600 --> 25:44.120]  groups they are dangerous more and more an arrogant and imperious and that's
[25:44.120 --> 25:49.400]  anti-american and it's shameful and there's this idea that our public
[25:49.400 --> 25:54.200]  servants can be armed but we the so-called masters can't be well we're
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.120]  not really the masters we are civilians we are slaves they are the
[25:58.120 --> 26:02.440]  paramilitary group that rules the country and I've known this since I read
[26:02.440 --> 26:07.440]  ran corporation documents back in the 90s and since I read those documents and
[26:07.440 --> 26:12.240]  went to urban warfare drills and also was warned by good police officers and
[26:12.240 --> 26:18.120]  good military men who knew that this was part of a covert long-term strategy to
[26:18.120 --> 26:23.880]  convert our country from a free due process nation to a banana republic
[26:23.880 --> 26:30.040]  there is almost nowhere in the world except for the United States Switzerland
[26:30.040 --> 26:33.240]  and a couple other countries where you can really somewhat outright on your
[26:33.240 --> 26:37.920]  property and not just have government come along and take it and now they're
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.840]  starting to do that here with environmental imminent domain corporate
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.560]  imminent domain where they don't even pay you five cents on the dollar what
[26:46.560 --> 26:49.760]  your property is worth you can have the tax receipts of what you pay in
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.000]  property tax and they say sorry the city has ruled and you've seen all these
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.840]  in New Haven Connecticut cases and the rest of it we've had famous cases like
[26:58.840 --> 27:04.120]  Gorsi food on the Texas coast where they just take your property and say you
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.320]  know what we're going to give you we're going to give you nothing how's that
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.000]  sound and you go but my house is worth $500,000 the tax receipts shows
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.200]  doesn't matter we're just taking it and if you fight us we're going to charge you
[27:17.200 --> 27:25.400]  for our lawyer fees in the court battle Texas landowners it's the Texas Bill of
[27:25.400 --> 27:29.240]  Rights Landor Bill of Rights the Bill of Rights they passed a few years ago I
[27:29.240 --> 27:33.200]  guess six years ago in the State House actually says they can tell you now
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.920]  they're going to put a pipeline on your property or drill on your property or do
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.240]  whatever they want on your property or build a road on your property and you
[27:40.240 --> 27:44.480]  have no right to refuse you get like six months to agree with them and if you
[27:44.480 --> 27:51.200]  don't they just take it it's kind of like the Don Corleone Godfather thing
[27:51.200 --> 27:54.640]  where either your brains or your signature are going to be on this
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.920]  contract well we're going to take your property if you don't give it to us and
[27:59.920 --> 28:05.080]  my point is by every yardstick and no sociologist no anthropologist no
[28:05.080 --> 28:09.880]  historian denies this they have Wall Street Journal articles CNN even admits
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.480]  it we are now a police state and a police state has not really much to do
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.280]  with the cops themselves but with the due process being in the toilet I mean
[28:20.280 --> 28:23.200]  you're in a police state where they can take your kids for not taking vaccines
[28:23.200 --> 28:27.240]  and there's no loss and you got to take vaccines you're in a police state where
[28:27.240 --> 28:30.120]  people are afraid to come to Texas I know because they see all the news
[28:30.120 --> 28:32.680]  articles about the cops will pull you over and you got a thousand dollars in
[28:32.680 --> 28:39.520]  your wallet they'll just take it and say it's drug money with no proof America is
[28:39.520 --> 28:46.000]  becoming like Mexico or like an African country or like a corrupt Caribbean
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.600]  nation and I don't want to live in police I don't want to live in Nigeria I
[28:50.600 --> 28:56.720]  don't want to live in Saudi Arabia I want to live in the United States and so I
[28:56.720 --> 29:01.040]  read the Homeland Security documents that are public and it says I'm bad well
[29:01.040 --> 29:04.280]  of course I'm bad I'm against the criminal takeover I'm against a bank
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.040]  robbery of our rights and our liberties and our money and I'm legitimately
[29:09.040 --> 29:13.280]  freaked out when I try to talk to cops I didn't stop and talk to cops where I
[29:13.280 --> 29:17.120]  was rolling through there was so many cops shutting this road down or getting
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.960]  ready to shut it down that repeatedly I would roll and stop in traffic right
[29:21.960 --> 29:26.600]  where a cop was that's how many there were and would try to talk to them and
[29:26.600 --> 29:32.040]  was treated worse than Mexican cops have treated my family when I've been down
[29:32.040 --> 29:37.640]  there with them and I won't go to Mexico because of the Mexican cops and I love
[29:37.640 --> 29:41.200]  Mexico it's a beautiful country a lot of neat stuff I will no longer go there
[29:41.200 --> 29:44.920]  because it's too dangerous the police are too corrupt see but see I can't go I
[29:44.920 --> 29:48.840]  can't leave Texas I don't want the cops to turn into that the big news is coming

[35:15.720 --> 35:21.160]  developing here's a story up on drudge report dot com in the middle column it's
[35:21.160 --> 35:26.680]  also up on info works dot com homeland security spends eighty million on arm
[35:26.680 --> 35:35.400]  guards for civil disturbances irs buildings to be protected what is the
[35:35.400 --> 35:38.760]  federal government preparing for Paul Watson asked this is from the federal
[35:38.760 --> 35:43.160]  business opportunities website the same place we learned about two million
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.000]  dollars for paper targets of children were they trained to shoot small children
[35:47.000 --> 35:57.440]  called no more hesitation continuing here irs buildings be protected the
[35:57.440 --> 36:00.400]  Department of Homeland Security is set to spend eighty million dollars on
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.480]  hiring a raft of armed guards to protect irs at other government buildings in
[36:04.480 --> 36:08.920]  upstate new york during public demonstrations that's just in new york
[36:08.920 --> 36:13.160]  state folks that's just one of these contracts and civil disturbances these
[36:13.160 --> 36:17.320]  are quotes once again prompting concerns that the federal agency is
[36:17.320 --> 36:22.160]  preparing for food stamp riots anti-tax demonstrations or some other form of
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.400]  domestic unrest yeah they're cutting the food stamps massively coming up in just
[36:28.400 --> 36:34.000]  a few months fact it kicks in the cuts kick in actually next month time is just
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.120]  flying in the middle of november and notice there's nothing to do with the
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.080]  government shut down any of it they are now getting ready to cut start cutting
[36:41.080 --> 36:46.240]  the quote social safety net because they've already domesticated you they've
[36:46.240 --> 36:49.720]  already fattened you up they've already gotten you where you don't know how to
[36:49.720 --> 36:52.720]  work they've already shut down the jobs they've already shipped them to china
[36:52.720 --> 36:56.440]  general motors has left Detroit has collapsed they've already brought in the
[36:56.440 --> 37:00.720]  illegals has robbed down the wages and everything's being maneuvered now for
[37:00.720 --> 37:05.840]  huge cuts to welfare food stamps you name it because the country is bankrupt
[37:05.840 --> 37:10.720]  but don't worry it's not going to be allowed to pay off its debts because we've
[37:10.720 --> 37:15.920]  been signed on to debts that aren't ours in the derivatives the bankers though
[37:15.920 --> 37:20.520]  just now want to create the social explosions so homeland security and the
[37:20.520 --> 37:25.160]  armored vehicles and the checkpoints and the emergency centers can all be
[37:25.160 --> 37:30.160]  tested out and whether it's this year next year or two years down the road we
[37:30.160 --> 37:37.960]  are entering into a designed collapse and the areas like chicago new york dc
[37:37.960 --> 37:42.520]  where they've taken all the guns are going to see unbelievable social unrest
[37:42.520 --> 37:47.240]  under this it's already going on the crime is already exploding and all the
[37:47.240 --> 37:52.720]  globalist held territories and they hope to disarm everybody but at least they
[37:52.720 --> 37:57.000]  can get the industrialized to shut our power plants off shut down our jobs raise
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.440]  the taxes pass the health care to bankrupt the health care industry this
[38:01.440 --> 38:04.960]  is all meant to destroy areas they don't control remember the globalist are
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.400]  exempt from everything the taxes the regulations they have diplomatic
[38:09.400 --> 38:14.720]  community these big hedge funds managers have you in diplomatic community the UN
[38:14.720 --> 38:17.400]  people are diplomatic community there's hundreds of thousands of diplomatic
[38:17.400 --> 38:21.720]  community they're now extending a kind of diplomatic community light to
[38:21.720 --> 38:26.960]  paramilitaries to police to others this is their criminal time this is their
[38:26.960 --> 38:34.040]  total takeover and it's it's going to be hellish that's all I can say now we may
[38:34.040 --> 38:40.440]  be able to get the word out and they may back off though at least partially the
[38:40.440 --> 38:46.200]  problem is the globalist have already committed this doomsday machine is what
[38:46.200 --> 38:51.640]  I'd call this perpetual chaos machine has has has been so committed now so
[38:51.640 --> 38:56.840]  rolled out so implemented that there's no putting it back in the box but they
[38:56.840 --> 39:00.360]  could scale it back they could curtail it and the and I would advise the
[39:00.360 --> 39:06.120]  globalist to do that it isn't hype every one of our sources from Ron Paul to
[39:06.120 --> 39:11.800]  Stuart Rhodes to myself the countless others who make contact with the
[39:11.800 --> 39:17.720]  military active duty and recently retired but also long-term retired say
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.240]  that just a couple years ago it was 40 50 percent of the overall military was
[39:23.240 --> 39:29.720]  away now it's 50 percent of enlisted newly enlisted probably 60 70 percent of
[39:29.720 --> 39:37.360]  longtime enlisted and 70 to 85 percent of special warfare Psyops is more like
[39:37.360 --> 39:43.640]  85 percent because imagine you're in Psyops and all the old Psyops were to
[39:43.640 --> 39:50.040]  discredit tyranny discredit communism discredit collectivism discredit
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.760]  North Korea discredit Russia because those were tyrannies and enemies now
[39:54.760 --> 39:58.320]  they get their manuals and it's discredit the family discredit local
[39:58.320 --> 40:01.840]  government discredit gun owners discredit veterans and I mean we have these
[40:01.840 --> 40:05.280]  manuals they've been leaked to a summer public and imagine you're sitting around
[40:05.280 --> 40:09.760]  in Psyops going okay we're now exposed to engage in domestic operations and our
[40:09.760 --> 40:18.000]  target is the American people and they still have the window dressing of well
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.320]  we're doing IED training and Kim bio training NBC training in case Al Qaeda
[40:23.320 --> 40:27.400]  hits that that was always the public facade of the military rollout and to
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.440]  get the military to go along with it with the EOD teams ordinance disposal
[40:31.440 --> 40:37.000]  but there was always going back even to Reagan in 1987 when this first started I
[40:37.000 --> 40:43.080]  talked to a Marine Corps major who retired early out of the Marines from
[40:43.080 --> 40:49.040]  Space Command and total black government total shadow government and he
[40:49.040 --> 40:52.600]  started a successful computer company and stuff and he was so mad running into
[40:52.600 --> 40:59.800]  an army checkpoint this is like 12 years ago for 9-11 on I-35 and Kyle and he'd
[40:59.800 --> 41:03.880]  been a a Marine got out of that then he'd been a cop for a while didn't like
[41:03.880 --> 41:07.320]  that and then went started a computer company and I visited him in his nice
[41:07.320 --> 41:12.280]  house with his wife and family he only showed me the unclassified stuff but him
[41:12.280 --> 41:17.640]  in Space Command and all the rest of it and he wrote up to this army checkpoint
[41:17.640 --> 41:22.080]  wanting to search people this is in actually in the film in game or not in
[41:22.080 --> 41:27.800]  game of road to tyranny the short excerpt the full interviews online and he
[41:27.800 --> 41:30.520]  said the army you wanted you're searching people is this is is there a
[41:30.520 --> 41:35.720]  threat they go no it's just a drill and and he knew what it was and he had been
[41:35.720 --> 41:43.040]  on SWAT team rage when he was just a Marine Corps sergeant he had been on
[41:43.040 --> 41:48.000]  SWAT team rage or maybe it was a I forget the point was he'd been on SWAT
[41:48.000 --> 41:57.600]  team rage of gun dealers homes full with the ATF in Virginia and and that was in
[41:57.600 --> 42:01.960]  the late 80s and because he participated in shadow government operations they
[42:01.960 --> 42:05.480]  kicked him up to a higher rank and he went to Space Command he wouldn't tell
[42:05.480 --> 42:09.240]  me about that but he said oh yeah it's pretty incredible and of course I already
[42:09.240 --> 42:12.760]  know from dr. Bob Bowman former head of Star Wars what they have I mean they've
[42:12.760 --> 42:18.740]  just got fleets of robot little like stealth bombers and orbit with all
[42:18.740 --> 42:22.560]  sorts of weapons I mean that's that's why the globalists are so arrogant is my
[42:22.560 --> 42:30.120]  point and I don't know why I just digressed off into that my point is is
[42:30.120 --> 42:33.800]  that it's aimed at us it's always been aimed at us they've always been training
[42:33.800 --> 42:39.360]  to take us on I've been to Marine Corps drills where they actually let me in and
[42:39.360 --> 42:43.880]  then the Colonel love saw me there Colonel love was his name and freaked out
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.480]  and they had me thrown out but we had other citizen tours they were giving
[42:48.480 --> 42:52.920]  in the California Oakland takeover and so that's how we got the footage of them
[42:52.920 --> 42:57.440]  training to take Americans guns door-to-door and then execute militia
[42:57.440 --> 43:02.200]  leaders I mean what do you think the Marines really do in Fallujah and in
[43:02.200 --> 43:05.200]  Iraq or what do you think they really did when they were fighting the Taliban
[43:05.200 --> 43:11.000]  going into villages they kill everyone just war crime up one side and down the
[43:11.000 --> 43:20.800]  other and the Colonel the generals were on the ship on the Coronado but the
[43:20.800 --> 43:24.440]  Colonel was in charge of the of the ground landing with troops from eight
[43:24.440 --> 43:30.080]  different nations training to fight the American people and we later learned the
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.280]  drill was for a North Carolina or Georgia type invasion of the South which we
[43:35.280 --> 43:38.760]  now know that they've been drilling for for 20 years where they think they may
[43:38.760 --> 43:42.720]  get resistance to gun confiscation and it didn't matter we got the footage we've
[43:42.720 --> 43:48.280]  got the footage of what you're planning that was 1999 Operation Urban Warrior
[43:48.280 --> 43:56.200]  1999 its symbol was a dragon coming out of the ocean and attacking a US city
[43:56.200 --> 44:00.760]  they even got a patch for the mission it's type in Operation Urban Warrior
[44:00.760 --> 44:04.760]  1999 it's a big green dragon you guys can find it and imagine I'm just a
[44:04.760 --> 44:09.240]  regular guy I want to warn people so I get on the air and I start saying okay
[44:09.240 --> 44:15.480]  here's the footage okay if this is going on and then the Marines reportedly
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.840]  along with other government people call the home corporate office of Shamrock
[44:19.840 --> 44:25.600]  Communications there was I think I'm like Scranton, Ohio and they fly out and
[44:25.600 --> 44:28.840]  they go you're not to talk about about the Marines anymore you're not to talk
[44:28.840 --> 44:32.840]  about about the government anymore or Waco anymore or Bill Clinton anymore or
[44:32.840 --> 44:37.640]  you're fired and I said well I can't so a while later they fired me they gave me
[44:37.640 --> 44:41.080]  like nine weeks to quit and kept saying we're gonna fire you we're gonna fire you
[44:41.080 --> 44:46.440]  we're gonna fire you I mean I've had the Marines have me kicked off the radio in
[44:46.440 --> 44:51.560]  America okay I mean they've been si-hopping and operating domestically
[44:51.560 --> 44:55.280]  since medley Butler's time and he blew the whistle on that a plan to use the
[44:55.280 --> 44:59.480]  Marines for a military coup and to bring in fascism and that got stopped in the
[44:59.480 --> 45:03.280]  30s and we're going to stop it again ladies and gentlemen so the average
[45:03.280 --> 45:08.720]  Marine is a great person the average Army soldiers a great person I know they
[45:08.720 --> 45:12.760]  try to teach them in briefings that I'm anti-Marine or I'm anti-army and that
[45:12.760 --> 45:16.880]  actually has backfired on them in fact I finally reversed engineered that I'm
[45:16.880 --> 45:23.120]  going to your phone calls why our show originally got so popular one of the
[45:23.120 --> 45:28.840]  biggest things was this a it was accurate a you'll be it was original but
[45:28.840 --> 45:33.040]  see and most importantly we had Patriot supporters out there that knew we were
[45:33.040 --> 45:40.160]  being hardcore about the truth and and and we're telling the truth ABCD but
[45:40.160 --> 45:49.440]  but but D's very important as well they did by the late 90s briefings in the
[45:49.440 --> 45:54.480]  Army and the Marines and the Air Force and then later even other sub-services
[45:54.480 --> 46:00.600]  where they would find one of my films are recording on cassette or CD or
[46:00.600 --> 46:05.360]  whatever and they would call everyone in and say this man is an enemy this man
[46:05.360 --> 46:10.320]  is a liar this man is dangerous he tells a kernel of the truth don't listen to
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.360]  him he's anti-American what do you think everybody did when they heard that they
[46:16.360 --> 46:21.400]  all went to because we used to see the traffic coming in and going half the
[46:21.400 --> 46:25.360]  visits to our website of the military and and the government and it wasn't the
[46:25.360 --> 46:30.280]  government even spying on us I'm sure a small percentage of it was that it was
[46:30.280 --> 46:36.200]  the military listening because they were been told don't listen to this and now I
[46:36.200 --> 46:41.120]  can tell you without a shadow of a doubt we are the number one show in the
[46:41.120 --> 46:46.640]  military the number one show that they're listening to and they know I don't
[46:46.640 --> 46:49.440]  have all the answers and I don't know everything I'm just a regular guy like
[46:49.440 --> 46:53.400]  they are but they can go see everything I'm telling him is in their manuals they
[46:53.400 --> 46:56.400]  know everything I'm talking about is accurate they can have a different take
[46:56.400 --> 46:59.880]  on a different perspective but I'm just telling the truth here folks I just
[46:59.880 --> 47:04.360]  witnessed Marines training to take our guns and saying it was for America and
[47:04.360 --> 47:08.520]  it's my patriotic duty to go out and warn people the rest is up to you it
[47:08.520 --> 47:14.160]  isn't about Alex Jones but let me go over this news Homeland Security spends
[47:14.160 --> 47:22.120]  80 million on armed guards for civil disturbances just in New York alone
[47:25.000 --> 47:28.880]  coordinates solicitation posted on federal business opportunities website the
[47:28.880 --> 47:34.720]  federal protective services the unit of the DHS is looking for a contractor's
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.640]  apply armed protective security guards to guard a variety of government
[47:38.640 --> 47:43.360]  buildings in the region including IRS buildings during tax season yeah when
[47:43.360 --> 47:48.040]  you get that five thousand dollar fee three to five thousand dollar fee well
[47:48.040 --> 47:51.760]  I guess it's a household it's more than five thousand they think you're gonna get
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.040]  mad now I've told you whenever they have any type of demonstrations going on they
[47:56.040 --> 47:59.600]  park armored vehicles in front of the entrances of the IRS here in Austin I
[47:59.600 --> 48:03.640]  mean because they are an occupying army that works for offshore banks I mean the
[48:03.640 --> 48:07.560]  offshore bankers know they're involved in a criminal takeover of America do you
[48:07.560 --> 48:12.360]  think they they're arming to the teeth against this of course they are and now
[48:12.360 --> 48:17.760]  I know for a fact that the senior people at the IRS here in Austin the biggest
[48:17.760 --> 48:21.840]  IRS center in the country it's like for five states I know for a fact they're
[48:21.840 --> 48:25.600]  listing and know it's true and now know that all the big rich guys are exempt and
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.520]  they really feel bad the IRS used to think taking all ladies houses on average
[48:29.520 --> 48:32.680]  was really to run the country and stuff now they know it's all the way to
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.520]  destroy America the power to tax the power destroy they have the lowest morale
[48:36.520 --> 48:39.880]  ever they're trying to get rid of people entirely go right to computers and
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.520]  digital stuff to just grab the money out of your account they're not even gonna
[48:43.520 --> 48:47.600]  go through some IRS court thing now they're just gonna take your money just
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.720]  like Cyprus and the IRS folks have been told they've already laid off half of
[48:52.720 --> 48:56.040]  them who thought they were seasonal they're told you're never coming back
[48:56.040 --> 48:59.920]  and now the word is from a very high level source within three years you're
[48:59.920 --> 49:03.760]  gonna have 10% of the people at the IRS you did so they're not gonna have jobs
[49:03.760 --> 49:07.480]  either see how this works it's all gonna be automated but you think they
[49:07.480 --> 49:10.800]  ship everything to India because they like Indians that's the cheapest humans
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.000]  they can find is in India as many people in India now as there is in China even
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.800]  poorer and smart you think you can compete with them just as smart as you
[49:20.800 --> 49:26.520]  are smarter living in the street by day or by night and working in the building
[49:26.520 --> 49:31.560]  by day a lot of Indians are happy just to go in and work all day at a computer
[49:31.560 --> 49:34.880]  center because they go and you know eight nine people live in a one-room deal
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.600]  with no windows and it might be lucky they get one meal a day so they like to
[49:39.600 --> 49:43.120]  sleep at their desk think you can compete with that well guess what soon
[49:43.120 --> 49:47.000]  you won't even be competing with them soon you'll be competing with computers
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.680]  that just take it out of your bank account and that's what the whole NSA
[49:50.680 --> 49:54.640]  Obamacare the Obamacare computers interface with a know your customer
[49:54.640 --> 49:59.400]  are gonna take everything out of your bank account and even when you pay with
[49:59.400 --> 50:02.160]  cash you're gonna have to show your driver's license and to be putting a
[50:02.160 --> 50:06.400]  database on you to see if you quote have been doing any underground economy
[50:06.400 --> 50:09.360]  trying to survive and then they're gonna come and they're gonna arrest you
[50:09.360 --> 50:13.800]  they're gonna send a paramilitary team stacked up 10 deep at your house and if
[50:13.800 --> 50:18.440]  you resist they're gonna kill you so this is the design destruction of America
[50:18.440 --> 50:23.640]  now the military and the police can wake up say no speak out or you can sign
[50:23.640 --> 50:28.560]  your own death warrant politically and economically and spiritually and go

[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:32.640]  how the MTV and the BET hip-hop gangster culture took over our country and I've
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.360]  heard a lot of people calling to your show Alex but I've never heard I mean I
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:42.800]  heard freeway Ricky Ross which has not similar because he's like way big time
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.480]  but he experienced some of the same things that I experienced and I'm a white
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.480]  male I'm a white American male by the way that's not Rick Ross the big fat
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.040]  hippopotamus guy that's the real freeway Ricky Ross Ricky Ross the guy that was
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.600]  dealing drugs for the CIA yes I heard him on your show but I've never heard any
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:06.400]  real like gangster types from our public I've heard famous guys like rappers and
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.680]  stuff on your show but I've never heard actual citizens call it and say yeah
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:15.160]  you're telling the truth I grew up in a bad neighborhood in southern Florida I
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.880]  grew up in an all-black neighborhood and my mother's were three jobs and she had
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.920]  cancer for about ten years I'm sorry and she was alone and my dad was on the
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:29.640]  other side of the country they split up and I had no father so I adopted the
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:33.720]  MTV gangster culture in the hip-hop culture and that's what was going on in
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.440]  my neighborhood and I grew up during like 94 which the gang intensity was
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:43.440]  really hot so I got involved with the role in 60s the blood gang so you were
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:49.240]  slinging rock huh I wasn't slinging rock but I was carrying I was packing heat at
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:53.440]  14 years old I had a 380 in my waist all the time I had a 12-gauge shotgun in my
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:58.360]  bed I was running scared from the police running scared from everybody and I was
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.840]  just a young stupid kid that didn't have no no direction from a father my
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.600]  mother was working all the time and I what it really was I had no love so I
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.040]  went and I looked for love in other places and and I'll tell everybody right
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.400]  now listening to the show Alex Jones is absolutely correct I come from a
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.660]  generation that grew up on this hip-hop gangster culture and the music the
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:26.000]  movies the films all of it hypnotizes you it brain washes you into thinking
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  that that's what you need to do you've got young males that are looking for a
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.280]  male role model and young women are looking for it and they tell you it's
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.120]  some giant fat person with gold hang around their neck calling women hoes and
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.680]  it's on record I've talked to people at MTV that were high level they said
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.760]  even better than rock and roll Satanism to destroy young people we're gonna go
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.240]  with this gangster culture to get them all ready for prison it's all financed

[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.280]  up there it's a newsmaker because he's not on any other TV interviews in a long
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:12.480]  time he does text interviews he says Obamacare is unfixable as a top
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.320]  programmer he says scrap it by the way coming up on the nightly news we're
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:23.600]  gonna have more interviews out shooting with John McAvie and then tomorrow night

[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:36.240]  that is coming up and yes I was firing the 50s handheld and didn't think it had
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.800]  much of a kick until I woke up this morning I really have blown some muscles
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.320]  out my back so that's coming up and we're gonna have special in-studio

[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:05.680]  pamphlet just the synopsis that's like 40 pages not the actual reactions because
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.560]  that's several thousand pages if you index the top 20 vaccines or so so not I
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:15.200]  don't want the multi-thousand pages of death cancer Guillain berets narcolepsy
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:25.840]  permanent epilepsy all sorts of other disorders autoimmune disorders miscarriages
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.440]  we're just gonna go over some of the stuff because they say they're safe and
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.440]  effective there are no side effects anyone that says it is a liar so I
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.120]  thought we would actually have some of these idiots in here and their idiots
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.800]  and I'm calling them idiots out there in the control room get them all riled up
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.440]  the scum we're gonna have them in here to tell us how great all this is the
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.240]  bottom of the hour but right now some of the other headlines this is big homeland
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:58.520]  security spends 80 million on armed guards for civil disturbances and where's
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:03.760]  that from that's from the federal business website federal business opportunities
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.240]  website remember last year you learned at info wars.com just because we're
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.120]  actual journalists and dig through the news articles nothing nothing special
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:18.440]  about me or my crew that we are special they're hard-working and smart we go
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.920]  through there and find out about how they're the Pentagon's buying up civilian
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.400]  guns so we can't get them under Obama's orders or how they bought two and a half
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.640]  billion rounds of ammo now or how they're buying thousands of armored
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.300]  vehicles a month to give them to police to battle the American people or how
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.080]  they're buying two million dollars of paper targets of children for no
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:39.760]  hesitation to train to kill children or how the new Army manual says the
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.520]  founding fathers of the enemy you know and wouldn't be accepted in the US
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.640]  military and Forbes and AP report the Pentagon's main mission is to battle
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.560]  American libertarians because we're the only Americans left of course a foreign
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:57.040]  takeover says we the good guys are the bad guys this is the Sovietization like
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.960]  we're Poland taken over by Russia but it in Poland it's a global corporates group
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.080]  that's almost impossible to actually pin down or stop because it's a bunch of
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.040]  interlocking multinational corporations bigger GDPs together than four or five
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:18.160]  top nations combined of the fortune of the top 100 GDPs in the world more than
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.960]  50 or corporations now just to give you an idea you can look that up I think it
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.520]  was like 12 years ago we crossed the Rubicon where more than 50% of the top
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.880]  100 economies are corporations not countries and they're above the law and
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.920]  they write the laws and they write the rules and they don't want you to be in
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.840]  business and they don't want you to use cash and they don't want you to go to
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.760]  the farmers market and they don't want you to go to a local business and they
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.960]  don't and so it's our job as much as we can to not traffic with big
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:54.080]  establishment corporations and businesses whenever I went to England to
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:58.320]  cover Bilderberg and I'm going to your calls this year a few months ago I had
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:05.600]  an MI5 group of people show up and were waiting for me downstairs and they only
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:09.000]  made themselves know when I was alone it just came up and gave me some intel
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.680]  that turned out to be accurate and then the local police head liaison for the
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.920]  county and all the other departments met with me and had dinner and he's very
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.200]  professional and in fact he didn't eat he had a he had a coca-cola and he said
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.760]  I'm really surprised you're staying at a corporate hotel I wouldn't be doing
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.320]  that I'd be staying in a mom-and-pop you're a hypocrite I said listen we
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.360]  don't always do everything perfectly this is all we could get for enough rooms
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.200]  for all of my crew we tried local mom-and-pops he goes okay I see your
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:44.200]  point but he was actually right and what was funny is when I ran to the MI5
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:48.080]  people they said the same thing and they weren't just putting me on they were
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:54.640]  genuinely pissed off at the system and I was telling police well you know your
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.720]  cancer rates have more than tripled and here's a London independent article that
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:04.960]  was laying there in the hotel you know free every day saying that by 2020 half
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.360]  of Brits will have cancer and they said we know we know about the health
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:14.200]  service I don't need to be told about it my mother just died and then we had one
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:19.760]  listener who was out there remember who was walking by the Grove grounds where
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.840]  the golf course in the hotel are past a private citizens home in the semi-rural
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:30.360]  area it's like suburb into rule and that's my favorite type of place like
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.160]  where it's rural but also it's like still got some sitting in it and the guy
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.520]  goes no you can come here you're my guest police don't harass him and the
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.520]  guy's like get away from me my wife just died in your national health service
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.480]  waiting for care first yeah I mean they're mad folks they get the
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.400]  government's out to screw them and we have to get that same attitude and
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:56.240]  understand it is a corporate globalist government that is absolutely out to get
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.800]  us and we've got to shop with local businesses we've got to support local
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.000]  restaurants we've got to support local factories we've got to support the local
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.160]  lumberyard even if their service isn't as good and even if it costs a little
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.160]  more because they don't have everything rigged and even if their you know
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.920]  alcoholic son is out back giving you the wood and is rude to you if you don't
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.800]  support those local people it's over folks because the globalist want to shut
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.640]  this economy down I'm done ranting
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:30.920]  Interpol chief armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks wow Interpol
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:36.280]  chief Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble told ABC news that one of the ways
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.480]  to prevent terrorists from hitting soft targets was to armed citizens globally
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.720]  noting that the Westgate mall siege would have been averted far quicker if it
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.120]  had taken place in gun friendly states like Denver or Texas I wonder how long
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:56.240]  this guy's gonna be that Interpol not very quick common sense man I thought
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:00.720]  that he's canned in them three months they're gonna start looking for reasons
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.680]  like Ted Cruz I get these I see these comments and emails why aren't you
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.320]  covering Ted Cruz and his corruption and then stuff in the Bahamas oh I'm sorry
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:12.960]  decades ago his college buddy started a business and asked all his friends to
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.240]  invest that's what you do to help each other he invested six thousand and had
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.000]  forgotten about on his financial foldings you think some lawyer that's you
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.560]  know makes half a million dollars a year as a top lawyer remembers some
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:28.040]  investment he made with a college buddy for six thousand dollars this is the
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:33.680]  dirtiness of him being on some board with his college buddy compared to like
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:37.760]  Diane Feinstein who went to Congress with him less than a million dollars and
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:43.600]  is now worth a hundred million and who gives deals and biotech to her husband
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.400]  worth billions who's worth bill I mean no oh forget all that forget I mean it's
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.360]  like if you talk about Liberty they say you're a racist with no proof Southern
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.200]  probably lost their MSNBC but if you actually say I admire Hitler I want to
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:02.600]  be a dictator black people aren't humans I always admire the Hitler then you get
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.640]  ADL Southern Property Law Center award see you have to dress in a Nazi uniform
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.680]  your father has to be an SS officer yet to be best friends with the former top
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.440]  SS officer Kirk Voltaim who killed US soldiers who were caught behind enemy
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.880]  lines in Serbia if you're an actual purebred SS product marriage his brother
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.920]  was older than him actually born in World War two Arnold was born after World
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.160]  War two the product of an SS breeding campaign if you're the product of an
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.800]  SS breeding campaign then you get an ADL award I'm serious he's got my highest
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.400]  awards if you stand against Nazism you're attacked now that's that's up
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.040]  upside down isn't it that's how it works so they'll be digging around in the
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.840]  Interpol chiefs dossier to find something now maybe as a crooked toenail or
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:53.440]  something let's go ahead and talk to Al commonsense rears its head Peter in
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:58.160]  Washington you're on the air extremist thank you for calling in hello Alex you
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:05.800]  can hear me yes sir I can okay I just want to talk about one of the issues
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:12.400]  that you had brought up in the on the Middle East and you know going back to
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.320]  the history of the intelligence services operating with the fanatics I
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:27.720]  think the basis of it was the wipeout of a British command post at cartoon by a
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:36.440]  charismatic figure called a mochi and his followers but what I wanted to bring
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:46.440]  out is that it wasn't all cynicism that I think there was some conversion going
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:53.040]  on years ago I read a novel by Kipling called the light that failed about a
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:59.680]  artist that lost his sight well I saw the movie and then I I read the book and
[01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:05.680]  the book this was kind of you know suggested that this sort of thing was
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:11.440]  happening and what reminded me brought it back to me is I picked up an old book
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:18.240]  by John Buchan who wrote the famous spy thriller the 39 steps this book was
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:24.920]  printed in 1916 called green mantle and the plot was that the Kaiser was going
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:31.120]  to set something like this up you know to drive the British out of out of
[01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:37.640]  Turkey and I know those are novels but both of those people were well not sure
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.360]  so bottom line what are you saying about World War one what are you saying
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:45.760]  about the Muslims I'm saying that some of these people in British intelligence
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:51.680]  were converts now as to Lawrence of Arabia I don't know it oh yeah well we
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.200]  know a bunch of masons it became Muslims as well and didn't Napoleon oh sure a
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.360]  lot of folks do end up converting to Islam and that is true we'll be right
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:04.360]  back Alex Jones here and I want to tell you about a long time friend of the show

[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.200]  the good responses but I gotta tell you there isn't a day that goes by I'm not
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.400]  called a racist I don't do bad and for new listeners that you join us and
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.160]  weren't here when you called in last week you have a bicycle hook to a two
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:14.160]  sided big plasma screen TV with audio speakers playing my show my videos my
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.600]  films and you go around and you said you get very positive stuff from the
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.080]  military and others now you were saying overwhelmingly positive but you're
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:25.160]  saying some of it's negative and yes any criticism if you say Obamacare is a
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.880]  scam because it is a scam you're a racist if you say you don't want to give
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.400]  your kids vaccines you're a racist my wife was told by family now not all our
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.120]  families like this they're great folks but some of our distant family that
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.280]  Christianity is inherently racist and she said well how is it racist you mean
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.880]  you could say it's bigoted or you don't agree with it no no no hobby lobby is
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.200]  racist because they're not open on Sundays so it's literally a weapon that
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.920]  these people use because they don't have any intellectual argument it's a cult of
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:58.400]  authoritarians calling themselves liberal and so briefly tell us what
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:04.280]  happened to you well I countered them like I'll have a poster there of Obama
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:10.360]  given immunity to the Bush administration for war crimes I've actually had some of
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:15.560]  the bomb about look at that say oh that isn't true and then I challenged them I
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.000]  said well let's get on the computer here and take a look at it and they'll walk
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.400]  away like my like I have AIDS or something they kind of get away because
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:30.000]  their false identity that their winners there with Obama that fantasy like buying
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.640]  the lottery ticket I'm gonna want to you know five million dollars this week and
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.840]  of course you don't one chance out of a billion doesn't matter for that one week
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.960]  they can fantasize what they're gonna do with a billion dollars I can't tell you
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.600]  about half people I know in Austin are musicians talented they all imagine
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:48.160]  they're gonna be rock stars or rap stars or whatever it is and they run around in
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.040]  circles all day saying I can't wait till I'm famous and some of them are like
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:56.720]  55 years old and don't even have a band but they really think they're gonna be
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.680]  famous why don't they go out and love what they're doing and have a good time
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.280]  with it or teach kids how to play instruments or whatever no no no they're
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:10.720]  they feel unfulfilled until they have become rock stars and we're a nation of
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.640]  of imaginary wannabe delusional narcissistic because they can't have it
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.000]  there's a new mental illness I'm seeing well it's an old mental illness but it's
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.120]  intensifying I don't know what you call it where people actually decide they're
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:26.120]  famous when they're not and then just are mean to people to have power over
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.920]  them it's pretty sick but keep it up great job doesn't matter if the sheep
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:34.600]  will laugh at you they don't count I mean these people can't even stand up at
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.600]  the White House I mean I mean the average Democratic follower is so dumb
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.920]  down even though they're a young woman they can't even stand up and before she
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:47.320]  fell over she was like probably had 500 vaccine probably doesn't even know two

[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:36.000]  well my friends the federal government has financed the journal the pediatrics
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.480]  twice to come out and say that mercury is good for brain tissue doesn't matter
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.440]  that mercury is one of the most documented heavy metals to be totally
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:50.160]  destructive to brain tissue and actually caused electrochemical explosions in the
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.600]  brain and we've written countless news articles about that showing electron
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:59.520]  microscope film footage of what tiny amounts of mercury the type that's in
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.720]  vaccines that the the thimerosal does the brain but when the government says
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.560]  mercury is good for your learning and behavior they mean learning how to be a
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.120]  dumb-down zombie learning how to go to the White House and collapse because
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:19.680]  you're so damaged from the GMO the fluoride in the water and the bromine the
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:24.720]  lack of proper nascent iodine and just the horrible diet I mean we are a
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:28.000]  curse nation that's a fact but before I get to this breaking news and having
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.600]  studio folks that actually support going around trying to get kids to take more
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.440]  vaccines ghoulish type characters lunatics in my view in my opinion I
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.920]  don't think it is my opinion crazies I want to play you some other crazies this
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.920]  is CBS News locally begin this aired all over the country locally to package
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:49.840]  produce nationally that local teleprompter readers read because in psyops you
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:55.000]  believe locals more than national but remember these are really national folks
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.640]  parroting what came from the national talking point that mercury is good for
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.960]  your brain and remember Obama said Obamacare is performing better than
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:07.600]  thought and it's really doing great right now so mercury is good Obamacare is
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:11.600]  great raising the debt ceiling does not raise the debt ceiling the founding
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:16.640]  fathers are bad freedom is bad tyranny is good drink your fluoride even though
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.200]  the Harvard study admits it gives you cancer and lowers your IQ but we need
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.840]  your IQ lowered under Common Core they teach down the public schools two plus
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:29.240]  two equals five and if you don't agree without your racist so let's go ahead and
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:33.440]  go to this to CBS clip here it is mercury containing vaccines may help not
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:37.480]  harm kids according to three new studies in the journal pediatrics and pigs may
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:41.480]  have been wiped by concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.840]  impair the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.400]  the offices that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.400]  behavior and mental performance and of course Ted Turner wants 90% of us dead
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:36:00.360]  so I guess improved mental behavior is you're in a coffin so I mean this is the
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.160]  craziness we're dealing with I'm crazy because I have medical doctors on
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.760]  exposing what's really happening now if you go to the CDC and just type in
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:15.560]  vaccine side effects you'll get the major vaccines that are out there and
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:21.240]  there's thousands of pages but just the synopsis is more than 30 pages long and
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:27.440]  it's got death headache stuffy nose abdominal pain diarrhea fever blood in
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.480]  your inner stool pneumonia inflammation of stomach and intestines yeah how about
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:36.800]  Crohn's disease you can get you know just all sorts of stuff death headaches
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:45.120]  fatigue guion beret seizures permanent seizures fussiness vomiting tiredness
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.920]  autoimmune disorders you can just go through all the wonderful things
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:58.600]  fevers brain damage the list just goes on and on all the horrible things it does
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:05.040]  to you of course Gardasil can kill you cause brain damage autoimmune disorders
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:10.240]  so you know I just suggest that you go and check all this out because with
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:16.200]  other drugs deafness long-term seizures coma lowered consciousness permanent
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:22.080]  brain damage this is from but every year before school they put out paid for
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.120]  magazine newspaper TV things saying there are no side effects Alex Jones the
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:29.920]  line scumbag we've read these articles other people are lying scumbags doctor
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.480]  playlock brain surgeon went on Alex Jones AP reported he's horrible he said
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.440]  it's causing autism and brain damage and he's a big fat liar and I mean here we
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:43.760]  are just reading from from the documents themselves I just keep keep going
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.240]  here with the death and the nausea and the neurological disorders and just
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.360]  everything else that the stuff does and then of course they have a multi-billion
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.760]  dollar fund that you can jump through thousands of hoops and if your doctor
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.800]  does his job and reports it was the vaccine that then they'll pay you out
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.960]  of paltry some for your brain damaged child and they make you shine a vaccine
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:09.240]  adverse events reporting system to you know see what's going on to fine-tune
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.280]  their vaccines so they don't openly damage you right away they want you to
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.720]  crawl off and die a long painful death of the medical system can suck all your
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.880]  money out first while your child has to have their diapers changed till they're
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.160]  35 and then finally die so that's all part of the plan right there just thought
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:27.440]  you might want to know about all that and we have right here for the flu shot
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.960]  itself from the CDC dot gov all the things it can do to you geomberase
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:43.720]  seizures deaths all sorts of thyroid problems hives angina just just heart
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:50.240]  problems again neurological disorders being paralyzed just I mean just some
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:55.640]  really really really really fun stuff here that's gonna go on of course now
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:01.040]  all that said the the flu shot never protects you from the actual flu that's
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.280]  out there and actually lowers your immunity and doubles your chances the
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:07.480]  next year of getting the regular seasonal flu that's a major Canadian
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:12.880]  British joint study and there's also US studies showing that so I thought we
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.400]  would send out the crew to some of the local places that are pushing I mean
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.840]  hey want 10% off your bill take a shot we get kickbacks from the government that
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.520]  wants to hurt you of course the average person working there doesn't know this
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:28.080]  or hey fluoride for babies in the water or in the formula when they've said for
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:32.840]  seven years don't give it to children to age five and it lowers IQ and and makes
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:36.480]  their teeth have fluorosis when their teeth erupted but you know so what I
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:42.840]  mean who needs an IQ so we're gonna be handing out these fliers us is know the
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.920]  risk of the flu shot the CDC website admits the following concerning the
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:51.680]  seasonal flu shot you could get Guillain-Barre syndrome from the flu shot
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.440]  and it says source CDC.gov we just showed you that serious reactions can
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:59.280]  occur from getting the shot reactions include breathing problems well who
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.840]  needs to breathe hoarseness or wheezing hives paleness weakness and fast
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.960]  heartbeat or dizziness sure but of course Guillain-Barre being paralyzed
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.800]  that's fine and it goes on said you can get sick from the shot and even get the
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.360]  flu after receiving the shot we'll actually show actuaries again insurance
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:20.320]  companies know right after the shots roll out that's when it starts just like
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:24.480]  they've got to keep a polio going so they give live polio vaccine still with
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:27.800]  live cancer virus sent in and and and they've got it down where it's a
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:32.000]  footnote in the paper yeah 60 plus thousand kids got paralyzed bunch up and
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.200]  died after the after the shots Bill and Linda Gates Foundation India just don't
[01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:41.640]  worry about it but by the way you know a cop dropped a ham sandwich let's have a
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:46.520]  parade for it you know it just it just I think that's normal I think that's good
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:56.840]  so we now have with us nurse death and Prozac the killer clown both of them are
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:03.000]  here in studio with us today and you guys are going to now be going out to
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.120]  different facilities around Austin you know encouraging people to take their
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.840]  vaccines but actually giving them little handouts with what the disorders are
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:17.080]  because they won't tell you there's any adverse reactions notice with any other
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.200]  drug dead metal the best if it can do to you on the TV yet or at least but not in
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:25.320]  these they tell you safe and effective it's a conspiracy theory it only helps
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.360]  you and so and it's not that vaccines couldn't be a technology that could
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:32.600]  actually be good it's that a secret government that does testing on us and
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:38.240]  is a criminal record of injecting people with syphilis and human papilloma viruses
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.720]  SV 40 viruses that they admit gave a hundred million people cancer and killed
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.560]  most of them that's all public but I think you guys may be right we should
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:52.040]  have people take more shots we should trust these people and take their
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.760]  injections and let them lie to us and say there's no adverse reaction so nurse
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.200]  death I'm very proud of the work you're doing actually I think your guys are
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:03.840]  really doing a horrible thing out there and we have pros act the killer killer
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.920]  clown here with us and guys tell us tell us about why you support this and want
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:14.360]  to get the kids to to take their shots and then get a lollipop well thanks for
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:20.120]  having us on here Alex I just wanted to say oh man what a theme park of suffering
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:24.440]  you just went through there that was beautiful I love side effects I love
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:29.760]  here in the bottom and thank you for bringing them all out I mean myself this morning I had
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:35.080]  bloating my ulcer exploded I had some gas but the nurse gets you put some stuff
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:38.840]  in me I'm not sure if it's me or the stuff she's put in me that made me feel
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:42.960]  worse but you have irritable bowel a trail diarrhea behind you oh absolutely
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:48.440]  they have to get the mop in here anyway what a wonderful thing one thing you
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:58.240]  didn't mention was the formaldehyde that causes cancer oh you know instead of
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:01.640]  just giving the kids lollipops for a Pavlovian response of getting their
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.240]  IQ reduction shot could we have formaldehyde lollipops and just kill them
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:08.560]  right there on the spot what I'd like to see is everybody just dress up as
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.920]  guinea pigs because I see all of you stupid guinea pigs if we could just
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.320]  load you up every one of you if you could just put some kind of guinea pig
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.800]  uniform on or maybe a lemon thing jump off a cliff as you're suffering well
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.640]  that would be nice to Ted Turner would actually like to just kill us right out
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:30.440]  but but I mean John beholder says we do it to the water on the shots instead yes
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:35.200]  Ted Turner pushed me down a flight of stairs so I'm just kidding I don't know
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.560]  what happened to me yesterday because all the side effects but what isn't great
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:44.960]  hey hey what it means it's nice teeth I mean yeah well you seem obsessed nurse
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.280]  nurse death tell us why you're here and I guess he's a little upset you're here
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:52.680]  to administer some more mercury yes because we just heard from CBS News it's
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:56.680]  good for kids everyone should have their daily dose of cancer and mental
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:01.840]  confusion as well as diet how's that feel good give me a shot how's that feel
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:09.640]  oh you should be feeling dizzy yeah you love the new Obamacare is it free
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:13.880]  seizures oh it's totally free just get on the computer anybody's computer well
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.360]  they now say they're gonna refuse healthcare unless you take the vaccines
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:20.480]  and they're also gonna make you know Christian groups pay for abortions in
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:25.480]  that good oh absolutely in fact all the churches I'm so glad to see all the
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.960]  pastors giving in to what the money does for them instead of actually pushing
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.400]  Christian values who needs that won't get away leave it needs kids like I mean
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.760]  we could just inject the kids with mercury like Jim Jones and kill them all
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:42.120]  at the church that would be all just kill them right away but I guess if you
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.520]  kill them real slow though and give them all these diseases and brain damage and
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:49.320]  that's better explain to me nurse death why it's important to wreck their lives
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:53.280]  and make them down for 30 years and set it right away well polysorbate 80 right
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:57.960]  here causes infertility so you know just daily a little dose of this every
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:04.520]  flu. I haven't been fertile since 1973 so nurse nurse death tell us about what
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:07.240]  you're gonna be out there telling the public to do I'm gonna pull up in the
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:10.560]  van you're gonna have candy for the kids and you're gonna say I have mercury
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:14.040]  for you and at the cops say hey mercury's dangerous don't inject kids on
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:17.520]  the side of the road with mercury you go no no no no it's good for them this is
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:23.400]  part of Obamacare I'm I'm nurse death here to administer what's the big deal
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:28.560]  man a little seizures never hurt anyone well it's racist if you don't want to
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:34.200]  have a seizure exactly are you racist against brain damage and kidney failure
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:38.160]  yeah somebody comes to me it says hey I've been taking all this prozac I feel
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:44.160]  so happy but my diarrhea is out of control you know what I say racist well
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:46.920]  that's the answer actually if you say Obamacare was written by foreign
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.160]  insurance companies and is only a file on everybody and will wreck health care
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:53.840]  they just scream racist and it is racist completely racist against the
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:56.680]  globalists that are trying to get a hold of the human population and kill
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.960]  everybody hey nurse hang on it for big pharma somebody called Obama I think
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:05.520]  I'm gonna say somebody get Obama here hey look you notice everybody on that
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:08.560]  stage look like they couldn't tie their shoelaces I guess they've been having
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:15.000]  their shots huh you know only three of those people that actually signed up
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.080]  he found out they think they signed up right six people in America that were
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:25.440]  able to get through and he had them on stage you gotta love it it's just

[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:46.280]  the floor nurse death we've heard enough from Prozac the killer clown over
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:52.440]  there are you proud of of the fact that he is the master drug that sub
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.160]  derivatives of almost every shooter has been on and that he's never gotten the
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:59.240]  blame even though the insert says it'll make you commit mass murder and kill
[01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.280]  people and make you delusional and then you add it with Pentagon designed shoot
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.120]  them up killing games that teach you to have instinctive shooting and they go

[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:52.280]  ahead yeah first of all I want to say I'm a huge fan and that you're truly
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:56.160]  inspirational well thank you brother we're just trying to survive like
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:58.520]  everybody else and beat these tolerance are on our back
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:02.960]  yeah I see what you mean but last spring I graduated high school and over the
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.120]  summer I was looking for work and I decided to become an insurance agent
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:09.200]  there's a lot of people said that with the Affordable Care Act that isn't so
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.920]  affordable that I'd be able to make a lot of money in it so I was just seeing
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:16.080]  how I want you to elaborate on what you think are some of the biggest flaws with
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:19.720]  Obamacare when you like maybe a time frame of when it will implode or
[02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:23.440]  something like that well I mean look look look they can implement anyway they
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:28.160]  want like all these big bills these ominous bills it's got 10,000 now it's
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.600]  12,000 pages of writers it's a 3,000 page bill and it's got death panels it's got
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.320]  the insurance companies wrote it to lower the standard of care and charge you
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:41.200]  more make you buy it I mean when I say it's gonna implode it's gonna implode the
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:45.560]  country but they're gonna I mean it's the biggest tax ever a private corporate
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:51.040]  tax to offshore banks that own the insurance companies of up to five or
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.840]  more thousand dollars a year per person and then you won't even get to health
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.960]  care and it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions and it just cheats
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:01.320]  everybody I mean it is just the ultimate screw job and our health care
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:05.480]  systems gotten bad it was the best in the world nobody doubted that because
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:09.680]  insurance companies and HMOs got involved and rigged it to begin with to
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:14.960]  overcharge people that have insurance and then you know screw up the charity
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:20.080]  care system so I don't know but I mean look this is the computer system is
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:23.840]  designed to not work and the Obama supporters are already saying they like
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:28.240]  it not working I mean they're just it's a cult they would drink cyanide kool-aid
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:32.080]  in order to do so and the Republican leadership attack Ted Cruz and Rand Paul
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:38.400]  they helped write it their own by the same interest they want it so I mean
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.880]  we're in deep trouble I mean a tyrants get away with a lot once they're in
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.040]  charge so I don't know what's gonna happen I mean I but it's gonna sink the
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:50.360]  country I know that what do you think's gonna happen I really don't know I just
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:53.200]  graduated high school at spring I thought this would be a good opportunity you
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:56.360]  know my dad's been insurance agent for 20 years you know and he said with the
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:59.680]  Affordable Care Act that a lot of everyone's gonna need insurance and you
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:02.840]  know for everything I'm hearing from you I hear I hear full time to the story you
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:05.480]  know I hear the insurance side which everyone says it's good and then I
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:09.160]  hear your side how it's terrible and it's going to listen most insurance people
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:13.120]  I talked to are freaking out the last year because they've already seen it go
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.360]  up just in anticipation they're now on average doubling people's premium I mean
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:21.680]  everybody I know their premiums doubled everybody I know their premiums
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:28.280]  doubled my dad's mine I mean everybody and we never even use our insurance had
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:32.120]  rolled over there a big liberal who supported it early on he's got six
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:37.000]  employees it's doubled it's doubled already do you know it's set to double
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.040]  again by 2015 you think people can pay that people can pay twenty thousand
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:49.520]  dollars a year but it's a win-win the insurance companies make
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:52.480]  everybody get it they lower the quality and the government gets to find
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:56.320]  everybody that can't do it they're gonna take your house they're gonna take
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.560]  every they're gonna garnish your wages that's why they want a digital grid in
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:05.560]  once they have a digital grid in once they can track everything it's over
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:10.320]  okay and we told you it was crashing two and a half weeks ago a week before
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:17.040]  Forbes did on purpose it isn't a screw-up they could have had chimpanzees on
[02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:22.240]  Mountain Dew and PCP with typewriters write better code okay the front works
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:26.000]  there's nothing behind it it's a the only thing that works is getting your
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.480]  data okay it gets your data and it gets some type of this is out today some type
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:37.080]  of NSA datamined connection to your computer they want to track who doesn't
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:42.560]  have insurance to now put you in a database to gang rape your paycheck
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.680]  okay I mean that's it they were targeting you to get poor people's
[02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:53.440]  paychecks I mean it's incredible evil that's what the ovomet care is okay and
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:56.360]  look folks people know I'm nonpartisan I'm a libertarian I've never seen
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:01.800]  anything like Obama I mean he is the worst president ever financial experts

[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:27.520]  disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network Benjamin Smith was on
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:32.880]  Fox News last week and it made national news X Navy seal government
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:41.640]  provoking vets to bring on martial law and he joins us right now he of course
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:45.880]  was up there with the World War two vets and others for veterans rights and
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.720]  against having the memorials that are open air and don't have security at them
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:53.720]  being purposely closed we've had park officials say they were told to do that
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:57.360]  to quote make people as miserable as possible that's an associated press
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:04.560]  headline and he joins us to go over some of the things that are happening and
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:13.560]  going on he's a veteran of quite a few different tours US Navy 2000 2005 a seal
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:18.920]  2001 served in Iraq shot America and the Horn of Africa I guess Somalia and around
[02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:23.360]  there and now he works or has been working as a private security company in
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:28.280]  Iraq since 2006 so I'd love to get him on some time just to talk about what
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:33.160]  those experiences were like but I wanted to get him on so he wouldn't just have a
[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:37.880]  few minutes like Fox to spend 20 minutes with us and really break down what
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:43.960]  he saw at the memorials the intel he's got from elected officials and others
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:49.640]  about the plan to try to get vets into some type of conflict with the federal
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:55.440]  government and how he thinks we can try to avert the bad situation this country
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:00.520]  has gotten into so Benjamin Smith thank you for coming on with us okay yeah man
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:06.760]  it's it's it's good to be on X Navy seal like if you hear X that usually means
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:11.200]  you've been kicked out I'm former but you know that's right former you didn't
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:20.960]  get kicked out sure yeah some veteran cool oh man it's this is this is such a
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:28.240]  topic that is talked about within the movement people who understand military
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:34.400]  and strategy and tactics there's you know most people the conversation you
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:41.880]  hear amongst people you see speaking at rallies at functions even political
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:47.920]  people elected officials the conversation it's it's kind of the
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:51.800]  conversation where you look over each shoulder and you start having the talk
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:58.000]  because you feel really uncomfortable having it that in your country a logical
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.600]  conversation is now being had and has been for a bit but you don't see it on
[02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:08.600]  any of the news things where the government might be trying to get you
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:14.800]  into a position that is the most painful for us you know like downturn of
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:22.320]  economies and all of trying to get us to provoke us to do something either
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:26.480]  violent or stupid there's always low-hanging fruit you have them on the
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:33.080]  left you have them on the right and they're trying to get those people to
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:38.200]  start doing something stupid and you know at that point they can shut us down
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:45.840]  and you know whenever anyone says martial law that kind of is buzzword for
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:53.720]  say lefty politicians or a lot of people who aren't aware of anything to just
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:59.560]  start saying conspiracy theorists these guys are not so windbag crazy fringe
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:05.680]  violent you know like all those things and then if you do your research and you
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:10.280]  look at what they've said and you know just get down to the facts instead of
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.520]  sounding rebellious and you just have the logical conversation you can
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:20.720]  logically go about pointing to things and say yeah that's what they're trying to
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:27.920]  do it's it's obvious in the conversation topics at that memorial was you know most
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:33.720]  veterans see this in conversations I have with you know people with a speck
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:39.360]  up background not going to go into specifics on on who but it within the
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:46.200]  within the communities you can see it and it's it's a it's a logical
[02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:50.640]  conversation not as in the topic of like you know we need to rebel and
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:56.520]  violence no that's not it it's very much a logical here's what we see here's why
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:02.000]  here's what they've said here's what's happened here's who's it affected and you
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.640]  know here's the outcome and just in the pure analysis a logical analysis of
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:12.640]  things that have been happening over the past you know you got five years
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:16.680]  because you've got Obama in office now but if you trace it back you can look
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:23.120]  all the way back to you know Russia and all like the Cold War you know like
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:27.520]  things like that it's there's a lot of logical streams to whereas things are
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:33.080]  starting to come to a head now and if we're uneducated and don't have the
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.880]  wherewithal to do our research to read to look at history and how it repeats
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:44.640]  itself we are subject to losing everything absolutely and you know it
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:51.120]  could be another 1200 years before anything that would resemble freedom you
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:55.040]  know individual sovereignty would ever surface again you know what I'm saying
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:59.840]  oh I absolutely hear what you're saying and again veteran Navy SEAL Benjamin
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:04.400]  Smith is our guest we should probably contact the folks with biz pacer review
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:07.520]  because they do say ex Navy SEAL but most people unless you've been in the
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:13.800]  military just think that means former but veteran Navy SEAL joins us and talk
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:18.960]  about if you can your colleagues other veterans the armed services I know what
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:24.520]  I see I know family I have that are in the military I know what I get from
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:29.000]  Stuart Rhodes the head of both keepers and countless other contacts I have FBI
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:35.040]  agents former secret service agents current people like Dan Bongino you know
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:41.080]  he says about half the enlisted he talks to or awake about 60 70% 80% of
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:45.600]  special warfare people I was down to San Antonio open carry rattle rally this
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:49.480]  weekend and there were San Antonio cops there in plain clothes with their guns
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:53.920]  and there were Army psyops people there saying almost everybody's awake and
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.960]  they said a year ago it was less than 50% so I'm seeing a massive awakening to
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:04.200]  criminal elements across the board and government that are trying to convert our
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:09.960]  Republic over to a banana-style situation so tell us from your colleagues
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:14.440]  you know the folks you were there at the rallies what you're witnessing and what
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:21.600]  the numbers are you're seeing Benjamin well going back to the the beginning of
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:28.000]  this administration there were I've I've had friends within the community talking
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:36.200]  about how they were brought in and you know questioned with people from you
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:40.920]  know more towards the top side and the questioning resulted in kind of where
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:47.920]  the where it was pointing was you know do you feel comfortable disarming
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:52.160]  American citizens and you can see that now with the shedding of a lot of the
[02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:57.880]  officers and stuff like that it's it's you know we don't have the 100% track on
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:03.320]  it but you know that there's a lot of funny things happening within military
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:08.000]  now that's bombshell but I want to quantify that I have secret service FBI
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.640]  sources on record on the air but also covert sources that are currently in
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:17.200]  they say exactly that for two years there is a litmus test where officers
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:22.160]  from the generals down to lieutenant generals down to majors down to sergeant
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:27.560]  you know master sergeants will you fire on US citizens and if you say no you're
[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:31.680]  sent to the worst hellhole or basically kicked out if you say yes you're put
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:35.680]  into special homeland security units quantify you're saying people in the
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:39.920]  community special warfare community are saying they have been brought into
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:47.480]  litmus test meetings yeah and at this at this moment in this conversation it's
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:57.160]  got to bring it back to van jones oh yeah like you remember him when he said
[02:16:57.160 --> 02:17:02.240]  you have to like for us to have the argument or to just have the
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:07.320]  conversation logically and what he was saying with like the communists in the
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:12.280]  left he's in the everything that he ban Jones is it's you drop the radical pose
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:17.480]  for the radical ends and just to translate that into what this is you
[02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:24.560]  know I understand a lot of libertarian Ron Paul a lot of people that that are
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:30.920]  your listeners get like fervent and very strong about it and it's not about you
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:36.240]  know being that person that's the loudest right there having that logical
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:40.440]  conversation to where as someone else can reply and you can go back with facts
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:47.080]  and it's it's a logical conversation that needs to be had and it's starting to
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:53.160]  you know like I couldn't believe he asked that hammer actually asked me on
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.680]  air about you know it was it was kind of a surprise that he asked me like you
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:01.840]  know you think that the government's trying to declare martial law and they're
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:07.000]  going like oh Jesus this an ambush if I answer this wrong this is you know
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.040]  everything goes down the drain and I'm a I'm a I'm a kook but the thing is
[02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:16.960]  Sheila Jackson Lee you always have somebody if you've even got the tightest
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:24.760]  plan there's always somebody who gives up the jig or says something that's more
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:30.080]  right to the point than anything else well that's right the rhetoric from the
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:33.600]  authoritarian left because they're not really liberals Thomas Jefferson was a
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:37.520]  liberal I see myself as a real liberal you know more freedom these people are
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.960]  not liberals and that's all they talk about is how they want to round up the
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:46.680]  tea party I mean that's in Forbes and the Washington Times and then she gives a
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:50.360]  speech and talks about political martial law well that's the first order of
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.960]  martial law is political before it becomes physical and Obama says he may
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.560]  have to do stuff without Congress and NATO is over our military I'm just
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:05.040]  backing you up Benjamin Smith joining us veteran Navy seal just all over the
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:10.040]  Middle East and Africa you name it joining us here and and you know he's
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:13.640]  really the tip of the spear he's willing to openly say what most people I
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:19.880]  talked to have you told me privately about their concern but let's expand on
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.800]  this then you know studying warfare studying psychological warfare using
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:28.800]  truth the ultimate weapon in that having our goal having the the moral high
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:34.680]  ground our goal for liberty what do you think we should do then I mean I agree
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:38.080]  takes different folks some people get angry some people are more logical
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:41.800]  reaching out but what do we do to shake people out of their trance what do we
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:45.920]  do to let people know that that they're that the new Army training manual and
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:51.520]  I put it on screen that judicial watch got two months ago says George Washington
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:56.880]  wouldn't be welcome in today's army well George Washington founded the army go
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:03.280]  ahead mm-hmm what do we do well by you've got you've gotten manuals and it's
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:08.640]  just to go to that point really quick you've got in in in the military what
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:17.200]  the West Point they have Peliger who now if there's there's a teaching doctrine
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:23.600]  where they're actually talking about moderate right-wing conservatives as you
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:30.720]  know the the military may have to actually you know quell American people
[02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:35.400]  and that's what they're teaching hot the future leaders of the military but
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:42.240]  what needs to happen is the the military people who are having these
[02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:49.320]  conversations need to start stepping into the public sphere the political
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:57.840]  sphere like now the percentage of people who are in government is from the
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:21:03.560]  military is about like 15 to 20 percent and possibly even less when you know
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:10.040]  even around Vietnam after and before it was over 75 percent well that's a great
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:18.160]  point we need veterans in the government not lawyers yes and and the lawyers you
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:21.960]  know I don't want to I don't want to like declare war on lawyers you know we
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:27.280]  absolutely need them sure but the government types sure yeah of course
[02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:33.600]  it's it's the the people need to understand that the veterans at least in
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:38.600]  boot camp have gone through and eaten dirt have had to get over their petty
[02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:45.520]  differences race orientation what whatever it may be that you have wrong
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:50.000]  with the person that's next to you you've got to fulfill a mission you've got
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.800]  something that you have to do or you're all gonna pay the man because of this
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:58.760]  the screw-up that you're doing and it's it's all about like unity and
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:02.800]  understanding getting past your differences the military folk have to
[02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:08.960]  start reaching out to normal citizens and having that logical conversation of
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:14.280]  instead of just being because I remember when I came back I was you know I would
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:19.840]  be a little short with people that like you don't get it and it's like it was
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:24.240]  hard to kind of get into the conversation like how do you see this this is
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:28.040]  how I see it this is what I have seen this is what I've read this is how
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:32.680]  history is gone it's kind of obvious and then after talking with them and
[02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:37.520]  hearing what they have to say it starts to the back and forth and they start
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:43.800]  going like oh this guy isn't like some pipe-hitting you know monkey that that
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:47.760]  runs around with no brain there's there's thought there and you know what
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:52.560]  there's a there's a leadership that is in a lot of the military people so that
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:57.160]  understanding that these people are trying to do the best and they're a
[02:22:57.160 --> 02:23:04.040]  little angry that a lot of people don't get it it's military people need to
[02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:08.280]  start really stepping up and having the conversation as as if it's you're
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:13.280]  sitting around of a fireside chat and the truth needs to come out as
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:18.480]  uncomfortable as it is it has to be logically approached and we have to
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:22.880]  also realize that if you turn on any movie or almost any cartoon it demonizes
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:27.680]  patriotic militia types it demonizes libertarians it demonizes people for
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:31.240]  20 years that think a new world order is coming a corporate global governance
[02:23:31.240 --> 02:23:35.360]  they were preemptively brainwashing folks so that when the real threat came
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:39.520]  in we wouldn't recognize it we've got to get past hearing what they say about us
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:44.760]  because that is a scyop and I believe and I know from the evidence we're on
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:49.240]  the March the public is waking up that's why they do want to get some type of
[02:23:49.240 --> 02:23:53.480]  insurrection going because we're politically starting to really wake
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:58.240]  people up take how MSNBC pushes racial division all day and says if you don't
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:02.280]  support Obamacare that's a total ripoff you're racist again they're trying to
[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:06.440]  divide and conquer so the answer is come together around the Bill of Rights the
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:10.960]  Constitution the family private property the Second Amendment free speech I
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:15.880]  think that's the big solution what else do you think the solution well they're
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:20.720]  promoting the reluctant anti-hero you know you see like in movies and all that
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:27.680]  kind of stuff you know and then they go right back to being a sack of poop it's
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:32.960]  kind of like when how you live your life you have to live your life like you
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:38.760]  want to be remembered and it's just try to do the right thing at all times you
[02:24:38.760 --> 02:24:43.160]  know we're all gonna mess up our side needs to circle the wagons around the
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:47.280]  people that it feels are worth it instead of if you do one thing long
[02:24:47.280 --> 02:24:52.040]  you're not us you're giving us a bad name and they banishing exactly there's
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:57.080]  there's a mindset that you have to live by I'm always gonna do the best for the
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:02.920]  people who believe of what America is founding logic those people those people
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:08.120]  George Washington Jefferson Adams all those guys they lived through revolution
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:13.840]  war on their land and their families were killed there everything was pillaged
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:17.680]  it was more of a civil war than a revolution you know it was amongst
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:22.840]  ourselves for the direction of a country and a battle it was a battle of
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:28.240]  perseverance to is who could go the longest yeah and it's it always boils
[02:25:28.240 --> 02:25:35.280]  down to you know usually two options good bad good evil pull the trigger don't
[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:40.240]  pull the trigger life death eat star you know what I mean like you want to bring
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:45.600]  it down to what's going on here not 15 different option free or slave and we
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:48.600]  know the direction we're going slavery let me ask you this on the time we have
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:52.680]  we're gonna give your website out it's Benjamin Smith dot US comm Benjamin
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:57.680]  Smith dot US comm radio listeners want to go check that out TV listeners can see
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:02.040]  at the time we have get into you know what you were saying on Fox but but but
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:06.520]  any other points you want to make about them trying to obviously make people mad
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:10.360]  not letting them into the memorials using more police than they would have
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:14.560]  their normally to keep them shut I mean that is clearly what do you think they
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:18.800]  were wanting to do what do you think Obama and his controllers were looking
[02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:26.080]  for oh wait a second this is this is from that day people have videos and I
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:30.640]  know your people will jump all over it trying to research it there there was
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:35.240]  some people coming over to me and saying there were three three cops at least
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:41.400]  three saying that they were being funded this is metro police I don't know if
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:44.840]  this is absolute crap but the thing was I was listening to the people who just
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:51.080]  came from listening to them say it three cops actually admitted that IMF was
[02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:57.040]  funding them being cops that day because IMF was doing something in DC I mean
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:02.240]  research it stuff like that oh yeah I had my reporters arrested at the G20 for
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:08.880]  just filming in a park and it was it was paid for and run by G20 security for
[02:27:08.880 --> 02:27:13.320]  the G20 you're saying the IMF we've got to look into this that's big was actually
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:16.640]  well that's who runs the whole thing that's who's taking us over as foreign
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:21.800]  banks I figured you'd you'd like chewing on that I'd like I'd love to hear the
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:25.360]  results and what turns up on that let me shift gears real quick and I'd love to
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:28.760]  anytime you come through Texas get you in studio or get you on Skype and say
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:31.960]  any other final points you've got or you can stay that's fine I heard you had to
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:37.760]  go let me ask you about this and again a veteran Navy SEAL joins us a Benjamin
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:43.160]  Smith right now this article it's been on Fox News to Washington Times family
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:48.560]  suspect SEAL Team 6 crash was inside job on worst day in Afghanistan I was
[02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:53.000]  told that by a Navy SEAL and SEAL Team 3 not in SEAL Team 6 who had a friend in
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:57.080]  SEAL Team 6 weeks after the crash and I'm on record the first person ever say
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:27:59.960]  it I know that's hard to talk about but do you have anything to say on that
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:06.520]  subject I'm not at this time I mean you know how the how the memorial and stuff
[02:28:06.520 --> 02:28:15.240]  went down in in Afghanistan with a in a mom praying over our SEALs was is my
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:19.200]  main issue with that but you know past that I'm not I'm not gonna touch that
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:24.520]  sure could any other points you think are important to make about the state of
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:33.640]  where this country is right now yeah it lies within ourselves it's the
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:39.880]  possibility of our government not being on our side ideologically stating so in
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:46.520]  you know if the president says you judge me by who I put around me okay look at
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:52.840]  that now look at us are they what we believe or not so you know you have to
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:57.560]  have that conversation start talking to people you don't know or people who
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:01.360]  disagree with you and try to have the logical conversation they will eventually
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:07.080]  start to see that you're intelligent and you're not a cooke just do your
[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:16.280]  research and sound be just in a conversation not to be angry I agree
[02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:22.040]  what what are you doing in your life right now well it's you said I've been
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:27.000]  over in Iraq and stuff since oh six no I haven't been over there since oh six
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:32.760]  okay that was just a bio they sent over yeah yeah right now I'm just I'm I'm
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:37.160]  doing a lot of public speaking trying to get the message out I I mean I believe
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:43.280]  in what America is and I've given everything I've had to this movement
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:47.160]  and to what I believe it's like you know it consumes a lot of people hold on

[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:40.080]  our borough of rights and Constitution is being dismantled and then the
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:43.320]  Republican leadership joined with the Democrats to go after Ted Cruz and Rand
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:47.760]  Paul and others who were pointing out that Obamacare is a total fraud and then
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:51.800]  now it doesn't work and Obama says it's the greatest things in sliced bread but
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:56.520]  I mean you were really saying some powerful stuff during the breaks so
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:00.200]  Benjamin I mean tell folks I mean you know lead folks tell folks what you're
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:02.840]  trying to do because I was asking you what do you think we should do and you're
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:06.760]  making some really great points during the break so finish up with some
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:13.880]  comments yeah well with with everything that we've gained our freedom from
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:22.880]  through the revolution back in 1700s it wasn't individual sovereignty it wasn't
[02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:30.480]  the freedom which we all talk about now that got us the freedom that we have and
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:37.720]  that we're kind of wasting away it was unity it was discipline it was people
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:42.920]  working together and sacrificing for each other for like it was the battlefield
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:48.440]  of ideas it was you know that unity between between you and the person
[02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:54.760]  next to you and the thing is they started to as as we need to do now come
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:59.680]  together in business we need to start monetizing what we do because everybody
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:04.320]  out there on on like on the speaking circuit or if anybody's standing they're
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:10.760]  being attacked by IRS and in the IRS now a lot of us are considered I'm a
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:19.480]  propagandist but like a lot of working together doing things and sacrificing
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:24.800]  for each other and and giving and then giving again to each other that has to
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:29.800]  start happening and it's it turns into a groundswell I mean it's not going to be
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:34.280]  as well said as I said during the break but to the to the big the broader
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:38.640]  picture like when we're talking about martial law martial law spends the
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:44.720]  Constitution of the United States what would our government want to do and I
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:48.440]  know this goes over to a lot of your people as well if they suspend the
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:52.440]  Constitution martial law happens for five minutes or whatever the NDA a made
[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:57.600]  martial law and posse chromatitis would that allow immediately that would allow
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:03.360]  you when to come into the United States and whatever entity that doesn't like
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:07.520]  us you know it's it's it's an open door and Sheila Jackson Lee calls it for it
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:13.960]  openly on the house on the house floor which is absolutely insane
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:19.360]  no these people are dangerous and and and I agree with you we're all under
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:21.960]  attack I think the number one thing people have to get to their heads that
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:26.720]  are libertarian veterans conservatives just people that love freedom people that
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:31.240]  just love the American system compared to communism and fascism people who don't
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:36.240]  want to be slaves we're in a war we're under attack and and denying it gives
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:40.640]  the enemy the total advantage we have to admit we're under attack and every man
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:45.600]  woman and child has to pick little goals and complete them and just resisting
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:49.800]  this in the info war resisting it monetarily resisting it by supporting
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:55.240]  patriots resisting it by saying no to tyrants we will bring them down it's a
[02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:59.560]  cold civil war is what's going on you know there's no violence yet and it's
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:04.520]  for the direction of a country we have to find what we agree upon everyone's so
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:09.160]  used to pointing at something and bitching about it but they're not they
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.720]  don't know to go to it you run to the sound of those shots being fired and
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:20.280]  you do right you do good to the end of your being you do what is right you
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:27.000]  know find what you agree with somebody on not emphasize what you don't you know
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:30.240]  what I'm saying because everybody's fallible everybody's got things wrong
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:35.520]  with them find what binds you together not what separates I agree I mean I
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:39.400]  really after 18 years on air in 20 years fighting for liberty and just the
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:44.040]  last year people that have attacked me done wrong to me it doesn't matter I've
[02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:47.880]  just forgiven them and ignored it and not spent time you know you know trying
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:52.760]  to you know hurt them or anything because I realize unity is the key the
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:56.480]  globalists are coming down on us we've got to get together and focus on that
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:04.640]  issue mm-hmm mm-hmm yeah oh man but continuing I mean I mean I mean other
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:08.960]  points other points because let me ask you this question I am striving to get
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:13.880]  people awake so that so that the global crime syndicate the operatives they can
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:17.440]  look at things and tell they're not gonna win if they launch a false flag and
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:21.600]  try to blame us or provocateur something or bring in Al Qaeda people they're
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:27.120]  protecting and whatever happens to try to distract us but what happens if they
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:32.200]  do start trying to take guns what do we do if they do stop you not just audit
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:35.640]  people that are in the tea party or audit veterans that speak out and
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:39.200]  persecute us what if they start trying to round people up and say we're
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:48.480]  terrorists what happens at that point well it's this is this is like one of
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:54.520]  my other things like in conversation look at the second amendment it says a
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:59.040]  well regulated militia and that doesn't mean controlled by government that just
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:03.400]  means well trained that means you know they could shoot move and communicate
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:08.120]  together and you know in working together with other citizens who believe
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:17.320]  the same thing a militia is just the last bastion of what an American has you
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:22.480]  know as per the Bill of Rights you know you guys at least get to join together
[02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:29.400]  and stand against or at least you know if you draw the line in the sand you
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:37.000]  shall go no further you shall not pass that right there is is you know that's
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.240]  the last bastion and you're starting to see all that stuff pop up and
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:46.240]  conversation there needs to be had as well it's not a bad word well the
[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:49.600]  good news is and just to quantify it and then we're gonna let you go because I
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.240]  know you've got a meeting you've got to go to here what about the numbers I mean
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:57.240]  you were telling me off air that yeah even the political speakers there were
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:00.720]  talking about how they want to cause a crisis and get veterans to do something
[02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:04.960]  violent when you're talking to you know folks that are currently still in the
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:08.800]  the special warfare community you were saying that they're being brought in and
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:12.320]  given the litmus test we've confirmed this is going on will you take the guns
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:16.800]  but what about just just general folks that are recently out like yourself in
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:22.440]  last five six seven years my number is over 70% now understand just how much
[02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:26.000]  trouble we're in but it is hard to believe this is really happening but
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:29.920]  it's happened everywhere else why are we surprised so what's the number I mean is
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:33.400]  there a huge awakening you're saying
[02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:39.920]  yeah I think there's a lot of there's a lot of people waking up there's a lot
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:46.560]  of fear and the fear either people can wake up or they're gonna they're
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:50.040]  gonna do something stupid kind of like you know the one that flies off the
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:54.280]  handle the knee jerk reaction that's what they're looking for because you know
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:59.360]  they're the free market has basically been destroyed look at health care that's
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:04.560]  the government owning close to 20% of it and they're wrecking it if it's and it's
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:10.560]  meant to fail it's it's meant to fail and the thing is it kills our economy if
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:15.240]  we just let it people say stand on its own merit that's 20% of our economy
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:21.000]  which is operating at a absolute subpar performance with how much debt we have
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:26.720]  and our credit levels are going low it's it just it's like this is not gonna
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:30.480]  work the people who wrote it said it's not gonna work it's systematic sabotage
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:35.200]  admit we're under economic attack we're under attack this is a globalist war
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:44.120]  period yes yes look at how we got Russia shut down their economy yes exactly
[02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:54.600]  we actually won the Cold War give us your take on that oh okay well look the
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:58.440]  Cold War you've got a socialist and self without communists and all them
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:04.280]  around him in the White House it's it you know if you're if you're playing
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:13.400]  chess that's the king the head of our country is of the political bend of our
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:19.520]  adversaries in the Cold War that to me says a lot of things that aren't that
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:22.320]  that don't say we won that's right they've captured most of the federal
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:25.160]  government but they haven't captured the military the military is waiting up
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:29.080]  they're trying to capture the states I think we just politically call them out
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:33.960]  and get really aggressive and I think that is what will will basically sap
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:37.840]  them of any moral authority they want cloward and piven to bankrupt is to blow
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:43.160]  out our engine what do we do then to get it going when they control the economy
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:48.360]  yeah and and there's there's a bunch of other stuff I mean I got to get run
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:53.640]  but talking about the cloward and piven and from from Clinton to Obama it's
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:58.440]  that's an interesting jump you know we can talk about that some other time
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:02.760]  sure folks can go to Benjamin Smith dot US comm and I find out about your
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:05.440]  upcoming speaking engagements or how do folks get you to come out and speak to
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:15.440]  their group um yeah go there I've got some and we'll have it up there on how

[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:35.560]  your courage after all your service to come back in the middle of the Republic
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:39.160]  and its greatest threat in history and to be standing against the threats and
[02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:43.280]  the audits and the authoritarianism of these communists God bless you sir it
[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:47.520]  was great having you on yep you don't unsign your oath thank you out thank you
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:50.880]  very much all right there you go tell him thank you guys cuz we're in the
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:54.880]  middle of a segment here there goes our guest we're gonna get him back on in
[02:43:54.880 --> 02:43:58.240]  the near future via Skype you can hear him there I think in a car having to go
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:00.240]  into another meeting you can hear it dinging in the background when somebody
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:04.840]  got out of the car but you know just he's there fighting and I'm fighting and
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:10.120]  I'm learning how to fight these people as I go I always use the truth but you
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:14.120]  know you don't know how to present the truth or what angle to hit at and I'm
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:20.600]  just a work in progress 20 years fighting for basic American principles basic
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:26.240]  common law principles 18 years on air and I have wrecked so many globalist
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:30.680]  operations with my listeners and I'm just one guy there are so many people out
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:36.200]  there that are better looking than I am smarter than I am tougher than I am more
[02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:42.080]  motivated than I am with less problems than I have I probably got too much of a
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:46.040]  temper a lot of the time too much energy sometimes but at least I'm trying as
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:49.760]  hard as I can and I'm telling you you need to stop every time I talked one of
[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:54.880]  these Navy SEALs or some Delta Force person or some FBI guy that they're
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:59.600]  always almost they're good guys so humble they don't even see themselves as
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:03.280]  leaders and so they're just humbly trying to do little things here and there
[02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:07.880]  and that's all good but before this turns into a shooting war folks we've
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:13.000]  got to shake people out of their doldrums we've got to get them out of
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:18.520]  their trance and get really really aggressive and he's absolutely right a
[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:22.680]  lot of people hear this information either get really scared or they want to
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:25.960]  go out and get aggressive overnight and have some physical fight with some
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:30.840]  compartmentalized threat fusion center you know down the road where the people
[02:45:30.840 --> 02:45:36.600]  don't even know what's going on half the time or because Army Psyops is being
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:39.920]  used domestically against if people think well I'll just go you know after an
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:42.480]  Army Psyops group those people are probably our biggest group of
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:45.440]  listeners because they're sitting in the middle of it they know they're
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:48.680]  compartmentalized they know their mission is unconstitutional they know
[02:45:48.680 --> 02:45:52.520]  that the globalists have captured the White House they know that we're into
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:58.120]  this situation they know that we're in deep trouble and so they're all sitting
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:02.280]  around going what do we do well I'll tell you what you do if it's printing up
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:06.640]  bumper stickers for a website you put up that's got just 10 facts about the New
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:09.880]  World Order and then 10 ways to fight back and then you stick those up in your
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:13.960]  area or you start a little newsletter that's one sheet once a week that you
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:18.880]  out at 4 a.m. go and stick in everybody's mailbox that'll do something or
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:22.760]  you go to an access TV show or you start calling to talk radio or you go out
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:26.320]  and stay on the street with a sign or you start your own blog radio show
[02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:30.480]  online or do your own YouTube channel or go to public events and grab the
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:34.040]  politician by the arm and say we don't like the New World Order takeover we
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:37.800]  know what's going on we know America's been captured Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:42.600]  groups like that they have been caught funding the anti-gun groups funding the
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:49.240]  Indiana 21 we've done reports on it point that out that hey this is a big
[02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:52.600]  deal that we've got some of these big banks and groups and I'm not even
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:55.560]  saying everybody that works with those banks are terrorist or evil or bad I
[02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:59.320]  mean those are the biggest things the economy it's the people running them we
[02:46:59.320 --> 02:47:02.440]  have to call out the they tried to put Larry Summers in as the head of the
[02:47:02.440 --> 02:47:07.120]  Federal Reserve when he engineered the current system we're in that's literally
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:12.480]  like trying to have Satan you know oversee his trial before God I mean it's
[02:47:12.480 --> 02:47:16.600]  like having the Hitler at the Nuremberg trial as the judge as a chief
[02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:21.720]  justice we have to see that we're being overwhelmed by tyranny right now and
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:25.480]  recognize it and get past the fear and they want you to know that they'll try
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:30.200]  to audit you they'll want you to know that oh you'll be putting a list you're
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:34.640]  already on a list they're already shutting the country down we have no
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:39.880]  chance here ladies and gentlemen if we don't stand up and get involved now we
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:45.600]  have absolutely no future they want to break us fully and it is going to take
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:52.120]  people like Benjamin Smith who is getting active and getting aggressive and
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:57.640]  going out and speaking out and all of you have to be leaders and I agree with
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:02.360]  what he's saying people that are veterans especially and who aren't cowards and
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:06.640]  who understand we're in a military attack here we are under an economic and
[02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:11.080]  now political and then soon physical attack and that's why I want to like the
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:15.040]  police I want them to be honorable but they're in a command structure more and
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:19.800]  more that is authoritarian and authoritarianism is not liberty
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:24.760]  tyranny is not liberty oppression is not liberty the globalists have been all
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:27.480]  these horrible things worldwide in our name through all these different
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:32.800]  psyophrods now they're going to do it here and they are not going to stop folks
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.000]  they're going to carry out a Soviet style Sovietization like they did in
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:42.600]  Eastern Europe guaranteed guaranteed I mean I'm up here risking my life folks
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:45.720]  because I'm not going to run to some other country where they're putting the
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:50.880]  same thing in there I can't run and and that's why so many times people talk to
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:54.800]  me they go man you're scaring people you're helping the enemy and I don't
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:49:00.120]  really think that's true I really don't think that's true I mean if that's true
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:05.720]  then I'm really in a fool and I'm not I don't think I'm a fool I think I want to
[02:49:05.720 --> 02:49:08.880]  be told there's a robber trying to break in my garage by the neighbor calling me
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:11.960]  I don't want the neighbor go that was kind of scary I didn't call you let the
[02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:15.240]  guy home invade my house I mean the person's already trying to break in my
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:19.600]  house I want to know I don't want to hide under the bed and just imagine that
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:24.320]  it's not going on so I see people yeah they get scared hearing all this you
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:28.640]  should be scared of not getting aggressive and active you should be scared
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:32.200]  that you're not involved you should be scared because you're just giving these
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:38.240]  people free reign and so don't go off half cocked and go shoot up a threat

[02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:31.680]  they're anti-human exterminist they're on record and they think we're done they
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:35.000]  think they can beat us that's why they fund the radical Islamic groups they
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:40.280]  fund al-Qaeda on record it's why they stage a lot of the terror attacks or
[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:44.840]  provocateur the others so they could radically transform our society and have
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:49.040]  the military and police trained for open war with the American people and build
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:53.440]  secret police spy command centers tied into everything to federalize
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:57.800]  everything which is really under globalist control the good news is we
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:02.400]  learned about this a long time ago because military sources law enforcement
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:06.320]  sources had nobody to go to except soldier of fortune would write about it
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:12.400]  18 years ago and I would cover it Alex Jones and things like soldier of
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:17.240]  fortune and people like Mark Kornke that's about it and then we were the
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:21.400]  people oh they're the crazies they say all this is going on now it's all
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:26.520]  confirmed and I didn't know any of this stuff I was told by police chiefs and
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:32.280]  emergency managers and Navy SEALs and retired Delta Force people hey sonny
[02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:37.160]  you look like you're willing to do this go look into this because I was just
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:43.520]  crazy enough to go do it some of the stuff man where they took our footage a
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:46.240]  couple times that'd be some of those amazing footage ever they hadn't took
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:52.200]  it the point is is that I think about some of the stuff I've even told people
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:57.040]  about the point is is that we're not going to be hit flat-footed here I mean
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:00.600]  I've been running around like a chicken with my head cut off for 18 years and so
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:04.240]  a bunch of other people it's not like we don't know about this plan Clinton had
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:07.880]  the military doing litmus test will you fire Americans and that's why they were
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:12.640]  freaking out if the military is either gonna hang us or save us because you
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:16.600]  notice each time they want the military do the evil stuff the military says no
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:22.240]  so what they're doing is is they're just bringing in more and more bad people I'm
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.040]  gonna do a little bit overdrive to go to David and James and Antonio and Julian
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:29.920]  and others there's some big breaking news on info wars.com it's really
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:34.000]  bizarre that the head of Interpol says armed citizens worldwide to prevent
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:40.800]  terror attacks I mean that's just common sense but this guy's really doesn't fit
[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:44.560]  into the that articles up on info wars.com that doesn't really fit into the
[02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:49.760]  establishment idiocy so wow wouldn't just be nice to have any good leaders
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:53.840]  again who aren't total criminals just so so our economy's about building good
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:56.920]  things and having good culture instead of just corruption and government drug
[02:56:56.920 --> 02:57:01.720]  dealing and money laundering and evil and disarmed mega cities with poor
[02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:06.240]  pathetic slaves walking around getting their welfare checks and and and and

[02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:19.920]  folks like David who's been holding the next longest Sam and Antonio who knows
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:24.120]  I might do 20 minutes overdrive to get to everybody but there's a lot of other
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:29.040]  news that's up on info wars.com and prisonplot.com but the Democrats are

[03:00:24.520 --> 03:00:28.640]  to that kind of the next segment we're in overdrive we're live thank you for
[03:00:28.640 --> 03:00:34.560]  holding David in California you're on the air welcome hi Alex I've been
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:38.520]  wondering about a possible big solution I've been wondering if it's possible to
[03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:43.160]  make a mailing list to the top say hundred thousand influential people in
[03:00:43.160 --> 03:00:46.600]  the country fundraise a few hundred thousand and then mail them your
[03:00:46.600 --> 03:00:51.480]  upcoming DVD the Obama deception I've seen this kind of thing work these
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:54.720]  campaigns and other nonprofit organizations I'm just wondering about
[03:00:54.720 --> 03:00:58.200]  you're right I just don't know if I personally have the organizational skills
[03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:02.880]  I can probably partner with the folks that put out dreams of my real father I
[03:01:02.880 --> 03:01:07.200]  know they did something similar usually it's like films about being scared of
[03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:09.680]  Muslims but then they don't tell you that the government actually runs the
[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:14.200]  radical Muslims but I know that's been done a lot and then I would like to hit
[03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:18.640]  the hundred thousand influential authoritarian liberals because not all of
[03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:22.840]  them are consciously authoritarians and hit the so-called conservatives because
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:29.440]  you know we're always like hitting conservatives to wake them up but once
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:32.720]  the Republican gets in they'll put up with the very same tyranny I gotta say
[03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.400]  though with Obama I'm even amazed how bad it is I mean I I'm surprised he's
[03:01:37.400 --> 03:01:40.960]  gotten away with this much but I guess they've got NSA blackmail is the intel
[03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:45.880]  we've got but that's a great idea well if you ever need any help running that
[03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:49.320]  campaign I've done these before for other groups you can have me do it part-time
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:55.360]  here remote sir give us your give us your name and number and we'll try to give
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:02:00.200]  you Rob do's private email and send that yes that's what I need is help
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:04.480]  expertise because I'm busy trying to cover the news and research that and
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:08.120]  then I've got to run everything else but in fact I want to in fact I'm not
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:10.960]  doing a money bomb this year because we've we've been able to raise enough
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:14.640]  money with high quality products to be able to pay for the rollout the
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:17.920]  expansion and the TV stuff at least for now we're doing a little bit better than
[03:02:17.920 --> 03:02:21.120]  we were we've been cash strapped last year but we've done some other things
[03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:24.960]  brought in some new products that have helped us out I like the dash cams and
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:28.720]  the and the great nation iodine and the appropriate water filters and
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:35.280]  sponsorship and stuff so but but yes you know I gave a hundred thousand dollars
[03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:39.560]  to the winner of the films exposing the tyranny but I don't have the money to do
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:44.320]  that again we could probably do a fundraiser people would give to that to
[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:50.800]  say send five copies to every member of Congress and that would be you know I
[03:02:50.800 --> 03:02:56.800]  guess how many thousands that'd be like three thousand copies or so to send
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:03:01.760]  those to Congress and then maybe send some to all the members of all the
[03:03:01.760 --> 03:03:05.920]  state houses and that does have a big effect and then say send it that's a
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:10.160]  great idea how much will we need to raise to do that I think to send out
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:14.680]  about a hundred thousand DVDs at cost with all the shipping everything I'd
[03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:19.160]  probably have to raise I'd probably have to raise what five hundred thousand
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:24.520]  dollars how would that work well if you can get those out at wholesale cost then
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:29.840]  you can probably do it for one or two dollars per shipping and I don't need
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:33.640]  on them I've done these on a big scale I have a lot of experience on this I'd
[03:03:33.640 --> 03:03:36.720]  be more than happy to help you out on it I've worked with one group that had
[03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:40.080]  devastating results it's very effective you also want to get it out to
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:43.880]  police chiefs you want to get it out to educators you want to get out to colleges
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:48.160]  and universities you want to get it out maybe possibly even hospitals for the
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:51.600]  you know how do you do it that inexpensive I mean if I print 20,000 DVDs
[03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:56.240]  they're like 70 cents a piece I mean they say like the DVD the packaging you
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:00.960]  really think you can mail it out for two dollars a piece wow that's awesome so so
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:05.240]  we could fund that with a hundred fifty thousand dollars then yeah I've seen well
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:08.400]  the group I worked with actually purchased their own manufacturing
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:13.440]  equipment so they had really low rates on their manufacturing cost and it was
[03:04:13.440 --> 03:04:17.600]  an amazing campaign I'd be happy to run this off I tell you what sir send us
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:20.280]  your bio and that you've run these campaigns and we'll we'll try to work
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:24.520]  it out and hire you that absolutely I've thought about that for a decade and
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:28.480]  it's never had the money or the I'm too busy trying to make the film but yes
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:32.120]  that's what I want because instead of just putting it on YouTube and 20 million
[03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:35.680]  people see it and you know maybe 50,000 of our listeners buy a DVD at pace with
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:39.240]  the film which is great and they make copies give it to people we always have
[03:04:39.240 --> 03:04:43.240]  the copy thing where people can make copies that is a great idea I want to
[03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:48.800]  do it what's your I want to be public David what's your full name I sure go

[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.880]  the sites right now so make them even better we'll see what happens with
[03:08:20.880 --> 03:08:28.840]  infowars.com and prisonvoid.com getting into the other news that's out the
[03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:31.920]  New York Times is reporting on what I told you years ago the plan was because
[03:08:31.920 --> 03:08:35.600]  they were public about it on c-span security check now starts before you
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:40.160]  fly and they're going to use anything like claiming have it paid the IRS and
[03:08:40.160 --> 03:08:42.960]  I'll let you fly there's no judge there's no jury they'll just put you on a
[03:08:42.960 --> 03:08:47.040]  no-fly list so this is the total authoritarian enslavement and the New
[03:08:47.040 --> 03:08:50.960]  York Times reports on it like it's fun and safe and they're going to go through
[03:08:50.960 --> 03:08:55.600]  a wide array of government and private databases mainlining an NSA like car
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:09:00.560]  registrations and employment information so there's the mission creep of the
[03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:04.400]  new secret police toilet attendant group that is going to rule our lives and run
[03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:10.160]  checkpoints and if you make a joke about it they're going to arrest you so that is
[03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:16.240]  the word just total tyranny just bow down get ready and they're going to take
[03:09:16.240 --> 03:09:22.160]  your pension funds too and just worship them worship them continuing here with
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:33.560]  some of the other news that is coming out Ted Cruz is being attacked and the
[03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:42.560]  website is being run by Nigerian email scammers that's right and still no one is
[03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:47.960]  able to sign up for it people that say they have think they have so they go I
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:53.680]  signed up I'm getting in there I go oh yes so Cruz has Nigerian email scammers
[03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:57.560]  running Obamacare website and of course he's comparing it to that they're not
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:10:02.480]  actually doing it the glitches he compared it the glitches to the
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:07.480]  Nigerian email scammers which people still think is real by the way I talk
[03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:12.840]  about that a lot because that really is what it's like and by the way if you
[03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:18.640]  can't even sign up on it what happens once there's claims and I got to tell
[03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:22.560]  you Dr. Blalock six years ago when Obama was first elected or about to be
[03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:27.560]  elected he was president elect he said you watch and none of it's gonna work
[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:33.040]  it's designed to wreck everything and my dad is well not anymore he's phasing it
[03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:37.840]  out but he's 95% of it now is a healthcare consultant and he said no the
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:41.200]  way this is written you cannot take Medicare Medicaid and not break a law
[03:10:41.200 --> 03:10:45.320]  and actually come in and tell the big providers they go play ball and be our
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:50.440]  friends and do what we want and we won't indict you we won't take over
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:55.480]  everything right now just do what we say and people are like whoa man I'm I'm
[03:10:55.480 --> 03:10:59.120]  gonna retire early whoa they're like good that's what we want anyway get out
[03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:04.040]  of here and so I mean they're in there boy now they're over your records and
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:13.560]  over your money and the yeah they love it they love it don't complain about it
[03:11:13.560 --> 03:11:17.600]  or you're racist that Obama has now called up Verizon saying he wants them to
[03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:22.360]  fix it the Spanish websites completely down well I mean if you know who of it
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:27.400]  needs that the Spanish site is completely down let's click on that and
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:34.720]  show them that it's down and continuing here the world is spending 1 billion per
[03:11:34.720 --> 03:11:38.960]  day to tackle global warming that doesn't exist the world has a cool down
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:45.800]  there's a crop of a Ted Cruz candidates emerging in 2014 very exciting so they're
[03:11:45.800 --> 03:11:49.680]  demonizing him right now including from the Liberty Movement pointing out that
[03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:54.240]  his wife has worked in a division that has been connected to Goldman Sachs and
[03:11:54.240 --> 03:11:57.560]  we know he's a big corporate lawyer I care about how he votes to defend the
[03:11:57.560 --> 03:12:01.480]  Second Amendment how we barely beat stuff with his vote I care how he votes
[03:12:01.480 --> 03:12:05.520]  to defend our Republic and our sovereignty and not legalized 30 million
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:09.880]  illegals how he criticizes Obamacare and his filibusters and the minute Ted
[03:12:09.880 --> 03:12:14.040]  Cruz ever deviates off that then when his wife has done in the past will be a
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:17.000]  pertinence but they're now and I'm not saying it's bad to point out what his
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:21.520]  wife's doing we should watch it but that's why we didn't support him really
[03:12:21.520 --> 03:12:26.360]  up front when he was running for Senate we supported him over David Dewhurst
[03:12:26.360 --> 03:12:31.360]  because he's so horrible and we know he's bad with Gardasil and TSA groping us
[03:12:31.360 --> 03:12:35.160]  and blocking the state law on that so I supported him but held my nose with a
[03:12:35.160 --> 03:12:39.880]  proviso but I've really been watching Cruz closely and I like him I know ran
[03:12:39.880 --> 03:12:45.760]  Paul's good and look nobody is going to be perfect I don't play politics but they
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:48.920]  would have gotten their gun control if it wasn't for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and
[03:12:48.920 --> 03:12:53.800]  all of you out there so I'm just saying you know down the road if I find somebody
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:56.760]  better Ted Cruz or Rand Paul I'll support him over them even if it was
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:02.360]  somebody better good luck on that we got Diane Feinstein to deal with we got
[03:13:02.360 --> 03:13:08.280]  Joe Biden we got Michael Moore I mean these I knew this a long time ago but
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:13.560]  now I really know it I'm sure of it they are flaming authoritarians they know
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:20.040]  they're taking over they know they're evil they are gangsters following a
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:23.840]  psych war for a script they are pigs they are mercenaries they are globalist
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:30.160]  usurpers let's go ahead and go to a phone call Antonio in Texas thanks for
[03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:33.640]  holding you're on the air thank you
[03:13:33.640 --> 03:13:37.320]  doing all right brother go ahead all right hey I was just calling ask your
[03:13:37.320 --> 03:13:42.800]  opinion on something I I heard about a this comment ice on I don't know if you
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:46.760]  heard this is kind of drumming up a lot of things here but I'm like the
[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:52.400]  residents kind of conspiracy theorist and my brother-in-law called me just
[03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:55.920]  past weekend to have it hurting anything about it and I looked into it and
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:00.600]  honestly what I found out about it was there is a lot of propaganda going on
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:05.240]  there's a lot of hype this comment I found it's supposed to create this EMP
[03:14:05.240 --> 03:14:10.240]  blast and and what have you but and I just wanted to call it to really kind of
[03:14:10.240 --> 03:14:14.800]  be grateful for you because because I've been listening for so long you allowed
[03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:18.640]  me to really decipher some of the stuff that I've been that was hearing that you
[03:14:18.640 --> 03:14:22.240]  know because they have these hour-long things going on of how it really is kind
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:26.120]  of like 2012 into the world kind of stuff but I found this guy who is a
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:31.520]  natural physicist James McKenney who actually because of you I was able to
[03:14:31.520 --> 03:14:35.080]  decipher that this guy's actually has some truth and what he was saying is
[03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:39.800]  which I found very interesting is that the ice that comment is doing some
[03:14:39.800 --> 03:14:45.960]  crazy stuff in there it's approaching mercury and this upcoming drill that's
[03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:51.360]  going to be having in November is the same day that there that this comment is
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:56.760]  going to be approaching mercury and and going causing the the planet to go
[03:14:56.760 --> 03:15:01.000]  comment and after that he plunges into the sun and I believe what he is saying
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:09.160]  is that the government possibly could use this as an excuse to you know kind of
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:12.840]  shut things now sir listen I appreciate your call good points you know you sound
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:16.360]  really excited about this stuff and I would be too because we know if you look
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:19.360]  at the moon or you look at Earth from satellite there's craters everywhere and
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:23.320]  we get hit every hundred years or so by giant meteorites or asteroids
[03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:31.440]  comets but I don't think look look there's too many amateur astronomers
[03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:36.280]  are too many amateur astronomers they're watching everything it's amateur
[03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:43.000]  astronomers came it's talk now I'm so tired astronomers that are the ones
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:46.640]  that are finding almost all the comets and asteroids and things now not the
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:50.800]  radio telescopes none of it and it is a perennial book you can sell and I'm not
[03:15:50.800 --> 03:15:54.520]  saying we were even talking about some bad guy as I've heard him I think he's
[03:15:54.520 --> 03:15:59.080]  interesting and he might be right but I mean I have to every year tell someone
[03:15:59.080 --> 03:16:03.000]  no it's not Planet X no it's not the end of the world know this comment isn't
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:13.800]  gonna hit us no this isn't going to happen and I just think it's a bunch of
[03:16:13.800 --> 03:16:17.080]  hype now there's a comment coming in about a month they say maybe the biggest
[03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:21.280]  ever seen of an Ion I think is the name of it
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:27.000]  Ison and that's certainly interesting but and its tail may come across us and
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:30.480]  may blow out some satellites hell a comet might hit us and blow up like it did
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:34.960]  in the Yucatan Peninsula and throw up a shroud of dirt that kills the dinosaurs
[03:16:34.960 --> 03:16:39.720]  I don't know I mean I'm saying this stuff does happen but if there's some
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:43.720]  giant planetoid coming in or a comet or whatever you're gonna see it and a
[03:16:43.720 --> 03:16:49.040]  comet hitting a gas giant when they fit Jupiter and Saturn and things and have
[03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:55.520]  been observable it doesn't do anything to our weather it doesn't affect us but
[03:16:55.520 --> 03:17:03.600]  there you go Sam and Tennessee you're on the air go ahead hey Alex hey buddy yes
[03:17:03.600 --> 03:17:09.440]  on the share safety almost say exactly what county I worked in but really
[03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:13.680]  disturbing this year we had in service which we have to take every year and the
[03:17:13.680 --> 03:17:18.720]  part of Homeland Security come in to help with our in-service basically we
[03:17:18.720 --> 03:17:22.880]  had four hours of class with the part of Homeland Security and I don't want to sound
[03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:27.240]  racist or anything but there was no Muslim brotherhood there was about mixed
[03:17:27.240 --> 03:17:32.800]  cartels you know with black panthers or nothing it was basically what they was
[03:17:32.800 --> 03:17:37.280]  pointing out was that they was going after basically like the Tea Party people
[03:17:37.280 --> 03:17:42.720]  those keepers the Bob Bob Bursa tip to people and everything yes sir that is
[03:17:42.720 --> 03:17:47.720]  the that is the official manuals where all they they say the number one threat
[03:17:47.720 --> 03:17:52.440]  is returning veterans gun owners Ron Paul Rand Paul and then they use the
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:57.280]  IRS on us illegally when we're just Americans they are the criminals doing
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:02.440]  that show so how did that go over in your in-service training by the feds
[03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:08.480]  well I mean for us our all of our guys are chairs for we had some mad we was we
[03:18:08.480 --> 03:18:12.720]  were seeing red and it was all I could do to hope back a lot of questions and
[03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:16.920]  everything cuz you know that no no it's good you don't do anything because the
[03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:20.560]  feds are there assessing you during these meetings and a lot of the feds
[03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:24.000]  aren't bad people but the ones they send to those are Southern Brewery Law Center
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:28.920]  ADO operatives fifth column and I know this from the inside they are marking
[03:18:28.920 --> 03:18:34.200]  you in a file if you don't say you love communism basically go ahead yeah
[03:18:34.200 --> 03:18:37.760]  basically they set up like a gun show stuff and they're really after our
[03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:43.120]  second member rights and everything and they send the homeless security ATF agents
[03:18:43.120 --> 03:18:48.940]  up inside a gun show and they try to portray people to act out you know to
[03:18:48.940 --> 03:18:52.760]  try to get them to talk about the government to try to you know get people
[03:18:52.760 --> 03:18:57.360]  in you know how long say that again did you say they've got TSA people in the
[03:18:57.360 --> 03:19:04.840]  gun shows wow no it's more the the homeless security everything has a lot
[03:19:04.840 --> 03:19:08.400]  of people in a gun show they more to try to get people talking bad about the
[03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:11.880]  government to try to get them you know just to get people on the list and
[03:19:11.880 --> 03:19:15.080]  everything it's really a problem what they're doing with our second member
[03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:20.200]  right yeah what they are is their secret police going around trying to put
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:24.560]  people in databases good let's put all them in databases I mean let's expose
[03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:27.920]  the criminals that have seized our government that are saying that people
[03:19:27.920 --> 03:19:32.560]  that want to keep America free are bad I mean they've indicted themselves they
[03:19:32.560 --> 03:19:37.000]  are the villains and they think they're appealed authority because they're the
[03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:44.160]  establishment that then they're allowed to sit there in an army manual and say
[03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:47.720]  George Washington is bad this is disgusting and no you're right of
[03:19:47.720 --> 03:19:51.200]  course there's no Muslim brotherhood and there's no al-qaeda and stuff in there
[03:19:51.200 --> 03:19:56.320]  now because they're now they run those groups they now are moving over the
[03:19:56.320 --> 03:20:00.520]  communist that the global issues to take over have always been allied with the
[03:20:00.520 --> 03:20:04.920]  radical Muslims that is a fact and folks we're in the middle of a pincers
[03:20:04.920 --> 03:20:08.640]  attack here they want to play us off against normal Muslims who have nothing
[03:20:08.640 --> 03:20:11.800]  to do with this the really radical ones work for the globalist but let me shut
[03:20:11.800 --> 03:20:15.440]  up and have you make any other points from Tennessee as a sheriff's deputy
[03:20:15.440 --> 03:20:18.000]  that folks might want to know what's going on
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:24.440]  well at least let all the listeners know there's a lot of good county police officers out there
[03:20:24.440 --> 03:20:28.440]  there's a lot of good deputies out there that you know we took our oaths for the
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:32.600]  to defend the Constitution United States and that's what I'm going to do and the
[03:20:32.600 --> 03:20:37.360]  day they start having me go against the people of this great nation that we have
[03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:43.600]  or ask us to go and start taking people's guns the day that I turn my page in so
[03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:47.800]  well God bless you sir the problem is that day may be coming and look everybody
[03:20:47.800 --> 03:20:51.480]  shouldn't feel bad though if it comes to this or whatever we've got to do because
[03:20:51.480 --> 03:20:56.000]  we didn't start this we're not looking for it and we're not bad and I'm sick of
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:00.240]  hearing we're bad they're the bad people telling us we're guilty of something
[03:21:00.240 --> 03:21:05.120]  when statistically the real tea party the libertarians the constitutionalist
[03:21:05.120 --> 03:21:11.240]  and returning veterans have the lowest crime rate in this country and they know
[03:21:11.240 --> 03:21:15.960]  we're the good guys they're the bad guys I mean it's real simple they're the bad
[03:21:15.960 --> 03:21:20.120]  guys everything they do is evil saying we're bad I mean that's pretty cut and
[03:21:20.120 --> 03:21:28.760]  dry right there isn't it he's gone makes me sick I just that's why I've
[03:21:28.760 --> 03:21:33.320]  psychoanalyzed why I'm always blowing up because I'm not happy about this I'm
[03:21:33.320 --> 03:21:37.760]  not out looking for some fight with foreign banks that run giant death
[03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:44.040]  squads I'm not looking for five are you kidding man I was a libertarian
[03:21:44.040 --> 03:21:50.280]  constitutionalist mainline you know right-wing Republican who they were
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:54.800]  trying to ban guns in Texas most guns and ban junior shooting sports and I was
[03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:58.160]  only a few years out of high school and you know had been involved in stuff like
[03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:03.440]  that and and they were trying to get rid of property rights and I went and got
[03:22:03.440 --> 03:22:08.800]  involved and then I found out about everything else and we're you are the
[03:22:08.800 --> 03:22:16.120]  ones that are being usurped here and they are trying to wreck the country on
[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:20.120]  record and when I heard Dr. Blalock who's incredibly smart and involved in
[03:22:20.120 --> 03:22:23.680]  medical management and running a health health department at a major university
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:26.960]  when I heard a top brain surgeon he's invented a whole bunch of the most
[03:22:26.960 --> 03:22:31.960]  commonly used new procedures and brain surgery and he's a super brain surgeon
[03:22:31.960 --> 03:22:35.280]  and I remember him six years ago going they will bankrupt it none of it will
[03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:38.880]  work by design then they'll move to the next phase that guy has read like hundreds
[03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:43.480]  of books about communist history eugenics history and everything we got to get
[03:22:43.480 --> 03:22:47.920]  Blalock back on and I remember going come on they just want to socialize it
[03:22:47.920 --> 03:22:51.520]  to control people and have death panels they're not gonna totally wreck
[03:22:51.520 --> 03:22:56.280]  everything and he said no they want to blow out our political and financial
[03:22:56.280 --> 03:23:01.440]  engine they've almost already brought it and just it all came true I mean I don't
[03:23:01.440 --> 03:23:05.880]  blame the public for not believing this stuff because I can't believe it I can't
[03:23:05.880 --> 03:23:11.040]  believe it's declassified army manual bad-mouthing the founding fathers and
[03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:15.200]  saying you know they're preparing for war with the Tea Party so I don't blame
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:19.600]  anybody for not believing us okay I don't blame you and let me tell you
[03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:23.320]  something I don't blame you for thinking I'm a liar that that vaccines have
[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:27.280]  quote adverse effects because they say on the news they have no side effects when
[03:23:27.280 --> 03:23:31.760]  the insert says they can kill you I don't blame you think that I'm a liar
[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:35.120]  because when you find out they're lying to you you're gonna have to rethink
[03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:42.160]  everything let's go ahead and take a phone call James and Florida thanks for
[03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:49.520]  holding her on the air hello hey buddy hey Alex I'm a younger listener I'm
[03:23:49.520 --> 03:23:53.520]  nineteen years old and I've been listening to your show for about six
[03:23:53.520 --> 03:23:56.720]  months now and I've been awake for about a year and I just want to give you a
[03:23:56.720 --> 03:24:01.880]  little insight on the younger community that's like growing up in this age of
[03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:07.760]  globalism and how we're all being suppressed by like the college and stuff
[03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:14.400]  everybody in the education system is just pushing down just liberalism in
[03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:19.480]  general as far asarianism because you're their food see they've told all the
[03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:23.320]  yuppies and and people and all the baby boomers you're gonna have to enslave
[03:24:23.320 --> 03:24:26.080]  because there's less of them than there are the baby boomers you're gonna have
[03:24:26.080 --> 03:24:29.960]  to enslave the young people to pay for all your giant pensions and stuff of
[03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:34.760]  course the bankers are gonna steal all that because they want to politically
[03:24:34.760 --> 03:24:38.080]  control people they've done this in other countries we know where we are on
[03:24:38.080 --> 03:24:41.640]  the program I mean it's like we're reading a movie script or something or a
[03:24:41.640 --> 03:24:48.280]  program at a at a play we know what's coming up next in Romeo and Juliet we
[03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:52.120]  know what's coming up next so yes sir and it's the young people bamboozled by
[03:24:52.120 --> 03:24:57.280]  the young trendy hip black president when he's not even really black in my view
[03:24:57.280 --> 03:25:03.880]  more like some space alien you know yuppie or something and he's there just
[03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:07.920]  ramming this down as the front man and they're all dancing feeling trendy and
[03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:12.240]  stuff having no idea they're being set up but go ahead I'm sorry I'm ranting I
[03:25:12.240 --> 03:25:17.400]  agree with you full-heartedly but there are people that are starting to see what's
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:23.720]  going on Mike it's just obvious now the propaganda and the textbooks are getting
[03:25:23.720 --> 03:25:27.000]  really bad in my textbook for this government class I'm taking this
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:31.320]  semester it's going over the bill of rights and where it comes to the second
[03:25:31.320 --> 03:25:35.560]  amendment it's all just propaganda about school shootings it doesn't even go over
[03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:39.240]  the second amendment it just talks about shootings that have happened with guns
[03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:44.720]  it's quite what they do is they create the perception of mass shootings
[03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:50.160]  increasing when mass shootings even adding gang related are slightly up the
[03:25:50.160 --> 03:25:57.600]  last 10 years down since 1992 but overall crime with gun is down 49% so so the
[03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:02.160]  truth is overall people using guns and criminal activity home invasions car
[03:26:02.160 --> 03:26:07.560]  jackings every other major crime car jackings are down over 80% nationwide
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:10.840]  look it up you know why because they know people are packing you know where
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:15.360]  they're up Chicago New York DC man if I lived in DC I'd be breaking the law all
[03:26:15.360 --> 03:26:22.480]  day I mean it's better to be you know tried by nine than you know buried by
[03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:32.360]  buried by six what's the saying it's yeah exactly I mean it's better I mean I'm

[03:27:01.400 --> 03:27:05.800]  young you're gonna wake up and be an old man and all you young people see what
[03:27:05.800 --> 03:27:10.240]  anybody who's older is up here saying and they go that's some old guy with that
[03:27:10.240 --> 03:27:15.880]  gravelly voice not an old guy I'm just a human being just like you I bet I know
[03:27:15.880 --> 03:27:21.200]  how to have more fun than you do let's go ahead and talk to Julie and in Texas
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:27.400]  you're on the air go ahead Alex hey buddy hey man how's it going pretty good my
[03:27:27.400 --> 03:27:31.080]  friend go ahead I just wanted to say I appreciate everything you're doing I
[03:27:31.080 --> 03:27:34.000]  know the extra time you're putting into this all the time you take to talk to
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:40.320]  everybody and stuff but I wanted to point out something you talk about GMOs
[03:27:40.320 --> 03:27:48.960]  right yes sir okay you are what you eat basically H.E.B. is a big supermarket
[03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:52.560]  basically in Texas I'm pretty sure you know that right yes absolutely it
[03:27:52.560 --> 03:27:57.560]  stands for Howard E. Butts yeah and I'm not sure if anybody's brought this point
[03:27:57.560 --> 03:28:03.400]  up but I was gonna bring the idea of starting a petition to have GMOs
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:07.760]  labeled in H.E.B. because I agree I agree because we can't get it done at the
[03:28:07.760 --> 03:28:13.000]  state level anywhere because of lobby those companies to make it more clear
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:18.480]  and better that's a great idea yeah and I live in a small town just 20 minutes
[03:28:18.480 --> 03:28:22.200]  away from Brownsville it's called Harlingen and all we have is a Walmart
[03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:26.840]  and an H.E.B. here and a Costco is being built and I'm pretty sure H.E.B. I mean
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:31.400]  Walmart is filling us crap you know there's no doubt H.E.B. is better than
[03:28:31.400 --> 03:28:36.480]  then Walmart God bless you I gotta jump by the way my grandmother was asked out
[03:28:36.480 --> 03:28:42.200]  by Howard E. Butts that owns that giant chain at Baylor University and did not
[03:28:42.200 --> 03:28:48.640]  do it and I'm glad she didn't or I would not exist instead she decided to go out
[03:28:48.640 --> 03:28:53.040]  with the with the football player from the University of Texas so who was
[03:28:53.040 --> 03:28:57.520]  roommateing with the Tom Landry isn't that weird oh it's a small world man
