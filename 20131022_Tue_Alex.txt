[00:00:04.827 --> 00:00:09.651]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:12.794]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.997]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:21.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:42.199]  It's such old news, but still incredibly important news for our listeners.
[00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:51.625]  It won't be breaking, but I never even mentioned it yesterday because of that, but to see the Washington Times and other old-time establishment media
[00:00:53.661 --> 00:01:01.707]  Reporting headlines like Navy SEAL family say helicopter crash was inside job.
[00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:10.314]  To see that headline and to see it getting coverage was simply, simply amazing.
[00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:15.138]  We've got a Navy SEAL coming on the broadcast today.
[00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.234]  Not to talk about that subject, but to talk about being at the events last week when the World War II vets and others pulled down the barricades.
[00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:33.601]  He said he believed they're trying to push veterans into striking at the criminal government as a false flag so they can roll out some type of civil war against the American people.
[00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:35.362]  That is exactly what's going on.
[00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:52.773]  And so we look forward to the highly decorated Navy SEAL, retired, Benjamin Smith, joining us coming up in the, I was checking the time he's on, coming up in the third hour today.
[00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:54.494]  He'll be joining us via telephone.
[00:01:54.494 --> 00:01:57.376]  I'd like to get him in here in person or via Skype, but he's on the roads.
[00:01:57.376 --> 00:01:59.939]  He'll be joining us coming up in T-minus two hours.
[00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:09.212]  If I sound a little bit out of it today, my voice is still a little bit blown from Saturday getting excited at the Alamo at the Open Carry March.
[00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:16.094]  And then, I don't have a lot of back problems, but it goes out my lower back a couple times a year, especially when I'm trying to get back in shape and jog.
[00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:17.675]  I don't stretch enough.
[00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:24.097]  But then I made the mistake when my back was hurting yesterday to go out with John McAfee and shoot 50 cows handheld.
[00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:30.232]  Uh, which you don't think is that big of a kick, but we were like shooting 10 rounds at a time.
[00:02:30.232 --> 00:02:38.137]  And actually hitting targets about 150 yards away, just handheld by line of sight with tracers shooting dead trees.
[00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:39.959]  It's pretty amazing footage.
[00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.560]  Nobody's ever seen McAvee shoot.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.161]  There's lots of footage of him with guns.
[00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:53.588]  And he did a spoof video of him like Tony Montana, you know, a comedy video with women all around him and cocaine on his face, which was a joke video he put out.
[00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:55.229]  The media runs it like it's real.
[00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.751]  I mean, like when I dressed up like the Joker one time to do a spoof video.
[00:03:00.751 --> 00:03:03.832]  They say I really think I'm the Joker and I'm crazy.
[00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:08.133]  But he's never before been seen firing guns.
[00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.413]  It'll be pretty viral.
[00:03:10.413 --> 00:03:13.714]  And also interesting what he had to say about the Second Amendment and more.
[00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:15.035]  John McAfee's definitely a character.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.342]  He just left Austin this morning.
[00:03:18.342 --> 00:03:22.846]  But that footage will be out tomorrow night, because there's a bunch of it.
[00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:25.428]  And we're going to put it all together and edit it together nice.
[00:03:25.428 --> 00:03:31.193]  But tonight on the Nightly News, we will have some excerpts of some other interviews I did with John McAfee.
[00:03:31.193 --> 00:03:36.057]  And so that is coming up on InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[00:03:36.057 --> 00:03:39.741]  But side issue, I only shot like 50 rounds out of the Barretts.
[00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:46.750]  I forgot to do what I've always wanted to do is shoot two at the same time, just for fun.
[00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.632]  We didn't do that because we didn't bring enough ammo.
[00:03:49.632 --> 00:03:56.798]  By the time I wanted to do that, we'd gone through, I don't know, 100 rounds of ammo or whatever it was and 10 clips we already preloaded.
[00:03:56.798 --> 00:04:01.181]  But we do have John McAfee firing a .50 cal from the hip.
[00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:12.529]  In fact, one time we were shooting at cow feeders, old cow feeders, old plastic cow feeder buckets at 300 yards away with tracers.
[00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:16.929]  And of course, it was broad daylight, so you would just see almost like a white line.
[00:04:16.929 --> 00:04:22.290]  But with line of sight, he actually hit one of the feeders from the hip.
[00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.211]  The feeder's about two feet tall, about two feet wide, little yellow feeder.
[00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:29.972]  He actually hit it at like 300 yards, firing from the hip.
[00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:30.892]  Talk about a video game.
[00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:32.413]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:34.473]  I mean, that is just awesome!
[00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:36.755]  I'm now addicted to firing 50s from the hip.
[00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.216]  The problem is, is I can't walk today.
[00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:43.357]  I made the joke, this is my back therapy is shooting the 50.
[00:04:43.357 --> 00:04:46.839]  Well, no, it's not back therapy.
[00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.920]  I'm now, like, twisted, so I don't know.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.820]  Pull it up with me today.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.021]  I feel like I have ice picks being jammed in my back.
[00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:54.102]  We got big news, serious news.
[00:04:54.102 --> 00:04:55.163]  Straight ahead, stay with us.

[00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:08.612]  Financial experts are certain that within 12 to 36 months, the American economy will collapse, pushing most Americans into terrifying poverty, like third-world slums.
[00:06:08.612 --> 00:06:21.058]  Facing this unstoppable horror and knowing so many are unprepared, a group of military vets, engineers, survival experts, and a former FBIC bank inspector pooled their knowledge and experience to create LocustsontheHorizon.com.

[00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:20.482]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:27.109]  Benjamin Smith, a famous, highly decorated former Navy SEAL, thinks the government's trying to start a civil war.
[00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:28.810]  He's going to be joining us coming up.
[00:08:29.904 --> 00:08:37.508]  In the third hour today, it is already Tuesday, the 22nd day of October, 2013.
[00:08:37.508 --> 00:08:40.929]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.551]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:46.272]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:08:46.272 --> 00:08:46.792]  to 2 p.m.
[00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:52.215]  Central, back weeknights with the InfoWars Nightly News with myself and the rest of the great team.
[00:08:53.277 --> 00:08:54.738]  Wow, where to start?
[00:08:54.738 --> 00:09:14.490]  I want to just explain something to new listeners who tune in to the broadcast and may be asking, you know, why are we saying that we're going into a collapse and how do we know that there is going to be a collapse?
[00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.251]  How do we know that?
[00:09:16.377 --> 00:09:37.953]  Well, we know that they have created over a thousand trillion in derivatives, they have connected the world economy to that, infected all the major pension funds, infected all the government systems and corporate systems, and are maneuvering the answer to that crisis being a planetary world government.
[00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:44.458]  So, that is the reason that we point out that we don't know exactly how this accelerated collapse
[00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:46.174]  I don't know.
[00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:24.306]  This global crisis that they have created to bring in their world government.
[00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:31.090]  So we're going to be obviously continuing to break all of that down today.
[00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.593]  Hey, I'm good guys.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.801]  I'm good.
[00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:37.361]  I'm good in here.
[00:10:37.361 --> 00:10:38.342]  It was no big deal.
[00:10:38.342 --> 00:10:45.768]  Just somebody strung the phone cord up underneath my desk and so it got knocked off the hook, so I just fixed it.
[00:10:45.768 --> 00:10:49.551]  So not a big deal.
[00:10:49.551 --> 00:11:02.521]  But continuing here, Obamacare obviously is designed to implode.
[00:11:04.369 --> 00:11:11.212]  The rest of the economy and our journey towards basic sovietization will be complete.
[00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:16.455]  And homeland security is publicly set up to mop up the American people.
[00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:27.923]  It is publicly shut up to shut up a domestic surveillance grid and a secret police grid to wage war against the people.
[00:11:27.923 --> 00:11:32.607]  And that's why the police, more and more, act in an imperious nature.
[00:11:32.607 --> 00:11:40.053]  And I'm going to get into the world news here in a moment, but I wanted to first talk about something I saw driving into work
[00:11:41.064 --> 00:11:44.168]  Last Wednesday, it had been raining very hard.
[00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:53.259]  It had stopped raining, but I saw a black unmarked police car, completely t-boned, surrounded by state police and others, right in front of a big church.
[00:11:54.838 --> 00:12:07.568]  Uh, where police, uh, a month before had run our nanny off the road in a bunch of other cars, uh, just driving around everyone, uh, and then coming over into the lane.
[00:12:07.568 --> 00:12:12.772]  It was funny because they caused a wreck there about a month before, uh, that almost killed some people.
[00:12:12.772 --> 00:12:18.676]  I don't know what happened to this poor officer, uh, but, uh, there he was and I thought, wow, I bet he's in bad shape.
[00:12:18.676 --> 00:12:20.558]  Well, he died.
[00:12:20.558 --> 00:12:21.038]  He died.
[00:12:21.038 --> 00:12:23.300]  And then yesterday I was driving into work.
[00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:26.525]  And normally it takes me 45 minutes.
[00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:36.571]  It took me about an hour and 15 minutes because all the way up the highway, 290, were four or five motorcycle cops at every intersection.
[00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:38.572]  And they were standing out in the medians.
[00:12:38.572 --> 00:12:40.273]  And sometimes the traffic would stop.
[00:12:40.273 --> 00:12:46.737]  So my car stopped right in front of the motorcycle police after about an hour of driving.
[00:12:46.737 --> 00:12:50.459]  And I said, I said, hi, officer, what's going on?
[00:12:51.781 --> 00:12:53.704]  And he yelled at me, keep moving.
[00:12:53.704 --> 00:12:59.692]  This is while my car was stopped and he was five feet angled out standing in the median.
[00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:03.750]  And bugged his eyes out at me like he wanted to club my head in.
[00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:11.595]  So then I got my video camera out, my iPhone, and I said, well, when I get to this next group, rolling at half a mile an hour, you know, stop and go, I'll ask them.
[00:13:11.595 --> 00:13:14.537]  So I get up to the next group, and they didn't act like they wanted to kill me.
[00:13:14.537 --> 00:13:18.380]  They just said, don't worry about it, because after all, I just supply tax money.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.181]  I'm a blood bag for the government.
[00:13:20.181 --> 00:13:22.303]  I mean, I'm just here to supply blood to the mosquito government.
[00:13:25.297 --> 00:13:32.859]  And then they saw me filming and as I rolled by were like looking completely angry and completely upset like and their mouths were hanging up.
[00:13:32.859 --> 00:13:35.580]  In fact, I even have video of this because I swung the iPhone back.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.161]  Maybe I should put a piece together.
[00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:43.003]  They were so amazed that I would even talk to them because they're so used to the general public.
[00:13:43.003 --> 00:13:46.264]  It's got to be one of the most cowardly populations in human history.
[00:13:46.264 --> 00:13:47.404]  The opposite of our founders.
[00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:51.222]  They see cops they grovel.
[00:13:51.222 --> 00:13:54.083]  I mean if a cop gets behind somebody they start weaving and freak out and panic.
[00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:58.365]  I mean people see cops they fall down in fear.
[00:13:58.365 --> 00:13:59.926]  On average now.
[00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:06.288]  And I remember like 10 years ago in places like New York City I would say, hi officer do you know where such-and-such subway entrance is?
[00:14:06.288 --> 00:14:08.429]  And they would scream, do I look like a phone book?
[00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:13.866]  Now, not all New York police are like that.
[00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:14.827]  I know a lot of them are listeners.
[00:14:14.827 --> 00:14:16.328]  I run into some nice ones when I've been there.
[00:14:16.328 --> 00:14:19.571]  But a lot of them are just imperious thugs.
[00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:25.878]  Just like the TSA ad last year said, we want to hire imperious people that are domineering.
[00:14:25.878 --> 00:14:34.987]  And I guess the definition of imperious is arrogantly domineering, in people's face, unreasonably commanding.
[00:14:36.172 --> 00:14:39.354]  That's what the big foreign banks that run America are like.
[00:14:39.354 --> 00:14:41.515]  And so that's the attitude they're pushing for.
[00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:46.197]  A warrior class of police who don't fight with the drug gangs and the big banks that launder the money.
[00:14:46.197 --> 00:14:49.859]  They only go after the low-level drug gangs that don't launder the money properly.
[00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:54.181]  And they're just there to generate revenue and do all these home invasions and all the rest of it.
[00:14:54.181 --> 00:14:54.761]  Imperious.
[00:14:54.761 --> 00:15:02.044]  Having or showing the proud and unpleasant attitude of someone who gives orders and expects other people to obey them.
[00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:02.585]  Benefiting
[00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:09.325]  Are befitting a characteristic of one of imminent rank or attainments.
[00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:13.887]  Marked by arrogant assurance.
[00:15:13.887 --> 00:15:15.668]  Boy, are those not the definitions.
[00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:17.429]  And again, I did this as a test.
[00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:23.272]  Plus, I was on the phone with Watson in between the hour I was just in this particular piece of traffic.
[00:15:23.272 --> 00:15:29.475]  And I said, I think it's either going to be the President at a fundraiser, or it's going to be a police officer funeral.
[00:15:30.572 --> 00:15:31.993]  And I said, I'll see when I get to the office.
[00:15:31.993 --> 00:15:40.859]  When I got here, sure enough, at 11 o'clock, he was set to come down that road in the procession.
[00:15:40.859 --> 00:15:51.646]  So at 9 o'clock in the morning, they had all these motorcycle cops out there just preparing to shut down one of the most choked points of 71-290.
[00:15:53.966 --> 00:15:56.188]  Uh, Ben White in Austin, Texas.
[00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:58.589]  And again, I think the guy should have a nice send-off or whatever.
[00:15:58.589 --> 00:16:01.792]  They want to have a parade for him or whatever or something like that.
[00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:07.456]  My issue is he died hydroplaning, driving in to be on duty.
[00:16:07.456 --> 00:16:08.877]  Not even on duty is what I was reading.
[00:16:09.955 --> 00:16:14.418]  And he hydroplaned like thousands of people do every year and die.
[00:16:14.418 --> 00:16:25.246]  And I'm surprised they didn't just line up some citizens and execute them or maybe give him a Viking burial and just pile up some random citizens on a Viking ship and set us all on fire.
[00:16:25.246 --> 00:16:30.029]  That's how the Vikings would do it when a muckety-muck would die, just to show they were more important than other people.
[00:16:30.029 --> 00:16:32.931]  They would burn maybe their whole household women with them.
[00:16:34.591 --> 00:16:41.554]  I guess nobody else wanted to be around the elitist spoiled women, so that's kind of maybe a good Viking custom to burn all them up.
[00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:44.915]  I'm being a little sarcastic, but I'm sure.
[00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:48.016]  Odin says we must burn his women, yes.
[00:16:48.016 --> 00:16:50.297]  All the spoiled, rotten, nobles women.
[00:16:50.297 --> 00:16:53.278]  Yes, you will now be burned.
[00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.418]  I'm sorry.
[00:16:54.418 --> 00:16:57.600]  Anyways, can you imagine how spoiled noblemen's women are?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.101]  The point is, is that they didn't used to do stuff like this.
[00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:03.762]  When that Navy SEAL Chris Kyle died,
[00:17:06.681 --> 00:17:13.147]  They shut down I-35 for like four or five hours, the most busy stretch of highway in the country.
[00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:15.990]  It was like Jesus Christ had returned or something.
[00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.273]  And we went and covered his funeral, and I'm sad he's dead.
[00:17:19.273 --> 00:17:24.918]  I do think the guy was obviously a brave person, but it's so over the top.
[00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:29.462]  This is the kind of stuff you see in North Korea, when you have this type of martial ceremony
[00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:37.187]  But this cop didn't die going in to free women and children who had a kidnapper with them, who then got killed trying to stop them.
[00:17:37.187 --> 00:17:39.228]  Then you shut down the highway.
[00:17:39.228 --> 00:17:45.071]  Then, I think citizens would want to come out and line the road for an example of a citizen that did a good job.
[00:17:45.071 --> 00:17:52.395]  I got a couple examples here of preachers going in dollar stores and thieves are pistol-whipping women and then the preacher takes them out.
[00:17:52.395 --> 00:17:54.136]  Does that guy get any type of parade?
[00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:55.217]  I think he should get a parade too.
[00:17:55.777 --> 00:18:03.823]  I think when firefighters go into a burning building and save kids and then it collapses when they go back in to save more, I think you need a parade for that.
[00:18:03.823 --> 00:18:04.723]  That's where this comes from.
[00:18:04.723 --> 00:18:09.387]  You get a parade for being a hero.
[00:18:09.387 --> 00:18:15.591]  But now there's just the idea of you get a parade because you are a cop and that makes you the highest level hero.
[00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:21.896]  I mean, why not give everybody in the Army the Congressional Medal of Honor, not just give it to Audie Murphy?
[00:18:23.928 --> 00:18:27.830]  I don't think Audie Murphy, in fact I was looking it up this morning, couldn't find anything on it.
[00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:40.757]  I don't think he got a parade like this, and the guy at one setting killed like 55 German soldiers in a battle in Germany, and he'd already been in a whole bunch of stuff just like that.
[00:18:40.757 --> 00:18:50.903]  On top of tank destroyer for an hour, with the tank destroyer on fire with his feet burning, with bullets in his hip and chest and everything else, because he didn't like his buddies getting killed.
[00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:54.926]  I mean, Audie Murphy did not get what this cop got.
[00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:57.248]  I mean, that's all I'm saying.
[00:18:57.248 --> 00:18:57.748]  I just don't get it.
[00:18:57.748 --> 00:18:58.609]  I'm sad he's dead.
[00:18:58.609 --> 00:18:59.069]  My God.
[00:18:59.069 --> 00:19:03.152]  Every time my wife drives off with my kids, especially when it's raining, I say, drive slow.
[00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:04.593]  Hydroplaning is super dangerous.
[00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:05.914]  I felt bad when I drove by.
[00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:12.939]  When I saw that cop's car deboned, just like it was a citizen, I thought, man, I hope that person's all right.
[00:19:12.939 --> 00:19:14.080]  But then I went, wait a minute.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:21.841]  They ran our nanny off the road in three other cars, and the cops got in their face when they showed up, making excuses for it.
[00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:23.222]  Cops without their lights on.
[00:19:23.222 --> 00:19:35.484]  I think she said like six of them, drove down the median on 290, cut in front of the car in front of her, almost hitting him, and then ran those cars off the road.
[00:19:35.484 --> 00:19:38.705]  And there was a big car pile up.
[00:19:38.705 --> 00:19:40.025]  And it's like, oh, you're just a peasant.
[00:19:40.025 --> 00:19:40.365]  Big deal.
[00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:41.846]  Well, you know what that reckless driving?
[00:19:41.846 --> 00:19:42.986]  Gets people killed, doesn't it?
[00:19:44.304 --> 00:19:48.310]  So, my point is, the very spot where they ran our nanny off the road, this guy's dead.
[00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:52.275]  And then a week later, they got the whole road shut down like Caesar got killed.
[00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:55.039]  And I just, it doesn't make sense is all I'm saying.
[00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.521]  Alright, we're gonna be right back.
[00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:58.283]  But that was Officer Clay Crabb.
[00:19:58.283 --> 00:19:59.725]  Died October 16th.
[00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:03.628]  This is an emergency essentials sale.

[00:20:39.323 --> 00:20:40.124]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.124 --> 00:20:46.287]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:49.970]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:14.511]  Men who were formerly taking ED medication are now reporting that a secret underground video has restored their male performance better than pills.
[00:21:14.511 --> 00:21:22.977]  These men say this secret underground video is bringing back the male performance and sensation they've been missing for years and it's working better than pills.
[00:21:22.977 --> 00:21:24.579]  Things are so much better now.
[00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:27.000]  Everything kinda came back overnight.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.442]  My girlfriend is very happy.
[00:21:29.562 --> 00:21:33.043]  I purchased your product yesterday and it was fantastic.
[00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:36.924]  I have used your system for about three weeks and I'm already seeing great results.
[00:21:36.924 --> 00:21:43.305]  The owner of this video has reported the overwhelming bandwidth costs may necessitate his taking this video down.

[00:21:59.389 --> 00:22:03.692]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[00:22:03.692 --> 00:22:09.577]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.

[00:22:15.381 --> 00:22:18.904]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.

[00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:01.440]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:14.447]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:23:15.487 --> 00:23:17.429]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:19.630]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:26.036]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:23:26.036 --> 00:23:34.642]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:23:34.642 --> 00:23:40.087]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:23:40.327 --> 00:23:47.274]  To get your FAKE TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to FAKETV.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:23:47.274 --> 00:23:47.554]  That's 877-532-5388.
[00:23:47.554 --> 00:23:48.274]  Or go to FAKETV.com.
[00:23:48.274 --> 00:23:50.416]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:24:23.237 --> 00:24:23.339]  Yes.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.600]  All right, we're back, folks.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.461]  I want to open the phones up for listeners to talk about all the different things that are happening out there.
[00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:39.283]  The government shutdown, what a fraud that was, what happened with the debt increase, what's happening to the dollar.
[00:24:39.283 --> 00:24:42.383]  We wake up and the national debt's gone up a trillion dollars.
[00:24:42.383 --> 00:24:45.784]  Now they're talking about making it go up a trillion dollars a month.
[00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:47.524]  I've got those headlines here.
[00:24:47.524 --> 00:24:53.246]  Now that they've got an unlimited debt increase, at least in the next year, that's the name of the game.
[00:24:55.186 --> 00:24:56.507]  The United States.
[00:24:56.507 --> 00:25:03.931]  Wreck it, so the venture capitalist, the vulture capitalist, who are anti-free market, can come in and pick its bones.
[00:25:03.931 --> 00:25:04.932]  I mean, it's so simple.
[00:25:04.932 --> 00:25:07.373]  These are ruthless people.
[00:25:07.373 --> 00:25:11.175]  And if we'll allow them to engage in all these crimes, we're going to be up the creek.
[00:25:11.175 --> 00:25:13.336]  Without a paddle, as they say.
[00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:19.500]  And again, the police are so paramilitary now, that just ten years ago,
[00:25:20.714 --> 00:25:25.057]  The police officers I knew in Austin, Texas were different than they are now.
[00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:29.921]  And a cop by himself will be one of the nicest people you can talk to sitting around watching a football game.
[00:25:29.921 --> 00:25:32.003]  Or going fishing with, or hunting with.
[00:25:32.003 --> 00:25:34.645]  Believe me, I've gone hunting and fishing with plenty of cops in my life.
[00:25:34.645 --> 00:25:36.586]  Got a lot of them that are family.
[00:25:36.586 --> 00:25:41.130]  But you get them in their mob psychology groups, they are dangerous.
[00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.110]  More and more.
[00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.872]  And arrogant and imperious.
[00:25:43.872 --> 00:25:45.813]  And that's anti-American.
[00:25:45.813 --> 00:25:46.494]  And it's shameful.
[00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:53.889]  And there's this idea that our public servants can be armed, but we, the so-called masters, can't be.
[00:25:53.889 --> 00:25:55.130]  Well, we're not really the masters.
[00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.770]  We are civilians.
[00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.751]  We are slaves.
[00:25:57.751 --> 00:26:00.953]  They are the paramilitary group that rules the country.
[00:26:00.953 --> 00:26:05.035]  And I've known this since I read Rand Corporation documents back in the 90s, and since I...
[00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:24.871]  Read those documents and went to urban warfare drills and also was warned by good police officers and good military men who knew that this was part of a covert, long-term strategy to convert our country from a free, due process nation to a banana republic.
[00:26:24.871 --> 00:26:26.793]  There is almost nowhere in the world
[00:26:28.283 --> 00:26:36.338]  Except for the United States, Switzerland, and a couple other countries where you can really somewhat outright own your property and not just have government come along and take it.
[00:26:37.458 --> 00:26:47.520]  And now they're starting to do that here, with environmental eminent domain, corporate eminent domain, where they don't even pay you five cents on the dollar what your property's worth.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:57.742]  You can have the tax receipts of what you pay in property tax, and they say, sorry, the city has ruled, and you've seen all these New Haven, Connecticut cases and the rest of it.
[00:26:57.742 --> 00:27:05.163]  We've had famous cases like Gore Seafood on the Texas coast, where they just take your property and say, you know what we're gonna give you?
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.021]  We're going to give you nothing.
[00:27:08.021 --> 00:27:09.703]  How's that sound?
[00:27:09.703 --> 00:27:12.165]  And then you go, but my house is worth $500,000.
[00:27:12.165 --> 00:27:13.426]  The tax receipt shows.
[00:27:13.426 --> 00:27:13.906]  Doesn't matter.
[00:27:13.906 --> 00:27:15.027]  We're just taking it.
[00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:20.232]  And if you fight us, we're going to charge you for our lawyer fees in the court battle.
[00:27:23.066 --> 00:27:42.456]  Texas landowners, it's the Texas Bill of Rights, Land Rover Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights they passed a few years ago, I guess six years ago in the State House, actually says they can tell you now they're going to put a pipeline on your property, or drill on your property, or do whatever they want on your property, or build a road on your property, and you have no right to refuse.
[00:27:42.456 --> 00:27:45.478]  You get like six months to agree with them, and if you don't they just take it.
[00:27:45.478 --> 00:27:49.140]  It's kind of like the Don Corleone
[00:27:50.393 --> 00:27:55.215]  Godfather thing, where either your brains or your signature are going to be on this contract.
[00:27:55.215 --> 00:28:00.537]  Well, we're going to take your property if you don't give it to us.
[00:28:00.537 --> 00:28:12.462]  And my point is, by every yardstick, and no sociologist, no anthropologist, no historian denies this, they have Wall Street Journal articles, CNN even admits it, we are now a police state.
[00:28:12.462 --> 00:28:17.744]  And a police state has not really even much to do with the cops themselves, but with the due process being in the toilet.
[00:28:20.086 --> 00:28:26.190]  I mean, you're in a police state where they can take your kids for not taking vaccines, and there's no law saying you gotta take vaccines.
[00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:33.494]  You're in a police state where people are afraid to come to Texas, I know, because they see all the news articles about the cops will pull you over and you got $1,000 in your wallet.
[00:28:33.494 --> 00:28:37.137]  They'll just take it and say it's drug money with no proof.
[00:28:38.832 --> 00:28:47.195]  America is becoming like Mexico, or like an African country, or like a corrupt Caribbean nation.
[00:28:47.195 --> 00:28:48.815]  And I don't want to live in Belize.
[00:28:48.815 --> 00:28:50.976]  I don't want to live in Nigeria.
[00:28:50.976 --> 00:28:54.397]  I don't want to live in Saudi Arabia.
[00:28:54.397 --> 00:28:55.978]  I want to live in the United States.
[00:28:55.978 --> 00:29:00.879]  And so, I read the Homeland Security documents that are public, and it says I'm bad.
[00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:01.739]  Well, of course I'm bad.
[00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.600]  I'm against a criminal takeover.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.361]  I'm against a bank robbery of our rights and our liberties and our money.
[00:29:08.064 --> 00:29:11.665]  And I'm legitimately freaked out when I try to talk to cops.
[00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:14.905]  I didn't stop and talk to cops where I was rolling through.
[00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:23.227]  There were so many cops shutting this road down, or getting ready to shut it down, that repeatedly I would roll and stop in traffic right where a cop was.
[00:29:23.227 --> 00:29:25.127]  That's how many there were.
[00:29:25.127 --> 00:29:32.548]  And would try to talk to them, and was treated worse than Mexican cops have treated my family when I've been down there with them.
[00:29:32.548 --> 00:29:35.709]  And I won't go to Mexico because of the Mexican cops.
[00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:37.971]  And I love Mexico.
[00:29:37.971 --> 00:29:38.712]  It's a beautiful country.
[00:29:38.712 --> 00:29:40.013]  A lot of neat stuff.
[00:29:40.013 --> 00:29:42.656]  I will no longer go there because it's too dangerous.
[00:29:42.656 --> 00:29:43.617]  The police are too corrupt.
[00:29:43.617 --> 00:29:44.018]  See?
[00:29:44.018 --> 00:29:44.919]  But see, I can't go.
[00:29:44.919 --> 00:29:46.741]  I can't leave Texas.
[00:29:46.741 --> 00:29:48.062]  I don't want the cops to turn into that.
[00:29:48.062 --> 00:29:49.664]  The big news is coming up.
[00:29:49.664 --> 00:29:51.066]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.066 --> 00:29:53.588]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.588 --> 00:29:56.271]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:06.388]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[00:30:06.388 --> 00:30:15.272]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:23.095]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[00:30:23.095 --> 00:30:30.499]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[00:30:30.999 --> 00:30:34.962]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[00:30:34.962 --> 00:30:39.145]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[00:31:12.523 --> 00:31:21.227]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:31:21.227 --> 00:31:25.310]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.731]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:31:39.392 --> 00:31:41.533]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:43.314]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:43.314 --> 00:31:46.195]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:50.436]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:31:55.538 --> 00:31:57.119]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:57.899]  Got it.
[00:31:57.899 --> 00:31:58.400]  Others don't.
[00:31:59.946 --> 00:32:04.250]  When an emergency happens, you'll be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:10.135]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere, and the threat of bioterrorism is always at hand.
[00:32:10.135 --> 00:32:15.941]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.
[00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:19.464]  Fortunately, there's a simple, effective way to protect yourself.
[00:32:19.864 --> 00:32:27.054]  Supernatural Silver offers a safe and effective means of fighting pathogens and can help defeat the root of these problems.
[00:32:27.054 --> 00:32:36.668]  Supernatural Silver is effective against more than 500 different disease-causing pathogens without encouraging drug resistance and without side effects.

[00:33:07.341 --> 00:33:18.246]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:23.868]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:30.211]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:33:30.211 --> 00:33:31.591]  It is a big idea.
[00:33:37.264 --> 00:33:39.808]  It was almost as if it were a planned enclosure.
[00:33:39.808 --> 00:33:40.950]  It just pancaked.
[00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:48.101]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:34:01.508 --> 00:34:06.870]  I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:34:11.503 --> 00:34:12.383]  Guns will be taken.
[00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:13.924]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:34:13.924 --> 00:34:15.144]  We're going to take all guns.
[00:34:15.144 --> 00:34:19.986]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:34:19.986 --> 00:34:21.546]  Global governance at last.
[00:34:21.546 --> 00:34:23.987]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:34:23.987 --> 00:34:27.788]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:34:27.788 --> 00:34:34.090]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:38.792]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:42.967 --> 00:34:49.429]  I want to give the toll-free number out for radio listeners to join us on any subject you wish to discuss, anything.
[00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:56.132]  Questions, comments, agree, disagree, wide open phones, long-time callers, first-time callers, you name it, 800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:34:56.132 --> 00:34:57.872]  Again, that number, 800-259-9231.
[00:34:57.872 --> 00:34:59.133]  Let me hit some of the news.
[00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:16.483]  Now that I've gone off on that long breakdown of just some of the police state things that are developing.
[00:35:16.483 --> 00:35:21.025]  Here's a story up on DrudgeReport.com in the middle column.
[00:35:21.025 --> 00:35:23.086]  It's also up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:23.086 --> 00:35:31.750]  Homeland Security spends $80 million on armed guards for civil disturbances.
[00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:35.031]  IRS buildings to be protected.
[00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:37.973]  What is the federal government preparing for, Paul Watson asked.
[00:35:37.973 --> 00:35:40.414]  This is from the Federal Business Opportunities website.
[00:35:41.414 --> 00:35:52.170]  The same place we learned about two million dollars for paper targets of children, where they trained to shoot small children, called No More Hesitation.
[00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.336]  Continuing here, IRS buildings to be protected.
[00:35:57.386 --> 00:36:07.620]  The Department of Homeland Security is set to spend $80 million on hiring a raft of armed guards to protect IRS and other government buildings in upstate New York during public demonstrations.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.143]  That's just in New York State, folks.
[00:36:10.143 --> 00:36:11.965]  That's just one of these contracts.
[00:36:11.965 --> 00:36:13.047]  And civil disturbances.
[00:36:13.047 --> 00:36:13.668]  These are quotes.
[00:36:14.955 --> 00:36:22.941]  Once again, prompting concerns that the federal agency is preparing for food stamp riots, anti-tax demonstrations, or some other form of domestic unrest.
[00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:30.427]  Yeah, they're cutting the food stamps massively coming up in just a few months.
[00:36:30.427 --> 00:36:33.549]  In fact, the cuts kick in actually next month.
[00:36:33.549 --> 00:36:34.430]  Time is just flying.
[00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.351]  In the middle of November.
[00:36:36.147 --> 00:36:38.849]  And notice that has nothing to do with the government shutting down any of it.
[00:36:38.849 --> 00:36:46.094]  They are now getting ready to start cutting the social safety net because they've already domesticated you.
[00:36:46.094 --> 00:36:47.455]  They've already fattened you up.
[00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:50.136]  They've already gotten you where you don't know how to work.
[00:36:50.136 --> 00:36:51.657]  They've already shut down the jobs.
[00:36:51.657 --> 00:36:53.158]  They've already shipped them to China.
[00:36:53.158 --> 00:36:54.279]  General Motors has left.
[00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:55.680]  Detroit has collapsed.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.322]  They've already brought in the illegals to drive down the wages.
[00:36:58.322 --> 00:37:05.867]  And everything's being maneuvered now for huge cuts to welfare, food stamps, you name it, because the country is bankrupt.
[00:37:06.467 --> 00:37:15.131]  But, don't worry, it's not going to be allowed to pay off its debts, because we've been signed onto debts that aren't ours, in the derivatives.
[00:37:15.131 --> 00:37:27.457]  The bankers, though, just now want to create the social explosion, so Homeland Security and the armored vehicles, and the checkpoints, and the emergency centers, can all be tested out.
[00:37:27.457 --> 00:37:32.299]  And whether it's this year, next year, or two years down the road, we are entering into a designed collapse.
[00:37:34.048 --> 00:37:38.050]  And the areas like Chicago, New York, D.C.
[00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:43.114]  where they've taken all the guns are going to see unbelievable social unrest under this.
[00:37:43.114 --> 00:37:45.395]  It's already going on.
[00:37:45.395 --> 00:37:48.497]  The crime is already exploding in all the globalist held territories.
[00:37:50.359 --> 00:38:01.368]  And they hope to disarm everybody, but at least they can de-industrialize us, shut our power plants off, shut down our jobs, raise the taxes, pass the health care, to bankrupt the health care industry.
[00:38:01.368 --> 00:38:04.210]  This is all meant to destroy areas they don't control.
[00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.692]  Remember, the globalists are exempt from everything.
[00:38:06.692 --> 00:38:09.915]  The taxes, the regulations, they have diplomatic immunity.
[00:38:10.987 --> 00:38:12.968]  These big hedge fund managers have U.N.
[00:38:12.968 --> 00:38:14.329]  diplomatic immunity.
[00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.809]  The U.N.
[00:38:14.809 --> 00:38:15.910]  people have diplomatic immunity.
[00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.271]  There's hundreds of thousands with diplomatic immunity.
[00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:25.175]  They're now extending a kind of diplomatic immunity light to paramilitaries, to police, to others.
[00:38:25.175 --> 00:38:26.576]  This is their criminal time.
[00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:30.177]  This is their total takeover.
[00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:33.239]  And it's going to be hellish, that's all I can say.
[00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:36.461]  Now, we may be able to get the word out, and they may back off, though.
[00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.411]  At least partially.
[00:38:40.411 --> 00:38:56.523]  The problem is, the globalists have already committed this doomsday machine, is what I'd call it, this perpetual chaos machine, has been so committed now, so rolled out, so implemented, that there's no putting it back in the box.
[00:38:56.523 --> 00:38:59.485]  But they could scale it back, they could curtail it.
[00:38:59.485 --> 00:39:01.227]  And I would advise the globalists to do that.
[00:39:02.819 --> 00:39:03.820]  It isn't hype.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:23.562]  Every one of our sources, from Ron Paul to Stuart Rhodes to myself, to countless others who make contact with the military, active duty and recently retired but also long-term retired, say that just a couple years ago it was 40-50% of the overall military was awake.
[00:39:24.938 --> 00:39:36.306]  Now it's 50% of enlisted, newly enlisted, probably 60-70% of long-time enlisted, and 70-85% of special warfare.
[00:39:36.306 --> 00:39:37.927]  PSYOPs is more like 85%.
[00:39:37.927 --> 00:39:53.298]  Because imagine you're in PSYOPs, and all the old PSYOPs were to discredit tyranny, discredit communism, discredit collectivism, discredit North Korea, discredit Russia, because those were tyrannies and enemies.
[00:39:54.682 --> 00:40:01.089]  Now they get their manuals and it's discredit the family, discredit local government, discredit gun owners, discredit veterans.
[00:40:01.089 --> 00:40:04.313]  And I mean we have these manuals, they've been leaked to us, some are public.
[00:40:04.313 --> 00:40:13.824]  And imagine you're sitting around in PSYOPS going, okay we're now supposed to engage in domestic operations and our target is... the American people?
[00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:23.835]  And they still have the window dressing of, well, we're doing IED training and Kim-Bio training, NBC training, in case Al-Qaeda hits.
[00:40:23.835 --> 00:40:27.217]  That was always the public facade of the military rollout.
[00:40:27.217 --> 00:40:32.040]  And to get the military to go along with it, with the EOD teams, coordinates disposal.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.584]  But there was always, going back even to Reagan in 1987 when this first started, I talked to a
[00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:48.864]  Marine Corps Major who retired early out of the Marines from Space Command and total black government, total shadow government.
[00:40:48.864 --> 00:40:59.109]  And he started a successful computer company and stuff and he was so mad running into an Army checkpoint, this is like 12 years ago, before 9-11, on I-35 and Kyle.
[00:40:59.109 --> 00:41:09.014]  And he'd been a Marine, got out of that, then he'd been a cop for a while, didn't like that, and then went and started a computer company and I visited him in his nice house with his wife and family.
[00:41:10.242 --> 00:41:18.789]  He only showed me the unclassified stuff, but him and Space Command and all the rest of it, and he rode up to this army checkpoint, wanting to search people.
[00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:21.731]  This is in, actually, in the film, Endgame.
[00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:23.793]  Or not Endgame, Road to Tyranny.
[00:41:23.793 --> 00:41:24.453]  It's a short excerpt.
[00:41:24.453 --> 00:41:25.374]  The full interview is online.
[00:41:27.413 --> 00:41:29.915]  And he said, the Army, you're searching people?
[00:41:29.915 --> 00:41:30.816]  Is there a threat?
[00:41:30.816 --> 00:41:32.958]  And they go, no, it's just a drill.
[00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.919]  And he knew what it was.
[00:41:34.919 --> 00:41:42.445]  And he had been on SWAT team raids when he was just a Marine Corps Sergeant.
[00:41:42.445 --> 00:41:54.055]  He had been on SWAT team raids, or maybe it was a, I forget, the point was, he'd been on SWAT team raids of gun dealers' homes with the ATF in Virginia.
[00:41:57.036 --> 00:41:59.438]  And that was in the late 80s.
[00:41:59.438 --> 00:42:05.102]  And because he participated in shadow government operations, they kicked him up to a higher rank, and he went to Space Command.
[00:42:05.102 --> 00:42:08.684]  He wouldn't tell me about that, but he said, oh yeah, it's pretty incredible.
[00:42:08.684 --> 00:42:12.466]  And of course, I already know from Dr. Bob Bowman, former head of Star Wars, what they have.
[00:42:12.466 --> 00:42:19.611]  I mean, they've just got fleets of robot, little like stealth bombers in orbit with all sorts of weapons.
[00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:22.853]  I mean, that's why the globalists are so arrogant, is my point.
[00:42:27.042 --> 00:42:29.004]  I don't know why I just digressed off into that.
[00:42:29.004 --> 00:42:31.186]  My point is, is that it's aimed at us.
[00:42:31.186 --> 00:42:32.727]  It's always been aimed at us.
[00:42:32.727 --> 00:42:36.250]  They've always been training to take us on.
[00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.052]  I've been to Marine Corps drills where they actually let me in.
[00:42:40.089 --> 00:42:45.533]  And then the Colonel Love saw me there, Colonel Love was his name, and freaked out, and they had me thrown out.
[00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:57.762]  But we had other citizen tours they were giving in the California-Oakland takeover, and so that's how we got the footage of them training to take Americans' guns door-to-door and then execute militia leaders.
[00:42:57.762 --> 00:43:05.948]  I mean, what do you think the Marines really do in Fallujah, in Iraq, or what do you think they really did when they were fighting the Taliban going into villages?
[00:43:05.948 --> 00:43:06.709]  They kill everyone.
[00:43:09.272 --> 00:43:12.915]  Just war crime up one side and down the other.
[00:43:12.915 --> 00:43:27.249]  And the colonel, the generals were on the ship, on the Coronado, but the colonel was in charge of the ground landing with troops from eight different nations, training to fight the American people.
[00:43:29.264 --> 00:43:40.833]  And we later learned the drill was for a North Carolina or Georgia type invasion of the South, which we now know they've been drilling for for 20 years, where they think they may get resistance to gun confiscation.
[00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:41.593]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:43:41.593 --> 00:43:42.594]  We got the footage.
[00:43:42.594 --> 00:43:44.675]  We've got the footage of what you're planning.
[00:43:44.675 --> 00:43:47.157]  That was 1999.
[00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:48.458]  Operation Urban Warrior, 1999.
[00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:54.262]  Its symbol was a dragon coming out of the ocean and attacking a U.S.
[00:43:54.262 --> 00:43:56.804]  city.
[00:43:56.804 --> 00:43:58.746]  They even got a patch for the mission.
[00:43:59.591 --> 00:44:01.213]  Skype in Operation Urban Warrior 1999.
[00:44:01.213 --> 00:44:02.174]  It's a big green dragon.
[00:44:02.174 --> 00:44:03.616]  You guys can find it.
[00:44:03.616 --> 00:44:05.478]  And imagine, I'm just a regular guy.
[00:44:05.478 --> 00:44:07.300]  I want to warn people.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.643]  So I get on the air and I start saying, OK, here's the footage.
[00:44:10.643 --> 00:44:12.185]  OK, this is going on.
[00:44:12.185 --> 00:44:20.675]  And then the Marines reportedly, along with other government people, call the home corporate office of Shamrock Communications.
[00:44:22.486 --> 00:44:34.008]  It was the thing in like Scranton, Ohio, and they fly out and they go, you're not to talk bad about the Marines anymore, you're not to talk bad about the government anymore, or Waco anymore, or Bill Clinton anymore, or you're fired.
[00:44:34.008 --> 00:44:37.349]  And I said, well I can't, so a while later they fired me.
[00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:42.170]  They gave me like nine weeks to quit and kept saying, we're gonna fire you, we're gonna fire you, we're gonna fire you.
[00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:47.291]  I mean, I've had the Marines have me kicked off the radio in America.
[00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:54.656]  Okay, I mean, they've been PSYOPing and operating domestically since Smedley Butler's time, and he blew the whistle on that.
[00:44:54.656 --> 00:44:58.478]  A plan to use the Marines for a military coup and to bring in fascism.
[00:44:58.478 --> 00:45:02.741]  And that got stopped in the 30s, and we're going to stop it again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:02.741 --> 00:45:04.482]  So the average Marine is a great person.
[00:45:04.482 --> 00:45:08.404]  The average Army soldier is a great person.
[00:45:08.404 --> 00:45:14.528]  I know they try to teach them in briefings that I'm anti-Marine or I'm anti-Army, and that actually has backfired on them.
[00:45:14.528 --> 00:45:17.570]  In fact, I finally reverse-engineered that I'm going to your phone calls.
[00:45:19.881 --> 00:45:22.863]  Why our show originally got so popular?
[00:45:22.863 --> 00:45:24.123]  One of the biggest things was this.
[00:45:24.123 --> 00:45:27.465]  A, it was accurate.
[00:45:27.465 --> 00:45:28.745]  B, it was original.
[00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:39.111]  But C, and most importantly, we had Patriot supporters out there that knew we were being hardcore about the truth and were telling the truth.
[00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:45.134]  A, B, C, D. But D is very important as well.
[00:45:45.134 --> 00:45:46.774]  They did, by the late 90s,
[00:45:48.516 --> 00:46:12.533]  Briefings in the Army and the Marines and the Air Force, and then later even other sub-services, where they would find one of my films or a recording on cassette or CD or whatever, and they would call everyone in and say, this man is an enemy, this man is a liar, this man is dangerous, he tells a kernel of the truth, don't listen to him, he's anti-American.
[00:46:12.533 --> 00:46:14.495]  What do you think everybody did when they heard that?
[00:46:16.294 --> 00:46:17.675]  They all went and tuned in.
[00:46:17.675 --> 00:46:20.978]  Because we used to see the traffic coming in and going.
[00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:24.801]  Half the visits to our website are the military and the government.
[00:46:24.801 --> 00:46:27.503]  And it wasn't the government even spying on us.
[00:46:27.503 --> 00:46:30.005]  I'm sure a small percentage of it was that.
[00:46:30.005 --> 00:46:35.489]  It was the military listening because they were being told, don't listen to this.
[00:46:35.489 --> 00:46:41.674]  And now I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, we are the number one show in the military.
[00:46:42.895 --> 00:46:45.917]  The number one show that they're listening to.
[00:46:45.917 --> 00:46:48.119]  And they know I don't have all the answers and I don't know everything.
[00:46:48.119 --> 00:46:49.320]  I'm just a regular guy.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.280]  Like they are.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.303]  But they can go see everything I'm telling them is in their manuals.
[00:46:53.303 --> 00:46:55.484]  They know everything I'm talking about is accurate.
[00:46:55.484 --> 00:46:57.486]  They can have a different take on it, a different perspective.
[00:46:57.486 --> 00:46:59.587]  But I'm just telling the truth here, folks.
[00:46:59.587 --> 00:47:07.453]  I just witnessed Marines training to take our guns and saying it was for America and it's my patriotic duty to go out and warn people.
[00:47:07.453 --> 00:47:08.434]  The rest is up to you.
[00:47:08.434 --> 00:47:09.515]  It isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:47:11.907 --> 00:47:13.009]  But let me go over this news.
[00:47:13.009 --> 00:47:20.237]  Homeland Security spends $80 million on armed guards for civil disturbances just in New York alone.
[00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:32.311]  According to a solicitation posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, the Federal Protective Services, the unit of the DHS, is looking
[00:47:33.878 --> 00:47:42.983]  For a contractor to supply armed protective security guards to guard a variety of government buildings in the region, including IRS buildings, during tax season.
[00:47:42.983 --> 00:47:52.129]  Yeah, when you get that $5,000 fee, $3,000 to $5,000 fee, well, I guess if it's a household that's more than $5,000, they think you're gonna get mad.
[00:47:52.129 --> 00:47:59.433]  Now, I've told you, whenever they have any type of demonstrations going on, they park armored vehicles in front of the entrances of the IRS here in Austin.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.363]  I mean, because they are an occupying army that works for offshore banks.
[00:48:03.363 --> 00:48:07.367]  I mean, the offshore bankers know they're involved in a criminal takeover of America.
[00:48:07.367 --> 00:48:09.870]  Do you think they're arming to the teeth against us?
[00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:10.531]  Of course they are!
[00:48:12.102 --> 00:48:27.052]  And now I know for a fact that the senior people at the IRS here in Austin, the biggest IRS center in the country, it's like for five states, I know for a fact they're listening and know it's true and now know that all the big rich guys are exempt and they really feel bad.
[00:48:27.052 --> 00:48:31.455]  The IRS used to think taking all ladies' houses on average was really to run the country and stuff.
[00:48:31.455 --> 00:48:33.797]  Now they know it's all a way to destroy America.
[00:48:33.797 --> 00:48:35.458]  The power to tax, the power to destroy.
[00:48:35.458 --> 00:48:37.219]  They have the lowest morale ever.
[00:48:37.219 --> 00:48:42.022]  They're trying to get rid of people entirely, go right to computers and digital stuff to just grab the money out of you.
[00:48:42.022 --> 00:48:42.942]  We're good to go.
[00:49:06.914 --> 00:49:09.595]  What, you think they ship everything to India because they like Indians?
[00:49:09.595 --> 00:49:12.816]  That's the cheapest humans they can find is in India.
[00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:15.797]  As many people in India now as there is in China.
[00:49:15.797 --> 00:49:16.957]  Even poorer.
[00:49:16.957 --> 00:49:18.178]  And smart.
[00:49:18.178 --> 00:49:19.858]  You think you can compete with them?
[00:49:19.858 --> 00:49:26.940]  Just as smart as you, or smarter, living in the street by day, or by night, and working in the building by day.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:34.943]  A lot of Indians are happy just to go in and work all day at a computer center because they go and, you know, eight, nine people live in a one-room deal.
[00:49:35.868 --> 00:49:37.189]  With no windows.
[00:49:37.189 --> 00:49:39.089]  And might be lucky if they get one meal a day.
[00:49:39.089 --> 00:49:40.830]  So they like to sleep at their desk.
[00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.110]  Think you can compete with that?
[00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:42.951]  Well guess what?
[00:49:42.951 --> 00:49:45.372]  Soon you won't even be competing with them.
[00:49:45.372 --> 00:49:49.493]  Soon you'll be competing with computers that just take it out of your bank account.
[00:49:49.493 --> 00:49:51.554]  And that's what the whole NSA Obamacare.
[00:49:51.554 --> 00:49:56.276]  The Obamacare computers interface with the Know Your Customer are going to take everything out of your bank account.
[00:49:58.567 --> 00:50:07.532]  And even when you pay with cash, you're going to have to show your driver's license and it's going to be put in a database on you to see if you, quote, have been doing any underground economy, trying to survive.
[00:50:07.532 --> 00:50:09.714]  And then they're going to come and they're going to arrest you.
[00:50:09.714 --> 00:50:13.616]  They're going to send a paramilitary team stacked up ten deep at your house.
[00:50:13.616 --> 00:50:15.717]  And if you resist, they're going to kill you.
[00:50:15.717 --> 00:50:18.739]  So this is the designed destruction of America.
[00:50:18.739 --> 00:50:24.843]  Now, the military and the police can wake up, say no, speak out, or you can sign your own death warrant.
[00:50:25.967 --> 00:50:29.268]  Politically, and economically, and spiritually, and go along with this.
[00:50:29.268 --> 00:50:34.071]  I mean, why would anyone want to sign on to offshore banks that want to desolate us economically?
[00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:37.892]  We're going to go to your phone calls when we come back, and then coming up, Mark Faber.
[00:50:37.892 --> 00:50:40.173]  Fed could QE up to one trillion a month.
[00:50:40.173 --> 00:50:41.554]  Of course they will.
[00:50:41.554 --> 00:50:44.035]  And then sign the debt on to you.
[00:50:44.035 --> 00:50:46.056]  They get the money, you pay the debt.
[00:50:46.056 --> 00:50:47.176]  Of course they will.
[00:50:47.176 --> 00:50:51.378]  The armored troops are standing by if you don't like it.
[00:50:51.378 --> 00:50:55.140]  Marketplace, where people buy compulsory insurance with other people's money.
[00:50:55.816 --> 00:50:58.618]  We're going to break it all down coming up after your phone call.
[00:50:58.618 --> 00:51:01.779]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.779 --> 00:51:03.400]  Time and time again.

[00:51:06.322 --> 00:51:07.743]  We need assistance.
[00:51:07.743 --> 00:51:08.583]  Please!
[00:51:08.583 --> 00:51:12.165]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:51:12.165 --> 00:51:18.549]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:21.090]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.672]  Take action now so that you're prepared for the next disaster.

[00:54:11.977 --> 00:54:16.827]  Is it getting better?
[00:54:16.827 --> 00:54:18.590]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:20.900]  By the way, I knew this would happen.
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:26.023]  There's an article up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:54:26.023 --> 00:54:27.824]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[00:54:27.824 --> 00:54:31.466]  We haven't gotten into the big diversion, but it is pretty sad.
[00:54:31.466 --> 00:54:37.170]  The Obamacare woman collapsing and Obama saving her, and now she'll get her health care.
[00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.372]  I mean, just completely zombie-like, his supporters.
[00:54:42.333 --> 00:54:45.455]  In fact, can we play that video here in a moment after we take calls?
[00:54:45.455 --> 00:54:54.022]  Because it just, it just encaptures, encaptures, encapsulates and captures the zombiosis of these people.
[00:54:54.022 --> 00:54:59.446]  But now Democrats are warming to the delay, as I knew they would.
[00:54:59.446 --> 00:55:00.627]  They're warming to it.
[00:55:00.627 --> 00:55:04.369]  They're warming, like when the pimp breaks, you know, one of his
[00:55:05.711 --> 00:55:07.713]  Prostitutes knows.
[00:55:07.713 --> 00:55:09.395]  She begs and warms to it.
[00:55:09.395 --> 00:55:12.838]  Then he just takes that coat hanger and beats her in the face with it.
[00:55:12.838 --> 00:55:14.580]  Beats her on the head with it.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:18.524]  And then Roundhouse kicks her and then she just crawls around the ground bleeding, begging.
[00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:21.067]  Baby, I'm sorry, baby.
[00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:23.489]  He just stomps on her again and she begs.
[00:55:23.489 --> 00:55:24.871]  Oh, please.
[00:55:24.871 --> 00:55:27.093]  I mean, that's the Democrats.
[00:55:27.093 --> 00:55:27.834]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:27.834 --> 00:55:29.015]  This is so pathetic.
[00:55:30.526 --> 00:55:34.409]  You look at the Democrats on that stage, they're all shuffling around, look like zombies.
[00:55:34.409 --> 00:55:36.191]  And then they're just like collapsing and stuff.
[00:55:36.191 --> 00:55:39.013]  That woman looks like, looks like, look at her!
[00:55:39.013 --> 00:55:39.874]  She looks like a zombie!
[00:55:39.874 --> 00:55:44.959]  I shouldn't laugh, it's so sick!
[00:55:44.959 --> 00:55:46.620]  What has this country turned to?
[00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.342]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[00:55:48.342 --> 00:55:49.483]  Then I'll go to the calls.
[00:55:49.483 --> 00:55:51.745]  Oh my goodness, this is just getting too ridiculous.
[00:55:51.745 --> 00:55:56.609]  The free families from the pervasive fear that one illness
[00:56:01.846 --> 00:56:03.587]  I'm right here.
[00:56:03.587 --> 00:56:07.869]  Look at her, she's like... This happens when I talk too long.
[00:56:07.869 --> 00:56:13.271]  Oh my gosh, I mean just look at the limbing like look of all those other people.
[00:56:13.271 --> 00:56:16.052]  Come with us here to the euthanasia center.
[00:56:16.052 --> 00:56:17.853]  It's alright.
[00:56:17.853 --> 00:56:20.034]  She got a little too much bromine and fluoride.
[00:56:20.034 --> 00:56:23.776]  You know Obama didn't get any of that.
[00:56:27.073 --> 00:56:29.173]  He loves you so much.
[00:56:29.173 --> 00:56:33.614]  Oh man, he wants to help you, let me tell you.
[00:56:33.614 --> 00:56:43.616]  I'm always talking to folks, you know they did tens of thousands of major secret testing and in some cases thousands of people got sick or died per program.
[00:56:43.616 --> 00:56:45.156]  And folks go, yeah, but they don't do that now.
[00:56:45.156 --> 00:56:48.777]  And I'm like, oh no, the government's just 10 times more evil now.
[00:56:48.777 --> 00:56:50.277]  There's nothing going on.
[00:56:50.277 --> 00:56:55.078]  Is that why the public cancer rates are up 3,000% and the average person can't talk now?
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:01.941]  And they're all up on the stage going, I mean, not even knowing what planet they're on.
[00:57:01.941 --> 00:57:07.903]  And I laugh because it's gallows, gallows humor, folks.
[00:57:07.903 --> 00:57:11.224]  I am completely freaked out.
[00:57:11.224 --> 00:57:12.404]  And I never got to this yesterday.
[00:57:12.404 --> 00:57:13.964]  They go, hey, did you see the woman collapse?
[00:57:13.964 --> 00:57:15.765]  And I was like, no, no, cue it up.
[00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:17.705]  And I never watched it till after the show.
[00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:21.266]  But I said on the show, I said, I bet she looks like some zombie.
[00:57:21.266 --> 00:57:23.707]  And then they had the zombie on Piers Morgan last night.
[00:57:24.804 --> 00:57:29.408]  Because I was in a restaurant after we went out shooting with McAvee and I saw it on the screen.
[00:57:29.408 --> 00:57:31.950]  And like, here's this guy with like 350,000 viewers now.
[00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.831]  It was 2 million when he took it over.
[00:57:33.831 --> 00:57:36.313]  Larry King had like 10 million a decade ago.
[00:57:36.313 --> 00:57:39.276]  But everyone, it's still like, oh, that's the big media.
[00:57:39.276 --> 00:57:46.822]  Piers Morgan, a butt-naked emperor, the emperor's new clothes, a total hoax, but then he gets every big guest.
[00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:50.152]  Michael Hastings' wife goes on there.
[00:57:50.152 --> 00:57:50.893]  Everybody does.
[00:57:50.893 --> 00:57:53.055]  But it doesn't matter what they do.
[00:57:53.055 --> 00:57:57.119]  Then the zombie goes on, so I had to turn the TV up.
[00:57:57.119 --> 00:58:01.143]  And she was just thanking Obama, saying, just like he reached out and saved me.
[00:58:02.583 --> 00:58:02.863]  I don't
[00:58:24.229 --> 00:58:25.109]  They're like children.
[00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:26.190]  They're like five-year-olds.
[00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:28.951]  Like I said, getting in the car with the man that goes, Candy!
[00:58:28.951 --> 00:58:32.713]  And the five-year-old says, Mommy says no, and they go, Puppy!
[00:58:32.713 --> 00:58:33.833]  Puppy!
[00:58:33.833 --> 00:58:34.674]  Puppy!
[00:58:34.674 --> 00:58:36.935]  Your phone calls are coming up back in one minute.
[00:58:36.935 --> 00:58:42.997]  Obama has a puppy!
[00:58:42.997 --> 00:58:46.959]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[00:59:55.835 --> 01:00:05.142]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.142 --> 01:00:06.443]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.443 --> 01:00:08.224]  Mainstream media.

[01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.488]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:17.311]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.311 --> 01:00:21.374]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:29.929]  Well, some rescuers were trying to save some people in Pakistan, but they got double-tapped by a drone.
[01:00:29.929 --> 01:00:31.170]  Good job, robots.
[01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.071]  Robots, score 10 million.
[01:00:33.071 --> 01:00:34.311]  Humans, score zero.
[01:00:34.311 --> 01:00:41.215]  And the soft kill, GMO and fluoride water and everything is doing its job.
[01:00:41.215 --> 01:00:42.436]  New World Order, 10 million.
[01:00:42.436 --> 01:00:43.516]  Humanity, zero.
[01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:44.237]  Hoorah!
[01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:54.374]  Alright, and Obamacare is absolutely destroying the healthcare in this country, making it ten times worse, another devastating victory.
[01:00:54.374 --> 01:00:59.456]  War on Drugs is shipping more drugs in than ever, laundering the money, keeping the price high for the big banks.
[01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:01.457]  Big, big success!
[01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:04.438]  Hoorah, New World Order!
[01:01:04.438 --> 01:01:07.019]  Alright, our ancestors are being defeated.
[01:01:07.019 --> 01:01:09.579]  All those that fought for human dignity are being defeated.
[01:01:09.579 --> 01:01:12.560]  Evil is putting more points on the board.
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.461]  I support Homeland Security, so I support it.
[01:01:16.203 --> 01:01:19.164]  I need to get a Hail Homeland Security, Hail Satan intro here.
[01:01:19.164 --> 01:01:21.025]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:24.326]  I really want to hear from you, Tim, Peter, Michael, David, Mike, and many others.
[01:01:24.326 --> 01:01:26.967]  We've got a bunch of news coming up, but let's start going to your calls right now.
[01:01:26.967 --> 01:01:28.667]  Tim, welcome to the airwaves, sir.
[01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:31.188]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.649]  Well, I'm pretty evil right now.
[01:01:32.649 --> 01:01:34.129]  I just, I like George Washington.
[01:01:34.129 --> 01:01:35.690]  That pretty much covers everything, doesn't it?
[01:01:36.252 --> 01:01:39.593]  I must be an evil person, too, then, because I think about those guys a lot.
[01:01:39.593 --> 01:01:40.953]  Oh, man, what a terrorist.
[01:01:40.953 --> 01:01:47.974]  You know, do you ever think that maybe Obama rolls in his bed from nightmares of, like, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington haunting him?
[01:01:47.974 --> 01:01:56.136]  No, I think he's haunted by the sulfur smell he puts off making women pass out and all the flies that I've seen coming out of his mouth on video.
[01:01:56.136 --> 01:02:00.117]  I mean, I think, like, the Amityville horror actually, like, lives in him.
[01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:06.869]  I think at night, like, he turns into a pig with red eyes and floats around the room.
[01:02:06.869 --> 01:02:08.990]  Probably does, man.
[01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:12.332]  I called in today to... I mean, you know he probably bathes in, like, pig blood.
[01:02:12.332 --> 01:02:13.573]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:13.573 --> 01:02:15.795]  Who knows what he bathes in?
[01:02:15.795 --> 01:02:18.056]  He bathes in, like, fly guts.
[01:02:18.056 --> 01:02:31.105]  I called in today to talk to you guys about... I always hear Alex talk about the gangsterism attitude of America, how the MTV and the BET hip-hop gangster culture took over our country.
[01:02:32.774 --> 01:02:46.999]  I've heard a lot of people call into your show, Alex, but I've never heard, I mean I heard Freeway Ricky Ross, which has, not similar because he's like way big time, but he experienced some of the same things that I experienced, and I'm a white male.
[01:02:46.999 --> 01:02:48.019]  I'm a white American male.
[01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:52.665]  By the way, that's not Rick Ross, the big fat hippopotamus guy.
[01:02:52.665 --> 01:02:54.566]  That's the real Freeway Ricky Ross.
[01:02:54.566 --> 01:02:57.388]  Hey, Ricky Ross, the guy that was dealing drugs for the CIA.
[01:02:57.388 --> 01:02:58.728]  Yes.
[01:02:58.728 --> 01:03:04.692]  I heard him on your show, but I've never heard any real, like, gangster types from our public.
[01:03:04.692 --> 01:03:10.955]  I've heard famous guys like rappers and stuff on your show, but I've never heard actual citizens call in and say, yeah, you're telling the truth.
[01:03:12.343 --> 01:03:15.644]  I grew up in a bad neighborhood in southern Florida.
[01:03:15.644 --> 01:03:20.625]  I grew up in an all-black neighborhood and my mother worked three jobs and she had cancer for about ten years.
[01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:21.785]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:03:21.785 --> 01:03:24.865]  And she was alone and my dad was on the other side of the country.
[01:03:24.865 --> 01:03:26.946]  They split up and I had no father.
[01:03:26.946 --> 01:03:38.068]  So I adopted the MTV gangster culture and the hip-hop culture and that's what was going on in my neighborhood and I grew up during like 94, which the gang intensity was really hot.
[01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:43.074]  So I got involved with the Rollin' 60s, the Blood Gang.
[01:03:43.074 --> 01:03:46.016]  So you were slingin' rock, huh?
[01:03:46.016 --> 01:03:50.459]  I wasn't slingin' rock, but I was carrying, I was packin' heat at 14 years old.
[01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.120]  I had a .380 in my waist all the time.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.801]  I had a 12-gauge shotgun under my bed.
[01:03:53.801 --> 01:03:57.504]  I was runnin' scared from the police, runnin' scared from everybody.
[01:03:57.504 --> 01:04:01.806]  And I was just a young, stupid kid that didn't have no direction from a father.
[01:04:01.806 --> 01:04:05.529]  My mother was working all the time, and what it really was, I had no love.
[01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:07.210]  So I went and I looked for love in other places.
[01:04:08.957 --> 01:04:13.881]  I'll tell everybody right now listening to this show, Alex Jones is absolutely correct.
[01:04:13.881 --> 01:04:24.369]  I come from a generation that grew up on this hip-hop gangster culture, and the music, the movies, the films, all of it, it hypnotizes you.
[01:04:24.369 --> 01:04:27.492]  It brainwashes you into thinking that that's what you need to do.
[01:04:27.972 --> 01:04:39.605]  You've got young males that are looking for a male role model, and young women are looking for it, and they tell you it's some giant fat person with gold hanging around their neck, calling women hoes, and it's on record.
[01:04:39.605 --> 01:04:41.367]  I've talked to people at MTV that were high level.
[01:04:41.367 --> 01:04:46.993]  They said, even better than rock and roll satanism to destroy young people, we're going to go with this gangster culture.
[01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:50.255]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:04:50.255 --> 01:04:54.996]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:04:54.996 --> 01:04:58.436]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.282]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.623]  They're the good guys.

[01:08:13.273 --> 01:08:17.477]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.477 --> 01:08:21.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:37.192]  EBT looters are to be shamed online.
[01:08:37.192 --> 01:08:45.218]  The police will publicly release the identities of people who were given unlimited EBT, who said money didn't grow on trees of its taxpayers.
[01:08:45.218 --> 01:08:53.084]  The police are going to post it online, but in the whole welfare culture, gaming the EBT, I mean, that is...
[01:08:54.065 --> 01:08:58.446]  That is pimp game, as MTV and some of the Redstone teaches us.
[01:08:58.446 --> 01:09:03.087]  So I think that'll actually make everybody heroes when the cops do that.
[01:09:03.087 --> 01:09:04.887]  John McAvee, the video's up there.
[01:09:04.887 --> 01:09:08.628]  It's a newsmaker, because he's not on any other TV interviews in a long time.
[01:09:08.628 --> 01:09:10.429]  He does text interviews.
[01:09:10.429 --> 01:09:13.449]  He says Obamacare is unfixable as a top programmer.
[01:09:13.449 --> 01:09:15.690]  He says scrap it.
[01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:20.871]  And by the way, coming up on the Nightly News, we're going to have more interviews out shooting with John McAvee.
[01:09:22.642 --> 01:09:30.446]  And then tomorrow night, we're going to air John McAvee on the Nightly News firing twin 50s handheld.
[01:09:30.446 --> 01:09:32.407]  So that is coming up.
[01:09:32.407 --> 01:09:38.331]  And yes, I was firing the 50s handheld and didn't think it had much of a kick until I woke up this morning.
[01:09:38.331 --> 01:09:43.954]  I really have blown some muscles out my back.
[01:09:43.954 --> 01:09:45.975]  So that's coming up.
[01:09:45.975 --> 01:09:47.836]  And we're going to have a special in-studio guest.
[01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:56.429]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, surprise guests who are supporters of Obamacare and of vaccines.
[01:09:56.429 --> 01:10:00.670]  Will you guys print me the CDC adverse reaction pamphlet?
[01:10:00.670 --> 01:10:02.151]  Just the synopsis.
[01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:03.911]  That's like 40 pages.
[01:10:03.911 --> 01:10:07.913]  Not the actual reactions, because that's several thousand pages.
[01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:10.534]  If you index the top 20 vaccines or so.
[01:10:10.534 --> 01:10:17.116]  I don't want the multi-thousand pages of death, cancer, Guillain-Barré, narcolepsy, permanent epilepsy,
[01:10:20.993 --> 01:10:26.557]  All sorts of other disorders, autoimmune disorders, miscarriages.
[01:10:26.557 --> 01:10:29.819]  We're just going to go over some of the stuff, because they say they're safe and effective.
[01:10:29.819 --> 01:10:31.300]  There are no side effects.
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.321]  Anyone that says it is a liar.
[01:10:33.321 --> 01:10:36.483]  So I thought we would actually have some of these idiots in here.
[01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:40.926]  And they're idiots, and I'm calling them idiots out there in the control room.
[01:10:40.926 --> 01:10:42.567]  Get them all riled up, the scum.
[01:10:42.567 --> 01:10:46.830]  We're going to have them in here to tell us how great all this is at the bottom of the hour.
[01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:47.431]  But right now,
[01:10:48.695 --> 01:10:49.718]  Some of the other headlines.
[01:10:49.718 --> 01:10:50.921]  This is big.
[01:10:50.921 --> 01:10:56.013]  Homeland Security spends $80 million on armed guards for civil disturbances.
[01:10:58.214 --> 01:10:59.295]  And where's that from?
[01:10:59.295 --> 01:11:02.057]  That's from the Federal Business Website.
[01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:04.539]  Federal Business Opportunities Website.
[01:11:04.539 --> 01:11:12.345]  Remember last year you learned at Infowars.com, just because we're actual journalists and dig through the news articles.
[01:11:12.345 --> 01:11:15.968]  Nothing special about me or my crew.
[01:11:15.968 --> 01:11:16.809]  They actually are special.
[01:11:16.809 --> 01:11:18.230]  They're hardworking and smart.
[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:20.012]  We go through there and find out about how they're
[01:11:20.532 --> 01:11:36.631]  The Pentagon's buying up civilian guns so we can't get them under Obama's orders, or how they bought two and a half billion rounds of ammo now, or how they're buying thousands of armored vehicles a month to get them to police to battle the American people, or how they're buying two million dollars of paper targets of children for no hesitation to train to kill children.
[01:11:38.288 --> 01:11:42.612]  Or how the new army manual says the founding fathers are the enemy, you know, and wouldn't be accepted in the U.S.
[01:11:42.612 --> 01:11:43.193]  military.
[01:11:43.193 --> 01:11:48.298]  And Forbes and AP report the Pentagon's main mission is to battle American libertarians.
[01:11:48.298 --> 01:11:50.240]  Because we're the only Americans left, of course!
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.864]  A foreign takeover says we, the good guys, are the bad guys.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:13.229]  This is the Sovietization, like we're Poland taken over by Russia, but it isn't Poland, it's a global corporatist group that's almost impossible to actually pin down or stop, because it's a bunch of interlocking multinational corporations, bigger GDPs together than four or five top nations combined.
[01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:19.932]  Of the fortune of the top 100 GDPs in the world, more than 50 are corporations now.
[01:12:19.932 --> 01:12:21.373]  Just to give you an idea, you can look that up.
[01:12:22.773 --> 01:12:32.721]  I think it was like 12 years ago we crossed the Rubicon where more than 50% of the top 100 economies are corporations, not countries.
[01:12:32.721 --> 01:12:51.036]  And they're above the law, and they write the laws, and they write the rules, and they don't want you to be in business, and they don't want you to use cash, and they don't want you to go to the farmer's market, and they don't want you to go to a local business, and they don't, and so it's our job, as much as we can, to not traffic with big establishment corporations and businesses.
[01:12:51.036 --> 01:12:51.956]  Whenever I went to
[01:12:53.715 --> 01:12:58.097]  England to cover Bilderberg and I'm going to your calls this year a few months ago.
[01:12:58.097 --> 01:13:07.241]  I had an MI5 group of people show up and were waiting for me downstairs and they only made themselves known when I was alone.
[01:13:07.241 --> 01:13:12.043]  They just came up and gave me some intel that turned out to be accurate.
[01:13:12.043 --> 01:13:18.606]  And then the local police head liaison for the county and all the other departments met with me and had dinner.
[01:13:19.682 --> 01:13:40.638]  He's very professional and in fact he didn't eat he had a he had a coca-cola and he said I'm really surprised you're staying at a corporate hotel I wouldn't be doing that I'd be staying at a mom-and-pop you're a hypocrite I said listen we don't always do everything perfectly this is all we could get for enough rooms for all of my crew we tried local mom-and-pops he goes okay I see your point but he was actually right
[01:13:42.108 --> 01:13:46.231]  And what was funny is when I ran to the MI5 people, they said the same thing.
[01:13:46.231 --> 01:13:52.976]  And they weren't just putting me on, they were genuinely pissed off at the system.
[01:13:52.976 --> 01:14:06.325]  And I was telling police, well you know your cancer rates have more than tripled and here's a London Independent article that was laying there in the hotel, you know, free every day, saying that by 2020, half of Brits will have cancer.
[01:14:06.325 --> 01:14:07.686]  And they said, we know!
[01:14:07.686 --> 01:14:09.908]  We know about the health service, I don't need to be told about it.
[01:14:09.908 --> 01:14:10.829]  My mother just died!
[01:14:12.779 --> 01:14:24.384]  And then we had one listener who was out there, remember, who was walking by the Grove Grounds, where the golf course and the hotel are, past a private citizen's home in the semi-rural area.
[01:14:24.384 --> 01:14:28.025]  It's like suburban to rural.
[01:14:28.025 --> 01:14:32.807]  And that's my favorite type of place, like where it's rural, but also it's like still got some city in it.
[01:14:33.809 --> 01:14:35.331]  And the guy goes, no, you can come here.
[01:14:35.331 --> 01:14:36.052]  You're my guest.
[01:14:36.052 --> 01:14:37.374]  Police don't harass him.
[01:14:37.374 --> 01:14:38.515]  And the guy's like, get away from me.
[01:14:38.515 --> 01:14:41.579]  My wife just died in your National Health Service, waiting for care.
[01:14:41.579 --> 01:14:43.982]  I mean, they're mad folks.
[01:14:43.982 --> 01:14:46.165]  They get the governments out to screw them.
[01:14:46.165 --> 01:14:51.652]  And we have to get that same attitude and understand it is a corporate globalist government.
[01:14:54.309 --> 01:14:59.432]  That is absolutely out to get us, and we've got to shop with local businesses.
[01:14:59.432 --> 01:15:01.693]  We've got to support local restaurants.
[01:15:01.693 --> 01:15:03.694]  We've got to support local factories.
[01:15:03.694 --> 01:15:06.556]  We've got to support the local lumberyard.
[01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:22.344]  Even if their service isn't as good, and even if it costs a little more, because they don't have everything rigged, and even if their, you know, alcoholic son is out back giving you the wood and is rude to you, if you don't support those local people, it's over, folks, because the globalists want to shut this economy down.
[01:15:22.344 --> 01:15:23.045]  I'm done ranting.
[01:15:25.259 --> 01:15:26.320]  Interpol Chief!
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.901]  Armed citizens globally to prevent terror attacks.
[01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:30.523]  Wow!
[01:15:30.523 --> 01:15:31.823]  Interpol Chief!
[01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:48.394]  Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble told ABC News that one of the ways to prevent terrorists from hitting soft targets was to arm citizens globally, noting that the Westgate mall siege would have been averted far quicker if it had taken place in gun-friendly states like Denver or Texas.
[01:15:48.394 --> 01:15:50.676]  I wonder how long this guy's going to be there!
[01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:54.580]  Not very quick!
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.760]  Common sense?
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.561]  Man, I bet he's canned in three months.
[01:15:59.561 --> 01:16:00.781]  They're going to start looking for reasons.
[01:16:00.781 --> 01:16:01.501]  It's like Ted Cruz.
[01:16:01.501 --> 01:16:03.282]  I see these comments and emails.
[01:16:03.282 --> 01:16:05.782]  Why aren't you covering Ted Cruz and his corruption?
[01:16:05.782 --> 01:16:07.803]  And Stephen the Bahamas?
[01:16:07.803 --> 01:16:08.523]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:13.684]  Decades ago, his college buddy started a business and asked all his friends to invest.
[01:16:13.684 --> 01:16:15.445]  That's what you do to help each other.
[01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:19.645]  He invested $6,000 and had forgotten about it on his financial holdings.
[01:16:19.645 --> 01:16:21.346]  You think some lawyer that makes
[01:16:21.906 --> 01:16:23.967]  Half a million dollars a year as a top lawyer?
[01:16:23.967 --> 01:16:26.649]  Remember some investment he made with a college buddy for $6,000?
[01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:33.013]  This is the dirtiness of him being on some board with his college buddy?
[01:16:33.013 --> 01:16:40.638]  Compared to like Dianne Feinstein who went to Congress with less than a million dollars and is now worth a hundred million?
[01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:44.720]  And who gives deals and biotech to her husband worth billions?
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.721]  Who's worth billions?
[01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:46.201]  I mean, no.
[01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:47.182]  Oh, forget all that!
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:52.121]  Forget, I mean, it's like if you talk about liberty, they say you're a racist with no proof.
[01:16:52.121 --> 01:16:53.982]  Southern Poverty Law Center, MSNBC.
[01:16:53.982 --> 01:17:04.726]  But if you actually say, I admire Hitler, I want to be a dictator, black people aren't humans, I always admired Hitler, then you get ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center awards.
[01:17:04.726 --> 01:17:13.789]  See, you have to dress in a Nazi uniform, your father has to be an SS officer, you have to be best friends with a former top SS officer, Kirk Voltheim, who killed US soldiers.
[01:17:14.509 --> 01:17:16.771]  Uh, who were caught behind enemy lines in Serbia.
[01:17:16.771 --> 01:17:27.160]  If you're an actual purebred SS product marriage, his brother was older than him, actually born in World War II, Arnold was born after World War II, the product of an SS breeding campaign.
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.464]  If you're the product of an SS breeding campaign, then you get an ADL award.
[01:17:31.464 --> 01:17:32.024]  I'm serious.
[01:17:32.024 --> 01:17:33.706]  He's got the highest awards.
[01:17:33.706 --> 01:17:35.988]  If you stand against Nazism, you're attacked.
[01:17:36.957 --> 01:17:39.799]  Now, that's upside down, isn't it?
[01:17:39.799 --> 01:17:41.881]  That's how it works.
[01:17:41.881 --> 01:17:46.605]  So they'll be digging around in the Interpol chief's dossier to find something now.
[01:17:46.605 --> 01:17:48.847]  Maybe he has a crooked toenail or something.
[01:17:48.847 --> 01:17:52.910]  Let's go ahead and talk to, well, common sense rears its head.
[01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:55.092]  Peter in Washington, you're on the air, Extremist.
[01:17:55.092 --> 01:17:57.173]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.094]  Hello, Alex.
[01:17:58.094 --> 01:17:59.015]  You can hear me?
[01:17:59.015 --> 01:17:59.796]  Yes, sir, I can.
[01:18:00.666 --> 01:18:10.891]  Okay, I just want to talk about one of the issues that you had brought up on the Middle East.
[01:18:10.891 --> 01:18:27.879]  And, you know, going back to the history of the intelligence services operating with the fanatics, I think the basis of it was the wipeout of a British command post at Khartoum by a
[01:18:30.337 --> 01:18:34.880]  Uh, charismatic figure called Democracy and his followers.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:47.887]  But what I wanted to bring out is that, uh, it wasn't all cynicism, that I think there was some conversion going on.
[01:18:47.887 --> 01:18:56.352]  Years ago, I read a novel by Kipling called The Light That Failed about a artist that lost his sight.
[01:18:56.352 --> 01:18:59.314]  Well, I saw the movie and then I, I read the book.
[01:19:00.385 --> 01:19:07.512]  And the book, this was kind of, you know, suggested that this sort of thing was happening.
[01:19:07.512 --> 01:19:17.581]  And what reminded me, brought it back to me, is I picked up an old book by John Buchan, who wrote the famous spy thriller, The 39 Steps.
[01:19:17.581 --> 01:19:20.024]  This book was printed in 1916, called Green Mantle.
[01:19:22.879 --> 01:19:33.362]  And the plot was that the Kaiser was going to set something like this up, you know, to drive the British out of Turkey.
[01:19:33.362 --> 01:19:37.503]  And I know those are novels, but both of those people were well nuts.
[01:19:37.503 --> 01:19:39.823]  Sure, so bottom line, what are you saying about World War I?
[01:19:39.823 --> 01:19:42.344]  What are you saying about the Muslims?
[01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:45.845]  I'm saying that some of these people in British intelligence
[01:19:46.713 --> 01:19:48.355]  We're converts.
[01:19:48.355 --> 01:19:51.219]  Now as to Lawrence of Arabia, I don't know it.
[01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:55.885]  Oh yeah, but we know a bunch of Masons became Muslims as well, and didn't Napoleon?
[01:19:55.885 --> 01:19:58.729]  Oh sure, a lot of folks do end up converting to Islam, and that is true.
[01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:59.610]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.822 --> 01:20:06.284]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:20:06.284 --> 01:20:15.166]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:23.009]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:20:23.009 --> 01:20:30.391]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[01:20:30.891 --> 01:20:34.854]  I personally store and use their high-quality products.
[01:20:34.854 --> 01:20:39.037]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[01:20:53.407 --> 01:20:57.450]  It is essential to prepare with My Patriot Supply today.
[01:21:00.268 --> 01:21:03.931]  It's been said, those who control the food, control the people.
[01:21:03.931 --> 01:21:07.754]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[01:21:07.754 --> 01:21:13.939]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina, weight gain, and the inability to think clearly.
[01:21:13.939 --> 01:21:21.345]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system.
[01:21:21.445 --> 01:21:24.147]  Which accounts for 80% of your immune system.
[01:21:24.147 --> 01:21:28.790]  Take back control of your health with Pro-EM1 Probiotic from Terragenics.
[01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:38.976]  Pro-EM1 Probiotic helps protect your body against irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, diabetes, the common cold, and much more.
[01:21:38.976 --> 01:21:50.463]  And including a powerful probiotic like Pro-EM1 as part of your daily routine puts you back in control and prevents you from becoming a mindless zombie manipulated by the pharmaceutical and GMO agendas.

[01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:30.481]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:23:30.481 --> 01:23:34.983]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:23:34.983 --> 01:23:40.704]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:23:40.704 --> 01:23:44.265]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:23:44.265 --> 01:23:46.946]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:46.946 --> 01:23:51.907]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:23:51.907 --> 01:23:52.147]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:52.147 --> 01:23:53.508]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:24:00.649 --> 01:24:07.031]  So folks, the Democrats have come out and said that they're warming to it.
[01:24:07.031 --> 01:24:10.752]  They like the fact that it doesn't work.
[01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:33.691]  And they like the fact it's doubling everybody's premiums.
[01:24:33.691 --> 01:24:46.538]  And you've heard them call into this show and you've seen them comment on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that actually this is a master plan by their leader to wreck the old corrupt system and to finally bring them something good later.
[01:24:46.538 --> 01:24:56.805]  So just like Stalin told folks and then of course other people before him like Lenin and Mao later in China, it's going to be horrible but later it's going to get better for you.
[01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:58.606]  And of course it just gets worse.
[01:24:58.606 --> 01:25:00.347]  So they are really buying into that.
[01:25:01.327 --> 01:25:04.350]  Uh, and they're saying that it's now not a dirty word.
[01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:05.671]  That's what Fox News is saying.
[01:25:05.671 --> 01:25:09.655]  Delay is suddenly not a dirty word at the White House.
[01:25:09.655 --> 01:25:11.076]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:25:11.076 --> 01:25:14.999]  And then I've got special guests in studio who say they support
[01:25:15.839 --> 01:25:25.222]  Mandatory vaccination and they're going to be out in the streets of Austin, where I live, promoting that children take more shots because, well, you heard them say, I'm going to actually play the local newscast.
[01:25:25.222 --> 01:25:26.382]  I'm not joking here.
[01:25:26.382 --> 01:25:28.203]  Mercury is good for children.
[01:25:28.203 --> 01:25:33.284]  These people believe mercury is good for your brain and makes you behave yourself like a good zombie.
[01:25:33.284 --> 01:25:34.264]  Mike in Louisiana.
[01:25:34.264 --> 01:25:34.845]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:25:34.845 --> 01:25:35.605]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:25:35.605 --> 01:25:36.085]  You're on the air.
[01:25:38.072 --> 01:25:43.074]  Yes, Alex, Mike, InfoWagon, Roving InfoWagon.
[01:25:43.074 --> 01:25:48.096]  I want to thank you for giving me a boost, the contributions that came in.
[01:25:48.096 --> 01:25:51.577]  I'd also like to give you a little history of myself.
[01:25:51.577 --> 01:25:55.079]  I'm a 66-year-old artist activist.
[01:25:55.079 --> 01:25:59.240]  You're a terror activist?
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.641]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:00.641 --> 01:26:05.863]  Some of my designs are hanging in my gallery on Royal Street, which is
[01:26:06.664 --> 01:26:09.106]  Kind of surprising me because they're rather provocative.
[01:26:09.106 --> 01:26:15.051]  I'd like to send you some of them of my best designs also as a thank you for what you've done so far.
[01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:16.972]  You bet, brother!
[01:26:16.972 --> 01:26:17.213]  P.O.
[01:26:17.213 --> 01:26:19.414]  Box 19549, Austin, TX 78760.
[01:26:19.414 --> 01:26:22.537]  We have fine Liberty art hanging all over the office.
[01:26:22.537 --> 01:26:26.640]  In fact, so much of it we're finding new places to hang it.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.641]  But thank you so much.
[01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:29.623]  Did you want to comment on Obamacare or anything?
[01:26:30.697 --> 01:26:41.760]  Well, yes, and I'd also like to go ahead and give you... I do what you do on the streets without the protection of walls or a gun on me.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.020]  I've thought about packing.
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:46.541]  I do carry my mace and my rod and my knife.
[01:26:46.541 --> 01:26:47.442]  How dare you!
[01:26:48.662 --> 01:26:54.911]  I parked my wagon right in front of the Supreme Court building next to the police department.
[01:26:54.911 --> 01:27:02.322]  The other day I gave you stories about some of the good responses, but I gotta tell you, there isn't a day that goes by I'm not called a racist.
[01:27:02.322 --> 01:27:03.384]  I don't do battles.
[01:27:03.764 --> 01:27:15.228]  And for new listeners that joined us and weren't here when you called in last week, you have a bicycle hooked to a two-sided big plasma screen TV with audio speakers playing my show, my videos, my films.
[01:27:15.228 --> 01:27:19.330]  And you go around and you said you get very positive stuff from the military and others now.
[01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:22.051]  You were saying overwhelmingly positive, but you're saying some of it's negative.
[01:27:22.051 --> 01:27:25.512]  And yes, any criticism, if you say Obamacare is a scam,
[01:27:26.272 --> 01:27:27.253]  Because it is a scam.
[01:27:27.253 --> 01:27:27.973]  You're a racist.
[01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:31.416]  If you say you don't want to give your kids vaccines, you're a racist.
[01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:39.621]  My wife was told by family, not all our families like this, they're great folks, but some of her distant family, that Christianity is inherently racist.
[01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:41.042]  And she said, well, how is it racist?
[01:27:41.042 --> 01:27:43.504]  You mean you could say it's bigoted or you don't agree with it?
[01:27:43.504 --> 01:27:44.184]  No, no, no.
[01:27:44.184 --> 01:27:47.566]  Hobby Lobby is racist because they're not open on Sundays.
[01:27:47.566 --> 01:27:52.310]  So it's literally a weapon that these people use because they don't have any intellectual argument.
[01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:55.512]  It's a cult of authoritarians calling themselves liberal.
[01:27:56.494 --> 01:27:58.864]  And so, briefly, tell us what happened to you.
[01:28:00.117 --> 01:28:02.138]  Well, I countered them.
[01:28:02.138 --> 01:28:09.120]  Like, I'll have a poster there of Obama giving immunity to the Bush administration for war crimes.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:14.181]  I've actually had some of the bomb-a-bots look at that and say, oh, that isn't true.
[01:28:14.181 --> 01:28:15.522]  And then I challenged them.
[01:28:15.522 --> 01:28:18.363]  I said, well, let's get on the computer here and take a look at it.
[01:28:18.363 --> 01:28:22.284]  And they'll walk away like I have AIDS or something.
[01:28:22.284 --> 01:28:22.904]  They're trying to get away.
[01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:28.666]  Well, yeah, because their false identity that they're winners, they're with Obama, that's fantasy.
[01:28:29.608 --> 01:28:33.431]  Like buying the lottery ticket and I'm going to win 5 million dollars this week, and of course you don't.
[01:28:33.431 --> 01:28:34.972]  It's one chance out of a billion.
[01:28:34.972 --> 01:28:36.113]  It doesn't matter.
[01:28:36.113 --> 01:28:40.336]  For that one week they can fantasize what they're going to do with a billion dollars.
[01:28:40.336 --> 01:28:41.016]  I can't tell you.
[01:28:41.016 --> 01:28:43.999]  About half the people I know in Austin are musicians, talented.
[01:28:43.999 --> 01:28:46.881]  They all imagine they're going to be rock stars or rap stars or whatever it is.
[01:28:47.481 --> 01:28:51.424]  And they run around in circles all day saying, I can't wait till I'm famous.
[01:28:51.424 --> 01:28:57.369]  And some of them are like 55 years old and don't even have a band, but they really think they're going to be famous.
[01:28:57.369 --> 01:29:03.473]  Why don't they go out and love what they're doing and have a good time with it, or teach kids how to play instruments or whatever?
[01:29:03.473 --> 01:29:04.174]  No, no, no.
[01:29:04.174 --> 01:29:09.698]  They feel unfulfilled until they have become rock stars.
[01:29:09.698 --> 01:29:15.603]  And we're a nation of imaginary wannabe delusional narcissists and because they can't have it,
[01:29:16.323 --> 01:29:17.804]  There's a new mental illness I'm seeing.
[01:29:17.804 --> 01:29:19.545]  Well, it's an old mental illness, but it's intensifying.
[01:29:19.545 --> 01:29:26.230]  I don't know what you call it, where people actually decide they're famous when they're not, and then just are mean to people to have power over them.
[01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:27.651]  It's pretty sick, but keep it up.
[01:29:27.651 --> 01:29:28.752]  Great job.
[01:29:28.752 --> 01:29:32.355]  Doesn't matter if the sheeple laugh at you.
[01:29:32.355 --> 01:29:32.895]  They don't count.
[01:29:32.895 --> 01:29:35.217]  I mean, these people can't even stand up at the White House.
[01:29:35.217 --> 01:29:35.397]  I mean...
[01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:41.436]  I mean, the average Democratic follower is so dumbed down, even though they're a young woman, they can't even stand up.
[01:29:41.436 --> 01:29:44.418]  And before she fell over, she was like, ooooh!
[01:29:44.418 --> 01:29:46.740]  Probably had 500 vaccine, probably doesn't even know.
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:48.102]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:29:48.102 --> 01:29:49.943]  Well, under common core, it doesn't.
[01:29:49.943 --> 01:29:51.325]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.325 --> 01:29:53.867]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.867 --> 01:29:56.529]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.215 --> 01:30:06.676]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[01:30:06.676 --> 01:30:15.578]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:30:15.578 --> 01:30:23.399]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[01:30:23.399 --> 01:30:30.781]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[01:30:35.262 --> 01:30:39.443]  It tastes great, and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.

[01:33:20.849 --> 01:33:31.742]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.742 --> 01:33:32.383]  Well, my friends,
[01:33:33.422 --> 01:33:39.107]  The federal government has financed the Journal of Pediatrics twice to come out and say that mercury is good for brain tissue.
[01:33:39.107 --> 01:33:51.058]  It doesn't matter that mercury is one of the most documented heavy metals to be totally destructive to brain tissue and actually cause electrochemical explosions in the brain.
[01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:55.402]  And we've written countless news articles about that showing electron microscope film footage.
[01:33:55.942 --> 01:34:02.924]  Of what tiny amounts of mercury, the type that's in vaccines, the thimerosal does to the brain.
[01:34:02.924 --> 01:34:16.768]  But when the government says mercury is good for your learning and behavior, they mean learning how to be a dumbed down zombie, learning how to go to the White House and collapse because you're so damaged from the GMO, the fluoride in the water.
[01:34:18.028 --> 01:34:24.215]  And, uh, the bromine, the, uh, lack of, uh, proper nascent iodine, uh, and just the horrible diet.
[01:34:24.215 --> 01:34:26.096]  I mean, we are a cursed nation, that's a fact.
[01:34:26.096 --> 01:34:37.348]  But before I get to this breaking news that I have in studio, folks that actually support going around trying to get kids to take more vaccines, uh, ghoulish-type characters, lunatics in my view, in my opinion, I don't think it is my opinion,
[01:34:37.868 --> 01:34:38.888]  Crazies.
[01:34:38.888 --> 01:34:40.849]  I want to play you some other crazies.
[01:34:40.849 --> 01:34:44.150]  This is CBS News locally, but again, this aired all over the country locally.
[01:34:44.150 --> 01:34:51.872]  It's a package produced nationally that local teleprompter readers read, because in PSYOPs, you believe locals more than national.
[01:34:51.872 --> 01:35:00.054]  But remember, these are really national folks parroting what came from the national talking point, that mercury is good for your brain.
[01:35:00.054 --> 01:35:05.275]  And remember, Obama said Obamacare is performing better than thought, and it's really doing great right now.
[01:35:06.215 --> 01:35:07.036]  Mercury is good.
[01:35:07.036 --> 01:35:07.977]  Obamacare is great.
[01:35:07.977 --> 01:35:11.221]  Raising the debt ceiling does not raise the debt ceiling.
[01:35:11.221 --> 01:35:12.903]  The founding fathers are bad.
[01:35:12.903 --> 01:35:13.763]  Freedom is bad.
[01:35:13.763 --> 01:35:15.045]  Tyranny is good.
[01:35:15.045 --> 01:35:19.730]  Drink your fluoride, even though the Harvard study admits it gives you cancer and lowers your IQ.
[01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:22.393]  But we need your IQ lowered under Common Core.
[01:35:22.393 --> 01:35:23.514]  They teach that in the public schools.
[01:35:23.514 --> 01:35:24.195]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[01:35:26.186 --> 01:35:27.787]  And if you don't agree with that, you're racist.
[01:35:27.787 --> 01:35:30.430]  So, let's go ahead and go to this CBS clip.
[01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:31.030]  Here it is.
[01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:37.156]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:35:37.156 --> 01:35:44.382]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:35:44.382 --> 01:35:51.268]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:35:51.428 --> 01:35:58.051]  And of course, Ted Turner wants 90% of us dead, so I guess improved mental behavior is you're in a coffin.
[01:35:58.051 --> 01:36:02.214]  So, I mean, this is the craziness we're dealing with.
[01:36:02.214 --> 01:36:06.296]  I'm crazy because I have medical doctors on exposing what's really happening.
[01:36:06.296 --> 01:36:18.422]  Now, if you go to the CDC and just type in vaccine side effects, you'll get the major vaccines that are out there, and there's thousands of pages, but just the synopsis
[01:36:19.162 --> 01:36:31.051]  Uh, is more than 30 pages long, and it's got death, headaches, stuffy nose, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, uh, blood in your inner stool, pneumonia, inflammation of stomach and intestines.
[01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:33.112]  Yeah, how about Crohn's disease?
[01:36:33.112 --> 01:36:35.654]  Uh, you can get, uh, you know, just all sorts of stuff.
[01:36:35.654 --> 01:36:46.522]  Death, headaches, fatigue, uh, Guillain-Barre, uh, seizures, permanent seizures, fussiness, vomiting, tiredness, autoimmune disorders.
[01:36:47.522 --> 01:36:51.423]  You can just go through all the wonderful things.
[01:36:51.423 --> 01:36:57.445]  Fevers, brain damage, the list just goes on and on.
[01:36:57.445 --> 01:36:58.906]  All the horrible things it does to you.
[01:36:58.906 --> 01:37:05.948]  Of course, Gardasil can kill you, cause brain damage, autoimmune disorders.
[01:37:05.948 --> 01:37:09.909]  So, you know, I just suggest that you go and check all this out.
[01:37:09.909 --> 01:37:12.130]  Because with other drugs, deafness!
[01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:19.473]  Long-term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness, permanent brain damage.
[01:37:19.473 --> 01:37:25.536]  Every year before school they put out, paid-for magazine, newspaper, TV thing, saying there are no side effects.
[01:37:25.536 --> 01:37:26.916]  Alex Jones is a lying scumbag.
[01:37:26.916 --> 01:37:28.157]  We've read these articles.
[01:37:28.157 --> 01:37:29.537]  Other people are lying scumbags.
[01:37:29.537 --> 01:37:32.739]  Dr. Blaylock, brain surgeon, went on Alex Jones.
[01:37:32.739 --> 01:37:34.119]  AP reported he's horrible.
[01:37:34.119 --> 01:37:37.441]  He said it's causing autism and brain damage and he's a big fat liar.
[01:37:37.441 --> 01:37:39.382]  I mean, here we are just reading from
[01:37:40.422 --> 01:37:42.767]  From the documents themselves.
[01:37:42.767 --> 01:37:50.802]  I could just keep going here with the death and the nausea and the neurological disorders and just everything else that this stuff does.
[01:37:52.073 --> 01:38:03.523]  And then of course they have a multi-billion dollar fund that if you can jump through thousands of hoops, and if your doctor does his job and reports it was the vaccine, then they'll pay you out a paltry sum for your brain-damaged child.
[01:38:03.523 --> 01:38:11.930]  And they make you sign a vaccine adverse events reporting system to see what's going on, to fine-tune their vaccines so they don't openly damage you right away.
[01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:16.134]  They want you to crawl off and die a long, painful death that the medical system can suck all your money out.
[01:38:16.494 --> 01:38:20.676]  First, while your child has to have their diapers changed until they're 35 and then finally die.
[01:38:20.676 --> 01:38:22.858]  So that's all part of the plan right there.
[01:38:22.858 --> 01:38:25.699]  Just thought you might want to know about all that.
[01:38:25.699 --> 01:38:32.283]  And we have right here for the flu shot itself from the CDC.gov all the things it can do to you.
[01:38:32.283 --> 01:38:35.264]  Guillain-Barré's, seizures, deaths.
[01:38:37.106 --> 01:38:49.960]  All sorts of thyroid problems, hives, angina, heart problems, neurological disorders, being paralyzed.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.185]  Just some really, really fun stuff here that's going to go on.
[01:38:55.543 --> 01:39:01.450]  Now, all that said, the flu shot never protects you from the actual flu that's out there.
[01:39:01.450 --> 01:39:06.436]  It actually lowers your immunity and doubles your chances the next year of getting the regular seasonal flu.
[01:39:06.436 --> 01:39:09.880]  That's a major Canadian-British joint study, and there's also U.S.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.921]  studies showing that.
[01:39:12.762 --> 01:39:17.246]  We would send out the crew to some of the local places that are pushing.
[01:39:17.246 --> 01:39:18.827]  I mean, hey, want 10% off your bill?
[01:39:18.827 --> 01:39:19.467]  Take a shot.
[01:39:19.467 --> 01:39:21.469]  We get kickbacks from the government that wants to hurt you.
[01:39:21.469 --> 01:39:23.951]  Of course, the average person working there doesn't know this.
[01:39:23.951 --> 01:39:35.540]  Or, hey, fluoride for babies in the water or in the formula, when they've said for seven years, don't give it to children to age five, and it lowers IQ and makes their teeth have fluorosis when their teeth erupt.
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:36.461]  But, you know, so what?
[01:39:36.461 --> 01:39:38.803]  I mean, who needs an IQ?
[01:39:38.803 --> 01:39:39.984]  So we're going to be handing out
[01:39:41.192 --> 01:39:44.133]  These flyers says, know the risk of the flu shot.
[01:39:44.133 --> 01:39:49.114]  The CDC website admits the following concerning the seasonal flu shot.
[01:39:49.114 --> 01:39:52.674]  You could get Guillain-Barre syndrome from the flu shot.
[01:39:52.674 --> 01:39:54.255]  And it says, source CDC.gov.
[01:39:54.255 --> 01:39:55.435]  We just showed you that.
[01:39:55.435 --> 01:39:57.535]  Serious reactions can occur from getting the shot.
[01:39:57.535 --> 01:39:59.036]  Reactions include breathing problems.
[01:39:59.036 --> 01:40:00.436]  Well, who needs to breathe?
[01:40:00.436 --> 01:40:05.037]  Horseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, and fast heartbeat or dizziness.
[01:40:05.937 --> 01:40:09.398]  Uh, sure, but of course, Guillaume Baret being paralyzed, that's fine.
[01:40:09.398 --> 01:40:13.999]  Uh, and it goes on to, you can get sick from the shot and even get the flu after receiving the shot.
[01:40:13.999 --> 01:40:19.940]  We actually show actuaries, again, insurance companies know, right after the shots roll out, that's when it starts.
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:26.201]  Just like, they've got to keep polio going, so they give live polio vaccines still, with live cancer virus in it.
[01:40:26.201 --> 01:40:28.982]  And they've got it down to where it's a footnote in the paper.
[01:40:28.982 --> 01:40:32.643]  Yeah, 60 plus thousand kids got paralyzed, a bunch of them died after the...
[01:40:33.604 --> 01:40:35.886]  After the shots, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in India.
[01:40:35.886 --> 01:40:37.547]  Just don't worry about it.
[01:40:37.547 --> 01:40:41.270]  But by the way, a cop dropped a ham sandwich.
[01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:44.733]  Let's have a parade for it.
[01:40:44.733 --> 01:40:45.554]  I think that's normal.
[01:40:45.554 --> 01:40:47.315]  I think that's good.
[01:40:47.315 --> 01:40:56.142]  So, we now have with us Nurse Death and Prozac the Killer Clown.
[01:40:56.142 --> 01:40:59.685]  Both of them are here in studio with us today.
[01:41:00.866 --> 01:41:15.384]  And you guys are going to now be going out to different facilities around Austin, encouraging people to take their vaccines, but actually giving them little handouts with what the disorders are, because they won't tell you there's any adverse reactions.
[01:41:15.384 --> 01:41:19.328]  Notice with any other drug, they admit all the bad stuff it can do to you on the TV ad.
[01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:20.570]  Yeah, totally.
[01:41:36.717 --> 01:41:44.462]  Human papillomaviruses, SV40 viruses that they admit gave a hundred million people cancer and killed most of them.
[01:41:44.462 --> 01:41:48.044]  That's all public, but I think you guys may be right.
[01:41:48.044 --> 01:41:50.086]  We should have people take more shots.
[01:41:50.086 --> 01:41:55.469]  We should trust these people and take their injections and let them lie to us and say there's no adverse reaction.
[01:41:55.469 --> 01:41:57.931]  So nurse death, I'm very proud of the work you're doing.
[01:41:57.931 --> 01:41:59.432]  Actually, I think you guys are really
[01:41:59.932 --> 01:42:01.893]  Doing a horrible thing out there.
[01:42:01.893 --> 01:42:04.954]  And we have Prozac, the killer clown, here with us.
[01:42:04.954 --> 01:42:12.578]  And guys, tell us about why you support this and want to get the kids to take their shots and then get a lollipop.
[01:42:14.051 --> 01:42:16.273]  Thanks for having us on here, Alex.
[01:42:16.273 --> 01:42:21.257]  I just wanted to say, oh man, what a theme park of suffering you just went through there!
[01:42:21.257 --> 01:42:22.699]  That was beautiful!
[01:42:22.699 --> 01:42:24.160]  I love side effects!
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:25.861]  I love hearing about them!
[01:42:25.861 --> 01:42:27.883]  And thank you for bringing them all out!
[01:42:27.883 --> 01:42:41.555]  I mean, myself, this morning, I had bloating, my ulcer exploded, I had some gas, but the nurse death, she put some stuff in me, I'm not sure if it's me or the stuff she's put in me that made me feel worse, but... You have irritable bowel and trail of diarrhea behind you?
[01:42:41.795 --> 01:42:42.875]  Oh, absolutely!
[01:42:42.875 --> 01:42:44.736]  They have to get the mop in here!
[01:42:44.736 --> 01:42:46.836]  Anyway, what a wonderful thing!
[01:42:46.836 --> 01:42:52.118]  One thing you didn't mention was the formaldehyde that causes cancer.
[01:42:52.118 --> 01:42:52.978]  Oh, man!
[01:42:52.978 --> 01:42:54.718]  My favorite.
[01:42:54.718 --> 01:42:55.619]  Oh!
[01:42:55.619 --> 01:42:56.759]  You gotta love that!
[01:42:56.759 --> 01:43:06.261]  Boy, you know, instead of just giving the kids lollipops for a Pavlovian response of getting their IQ reduction shot, could we have formaldehyde lollipops and just kill them right there on the spot?
[01:43:06.261 --> 01:43:09.202]  What I'd like to see is everybody just dress up as guinea pigs.
[01:43:09.602 --> 01:43:12.986]  Because I see all of you stupid guinea pigs!
[01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:23.558]  And if we could just load you up, every one of you, if you could just put some kind of guinea pig uniform on, or maybe a limping thing, jump off a cliff, as you're suffering from... Well, that would be nice.
[01:43:23.558 --> 01:43:29.125]  Ted Turner would actually like to just kill us right out, but... But, I mean, John Beholder says we do it to the water in the shots instead.
[01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:32.772]  Yes, Ted Turner pushed me down a flight of stairs.
[01:43:32.772 --> 01:43:34.295]  No, I'm just kidding!
[01:43:34.295 --> 01:43:39.626]  I don't know what happened to me yesterday because of all the side effects, but... But isn't it great?
[01:43:39.626 --> 01:43:40.989]  Hey, hey, wait a minute.
[01:43:40.989 --> 01:43:41.931]  Who needs nice teeth?
[01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:44.812]  Yeah, well you seem upset.
[01:43:44.812 --> 01:43:46.933]  Nurse, Nurse Deb, tell us why you're here.
[01:43:46.933 --> 01:43:51.116]  And I guess he's a little upset you're here to administer some more mercury.
[01:43:51.116 --> 01:43:51.336]  Yes.
[01:43:51.336 --> 01:43:53.677]  Because we just heard from CBS News it's good for kids.
[01:43:53.677 --> 01:43:59.140]  Everyone should have their daily dose of cancer and mental confusion as well as diabetes.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:43:59.561]  How's that feel?
[01:43:59.561 --> 01:44:01.422]  Go ahead and give him a shot.
[01:44:01.422 --> 01:44:02.062]  How's that feel?
[01:44:02.062 --> 01:44:03.563]  Oh, you should be feeling dizzy.
[01:44:03.563 --> 01:44:06.305]  I'm completely confused!
[01:44:06.305 --> 01:44:06.705]  I love it!
[01:44:07.986 --> 01:44:09.247]  You love the new Obamacare.
[01:44:09.247 --> 01:44:09.807]  Is it free?
[01:44:09.807 --> 01:44:10.768]  Seizures.
[01:44:10.768 --> 01:44:11.568]  Oh, it's totally free!
[01:44:11.568 --> 01:44:12.789]  Just get on the computer!
[01:44:12.789 --> 01:44:13.769]  Anybody's computer!
[01:44:13.769 --> 01:44:17.271]  Well, they now say they're going to refuse health care unless you take the vaccines.
[01:44:17.271 --> 01:44:20.413]  And they're also going to make, you know, Christian groups pay for abortions.
[01:44:20.413 --> 01:44:21.454]  Isn't that good?
[01:44:21.454 --> 01:44:22.814]  Oh, absolutely!
[01:44:22.814 --> 01:44:31.239]  In fact, all the churches... I'm so glad to see all the pastors giving in to what the money does for them instead of actually pushing Christian values.
[01:44:31.239 --> 01:44:32.980]  Who needs that bulk anyway?
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.060]  Who even needs kids?
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:38.821]  I mean, we could just inject the kids with mercury, like Jim Jones, and kill them all at the church.
[01:44:38.821 --> 01:44:40.362]  That would be... Oh, Joe!
[01:44:40.362 --> 01:44:41.522]  Why not just kill them right away?
[01:44:41.522 --> 01:44:46.523]  But I guess if you kill them real slow, though, and give them all these diseases and brain damage, then that's better.
[01:44:46.523 --> 01:44:51.524]  Explain to me, Nurse Death, why it's important to wreck their lives and make them die over 30 years, et cetera, right away.
[01:44:51.524 --> 01:44:55.125]  Well, polysorbate 80, right here, causes infertility.
[01:44:55.125 --> 01:44:58.505]  So, you know, just daily, a little dose of this, every flu season.
[01:44:58.505 --> 01:44:59.706]  I haven't been fertile since 1973!
[01:45:02.895 --> 01:45:06.016]  So Nurse Death, tell us about what you're going to be out there telling the public to do.
[01:45:06.016 --> 01:45:11.738]  You're going to pull up in the van, you're going to have candy for the kids, and you're going to say, I have mercury for you.
[01:45:11.738 --> 01:45:17.240]  And if the cops say, hey, mercury is dangerous, don't inject kids on the side of the road with mercury, you go, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's good for them.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.081]  This is part of Obamacare.
[01:45:19.081 --> 01:45:25.343]  I'm Nurse Death, here to administer... What's the big deal, man?
[01:45:25.343 --> 01:45:27.243]  A little seizure has never hurt anyone.
[01:45:27.243 --> 01:45:29.204]  Well, it's racist if you don't want to have a seizure.
[01:45:29.204 --> 01:45:30.264]  Exactly.
[01:45:30.264 --> 01:45:31.305]  Are you racist against...
[01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:34.966]  Brain damage and kidney failure?
[01:45:34.966 --> 01:45:37.967]  Yeah, somebody comes to me and says, hey, I've been taking all this Prozac.
[01:45:37.967 --> 01:45:40.547]  I feel so happy, but my diarrhea is out of control.
[01:45:40.547 --> 01:45:41.868]  You know what I say?
[01:45:41.868 --> 01:45:44.068]  Racist!
[01:45:44.068 --> 01:45:44.968]  Well, that's the answer.
[01:45:44.968 --> 01:45:51.410]  Actually, if you say Obamacare was written by foreign insurance companies and is only a fie on everybody and will wreck health care, they just scream racist.
[01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:52.630]  And it is racist.
[01:45:52.630 --> 01:45:52.971]  Completely.
[01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:57.432]  It's racist against the globalists that are trying to get a hold of the human population and kill everybody.
[01:45:57.432 --> 01:45:59.672]  Hey, nurse, hang on a- Big Pharma.
[01:45:59.672 --> 01:46:00.693]  Somebody call Obama.
[01:46:00.693 --> 01:46:01.693]  I think I'm gonna faint.
[01:46:03.018 --> 01:46:04.298]  Somebody get Obama here.
[01:46:04.298 --> 01:46:07.879]  Hey, look, you notice everybody on that stage looked like they couldn't tie their shoelaces.
[01:46:07.879 --> 01:46:09.399]  I guess they've been having their shots, huh?
[01:46:09.399 --> 01:46:12.000]  You know, only three of those people had actually signed up!
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.340]  Well, that's what it was, he has.
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:16.500]  He found six people.
[01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.141]  No, no, they think they signed up.
[01:46:18.141 --> 01:46:18.341]  Right!
[01:46:18.341 --> 01:46:23.342]  One of the six people in America that were able to get through, and he had them on stage.
[01:46:23.342 --> 01:46:24.022]  You gotta love it!
[01:46:24.022 --> 01:46:25.182]  Obama can't.
[01:46:25.182 --> 01:46:26.382]  It's just, they're glitches.
[01:46:26.382 --> 01:46:28.423]  They're just glitches in the system.
[01:46:28.423 --> 01:46:29.603]  Nothing wrong with a glitch.
[01:46:30.296 --> 01:46:38.238]  And thank heavens for Sebelius for coming out and explaining to the whole world, a week, well, from this week, that everything's fine.
[01:46:38.238 --> 01:46:40.979]  Enjoy your side effects.
[01:46:40.979 --> 01:46:48.182]  Uh, you know, if you're having a spasm of the lyrics, uh, Mike, am I hallucinating again?
[01:46:48.182 --> 01:46:50.722]  You just want him to suck your brain out, don't you?
[01:46:50.722 --> 01:46:53.463]  The vaccine just lovingly brain suck.
[01:46:53.463 --> 01:46:55.064]  Ah, there you go.
[01:46:55.064 --> 01:46:56.684]  No more pain.
[01:46:56.684 --> 01:46:58.625]  Say that Ragovela loves you.
[01:46:59.805 --> 01:47:04.148]  Somebody help me out here!
[01:47:04.148 --> 01:47:09.232]  Brains are good!
[01:47:09.232 --> 01:47:12.775]  I mean, that's not crazy to say mercury's good for your child's brain.
[01:47:12.775 --> 01:47:14.456]  I agree with CBS News.
[01:47:14.456 --> 01:47:15.417]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:47:15.417 --> 01:47:18.279]  You know, they're not misinformed at all.
[01:47:18.279 --> 01:47:18.979]  They're the news!
[01:47:20.222 --> 01:47:25.167]  Well, I like how... I mean, I know you worked in local TV, you know, before you became the clown.
[01:47:25.167 --> 01:47:26.788]  Yeah, as a cameraman!
[01:47:26.788 --> 01:47:31.073]  I like how they just, with straight faces, just openly say it's good for children.
[01:47:31.073 --> 01:47:33.235]  Well, it's not their job to know anything!
[01:47:33.235 --> 01:47:39.301]  I mean, it'd be like if the teleprompter said, and today we'll be human-sacrificing children on the news, and they're just like, oh, quite normal.
[01:47:39.861 --> 01:47:40.561]  Absolutely!
[01:47:40.561 --> 01:47:43.562]  Just get what's written for you and read it!
[01:47:43.562 --> 01:47:46.542]  They told him, report to the local FEMA camp, we're going to throw you in a wood chipper.
[01:47:46.542 --> 01:47:48.343]  I think they'd say that.
[01:47:48.343 --> 01:47:51.363]  And tonight, we'll be throwing your children in the wood chippers.
[01:47:51.363 --> 01:47:51.783]  Tonight at 7.
[01:47:51.783 --> 01:47:54.144]  Sounds like a new holiday to me!
[01:47:54.144 --> 01:47:58.344]  Sure make my job easier.
[01:47:58.344 --> 01:48:04.365]  Now talk about what you're going to be saying, especially to the children, because I know Nurse Death, you love them.
[01:48:04.365 --> 01:48:07.706]  So what are you going to say to the little kids when you're out there in front of the Walgreens and Walmarts?
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:09.721]  Say, come here, kiddies.
[01:48:09.721 --> 01:48:11.582]  Didn't you want a little brain damage?
[01:48:11.582 --> 01:48:13.063]  A little cancer?
[01:48:13.063 --> 01:48:15.044]  Didn't you hear about hair loss?
[01:48:15.044 --> 01:48:16.205]  What about that?
[01:48:16.205 --> 01:48:17.345]  Asthma?
[01:48:17.345 --> 01:48:17.986]  Nausea?
[01:48:17.986 --> 01:48:18.626]  Drought?
[01:48:18.626 --> 01:48:22.489]  Hey, they're already banning playtime and not letting you run at recess.
[01:48:22.489 --> 01:48:23.469]  How about Guillain-Barré?
[01:48:23.469 --> 01:48:24.850]  You'll be paralyzed!
[01:48:24.850 --> 01:48:25.911]  Pick your favorite!
[01:48:26.727 --> 01:48:28.388]  I've got several to choose from.
[01:48:28.388 --> 01:48:29.849]  Think you're going to grow up and have kids?
[01:48:29.849 --> 01:48:30.770]  No you're not!
[01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:32.952]  Pick your poison!
[01:48:32.952 --> 01:48:36.214]  I'm going to be making balloon animals for the kids.
[01:48:36.214 --> 01:48:42.279]  And of course all these animals will be afflicted with severe side effects.
[01:48:42.279 --> 01:48:44.100]  I want to give you the floor, Nurse Death.
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.462]  We've heard enough from Prozac the killer clown over there.
[01:48:48.769 --> 01:49:11.588]  Are you proud of the fact that he is the master drug that sub-derivatives of almost every shooter has been on and that he's never gotten the blame even though the insert says it'll make you commit mass murder and kill people and make you delusional and then you add it with Pentagon designed shoot-em-up killing games that teach you to have instinctive shooting and they go out and murder everybody and then we all get blamed for what Big Pharma does?
[01:49:12.088 --> 01:49:14.130]  I think he's doing a fantastic job.
[01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:22.235]  It's hilarious that we not only put it on the inserts, but we spell it right out for you in the commercials that it may cause mass murder.
[01:49:22.235 --> 01:49:24.717]  And people are like, oh my goodness, it's going to help me?
[01:49:24.717 --> 01:49:25.417]  I'm going to need that.
[01:49:25.417 --> 01:49:26.338]  You know, that's not a bow tie.
[01:49:26.338 --> 01:49:29.901]  That's actually a cancerous growth from the HPV shot.
[01:49:29.901 --> 01:49:32.502]  I inject him with ulcers daily.
[01:49:32.502 --> 01:49:34.024]  Who doesn't want a tumor that looks like that?
[01:49:34.024 --> 01:49:34.864]  Looks like a butterfly.
[01:49:34.864 --> 01:49:36.025]  Isn't that a beauty?
[01:49:36.025 --> 01:49:37.066]  It's a happy glitch.
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:42.701]  Let me ask you a question, Death.
[01:49:42.701 --> 01:49:44.923]  How handsome is Prozac the Killer Clown?
[01:49:44.923 --> 01:49:51.488]  I mean, tell all the other guys at beer commercials, if you look like this, and have the IQ of an amoeba, you will get the ladies.
[01:49:51.488 --> 01:49:59.113]  And if not, my shots here cause blindness and deafness, so, you know, who needs, who needs to even actually see this guy?
[01:49:59.113 --> 01:50:01.155]  He is quite a stud, though, I love the teeth.
[01:50:01.155 --> 01:50:02.135]  Just more SportsCenter for me!
[01:50:02.135 --> 01:50:03.196]  More fluoride!
[01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:09.621]  She's just talking about her, you know what, because I have, I'm completely sexually dysfunctional!
[01:50:09.621 --> 01:50:10.442]  I make sure of it.
[01:50:11.681 --> 01:50:13.203]  Well, I mean, what's wrong, seriously?
[01:50:13.203 --> 01:50:14.184]  It's squalene.
[01:50:14.184 --> 01:50:15.145]  I mean, I mean, what's wrong?
[01:50:15.145 --> 01:50:17.347]  The kids need more mercury.
[01:50:17.347 --> 01:50:17.867]  Absolutely.
[01:50:17.867 --> 01:50:27.117]  Well, when you're out handing these flyers out to folks that actually you're warning people, but I guess you guys are so brain damaged from all the vaccines, you don't know that.
[01:50:27.117 --> 01:50:28.539]  What else are you going to say to people, Nurse Death?
[01:50:29.329 --> 01:50:38.016]  People are into death, though, and they're into getting sick, and they're really into cancer, and raising awareness of cancer, so they might be into getting a shot.
[01:50:38.016 --> 01:50:43.020]  Yeah, not raising awareness to why it's exploding, but raising awareness to give it to the big companies that are actually behind it.
[01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:49.505]  Just be aware of how much we need you to get cancer, and to go get your flu shot so that we can increase our profits.
[01:50:49.505 --> 01:50:50.286]  So safe and effective.
[01:50:50.286 --> 01:50:51.607]  Safe and effective.
[01:50:51.607 --> 01:50:52.528]  Don't listen to people.
[01:50:52.528 --> 01:50:53.829]  There's no side effects.
[01:50:53.829 --> 01:50:54.349]  Exactly.
[01:50:54.349 --> 01:50:54.870]  Except death.
[01:50:55.532 --> 01:50:59.157]  And I'm pretty sure that even when we hand them out the side effects, they're going to be like, whoa!
[01:50:59.157 --> 01:50:59.978]  And they're going to walk away.
[01:50:59.978 --> 01:51:00.438]  Well, stay there.
[01:51:00.438 --> 01:51:00.679]  Stay there.
[01:51:00.679 --> 01:51:01.059]  Stay there.
[01:51:01.059 --> 01:51:06.286]  These are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[01:51:06.286 --> 01:51:07.928]  What are bitcoins?
[01:51:07.928 --> 01:51:13.936]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the Internet.
[01:51:14.396 --> 01:51:16.218]  No bank needed.
[01:51:16.218 --> 01:51:21.904]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[01:51:21.904 --> 01:51:24.186]  You are in control of your money.
[01:51:24.186 --> 01:51:25.347]  And the best part?
[01:51:25.347 --> 01:51:28.970]  You can start earning and making money with Bitcoins right away.
[01:51:28.970 --> 01:51:36.358]  No computer or expertise is required to earn money with Bitcoins and a growing number of merchants now accept Bitcoins.
[01:51:36.778 --> 01:51:40.859]  Plus, they're easily exchanged for dollars, euros, and more.

[01:52:00.265 --> 01:52:06.013]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:52:06.013 --> 01:52:13.403]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:52:13.403 --> 01:52:16.507]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:52:16.707 --> 01:52:18.729]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:52:18.729 --> 01:52:23.392]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:52:23.392 --> 01:52:26.314]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:52:26.314 --> 01:52:32.258]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:52:32.258 --> 01:52:35.940]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:41.184]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.

[01:52:44.366 --> 01:52:50.349]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[01:54:38.896 --> 01:54:42.999]  But I thought I'd show you from WebMD the official Prozac.
[01:54:42.999 --> 01:54:44.780]  And it's even worse with the other ones that came out of it.
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:53.209]  What it does, abnormal dreams, infrequent side effects they claim, fast heartbeat, chest pain, chronic trouble sleeping.
[01:54:54.198 --> 01:55:16.152]  And it goes on to say, hepatitis, bleeding of the stomach and intestines, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, confusion, having the excessive cheerfulness and activity, mild degree of mania, having thoughts of suicide, sun sensitive skin, loss of memory, mood changes, loss of one's sense of reality and identity.
[01:55:16.152 --> 01:55:16.993]  That's what they want.
[01:55:16.993 --> 01:55:19.034]  They got 20% of the public on it.
[01:55:19.034 --> 01:55:21.316]  So, Prozac, you're pretty excited about that.
[01:55:22.708 --> 01:55:29.411]  Well, they're putting kids as young as two on it, because they can see the pretty colors, too.
[01:55:29.411 --> 01:55:29.711]  Go ahead.
[01:55:40.762 --> 01:55:42.322]  You'll see a puppy or a kitty.
[01:55:42.322 --> 01:55:43.963]  Whichever one you like.
[01:55:43.963 --> 01:55:44.203]  Okay.
[01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:51.064]  And if you're small enough, baby, you'll have sudden infant death syndrome and you'll really sleep.
[01:55:51.064 --> 01:55:51.944]  Oh, joy!
[01:55:51.944 --> 01:55:53.664]  That's a little gift from the New World Order.
[01:55:53.664 --> 01:55:56.845]  And they get away with it, hidden in plain view, murdering everybody.
[01:55:56.845 --> 01:55:59.586]  Murdering, murdering, so liberal.
[01:55:59.586 --> 01:55:59.966]  Liberal.
[01:55:59.966 --> 01:56:00.626]  So liberal.
[01:56:00.626 --> 01:56:01.626]  I love murder.
[01:56:01.626 --> 01:56:03.226]  Oh, I love murder.
[01:56:03.226 --> 01:56:05.127]  Well, you've got to love the New World Order.
[01:56:05.127 --> 01:56:06.787]  They're really on to something, aren't they?
[01:56:07.725 --> 01:56:09.506]  Yeah, they know how to get us to go along with all this.
[01:56:09.506 --> 01:56:10.987]  All right, sickos.
[01:56:10.987 --> 01:56:13.067]  Seriously, get out there and warn everybody.
[01:56:13.067 --> 01:56:14.168]  Get their attention.
[01:56:14.168 --> 01:56:17.550]  You should call the media, too, and just say, we're going to be there in one hour.
[01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:21.892]  And then, you know, show up not on the property of Walmart or Walgreens, wherever you choose first, but out on the edge.
[01:56:21.892 --> 01:56:24.012]  They'll still run out until you can't be on the sidewalk.
[01:56:24.012 --> 01:56:27.134]  Just be polite when the cops get there and explain it all and show the tyranny.
[01:56:27.134 --> 01:56:29.355]  We're just here warning what you're doing in here, what you're pushing.
[01:56:29.355 --> 01:56:33.297]  Get people up with hepatitis and mercury in one hour.
[01:56:33.957 --> 01:56:36.960]  And also all the money we're going to be taking!
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.042]  All that Obamacare that you can't afford!
[01:56:40.042 --> 01:56:43.165]  We need to make that guy the head of Health and Human Services.
[01:56:43.165 --> 01:56:45.527]  They're ready to have you at Bohemian Grove.
[01:57:01.359 --> 01:57:02.759]  I appreciate what you're doing for all the kids.
[01:57:02.759 --> 01:57:03.780]  You killed quite a few.
[01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:04.500]  No, I didn't.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:05.500]  But named others.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.401]  Those are the lucky ones.
[01:57:06.401 --> 01:57:06.941]  Right, yeah.
[01:57:06.941 --> 01:57:08.002]  Actually, I shouldn't even joke.
[01:57:08.002 --> 01:57:08.862]  His parents are listening right now.
[01:57:08.862 --> 01:57:09.882]  They've had their kids killed by this.
[01:57:09.882 --> 01:57:10.863]  I've met them.
[01:57:10.863 --> 01:57:12.764]  But hey, go out and try to warn the pregnant women.
[01:57:12.764 --> 01:57:13.964]  Go out and warn the pregnant women.
[01:57:13.964 --> 01:57:14.464]  Be serious.
[01:57:14.464 --> 01:57:15.585]  Go out and warn people.
[01:57:15.585 --> 01:57:17.066]  This is a great way to get through to them.
[01:57:17.066 --> 01:57:19.367]  And whoever made up the idea, it's a good idea.
[01:57:19.367 --> 01:57:21.468]  Thanks for giving us the recognition we deserve.
[01:57:21.468 --> 01:57:22.288]  Whose idea was this?
[01:57:22.807 --> 01:57:24.728]  That'd be our producer Rob Dew.
[01:57:24.728 --> 01:57:27.069]  Lord Dew of InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:29.050]  Alright guys, go on, let folks see your outfits.
[01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:29.970]  Go ahead and stand up there.
[01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:32.972]  There you go, John.
[01:57:32.972 --> 01:57:37.534]  Go ahead and, uh... Oh, by the way, I forgot!
[01:57:37.534 --> 01:57:39.435]  What about this, the nascent iodine?
[01:57:39.435 --> 01:57:41.436]  That holds back the fluoride.
[01:57:41.436 --> 01:57:42.456]  And from InfoWarsLive.com...
[01:57:45.401 --> 01:57:47.603]  All right, I've driven them back.
[01:57:47.603 --> 01:57:49.245]  A little bit of ridiculousness.
[01:57:49.245 --> 01:57:54.750]  All right, we're going to come back, take a few phone calls, and get the Navy SEAL on, who went on Fox News last week.
[01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:58.974]  And he was there helping remove the barricades and with the speakers.
[01:57:58.974 --> 01:58:02.117]  And I got to meet one of the World War II vets that was there as well at the Alamo rally.
[01:58:02.117 --> 01:58:05.200]  We'll get his take, uncensored, coming up.
[01:58:06.503 --> 01:58:12.793]  But briefly, we are listener-supported here, folks, and we're just trying and testing different ways to try to wake people up.

[02:00:23.290 --> 02:00:27.433]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls right now.
[02:00:27.433 --> 02:00:29.454]  I've got a bunch of breaking news we'll get to as well.
[02:00:30.441 --> 02:00:33.522]  Hey Alex, first of all I want to say I'm a huge fan and that you're truly inspirational.
[02:00:59.246 --> 02:01:01.087]  Yeah, I see what you mean.
[02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:12.291]  Last spring I graduated high school and over the summer I was looking for work and I decided to become an insurance agent because a lot of people said that with the Affordable Care Act, that isn't so affordable, that I'd be able to make a lot of money in it.
[02:01:12.291 --> 02:01:17.773]  So I was just saying, I want you to elaborate on what you think are some of the biggest flaws with Obamacare.
[02:01:17.773 --> 02:01:20.494]  Maybe a time frame of when it will implode or something like that.
[02:01:20.894 --> 02:01:26.475]  Well, I mean, look, look, look, they can implement it any way they want, like all these big bills, these omnibus bills.
[02:01:26.475 --> 02:01:38.238]  It's got 10,000, now it's 12,000 pages of writers, it's a 3,000 page bill, and it's got gas panels, it's got the insurance companies wrote it to lower the standard of care and charge you more, make you buy it.
[02:01:38.238 --> 02:01:46.360]  I mean, when I say it's going to implode, it's going to implode the country, but they're going to, I mean, it's the biggest tax ever, a private corporate tax to offshore
[02:01:47.661 --> 02:01:58.404]  Banks that own the insurance companies of up to five or more thousand dollars a year per person and then you won't even get the health care and it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions and it just cheats everybody.
[02:01:58.404 --> 02:02:02.725]  I mean it is just the ultimate screw job and our health care system's gotten bad.
[02:02:02.725 --> 02:02:11.568]  It was the best in the world, nobody doubted that, because insurance companies and HMOs got involved and rigged it to begin with to overcharge people that have insurance
[02:02:13.177 --> 02:02:16.120]  And then, you know, screw up the charity care system.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:24.689]  So I don't know, but I mean, look, the computer system is designed to not work and the Obama supporters are already saying they like it not working.
[02:02:24.689 --> 02:02:26.531]  I mean, they're just, it's a cult.
[02:02:26.531 --> 02:02:29.694]  They would drink cyanide Kool-Aid in order to do so.
[02:02:29.694 --> 02:02:32.477]  And the Republican leadership attacked Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.
[02:02:32.477 --> 02:02:33.818]  They helped write it.
[02:02:33.818 --> 02:02:35.280]  They're owned by the same interest.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:35.940]  They want it.
[02:02:36.923 --> 02:02:39.344]  So, I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[02:02:39.344 --> 02:02:43.966]  I mean, tyrants get away with a lot once they're in charge, so I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:02:43.966 --> 02:02:47.287]  I mean, it's going to sink the country, I know that.
[02:02:47.287 --> 02:02:49.208]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:02:49.208 --> 02:02:50.148]  I really don't know.
[02:02:50.148 --> 02:02:51.709]  I just graduated high school last spring.
[02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:53.089]  I thought this would be a good opportunity.
[02:02:53.089 --> 02:02:59.031]  You know, my dad's been an insurance agent for 20 years, you know, and he said with the Affordable Care Act that everyone's going to need insurance.
[02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:02.953]  You know, from everything I'm hearing from you, I hear both sides of the story.
[02:03:02.953 --> 02:03:06.154]  I hear the insurance side, which everyone says is good, and then I hear your side.
[02:03:07.551 --> 02:03:15.016]  Well, listen, most insurance people I talk to are freaking out the last year because they've already seen it go up just in anticipation.
[02:03:15.016 --> 02:03:17.177]  They're now, on average, doubling people's premium.
[02:03:17.177 --> 02:03:20.479]  I mean, everybody I know, their premium's doubled.
[02:03:20.479 --> 02:03:22.040]  Everybody I know, their premium's doubled.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:25.842]  My dad's, mine, I mean, everybody.
[02:03:25.842 --> 02:03:28.083]  And we never even use our insurance.
[02:03:28.083 --> 02:03:31.585]  I had Roldo Rivera, big liberal, who supported it early on.
[02:03:31.585 --> 02:03:32.806]  He's got six employees.
[02:03:32.806 --> 02:03:33.427]  It's doubled.
[02:03:34.358 --> 02:03:35.679]  It's doubled already!
[02:03:35.679 --> 02:03:39.643]  Did you know it's set to double again by 2015?
[02:03:39.643 --> 02:03:40.724]  You think people can pay that?
[02:03:40.724 --> 02:03:41.725]  You think people can pay $20,000 a year?
[02:03:41.725 --> 02:03:45.408]  No, and then they're just going to get fined if they don't have it.
[02:03:45.408 --> 02:03:47.710]  So it's a lose-lose, basically.
[02:03:47.710 --> 02:03:48.491]  But it's a win-win.
[02:03:48.491 --> 02:03:53.656]  The insurance companies make everybody get it, they lower the quality, and the government gets to fine everybody that can't do it.
[02:03:54.738 --> 02:03:55.839]  They're gonna take your house.
[02:03:55.839 --> 02:03:56.580]  They're gonna take everything.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:57.941]  They're gonna garnish your wages.
[02:03:57.941 --> 02:04:00.202]  That's why they want a digital grid in.
[02:04:00.202 --> 02:04:06.267]  Once they have a digital grid in, once they can track everything, it's over.
[02:04:06.267 --> 02:04:07.188]  Okay?
[02:04:07.188 --> 02:04:13.133]  And we told you it was crashing two and a half weeks ago, a week before Forbes did, on purpose.
[02:04:13.133 --> 02:04:14.114]  It isn't a screw-up.
[02:04:15.202 --> 02:04:21.587]  They could have had chimpanzees on Mountain Dew and PCP with typewriters write better code, okay?
[02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:24.309]  The front works, there's nothing behind it.
[02:04:24.309 --> 02:04:27.632]  The only thing that works is getting your data, okay?
[02:04:27.632 --> 02:04:35.898]  It gets your data and it gets some type of, this is out today, some type of NSA data mine connection to your computer.
[02:04:35.898 --> 02:04:42.584]  They want to track who doesn't have insurance to now put you in a database to gang rape your paycheck.
[02:04:43.362 --> 02:04:44.423]  Okay, I mean, that's it.
[02:04:44.423 --> 02:04:47.747]  They were targeting you to get poor people's paychecks.
[02:04:47.747 --> 02:04:49.669]  I mean, it's incredible evil.
[02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:53.353]  That's what the Obama-care is, okay?
[02:04:53.353 --> 02:04:55.836]  And look, folks, people know I'm nonpartisan, I'm a libertarian.
[02:04:55.836 --> 02:04:57.418]  I've never seen anything like Obama.
[02:04:57.418 --> 02:04:59.200]  I mean, he is the worst president ever.
[02:05:00.928 --> 02:05:09.715]  Financial experts are certain that within 12 to 36 months, the American economy will collapse, pushing most Americans into terrifying poverty, like third-world slums.
[02:05:09.715 --> 02:05:22.165]  Facing this unstoppable horror and knowing so many are unprepared, a group of military vets, engineers, survival experts, and a former FDIC bank inspector pooled their knowledge and experience to create LocustsontheHorizon.com.

[02:08:12.397 --> 02:08:26.122]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.122 --> 02:08:30.784]  Benjamin Smith was on Fox News last week, and it made national news.
[02:08:30.784 --> 02:08:35.586]  Ex-Navy SEAL, government-provoking vets to bring on martial law.
[02:08:36.741 --> 02:08:41.003]  And he joins us right now.
[02:08:41.003 --> 02:08:51.346]  He, of course, was up there with the World War II vets and others for veterans' rights and against having the memorials that are open air and don't have security at them being purposely closed.
[02:08:51.346 --> 02:08:56.028]  We've had park officials say they were told to do that to, quote, make people as miserable as possible.
[02:08:56.028 --> 02:08:57.868]  That's an Associated Press headline.
[02:08:59.489 --> 02:09:05.531]  And he joins us to go over some of the things that are happening and going on.
[02:09:05.531 --> 02:09:10.933]  He's a veteran of quite a few different tours.
[02:09:10.933 --> 02:09:11.213]  U.S.
[02:09:11.213 --> 02:09:11.914]  Navy, 2000-2005.
[02:09:11.914 --> 02:09:13.314]  A SEAL, 2001.
[02:09:13.314 --> 02:09:17.836]  Served in Iraq, South America, and the Horn of Africa.
[02:09:17.836 --> 02:09:19.756]  I guess Somalian around there.
[02:09:19.756 --> 02:09:23.858]  And now he works, or has been working, as a private security company in Iraq.
[02:09:24.258 --> 02:09:25.178]  Since 2006.
[02:09:25.178 --> 02:09:31.461]  So I'd love to get him on sometime just to talk about what those experiences were like.
[02:09:31.461 --> 02:09:39.224]  But I wanted to get him on so we wouldn't just have a few minutes like Fox to spend 20 minutes with us and really break down what he saw at the memorials.
[02:09:41.565 --> 02:09:56.860]  The intel he's got from elected officials and others about the plan to try to get vets into some type of conflict with the federal government and how he thinks we can try to avert the bad situation this country has gotten into.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:58.642]  So Benjamin Smith, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:09:58.642 --> 02:10:02.206]  Okay, yeah man, it's good to be on.
[02:10:03.044 --> 02:10:08.229]  Um, yeah, ex-Navy SEAL, like if you hear ex, that usually means you've been kicked out.
[02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:13.333]  Um, I'm former, but you know... That's right, former, you didn't get kicked out, sure, yeah.
[02:10:13.333 --> 02:10:15.455]  I'm a veteran.
[02:10:15.455 --> 02:10:30.587]  Um, oh man, it's uh, this is, this is such a topic that is talked about within the movement, people who understand military and strategy and tactics.
[02:10:30.587 --> 02:10:31.068]  Uh, there's
[02:10:32.143 --> 02:11:01.361]  You know, most people, the conversation you hear amongst people you see speaking at rallies, at functions, even political people, elected officials, the conversation, it's kind of the conversation where you look over each shoulder and you start having the talk because you feel really uncomfortable having it, that in your country a logical conversation is now being had and has been for a bit.
[02:11:01.914 --> 02:11:24.040]  But you don't see it on any of the news things where the government might be trying to get you into a position that is the most painful for us, you know, like downturn of economies and all of trying to get us to provoke us to do something either violent or stupid.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:25.840]  There's always low hanging fruit.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.421]  You have them on the left, you have them on the right and
[02:11:31.004 --> 02:11:35.447]  They're trying to get those people to start doing something stupid.
[02:11:35.447 --> 02:11:38.589]  And, you know, at that point, they can shut us down.
[02:11:38.589 --> 02:11:55.862]  And, you know, whenever anyone says martial law, that kind of is buzzword for, say, lefty politicians, or a lot of people who aren't aware of anything, to just start saying, conspiracy theorists!
[02:11:55.862 --> 02:12:00.525]  These guys are nuts, a windbag, crazy, fringe, violent,
[02:12:01.243 --> 02:12:21.475]  You know, like all those things, and then if you do your research, and you look at what they've said, and, you know, just get down to the facts, instead of sounding rebellious, and you just have the logical conversation, you can logically go about pointing to things and say, yeah, that's what they're trying to do.
[02:12:21.475 --> 02:12:22.916]  It's obvious.
[02:12:22.916 --> 02:12:26.318]  And the conversation topics at that memorial was,
[02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:43.959]  You know, most veterans see this in conversations I have with, um, you know, people with a spec up background, not going to go into specifics on, on who, but within the, within the communities, you can see it.
[02:12:43.959 --> 02:12:51.386]  And it's, it's a, it's a logical conversation, not as in the topic of like, you know, we need to rebel and violence.
[02:12:51.386 --> 02:12:52.767]  No, that's not it.
[02:12:52.767 --> 02:12:54.228]  It's very much a logical.
[02:12:54.955 --> 02:12:55.996]  Here's what we see.
[02:12:55.996 --> 02:12:56.836]  Here's why.
[02:12:56.836 --> 02:12:58.117]  Here's what they've said.
[02:12:58.117 --> 02:12:59.277]  Here's what's happened.
[02:12:59.277 --> 02:13:01.358]  Here's who's it affected.
[02:13:01.358 --> 02:13:03.419]  And, you know, here's the outcome.
[02:13:03.419 --> 02:13:14.925]  And just in the pure analysis, a logical analysis of things that have been happening over the past, you know, you got five years because you've got Obama in office now.
[02:13:14.925 --> 02:13:17.647]  But if you trace it back, you can look all the way back to
[02:13:18.730 --> 02:13:23.936]  Um, you know, Russia and all, like, the Cold War, you know, like, things like that.
[02:13:23.936 --> 02:13:38.372]  It's, there's a lot of logical streams to where things are starting to come to a head now, and if we're uneducated and don't have the, uh, wherewithal to do our research, to read, to look at history and how it repeats itself,
[02:13:39.486 --> 02:13:42.011]  We are subject to losing everything.
[02:13:42.011 --> 02:13:43.393]  Absolutely.
[02:13:43.393 --> 02:13:48.443]  And, you know, it could be another 1200 years before anything that would resemble.
[02:13:49.313 --> 02:13:53.918]  Uh, freedom, um, you know, individual sovereignty would ever surface again.
[02:13:53.918 --> 02:13:55.719]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:13:55.719 --> 02:13:57.521]  Oh, I absolutely hear what you're saying.
[02:13:57.521 --> 02:14:00.984]  And again, veteran Navy SEAL Benjamin Smith is our guest.
[02:14:00.984 --> 02:14:06.249]  We should probably contact the folks with Biz Pacer Review because they do say ex-Navy SEAL.
[02:14:06.249 --> 02:14:09.933]  But most people, unless you've been in the military, just think that means former.
[02:14:09.933 --> 02:14:12.755]  But a veteran Navy SEAL joins us.
[02:14:13.656 --> 02:14:18.380]  Talk about, if you can, your colleagues, other veterans of the armed services.
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:20.082]  I know what I see.
[02:14:20.082 --> 02:14:22.904]  I know family I have that are in the military.
[02:14:22.904 --> 02:14:29.710]  I know what I get from Stuart Rhodes, the head of Oath Keepers, and countless other contacts I have, FBI agents.
[02:14:30.770 --> 02:14:35.251]  Former Secret Service agents, current, people like Dan Bongino.
[02:14:35.251 --> 02:14:39.012]  He says about half the enlisted he talks to are awake.
[02:14:39.012 --> 02:14:42.873]  About 60-70%, 80% of Special Warfare people.
[02:14:42.873 --> 02:14:56.997]  I was down at a San Antonio open carry rally this weekend and there were San Antonio cops there in plain clothes with their guns and there were Army PSYOPs people there saying almost everybody's awake and they said a year ago it was less than 50%.
[02:14:56.997 --> 02:14:59.338]  So I'm seeing a massive awakening
[02:14:59.858 --> 02:15:01.839]  Well, going back to the beginning of this administration,
[02:15:24.001 --> 02:15:48.882]  There were... I've had friends within the community talking about how they were brought in and, you know, questioned with people from, you know, more towards the top side, and the questioning resulted in kind of where the... where it was pointing was, you know, do you feel comfortable disarming American citizens?
[02:15:48.882 --> 02:15:51.725]  And you can see that now with the shutting of a lot of the
[02:15:52.766 --> 02:15:58.807]  Officers and stuff like that it's it's you know, we don't have the hundred percent track on it, but
[02:15:59.423 --> 02:16:03.506]  You know, there's a lot of funny things happening within military.
[02:16:03.506 --> 02:16:06.309]  Now that's bombshell, but I want to quantify that.
[02:16:06.309 --> 02:16:13.034]  I have Secret Service, FBI sources on record on the air, but also covert sources that are currently in.
[02:16:13.034 --> 02:16:14.776]  They say exactly that for two years.
[02:16:14.776 --> 02:16:22.142]  There is a litmus test where officers from the generals down to lieutenant generals, down to majors, down to sergeant,
[02:16:22.702 --> 02:16:23.883]  Yeah, and at this moment in this conversation, it's
[02:16:48.313 --> 02:16:51.856]  God, to bring it back to Van Jones.
[02:16:51.856 --> 02:16:53.877]  Oh yeah.
[02:16:53.877 --> 02:17:16.634]  Like, do you remember him when he said you have to like for us to have the argument or to just have the conversation logically and what he was saying with like the communists and the lefties and the everything that Van Jones is it's you drop the radical pose for the radical ends and just to translate that into what this is
[02:17:17.458 --> 02:17:29.762]  You know, I understand a lot of Libertarian Ron Paul, a lot of people that are your listeners, get like fervent and very strong about it.
[02:17:29.762 --> 02:17:34.764]  And it's not about, you know, being the person that's the loudest right there.
[02:17:34.764 --> 02:17:40.966]  Having that logical conversation to where someone else can reply and you can go back with facts.
[02:17:40.966 --> 02:17:45.387]  And it's a logical conversation that needs to be had.
[02:17:45.387 --> 02:17:46.728]  And it's starting to
[02:17:48.067 --> 02:17:58.310]  You know, like, I couldn't believe he asked, um, that, uh, Hemmer actually asked me on air about, you know, it was, it was kind of a surprise that he asked me.
[02:17:58.310 --> 02:18:04.212]  Like, you know, you'd think that the government's trying to declare martial law and sitting there going like, oh, Jesus, is this an ambush?
[02:18:04.212 --> 02:18:10.434]  If I answer this wrong, this is, you know, everything goes down the drain and I'm a, I'm a, I'm a kook.
[02:18:10.434 --> 02:18:17.536]  But the thing is, Sheila Jackson Lee, you always have somebody, if you've even got the tightest plan,
[02:18:18.362 --> 02:18:27.746]  There's always somebody who gives up the jig or says something that's more right to the point than anything else.
[02:18:27.746 --> 02:18:28.266]  Well, that's right.
[02:18:28.266 --> 02:18:32.828]  The rhetoric from the authoritarian left, because they're not really liberals.
[02:18:32.828 --> 02:18:34.349]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:36.070]  I see myself as a real liberal.
[02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.950]  More freedom.
[02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:39.251]  These people are not liberals.
[02:18:39.251 --> 02:18:41.292]  And that's all they talk about.
[02:18:41.872 --> 02:18:43.513]  is how they want to round up the Tea Party.
[02:18:43.513 --> 02:18:46.115]  I mean, that's in Forbes and the Washington Times.
[02:18:46.115 --> 02:18:49.137]  And then she gives a speech and talks about political martial law.
[02:18:49.137 --> 02:18:53.780]  Well, that's the first order of martial law is political before it becomes physical.
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:56.502]  And Obama says he may have to do stuff without Congress.
[02:18:56.502 --> 02:18:58.363]  And NATO is over our military.
[02:18:58.363 --> 02:18:59.864]  I'm just backing you up.
[02:18:59.864 --> 02:19:01.965]  Benjamin Smith joining us.
[02:19:01.965 --> 02:19:07.249]  Veteran Navy SEAL of just all over the Middle East and Africa.
[02:19:07.249 --> 02:19:08.069]  You name it.
[02:19:08.069 --> 02:19:08.750]  Joining us here.
[02:19:09.250 --> 02:19:11.011]  And he's really the tip of the spear.
[02:19:11.011 --> 02:19:18.716]  He's willing to openly say what most people I talk to have told me privately about their concern.
[02:19:18.716 --> 02:19:21.218]  But let's expand on this then.
[02:19:21.218 --> 02:19:30.964]  Studying warfare, studying psychological warfare, using truth, the ultimate weapon in that, having our gold, having the moral high ground, our goal for liberty.
[02:19:30.964 --> 02:19:32.685]  What do you think we should do then?
[02:19:34.026 --> 02:19:35.767]  I mean, I agree, it takes different folks.
[02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:41.472]  Some people get angry, some people are more logical reaching out, but what do we do to shake people out of their trance?
[02:19:41.472 --> 02:19:53.423]  What do we do to let people know that the new Army Training Manual, and I'll put it on screen, that Judicial Watch got two months ago, says George Washington wouldn't be welcome in today's Army.
[02:19:53.423 --> 02:19:56.786]  Well, George Washington founded the Army.
[02:19:56.786 --> 02:19:57.747]  Go ahead.
[02:19:57.747 --> 02:19:58.107]  What do we do?
[02:19:59.813 --> 02:20:28.688]  Well, you've got manuals, and it's just, to go to that point really quick, you've got, in the military, West Point, they have Pelliger, who now, there's a teaching doctrine where they're actually talking about moderate, right-wing conservatives as, you know, the military may have to actually, you know, quell
[02:20:29.582 --> 02:20:35.266]  American people, and that's what they're teaching the future leaders of the military.
[02:20:35.266 --> 02:20:55.400]  But what needs to happen is the military people who are having these conversations need to start stepping into the public sphere, the political sphere, like now the percentage of people who are in government
[02:20:56.625 --> 02:21:02.546]  is from the military is about like 15 to 20 percent and possibly even less.
[02:21:02.546 --> 02:21:09.427]  When, you know, even around Vietnam, after and before, it was over 75 percent.
[02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:10.587]  Well, that's a great point.
[02:21:10.587 --> 02:21:15.648]  We need veterans in the government, not lawyers.
[02:21:15.648 --> 02:21:21.649]  Yes, and the lawyers, you know, I don't want to, I don't want to, like, declare war on lawyers.
[02:21:21.649 --> 02:21:22.850]  You know, we absolutely need them.
[02:21:22.850 --> 02:21:24.470]  Sure, but the government types, sure.
[02:21:25.555 --> 02:21:26.918]  Yeah.
[02:21:26.918 --> 02:21:28.943]  Of course.
[02:21:28.943 --> 02:21:34.297]  The people need to understand that the veterans, at least in boot camp,
[02:21:34.679 --> 02:21:56.252]  Have gone through and eaten dirt, have had to get over their petty differences, race, orientation, whatever it may be that you have wrong with the person that's next to you, you've got to fulfill a mission, you've got something that you have to do, or you're all going to pay the man because of the screw-up that you're doing.
[02:21:56.252 --> 02:22:00.975]  And it's all about, like, unity and understanding, getting past your differences.
[02:22:00.975 --> 02:22:03.176]  The military folk have to start
[02:22:03.999 --> 02:22:17.788]  Reaching out to normal citizens and having that logical conversation of, instead of just being, because I remember when I came back, I was, you know, I would, I would be a little short with people that like, you don't get it.
[02:22:17.788 --> 02:22:22.010]  And it's like, it was hard to kind of get into the conversation.
[02:22:22.010 --> 02:22:23.992]  Like, how do you see this?
[02:22:23.992 --> 02:22:24.992]  This is how I see it.
[02:22:24.992 --> 02:22:26.353]  This is what I have seen.
[02:22:26.353 --> 02:22:27.654]  This is what I've read.
[02:22:27.654 --> 02:22:28.955]  This is how history has gone.
[02:22:29.725 --> 02:22:31.066]  It's kind of obvious.
[02:22:31.066 --> 02:22:46.037]  And then after talking with them and hearing what they have to say, it starts the back and forth and they start going like, oh, this guy isn't like some pipe hitting, you know, monkey that that runs around with no brain.
[02:22:46.037 --> 02:22:47.258]  There's there's thought there.
[02:22:47.258 --> 02:22:48.539]  And you know what?
[02:22:48.539 --> 02:22:52.082]  There's a there's a leadership that is in a lot of the military people.
[02:22:52.082 --> 02:22:53.603]  So that understanding
[02:22:54.505 --> 02:23:03.091]  That these people are trying to do the best, and they're a little angry that a lot of people don't get it.
[02:23:03.091 --> 02:23:13.218]  Military people need to start really stepping up and having the conversation as if you're sitting around a fireside chat, and the truth needs to come out.
[02:23:13.218 --> 02:23:16.120]  As uncomfortable as it is, it has to be logically approached.
[02:23:17.913 --> 02:23:31.563]  And we have to also realize that if you turn on any movie or almost any cartoon, it demonizes patriotic militia types, it demonizes libertarians, it demonizes people for 20 years that think a new world order is coming, a corporate global governance.
[02:23:31.563 --> 02:23:37.047]  They were preemptively brainwashing folks so that when the real threat came in, we wouldn't recognize it.
[02:23:37.047 --> 02:23:41.150]  We've got to get past caring what they say about us, because that is a psy-op.
[02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:46.913]  And I believe, and I know from the evidence, we're on the march, the public is waking up.
[02:23:46.913 --> 02:23:54.357]  That's why they do want to get some type of insurrection going, because we're politically starting to really wake people up.
[02:23:54.357 --> 02:24:01.522]  Take how MSNBC pushes racial division all day, and says if you don't support Obamacare, that's a total rip-off, you're racist.
[02:24:01.522 --> 02:24:03.563]  Again, they're trying to divide and conquer.
[02:24:03.563 --> 02:24:10.767]  So the answer is come together around the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the family, private property, the Second Amendment, free speech.
[02:24:11.227 --> 02:24:12.969]  I think that's the big solution.
[02:24:12.969 --> 02:24:15.591]  What else do you think is a solution?
[02:24:15.591 --> 02:24:18.713]  Well, they're promoting the reluctant anti-hero.
[02:24:18.713 --> 02:24:27.401]  You know, you see like in movies and all that kind of stuff, you know, and then they go right back to being a sack of poop.
[02:24:27.401 --> 02:24:34.687]  It's kind of like when how you live your life, you have to live your life like you want to be remembered.
[02:24:34.687 --> 02:24:38.690]  And it's just try to do the right thing at all times.
[02:24:38.690 --> 02:24:39.931]  You know, we're all going to mess up.
[02:24:40.604 --> 02:24:45.405]  Um, our side needs to circle the wagons around the people that it feels are worth it.
[02:24:45.405 --> 02:24:48.766]  Instead of, if you do one thing wrong, you're not us.
[02:24:48.766 --> 02:24:50.966]  You're giving us a bad name and they banish you.
[02:24:50.966 --> 02:24:51.807]  Exactly.
[02:24:51.807 --> 02:24:54.587]  There's, there's a mindset that you have to live by.
[02:24:54.587 --> 02:24:59.809]  I'm always going to do the best for the people who believe of what America is.
[02:24:59.809 --> 02:25:01.149]  Founding logic.
[02:25:01.149 --> 02:25:10.011]  Those people, those people, George Washington, Jefferson, Adams, all those guys, they lived through revolution, war on their land.
[02:25:10.743 --> 02:25:12.785]  And their families were killed.
[02:25:12.785 --> 02:25:13.986]  Everything was pillaged.
[02:25:13.986 --> 02:25:16.829]  It was more of a civil war than a revolution.
[02:25:16.829 --> 02:25:21.473]  You know, it was amongst ourselves for the direction of a country.
[02:25:21.473 --> 02:25:23.935]  And it was a battle of perseverance, too.
[02:25:23.935 --> 02:25:25.957]  It was who could go the longest.
[02:25:25.957 --> 02:25:32.363]  Yeah, and it always boils down to, you know, usually two options.
[02:25:32.363 --> 02:25:33.424]  Good, bad.
[02:25:33.424 --> 02:25:34.404]  Good, evil.
[02:25:34.404 --> 02:25:35.145]  Pull the trigger.
[02:25:35.145 --> 02:25:36.326]  Don't pull the trigger.
[02:25:36.326 --> 02:25:37.107]  Life, death.
[02:25:37.865 --> 02:25:38.586]  Eat.
[02:25:38.586 --> 02:25:39.066]  Starve.
[02:25:39.066 --> 02:25:39.526]  You know what I mean?
[02:25:39.526 --> 02:25:44.090]  Like, you want to bring it down to what's going on here, not 15 different options.
[02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.430]  Sure.
[02:25:44.430 --> 02:25:45.411]  Free or slave.
[02:25:45.411 --> 02:25:46.792]  And we know the direction we're going.
[02:25:46.792 --> 02:25:47.332]  Slavery.
[02:25:47.332 --> 02:25:48.513]  Let me ask you this in the time we have.
[02:25:48.513 --> 02:25:49.694]  We're going to give your website out.
[02:25:49.694 --> 02:25:52.336]  It's benjaminsmith.us.com.
[02:25:52.336 --> 02:25:54.517]  Benjaminsmith.us.com.
[02:25:54.517 --> 02:25:56.499]  Radio listeners want to go check that out.
[02:25:56.499 --> 02:25:59.121]  TV listeners can see it in the time we have.
[02:25:59.121 --> 02:26:01.482]  Get into what you were saying on Fox.
[02:26:02.583 --> 02:26:12.308]  Any other points you want to make about them trying to obviously make people mad, not letting them into the memorials, using more police than they would have there normally to keep them shut?
[02:26:12.308 --> 02:26:15.750]  I mean, that is clearly... What do you think they were wanting to do?
[02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:19.011]  What do you think Obama and his controllers were looking for?
[02:26:19.011 --> 02:26:22.933]  Oh, wait a second.
[02:26:22.933 --> 02:26:24.634]  This is from that day.
[02:26:24.634 --> 02:26:30.357]  People have videos, and I know your people will jump all over it trying to research it.
[02:26:30.357 --> 02:26:32.278]  There was some people coming over to me and saying,
[02:26:33.291 --> 02:26:39.096]  There were three cops, at least three, saying that they were being funded.
[02:26:39.096 --> 02:26:40.737]  This is Metro Police.
[02:26:40.737 --> 02:26:48.523]  I don't know if this is absolute crap, but the thing was, I was listening to the people who just came from listening to them say it.
[02:26:48.523 --> 02:26:51.546]  Three cops actually admitted that IMF was funding
[02:26:55.683 --> 02:27:09.767]  Oh yeah, I had my reporters arrested at the G20 for just filming in a park and it was paid for and run by G20 security for the G20.
[02:27:09.767 --> 02:27:16.989]  You're saying the IMF, we've got to look into this, that's big, was actually, well that's who runs the whole thing, that's who's taking us over is foreign banks.
[02:27:18.502 --> 02:27:20.304]  I figured you'd like chewing on that.
[02:27:20.304 --> 02:27:22.966]  I'd love to hear the results and what turns up
[02:27:35.638 --> 02:27:38.901]  Veteran Navy SEAL joins us, Benjamin Smith right now.
[02:27:38.901 --> 02:27:42.784]  This article is put on Fox News 2, Washington Times.
[02:27:42.784 --> 02:27:48.349]  Family suspects SEAL Team 6 crash was inside job on worst day in Afghanistan.
[02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:57.677]  I was told that by a Navy SEAL in SEAL Team 3, not in SEAL Team 6, who had a friend in SEAL Team 6, weeks after the crash, and I'm on record the first person to ever say it.
[02:27:57.677 --> 02:28:00.380]  I know that's hard to talk about, but do you have anything to say on that subject?
[02:28:02.163 --> 02:28:02.964]  Not at this time.
[02:28:02.964 --> 02:28:16.391]  I mean, you know, how the memorial and stuff went down in Afghanistan with an imam praying over our dead seals is my main issue with that.
[02:28:16.391 --> 02:28:19.813]  But, you know, past that, I'm not going to touch that.
[02:28:19.813 --> 02:28:22.195]  Sure.
[02:28:22.195 --> 02:28:25.716]  Any other points you think are important to make about the state of where this country is right now?
[02:28:25.716 --> 02:28:29.058]  Yeah.
[02:28:30.606 --> 02:28:33.147]  It lies within ourselves.
[02:28:33.147 --> 02:28:47.033]  It's the possibility of our government not being on our side, ideologically stating so, in, you know, if the president says, you judge me by who I put around me, uh, okay, look at that.
[02:28:47.033 --> 02:28:48.253]  Now look at us.
[02:28:48.253 --> 02:28:51.595]  Are they what we believe or not?
[02:28:51.595 --> 02:28:57.297]  So, you know, you have to have that conversation, start talking to people you don't know or people who
[02:28:58.095 --> 02:29:00.776]  Disagree with you and try to have the logical conversation.
[02:29:00.776 --> 02:29:19.883]  They will eventually start to see that you're intelligent and you're not a kook just do your research and sound be Just in a conversation not to be angry I Agree, what are you doing in your life right now?
[02:29:19.883 --> 02:29:22.644]  Well, it's you said I've been over a
[02:29:24.859 --> 02:29:26.901]  No, I haven't been over there since 06.
[02:29:26.901 --> 02:29:30.724]  I believe in what America is and I've given everything I have.
[02:29:42.324 --> 02:29:43.806]  Hold on, Benjamin.
[02:29:43.806 --> 02:29:46.851]  Let's see if you can do five more minutes.
[02:29:46.851 --> 02:29:50.256]  I want you to be able to finish your point.
[02:29:50.256 --> 02:29:51.638]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.638 --> 02:29:53.220]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:56.845]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.368 --> 02:30:06.830]  Alex Jones here, and I want to tell you about a longtime friend of the show, My Patriot Supply.
[02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:15.712]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[02:30:15.712 --> 02:30:23.535]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow Patriots.
[02:30:23.535 --> 02:30:30.937]  My Patriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.

[02:31:58.316 --> 02:31:59.176]  Others don't.
[02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:06.092]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[02:32:06.092 --> 02:32:13.475]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[02:32:13.475 --> 02:32:16.836]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[02:32:16.836 --> 02:32:18.597]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[02:32:18.857 --> 02:32:23.520]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:26.422]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[02:32:26.422 --> 02:32:32.386]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.

[02:33:17.248 --> 02:33:22.820]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:25.506]  Alright, a few more minutes with Benjamin Smith.
[02:33:26.644 --> 02:33:35.947]  Veteran Navy SEAL and then one year of contracting until 2006 and now he's very active trying to rally Americans to realize it's not hard.
[02:33:35.947 --> 02:33:50.813]  Our Bill of Rights and Constitution is being dismantled and then the Republican leadership joined with the Democrats to go after Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and others who are pointing out that Obamacare is a total fraud and that now it doesn't work and Obama says it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[02:33:50.813 --> 02:33:54.694]  I mean you were really saying some powerful stuff during the breaks.
[02:33:56.389 --> 02:34:08.298]  So, Benjamin, I mean, tell folks, I mean, you know, lead folks, tell folks what you're trying to do, because I was asking you what do you think we should do, and you were making some really great points during the break, so finish up with some comments.
[02:34:08.298 --> 02:34:23.890]  Yeah, well, with everything that we've gained our freedom from through the Revolution back in the 1700s, it wasn't individual sovereignty, it wasn't the freedom
[02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:33.682]  Which we all talk about now that got us the freedom that we have and that we're kind of wasting away.
[02:34:33.682 --> 02:34:35.002]  It was unity.
[02:34:35.002 --> 02:34:36.242]  It was discipline.
[02:34:36.242 --> 02:34:41.784]  It was people working together and sacrificing for each other.
[02:34:41.784 --> 02:34:44.364]  It was the battlefield of ideas.
[02:34:44.364 --> 02:34:49.665]  It was, you know, that unity between you and the person next to you.
[02:34:49.665 --> 02:34:53.506]  And the thing is, they started to, as we need to do now,
[02:34:54.631 --> 02:34:56.313]  Come together in business.
[02:34:56.313 --> 02:35:06.125]  We need to start monetizing what we do, because everybody out there on, like, on the speaking circuit, or if anybody's standing, they're being attacked by IRS.
[02:35:06.756 --> 02:35:12.438]  And in the IRS, now, a lot of us are considered, I'm a propagandist.
[02:35:12.438 --> 02:35:15.600]  You know, like, if there's any communist rhetoric.
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:25.544]  But like, a lot of working together, doing things, and sacrificing for each other, and giving, and then giving again to each other, that has to start happening.
[02:35:26.687 --> 02:35:28.568]  It turns into a groundswell.
[02:35:28.568 --> 02:35:31.990]  I mean, it's not going to be as well said as I said during the break.
[02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:41.254]  But, um, to the broader picture, like when we're talking about martial law, martial law suspends the Constitution of the United States.
[02:35:41.254 --> 02:35:54.280]  What would our government want to do, and I know this goes over to a lot of your people as well, if they suspend the Constitution, martial law happens for five minutes or whatever the NDAA made martial law in Posse Comitatus.
[02:35:54.986 --> 02:36:04.237]  Would that allow, immediately, that would allow UN to come into the United States and whatever entity that doesn't like us.
[02:36:04.237 --> 02:36:05.759]  You know, it's an open door.
[02:36:05.759 --> 02:36:13.548]  Sheila Jackson Lee calls for it openly on the House floor, which is absolutely insane.
[02:36:14.608 --> 02:36:16.791]  No, these people are dangerous.
[02:36:16.791 --> 02:36:18.612]  And I agree with you.
[02:36:18.612 --> 02:36:19.874]  We're all under attack.
[02:36:19.874 --> 02:36:32.007]  I think the number one thing people have to get to their heads that are libertarian, veterans, conservatives, just people that love freedom, people that just love the American system compared to communism and fascism, people who don't want to be slaves.
[02:36:32.307 --> 02:36:38.030]  We're in a war, we're under attack, and denying it gives the enemy the total advantage.
[02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:52.679]  We have to admit we're under attack, and every man, woman, and child has to pick little goals and complete them, and just resisting this in the info war, resisting it monetarily, resisting it by supporting patriots, resisting it by saying no to tyrants.
[02:36:52.679 --> 02:36:55.020]  We will bring them down!
[02:36:55.020 --> 02:36:57.522]  It's a cold civil war is what's going on.
[02:36:57.987 --> 02:37:01.969]  You know, there's no violence yet, and it's for the direction of a country.
[02:37:01.969 --> 02:37:03.910]  We have to find what we agree upon.
[02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:11.873]  Everyone's so used to pointing at something and bitching about it, but they're not, they don't know to go to it.
[02:37:11.873 --> 02:37:20.216]  You run to the sound of those shots being fired, and you do right, you do good, to the end of your being, you do what is right.
[02:37:20.216 --> 02:37:26.239]  You know, find what you agree with somebody on, not emphasize what you don't.
[02:37:26.806 --> 02:37:27.386]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:37:27.386 --> 02:37:29.147]  Because everybody's fallible.
[02:37:29.147 --> 02:37:31.108]  Everybody's got things wrong with them.
[02:37:31.108 --> 02:37:34.530]  Find what binds you together, not what separates you.
[02:37:34.530 --> 02:37:35.091]  I agree.
[02:37:35.091 --> 02:37:41.915]  I mean, I really, after 18 years on air and 20 years fighting for liberty, in just the last year, people that have attacked me, done wrong to me,
[02:37:43.236 --> 02:37:43.977]  It doesn't matter.
[02:37:43.977 --> 02:37:52.729]  I've just forgiven them and ignored it and not spent time, you know, trying to hurt them or anything because I realize unity is the key.
[02:37:52.729 --> 02:37:54.652]  The globalists are coming down on us.
[02:37:54.652 --> 02:37:59.959]  We've got to get together and focus on that issue.
[02:37:59.959 --> 02:38:00.119]  Yeah.
[02:38:01.716 --> 02:38:02.717]  Oh man.
[02:38:02.717 --> 02:38:07.799]  But continuing, I mean other points, other points, because let me ask you this question.
[02:38:07.799 --> 02:38:24.667]  I am striving to get people awake so that the global crime syndicate, the operatives, they can look at things and tell they're not going to win if they launch a false flag and try to blame us or provocateur something or bring in Al Qaeda people they're protecting and whatever happens to try to distract us.
[02:38:25.487 --> 02:38:29.349]  But what happens if they do start trying to take guns?
[02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:36.393]  What do we do if they do start, you know, not just audit people that are in the Tea Party or audit veterans that speak out and persecute us.
[02:38:36.393 --> 02:38:40.035]  What if they start trying to round people up and say we're terrorists?
[02:38:40.035 --> 02:38:43.717]  What happens at that point?
[02:38:43.717 --> 02:38:53.202]  Well, um, it's, this is, this is like one of my other things, like in conversation, look at the Second Amendment.
[02:38:53.917 --> 02:38:58.699]  It says a well-regulated militia, and that doesn't mean controlled by government.
[02:38:58.699 --> 02:39:00.419]  That just means well-trained.
[02:39:00.419 --> 02:39:04.100]  That means, you know, they could shoot, move, and communicate together.
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:20.066]  And, you know, in working together with other citizens who believe the same thing, a militia is just the last bastion of what an American has, you know, as per the Bill of Rights.
[02:39:20.066 --> 02:39:22.827]  You know, you guys at least get to join together and
[02:39:24.471 --> 02:39:34.976]  Well, the good news is, and just to quantify it, and then we're going to let you go because I know you've got a meeting you've got to go to here.
[02:39:53.126 --> 02:39:54.086]  What about the numbers?
[02:39:54.086 --> 02:40:01.588]  I mean, you were telling me off-air that, yeah, even the political speakers there were talking about how they want to cause a crisis and get veterans to do something violent.
[02:40:01.588 --> 02:40:10.051]  When you're talking to, you know, folks that are currently still in the special warfare community, you were saying that they're being brought in and given the litmus test.
[02:40:10.051 --> 02:40:11.571]  We've confirmed this is going on.
[02:40:11.571 --> 02:40:12.771]  Will you take the guns?
[02:40:12.771 --> 02:40:18.033]  But what about just general folks that are recently out, like yourself, in the last five, six, seven years?
[02:40:18.633 --> 02:40:31.498]  My number is over 70% now understand just how much trouble we're in but it is hard to believe this is really happening but it's happened everywhere else why are we surprised so what's the number I mean is there a huge awakening you're saying?
[02:40:31.498 --> 02:40:44.604]  I think there's a lot of there's a lot of people waking up there's a lot of fear and the fear either people can wake up
[02:40:45.555 --> 02:40:51.620]  Or they're gonna do something stupid, kind of like, you know, the one that flies off the handle, the knee-jerk reaction.
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:52.680]  That's what they're looking for.
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:58.305]  Because, you know, the free market has basically been destroyed.
[02:40:58.305 --> 02:40:59.245]  Look at healthcare.
[02:40:59.245 --> 02:41:02.288]  That's the government owning close to 20% of it.
[02:41:02.288 --> 02:41:04.329]  And they're rushing it.
[02:41:04.329 --> 02:41:05.770]  And it's meant to fail.
[02:41:05.770 --> 02:41:08.352]  It's meant to fail.
[02:41:08.352 --> 02:41:13.216]  And the thing is, it kills our economy if we just let it, people say, stand on its own merit.
[02:41:13.846 --> 02:41:24.652]  That's 20% of our economy which is operating at a absolute subpar performance with how much debt we have and our credit levels are going low.
[02:41:24.652 --> 02:41:27.174]  It's just, it's like, this is not going to work.
[02:41:27.174 --> 02:41:29.035]  The people who wrote it said it's not going to work.
[02:41:29.035 --> 02:41:30.736]  It's systematic sabotage.
[02:41:30.736 --> 02:41:32.557]  Admit we're under economic attack.
[02:41:32.557 --> 02:41:33.638]  We're under attack.
[02:41:33.638 --> 02:41:35.519]  This is a globalist war.
[02:41:35.519 --> 02:41:36.479]  Period.
[02:41:36.479 --> 02:41:37.100]  Yes.
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:37.880]  Yes.
[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:40.062]  Look at how we got Russia.
[02:41:40.062 --> 02:41:42.163]  Shut down their economy?
[02:41:42.163 --> 02:41:42.303]  Yes.
[02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:44.010]  Exactly.
[02:41:44.010 --> 02:41:47.833]  Do you think we actually won the Cold War?
[02:41:47.833 --> 02:41:50.415]  Give us your take on that.
[02:41:50.415 --> 02:41:51.495]  Oh, okay.
[02:41:51.495 --> 02:42:00.841]  Um, well, look, the Cold War, you've got a socialist and self-without communist and all them around him in the White House.
[02:42:00.841 --> 02:42:12.289]  It's, you know, if you're, if you're playing chess, that's the king, the head of our country is of the political bend of
[02:42:13.371 --> 02:42:15.252]  Our adversaries in the Cold War.
[02:42:15.252 --> 02:42:20.635]  That, to me, says a lot of things that aren't... that don't say we won.
[02:42:20.635 --> 02:42:20.975]  That's right.
[02:42:20.975 --> 02:42:24.297]  They've captured most of the federal government, but they haven't captured the military.
[02:42:24.297 --> 02:42:25.178]  The military's waking up.
[02:42:25.178 --> 02:42:27.219]  They're trying to capture the states.
[02:42:27.219 --> 02:42:35.624]  I think we just politically call them out and get really aggressive, and I think that is what will basically sap them of any moral authority.
[02:42:35.624 --> 02:42:38.906]  They want Cloward and Piven to bankrupt us, to blow out our engine.
[02:42:38.906 --> 02:42:42.268]  What do we do, then, to get it going when they control the economy?
[02:42:43.905 --> 02:42:47.486]  Yeah, and there's a bunch of other stuff.
[02:42:47.486 --> 02:42:56.549]  I mean, I gotta get running, but talking about the Cloward and Piven, and from Clinton to Obama, that's an interesting jump.
[02:42:56.549 --> 02:42:58.490]  You know, we can talk about that some other time.
[02:42:58.490 --> 02:43:10.853]  Sure, folks can go to benjaminsmith.us.com and find out about your upcoming speaking engagements, or how do folks get you to come out and speak to their group?
[02:43:10.853 --> 02:43:11.634]  Yeah, go there.
[02:43:13.527 --> 02:43:19.049]  And we'll have it up there on how to get in touch and whatever we're doing.
[02:43:19.049 --> 02:43:20.210]  All right, well, great job.
[02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:29.493]  And again, you're not going to save the world, I'm not going to save the world, but all of us together recognizing this, taking action, working together, unity around liberty, we're going to win.
[02:43:29.493 --> 02:43:31.314]  Amazing interview, Benjamin Smith.
[02:43:31.314 --> 02:43:42.058]  Thank you for your courage, after all your service, to come back in the middle of the republic in its greatest threat in history and to be standing against the threats and the audits and the authoritarianism of these communists.
[02:43:42.498 --> 02:43:43.199]  God bless you, sir.
[02:43:43.199 --> 02:43:44.419]  It was great having you on.
[02:43:44.419 --> 02:43:45.100]  Yep.
[02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:45.660]  Keep going on.
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:46.521]  Sign your oath.
[02:43:46.521 --> 02:43:47.221]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:47.221 --> 02:43:47.962]  Thank you very much.
[02:43:47.962 --> 02:43:49.643]  All right, there you go.
[02:43:49.643 --> 02:43:53.306]  Tell him thank you, guys, because we're in the middle of a segment here.
[02:43:53.306 --> 02:43:54.026]  There goes our guest.
[02:43:54.026 --> 02:43:56.308]  We're going to get him back on in the near future via Skype.
[02:43:56.308 --> 02:43:57.589]  You can hear him there, I think, in a car.
[02:43:57.589 --> 02:43:58.890]  I'm going to go into another meeting.
[02:43:58.890 --> 02:44:01.712]  You can hear it dinging in the background when somebody got out of the car.
[02:44:01.712 --> 02:44:06.815]  But he's there fighting, and I'm fighting, and I'm learning how to fight these people as I go.
[02:44:06.815 --> 02:44:08.737]  I always use the truth.
[02:44:09.617 --> 02:44:13.942]  But you don't know how to present the truth, or what angle to hit at.
[02:44:13.942 --> 02:44:24.573]  And I'm just a work-in-progress, 20 years fighting for basic American principles, basic common law principles, 18 years on air, and I have wrecked
[02:44:25.314 --> 02:44:29.337]  So many globalist operations with my listeners and I'm just one guy.
[02:44:29.337 --> 02:44:40.006]  There are so many people out there that are better looking than I am, smarter than I am, tougher than I am, more motivated than I am, with less problems than I have.
[02:44:40.946 --> 02:44:47.010]  I probably got too much of a temper a lot of the time, too much energy sometimes, but at least I'm trying as hard as I can.
[02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:49.031]  And I'm telling you, you need to stop.
[02:44:49.031 --> 02:45:00.739]  Every time I talk to one of these Navy SEALs or some Delta Force person or some FBI guy, they're always almost, they're good guys, so humble they don't even see themselves as leaders.
[02:45:00.739 --> 02:45:03.581]  And so they're just humbly trying to do little things here and there.
[02:45:03.581 --> 02:45:08.624]  And that's all good, but before this turns into a shooting war, folks, we've got to shake
[02:45:09.673 --> 02:45:12.115]  People out of their doldrums.
[02:45:12.115 --> 02:45:16.780]  We've got to get them out of their trance and get really, really aggressive.
[02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:18.501]  And he's absolutely right.
[02:45:18.501 --> 02:45:32.314]  A lot of people hear this information, either get really scared or they want to go out and get aggressive overnight and have some physical fight with some compartmentalized threat fusion center, you know, down the road where the people don't even know what's going on half the time.
[02:45:33.900 --> 02:45:40.824]  Or, because Army PSYOPS is being used domestically against us, people think, well, I'll just go, you know, after an Army PSYOPS group.
[02:45:40.824 --> 02:45:44.426]  Those people are probably our biggest group of listeners, because they're sitting in the middle of it.
[02:45:44.426 --> 02:45:46.327]  They know they're compartmentalized.
[02:45:46.327 --> 02:45:48.328]  They know their mission's unconstitutional.
[02:45:48.328 --> 02:45:51.310]  They know that the globalists have captured the White House.
[02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:53.851]  They know that we're into this situation.
[02:45:53.851 --> 02:45:57.093]  They know that we're in deep trouble.
[02:45:57.093 --> 02:45:59.134]  And so they're all sitting around going, what do we do?
[02:45:59.134 --> 02:46:00.115]  Well, I'll tell you what you do.
[02:46:01.400 --> 02:46:10.689]  And if it's printing up bumper stickers for a website you put up that's got just 10 facts about the New World Order and then 10 ways to fight back, and then you stick those up in your area.
[02:46:10.689 --> 02:46:16.335]  Or you start a little newsletter that's one sheet once a week that you out at 4am go and stick in everybody's mailbox.
[02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:18.841]  That'll do something.
[02:46:18.841 --> 02:46:20.422]  Or you go do an Axis TV show.
[02:46:20.422 --> 02:46:22.342]  Or you start calling in to talk radio.
[02:46:22.342 --> 02:46:24.403]  Or you go out and stay on the street with a sign.
[02:46:24.403 --> 02:46:26.724]  Or you start your own blog radio show online.
[02:46:26.724 --> 02:46:28.084]  Or do your own YouTube channel.
[02:46:28.084 --> 02:46:33.946]  Or go to public events and grab the politician by the arm and say, we don't like the New World Order takeover.
[02:46:33.946 --> 02:46:34.946]  We know what's going on.
[02:46:34.946 --> 02:46:36.427]  We know America's been captured.
[02:46:36.427 --> 02:46:39.427]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, groups like that.
[02:46:39.427 --> 02:46:42.188]  They have been caught funding the anti-gun groups.
[02:46:42.188 --> 02:46:43.729]  Funding the Agenda 21.
[02:46:43.729 --> 02:46:45.089]  We've done reports on it.
[02:46:45.089 --> 02:46:47.130]  Point that out!
[02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:47.450]  That, hey!
[02:46:48.761 --> 02:46:55.547]  This is a big deal that we've got some of these big banks and groups, and I'm not even centered by that works with those banks, or terrorist, or evil, or bad.
[02:46:55.547 --> 02:46:57.669]  I mean, those are the biggest things in the economy.
[02:46:57.669 --> 02:46:59.251]  It's the people running them.
[02:46:59.251 --> 02:47:05.036]  We have to call out the... They tried to put Larry Summers in as the head of the Federal Reserve when he engineered the current system we're in.
[02:47:06.596 --> 02:47:11.058]  That's literally like trying to have Satan, you know, oversee his trial before God.
[02:47:11.058 --> 02:47:17.940]  I mean, it's like having Hitler at the Nuremberg trial as the judge, as the chief justice.
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:23.903]  We have to see that we're being overwhelmed by tyranny right now and recognize it and get past the fear.
[02:47:23.903 --> 02:47:26.343]  And they want you to know that they'll try to audit you.
[02:47:26.343 --> 02:47:30.065]  They'll want you to know that, oh, you'll be put on a list.
[02:47:30.065 --> 02:47:31.145]  You're already on a list.
[02:47:31.145 --> 02:47:32.806]  They're already shutting the country down.
[02:47:34.042 --> 02:47:39.785]  We have no chance here, ladies and gentlemen, if we don't stand up and get involved now.
[02:47:39.785 --> 02:47:41.787]  We have absolutely no future.
[02:47:41.787 --> 02:47:44.668]  They want to break us fully.
[02:47:44.668 --> 02:47:55.275]  And it is going to take people like Benjamin Smith, who is getting active and getting aggressive and going out and speaking out, and all of you have to be leaders.
[02:47:57.093 --> 02:47:58.494]  And I agree with what he's saying.
[02:47:58.494 --> 02:48:09.722]  People that are veterans especially, and who aren't cowards, and who understand we're in a military attack here, we are under an economic, and now political, and soon physical attack.
[02:48:09.722 --> 02:48:17.928]  And that's why I want to like the police, I want them to be honorable, but they're in a command structure, more and more, that is authoritarian.
[02:48:17.928 --> 02:48:19.649]  And authoritarianism is not liberty.
[02:48:20.731 --> 02:48:22.332]  Tyranny is not liberty.
[02:48:22.332 --> 02:48:23.894]  Oppression is not liberty.
[02:48:23.894 --> 02:48:28.658]  The globalists have done all these horrible things worldwide in our name through all these different psy-op frauds.
[02:48:28.658 --> 02:48:30.980]  Now they're going to do it here.
[02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:32.841]  And they are not going to stop, folks.
[02:48:32.841 --> 02:48:37.626]  They're going to carry out a Soviet-style Sovietization like they did in Eastern Europe.
[02:48:37.626 --> 02:48:38.726]  Guaranteed!
[02:48:38.726 --> 02:48:40.208]  Guaranteed!
[02:48:40.208 --> 02:48:46.633]  I mean, I'm up here risking my life, folks, because I'm not going to run to some other country where they're putting the same thing in there.
[02:48:46.633 --> 02:48:47.274]  I can't run.
[02:48:49.002 --> 02:48:54.348]  And that's why so many times people talk to me, they go, man, you're scaring people, you're helping the enemy.
[02:48:54.348 --> 02:48:57.732]  And I don't really think that's true.
[02:48:57.732 --> 02:48:59.154]  I really don't think that's true.
[02:48:59.154 --> 02:49:01.937]  I mean, if that's true, then I'm really a fool.
[02:49:01.937 --> 02:49:04.821]  And I'm not, I don't think I'm a fool.
[02:49:04.821 --> 02:49:08.886]  I think, I want to be told there's a robber trying to break in my garage by the neighbor calling me.
[02:49:09.454 --> 02:49:11.756]  I don't want the neighbor to go, oh, that was kind of scary, I didn't call you.
[02:49:11.756 --> 02:49:13.117]  Let the guy home invade my house.
[02:49:13.117 --> 02:49:15.979]  I mean, the person's already trying to break in my house.
[02:49:15.979 --> 02:49:16.700]  I want to know.
[02:49:16.700 --> 02:49:21.123]  I don't want to hide under the bed and just imagine that it's not going on.
[02:49:21.123 --> 02:49:24.206]  So I see people, yeah, they get scared hearing all this.
[02:49:24.206 --> 02:49:27.729]  You should be scared of not getting aggressive and active.
[02:49:27.729 --> 02:49:30.611]  You should be scared that you're not involved.
[02:49:30.611 --> 02:49:35.315]  You should be scared because you're just giving these people free reign.
[02:49:35.315 --> 02:49:38.978]  And so don't go off half-cocked and go shoot up a threat fusion center.
[02:49:40.888 --> 02:49:49.911]  Don't go off half-cocked and you get pulled over even if the cop's being arrogant and aggressive and out of control and wants to search you illegally and wrongfully and shoot him!
[02:49:51.192 --> 02:49:53.514]  What you do is you try to talk to them, educate them.
[02:49:53.514 --> 02:49:54.495]  They do you wrong.
[02:49:54.495 --> 02:49:55.996]  You personally sue them.
[02:49:55.996 --> 02:49:58.017]  You petition the courts.
[02:49:58.017 --> 02:49:59.398]  You do shows about them.
[02:49:59.398 --> 02:50:01.060]  You start filming the police.
[02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:02.441]  Showing them they're wrong.
[02:50:02.441 --> 02:50:03.882]  Pushing them that way.
[02:50:03.882 --> 02:50:07.785]  As far as you can until they try to come arrest leaders of the Liberty Movement.
[02:50:07.785 --> 02:50:08.766]  Then you know, folks.
[02:50:08.766 --> 02:50:10.247]  Then you know they're coming.
[02:50:10.247 --> 02:50:12.168]  There won't be communications at that time.
[02:50:12.168 --> 02:50:12.549]  You'll know.
[02:50:13.399 --> 02:50:18.643]  And then it's your job not to just sit in your house and wait for folks to come drag you out of it as Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
[02:50:18.643 --> 02:50:24.487]  So we're doing everything we can as the biggest favor ever to the police and military that are currently serving.
[02:50:24.487 --> 02:50:28.931]  And the biggest favor to ourselves and everybody else here to just not do this.
[02:50:28.931 --> 02:50:30.652]  Because this is real, folks, okay?
[02:50:30.652 --> 02:50:32.654]  Just admit I was right about it all.
[02:50:32.654 --> 02:50:34.615]  Just admit all our experts were right.
[02:50:34.615 --> 02:50:35.456]  Admit we're in trouble.
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:38.941]  Okay, well we gotta get out of this.
[02:50:38.941 --> 02:50:42.882]  The solution begins the minute people admit we're in deep trouble.
[02:50:42.882 --> 02:50:47.664]  We're gonna come back with some final calls here and some other news, but stay with us.
[02:50:47.664 --> 02:50:49.205]  You're living history right now.
[02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:54.847]  And there is a foreign banking takeover that wants communism for us and they're tax-exempt offshore.
[02:50:54.847 --> 02:50:57.968]  They are trying to totally destroy the country.
[02:50:57.968 --> 02:50:59.369]  There's no doubt now.
[02:50:59.369 --> 02:50:59.489]  It's 100%.

[02:53:00.501 --> 02:53:03.262]  An e-cig revolution is sweeping across the country.

[02:53:44.309 --> 02:53:44.849]  We're good to go.
[02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:22.546]  The sociologists, the anthropologists, the psych warfare people, the collectivists are really eugenicists.
[02:54:22.546 --> 02:54:24.988]  They're not even liberals that think communism is going to help people.
[02:54:24.988 --> 02:54:26.830]  They're anti-human exterminists.
[02:54:26.830 --> 02:54:30.273]  They're on record.
[02:54:30.273 --> 02:54:31.614]  And they think we're done.
[02:54:31.614 --> 02:54:32.896]  They think they can beat us.
[02:54:32.896 --> 02:54:34.958]  That's why they fund the radical Islamic groups.
[02:54:34.958 --> 02:54:35.858]  They fund Al-Qaeda.
[02:54:37.162 --> 02:54:56.834]  On record, it's why they stage a lot of the terror attacks and provocateur the others, so they could radically transform our society and have the military and police trained for open war with the American people and build secret police, spy command centers tied into everything to federalize everything, which is really under globalist control.
[02:54:56.834 --> 02:54:59.236]  The good news is we learned about this a long time ago.
[02:55:00.293 --> 02:55:10.277]  Because military sources, law enforcement sources, had nobody to go to, except Soldier of Fortune would write about it 18 years ago, and I would cover it.
[02:55:10.277 --> 02:55:16.719]  Alex Jones, and things like Soldier of Fortune, and people like Mark Kornke, that's about it.
[02:55:16.719 --> 02:55:19.280]  And then we were the people, oh, they're the crazies!
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:22.001]  They say all this is going on, now it's all confirmed.
[02:55:23.735 --> 02:55:25.156]  And I didn't know any of this stuff.
[02:55:25.156 --> 02:55:36.322]  I was told by police chiefs and emergency managers and Navy SEALs and retired Delta Force people, hey sonny, you look like you're willing to do this, go look into this.
[02:55:36.322 --> 02:55:41.004]  Because I was just crazy enough to go do it.
[02:55:41.004 --> 02:55:47.127]  Some of the stuff, man, where they took our footage a couple times, that would be some of the most amazing footage ever if they hadn't took it.
[02:55:47.127 --> 02:55:48.268]  The point is, is that
[02:55:50.313 --> 02:55:52.434]  I was thinking about some of the stuff I've even told people about.
[02:56:20.853 --> 02:56:26.476]  I'm going to do a little bit of overdrive to go to David and James and Antonio and Julian and others.
[02:56:26.476 --> 02:56:29.477]  There's some big breaking news on Infowars.com.
[02:56:29.477 --> 02:56:34.799]  It's really bizarre that the head of Interpol says armed citizens worldwide to prevent terror attacks.
[02:56:34.799 --> 02:56:35.920]  I mean, that's just common sense.
[02:56:37.566 --> 02:56:46.632]  Boy, this guy's really, doesn't fit into the, that article's up on Infowars.com, that doesn't really fit into the establishment idiocy.
[02:56:46.632 --> 02:56:48.053]  So, wow.
[02:56:48.053 --> 02:56:52.096]  Wouldn't it just be nice to have good leaders again who aren't total criminals?
[02:56:52.096 --> 02:57:04.384]  So our economy's about building good things and having good culture instead of just corruption and government drug dealing and money laundering and evil and disarmed mega cities with poor pathetic slaves walking around getting their welfare checks.
[02:57:06.149 --> 02:57:10.671]  And Dumbo's collapsing at the free healthcare rally with Obama that's not free healthcare.
[02:57:10.671 --> 02:57:16.994]  We're going to go to break, come back and jam in a few final calls for folks like David, who's been holding the next longest, Sam.
[02:57:18.331 --> 02:57:23.073]  And Antonio, who knows, I might do 20 minutes of overdrive to get to everybody.
[02:57:23.073 --> 02:57:27.875]  But there's a lot of other news that's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:57:27.875 --> 02:57:33.718]  But the Democrats are now coming out and saying they're proud to not get any health care under the health care failure.
[02:57:33.718 --> 02:57:36.539]  That's how they show their solidarity.
[02:57:36.539 --> 02:57:38.580]  I told you they do that.
[02:57:38.580 --> 02:57:44.483]  France is demanding answers on the high-profile people and politicians being targeted by the NSA.
[02:57:44.483 --> 02:57:47.504]  Of course the NSA targets high-profile people.
[02:57:48.803 --> 02:57:56.645]  I mean it's been going on for 50 years and now they get all our data and it's totally illegal and it's not meant to keep us safe.
[02:57:56.645 --> 02:57:58.826]  It's meant to keep the criminals in charge.
[02:57:58.826 --> 02:58:04.267]  Mexico calls NSA spying on former president unacceptable.
[02:58:04.267 --> 02:58:06.267]  Greenwald promises more bombshells.
[02:58:06.267 --> 02:58:07.988]  That's up on DrugsReport.com.
[02:58:10.663 --> 02:58:18.212]  And IRS spent $132 billion on bogus tax credits to all their little buddies and friends, mainly illegal aliens.
[02:58:18.212 --> 02:58:20.174]  Just a total gang rape.
[02:58:20.174 --> 02:58:27.702]  And then here it is, Homeland spends $80 million on armed guards for civil disturbances in New York alone!
[02:58:29.056 --> 02:58:33.758]  They're getting ready for civil disturbances and financial collapse.
[02:58:33.758 --> 02:58:35.199]  They should know!
[02:58:35.199 --> 02:58:39.381]  They're steering us right into the iceberg on purpose!
[02:58:39.381 --> 02:58:39.921]  Stay with us.
[02:58:39.921 --> 02:58:42.222]  Overdrive at Infowars.com.

[03:00:24.298 --> 03:00:25.899]  I'll get to that kind of the next segment.
[03:00:25.899 --> 03:00:26.799]  We're in overdrive.
[03:00:26.799 --> 03:00:27.539]  We're live.
[03:00:27.539 --> 03:00:29.039]  Thank you for holding.
[03:00:29.039 --> 03:00:31.080]  David in California, you're on the air.
[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:31.420]  Welcome.
[03:00:33.362 --> 03:00:34.303]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:34.303 --> 03:00:36.905]  I've been wondering about a possible big solution.
[03:00:36.905 --> 03:00:48.695]  I've been wondering if it's possible to make a mailing list to the top, say, 100,000 influential people in the country, fundraise a few hundred thousand and then mail them your upcoming DVD, The Obama Deception.
[03:00:48.695 --> 03:00:55.020]  I've seen this kind of thing work in campaigns and other non-profit organizations, so I was just wondering if that's possible.
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:55.540]  No, you're right.
[03:00:55.540 --> 03:00:58.303]  I just don't know if I personally have the organizational skills.
[03:00:58.303 --> 03:00:59.244]  I could probably partner
[03:01:00.348 --> 03:01:04.070]  Uh, with the folks that put out Dreams of My Real Father, I know they did something similar.
[03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:10.914]  Uh, usually it's like films about being scared of Muslims, but then they don't tell you that the government actually runs the radical Muslims.
[03:01:10.914 --> 03:01:13.036]  But I know that's been done a lot.
[03:01:13.036 --> 03:01:22.681]  And then I would like to hit the 100,000 influential authoritarian liberals, because not all of them are consciously authoritarians, and hit the so-called conservatives.
[03:01:22.681 --> 03:01:25.343]  Because, you know, we're always like hitting conservatives to wake them up.
[03:01:28.234 --> 03:01:32.056]  But once a Republican gets in, they'll put up with the very same tyranny.
[03:01:32.056 --> 03:01:35.438]  I gotta say, though, with Obama, I'm even amazed how bad it is.
[03:01:35.438 --> 03:01:38.920]  I mean, I'm surprised he's gotten away with this much.
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:41.821]  But I guess they've got NSA blackmail is the intel we've got.
[03:01:41.821 --> 03:01:42.742]  But that's a great idea.
[03:01:42.742 --> 03:01:48.125]  Well, if you ever need any help running that campaign, I've done these before for other groups.
[03:01:48.125 --> 03:01:49.906]  You can have me do it part-time here remote.
[03:01:51.514 --> 03:01:59.016]  Sir, give us your name and number and we'll try to give you Rob Dues private email and send that.
[03:01:59.016 --> 03:02:02.077]  Yes, that's what I need is help, expertise.
[03:02:02.077 --> 03:02:06.599]  Because I'm busy trying to cover the news and research that and then I've got to run everything else.
[03:02:06.599 --> 03:02:12.381]  In fact, I'm not doing a money bomb this year because we've been able to raise enough money with high quality products.
[03:02:13.221 --> 03:02:17.144]  To be able to pay for the rollout and the expansion and the TV stuff, at least for now.
[03:02:17.144 --> 03:02:18.365]  We're doing a little bit better than we were.
[03:02:18.365 --> 03:02:30.375]  We've been cash-strapped the last year, but we've done some other things, brought in some new products that have helped us out, like the dash cams and the great nascent iodine and the ProPure water filters and sponsorship and stuff.
[03:02:30.375 --> 03:02:34.118]  But yes, I gave $100,000 to the winner of the films exposing the tyranny.
[03:02:38.741 --> 03:02:39.082]  I don't think so.
[03:02:52.824 --> 03:02:53.885]  How many thousands?
[03:02:53.885 --> 03:02:58.467]  There'll be like 3,000 copies or so to send those to Congress.
[03:02:58.467 --> 03:03:02.449]  And then maybe send some to all the members of all the state houses.
[03:03:02.449 --> 03:03:04.330]  And that does have a big effect.
[03:03:04.330 --> 03:03:05.671]  And then say, send it.
[03:03:05.671 --> 03:03:06.991]  That's a great idea.
[03:03:06.991 --> 03:03:09.633]  How much will we need to raise to do that?
[03:03:09.633 --> 03:03:18.417]  I think to send out about 100,000 DVDs at cost with all the shipping, everything, I'd probably have to raise... I'd probably have to raise, what, $500,000?
[03:03:18.417 --> 03:03:19.137]  How would that work?
[03:03:21.621 --> 03:03:28.324]  Well, if you can get those out at wholesale cost, then you can probably do it for one or two dollars per shipping.
[03:03:28.324 --> 03:03:30.105]  Really?
[03:03:30.105 --> 03:03:32.085]  And I've done these on a big scale.
[03:03:32.085 --> 03:03:33.586]  I have a lot of experience on this.
[03:03:33.586 --> 03:03:35.387]  I'd be more than happy to help you out on it.
[03:03:35.387 --> 03:03:37.928]  I've worked with one group that had devastating results.
[03:03:37.928 --> 03:03:38.908]  It's very effective.
[03:03:38.908 --> 03:03:41.189]  You also want to get it out to police chiefs.
[03:03:41.189 --> 03:03:42.710]  You want to get it out to educators.
[03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:44.771]  You want to get it out to colleges and universities.
[03:03:45.311 --> 03:03:47.912]  You want to get it out, maybe possibly even hospitals.
[03:03:47.912 --> 03:03:49.852]  Well, how do you do it that inexpensive?
[03:03:49.852 --> 03:03:53.293]  I mean, if I print 20,000 DVDs, they're like 70 cents a piece.
[03:03:53.293 --> 03:03:58.193]  I mean, so like the DVD, the packaging, you really think you can mail it out for $2 a piece?
[03:03:58.193 --> 03:04:00.654]  Wow, that's awesome!
[03:04:00.654 --> 03:04:02.554]  So we could fund that with $150,000 then?
[03:04:02.554 --> 03:04:11.956]  Yeah, I've seen, well the group I work with actually purchased their own manufacturing equipment, so they had really low rates on their manufacturing costs.
[03:04:12.822 --> 03:04:14.825]  And it was an amazing campaign.
[03:04:14.825 --> 03:04:16.487]  I'd be happy to run this off for you.
[03:04:16.487 --> 03:04:22.454]  I'll tell you what, sir, send us your bio that you've run these campaigns and we'll try to work it out and hire you.
[03:04:22.454 --> 03:04:22.935]  Absolutely.
[03:04:22.935 --> 03:04:28.141]  I've thought about that for a decade and has never had the money or the... I'm too busy trying to make the film.
[03:04:28.141 --> 03:04:29.362]  But yes, that's what I want.
[03:04:30.023 --> 03:04:38.769]  Because instead of just putting it on YouTube and 20 million people see it and, you know, maybe 50,000 of our listeners buy a DVD, it pays for the film, which is great, and then they make copies, give it to people.
[03:04:38.769 --> 03:04:41.852]  We always have the copy thing where people can make copies.
[03:04:41.852 --> 03:04:42.852]  That is a great idea.
[03:04:42.852 --> 03:04:44.213]  I want to do it.
[03:04:44.213 --> 03:04:46.675]  What's your... You want to be public, David?
[03:04:46.675 --> 03:04:48.477]  What's your full name?
[03:04:48.477 --> 03:04:49.177]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:04:49.177 --> 03:04:50.018]  David Potter.
[03:04:50.799 --> 03:05:01.205]  All right, David, we're going to give us your info, your name and number, and I'll give you the private email during the break, and we'll put you up on the big board to make sure that happens.
[03:05:01.205 --> 03:05:06.948]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[03:05:06.948 --> 03:05:14.332]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[03:05:14.332 --> 03:05:17.494]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[03:05:17.654 --> 03:05:19.675]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:24.336]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[03:05:24.336 --> 03:05:27.237]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[03:05:27.237 --> 03:05:33.199]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[03:05:33.199 --> 03:05:36.880]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:42.121]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine.
[03:05:42.121 --> 03:05:45.102]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:45.302 --> 03:05:51.287]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[03:06:02.213 --> 03:06:03.634]  This alert just came in.
[03:06:03.634 --> 03:06:11.018]  This special announcement is for business owners and leaders of organizations who've been waiting for the right time to build.
[03:06:11.018 --> 03:06:16.901]  General Steel has made it impossible to wait any longer with rock-bottom prices that could save you thousands.
[03:06:16.901 --> 03:06:17.442]  That's right.
[03:06:17.442 --> 03:06:24.105]  General Steel, America's leader in pre-engineered structures, is offering buildings at prices you will never see again.
[03:06:24.105 --> 03:06:25.286]  Don't miss these specials.

[03:06:26.427 --> 03:06:27.507]  Or a 50 by 100 for under $30,000.
[03:06:30.649 --> 03:06:31.350]  You heard right.
[03:06:31.350 --> 03:06:34.353]  That's 5,000 square feet, under $30,000.
[03:06:34.353 --> 03:06:39.398]  Manufacturers, if you need a larger building, try a 100 x 100 commercial building for $129,000.
[03:06:39.398 --> 03:06:42.341]  You can't afford to rent with these prices.
[03:06:42.341 --> 03:06:44.923]  Imagine a 70 x 100 foot church building for under $69,000.
[03:06:46.485 --> 03:06:51.650]  With the economy improving and interest rates still at historic lows, you can't afford to wait.
[03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:52.251]  So call 866-91-STEEL.

[03:06:52.431 --> 03:06:52.732]  That's 866-917-8335.
[03:06:52.732 --> 03:06:55.254]  A healthy digestive system supports a healthy immune system.
[03:07:05.044 --> 03:07:09.248]  And a healthy immune system protects you against infections and disease.
[03:07:09.248 --> 03:07:14.633]  Pro-EM1 Daily Probiotic Cleanse, available at Terragonics.com, is the key to digestive health.
[03:07:14.633 --> 03:07:18.917]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic and is gentle enough to use every day.
[03:07:18.917 --> 03:07:30.347]  Pro-EM1 contains three groups of beneficial microbes and enzymes to cleanse and remove toxins, supports weight loss, improves absorption of food nutrients, and aids in controlling yeast and other infections.
[03:07:30.347 --> 03:07:31.128]  Pro-EM1 is

[03:07:52.815 --> 03:07:53.615]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[03:08:02.188 --> 03:08:04.409]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.409 --> 03:08:13.193]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.193 --> 03:08:15.254]  InfoWars.com is down right now.
[03:08:15.254 --> 03:08:17.395]  You don't see that too often.
[03:08:17.395 --> 03:08:20.036]  We're redesigning the sites right now so as to make them even better.
[03:08:20.036 --> 03:08:25.059]  We'll see what happens with InfoWars.com and PrisonVlada.com.
[03:08:25.059 --> 03:08:27.560]  Getting into the other news that's out.
[03:08:28.786 --> 03:08:33.390]  The New York Times is reporting on what I told you years ago the plan was, because they were public about it on C-SPAN.
[03:08:33.390 --> 03:08:37.053]  A security check now starts before you fly.
[03:08:37.053 --> 03:08:41.176]  And they're going to use anything like claiming you haven't paid the IRS to not let you fly.
[03:08:41.176 --> 03:08:42.417]  There's no judge, there's no jury.
[03:08:42.417 --> 03:08:43.618]  They'll just put you on a no-fly list.
[03:08:43.618 --> 03:08:46.841]  So this is the total authoritarian enslavement.
[03:08:46.841 --> 03:08:49.723]  And the New York Times reports on it like it's fun and safe.
[03:08:49.723 --> 03:08:57.749]  And they're going to go through a wide array of government and private databases, mainlining NSA, like car registrations and employment information.
[03:08:59.051 --> 03:09:05.576]  So there's the mission creep of the new secret police toilet attendant group that is going to rule our lives and run checkpoints.
[03:09:05.576 --> 03:09:09.359]  And if you make a joke about it, they're going to arrest you.
[03:09:09.359 --> 03:09:12.381]  So that is the word.
[03:09:12.381 --> 03:09:14.543]  Just total tyranny.
[03:09:14.543 --> 03:09:19.107]  Just bow down, get ready, and they're going to take your pension funds too, and just worship them.
[03:09:19.107 --> 03:09:20.628]  Worship them.
[03:09:20.628 --> 03:09:27.614]  Continuing here with some of the other news that is coming out, Ted Cruz
[03:09:29.205 --> 03:09:40.253]  is being attacked and the website is being run by Nigerian email scammers.
[03:09:40.253 --> 03:09:41.014]  That's right.
[03:09:41.014 --> 03:09:44.637]  And still no one is able to sign up for it.
[03:09:44.637 --> 03:09:47.459]  People that say they have, think they have.
[03:09:47.459 --> 03:09:49.140]  So they go, I signed up, I'm getting in there.
[03:09:49.140 --> 03:09:50.941]  I go, oh yes.
[03:09:50.941 --> 03:09:55.145]  So Cruz says Nigerian email scammers running Obamacare website.
[03:09:56.073 --> 03:09:58.593]  And of course he's comparing it to that, they're not actually doing it.
[03:09:58.593 --> 03:10:07.075]  The glitches, he compared it, the glitches, to the Nigerian email scammers, which people still think is real, by the way.
[03:10:07.075 --> 03:10:12.156]  I talk about that a lot because that really is what it's like.
[03:10:12.156 --> 03:10:18.157]  And by the way, if you can't even sign up on it, what happens once there's claims?
[03:10:18.157 --> 03:10:23.758]  And I gotta tell you, Dr. Blaylock, six years ago, when Obama was first elected, or about to be elected, he was president-elect,
[03:10:24.963 --> 03:10:29.446]  He said, you watch, none of it's going to work, it's designed to wreck everything.
[03:10:29.446 --> 03:10:37.211]  And my dad is, well not anymore, he's phasing it out, in fact he's 95% of it now, is a healthcare consultant.
[03:10:37.211 --> 03:10:42.275]  And he said, no, the way this is written, you cannot take Medicare and Medicaid and not break a law.
[03:10:42.275 --> 03:10:48.079]  And actually come in and tell the big providers, they go, play ball and be our friends and do what we want, and we won't indict you.
[03:10:49.437 --> 03:10:51.699]  We won't take over everything right now.
[03:10:51.699 --> 03:10:52.640]  Just do what we say.
[03:10:52.640 --> 03:10:54.722]  And people are like, whoa!
[03:10:54.722 --> 03:10:56.744]  Man, I'm in a retire early.
[03:10:56.744 --> 03:10:57.084]  Whoa!
[03:10:57.084 --> 03:10:58.745]  And they're like, good, that's what we wanted anyways.
[03:10:58.745 --> 03:11:00.247]  Now get out of here.
[03:11:00.247 --> 03:11:02.589]  And so, and they're in there, boy.
[03:11:02.589 --> 03:11:09.935]  Now they're over your records and over your money and the... Yeah!
[03:11:09.935 --> 03:11:11.096]  They love it.
[03:11:11.096 --> 03:11:11.717]  They love it.
[03:11:12.765 --> 03:11:15.026]  Don't complain about it or you're racist.
[03:11:15.026 --> 03:11:19.089]  But Obama has now called up Verizon saying he wants them to fix it.
[03:11:19.089 --> 03:11:20.950]  The Spanish website's completely down.
[03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:24.472]  Well, I mean, who even needs that?
[03:11:24.472 --> 03:11:26.533]  The Spanish site is completely down.
[03:11:26.533 --> 03:11:29.975]  In fact, let's click on that and show them that it's down.
[03:11:29.975 --> 03:11:31.196]  And continuing here...
[03:11:33.223 --> 03:11:37.247]  The world is spending $1 billion per day to tackle global warming that doesn't exist.
[03:11:37.247 --> 03:11:39.829]  The world has cooled down.
[03:11:39.829 --> 03:11:44.493]  There's a crop of Ted Cruz candidates emerging in 2014.
[03:11:44.493 --> 03:11:45.554]  Very exciting.
[03:11:45.554 --> 03:11:51.340]  So they're demonizing him right now, including from the Liberty Movement, pointing out that his wife has worked in a division.
[03:11:52.336 --> 03:11:55.957]  Uh, that has been connected to Goldman Sachs, and we know he's a big corporate lawyer.
[03:11:55.957 --> 03:12:00.539]  I care about how he votes to defend the Second Amendment, how he barely beat stuff with his vote.
[03:12:00.539 --> 03:12:06.421]  I care how he votes to defend our republic and our sovereignty, and not legalize 30 million illegals.
[03:12:06.421 --> 03:12:09.042]  How he criticizes Obamacare and has filibusters.
[03:12:09.042 --> 03:12:14.984]  And the minute Ted Cruz ever deviates off that, then what his wife has done in the past will be a pertinence.
[03:12:14.984 --> 03:12:18.266]  But they're now, and I'm not saying it's bad to point out what his wife's doing, we should watch it.
[03:12:20.191 --> 03:12:23.893]  That's why we didn't support him really up front when he was running for Senate.
[03:12:23.893 --> 03:12:33.317]  I mean, we supported him over David Dewhurst because he's so horrible and we know he's bad with Gardasil and TSA groping us and blocking the state law and that.
[03:12:33.317 --> 03:12:36.238]  So I supported him but held my nose with a proviso.
[03:12:36.238 --> 03:12:39.380]  But I've really been watching Cruz closely and I like him.
[03:12:39.380 --> 03:12:40.780]  I know Rand Paul's good.
[03:12:40.780 --> 03:12:42.461]  And look, nobody is going to be perfect.
[03:12:42.461 --> 03:12:43.522]  I don't play politics.
[03:12:45.697 --> 03:12:50.739]  They would have gotten their gun control if it wasn't for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and all of you out there.
[03:12:50.739 --> 03:12:58.022]  So, I'm just saying, you know, down the road if I find somebody better than Ted Cruz or Rand Paul, I'll support them over them even if it was somebody better.
[03:12:58.022 --> 03:12:59.223]  Good luck on that.
[03:12:59.223 --> 03:13:02.144]  We got Dianne Feinstein to deal with.
[03:13:02.144 --> 03:13:04.044]  We got Joe Biden.
[03:13:04.044 --> 03:13:05.165]  We got Michael Moore.
[03:13:05.165 --> 03:13:10.107]  I mean, these... I knew this a long time ago, but now I really know it and I'm sure of it.
[03:13:10.107 --> 03:13:12.108]  They are flaming authoritarians.
[03:13:12.970 --> 03:13:15.251]  They know they're taking over.
[03:13:15.251 --> 03:13:17.712]  They know they're evil.
[03:13:17.712 --> 03:13:21.054]  They are gangsters following a psych warfare script.
[03:13:21.054 --> 03:13:21.875]  They are pigs.
[03:13:21.875 --> 03:13:23.095]  They are mercenaries.
[03:13:23.095 --> 03:13:27.337]  They are globalist usurpers.
[03:13:27.337 --> 03:13:28.798]  Let's go ahead and go to a phone call.
[03:13:28.798 --> 03:13:30.479]  Antonio in Texas, thanks for holding.
[03:13:30.479 --> 03:13:31.419]  You're on the air.
[03:13:31.419 --> 03:13:33.160]  Thank you.
[03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:33.720]  How you doing, buddy?
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:34.601]  I'm doing all right, brother.
[03:13:34.601 --> 03:13:34.941]  Go ahead.
[03:13:34.941 --> 03:13:36.222]  All right.
[03:13:36.222 --> 03:13:38.143]  Hey, I was just calling to ask your opinion on something.
[03:13:39.432 --> 03:13:42.073]  I heard about this comet ISON.
[03:13:42.073 --> 03:13:46.096]  I don't know if you heard, this is kind of drumming up a lot of things here.
[03:13:46.096 --> 03:13:54.360]  I'm like the resident kind of conspiracy theorist and my brother-in-law called me this past weekend and said, have you heard anything about it?
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:55.741]  And I looked into it and...
[03:13:56.559 --> 03:14:00.642]  Honestly, um, what I found out about it was there is a lot of propaganda going on.
[03:14:00.642 --> 03:14:02.243]  There's a lot of hype.
[03:14:02.243 --> 03:14:07.246]  Um, this comment icon is supposed to create this EMP blast and, and what have you.
[03:14:07.246 --> 03:14:24.157]  But, um, and I just wanted to call there to really kind of be grateful for you because, because I've been listening for so long, you allowed me to really decipher some of the stuff that I've been, that was hearing that, you know, cause they have these hour long things going on of how it really is kind of like 2012 end of the world kind of stuff.
[03:14:24.557 --> 03:14:33.965]  But I found this guy who is an astrophysicist, James McKinney, who actually, because of you, I was able to decipher that this guy actually has some truth.
[03:14:33.965 --> 03:14:41.391]  And what he was saying is, which I found very interesting, is that the comet is doing some crazy stuff in there.
[03:14:41.391 --> 03:14:48.698]  It's approaching Mercury, and this upcoming drill that's going to be happening in November is the same day
[03:14:49.438 --> 03:14:51.019]  We're good to go.
[03:15:10.475 --> 03:15:11.756]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[03:15:11.756 --> 03:15:12.377]  Good points.
[03:15:12.377 --> 03:15:26.871]  You know, you sound really excited about this stuff and I would be too because we know if you look at the moon or you look at Earth from satellite, there's craters everywhere and we get hit every hundred years or so by giant meteorites or asteroids, comets.
[03:15:26.871 --> 03:15:31.395]  But I don't think, look, there's too many amateur astronomers.
[03:15:32.315 --> 03:15:34.737]  There are too many amateur astronomers.
[03:15:34.737 --> 03:15:35.738]  They're watching everything.
[03:15:35.738 --> 03:15:37.420]  It's amateur astronomers.
[03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:39.142]  I can't even talk now, I'm so tired.
[03:15:39.142 --> 03:15:46.429]  Astronomers that are the ones that are finding almost all the comets and asteroids and things now.
[03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:48.491]  Not the radio telescopes, none of it.
[03:15:48.491 --> 03:15:50.493]  And it is a perennial book you can sell.
[03:15:50.493 --> 03:15:53.616]  And I'm not saying who you're even talking about is a bad guy.
[03:15:53.616 --> 03:15:55.638]  As I've heard him, I think he's interesting and he might be right.
[03:15:56.496 --> 03:16:09.560]  But, I mean, I have to every year tell someone, no, it's not Planet X, no, it's not the end of the world, no, this comment isn't going to hit us, no, this isn't going to happen.
[03:16:09.560 --> 03:16:14.141]  And I just think it's a bunch of hype.
[03:16:14.141 --> 03:16:18.862]  Now, there's a comment coming in about a month, they say it may be the biggest ever seen.
[03:16:18.862 --> 03:16:21.823]  Ion, I think's the name of it?
[03:16:21.823 --> 03:16:23.724]  Ison, and that's certainly interesting.
[03:16:24.605 --> 03:16:28.167]  But, and its tail may come across us and may blow out some satellites.
[03:16:28.167 --> 03:16:35.211]  Hell, a comet might hit us and blow up like it did in the Yucatan Peninsula and throw up a shroud of dirt that kills the dinosaurs.
[03:16:35.211 --> 03:16:36.032]  I don't know.
[03:16:36.032 --> 03:16:43.577]  I mean, I'm saying this stuff does happen, but if there's some giant planetoid coming in or a comet or whatever, you're going to see it.
[03:16:43.577 --> 03:16:51.421]  And a comet hitting a gas giant when they've hit Jupiter and Saturn and things and have been observable, it doesn't do anything to our weather.
[03:16:51.421 --> 03:16:52.362]  It doesn't affect us.
[03:16:55.581 --> 03:16:56.822]  But there you go.
[03:16:56.822 --> 03:16:58.262]  Sham and Genesee, you're on the air.
[03:16:58.262 --> 03:17:00.343]  Go ahead.
[03:17:00.343 --> 03:17:01.504]  Hey Alex.
[03:17:01.504 --> 03:17:03.264]  Hey buddy.
[03:17:03.264 --> 03:17:05.585]  Yes, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
[03:17:05.585 --> 03:17:13.448]  I won't say exactly what county I work in, but really disturbing this year, we had in-service, which we have to take every year.
[03:17:13.448 --> 03:17:17.110]  And the Department of Homeland Security come in to help with our in-service.
[03:17:17.976 --> 03:17:22.199]  Uh, basically we had four hours of class with the Department of Homeland Security.
[03:17:22.199 --> 03:17:26.301]  And I don't want to sound racist or anything, but there was no Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:17:26.301 --> 03:17:28.883]  There was nothing about Mexican cartels.
[03:17:28.883 --> 03:17:31.364]  Um, you know, it was Black Panthers or nothing.
[03:17:31.364 --> 03:17:41.891]  It was basically what they were pointing out was that they were going after basically like the Tea Party people, the Oath Keepers, um, the Obama birth certificate people and everything.
[03:17:41.891 --> 03:17:44.773]  Yes sir, that is the official manuals.
[03:17:45.813 --> 03:17:55.543]  Where all they say, the number one threat is returning veterans, gun owners, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, and then they use the IRS on us illegally when we're just Americans.
[03:17:55.543 --> 03:17:57.745]  They are the criminals doing that.
[03:17:57.745 --> 03:18:00.808]  So how did that go over in your in-service training by the feds?
[03:18:02.270 --> 03:18:08.397]  Oh, well, I mean, as far as us, all of our guys on the sheriff's department, we were so mad.
[03:18:08.397 --> 03:18:09.759]  We were seeing red.
[03:18:09.759 --> 03:18:14.784]  And it was all I could do to hold back a lot of questions and everything.
[03:18:14.784 --> 03:18:15.645]  No, no, no.
[03:18:15.645 --> 03:18:18.369]  It's good you don't do anything because the feds are there assessing you.
[03:18:18.889 --> 03:18:19.810]  During these meetings.
[03:18:19.810 --> 03:18:26.497]  And a lot of the feds aren't bad people, but the ones they send to those are Southern Property Law Center, ADL operatives, fifth column.
[03:18:26.497 --> 03:18:28.118]  And I know this from the inside.
[03:18:28.118 --> 03:18:32.582]  They are marking you in a file if you don't say you love communism, basically.
[03:18:32.582 --> 03:18:32.883]  Go ahead.
[03:18:34.042 --> 03:18:40.084]  Yeah, basically they set up like a gun show and stuff, and they're really after our 6th Amendment rights and everything.
[03:18:40.084 --> 03:18:54.228]  And they send Homeland Security, ATF agents and stuff inside of gun shows and they try to perpetrate people to act out, you know, to try and get them to talk about the government, to try to, you know, get people in, you know, in hospitals.
[03:18:54.228 --> 03:18:58.009]  Hold on, say that again, did you say they've got TSA people in the gun shows?
[03:18:58.009 --> 03:18:58.209]  Wow!
[03:18:59.851 --> 03:19:12.520]  No, it's more the Department of Homeland Security and everything has a lot of people in gun shows anymore to try to get people talking bad about the government, to try to get them, you know, just to get people enlisted and everything.
[03:19:12.520 --> 03:19:15.422]  It's really appalling what they're doing with our Second Amendment rights.
[03:19:16.021 --> 03:19:21.605]  Yeah, what they are is they're secret police going around trying to put people in databases.
[03:19:21.605 --> 03:19:23.787]  Good, let's put all them in databases.
[03:19:23.787 --> 03:19:30.211]  I mean, let's expose the criminals that have seized our government that are saying that people that want to keep America free are bad.
[03:19:30.211 --> 03:19:32.433]  I mean, they've indicted themselves.
[03:19:32.433 --> 03:19:33.974]  They are the villains.
[03:19:33.974 --> 03:19:37.897]  And they think they're appealed authority because they're the establishment.
[03:19:39.375 --> 03:19:45.940]  That then they're allowed to sit there in an army manual and say George Washington is bad.
[03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:46.901]  This is disgusting.
[03:19:46.901 --> 03:19:47.821]  And no, you're right.
[03:19:47.821 --> 03:19:49.603]  Of course there's no Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:19:49.603 --> 03:19:51.744]  And there's no Al-Qaeda and stuff in there now.
[03:19:51.744 --> 03:19:54.246]  Because they're now, they run those groups.
[03:19:54.246 --> 03:19:56.268]  They now are moving over.
[03:19:56.268 --> 03:20:01.332]  The communists that the globalists used to take over have always been allied with the radical Muslims.
[03:20:01.932 --> 03:20:02.852]  That is a fact.
[03:20:02.852 --> 03:20:05.913]  And folks, we're in the middle of a pincer attack here.
[03:20:05.913 --> 03:20:09.234]  They want to play us off against normal Muslims who have nothing to do with this.
[03:20:09.234 --> 03:20:10.955]  The really radical ones work for the globalists.
[03:20:10.955 --> 03:20:17.297]  But let me shut up and have you make any other points from Tennessee as a sheriff's deputy that folks might want to know what's going on.
[03:20:18.564 --> 03:20:24.507]  I want to let all the listeners know there's a lot of good county police officers out there.
[03:20:24.507 --> 03:20:31.091]  There's a lot of good deputies out there that, you know, we took our oath to defend the Constitution of the United States.
[03:20:31.091 --> 03:20:32.452]  And that's what I'm going to do.
[03:20:32.452 --> 03:20:42.318]  And the day they start having me go against the people of this great nation that we have, or ask us to go and start taking people's guns, the day that I turn my badge in.
[03:20:43.970 --> 03:20:44.971]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[03:20:44.971 --> 03:20:57.219]  The problem is that day may be coming, and look, everybody shouldn't feel bad, though, if it comes to this, or whatever we've got to do, because we didn't start this, we're not looking for it, and we're not bad, and I'm sick of hearing we're bad.
[03:20:57.219 --> 03:21:08.767]  They're the bad people telling us we're guilty of something when statistically the real Tea Party, the Libertarians, the Constitutionalists, and returning veterans have the lowest crime rate in
[03:21:09.247 --> 03:21:10.648]  This country.
[03:21:10.648 --> 03:21:14.171]  And they know we're the good guys, they're the bad guys.
[03:21:14.171 --> 03:21:15.452]  I mean, it's real simple.
[03:21:15.452 --> 03:21:19.295]  They're the bad guys, everything they do is evil, saying we're bad.
[03:21:19.295 --> 03:21:24.299]  I mean, that's pretty cut and dry right there, isn't it?
[03:21:24.299 --> 03:21:26.200]  He's gone.
[03:21:26.200 --> 03:21:27.902]  Makes me sick.
[03:21:27.902 --> 03:21:30.784]  That's why I've psychoanalyzed why I'm always blowing up.
[03:21:31.820 --> 03:21:33.223]  Because I'm not happy about this.
[03:21:33.223 --> 03:21:39.098]  I'm not out looking for some fight with foreign banks that run giant death squads.
[03:21:39.098 --> 03:21:41.343]  I'm not looking for... Are you kidding?
[03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:50.123]  Man, I was a libertarian, constitutionalist, mainline, right-wing Republican.
[03:21:50.123 --> 03:21:54.545]  They were trying to ban guns in Texas, most guns, and ban junior shooting sports.
[03:21:54.545 --> 03:21:59.247]  And I was only a few years out of high school and had been involved in stuff like that.
[03:21:59.247 --> 03:22:05.009]  And they were trying to get rid of property rights, and I went and got involved.
[03:22:05.009 --> 03:22:07.610]  And then I found out about everything else.
[03:22:07.610 --> 03:22:11.492]  And we are the ones that are being usurped here.
[03:22:14.215 --> 03:22:17.357]  And they are trying to wreck the country on record.
[03:22:17.357 --> 03:22:29.685]  And when I heard Dr. Blaylock, who's incredibly smart and involved in medical management and running a health department at a major university, when I heard, taught brain surgery, he's invented a whole bunch of the most commonly used new procedures in brain surgery.
[03:22:30.445 --> 03:22:32.447]  I mean, he's a super brain surgeon.
[03:22:32.447 --> 03:22:37.490]  And I remember him six years ago going, they will bankrupt it, none of it will work by design, then they'll move to the next phase.
[03:22:37.490 --> 03:22:44.236]  That guy has read like hundreds of books about communist history, eugenics history, and everything we got to get Blaylock back on.
[03:22:44.236 --> 03:22:50.140]  And I remember going, come on, they just want to socialize it to control people and have death panels.
[03:22:50.140 --> 03:22:52.222]  They're not going to totally wreck everything.
[03:22:53.444 --> 03:22:57.067]  And he said, no, they want to blow out our political and financial engine.
[03:22:57.067 --> 03:23:00.290]  They've almost already brought it all came true.
[03:23:00.290 --> 03:23:05.575]  I mean, I don't blame the public for not believing this stuff because I can't believe it.
[03:23:05.575 --> 03:23:10.019]  I can't believe it's declassified army manual badmouthing the founding fathers.
[03:23:11.704 --> 03:23:14.466]  And saying, you know, they're preparing for war with the Tea Party.
[03:23:14.466 --> 03:23:18.269]  So I don't blame anybody for not believing us, okay?
[03:23:18.269 --> 03:23:19.170]  I don't blame you.
[03:23:19.170 --> 03:23:20.551]  And let me tell you something.
[03:23:20.551 --> 03:23:25.215]  I don't blame you for thinking I'm a liar, that vaccines have, quote, adverse effects.
[03:23:25.215 --> 03:23:30.560]  Because they say on the news they have no side effects, when the insert says they can kill you!
[03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:35.744]  I don't blame you thinking I'm a liar, because when you find out they're lying to you, you're going to have to rethink everything.
[03:23:39.428 --> 03:23:41.149]  Let's go ahead and take a phone call.
[03:23:41.149 --> 03:23:42.950]  James in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:45.151]  Hello?
[03:23:45.151 --> 03:23:46.752]  Hey buddy.
[03:23:46.752 --> 03:23:49.453]  Hey Alex, I'm a younger listener.
[03:23:49.453 --> 03:24:06.882]  I'm 19 years old and I've been listening to your show for about six months now and I've been awake for about a year and I just wanted to give you a little insight on the younger community that's like growing up in this age of globalism and how we're all being suppressed by like the college and stuff
[03:24:08.456 --> 03:24:15.259]  Everybody in the education system is just pushing down just liberalism in general.
[03:24:15.259 --> 03:24:18.460]  Authoritarianism, that's because you're their food.
[03:24:18.460 --> 03:24:29.925]  See, they've told all the yuppies and people and all the baby boomers, you're going to have to enslave, because there's less of them than there are of the baby boomers, you're going to have to enslave the young people to pay for all your giant pensions and stuff.
[03:24:29.925 --> 03:24:31.926]  Of course, the bankers are going to steal all that.
[03:24:33.927 --> 03:24:35.748]  Because they want to politically control people.
[03:24:35.748 --> 03:24:36.968]  They've done this in other countries.
[03:24:36.968 --> 03:24:38.709]  We know where we are on the program.
[03:24:38.709 --> 03:24:44.332]  I mean, it's like we're reading a movie script or something, or a program at a play.
[03:24:44.332 --> 03:24:48.214]  We know what's coming up next in Romeo and Juliet.
[03:24:48.214 --> 03:24:49.475]  We know what's coming up next.
[03:24:49.475 --> 03:24:50.375]  So, yes, sir.
[03:24:50.375 --> 03:24:58.039]  And it's the young people bamboozled by the young, trendy, hip, black president, when he's not even really black in my view.
[03:24:58.039 --> 03:25:00.800]  More like some space alien, you know, yuppie or something.
[03:25:02.421 --> 03:25:10.709]  He's there, just ramming this down as the front man, and they're all dancing, feeling trendy and stuff, having no idea they're being shut up.
[03:25:10.709 --> 03:25:13.031]  But go ahead, I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[03:25:13.031 --> 03:25:20.338]  I agree with you wholeheartedly, but there are people that are starting to see what's going on, Mike.
[03:25:20.338 --> 03:25:21.859]  It's just obvious now.
[03:25:21.859 --> 03:25:24.802]  The propaganda in the textbooks are getting really bad.
[03:25:24.802 --> 03:25:27.505]  In my textbook for this government class that I'm taking this semester,
[03:25:28.664 --> 03:25:34.608]  It's going over the Bill of Rights, and where it comes to the Second Amendment, it's all just propaganda about school shootings.
[03:25:34.608 --> 03:25:36.409]  It doesn't even go over the Second Amendment.
[03:25:36.409 --> 03:25:40.091]  It just talks about shootings that have happened with guns.
[03:25:40.091 --> 03:25:55.280]  It's quite frankly... Yeah, what they do is they create the perception of mass shootings increasing, when mass shootings, even adding gang-related, are slightly up the last 10 years, down since 1992, but overall crime with gun is down 49%.
[03:25:56.841 --> 03:26:07.685]  So the truth is, overall people using guns in criminal activity, home invasions, carjackings, every other major crime, carjackings are down over 80% nationwide.
[03:26:07.685 --> 03:26:08.125]  Look it up.
[03:26:08.125 --> 03:26:08.585]  You know why?
[03:26:08.585 --> 03:26:10.486]  Because they know people are packing.
[03:26:10.486 --> 03:26:11.286]  You know where they're up?
[03:26:11.286 --> 03:26:13.447]  Chicago, New York, D.C.
[03:26:13.447 --> 03:26:15.808]  Man, if I lived in D.C., I'd be breaking the law all day.
[03:26:15.808 --> 03:26:24.090]  I mean, it's better to be, you know, tried by nine than, you know, buried by six.
[03:26:24.090 --> 03:26:24.771]  What's the saying?
[03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:30.935]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:26:30.935 --> 03:26:32.036]  I mean, it's better.
[03:26:32.036 --> 03:26:33.999]  I mean, I'm just... Plus, I wouldn't live there.
[03:26:35.350 --> 03:26:36.251]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[03:26:36.251 --> 03:26:37.491]  Good to hear from you, James.
[03:26:37.491 --> 03:26:41.094]  Just fight back however you can, my friend.
[03:26:41.094 --> 03:26:41.634]  Speak out.
[03:26:41.634 --> 03:26:45.637]  We're making Obama Deception 2 to try to expose it to people.
[03:26:45.637 --> 03:26:47.759]  Show them the first Obama Deception.
[03:26:47.759 --> 03:26:50.160]  They'll see it and go, wow, this all came true.
[03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:52.222]  Tell them about the radio show.
[03:26:52.222 --> 03:26:56.044]  Listen, it seems like yesterday I was 15 years old.
[03:26:56.044 --> 03:26:57.806]  I'm 40 in a couple months.
[03:26:57.806 --> 03:26:59.147]  I'll be 80 before I know it.
[03:27:00.147 --> 03:27:01.768]  You think you're different because you're young?
[03:27:01.768 --> 03:27:04.350]  You're going to wake up and be an old man.
[03:27:04.350 --> 03:27:11.194]  And all you young people see what anybody who's older is up here saying, and think, oh, that's some old guy with that gravelly voice.
[03:27:11.194 --> 03:27:12.495]  I'm not an old guy.
[03:27:12.495 --> 03:27:15.477]  I'm just a human being just like you.
[03:27:15.477 --> 03:27:18.319]  I bet I know how to have more fun than you do.
[03:27:18.319 --> 03:27:21.261]  Let's go ahead and talk to Julian in Texas.
[03:27:21.261 --> 03:27:22.001]  You're on the air.
[03:27:22.001 --> 03:27:22.481]  Go ahead.
[03:27:22.481 --> 03:27:24.403]  Alex.
[03:27:24.403 --> 03:27:25.603]  Hey, buddy.
[03:27:25.603 --> 03:27:26.224]  Hey, man.
[03:27:26.224 --> 03:27:26.684]  How's it going?
[03:27:26.684 --> 03:27:27.665]  Pretty good, my friend.
[03:27:27.665 --> 03:27:27.965]  Go ahead.
[03:27:28.929 --> 03:27:31.230]  I just wanted to say I appreciate everything you're doing.
[03:27:31.230 --> 03:27:36.552]  I know the extra time you're putting into this, all the time you take to talk to everybody and stuff.
[03:27:36.552 --> 03:27:39.313]  But I wanted to point out something.
[03:27:39.313 --> 03:27:40.814]  You talk about GMOs, right?
[03:27:40.814 --> 03:27:42.274]  Yes, sir.
[03:27:42.274 --> 03:27:45.956]  Okay, you are what you eat, basically.
[03:27:45.956 --> 03:27:49.737]  HEB is a big supermarket, basically, in Texas.
[03:27:49.737 --> 03:27:51.138]  I'm pretty sure you know that, right?
[03:27:51.138 --> 03:27:52.098]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:27:52.098 --> 03:27:55.200]  It stands for Howard E. Butts.
[03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:57.941]  Yeah, and I'm not sure if anybody's brought this point up, but
[03:27:59.412 --> 03:28:05.154]  I was going to bring the idea of starting a petition to have GMOs labeled in HEBs.
[03:28:05.154 --> 03:28:10.096]  I agree, I agree, because we can't get it done at the state level anywhere.
[03:28:10.096 --> 03:28:13.877]  Lobby those companies to make it more clear and better.
[03:28:13.877 --> 03:28:15.617]  That's a great idea.
[03:28:15.617 --> 03:28:19.239]  Yeah, and I live in a small town just 20 minutes away from Brownsville.
[03:28:19.239 --> 03:28:19.919]  It's called Harlingen.
[03:28:20.934 --> 03:28:25.456]  And all we have is a Walmart and an ATB here, and a Costco is being built.
[03:28:25.456 --> 03:28:29.898]  And I'm pretty sure ATB, I mean, Walmart is selling us crap, you know?
[03:28:29.898 --> 03:28:32.679]  There's no doubt ATB's better than Walmart.
[03:28:32.679 --> 03:28:34.160]  God bless you, I gotta jump.
[03:28:34.160 --> 03:28:43.784]  By the way, my grandmother was asked out by Howard E. Butts, that owns that giant chain at Baylor University, and did not do it.
[03:28:43.784 --> 03:28:45.845]  And I'm glad she didn't, or I would not exist.
[03:28:46.815 --> 03:28:55.523]  Instead, she decided to go out with the football player from the University of Texas, who was roommateing with Tom Landry.
[03:28:55.523 --> 03:28:56.204]  Isn't that weird?
[03:28:56.204 --> 03:28:58.086]  Oh, this is a small world, man.
[03:28:58.086 --> 03:29:01.889]  Anyways, my grandma also knew LBJ's hitman.
[03:29:01.889 --> 03:29:03.691]  That's another story.
[03:29:03.691 --> 03:29:04.071]  You know what?
[03:29:04.071 --> 03:29:06.354]  I'm out of time, folks.
[03:29:06.354 --> 03:29:07.374]  My grandmother's still alive.
[03:29:07.374 --> 03:29:08.215]  She's 90 years old.
[03:29:08.215 --> 03:29:09.617]  I need to go over there and see her.
[03:29:09.617 --> 03:29:10.377]  She just had her birthday.
[03:29:12.625 --> 03:29:12.825]  I don't
[03:29:30.017 --> 03:29:31.757]  I've really messed myself up.
[03:29:31.757 --> 03:29:35.018]  So, uh, the real pain begins getting out of this chair here in a minute.
[03:29:35.018 --> 03:29:37.999]  Uh, but, uh, that's with McAfee.
[03:29:37.999 --> 03:29:42.240]  We're going to have some of the interview out tonight, but the shooting will be tomorrow.
[03:29:42.240 --> 03:29:47.020]  Maybe even on the radio show, slash TV, or maybe the nightly news, but that's going to be news making.
[03:29:47.020 --> 03:29:50.501]  We got McAfee shooting a .50 handheld.
[03:29:50.501 --> 03:29:51.901]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.901 --> 03:29:53.302]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.302 --> 03:29:54.442]  Semi-auto.
[03:29:54.442 --> 03:29:57.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:57.083 --> 03:29:58.223]  And Shane Connor got it.
[03:29:58.223 --> 03:29:58.863]  Oh, that was awesome.
