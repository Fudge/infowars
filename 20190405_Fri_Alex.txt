[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:52.000]  Imagine a Stephen King novel, where all over the western world, convicted pedophiles,
[00:52.000 --> 01:02.000]  child rapists and worse, disguised themselves as clowns, they then called themselves drag queens,
[01:02.000 --> 01:10.000]  and while disguised, openly are given admittance to elementary schools, nursery schools, public parks,
[01:10.000 --> 01:15.000]  where they then prey directly on children.
[01:15.000 --> 01:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, a group in Houston has busted their second convicted child rapist.
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.000]  Both men were convicted of raping six-year-old boys.
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.000]  They heavily hid their identities, used multiple aliases, but the group, Mass Resistance,
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  was able to track them and find out their real identities.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  They're now tracking others. I will let you know we are doing it as well.
[01:46.000 --> 01:53.000]  Boots on the ground in New York, Texas and other areas, and our findings are bone-chilling
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  and are being delivered to law enforcement.
[01:56.000 --> 02:04.000]  Bone-chilling, and they are organized out of New York City, directed in England, Germany,
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  France, Belgium, Sweden, Canada, the United States.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  They are commanded by convicted murderers.
[02:15.000 --> 02:23.000]  They are commanded by sinister individuals. You cannot make this up.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  And again, when you go to their Facebook and their Twitter pages, when they're together at a party,
[02:27.000 --> 02:36.000]  they just look like women, but when they go out, it's in full disguise.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  Bombshell, another drag queen story I remember exposed as pedophile investigation shows.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  You can see the live feed broadcast today.
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  And it states that an international cult-like gang disguises itself as clowns and then feeds on children.
[02:56.000 --> 03:02.000]  This is not it, the clown. This is the real it.
[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  And of course, it feeds on the energy of children, on their innocence.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  It's the metaphor for the vampire.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  And so you don't need to go to some distant star system to find some giant spider living under a city
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  feeding on thousands of children over the decades.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  All you have to do is look out your front door at your local public school that has been set up as a feeding nest.
[03:30.000 --> 03:44.000]  A feeding nest where the children are brought right in and handed over to child rapists.
[03:44.000 --> 03:54.000]  Another individual, his first and middle name, William Travis. Thank God he changed his name.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  So it's all coming up. I'm going to have one of the ladies spearheading, exposing these groups. They've done a lot of hard work.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  All of me in the second hour, we're going to get to all of this then.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  But you're definitely going to want to join us coming up today.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  Because you haven't seen them in the demon outfits. That's what I'd request to be on the back screen.
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  But I'll just do it this way. Document cam shot, please.
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  Bombshell, another drag queen story hour member exposed as pedophile investigation shows.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  And in almost all the photos, he's in dominatrix vampire outfits.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  And is walking around with his mouth open like a moray eel hissing at the children.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  Going, ah, children. Oh, with a rubber chicken in his hand saying, come to me my chickens.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  And then he hands them a flower.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  Of course, the chicken is the term for a young boy.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Come to me my chickens.
[04:53.000 --> 05:19.000]  It's as the convicted six year old rapist.
[05:19.000 --> 05:27.000]  A young boy, he does not have a body.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  He has a body of a human.
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  The body of the baby is a powerful probiotic supplement with 20 of the most potent clinically studied probiotic strains.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  When paired with carnivore, our incredible enzyme formula that helps you break down nutrients.

[06:20.820 --> 06:39.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[06:39.820 --> 06:52.820]  We're going toe-to-toe with the Petapol armies, toe-to-toe with the Chai comms, toe-to-toe with Big Tech, toe-to-toe with their command system, the Democratic Party.
[06:53.820 --> 07:00.820]  And now, mainline Americans and others know we're fighting heartless, evil, anti-God globalists.
[07:00.820 --> 07:11.820]  Now, the average American knows their operating system is a anti-human, vampiric system that wants to kill children before they're born, and that they can't do that. They want to drug them out of their minds and suck their soul while they're alive.
[07:12.820 --> 07:18.820]  People know the Democrats are a hardened group, a cult of power and wickedness.
[07:18.820 --> 07:35.820]  And their governors are openly on television, saying we're going to kill babies after they're born, and the government and the courts aren't involved, your children belong to us, and then facilities all over the United States, small children are brought before convicted child rapists dressed as clowns.
[07:35.820 --> 07:49.820]  That's right, drag queen story time is men disguising their identities, dressed as clowns, having their way with their children, and grooming them in their own words. And now we're discovering why they're so heavily disguised.
[07:50.820 --> 07:54.820]  They look like clowns. They don't even look like drag queens because they're disguising themselves.
[07:54.820 --> 08:09.820]  And that's something actually done in the pedo culture, going back at least to the 80s, or even before, is that men that would abuse children would dress as a clown, normally a vampiric clown to horrify them further.
[08:09.820 --> 08:28.820]  And also they would dress as, I guess they call it plushies, or as a stuffed animal or whatever, to really horrify and screw up younger children, furries.
[08:28.820 --> 08:45.820]  And so you need to understand, folks, they mean business. And another one has been busted in Houston. So that's two out of the group. In fact, both that have been convicted, both ring leaders, raped six year old boys.
[08:45.820 --> 08:57.820]  That's their convictions. You can read the rap sheet and everything at info wars.com. That will be in the second hour. We have the lady spearheading it with mass resistance is the name of the group.
[08:59.820 --> 09:02.820]  We have her joining us in the second hour.
[09:02.820 --> 09:29.820]  Pro family activism mass resistance calm. So they're going to be joining us coming up today. And I will get it all of it in in depth expose in the second hour. But this is literal gang of sickos, many of them convicted pedophiles, working with governments around the United States and the world, given access to many cases without telling
[09:29.820 --> 09:36.820]  parents to public schools, elementary schools, you name it, libraries to target your children.
[09:37.820 --> 09:47.820]  And we have shocking video of the children being targeted and sitting on their laps and being given roses.
[09:47.820 --> 10:02.820]  Which is a red rose is a sign of passion, sign of wanting to obviously date someone to explain it to folks and then saying you want to pet the chicken, want to touch the chicken, which is the term for young boy.
[10:03.820 --> 10:04.820]  That is a fact in the FBI manual.
[10:04.820 --> 10:16.820]  So I'm sorry to learn about all this stuff together, but our children are being hit and hit hard. And so that is coming up in the second hour. I'm going to stop there.
[10:17.820 --> 10:27.820]  And I will tell you viewer discretion is advised in the second hour. Viewer discretion is advised because this is scarier than any Stephen King novel.
[10:27.820 --> 10:37.820]  This is the real group of men, many of them convicted pedophiles, dressed as clowns, given access to your children.
[10:38.820 --> 10:40.820]  Even the local news, let's cue that back up next hour.
[10:41.820 --> 10:45.820]  They were introducing it last year. Oh, it's so great. Some mean people don't like it.
[10:46.820 --> 10:51.820]  And it said the kids got scared and pulled away, but the anchor goes, but you got to get them while they're young. They'll learn.
[10:51.820 --> 11:00.820]  Like we're in some alternate, you know, there it is, like we're in some alternate dimension.
[11:01.820 --> 11:06.820]  Hell, since you pulled it up so quick, let's go ahead and just play it for people and I'll hit all the second hour. Here it is.
[11:07.820 --> 11:13.820]  The Heights Public Library today, debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Storytime.
[11:14.820 --> 11:17.820]  Stephanie Woodfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[11:17.820 --> 11:24.820]  Good morning, everybody. The Heights Library had a special guest for Storytime.
[11:25.820 --> 11:29.820]  Oh my goodness. Everyone is dressed so nice. I wish I would award a nice costume for y'all.
[11:30.820 --> 11:33.820]  A visitor who usually performs for an older audience.
[11:34.820 --> 11:42.820]  My name is Blackberry. I'm a bearded drag queen. That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair. Do you want to touch my hair? No.
[11:42.820 --> 11:46.820]  This program is geared towards kids 10 years old and younger.
[11:47.820 --> 11:49.820]  I just want to expose them to things they don't get to see every day.
[11:50.820 --> 11:57.820]  Pause again. Back it up 10 seconds, please. Well, why don't you take them like one of my crew members said to Fallujah and they can watch him beheading her.
[11:58.820 --> 12:05.820]  How about you go down to Skid Row and watch somebody inject heroin or how about you go down to Mexico to a leopard colony and see people with their faces melting off.
[12:05.820 --> 12:16.820]  You know, let them have something to experience. How about a 400 pound black guy with a huge beard saying I'm a lady to kids that are recoiling scared saying you want to touch my beard.
[12:17.820 --> 12:29.820]  And then the kids come and sit on their laps and at this very event, not one but two convicted child rapists operating with aliases wearing disguises.
[12:29.820 --> 12:35.820]  You know how many banks have been robbed by people dressed like clowns? A lot. You know how many liquor stores?
[12:36.820 --> 12:41.820]  You know how many people have been tortured to death by men dressed like clowns? John Wayne Gacy, when they go further?
[12:44.820 --> 12:52.820]  These poor children. But this guy is not a convicted pedophile. Little birdies told me he's had his background run.
[12:52.820 --> 13:01.820]  No, it's the people that are there. But this is who they chose as the best example because we're going to show you what actually happened at these events next hour.
[13:02.820 --> 13:12.820]  The kids sitting on the laps getting petted. The chickens. All of it. You're going to see all of it next hour. This is America 2019.
[13:14.820 --> 13:20.820]  Now, we've got huge overload of incredible news when we come back from break. I'm going to get to everything.
[13:20.820 --> 13:25.820]  Vatican Cardinal Warren's West will disappear because of mass migration.
[13:26.820 --> 13:31.820]  Rand Paul blocking release of Mueller report, the fourth investigation of Clinton coming. Brennan, absolutely.
[13:32.820 --> 13:35.820]  Mexican officials start stammering at what Tucker asked.
[13:36.820 --> 13:38.820]  Mexico won't let migrants remain there.
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.820]  Beto vows to sign reparations bill if president.
[13:42.820 --> 13:48.820]  U.K. police outside Ecuador embassy amid WikiLeaks tweets.
[13:50.820 --> 13:54.820]  MSM claims creepy Joe Biden meme shared by Trump.
[13:55.820 --> 14:02.820]  Dr. No, it's called humor. Also, we're going to get into all the other big news video migrants.
[14:03.820 --> 14:06.820]  That's illegal alien invaders cutting through the bar bar of the U.S. border.
[14:06.820 --> 14:11.820]  We've got Trump supposedly backing off the threat to close the border. That's not good news.
[14:13.820 --> 14:19.820]  It's all coming up, but please do not forget that I've got to end the specials any day now.
[14:20.820 --> 14:25.820]  They will be gone by Monday because I just haven't come up with a new specials yet because this is such a huge special.
[14:25.820 --> 14:36.820]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot points on your next order. That means we spend $10. You get a dollar towards your next order. It's huge.
[14:37.820 --> 14:44.820]  Infowarstore.com, 50 to 60% off all the supplements. A bunch of other big specials. Too many, too numerous to even mention.
[14:45.820 --> 14:52.820]  Take advantage. X2 back in stock. Amazing. We've never offered it at this much off, but I want you to see how great the good allergen is.
[14:52.820 --> 14:58.820]  We've also got bodies, ultimate tumor formula. It's about to sell out. All three of the fish oils are about to sell out.
[14:59.820 --> 15:05.820]  That's why I've got to end this mega special. Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is very close to selling out. People are stocking up on it.
[15:05.820 --> 15:22.820]  Infowarstore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. But the biggest thing you can do for your own health and your own body is learn about bio, PQQ, CoQ10. We've had a very strong, organically delivered formula of it.
[15:23.820 --> 15:30.820]  That would be normally sold for $300, $400 because they put seven times markup on it. No ladies and gentlemen, we have almost no markup on it when it's 60% off.
[15:30.820 --> 15:36.820]  So it's a good deal at a hundred and something dollars. It costs thousands of dollars a kilo just for the PQQ, the CoQ10, and the rest of it.
[15:37.820 --> 15:44.820]  This is really an amazing formula for your telomeres, for your body, for your nerves, just for everything. It's as close to a fountain of youth that God's giving us as anything out there.

[17:03.820 --> 17:20.820]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control. After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs. After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[17:21.820 --> 17:29.820]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested.

[17:58.820 --> 18:16.820]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:16.820 --> 18:36.820]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:36.820 --> 18:50.820]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.820 --> 18:58.820]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[18:58.820 --> 19:07.820]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[19:08.820 --> 19:18.820]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day, but thanks to supermailvitality at infowarsstore.com, I still have that energy.
[19:18.820 --> 19:29.820]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[19:30.820 --> 19:39.820]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy, and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:39.820 --> 19:51.820]  So go to infowarsstore.com and get supermailvitality before it's gone. This is actually our last run of supermailvitality, so I want you to experience supermailvitality before it's too late.
[19:51.820 --> 20:09.820]  Unleash the supermail in you with supermailvitality from infowarsstore.com.
[20:21.820 --> 20:45.820]  There must be some kind of way out of here. Say that joke up to the beat. There's too much confusion. I can't get no relief.
[20:45.820 --> 20:56.820]  Okay, before we tackle the organized globalist invasion of the Europe and the U.S., that even top Vatican cardinals are saying is a planned take down to the West,
[20:57.820 --> 21:02.820]  and that the Pope is basically wrong for what he's doing. This is getting wild. That's coming up next segment.
[21:03.820 --> 21:09.820]  Before we get to all the news I have about Muslims selling women into sex slavery all over the Middle East and Africa, it's actually expanding,
[21:09.820 --> 21:15.820]  and the left will never call it Islamic sex slavery, but that's what it is. We're going to be looking at that.
[21:16.820 --> 21:24.820]  I've got so much I want to get to, but first, let's get into MSM, Kellan McBrane article from infowars.com.
[21:25.820 --> 21:32.820]  MSM claims creepy Biden meme by Carpe Doncombe. He's been one of our contest winners before, big listener.
[21:32.820 --> 21:39.820]  Carpe Doncombe gets tweeted all the time by the president. MSM claims creepy Biden meme shared by Trump doctored.
[21:40.820 --> 21:48.820]  And Biden tweeted, of course, that yes, this is very presidential by the president faking this video.
[21:49.820 --> 21:59.820]  No, it'd be fake if it was meant to fool somebody. It's ridiculously like a stick figure coming up behind him like something you'd see on Saturday Night Live if they were still funny.
[21:59.820 --> 22:11.820]  And so it's got Biden making his excuses for his bizarre behavior while another Biden pops up behind him and comes over and then begins smelling his hair and rubbing on him.
[22:12.820 --> 22:23.820]  It's hilarious. And then I love how the left acts like that, oh, Trump got caught lying again, political fact. That actually wasn't Biden doing that.
[22:23.820 --> 22:30.820]  It was fake. Trump appeared to be trying to mislead the public that Biden had groped Biden.
[22:31.820 --> 22:38.820]  You know, they've actually done stuff like that before when Trump said, wow, look at this, we've got hamburgers a mile high.
[22:39.820 --> 22:42.820]  We bought all those hamburgers for the football teams at the White House as a government shutdown.
[22:43.820 --> 22:47.820]  And they actually had the fact checking sites breathlessly. Actually, the hamburgers weren't a mile high.
[22:47.820 --> 22:55.820]  They were probably 500 hamburgers. And if you stack the hamburgers on top of each other, each hamburger being two inches tall, it would only be so many feet tall.
[22:56.820 --> 23:02.820]  So the president is wrong. The hamburgers are not 500, you know, or a mile higher or whatever.
[23:03.820 --> 23:04.820]  Think about that.
[23:04.820 --> 23:16.820]  Let's roll it with audio. Radio listeners obviously go to infowars.com to see the funny video. It's got 17 million plus views on Twitter alone, even more on Facebook.
[23:17.820 --> 23:19.820]  It's massive on YouTube and it's just funny.
[23:20.820 --> 23:23.820]  But see, the Democrats can't take somebody making fun of them.
[23:24.820 --> 23:31.820]  They have to make it up and say that it's a fake video. Welcome back, Joe. Here's what the president tweeted.
[23:31.820 --> 23:37.820]  I say, kids, I hug people. I grab men and women by the shoulders and say, you can do this.
[23:38.820 --> 23:43.820]  And whether they're women, men, young, old, it's the way I've always been.
[23:44.820 --> 23:46.820]  It's the way I try to show I care about them and I listen.
[23:47.820 --> 23:54.820]  So, remember what happened a few months ago when Jim Acosta wouldn't shut up, asked five questions.
[23:54.820 --> 24:05.820]  They send over the moderator lady that's trying to get the mic away, the assistant, and he pulls it back and pushes her arm down.
[24:06.820 --> 24:11.820]  Now, Democrats would call that murder if it was a Republican. They would exaggerate.
[24:12.820 --> 24:14.820]  But the truth is he just manhandled her and it was not nice.
[24:15.820 --> 24:22.820]  And the president had a reason to ban him from those press conferences for a while because the fact that he was being a disturbance and not just asking one question.
[24:22.820 --> 24:30.820]  Okay? But what did they do? They said, oh, the president tweeted a doctored video.
[24:31.820 --> 24:38.820]  And the next morning the front row said, I've watched it. They zoomed in. It's not a doctored video. They zoomed in.
[24:39.820 --> 24:45.820]  So that's all that's happening here. You zoom in on a video so it's closer. You've doctored it. You know, we changed nothing.
[24:45.820 --> 24:51.820]  You show a joke video. They say it's doctored. These people are totally deceptive.
[24:52.820 --> 25:03.820]  Nobody manipulated it. Give me a break. See, that's just dishonest reporting. All that is is a close up. See, that's just, that is just dishonest reporting.
[25:04.820 --> 25:10.820]  I watched that. I heard that last night. They made it close up. They showed it close up and he was not nice to that young woman.
[25:10.820 --> 25:20.820]  I don't hold them for that because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible, but it was, but all that was when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy because it wasn't doctored.
[25:21.820 --> 25:24.820]  They gave a close up view. That's not doctoring.
[25:25.820 --> 25:33.820]  That's not doctoring. What's doctoring is on CNN not showing the video.
[25:33.820 --> 25:41.820]  We've got that clip and saying they aired a doctored video that showed Biden groping someone.
[25:42.820 --> 25:47.820]  No, it's, it's, it's a joke video. A five year old, a two year old, a three year old would know it was a joke.
[25:48.820 --> 25:52.820]  But that's the level of the deception these people are engaged in.
[25:53.820 --> 26:01.820]  That's why I wanted to lead this segment with that is because he's saying, oh, the president's not being presidential.
[26:01.820 --> 26:04.820]  Let me tell you what's not presidential selling our sovereignty up.
[26:05.820 --> 26:11.820]  What's not presidential is being part of a party that says America was never that great. It'll never be great.
[26:12.820 --> 26:17.820]  It's you guys that are the embarrassment. It's you guys are the problem.
[26:18.820 --> 26:26.820]  It's you guys that belong to the bullies all over the country trying to get people fired because they're wearing a mega hat at a coffee shop.
[26:26.820 --> 26:31.820]  And then, of course, that lady that did that, the old Jewish man in Palo Alto, California, she got fired.
[26:32.820 --> 26:41.820]  That article is up on info wars.com woman who harassed old man in Starbucks over mega hat gets fired left to scream at 74 year old Jewish Trump's Porter is a Nazi.
[26:42.820 --> 26:45.820]  She said, we're coming to your house. We're going to get you a Nazi. We're going to find out where you work.
[26:46.820 --> 26:49.820]  You're going to get fired and her boss from a guitar shop said, we're firing her.
[26:49.820 --> 26:55.820]  We don't like stalking and harassing people. We're trying to unify folks. And this is still America.
[26:56.820 --> 26:59.820]  So the old Jewish man said, you know, this is still America.
[27:00.820 --> 27:02.820]  And I want to get him on as a guest, by the way, if we can.
[27:03.820 --> 27:06.820]  And the fact that it's an act of defiance to wear one out in public.
[27:07.820 --> 27:09.820]  And sure, most of the time you get support or you get ignored.
[27:10.820 --> 27:15.820]  But let me tell you something, wearing a make America great again hat is like being Alex Jones in a leftist area.
[27:15.820 --> 27:21.820]  And just get ready because you just need to not sit with your back to the crowd.
[27:22.820 --> 27:24.820]  Now when I go to a restaurant, they say, where would you like to sit?
[27:25.820 --> 27:27.820]  And if it's in the leftist area, I say, listen, I need to be in a corner.
[27:28.820 --> 27:34.820]  And then I shit facing out because it also entices the left. Remember their cowards instinctively.
[27:35.820 --> 27:39.820]  So they see one old man alone. They're going to try to gang up and she tried to get people to gang up on him, but they refused.
[27:39.820 --> 27:45.820]  But if you've got your back turned, that's every time they've walked over and knocked my drink over, slapped me in the back of the head.
[27:46.820 --> 27:49.820]  Said, we're going to kill you. Said, we're going to get you. Said, we're going to attack you.
[27:50.820 --> 27:58.820]  Every time I had my back to him, I was in a hot tub in Hawaii last year with family vacation, just at the hotel.
[27:59.820 --> 28:03.820]  And this guy would give me dirty looks earlier with the bar, but by the hot tub.
[28:03.820 --> 28:08.820]  And all of a sudden he like walks by and like my arms out on the edge.
[28:09.820 --> 28:11.820]  He steps on my finger a little bit. He goes, oh, sorry. Hey, it's okay.
[28:12.820 --> 28:15.820]  And he goes, yeah, yeah, right. You're going to be sorry.
[28:16.820 --> 28:18.820]  And he was sitting there glaring at me and the guy wouldn't even that big.
[28:19.820 --> 28:22.820]  I was like, dude, I was just like, hey, man, whatever, you're such a great American.
[28:23.820 --> 28:25.820]  And then he goes, hey, look, it's Alex Jones. It's Alex Jones.
[28:26.820 --> 28:28.820]  Don't mind if I get in the hot tub with you. Do you?
[28:28.820 --> 28:33.820]  And my wife and kids were off doing something else. And I just said, you know what?
[28:34.820 --> 28:36.820]  I'm going to let this skate have a great day, buddy.
[28:37.820 --> 28:39.820]  And then I got out and left and then his friends came over and said, man, don't do that.
[28:40.820 --> 28:42.820]  We're going to throw out of the hotel. I saw him getting on to him.
[28:43.820 --> 28:46.820]  By the way, the folks that attacked me at the chicken place, they all got banned from live from there and they got thrown out.
[28:47.820 --> 28:51.820]  I left. I didn't get thrown out like the media says, but again, that's why corporate media's hated.
[28:51.820 --> 28:57.820]  They lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[28:58.820 --> 29:00.820]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me.
[29:01.820 --> 29:02.820]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[29:03.820 --> 29:04.820]  PD stopped eating. All of his hair fell out.
[29:05.820 --> 29:06.820]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[29:07.820 --> 29:08.820]  At least $5,000.
[29:09.820 --> 29:10.820]  And that bill creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[29:11.820 --> 29:12.820]  No results.
[29:13.820 --> 29:14.820]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynabyte.
[29:15.820 --> 29:17.820]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.com
[29:17.820 --> 29:20.820]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you've got to feed this hungry healthy.
[29:21.820 --> 29:22.820]  The Omega-3 fatty acids.
[29:23.820 --> 29:27.820]  Black seed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[29:28.820 --> 29:29.820]  Dynabyte is nutrition.
[29:30.820 --> 29:31.820]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[29:32.820 --> 29:37.820]  Her coat is not soft. It's silky. It's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[29:38.820 --> 29:39.820]  She's got life. She's got energy.
[29:40.820 --> 29:41.820]  Tons of energy. No more bad smells.
[29:41.820 --> 29:46.820]  Dynabyte's the bomb. Dynabyte is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[29:47.820 --> 29:48.820]  You know, besides me, of course.
[29:49.820 --> 29:50.820]  859-428-1000
[29:51.820 --> 29:53.820]  859-428-1000
[29:54.820 --> 29:55.820]  Dynabyte for life.
[29:56.820 --> 29:57.820]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E.com
[30:01.820 --> 30:02.820]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[30:03.820 --> 30:04.820]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[30:05.820 --> 30:09.820]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[30:09.820 --> 30:10.820]  The fish oil is better than it.
[30:11.820 --> 30:12.820]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[30:13.820 --> 30:14.820]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[30:15.820 --> 30:16.820]  Brain, body, heart.
[30:17.820 --> 30:18.820]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[30:19.820 --> 30:20.820]  You've got the children's. You've got the adults.
[30:21.820 --> 30:22.820]  You've got the krill oil.
[30:23.820 --> 30:24.820]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[30:25.820 --> 30:27.820]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[30:28.820 --> 30:29.820]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[30:30.820 --> 30:31.820]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[30:32.820 --> 30:33.820]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[30:34.820 --> 30:35.820]  It's so good. In my view.
[30:36.820 --> 30:37.820]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[30:37.820 --> 30:39.820]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed.
[30:40.820 --> 30:41.820]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[30:43.820 --> 30:47.820]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[30:51.820 --> 30:52.820]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[30:53.820 --> 30:56.820]  But you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[30:57.820 --> 30:58.820]  I just can't do it.
[30:59.820 --> 31:04.820]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[33:26.820 --> 33:27.820]  Thanks, Alex Jones.
[33:57.820 --> 34:00.820]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[34:01.820 --> 34:05.820]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, April 5th, 2019, transmission.
[34:06.820 --> 34:11.820]  And we are about to blow the international pedophile ring wide open.
[34:12.820 --> 34:15.820]  If that doesn't get the globalist shooting at me, nothing will.
[34:16.820 --> 34:17.820]  That's the name of the game.
[34:18.820 --> 34:19.820]  Press the attack.
[34:20.820 --> 34:21.820]  Never back down.
[34:22.820 --> 34:23.820]  That's right.
[34:23.820 --> 34:26.820]  The globalist want to attack me and say, you're not running pedophile rings?
[34:27.820 --> 34:28.820]  Well, get ready.
[34:29.820 --> 34:32.820]  Because a lot of it's coming out and you can't stop humanity.
[34:33.820 --> 34:37.820]  And you can't stop the citizen investigators that are going to destroy your operations.
[34:39.820 --> 34:40.820]  You want to fight?
[34:41.820 --> 34:43.820]  You better believe you got one scumbags.
[34:44.820 --> 34:45.820]  You can run, but you can't hide.
[34:46.820 --> 34:47.820]  And we're coming.
[34:48.820 --> 34:50.820]  That animating collision.
[34:50.820 --> 34:52.820]  That date with destiny.
[34:53.820 --> 34:59.820]  Just when you figure out we're not playing chicken, we want to bang heads with you.
[35:00.820 --> 35:03.820]  We want to collide at full speed into you.
[35:04.820 --> 35:07.820]  We want to destroy you.
[35:08.820 --> 35:15.820]  I have that line from Goldfinger where Sean Connery's trapped and he says, do you expect me to talk?
[35:15.820 --> 35:22.820]  And Goldfinger says, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[35:24.820 --> 35:34.820]  So you globalist get on the side of the mojo where you get to kill the unborn babies and kill them after they're born and brainwash our kids and poison them.
[35:35.820 --> 35:38.820]  It's all coming back on you a thousand fold.
[35:38.820 --> 35:43.820]  You know, vengeance is God's.
[35:46.820 --> 35:52.820]  Vengeance is God's, but God has instruments of vengeance.
[35:53.820 --> 35:55.820]  That's always the twist to the riddle.
[35:57.820 --> 36:00.820]  And so the globalists expect to try to terrorize us.
[36:01.820 --> 36:02.820]  We're not one of these poor kids.
[36:02.820 --> 36:04.820]  You got strung up one of your dungeons.
[36:04.820 --> 36:14.820]  We're going to terrorize you because you deserve what you've done to these children to be done to you.
[36:17.820 --> 36:18.820]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[36:20.820 --> 36:21.820]  But we're hunting you.
[36:22.820 --> 36:23.820]  You're not hunting us.
[36:23.820 --> 36:24.820]  We're coming for you.
[36:26.820 --> 36:27.820]  We're looking for you.
[36:29.820 --> 36:30.820]  We're hunting you.
[36:30.820 --> 36:33.820]  We're hunting you. We're seeking you.
[36:35.820 --> 36:37.820]  I think you figure that out now, haven't you?
[36:38.820 --> 36:39.820]  All your threats and all your crap.
[36:50.820 --> 36:51.820]  It's hilarious.
[36:56.820 --> 36:58.820]  You're going to pay for what you've done to the children.
[36:58.820 --> 37:05.820]  Just like our God, our king, our master, our director, Jesus Christ said,
[37:07.820 --> 37:11.820]  it's better for you to hurt one of these children than the time big ass millstone around your neck
[37:11.820 --> 37:13.820]  and throw yourself in the deepest part of the ocean.
[37:14.820 --> 37:15.820]  But I'm digressing.
[37:15.820 --> 37:17.820]  I have a lot of other news to hit and I'm getting angry.
[37:19.820 --> 37:21.820]  And they're about to arrest Assange, which is a big screw up.
[37:21.820 --> 37:22.820]  The guy's a hero.
[37:22.820 --> 37:24.820]  He helped get Trump elected.
[37:24.820 --> 37:27.820]  And this is a real betrayal if Trump lets this happen.
[37:27.820 --> 37:31.820]  Maybe Trump's got some plan to get him back here and then get the charges dropped or whatever.
[37:31.820 --> 37:34.820]  But he didn't release stuff that hurt the United States.
[37:34.820 --> 37:37.820]  He released stuff that exposed the criminal deep state that's out of control,
[37:37.820 --> 37:39.820]  working with the Chai comms and others.
[37:39.820 --> 37:45.820]  And breaking a high level source within the Ecuadorian state has told WikiLeaks,
[37:45.820 --> 37:46.820]  this is from the WikiLeaks Twitter,
[37:46.820 --> 37:54.820]  that Julian Assange will be expelled within hours today using the hashtag INAPapers,
[37:54.820 --> 37:57.820]  offshore scandal as a pretext,
[37:57.820 --> 38:01.820]  and that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.
[38:04.820 --> 38:06.820]  And then I guess he'll be taken to the United States.
[38:08.820 --> 38:18.820]  That will be a gigantic black mark on Trump if Julian Assange is not exonerated because
[38:18.820 --> 38:25.820]  the president said, I don't care who's got the files,
[38:25.820 --> 38:30.820]  I don't care if it's WikiLeaks, I don't care if it's the Russians, I don't care who it is, release them.
[38:30.820 --> 38:32.820]  Well, guess what, Mr. President?
[38:32.820 --> 38:35.820]  He did what you told him to do.
[38:35.820 --> 38:37.820]  So don't hang him out to dry.
[38:42.820 --> 38:43.820]  It's that simple.
[38:43.820 --> 38:47.820]  You can't do it.
[38:47.820 --> 38:53.820]  Now, I've seen some of Trump's lawyers arguing court that Assange did nothing wrong in other cases,
[38:53.820 --> 38:57.820]  and I think Trump has a way of making it look one way and then another thing happens,
[38:57.820 --> 39:01.820]  and he tends to take care of people that have done the right thing and have been loyal.
[39:01.820 --> 39:06.820]  But I get what the intelligence agencies are telling Trump, if you do this,
[39:06.820 --> 39:09.820]  everybody will start leaking and then our national security is shot.
[39:09.820 --> 39:12.820]  It doesn't matter if the guy meant, well, he's got to be burned,
[39:12.820 --> 39:15.820]  at least for a few years in present.
[39:15.820 --> 39:18.820]  They didn't release stuff that hurt the national security.
[39:18.820 --> 39:23.820]  Everything WikiLeaks has done is stuff that whistleblowers gave them that needed to come out,
[39:23.820 --> 39:28.820]  and the whistleblower capacity under Obama was being crapped on.
[39:28.820 --> 39:34.820]  They were persecuting the press and whistleblowers at a level more than all presidents combined.
[39:34.820 --> 39:38.820]  Even liberal law professors like Jonathan Turley would state that.
[39:38.820 --> 39:43.820]  And so Assange was a necessary counterbalance to that.
[39:43.820 --> 39:48.820]  I mean, I agree, we don't want to release the blueprints of space planes or particle beams
[39:48.820 --> 39:52.820]  or U.S. assets inside China or the Europe.
[39:52.820 --> 39:58.820]  Interpol is infiltrated by Chai comms. They just arrested the head of it.
[39:58.820 --> 40:03.820]  You've got all this stuff going on, and you've got the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[40:03.820 --> 40:07.820]  Every agent and their assets name and where they live and everything.
[40:07.820 --> 40:09.820]  So I don't want to hear it.
[40:09.820 --> 40:12.820]  Obama made a deal with China and transferred that to him,
[40:12.820 --> 40:16.820]  and we wouldn't have any chance of saving this country right now if Assange and others
[40:16.820 --> 40:18.820]  hadn't been conduits for the patriots in our government.
[40:18.820 --> 40:21.820]  It wasn't the Russians leaked the stuff.
[40:21.820 --> 40:26.820]  Okay, it was people associated with blackwater type companies,
[40:26.820 --> 40:29.820]  and it was people inside the agencies, people like Snowden.
[40:29.820 --> 40:31.820]  It was not the Russians.
[40:31.820 --> 40:37.820]  Okay, the Russians have got fast rockets and people that'll fight and all the rest of it and a lot of resources.
[40:37.820 --> 40:48.820]  We run circles around the Russians when it comes to all the technology and the intercepts and just all of it.
[40:48.820 --> 40:54.820]  And the Russians are the scapegoat to say, oh, we can't release people that have done whiskey leashes.
[40:54.820 --> 40:57.820]  They're Russian agents. It's BS.
[40:57.820 --> 41:03.820]  Julian Assange isn't a Russian agent. Any more than I am. It's just a made up thing they throw out there.
[41:03.820 --> 41:09.820]  So Senator Blumenthal and Senator Murphy run their little cabal up there in Connecticut
[41:09.820 --> 41:13.820]  and point their finger at people and say, oh, Alex Jones, he's off the air.
[41:13.820 --> 41:15.820]  You know, he's a Russian asset.
[41:15.820 --> 41:19.820]  No, I'm an American and you're scumbags.
[41:19.820 --> 41:21.820]  All right, I didn't get to the Cardinal.
[41:21.820 --> 41:25.820]  Warren's West will disappear because of mass migration. I've got to get to that.
[41:25.820 --> 41:28.820]  And a lot of other really key things dealing with the Mueller report.
[41:28.820 --> 41:33.820]  I agree with Rand Paul. Don't release that until we get all the dirt on Clinton, Comey and Brennan.
[41:33.820 --> 41:40.820]  Don't give us all released the report when all these other reports are suppressed. Release it all. How about that?
[41:40.820 --> 41:43.820]  Put the shoe on the other foot. Nothing to hide the shoe in the Mueller report.
[41:43.820 --> 41:47.820]  But the point is you want everything released, but we'll release all the stuff on you.
[41:47.820 --> 41:50.820]  So that's all coming up as well.
[41:50.820 --> 41:59.820]  And then I've got Beto, Beto saying, oh, yes, all white people must pay reparations to black people.
[41:59.820 --> 42:01.820]  And I mean, that is such a fraud on its face.
[42:01.820 --> 42:06.820]  Most white people, ancestors came here after the Civil War.
[42:06.820 --> 42:09.820]  And then most people live in the North in the Civil War.
[42:09.820 --> 42:14.820]  There was three times population in the North, so they weren't involved in slavery.
[42:14.820 --> 42:23.820]  So about 70% of people that live here came after the Civil War, after 1866, 1867.
[42:23.820 --> 42:25.820]  So that's almost 70%.
[42:25.820 --> 42:33.820]  Then more than two-thirds lived in the North and that had nothing to do with slavery.
[42:33.820 --> 42:36.820]  And then of the South, 2% had slaves.
[42:36.820 --> 42:43.820]  So we're talking about a tiny group of white people whose descendants would be connected to slavery.
[42:43.820 --> 42:47.820]  I mean, my friend just had another great baby boy the other day.
[42:47.820 --> 42:54.820]  I was looking at photos and I was thinking, Beto is saying this newborn baby is guilty and has to pay black people money.
[42:54.820 --> 43:17.820]  That is so sick and evil.
[43:25.820 --> 43:27.820]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[43:27.820 --> 43:28.820]  Be sure and sign up for auto-ship.

[47:24.820 --> 47:50.820]  Broadcasting live, coming to you from Austin, Texas, I'm Alex Jones.
[47:50.820 --> 47:56.820]  All right, let me do this. I tend to see articles all the time in the news
[47:56.820 --> 48:00.820]  and then I've got to dig into them because I know they're covering up that it's Islamic.
[48:00.820 --> 48:06.820]  And I saw several examples of that just in the stacks of news that the crew printed for me.
[48:06.820 --> 48:10.820]  Because I surf around and look at everybody's Twitter and check all the mainstream corporate sites
[48:10.820 --> 48:14.820]  and then check redreport.com and I check infowars.com and newswars.com
[48:14.820 --> 48:24.820]  and the other sites out there like summit.news that Paul's launched that's excellent.
[48:24.820 --> 48:29.820]  That's a whole other issue I'll tell you about in a minute.
[48:29.820 --> 48:34.820]  I just always hear in the West how bad men are, how bad Western men are,
[48:34.820 --> 48:40.820]  how virtuous men from other countries are from Africa and India and the Middle East and Asia
[48:40.820 --> 48:45.820]  and just how bad the West is, will you see it and hear it everywhere?
[48:45.820 --> 48:52.820]  And anyone that has any cursory knowledge or history knows that that's completely upside down world.
[48:52.820 --> 49:04.820]  But I saw articles about how Facebook is being used all over from Libya to Nigeria to traffic women
[49:04.820 --> 49:10.820]  into sex slavery and child brides and of course that's the Islamic culture.
[49:10.820 --> 49:13.820]  That's the Orthodox culture.
[49:13.820 --> 49:17.820]  Muhammad was there in Medina and Mecca, the crossroads of the caravans
[49:17.820 --> 49:24.820]  where there was sex slavery and people sold into slavery and that's what he did and he married his 9 year old cousin.
[49:24.820 --> 49:30.820]  And so we all get shocked in Germany and England and the US with the sexual immunization of little girls
[49:30.820 --> 49:36.820]  where the dad takes his 6 year old and uses a pair of scissors to cut her female genitals off
[49:36.820 --> 49:41.820]  and the left just fights to cover that up.
[49:41.820 --> 49:47.820]  And so now Facebook's been sued for reportedly enabling human trafficking.
[49:47.820 --> 49:50.820]  AP's reporting that as well.
[49:50.820 --> 49:52.820]  So pull back from that.
[49:52.820 --> 49:58.820]  You read these whole articles and it'll never say Muslims.
[49:58.820 --> 50:06.820]  Can you imagine a country that was 99% Christian?
[50:06.820 --> 50:12.820]  Like Libya is Muslim and then sex slavery comes back when Qaddafi's thrown out
[50:12.820 --> 50:18.820]  and this is all going on and then you never say it's Islam.
[50:18.820 --> 50:20.820]  Everybody's heard of a harem.
[50:20.820 --> 50:22.820]  What do you think a harem is?
[50:22.820 --> 50:30.820]  It's a big walled cage inside a sultan's palace where he's got a bunch of women he bought.
[50:30.820 --> 50:31.820]  He has sex with.
[50:31.820 --> 50:35.820]  He's got maybe 50, 60, 70 kids.
[50:35.820 --> 50:41.820]  And then he'll choose out of any of them that he might want to make one a general
[50:41.820 --> 50:44.820]  or he might want to execute one or he might want to sell a bunch of them.
[50:44.820 --> 50:46.820]  He doesn't like them as slaves.
[50:46.820 --> 50:53.820]  He's got a farm of women.
[50:53.820 --> 50:56.820]  That's Islam.
[50:56.820 --> 51:01.820]  Like the Islamic television shows how to beat your wife.
[51:01.820 --> 51:08.820]  And all I'm saying is why do I have to hear how I'm bad because I'm a white western man
[51:08.820 --> 51:13.820]  and how much I suck when we're the regions of the world that stopped this crap
[51:13.820 --> 51:15.820]  and think it's wrong.
[51:15.820 --> 51:22.820]  And then a bunch of weird, crazy, leftist, America-hating, swag-jawed, mainly white women.
[51:22.820 --> 51:23.820]  Freak out.
[51:23.820 --> 51:24.820]  Paul Watson wrote about it yesterday.
[51:24.820 --> 51:25.820]  It's up on enforce.com.
[51:25.820 --> 51:26.820]  He just pulled it up.
[51:26.820 --> 51:28.820]  I forgot to cover it.
[51:28.820 --> 51:33.820]  This sociologist that's in women's empowerment studies, university professor,
[51:33.820 --> 51:38.820]  she saw a men working sign, just some old 30-year-old sign.
[51:38.820 --> 51:41.820]  They're down in the sewer fixing it.
[51:41.820 --> 51:44.820]  How many women apply for that job?
[51:44.820 --> 51:45.820]  Paul put tweets out.
[51:45.820 --> 51:47.820]  Let's pull Paul's Twitter up.
[51:47.820 --> 51:56.820]  And she stops and takes a photo of herself with the sign and is so upset by how it triggered her.
[51:56.820 --> 52:00.820]  Meanwhile, she doesn't say a word about sex slavery in the Middle East.
[52:00.820 --> 52:05.820]  She doesn't say a word about any of that anywhere.
[52:05.820 --> 52:07.820]  Did you use a search engine?
[52:07.820 --> 52:10.820]  Professor triggered by men working sign.
[52:10.820 --> 52:11.820]  There it is.
[52:11.820 --> 52:17.820]  And if you scroll down, people put out that the joke tweets are extremely voluminous,
[52:17.820 --> 52:24.820]  showing women strutting by in real photos of men working and saying,
[52:24.820 --> 52:29.820]  how dare you work on that electrical pole?
[52:29.820 --> 52:31.820]  How dare you work in that combat zone?
[52:31.820 --> 52:34.820]  How dare you work at 1,000 feet under as an industrial welder,
[52:34.820 --> 52:38.820]  the most dangerous job there is underwater welder?
[52:38.820 --> 52:40.820]  How dare you do all this?
[52:40.820 --> 52:42.820]  You're such a bad man.
[52:42.820 --> 52:47.820]  Sociology professor offended by men working sign gets owned on Twitter.
[52:47.820 --> 52:49.820]  And then you go through the tweets below.
[52:49.820 --> 52:52.820]  So again, just think about that.
[52:52.820 --> 52:55.820]  You've got mass slavery going on.
[52:55.820 --> 52:57.820]  Stacks of news.
[52:57.820 --> 53:00.820]  I remember Colbert like two years ago made fun of me.
[53:00.820 --> 53:04.820]  And I said, Hillary doesn't say a word about women's rights in Libya.
[53:04.820 --> 53:05.820]  She helped destroy.
[53:05.820 --> 53:10.820]  They're selling women on slave blocks in Tripoli and Benghazi every day.
[53:10.820 --> 53:15.820]  And they made the joke.
[53:15.820 --> 53:20.820]  What's a slave block?
[53:20.820 --> 53:24.820]  What's a slave block?
[53:24.820 --> 53:27.820]  Well, that's the classic term going back thousands of years ago,
[53:27.820 --> 53:29.820]  where you've got an auction block.
[53:29.820 --> 53:34.820]  The term auction block, it's a raised stage where the goods are shown.
[53:34.820 --> 53:39.820]  And the term auction block comes from slavery and biblical times in Egypt.
[53:39.820 --> 53:42.820]  It was called the auction block.
[53:42.820 --> 53:48.820]  Things don't change.
[53:48.820 --> 53:50.820]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:50.820 --> 53:54.820]  The one refuge men have got is hard, dangerous jobs,
[53:54.820 --> 53:57.820]  pouring concrete, digging holes, running jackhammers.
[53:57.820 --> 53:58.820]  Let me tell you something.
[53:58.820 --> 54:01.820]  I've done some construction work.
[54:01.820 --> 54:04.820]  Because my dad and mom wanted me to have different jobs,
[54:04.820 --> 54:06.820]  obviously during high school and some of college.
[54:06.820 --> 54:08.820]  And I went out and tried my hand.
[54:08.820 --> 54:12.820]  I'm like, I can get $25 an hour in construction.
[54:12.820 --> 54:13.820]  Yeah.
[54:13.820 --> 54:14.820]  Well, you're a big guy.
[54:14.820 --> 54:16.820]  Can you run this jackhammer for 12 hours?
[54:16.820 --> 54:19.820]  And I had just, I lift weights.
[54:19.820 --> 54:20.820]  I was in great shape.
[54:20.820 --> 54:21.820]  I had calisthenics weights.
[54:21.820 --> 54:23.820]  I was bleeding everywhere, even through the gloves.
[54:23.820 --> 54:25.820]  And it was like 12 hours in.
[54:25.820 --> 54:26.820]  I said, listen, I'm tired.
[54:26.820 --> 54:27.820]  What are you a wimp?
[54:27.820 --> 54:28.820]  You can't.
[54:28.820 --> 54:30.820]  People are real nice when they hired me.
[54:30.820 --> 54:31.820]  He's a wimp.
[54:31.820 --> 54:32.820]  He can't run that jackhammer.
[54:32.820 --> 54:34.820]  And they were just seeing what I could do.
[54:34.820 --> 54:38.820]  I kept the job about a month and said, hey, let me tell you,
[54:38.820 --> 54:41.820]  a little too manly for me.
[54:41.820 --> 54:44.820]  Running jackhammers is hell.
[54:44.820 --> 54:48.820]  They rattle your teeth out of socket.
[54:48.820 --> 54:50.820]  But see, that's this whole world.
[54:50.820 --> 54:53.820]  How dare you run a jackhammer or climb down in that sewage?
[54:53.820 --> 54:56.820]  Or how dare you be a plumber that goes unclogged people's
[54:56.820 --> 55:00.820]  toilets all day with all the tampons and feces coming up in your face.
[55:00.820 --> 55:05.820]  You're a dirty man, you piece of crap.
[55:05.820 --> 55:10.820]  Oh, but you don't hear a stinking fat word out of these
[55:10.820 --> 55:13.820]  feminist America hating, man hating monsters who are
[55:13.820 --> 55:16.820]  sabotaging our country when we have all this.
[55:16.820 --> 55:20.820]  AP, UN, women, migrants in Libya often face gang rape,
[55:20.820 --> 55:22.820]  abuse, slavery.
[55:22.820 --> 55:25.820]  Migrants captured in Libya say they end up sold as slaves.
[55:25.820 --> 55:27.820]  Including men.
[55:27.820 --> 55:31.820]  Women mostly at risk from traffickers in India and Libya.
[55:31.820 --> 55:34.820]  Oh, guess who runs the female trafficking in India?
[55:34.820 --> 55:36.820]  Oh, the little religion of peace people.
[55:36.820 --> 55:39.820]  Child bribes in Africa are advertised on Facebook
[55:39.820 --> 55:41.820]  and sold to men.
[55:41.820 --> 55:44.820]  Daily Beast doesn't tell you it's Muslims.
[55:44.820 --> 55:47.820]  As a Rotterham grooming gang survivor,
[55:47.820 --> 55:49.820]  I want people to know about the religious extremism
[55:49.820 --> 55:53.820]  which inspired my abusers, the independent Muslims,
[55:53.820 --> 55:57.820]  sex slavery, kidnapping, number of child sex abuse victims
[55:57.820 --> 56:01.820]  in Rotterham, that's one town, raise you 1,510
[56:01.820 --> 56:05.820]  because nobody'd say a damn word just like drag time story
[56:05.820 --> 56:08.820]  when convicted pedophiles come and have your kid bounce on their
[56:08.820 --> 56:10.820]  knee at the public school or wherever and you don't get told
[56:10.820 --> 56:13.820]  because it wouldn't be nice to run their background.
[56:13.820 --> 56:16.820]  After all, there weren't a damn disguise.
[56:16.820 --> 56:18.820]  You understand?
[56:18.820 --> 56:21.820]  So next time some leftist pig gets in your face and tells you
[56:21.820 --> 56:25.820]  how bad America sucks, get back in their face and let them know
[56:25.820 --> 56:28.820]  because they've been set up and prepared at these universities
[56:28.820 --> 56:32.820]  to bring this country down and they make me sick.
[56:32.820 --> 56:36.820]  We've got a special guest who helped expose the second
[56:36.820 --> 56:39.820]  convicted child rapist, this guy raped a six-year-old boy.
[56:39.820 --> 56:42.820]  The other guy was convicted, raped a six-year-old boy as well.
[56:42.820 --> 56:45.820]  They're all part of the same team that dressed up in disguises
[56:45.820 --> 56:48.820]  and then go have their time with your children.
[56:48.820 --> 56:51.820]  You're going to see shocking footage, ladies and gentlemen,
[56:51.820 --> 56:55.820]  if you're actually grooming small children and giving them roses.
[56:55.820 --> 56:58.820]  Yes, red roses.
[56:58.820 --> 57:01.820]  Perhaps a box of candy.
[57:01.820 --> 57:03.820]  I have candy in the van.
[57:03.820 --> 57:05.820]  I have puppies.
[57:05.820 --> 57:09.820]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:09.820 --> 57:12.820]  Children brought into men's dresses, satanic clowns going
[57:12.820 --> 57:19.820]  around your kids.
[57:19.820 --> 57:22.820]  So this is all the liberalism.

[57:44.820 --> 57:48.820]  Stay with us.
[57:48.820 --> 57:51.820]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[57:51.820 --> 57:53.820]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[57:53.820 --> 57:56.820]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[57:56.820 --> 57:59.820]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[57:59.820 --> 58:01.820]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it,
[58:01.820 --> 58:03.820]  trying to shut it down.
[58:03.820 --> 58:05.820]  I didn't invent all this.
[58:05.820 --> 58:07.820]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana,
[58:07.820 --> 58:09.820]  and what really works for humanity.
[58:09.820 --> 58:11.820]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[58:11.820 --> 58:13.820]  And lo and behold, it's super popular,
[58:13.820 --> 58:15.820]  like it's always been.
[58:15.820 --> 58:17.820]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down
[58:17.820 --> 58:20.820]  so desperately, because we have the light
[58:20.820 --> 58:23.820]  in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.
[58:23.820 --> 58:25.820]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself
[58:25.820 --> 58:27.820]  and Infowars by buying the great products
[58:27.820 --> 58:30.820]  at InfowarsStore.com, by spreading the articles,
[58:30.820 --> 58:33.820]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation,
[58:33.820 --> 58:35.820]  and for praying for this nation and the world
[58:35.820 --> 58:37.820]  for peace and discernment.
[58:37.820 --> 58:39.820]  I want to thank myself and the whole Infowars family.
[58:39.820 --> 58:41.820]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done,
[58:41.820 --> 58:44.820]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[58:44.820 --> 59:13.820]  You are the Infowars, and I salute you.

[59:16.820 --> 59:18.820]  and I want you to have storeable food,
[59:18.820 --> 59:20.820]  so it's a total win-win.

[59:22.820 --> 59:24.820]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[59:24.820 --> 59:26.820]  On Infowars, select storeable foods.
[59:26.820 --> 59:28.820]  They've got special diet foods.
[59:28.820 --> 59:30.820]  They've got three-month supplies, your supplies,
[59:30.820 --> 59:32.820]  weak emergency supplies.
[59:32.820 --> 59:34.820]  They've got so many great products there.
[59:34.820 --> 59:36.820]  They've got a three-year supply.
[59:36.820 --> 59:38.820]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[59:38.820 --> 59:40.820]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[59:40.820 --> 59:42.820]  You're buying war bonds, bringing you great products,
[59:42.820 --> 59:44.820]  health, we are unstoppable.
[59:44.820 --> 59:46.820]  InfowarsStore.com.
[59:46.820 --> 59:48.820]  Infowars, select high-quality storeable foods,
[59:48.820 --> 59:50.820]  powered by my Patriot supply.
[59:52.820 --> 59:58.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:04.820]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:08.820]  if there was a army of financed pedophiles
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.820]  and their supporters dressing as clowns
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.820]  and disguise themselves,
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:14.820]  they'd give them access to children as young as three
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.820]  convicted pedophiles.
[01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.820]  Would you want to know about it?
[01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.820]  Would you want to stand up against it?
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.820]  Or would you be like local Houston news
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.820]  that laughed and said,
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.820]  got to get them while they're young?
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.820]  A lot of folks are joining the globalist team right now.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.820]  A lot of people are showing the world
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.820]  they're willing to do whatever it takes
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.820]  for their father Lucifer to give them power.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.820]  But we're not going to go along with that,
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.820]  and so we're going inside
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:40.820]  the real it.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.820]  The real gang of sickos
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.820]  dresses clowns targeting your children
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:46.820]  in every county, every city of the United States.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.820]  Their forces are rising.
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.820]  We're facing a major offensive by them.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.820]  We'll talk to a brave woman
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.820]  and others who've exposed not one, but two
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.820]  in one nest of child predators
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.820]  in Houston on the other side.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.820]  But first, here's Mark Dyson.
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.820]  Looks like I got a new fan, you guys.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.820]  But before I show you who it is,
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.820]  I'm pretty sure you'll be able to tell
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.820]  from hearing her trademark laugh.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.820]  She posted a brief clip of one of my videos
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.820]  on her YouTube channel,
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.820]  and you can hear her in the background
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.820]  and it sounds like she really likes me.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.820]  ABC News, citing sources
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.820]  familiar with the investigation
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.820]  reporting that no more indictments
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.820]  are coming from the special county.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.820]  Ah-ah!
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.820]  I have to do it more then.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.820]  Yep, that's the one and only,
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.820]  Roseanne Barr. Thanks for the shout out, Roseanne.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.820]  As you know, YouTube's one of the only places
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.820]  you can do comedy these days,
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.820]  since it's obviously not allowed
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.820]  on the big networks anymore.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.820]  Someone else who has a great sense of humor
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.820]  is the one and only, President Trump,
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.820]  who on Thursday posted this video
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:48.820]  on his Twitter account,
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.820]  which was created by the great Carpe Dantum,
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.820]  who took Creepy Joe Biden's
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.820]  apology video and
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.820]  well, added a little something.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.820]  I say, kids, I help people.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.820]  I grab men and move them by the shoulders
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.820]  and say, you can do this.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.820]  And, uh, women
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.820]  and men move home.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.820]  It's the way I've always been.
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.820]  It's the way I try to show I care about them when I listen.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.820]  Not everybody thought it was funny, though,
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.820]  because, of course, liberals don't have a sense of humor.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.820]  The Daily Beast reported that
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.820]  Trump tweeted out a doctored video.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.820]  It was doctored.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.820]  I'm sorry, but the verb doctored
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.820]  means, quote,
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.820]  to change the content or appearance
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.820]  of in order to deceive
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.820]  or falsify.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.820]  This video is fake.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.820]  Me, Master Carpe Dantum, must have taken
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.820]  the original Joe Biden video
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.820]  and edited it.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.820]  Business Insider said that it was
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.820]  a ridiculously edited video.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.820]  The doctored video appears
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.820]  to have been originally posted
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.820]  by the conservative account Carpe Dantum.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.820]  How dare you post doctored videos, Carpe?
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.820]  And I used to think that you were cool.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.820]  Looks like Donald Trump Jr.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.820]  tweeted it out as well, so
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.820]  Newsweek Magazine is calling him out for
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.820]  sharing the doctored video.
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.820]  It's called a meme, morons,
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.820]  and it's hilarious.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.820]  Having no clue about internet culture
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.820]  and not understanding that you should never feed a troll
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.820]  by responding to them,
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.820]  Joe Biden, of course, responded
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.820]  quotes tweeting President Trump's tweet
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.820]  and saying,
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.820]  I see that you are on the job
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.820]  and presidential as always.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.820]  The Joe Biden memes are the best thing
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.820]  happening on the internet right now.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.820]  And one of the greatest ones is that famous picture
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.820]  of him smiling and walking away
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.820]  from some crazy protesters
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.820]  while adjusting his tie
[01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.820]  and somebody inserted Joe Biden
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.820]  into the background.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:38.820]  Somebody even took a still image of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.820]  his live stream the other night
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.820]  when she was putting together Ikea furniture
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.820]  in her empty apartment
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.820]  and inserted Joe Biden into that.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.820]  There's even a Jesse Smollett Joe Biden
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.820]  meme that's captioned
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.820]  he smelled my hair and whispered
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.820]  this is Biden country.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.820]  Somebody even made up these Biden 2020
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.820]  t-shirts.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.820]  But liberals are always trying to ruin our fun.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.820]  YouTube demonetized my video from Tuesday
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.820]  saying it must have been an April Fool's joke
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.820]  when Time Magazine put
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.820]  Alexandria Calford-Cortez
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.820]  on the cover.
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:12.820]  After the Thought Police manually reviewed it
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.820]  they confirmed that it was
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.820]  non-advertiser friendly.
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.820]  Apparently you're not allowed to make fun of her royal highness.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.820]  The video I did about her socialism
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.820]  stupidly spreading and other Democrats
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.820]  afraid to say that they were capitalists
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.820]  that had to get submitted for a
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.820]  manual review.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.820]  Even the one titled Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.820]  Rocket Scientist got demonetized
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.820]  as soon as they uploaded
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.820]  and had to be submitted for a
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:38.820]  manual review.
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:40.820]  With Mark Dice
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.820]  I'm Alex Jones coming up
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.820]  inside the cult
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.820]  of men disguising themselves as clowns
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.820]  and then being given access
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.820]  by public schools, elementary schools, libraries
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.820]  to your children, convicted child rapists
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.820]  dressed as clowns
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:05:22.820]  who are attacking their in your city.
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.820]  With
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.820]  poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.820]  it's more important than ever
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.820]  to support your body in the fight against stress.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.820]  With powerful ingredients
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.820]  combined to help support the mind
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.820]  and body, Happys
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.820]  helps support during stress

[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:48.820]  Don't live your life bogged down
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.820]  help your body overcome the effects
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.820]  of daily stress and pressure today
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.820]  with Happys from InfowarsStore.com

[01:06:54.820 --> 01:07:04.820]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, welcome back!
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.820]  I am collecting more evidence
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.820]  more research
[01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.820]  more documentation for you
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:12.820]  and really getting ready.
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.820]  That's why I was about a minute late getting back on air.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.820]  So we're going to have our guest on
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.820]  for the next three segments, the last 45 minutes of the hour
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.820]  when we go to break here in about nine minutes.
[01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:22.820]  Because I want to line up all the names
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.820]  all the people, all the preparation
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.820]  because this is so big
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:28.820]  this is so serious, this is so crazy.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.820]  I mean I'm ready to launch into this right now
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.820]  but I want to give you the big picture
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.820]  and I want to break down every facet
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.820]  and every angle of this for you
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.820]  on the other side of this segment.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.820]  So I was just running in here getting these clips ready
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.820]  I've been getting ready before the show today
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.820]  with all this information still working on it
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.820]  to try to present it
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.820]  as hardcore
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:54.820]  but as judicious as I can.
[01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:56.820]  There are groups of men
[01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:58.820]  not just here but in Europe
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:00.820]  who are all part of the same club
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.820]  it's the exact same formula
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:04.820]  they say the same things, they do the same things
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.820]  dressed as demonic clowns
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.820]  calling themselves drag queens
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.820]  being given access to your children
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.820]  and a second one in the same town
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.820]  in the same operation
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.820]  was just busted yesterday
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.820]  because of a six-year-old boy.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.820]  Now of course
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.820]  I began to notice that the so-called drag queens
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.820]  at their own events
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:26.820]  don't dress as a demon outfit, it's with the kids
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.820]  because they enjoy the fear of the children
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:30.820]  and the parents and teachers shoving them
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.820]  into their arms, it's a very demonic exercise
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.820]  but it's because they have to have
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.820]  aliases because many of them
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.820]  have criminal records.
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.820]  This is a massive
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.820]  organized plan
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.820]  so we're going to get
[01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.820]  our old duckies
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.820]  in a row
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.820]  and we're going to come back
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.820]  and we're going to present this, the children are worth it
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.820]  they're worth
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.820]  us exposing this
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.820]  and they're worth you getting the article
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.820]  that's on infowars.com
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.820]  and later when we post this report as a video
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:04.820]  to infowars.com they are worth
[01:09:04.820 --> 01:09:06.820]  you taking the time to get this article
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.820]  out, bombshell.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.820]  Another drag queen story hour member
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.820]  exposed as a
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:14.820]  pedophile investigation shows
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.820]  now there you can see him
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.820]  in his normal female outfit
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.820]  but we probably need to change that photo
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.820]  out from his own Facebook when he's in the demon
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.820]  outfit
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.820]  and so in fact let me just do that, document can please
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:28.820]  I'm going to go ahead and show you this
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.820]  this is the individual, the convicted pedophile
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:32.820]  that will tell you his name and everything
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.820]  in his vampire
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.820]  demon outfit
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:38.820]  hello children
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.820]  oh no big deal
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:42.820]  we're seeing this, radio listeners are lucky not to
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.820]  and then here is the actual outfit worn with children
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:46.820]  and the mouth is always open
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.820]  like he's auditioning for a vampire movie
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.820]  and
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.820]  so it's always the same style, the same deal
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:54.820]  the children recoil and fear
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.820]  but local news shesh hey
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.820]  they'll get used to it
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.820]  it's for their own good
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.820]  gotta get them while they're young
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.820]  so again
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.820]  ladies and gentlemen this is not a joke
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.820]  you always hear these big viral stories about a kid saw a clown
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:10.820]  in the woods
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:12.820]  and the whole town's afraid
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:14.820]  but if a bunch of demon clowns show up at your school
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.820]  and kids sit on their laps
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:18.820]  in some cases like Colorado and New York
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.820]  they don't tell the parents they're coming
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.820]  and they tell them you're going to be one of us
[01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.820]  forever
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.820]  you're coming with us
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.820]  to a nice place
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.820]  convicted child rapist
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.820]  rapist 6 year old boy
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.820]  convicted child rapist, rapist 6 year old boy
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:36.820]  people on screen and they've got
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.820]  your children and the school
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.820]  and all the people act really
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.820]  excited and real weird like a big
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.820]  naughty things happening
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:46.820]  because there's a lot of people in on this
[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.820]  the energy
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.820]  of children is sacred
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:52.820]  and those that are willing to extract it
[01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.820]  the vampire priest
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.820]  are very important
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.820]  and since the ancient days of Greece
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.820]  sometimes they would have this madness
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.820]  afflicted town in Greece
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.820]  in the different areas, different kingdoms
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.820]  and they would have actually vampire hunting
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.820]  and they would actually
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.820]  go out into the ruins of old cities
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.820]  of the woods and find the mentally ill people
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.820]  that were possessed who thought they were vampires
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:16.820]  and kill them
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.820]  this is in history books because
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.820]  they would sneak in at night and grab their kids
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.820]  and try to drink their blood
[01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.820]  and so it just happens over and over again
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.820]  that this mass psychosis happens
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.820]  and the vampire always acts effeminate too
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.820]  it's a thing it does
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.820]  it's like oh I'm liberal
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.820]  oh let me take care of you
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.820]  and again we've studied them
[01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:38.820]  you have to understand who they are
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:40.820]  and that's where we are
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.820]  now I'm telling the story about Greece
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.820]  and what they did I'm not saying that's a good thing now
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.820]  but I just said they should not
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.820]  be given access to children
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.820]  if you see a man in a clown outfit with their mouth open
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.820]  like a moray eel going ehh
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.820]  but sometimes they actually around you will go ehh
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.820]  we've gone and covered their events
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.820]  in front of the kids they go oh now you're just swinging
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:00.820]  and they go ehh oh ehh
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:02.820]  whatever it is possessing them
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.820]  whatever corner of deep space
[01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.820]  or another dimension just has a
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.820]  craved desire
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.820]  a fiendish desire to get
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.820]  their hands on your children
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.820]  so I'll get
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.820]  focused and go to the presentation
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:18.820]  on the other side of this break
[01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.820]  also
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.820]  we will after our
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.820]  guest leaves us open the phones up
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.820]  Vatican Cardinal Warrens
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.820]  West will disappear because of mass migration
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.820]  every Catholic you know should see this
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.820]  this guy's made a bold move
[01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.820]  Vatican Cardinal Robert Sarah
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:36.820]  says the West will disappear
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.820]  says the Vatican is trying to sell out the West
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.820]  and it's very dangerous this guy's very bold
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.820]  a real leader very very excited
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.820]  like Paul Watson said
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.820]  this guy becomes the next pope
[01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.820]  he'll convert to Catholicism
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.820]  I guess this guy is like an old fashioned Catholic
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.820]  who isn't suicidal
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.820]  so we'll be talking about that as well
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.820]  one big thing I want to tell everybody about
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.820]  and that's DNA force
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.820]  I remember researching
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.820]  five years ago
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:06.820]  what the most highly rated most successful
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.820]  most profitable
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.820]  supplements
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.820]  out there were
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:14.820]  what people love what work great and what people buy
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.820]  so we can fund our operation while helping people at the same time
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.820]  a 360 win so you like it
[01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.820]  it works good you come back
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.820]  it's a good relationship
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.820]  a win-win a Christian relationship
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.820]  do unto others as you have them do unto you
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.820]  a win-win
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:30.820]  a 360 win and so I looked into
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.820]  telomeres slowing
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.820]  their decline
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.820]  which is the same as actually extending
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.820]  their life that's in the DNA
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.820]  that's what makes you age
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.820]  the PQQ the CoQ10
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.820]  all of it that most of it wasn't organic
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.820]  out there but it was still overpriced
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:48.820]  to get the organic derived types that are certified
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.820]  is more expensive this is very very hard
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.820]  to make
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:54.820]  and so we developed DNA force
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.820]  now most quality
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.820]  level systems like this
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.820]  people aren't going to buy at their big box store
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.820]  like Whole Foods whatever you've got to get it
[01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.820]  at a medical clinic it's not prescription
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.820]  people aren't ready to pay
[01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:08.820]  300-400 bucks for it
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.820]  because of the research and the markup
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.820]  we just cut out the five to seven times markup
[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.820]  and did a hundred
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.820]  and fifty percent markup
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.820]  then we always have it discounted to about
[01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:20.820]  a hundred percent markup
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:22.820]  it's sixty percent off right now
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:24.820]  so it's right down close to cost
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:26.820]  and it's been sold out for six months
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:28.820]  but I want you to experience
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.820]  this amazing formula
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.820]  at InfoWarsLive.com
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:34.820]  or InfoWarsStore.com
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.820]  I want you to experience
[01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.820]  what it does now it takes a few weeks to kick in just like X2
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.820]  but
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.820]  if you will just simply read
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.820]  the reviews 97 percent
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.820]  positive 4.7
[01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:48.820]  stars
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:50.820]  force plus when you reformulate you always got to change the name
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.820]  so when you see plus it just means
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:54.820]  like brain force or this we made it stronger
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:56.820]  switch down plus
[01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:58.820]  and I signed a bigger contract
[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.820]  to order more for a longer period
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.820]  was able to bring down our cost
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:04.820]  about 50 percent
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.820]  so that's why I've been able to drop it massively
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.820]  at $59 right now
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.820]  this cost thousands of dollars per kilo
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:14.820]  just the PQQ and the CoQ10
[01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.820]  at that price nothing
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.820]  gets within light years of this
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.820]  this is the best
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.820]  system when it comes to telomeres
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.820]  and the mitochondria and antioxidant
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.820]  out there this is to the next level
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.820]  I mean just one of the things in it
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.820]  you got to eat like 40 cartons of blueberries to get the same amount of it
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.820]  the PQQ
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:34.820]  it's just ridiculous
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.820]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:38.820]  InfoWarsLive.com is the sub-site
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.820]  what takes you right to the supplements

[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.820]  The United States of Empire
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.820]  is a book that claims the United States
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.820]  is the empire of the world
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.820]  George Washington had warned us
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.820]  against foreign wars
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.820]  The United States of Empire
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.820]  shows that World Wars I and II
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.820]  left England broken
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.820]  its former colony the U.S.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.820]  had to save the empire
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.820]  was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.820]  The deep state began with World War I
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.820]  The United States of Empire
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.820]  by James Dunn
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.820]  available at Amazon Books
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.820]  Heart disease is on the rise
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:00.820]  clogged arteries, high blood pressure
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.820]  and high cholesterol levels
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.820]  may not be fully detected by you
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.820]  but the symptoms are there
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.820]  loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.820]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:12.820]  are just a few of these
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.820]  that can alert you that something is wrong
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.820]  hear how heart and body extract
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.820]  is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.820]  across America
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.820]  blood pressure has normalized
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.820]  my diabetes has totally improved
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.820]  everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.820]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.820]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.820]  anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:34.820]  should be using this product
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.820]  as a preventative to keep their
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:58.820]  cardiovascular system healthy
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.820]  it's simple, if you want to beat the globalist
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.820]  if you want to take on the new world order
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.820]  I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:06.820]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.820]  I'm not sitting here selling you
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.820]  late term abortion and all the great it is
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.820]  I just go out and say what is the top
[01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.820]  heart pill, what is the top
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.820]  tumor is the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.820]  and what's the best lab in the country
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:20.820]  okay they're the highest rated
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.820]  I'm like you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.820]  well yeah they only put $5 product in the bottle
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:26.820]  but that's still incredible sir
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.820]  I'm like what's the highest you could do
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.820]  a month later, 90-95%
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.820]  no one's ever done that
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.820]  it costs $10 no one's ever done that
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:36.820]  sir, the average to predators
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.820]  3-5% the top brand is 50%
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.820]  I'm like we're going to have 95% curcuminoid
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.820]  I mean you understand like that's
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:44.820]  like our information is explosive
[01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.820]  our fish oil, I go out and I get the cleanest
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.820]  the best, my children take it
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.820]  you think I'm going to give you fish oil
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.820]  that isn't the very damn best on my soul
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.820]  you think I'm going to screw somebody over
[01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:56.820]  like one of these devil worshippers, never
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:02.820]  in infowarsstore.com

[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:32.820]  we're basically selling these at cost
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.820]  because there was a big overhaul
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.820]  go ahead and read the hundreds
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.820]  of 5-star reviews for yourself

[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.820]  once again because the malfeasance
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.820]  of the Mayor Turner
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:32.820]  and the
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.820]  administration of the Houston Public Library
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:36.820]  and their negligence
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:38.820]  in doing background checks
[01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.820]  on volunteers who volunteer
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.820]  to help with drag queen
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.820]  story power
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.820]  at the Houston Public Library
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:48.820]  the master's assistant
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:50.820]  and human rights activist
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.820]  that work with us
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.820]  and community leader text Christopher
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.820]  have been raising their alarm for months
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:58.820]  and asking questions about this program
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.820]  demanding documents to make sure
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.820]  that they had them due diligence
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.820]  we've been denied those documents
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.820]  we still have not got them despite the Attorney General
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.820]  demanding that those were released to us
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.820]  we want to know how many more
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.820]  we want an audit
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:14.820]  of the entire Houston Public Library
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:16.820]  system because now we know
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:18.820]  not just one
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.820]  convicted sex offender
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.820]  from the ups and downs
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.820]  I'm in the middle
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.820]  without any plans
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:30.820]  I'm a boy
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.820]  and I'm a man
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:34.820]  I'm antin
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.820]  and I don't know what I want
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.820]  antin
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.820]  I just don't know what I want
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.820]  antin
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:46.820]  I gotta get away
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.820]  I gotta
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.820]  get out of this place
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.820]  I'll go running
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.820]  in outer space
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.820]  again
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:02.820]  well they went running down to space all right
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.820]  for the rest of the hour we're going to go down
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.820]  a rabbit hole that is sickening
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.820]  that is frightening
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.820]  that is disgusting, that is demonic
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:20.820]  but it must be plumbed
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.820]  because if we don't do this
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.820]  they're going to continue to have access to our children
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:26.820]  not one but two
[01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:28.820]  in the same drag queen story time
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:30.820]  events
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.820]  at public schools, elementary schools
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.820]  libraries
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.820]  in Colorado they don't even ask
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.820]  they bring these kids in the elementary school without even telling the parents
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.820]  two of the ring leaders
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.820]  convicted rapists
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:44.820]  of them of six year old boys
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.820]  drag queen
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.820]  who read the kids at Houston library's convicted pedophile
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.820]  goes by
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.820]  Tatiana
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.820]  Malaninha which means bad girl
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.820]  Alberto Garza
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.820]  32
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.820]  served many years in jail for raping a six year old
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.820]  and aggravated assault
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.820]  and of course
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.820]  uses a alias
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.820]  and dresses as a clown
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.820]  to cover his identity
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.820]  and then they call themselves drag queens
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.820]  now bombshell, another drag queen story
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:18.820]  our member exposed as pedophile
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.820]  investigation show
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.820]  William Travis Dees, good lord
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.820]  operating under four different
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.820]  aliases
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.820]  but they were able to track him down by going
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:30.820]  and
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:32.820]  watching their social media
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.820]  and discover what he was
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:36.820]  really up to, he was convicted
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.820]  of aggravated assault
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:40.820]  six year old boy
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.820]  as well
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:44.820]  Houston mass resistance activists
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.820]  have a drag queen story our victory against huge odds
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.820]  testifying before the city council
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.820]  and joining us is Tracy Shannon
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:52.820]  of massresistance.org
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.820]  massresistance.org
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.820]  you have to understand folks
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:58.820]  they're coordinated
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:00.820]  out of New York is where this all started
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.820]  it's on national TV they're pushing it
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.820]  CNN
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:06.820]  AP is telling you it's great
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:08.820]  news says hey got to get the kids while they're young
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.820]  I'm going to play that clip coming up
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.820]  this is all a sick joke
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.820]  on everyone
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.820]  and so this is literally a gang of
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.820]  pedophiles and pedophile supporters
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.820]  and those that want to sexualize children
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.820]  they admit they're grooming them I'm going to play those videos
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:24.820]  they have the rubber chickens saying come to me
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.820]  my chickens they're handing the kids
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:28.820]  roses
[01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:30.820]  I mean this is sick
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.820]  this is introducing themselves
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.820]  dressed like vampire clowns to children
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.820]  and this wonderful woman
[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.820]  has been involved fighting it
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:40.820]  before we get into all this we play all these clips
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:42.820]  Tracy Shannon what alerted you to this
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.820]  why did you get involved and what do you think
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:46.820]  at the bottom of the spider hole
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:48.820]  that we're dealing with
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:50.820]  well
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:52.820]  how did I get alerted to this I just started
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:54.820]  first I
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.820]  was going to do a friend called
[01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.820]  another woman who's part of massresistance
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.820]  here and said
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:02.820]  they're doing drag queen story hours
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:04.820]  at the library what do you know about this
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.820]  Tracy I said well I didn't know they were doing it
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.820]  locally I thought they had had one
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:10.820]  event locally I didn't know it was a routine
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.820]  deal initially several months ago
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.820]  she was really disturbed she's a grandmother
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.820]  in the community she said can we offer
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.820]  a Bible story time I said hey I'd be
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.820]  willing to do a part of that let's go about
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.820]  doing our applications and so we did
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:24.820]  and she was told
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:26.820]  by
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:28.820]  a communications
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.820]  person there at the library
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:32.820]  no religion is allowed in the library
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.820]  and that excludes all and she went
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.820]  into great detail on the phone to her
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:38.820]  explaining what even is long
[01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:40.820]  can't be allowed
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.820]  Christianity none of those and then
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.820]  I said oh I would love to get that in
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.820]  writing so I applied
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:48.820]  or emailed directly
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.820]  with a beginning
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.820]  application process
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.820]  and said how about a Christianity
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.820]  story time and
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.820]  is that excluded and so she sent me
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.820]  back some boiler plate of all the things
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.820]  that could be included and it did not
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.820]  include Christianity and religion
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.820]  so if it's not included it's excluded
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.820]  so this
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.820]  well that's how the Satanists operate
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:14.820]  they bring everybody else's speech
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:16.820]  out claiming separation in church and state no
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:18.820]  the school or library can't have
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:20.820]  an official religion under the First Amendment
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:22.820]  I agree with that but you can have
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.820]  if students or parents are involved any
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:26.820]  club you want that's why schools
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:28.820]  allow Satanist clubs but not Christian
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.820]  clubs so again they created
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:32.820]  a vacuum so that now you have the
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.820]  pedo club come in
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:36.820]  right and you can have a Christian
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.820]  story time there's nothing
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:40.820]  on that and
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.820]  they're gonna lean on the First Amendment
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.820]  and say that's how they can have
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.820]  a drag queen story hour but that's not
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:48.820]  correct the First Amendment is not there
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.820]  to protect lewdness and
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:52.820]  promotion of sexuality sexual behavior
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:54.820]  and ideas are reflective of adult sexual
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:56.820]  content
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:58.820]  or and promote sexual
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.820]  does it protect a bunch of men dressed
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:02.820]  up like demon clowns most of which
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:04.820]  are sex workers
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.820]  from having access to children
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.820]  that's right that's right that's not
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:10.820]  what it's supposed to be for and we
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.820]  can absolutely have
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:14.820]  in our local levels and I hope people listening
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:16.820]  will start this in your own communities
[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.820]  get your municipality
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:20.820]  to get some
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.820]  language governing what kind of
[01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.820]  programs and content
[01:27:24.820 --> 01:27:26.820]  can be part of children's programming
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.820]  in your libraries it's actually
[01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:30.820]  that is allowable under
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:32.820]  First Amendment and even the American
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:34.820]  Library Association Bill of Rights
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.820]  validates that and
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.820]  that is the way to go now our
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.820]  mayor in Houston isn't willing
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.820]  to do that he says as long as he's mayor
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.820]  there's gonna be a drag queen story
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.820]  time well I want
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.820]  you know a lot of this is blackmail too because
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:50.820]  a lot of these sex workers
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:52.820]  which Mr. D's
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.820]  admits he is
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:56.820]  William Travis D's
[01:27:56.820 --> 01:27:58.820]  get blackmail on the local
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:00.820]  officials and people that's the other way
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:02.820]  they're able to take over but
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.820]  this person looks like a psychotic
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:06.820]  and the video we're gonna play after the break
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:08.820]  is walking around giving children roses
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.820]  while talking about chicken which is a
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:12.820]  public not even code word
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.820]  for underage boys
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:16.820]  so this is just bizarre
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:18.820]  it's gone this far what are they gonna do
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.820]  now when we come back
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:22.820]  that two out of one nest

[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:26.820]  no joke a cult-like gang of men
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:28.820]  disguising themselves as clowns
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:30.820]  are targeting children
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.820]  in
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:34.820]  the US UK and Europe
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:36.820]  that's the emergency report

[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.820]  out of regular dog food
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:28.820]  dinovite is nutrition

[01:29:52.820 --> 01:30:20.820]  dinovite.com
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.820]  and lo and behold it's super popular
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.820]  like it's always been
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:26.820]  that's why the globalists are trying to shut it down
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:28.820]  so desperately because we have
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:30.820]  the light in the dark of the night
[01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:32.820]  that sends chills at my spine
[01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.820]  so whatever you do
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.820]  continue to support yourself and infowars
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.820]  by buying the great products at infowarsstore.com
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:40.820]  by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:42.820]  and by praying for this operation
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:44.820]  and for praying for this nation and the world
[01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:46.820]  for peace and discernment
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.820]  for myself and the whole infowars family
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.820]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:52.820]  because without you
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.820]  infowars is nothing you are the infowars
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:56.820]  and I salute you
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.820]  I want to say brain force is great
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:02.820]  I want to say turbo force is amazing
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.820]  it is but if you took it with fish oil
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:06.820]  it's like the fish oil is it
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.820]  the fish oil is better than it
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.820]  and that's an example of what I'm talking about
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.820]  fish oil is liquid
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.820]  energy brain
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.820]  body heart the cleanest the best out there
[01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.820]  you've got the children's
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.820]  you've got the adults you've got the krill oil
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:22.820]  if you're going to get the full effect the fish oil
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.820]  and the children's are really strong
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:26.820]  they don't give you the burpees but krill oil is the best
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.820]  and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm just sorry
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:30.820]  you want something like this you don't get stuff for free
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.820]  the krill is hallucinogenic
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.820]  it's so good in my view
[01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:36.820]  I'm not a human medical statement here but let me tell you something
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:38.820]  I eat 5 campelots of krill oil before I go to bed
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.820]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:44.820]  so your brain is made
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.820]  basically out of what fish oil is
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:50.820]  so we don't make a big profit off of it
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:52.820]  but you notice I just obsess
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:54.820]  because whatever the best is we've got
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.820]  I just can't lie to you I just can't do it
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.820]  we've taken thousands of years of known research
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:02.820]  and put it together with our own four years
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:04.820]  of seeking and testing
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.820]  to find the very best systems that God gave us
[01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.820]  through Mother Nature to detoxify the body
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.820]  that's why I'm introducing Z-Shield
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:12.820]  Toxic metal and chemical
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:14.820]  defense support it's made in the USA
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.820]  it's filled with known
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.820]  compounds from nature that are
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.820]  absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.820]  and it supports the inflow war
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.820]  it is a classical 360 win
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:26.820]  this is the formula that I personally have been taking
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:28.820]  for over a year and now we believe
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:30.820]  we have come as close to perfection
[01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:32.820]  when it comes to a detoxifier
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:34.820]  as you can possibly get
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:36.820]  you owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.820]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.820]  that patriots stay as healthy
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.820]  and as clean and as focused
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.820]  as you can be because we need you
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.820]  the remnant of America
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.820]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:50.820]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.820]  thanks to your support and your prayers together
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.820]  we're changing the world now it's time to
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:56.820]  change our bodies with Z-Shield
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:33:12.820]  or ZLIVE.com
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:30.820]  Thanks Jones
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.820]  Tracy Shannon
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:34.820]  is at the hospital in Houston
[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:36.820]  she's about to get another grandbaby
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:38.820]  very excited she may have to go anytime
[01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:40.820]  but baby what's up there coming right now
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:42.820]  we're going to protect that baby
[01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:44.820]  from the two convicted child rapist
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:46.820]  who dress up in demonic
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.820]  clown outfits scarier than at the clown
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:50.820]  and who are with a bunch of other
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.820]  men disguising their identities
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.820]  a bunch of admitted sex workers
[01:33:54.820 --> 01:33:56.820]  in fact let's play this clip first
[01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:58.820]  here's a clip we've been playing
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.820]  quite a few times
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:02.820]  and this is an admitted in the full video
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:04.820]  sex worker
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.820]  at a Lafayette Louisiana
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.820]  city council meeting
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:10.820]  saying oh at night
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.820]  I dress as a woman entertained
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.820]  men at the local gay club but
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:16.820]  when I'm with your children it's different
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:18.820]  and you won't stop me hater
[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:20.820]  I'm going to groom your children
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.820]  and so that's what's going on here
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:24.820]  and it's the same formula
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.820]  not just here but in Europe
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.820]  it's called drag queen story time
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:30.820]  the media promotes it
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:32.820]  the corporate media
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:34.820]  say one that promotes open borders and Islam
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.820]  they bring them in
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:38.820]  they don't check their ID
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:40.820]  they don't check their background
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:42.820]  and in places like Colorado and Denver
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:44.820]  they don't even tell the parents they come in the school
[01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:46.820]  so you can watch
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:48.820]  the full video
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:50.820]  at info wars.com
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:52.820]  drag queen admits he's grooming
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.820]  children at story hour
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:22.820]  events here's that clip
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.820]  I'm going to be very beautiful
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:28.820]  and for the children and the people that supported
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:30.820]  are going to realize that this is going to be
[01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:32.820]  the grooming of the next generation
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:34.820]  we are trying to groom the next generation
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:36.820]  to not see the way that they just did
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:38.820]  and just because I said that
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.820]  you heard the little plur people behind me
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:42.820]  it's disgusting
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:44.820]  he goes on to say your children are ours
[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:46.820]  so I'm going to groom your children
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:48.820]  for the next generation
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.820]  and I'm going to do it
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:54.820]  your kids are going to sit on my lap
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:56.820]  now
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:35:58.820]  anybody else at that in a park they get in trouble
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.820]  but what's happening
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.820]  is no wonder they wear disguises
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:04.820]  and I started noticing this last year I said
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.820]  at their own parties we're looking at their Facebooks
[01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:08.820]  we've got obviously investigators looking at them
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:10.820]  not just here but other areas
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:12.820]  I said because we know who's running this whole show
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.820]  we're going to bring the whole group down
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:16.820]  but I said notice
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:18.820]  it's a disguise
[01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:20.820]  from England to the US they wear the same clown outfits
[01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:22.820]  they're directed by the same group
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.820]  because a lot of them have convictions
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:26.820]  that's why they show up by Buzz
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:28.820]  they show up by Uber they sneak into the building
[01:36:28.820 --> 01:36:30.820]  and just imagine
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.820]  these are people that are so obsessed
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.820]  with time with your children
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.820]  so crazed
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.820]  they can't stop and the pedophiles can't stop
[01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:42.820]  and so they've spent jail time sometimes years in jail
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.820]  for raping little kids they kidnapped
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.820]  and now the liberals
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:50.820]  are like we're going to let them
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:52.820]  have your kids
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.820]  we're going to let them have time with your kids
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:56.820]  so going back to Tracy Shannon
[01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.820]  massresistance.org
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:00.820]  you were getting into how you woke up what you saw
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:02.820]  no Christianity nothing allowed
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:04.820]  in these things but oh this is allowed
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.820]  their own sexualization
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.820]  of children their own grooming
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:10.820]  their own vampirist religion
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:12.820]  and then boom you discover the first guy
[01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:14.820]  now the second guy
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:16.820]  and the stuff on your website I can hardly even show it
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:18.820]  but people need to see it
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:20.820]  this is frightening
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.820]  men in bondage outfits
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.820]  this is all being introduced to children
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:28.820]  right and we started looking
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:30.820]  at the social media
[01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:32.820]  of the drag queen
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:34.820]  a volunteer at the library
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:36.820]  just so we could show our city council
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.820]  that these are not people to be
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:40.820]  held out as role models to our children
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.820]  and that they are adult entertainers
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.820]  who push the boundaries
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.820]  of sexuality
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.820]  and that's what they do all the time
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:50.820]  and we have a video of one of these
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:52.820]  of reading to a kid talking about
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.820]  how she prefers a long island iced tea
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.820]  I mean this is
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:58.820]  these people are not me
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:00.820]  it should not be in the library with children
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:02.820]  wrong
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.820]  the guy that runs it all is a convicted murderer out of New York
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:06.820]  that chops money up with a buzz saw
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:08.820]  and then in their own video with kids talking about taking
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.820]  ketamine and rohibinol
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:12.820]  oh wow
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.820]  yeah I mean
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:16.820]  there's a lot of interesting people
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:18.820]  involved in this to say the least
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.820]  they say this is to promote
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.820]  diversity and inclusion and love
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:24.820]  and all that but children are naturally
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:26.820]  accepting and we shouldn't be trying
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.820]  to traumatize
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.820]  them or shock them
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.820]  into acceptance
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.820]  if you're a good person
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:36.820]  a child is going to accept you
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:38.820]  you don't have to force it with this
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.820]  shocking stuff they're doing with children
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:42.820]  and wrong-headed parents bringing
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.820]  their kids in there thinking that they're
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.820]  going to promote their children
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.820]  to be diverse and accepting
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:50.820]  they're really getting kids to lower
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:52.820]  their own guard
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:54.820]  their own natural instincts to something that feels wrong
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.820]  they shouldn't be doing that
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.820]  and the sad part
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.820]  and all of this is
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:02.820]  you've got a sex offender
[01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:04.820]  out in front of the library
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:06.820]  luring kids in with flowers and inside
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.820]  a sex offender to read them a book
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:10.820]  parents think oh I'm promoting love
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:12.820]  and diversity and acceptance
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:14.820]  oh my gosh this is so wrong
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.820]  it's so wrong-headed as a parent
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:18.820]  parents get a clue wake up don't be bringing
[01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:20.820]  your kids directly in story hour
[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:22.820]  but beyond that and I commend
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:24.820]  you for what you guys have done the great research
[01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:26.820]  this is being pushed all over
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:28.820]  national news all over BBC
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.820]  as the most wonderful thing since sliced bread
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:32.820]  and then you go look at
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:34.820]  where it comes from and who runs it
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:36.820]  it's literal sexualization
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:38.820]  you know we're going to educate
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.820]  your kids about our lifestyle
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:42.820]  that it's just obese big fat
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.820]  gross men dressed as women
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:46.820]  telling your kids to sit on their laps
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:48.820]  and touch them I mean this is the most obscene
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:50.820]  sickening over the top garbage
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:52.820]  and it's given total air
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.820]  superiority by the corporate media
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:56.820]  right and if I'm a pervert
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.820]  I'm looking at these wrong-headed parents
[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:00.820]  who are just in love with the idea
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:02.820]  of diversity and that's their highest
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.820]  value that they can't even see the perversity
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:06.820]  they're exposing their kids to
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:08.820]  and if I'm a pervert I'm like
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.820]  look at these parents their guards are completely lowered
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.820]  I think I'll go hang around it
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:14.820]  drag queen story hour maybe volunteer
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:16.820]  it's just such a bad idea
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:18.820]  and that it's got the government
[01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:20.820]  stamp of approval on it down here
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.820]  in Houston and other places and
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.820]  American Library Association
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.820]  colluding with librarians
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.820]  and even in their own language using words
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.820]  like be a secret agent
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:32.820]  pushing drag queen
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.820]  story hour and LGBTQ
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.820]  content into the library
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:38.820]  and he's got no secret agent
[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.820]  and he's already demonically influenced
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.820]  they just know their God
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:44.820]  makes them feel powerful and they do bad things
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.820]  so the left is being seduced in actual
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.820]  psychic vampirism over children
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:52.820]  they just want to
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:54.820]  have complete control over
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:56.820]  what everybody thinks not even
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.820]  these children and you can't even
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:00.820]  disagree with us like I've had
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.820]  people from
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:04.820]  hold on a second we'll do one more segment
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:06.820]  whether your cell phone is going out here on us
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.820]  we appreciate you coming on on short notice
[01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.820]  I want to fly you
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:12.820]  and your whole great crew
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:14.820]  up here to put you up in hotels
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:16.820]  whatever in the next few weeks to come on
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.820]  there to tell us how to help you investigate
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.820]  I've got investigators
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:22.820]  in New York and other areas of Texas
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.820]  on the ground we're getting intel
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.820]  that is absolutely beyond
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:28.820]  evil
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:30.820]  on this whole network so
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.820]  I would like to get you in studio
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:34.820]  so that we can actually talk about
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:36.820]  what you've done but as we
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:38.820]  go to break if your cell phone is not breaking up
[01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:40.820]  let me ask you this question
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:42.820]  how did you we took a lot of investigation
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.820]  because the guy was wearing a clown
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:46.820]  a demon clown outfit
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:48.820]  how did you discover
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:50.820]  that the demon clown
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:52.820]  William Travis Dees was a convicted child
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:54.820]  rapist
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.820]  well through his own social media
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:58.820]  we knew there were things wrong
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:00.820]  we found that he was
[01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.820]  a prostitute and a
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:04.820]  done porn like as a trans
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.820]  porn star and
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.820]  through his own admission and oracle he wrote
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:10.820]  so we were looking more into that
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.820]  and then there was a post by his mother
[01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:14.820]  and just comparing it some background
[01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:16.820]  checks that we ran
[01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:18.820]  that with the name he's going by now
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:20.820]  and the addresses
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.820]  and phone numbers we did searches
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:24.820]  on those that tied him to the other name
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:26.820]  well then we needed the face to match the name
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.820]  and some proof
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:30.820]  and mostly social media
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:32.820]  I'd say Google is a powerful tool
[01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:34.820]  and I think maybe the library
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.820]  ought to learn how to use it
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.820]  and again law enforcement's
[01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.820]  not doing it
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.820]  a mother a grandmother's doing it
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.820]  and we're doing it and that's what Lester's supporting us
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:46.820]  is so critical supporting you

[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.820]  that they are basically
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:38.820]  trying to control and steal the future

[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:08.820]  now I can be there for my children
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:10.820]  now I can make them strong
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.820]  now I can instruct them
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:14.820]  but not once I'm gone
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.820]  you think of this digital age your words going forever
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:18.820]  but now they're even better getting rid of what you said they were before
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:20.820]  it's so much easier to burn video
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:22.820]  or text or languages
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:24.820]  now that we have high tech book burning isn't it
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:26.820]  but I have joined my will
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.820]  to the resistance
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.820]  I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:32.820]  I've done right and as long as the people know the truth
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.820]  and you can't be destroyed either
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.820]  as long as you bind yourself
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.820]  to something and commit to it
[01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:40.820]  and go through the fire for it
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:42.820]  and the magic that then takes place
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:44.820]  the transcend space and time
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:46.820]  when you commit be a word of mouth
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:48.820]  or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:50.820]  that overrides everything the enemy's doing
[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:52.820]  so please now commit to support

[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:32.820]  Music
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.820]  You know there's an
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:36.820]  analogy I want to engage
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:38.820]  here everybody knows about
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.820]  sometimes a thread comes out
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.820]  on your sweater or your shirt
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:44.820]  if you pull that thread
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:46.820]  the whole sweater or the whole
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:48.820]  shirt just unravels
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:50.820]  the whole arm comes off
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:52.820]  and I'm telling you
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:54.820]  we're one globalist operations across the planet
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:56.820]  we've already defeated Hillary together
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:58.820]  we've already devastated the EU
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:00.820]  we've done it together
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:02.820]  this broadcast is the detonator
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:04.820]  and the enemy knows that
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.820]  and I'm telling you I smell it
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:08.820]  spiritually I see it
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.820]  intellectually I know it politically
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:12.820]  I absolutely have documented
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:14.820]  it through the criminology
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:16.820]  that this is
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:18.820]  a worldwide
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.820]  pedophile cult that many top globalists
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.820]  have called in
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:24.820]  and their ring fields their vanguard
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:26.820]  are sex offenders
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:28.820]  child rapists
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:30.820]  I mean we mean brutal aggravated
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.820]  crabbing kids kidnapping them
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.820]  dragging them into a shed raping them
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:36.820]  I've got the police reports
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:38.820]  and that's what they got caught for
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.820]  you might get caught for one in a hundred
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:42.820]  and you go to these events
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:44.820]  you cover these events it's men
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:46.820]  literally going
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.820]  they are so scary
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.820]  they are coming after your kids
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:52.820]  and they mean business
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:54.820]  and that's why mayors are defending them
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:56.820]  it's why the AP
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:48:58.820]  and Reuters and CNN
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.820]  are saying it's great
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.820]  is because this is their religion
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:04.820]  and their bosses are involved
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:08.820]  and more is going to come out
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:10.820]  the problem is they show up at your school
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.820]  on an ounce they show up at the library
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.820]  and they pull up in vans with other people
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:18.820]  they are guarding who they are
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.820]  so it takes investigations to do this
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:24.820]  but as people on the ground
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:26.820]  like our guest who is doing an incredible job
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:28.820]  expose all of this
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.820]  as this is done
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.820]  they are going to get scarier and scarier
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:36.820]  and scarier and know that we are on their tail
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:38.820]  Tracy Shannon you are getting into
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:42.820]  you are there with your grandbaby
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:44.820]  born at the hospital with a cell phone
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.820]  about how you and others did the tracking
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:48.820]  found who they were
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.820]  and I know you are working on other leads right now
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:52.820]  so are we but man I tell you
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:54.820]  these are some bold folks
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.820]  but from what I know about pedophiles
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:58.820]  they are fiends
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:00.820]  they can't stop going after children
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:04.820]  I think there is just no boundaries
[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:06.820]  there is just no boundaries
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.820]  and there is some arrogance
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.820]  and especially down here in Houston
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:12.820]  there is this attitude
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.820]  that you can't even scrutinize this
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:16.820]  and I think that applies to all of the LGBTQ community
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.820]  I am not painting them with a broad brush
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:22.820]  but the LBGT community is now P
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.820]  they are supporting the pedophiles
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:26.820]  yeah I mean
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:28.820]  I have been getting some calls from some
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.820]  that are very upset that people are not
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.820]  taking a position against Drag Queen Story Hour
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:34.820]  or that people covered for these pedophiles
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:36.820]  and that like a restaurant
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:38.820]  called Hamburger Marys here
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:40.820]  the manager actually said
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:42.820]  we are scrubbing our social media
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:44.820]  of any association with Tanteana Malinina
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.820]  the bad girl the one that was a pedophile
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.820]  because they didn't want the parents
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:50.820]  to take their kids there
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:52.820]  for their family Sunday brunches
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:54.820]  to know they were having a pedophile performer
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.820]  in their restaurant
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:58.820]  so the community
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:00.820]  there is some division happening there
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.820]  but there is just a lack of scrutiny
[01:51:02.820 --> 01:51:04.820]  because they even
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:06.820]  look at something
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:08.820]  and use common sense and criticize it
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:10.820]  you do background checks
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:12.820]  on teachers
[01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:14.820]  you do them on cops
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:16.820]  yeah I mean
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:18.820]  to volunteer the food pantry that I volunteer at
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:20.820]  I have to do a background check
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:22.820]  because it is run by a church
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:24.820]  and children are in churches so I have to do
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:26.820]  routinely every year
[01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:28.820]  for all kinds of organizations my kids are in
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:30.820]  and that I volunteer in
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:32.820]  everyone should be doing them when there is children involved
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.820]  absolutely I don't care who you are
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.820]  if you are LGBTQ
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:38.820]  that is not being discriminating
[01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:40.820]  that is just common sense we do it to protect the children
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:42.820]  it should be the policy
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.820]  it should be strictly followed in addition to looking at social media
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:46.820]  of these volunteers
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:48.820]  because they may not be appropriate to be around children at all
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.820]  now what has happened so far
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:52.820]  I have seen different reports
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:54.820]  but you guys have gotten the
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:56.820]  story time with sex offenders
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.820]  canceled for now
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.820]  for now the library doubled down
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:02.820]  and said they are bringing it back
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:04.820]  procedures and policies
[01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:06.820]  but we have so much evidence
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.820]  of malfeasance on their part
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:10.820]  and I am still waiting
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.820]  my documents from the FOIA and others are waiting theirs
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:14.820]  and then we will have
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:16.820]  more dots connect
[01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:18.820]  regarding their malfeasance
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:20.820]  protecting this program
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.820]  denying people
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.820]  who are part of the press
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:26.820]  I have tried to
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:28.820]  and I have a press pass and I don't even
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:30.820]  need to have a press pass to report it
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.820]  but the person may let right to report it
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:34.820]  these events
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:36.820]  they are in a public venue
[01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:38.820]  and instead of running a swingers club
[01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:40.820]  with consenting adults
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:42.820]  those get shut down
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:44.820]  this is literally an event for grooming children
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:46.820]  and they are trying to keep you from filming it
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:48.820]  they want to screen the people
[01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:50.820]  who cover it
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:52.820]  and they also have a binder
[01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:54.820]  with people they call
[01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:56.820]  known infiltrators like myself
[01:52:56.820 --> 01:52:58.820]  they circulated
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.820]  let's say that again
[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:02.820]  known infiltrators, grandmothers
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.820]  that don't want children sitting on the lap
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:06.820]  of convicted pedophiles
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.820]  they've got to stop you the infiltrator
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:10.820]  that's right and also they circulated
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:12.820]  a flyer calling me a predator
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.820]  because I went in there with a rainbow wig
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:16.820]  and heavy makeup
[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:18.820]  and recorded
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:20.820]  drag queen story

[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:28.820]  here and everywhere

[01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:32.820]  have you noticed your mayor
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:34.820]  obviously this is a bad person
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:36.820]  he's probably been compromised
[01:53:36.820 --> 01:53:38.820]  obviously more ways than one
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:40.820]  from what I know from law enforcement
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:42.820]  well I'm going to stop right there
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:44.820]  people are looking at the super bowl
[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:46.820]  I'm just going to stop right there
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:48.820]  but oh yeah we know everything basically
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:50.820]  think about how this whole thing is so coordinated
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:52.820]  though all over the world
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:54.820]  introducing children to giant fat sex predators
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:56.820]  yeah
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:58.820]  I mean I don't know who's
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:00.820]  behind the coordination globally
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:02.820]  besides maybe the antichrist
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:04.820]  but have you noticed
[01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:06.820]  it's all the same nomenclature
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:08.820]  all the same words well let me tell you who's behind a lot of it
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:10.820]  let me play this for you
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.820]  this is Desmond is amazing

[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.820]  and then he's in a video
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.820]  with axe murderer
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:26.820]  Michael Eilig

[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:32.820]  being having gang sex
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:34.820]  with a line of gay men

[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:00.820]  drove through rush hour traffic
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.820]  to get here
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.820]  hot hot hot hot tea
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.820]  it's 9 40 p.m. and he doesn't have to
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:08.820]  go to school tomorrow
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:12.820]  alright that's a date
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:14.820]  rape drug they're coming out
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.820]  with a picture behind them and their whole cult
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:18.820]  is the drugging of children
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:20.820]  so going back to our guest Tracy
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.820]  Shannon who I want you to please come up
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:24.820]  with your crew next few weeks to Austin
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:26.820]  so we can compare notes and coordinate
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.820]  because these pedos aren't going to stop
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.820]  we're going to have to move against them we already are
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:32.820]  but I can fill in some of the gaps
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:34.820]  for you what did you make of that
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.820]  well it's
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:38.820]  I've seen that before it's entirely
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:40.820]  inappropriate what's happening with these kids
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:42.820]  at drag con for example
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:44.820]  where I've seen
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:46.820]  children as young as 18 months old
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:48.820]  dressed in drag being carried in by their parents
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:50.820]  their parents are completely insane
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:52.820]  and then it's just
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:54.820]  a child shouldn't even know these words
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:56.820]  referring to
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.820]  date rape drugs they shouldn't know
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:00.820]  or the other drug which lowers inhibitions
[01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:02.820]  of people so they
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.820]  can have sex it's just
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.820]  really horrible that this child
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:08.820]  is being exposed to that you hear his voice
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.820]  he's a young tiny child
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:12.820]  he's a victim
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:14.820]  and just so you know they put the kids
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.820]  that were in the mine cave on ketamine
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:18.820]  because it turns off pain and anxiety
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:20.820]  ketamine is used so that 15 guys
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:22.820]  can line up and wreck the hell out
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:24.820]  of somebody so it's meant
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.820]  to make the muscles relax so they can
[01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:28.820]  literally rape the hell out of a kid
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:30.820]  and not have them go to the hospital
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:32.820]  that's disgusting
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:34.820]  it is disgusting and I only
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.820]  learned about it researching I'm like what's this ketamine
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:38.820]  oh that's what gay men take
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:40.820]  up to 50 dudes line up
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.820]  and have sex with them that's right
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.820]  and little kids are on tv talking
[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.820]  about it we'll be right back

[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:00.820]  children in your household bring them
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.820]  to the screen right now
[02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.820]  what we're going to show you
[02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:06.820]  is going to use an impression on them
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:08.820]  and we hope the impression will be
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:10.820]  that they grow up if they're
[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:12.820]  3 or 4 or 5 years old
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:14.820]  to become 7 or 8 year old and drag queens or clowns
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:16.820]  music
[02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:18.820]  so when they've taken
[02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:20.820]  thousands of hits of axe taking all this
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:22.820]  ketamine these guys have no brains they're just
[02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:24.820]  vessels
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.820]  for the avatar and that's what our research shows
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:28.820]  that they're gone
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:30.820]  they're demon possessed
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:32.820]  and they want kids that's the energy
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:34.820]  and I'm telling you folks I've studied
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.820]  what they're into and then they get mayors
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:38.820]  and other people corrupted and into it
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:40.820]  and they blackmail city officials
[02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.820]  and their armies
[02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:44.820]  of sex workers
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:46.820]  and then once they blackmail you
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:48.820]  then this is what they do
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:50.820]  and then they take control of your city
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:52.820]  and then they say well what do you want
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:54.820]  we want access to children
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:56.820]  so in closing I want to invite Tracy Shannon
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:58.820]  back soon in studio
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:00.820]  I appreciate you fighting back
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:02.820]  I wouldn't even say you're a hero you just have life
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.820]  instincts
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:06.820]  you have life force and we salute you
[02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:08.820]  that's another point you'd like to make
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:10.820]  no that's it
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:12.820]  for now we're going to continue to work
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:14.820]  on busting these drag queens
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:16.820]  story hours until they're down and stay down
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:18.820]  and not just in Houston, Texas
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.820]  either we're going to take them all down
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:22.820]  it's inappropriate for
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:24.820]  children and it will not be tolerated
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:26.820]  it's inappropriate to have convicted child rapist
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.820]  just two that you researched out of the
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:30.820]  10 or so convicted child rapist
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:32.820]  and it's inappropriate for little kids
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:34.820]  to be handed over to them
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:36.820]  yeah it's all inappropriate
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:38.820]  even if we didn't find a pedophile
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:40.820]  convicted pedophile this would be inappropriate
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:42.820]  we don't
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:44.820]  children do not have the job
[02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:46.820]  to validate adult choices
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:48.820]  adult behaviors and adult identities
[02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:50.820]  if that's their identity
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:52.820]  they need to get comfortable with it on their own
[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:54.820]  and don't drag children into it
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:56.820]  I agree
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:58.820]  you've been out there in person around them
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.820]  and we've gone and covered it too
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:02.820]  it's very demonic
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:04.820]  like if I went to a Halloween party
[02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:06.820]  and people would dress like that and say
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:08.820]  what are you like vampire clowns
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:10.820]  and it's weird men in makeup
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:12.820]  I can't even make the faces
[02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:14.820]  they're so demonic so hateful
[02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.820]  well I mean
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:18.820]  we have parents pushing their kids towards them
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:20.820]  and the kids trying to run away
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:22.820]  and crying and then the mother
[02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:24.820]  pushing the little boy back over to the parent
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:26.820]  and goes
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:28.820]  what the hell is wrong with you today
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:30.820]  it's just horrible how
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:32.820]  the parents are squashing
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.820]  their kids natural instincts to run from something
[02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:36.820]  that's scary
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:38.820]  when you take your kids to Santa and they don't want to go
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.820]  on their kids' laps
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:42.820]  generally you have some compassion and don't start screaming
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:44.820]  what's wrong with you
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:46.820]  you bad children you don't want to go to a convicted child
[02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:48.820]  rapist dressed like a demon clown
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:50.820]  what's wrong with you you're not liberal
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:52.820]  and then you go further they're still
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:54.820]  defending it
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.820]  it's a spiritual delusion
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:58.820]  they're defending it
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:00.820]  and we want to get to the bottom
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:02.820]  of why they're defending it
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:04.820]  and who's defending it
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:06.820]  who's funding it
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:08.820]  there could be more here
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:10.820]  like you're saying
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:12.820]  there could be a much bigger story here
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:14.820]  so we're not going to stop looking
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.820]  and I've heard other people
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.820]  speculate the same things that you're speculating
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:20.820]  that there's some really sinister reasons
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.820]  this is a pedophile network
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:24.820]  literally like an angler fish
[02:04:24.820 --> 02:04:26.820]  coming to get the children
[02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:28.820]  that's why it's so protected
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:30.820]  that's why they call you a predator
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:32.820]  that's why they say we're secret agents
[02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.820]  against you because they're running an operation
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:36.820]  and there's a lot of money
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:38.820]  and a lot of power to do this
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:40.820]  and this is their offensive
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:42.820]  alright massresistance.org
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.820]  everybody share that link

[02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:42.820]  you're done
[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:46.820] , not before
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:58.580]  People are so easy to defeat.
[02:06:58.580 --> 02:07:05.260]  The average man's too busy playing fantasy football, nagging top of his buddy's pot-bellied
[02:07:05.260 --> 02:07:12.660]  vampire goblins hobbling around, go after our children.
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:16.700]  We ought to air that piece, that Bon Iver piece they did that years ago that was so viral,
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:18.620]  had like 50 million views or whatever.
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:21.140]  We ought to play that today.
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:28.380]  I want to open the phones up about gangs of pedophiles disguised as clowns being given
[02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:34.620]  access to elementary schools, libraries, other facilities, in some cases without even telling
[02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:36.780]  parents.
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:41.740]  And the weirdo parents that are bringing their kids to it, they're all involved in this dark
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:42.740]  energy.
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:47.740]  And what did you just think of that last hour of incredible information?
[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:53.180]  Your children belong to us, we're going to corrupt them, we are child rapists, give them
[02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:54.180]  to us.
[02:07:54.180 --> 02:08:00.460]  And the mayor is like, I like it, I'm going to protect it.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:07.060]  You know, Houston was a safe zone for mass sex crimes and pedophilia during the last
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:11.260]  Super Bowl.
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:16.620]  And I was told that by federal and state law enforcement, high level.
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:25.940]  And I was told they weren't even able to get in there and stop it.
[02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:29.980]  And I was only told that because they knew I was covertly funding groups trying to infiltrate
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:30.980]  it.
[02:08:30.980 --> 02:08:35.100]  So I got visits.
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:44.940]  It was that two years ago, it all runs together now.
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:48.980]  You know, cops that actually investigated end up dead and it's not the little potbelly
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:55.740]  Renfields that kill them, use the allegory Dracula shows up.
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:09:02.100]  And I guess we just let them run everything then, I guess they're better than us, they're
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:06.740]  stronger than us, there's no men will stand up against them and do anything anymore.
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:13.180]  It's a little potbellied minions to go out there and do whatever they want.
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:23.060]  Let me tell you, Dracula doesn't send anybody of any worth to these events as human shields
[02:09:23.060 --> 02:09:32.060]  or sandbags or suicide bombers politically, since the worst he's got scum, show, mind
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:37.860]  alone, so convicted that no one would ever listen to him.
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:41.900]  But I'll tell you something right now.
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:50.860]  The currency of the world government is babies being harvested and little kids being tortured.
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:55.020]  And we sit here with states passing laws to kill babies after they're born.
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:10:00.620]  And we sit here with the pedophile armies rising against us.
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:07.060]  And the arrogant leftist city councils drunk on the blood of the innocents.
[02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:12.700]  And it just becomes a repeat of the Bible, doesn't it?
[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:19.500]  Drunk on the blood of children, the Antichrist is.
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:23.380]  And you look at these, I mean, if you saw people walking on the street, you'd recoil.
[02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:30.100]  I can't make the faces they make as they're so demonic, but it's just like, let me have
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:37.740]  time with your children now, give me your children, give them to me now.
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:47.660]  You will give them to me or I'll call you racist.
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:54.820]  You think that guy only raped a six year old and got caught a decade ago and went to jail
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:58.820]  for a few years?
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:03.220]  That's an inductee right there.
[02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:11.220]  That's Renfield, a demon posing as a woman, a woman that gives life, that nurtures babies
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.740]  and these poor babies.
[02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:19.620]  The last thing they see when they enter hell is men dressed as women.
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:24.140]  The last thing they see is they're hacked up and torn into pieces and as their blood
[02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:33.220]  is slovenly licked into the mouths and no men will stand against them.
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:46.620]  And when the men watching the show stand before God, God's going to say, I don't know you
[02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:54.300]  because you wouldn't protect children from pedophiles dressed like clowns.
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.940]  That's how it goes down.
[02:11:55.940 --> 02:12:04.260]  That's how it all ends.
[02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:16.540]  That's who wrangles your children into the trucks, into the vans and they want your children
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:20.220]  not to run when they're in the disguises and the van pulls up.
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:23.580]  They want them to have already been at story time five or six times so they've learned
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:29.060]  to stop just long enough to be grabbed off that front yard because the kid didn't listen,
[02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:35.060]  mom's asleep inside, she worked two shifts and it's like you're in the van now.
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:37.260]  Bye bye.
[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:38.260]  Get the clown.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:39.260]  Come on over here, Georgie.
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:40.260]  Oh, your boat.
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:43.060]  I got your boat right here.
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:47.860]  Just reach in and get your boat, Georgie.
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:48.860]  What's down there?
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:50.420]  Oh, there's clowns, popcorn.
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:54.220]  It's all down there, Georgie.
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:57.940]  Just stick your arm in here and I'm going to rip it off.
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:01.300]  But Georgie's lucky, actually.
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:05.380]  And Stephen King's little vision, the old Stephen King kind of letting you in on a little
[02:13:05.380 --> 02:13:06.380]  something.
[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:13.020]  Oh, Stephen King, what a nice person Stephen King is.
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:17.540]  He temporarily opposes anyone against drag queen story time.
[02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:20.300]  You didn't know that?
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:30.540]  Stephen King is a good pal and he doesn't like President Trump and he doesn't like me.
[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:37.820]  But he can write all those books about what goes on down there with the clowns.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:43.380]  The clowns that torture your children to death for a big fat spider.
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:50.700]  See, if the clown's just an angler fish, it's just a finger of a big spider down a hole.
[02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:57.620]  And it sends this up to say, hey, Georgie, sit on my lap, Georgie, touch my beard, Georgie.
[02:13:57.620 --> 02:14:01.020]  And Georgie, it's a free will universe.
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:11.500]  Take your hand in this dark hole, Georgie, and I'm going to show you that you'll float.
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:14.460]  And they all tell you it's their religion.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:17.980]  And they're going to get your catch, they're going to get them with vaccines, they're going
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:21.220]  to get them with fluoride, they're going to get them with GMO, they're going to get them
[02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:24.340]  with the culture, they're going to get them with the iPhones all because they couldn't
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:26.940]  kill them before they were born or right when they were born.
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:27.940]  But that's even better.
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:32.940]  Georgie, let a child grow a little, have some love, have some parents, and be a good little
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:35.900]  person and then they can get them in a dark pit.
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:39.340]  Oh, and then it's so good.
[02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:42.940]  The energy, these demons suck off your child.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:45.940]  It's so much better than just giving them cancer because, you know, the parents are
[02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:49.620]  there when the child's dying from the cancer from a vaccine.
[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:50.620]  And so they still have love.
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:56.500]  It's just not as special, but to have them in those dungeons all alone.
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:01.020]  And then all the guys in clown outfits pull back when Dracula comes in and they're licking
[02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:02.500]  their lips and they're scared of Dracula.
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:08.540]  A lot of them got abused by Dracula, but they're still hoping for a little bit of that blood.
[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:12.780]  And then Dracula goes in there and rips that child to pieces and drinks that blood and
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:17.700]  takes their guts and just eats it and then leaves and then the vampire minions just
[02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:23.580]  run and just lick the blood off the altar, lick the blood off the altar and then Dracula's
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:27.940]  women come in, all the porn stars and all the sexy women that want to live forever and
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:32.140]  they come in and they just eat little pieces of their feet and arms and they revel in the
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:36.380]  blood and have sex at it and call for the end of humanity, the end of God and just pray
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:41.340]  for Lucifer to enter their bodies and they're launching their full attack against you now.
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:49.300]  So take your vaccines, eat your GMO, watch MSNBC, watch Senator Blumenthal, their leader.
[02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:55.500]  Yes, I see you Blumenthal, I see you.
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:59.260]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US.
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:04.020]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally

[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:30.300]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:31.860]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:34.820]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:38.100]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with

[02:16:54.820 --> 02:17:00.220]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:01.220]  the world.
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:04.220]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:10.180]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.180 --> 02:17:13.980]  In its former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:14.980]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:16.540]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:23.100]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available

[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:26.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:51.500]  I'm not a rocket scientist, I made some calls to pilots I know that fly those.
[02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:55.300]  I talked to the pilot on a Southwest flight where the plane was one of those.
[02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:59.380]  The very day that Trump grounded them, I was flying back from Mexico on one, shot a video
[02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:06.260]  that we played here, and they said, yeah, these companies aren't training their pilots.
[02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:10.740]  It's an autopilot issue that when the sensor gets confused, you have to turn it off two
[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:14.220]  buttons, people aren't being trained on that.
[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:17.900]  Well Boeing just came out minutes ago and said it was an issue of people not being properly
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:22.740]  trained that when the autopilot malfunctions to turn it off, they fight it instead.
[02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:28.180]  Now, I'm not a rocket scientist, I talked to the pilots, the system knew this a month
[02:21:28.180 --> 02:21:29.180]  ago.
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.660]  So what am I getting at?
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:36.220]  You get next month's news today, no matter how crazy it sounds, we're really getting
[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:39.660]  at the tributes while they want to stop the air.
[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:43.740]  Over and over and over and over again, and I meant to cover this story for a week.
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:50.300]  You saw that flight that took off in England, and it was supposed to go to Germany, but
[02:21:50.300 --> 02:21:54.540]  it landed in Scotland.
[02:21:54.540 --> 02:21:57.420]  British Airways flight was supposed to go to Germany, went to Scotland.
[02:21:57.420 --> 02:22:04.180]  When I first saw that over a week ago, I said that's going to be an autopilot problem that
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:07.940]  they were given the course by the airport, by the airline, it was a mistake.
[02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:11.620]  The pilots didn't even look because those things take off and land themselves.
[02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:15.580]  And top pilots are saying this is very dangerous because now when there's a real problem, people
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:17.420]  don't know how to fly the planes.
[02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:24.540]  Imagine you take off in London and you fly to Scotland, which is about the same distance
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:31.020]  from London to Germany, and you land and the pilots don't even figure it out until they're
[02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:32.020]  on the ground.
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:36.140]  So it's the same thing.
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:39.860]  Not in third world countries, but they don't usually have the best pilots.
[02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:45.540]  You've had two third world countries, one African, one Asian, have the issue.
[02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:50.180]  They knew, with this new software that led you a few years ago, that the sensor will
[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:57.420]  show that you've lost power and that you are basically plunging, and I think the plane's
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:05.140]  gone into a stall, and it puts the nose down, or it puts the flaps up, it does a bunch
[02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:09.660]  of stuff, and then you fight it, I'm on a pilot, and everything goes haywire.
[02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:15.380]  So again, everybody knew about this in aviation, but the media wouldn't tell us for such a
[02:23:15.380 --> 02:23:16.380]  long time.
[02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:22.740]  They go, oh, we got to ground it all, oh, Boeing sucks, America sucks, blah, blah, blah.
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:30.980]  Every other flight system, Airbus, you name it, it's got problems with the manual override.
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:37.180]  It's got problems with the automated flight systems where you just set where you want
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:40.700]  to go and sit back, and it takes care of it, and I'll go back to this.
[02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:44.660]  Everybody remember going back about 20 years ago, how rough flights were when you'd land
[02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:45.660]  or take off?
[02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:51.860]  Sometimes the planes slide all over the tarmac, and then suddenly that just stopped, didn't
[02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:52.860]  it?
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:59.100]  It's always such a smooth takeoff, such a smooth landing, because it's a computer doing it.
[02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:03.860]  But what happens when the automated flight control goes bad?
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:06.340]  You're in big trouble.
[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:10.020]  And the system always fights to cover it up.
[02:24:10.020 --> 02:24:19.100]  They knew exactly the problem a year ago when one of the 737-800s went down, and they knew
[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:26.500]  right away what happened in Kenya, but they don't want to tell you, and they never do.
[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:28.180]  That's the problem with self-driving cars.
[02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:31.660]  People can hack them, you don't know how to drive anymore, what if there's a mass outage
[02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:35.180]  in the system, what if there's a computer virus?
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:37.420]  It doesn't make us strong.
[02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:43.020]  So I think this should be looked at, but I think under law, as self-driving cars become
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:46.740]  ubiquitous, Mercedes all over coming out where the car just does it, and if it thinks you're
[02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:50.180]  driving bad, or it thinks you're tired, it pulls over.
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:57.860]  There should be a law that, half the time, you've got to drive yourself completely.
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:01.940]  Because calculators have killed mathematics, all of this is making us weaker.
[02:25:01.940 --> 02:25:06.180]  We're stupider than ever, and it allows the people programming the automation.
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:12.860]  People once were totally dependent on computers and robots, who programs them, the technocrats,
[02:25:12.860 --> 02:25:17.780]  and then they will rule everybody completely.
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:21.300]  Another big piece of news, as soon as I saw the photo in the video of this guy, he just
[02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:22.300]  looked like a scammer.
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:25.420]  I told my wife, I said, I bet this is a scam.
[02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:30.740]  14-year-old boy in Ohio says he is the Illinois child who went missing in 2011.
[02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:37.940]  Turns out he's not, and made it up for attention.
[02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:41.660]  He'll ask, well, why would you do something like that, and hurt the families?
[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:42.820]  See?
[02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:46.340]  But oh, that's my psychosis, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:50.860]  I immediately don't believe the first thing I'm told.
[02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:52.620]  I'm a skeptic.
[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:59.340]  But see, at first the police, not blaming them, really thought, well, it must be him.
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:03.220]  You know, who would dare do something so hurtful like this?
[02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:07.940]  And it's liars like that that then make us question every big public event, a lot of
[02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:10.580]  which are not to be true, and then we look bad for questioning it.
[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:12.540]  What are we supposed to do?
[02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:16.660]  I've never tried to hurt anybody in my life, didn't have it coming to them.
[02:26:16.660 --> 02:26:22.420]  You know, last segment, I had crew from all this building run up to me and say that was
[02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:26.220]  really dark and really scary and really powerful.
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:29.340]  And you know, the children being tortured to death by devil worshipers and corruption
[02:26:29.340 --> 02:26:35.340]  and the Democrats that support after birth abortion, like the governor, Northam and Senator
[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:38.340]  Blumenthal, that's what I was mentioning there.
[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:41.540]  Killing a baby at birth born is just the same as being a devil worshiper killing them.
[02:26:41.540 --> 02:26:45.820]  If you study black magic and the occult and the globalists, they're into exactly what
[02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:48.020]  I described.
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:52.060]  You don't just think, again, Ram Stoker came up with Dracula, where they've got minions
[02:26:52.060 --> 02:26:54.900]  that get the kids and then they got the Dracula above them.
[02:26:54.900 --> 02:27:00.220]  This is the real world that's happened over and over again in history.
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:05.700]  And now we've got predators on TV saying, your children belong to us, you're not gonna
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:06.700]  stop us.
[02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:12.580]  They've declared their attack because the average man or woman in this country is asleep.
[02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:17.180]  And then a grandmother who works multiple jobs in Houston gets upset because she was
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:20.300]  trying to go have a Christian Bible hour there and they said, no Christians allowed
[02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:21.300]  here.
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:22.300]  So she said, well, what's on the list?
[02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:26.140]  Oh, drag queens, what it really is, is men dressed up like women, a bunch of which have
[02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:30.220]  pedophile rape conventions, having their way with your kids.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:35.900]  But see, she's a nurturing person that has her maternal instincts, so she can't help
[02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:38.700]  but do it and they won't beat her.
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:43.500]  So I always talk about how the left claims they want women to be empowered.
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:45.660]  No, the globalists are scared of women.
[02:27:45.660 --> 02:27:49.900]  If women's instinct gets turned on right and the women start demanding men act like men,
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:54.540]  it's over because women, Hitler said it, evil genius.
[02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:59.380]  First you've got the women, then you've got the children.
[02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:00.660]  So follow the men.
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:07.580]  So it's time for women to stop leading this whole leftist Pied Piper, everybody into the
[02:28:07.580 --> 02:28:09.900]  oblivion, leading the kids into the lake to drown.
[02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:14.260]  It's time for women to start leading and demand men act like men and men get out there and
[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:15.260]  do something.
[02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:17.620]  Come back with your shields or on them.
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:22.980]  That's the Spartan statement, because in a war, if you're give up, you drop your weapons
[02:28:22.980 --> 02:28:25.180]  and run because you've been out, no.
[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:34.100]  You come back with your shields or on them, with your shields or on them, with your shields
[02:28:34.100 --> 02:28:40.820]  or on them, it is a shame that nine times out of 10, when it really comes to leadership,
[02:28:40.820 --> 02:28:41.820]  it's women.
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:46.900]  But that's what the globalist fear is women's true leadership in the clutch.
[02:28:46.900 --> 02:28:50.060]  It's going to be women that get men to get up off their damn asses.
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:55.420]  I'll give the number out, we'll take your calls straight ahead, stay with us.

[02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:24.340]  Jones.
[02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:30.860]  It was a big study came out yesterday, I didn't get to it, but it's in my stack today again.
[02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:36.100]  They did a big national study of the US and a record number of people so they don't believe
[02:33:36.100 --> 02:33:37.740]  in God or even have a religion.
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:41.260]  Well, the devil believes in you.
[02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:45.660]  I went up the phones up though about drag queen story time, it's really convicted pedophiles
[02:33:45.660 --> 02:33:49.340]  dressed up in clown outfits to protect the red entity to have their way with your children
[02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:53.500]  and who's orchestrating this all over the western world.
[02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:54.500]  Another second one busted.
[02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:59.340]  I want your take on this, I want your take on so much more, but please give me your comment
[02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:04.300]  on that and then whatever else you want to talk about, 877-789-2539, wide open phones,
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:12.420]  anytime callers, long time callers, first time callers, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex.
[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:19.380]  Now I'm going to go to your calls, but let me mention this because I'm a little jealous
[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:23.420]  of my good friend Pat Riley and he said he doesn't care, I can say his new son's name
[02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:24.420]  on air.
[02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:28.540]  I have to admit I came up with the name and he admits it's awesome sounding because Buck
[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:33.260]  Jones sounds okay, but Buck Riley sounds like space captain, doesn't it?
[02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:35.900]  So the first son's a great guy, they didn't name him Buck Riley, that was my day a few
[02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:36.900]  years ago.
[02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:43.140]  But the second son is named Buck Riley and handsome young son, so is the other son, plays
[02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:47.820]  with my two-year-old daughter, they're both two, the older son, the first son, but he
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:49.860]  didn't name this one Buck.
[02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:59.340]  And long story short, Ryda's Beto or Rourke was giving speeches, I was only elliptical
[02:34:59.340 --> 02:35:05.180]  like Tuesday and the baby just come and Beto was at another event than this Al Sharpton
[02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:10.380]  when he did yesterday saying, white people are bad, he talks like Bernie Sanders, his
[02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:16.300]  arms are all flapping around, not even controlled, but I mean it's just a joke what a fraud this
[02:35:16.300 --> 02:35:23.020]  guy is and he's like, yes we need to pay reparations, I will pass reparations if I become president
[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:29.340]  and I was looking at Buck Riley and I've got four kids, one son, three daughters and
[02:35:29.340 --> 02:35:33.980]  I love the daughters, they're just as good as a son, I think I treat them a lot better
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:40.780]  but I want to book in, I want another son, a pee pee baby is what we call it and I just
[02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:44.820]  need that and it's okay, I think I'm going to get one, God's been good to me, but the
[02:35:44.820 --> 02:35:50.100]  point is, is that I'm jealously looking at his handsome sons in a photo he sent me, the
[02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:55.820]  two-year-old next to the newborn baby and it just hit me because as I'm looking at it,
[02:35:55.820 --> 02:36:03.460]  CNN's on and it's Beto talking about Beto, I know I call him Beto, Beto, about the white
[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:08.940]  people of bed and they need to pay money and I'm looking at a newborn baby and I'm looking
[02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:14.660]  at his other son who's two and they haven't done anything, you wouldn't give him a misdemeanor,
[02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:22.340]  you wouldn't give him probation, you wouldn't give him a felony, but because they're white,
[02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:25.740]  because and by the way, I even asked Pat, I go, when's your family come here after the
[02:36:25.740 --> 02:36:34.660]  civil war? Irish, not your Pat Rowley or Irish, not even involved in slavery, doesn't matter,
[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:40.220]  he's white, so his kids are bad, that is so fundamentally racist and so fundamentally
[02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:47.100]  unfair and so flagrantly insane, it's like having convicted pedophiles at public schools
[02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:53.780]  having kids sit on their laps, this has got to stop, I don't care about babies black or
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:37:02.740]  Hispanic or Asian or what the hell, it hadn't done Jack Diddley squat and I can't believe
[02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:08.820]  I've got to sit here and even say that in 2019, I'm getting sick of these people and
[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:11.620]  I'll do the math again for you, somebody ought to do a mathematical, like Prager, you want
[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:19.340]  to do a mathematical equation on this, they do the best job, something like 70% of the
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:23.660]  people live in this country now, their families, their ancestors came here sometime after the
[02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:31.140]  civil war, that's just a fact, look it up, so 70% of people in this country, their ancestors
[02:37:31.140 --> 02:37:38.620]  came here after slavery, of course it's cocky, if your dad had slaves you shouldn't know,
[02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:43.980]  I mean it is crazy, but this is seven grand paused back, then the south was something
[02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:49.380]  like 30 or 5%, look it up, the southern population was a lot smaller than northern population,
[02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:54.460]  something like a third, the memory serves in a civil war, they had about 10th of the
[02:37:54.460 --> 02:37:58.740]  factories, so that's a third of the population, you got a third of the population was here
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:05.420]  before the end of the civil war in the south, you've got 70% that comes after, so it's a
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:11.900]  tiny portion already and then 2% of the south has slaves, so it is a tiny group of people
[02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:17.620]  that have any ancestors associated with it and then Beto says all white people owe money
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:22.060]  to black people and they're not going to give black people money, they're going to
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:27.220]  just take money in some new race cult and put it into some program to brainwash blacks
[02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:34.620]  and turn them into SJWs, you know that, but what did the Nazis and the Soviets do, if
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:41.500]  you resisted the Soviets especially under Stalin and Lenin before that, if somebody
[02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:46.060]  in your little town of 200 people resisted and say kill the commissar, they would arrest
[02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:52.380]  the town leadership and take them to Siberia for 20 years or they might execute some people
[02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:58.140]  and the Nazis, if one German soldier got killed in a town by one of the citizens, they would
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:04.580]  normally kill about 10 people, if an SS officer got killed, sometimes they would kill thousands
[02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:12.140]  in retribution, that is authoritarianism, now let's see if my math's right, they looked
[02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:18.980]  it up, 21 million lived in the northern states and 9 million in the south, 3.5 million were
[02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:24.580]  slaves so that means about 6 million and 5.5 million, so I was right, it's about a third,
[02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:31.100]  so there you go, my memory's served, but let me just get back to this, just showing folks
[02:39:31.100 --> 02:39:34.300]  I don't just make this stuff up, I mean I'm doing this right here, this isn't some rigged
[02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:37.460]  pre deal where I say check this, I just go out the fly from my memory and see if my memory
[02:39:37.460 --> 02:39:45.060]  still works, it's like a memory game, the point is is that almost no one alive in this
[02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:50.380]  country has almost anybody that owns slaves and seven generations back, what planet are
[02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:57.820]  you on where you say that my neighbor, a guy down the street shoots a cop in Nazi Germany,
[02:39:57.820 --> 02:40:06.700]  I get sent to a concentration camp, that's an America and under jurisprudence and under
[02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:14.220]  English common law, you're guilty for what you do, not what somebody else does, that's
[02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:22.260]  like saying of a black man's grandfather robbed a bank and shot the teller in 1952 that that
[02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:30.340]  grandson of that guy has to pay reparations to the woman's grandkids that got shot, that's
[02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:37.980]  just crazy, but beat ol' Rourke, he's on TV in between saying the world's gonna end in
[02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:46.820]  12 years like AOC saying we need to pay reparations to black people, that's how desperate the
[02:40:46.820 --> 02:40:55.100]  Democratic Party is just unbelievable, so let's go ahead and roll this clip here does.
[02:40:55.100 --> 02:41:05.780]  Your fellow Texan, Sheila Jackson Lee, has proposed a commission to study reparations,
[02:41:05.780 --> 02:41:13.820]  if that passes and you are president of the United States would you sign that bill?
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:19.660]  Yes, I had a chance to speak with and just listen to and learn from Brian Stevenson in
[02:41:19.660 --> 02:41:26.700]  Montgomery Alabama and learn from his work on working with the community to build a memorial
[02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:29.140]  to justice and to peace.
[02:41:29.140 --> 02:41:36.700]  Can you imagine the legal ease of saying the genetic testing, trying to find who had a
[02:41:36.700 --> 02:41:45.100]  background and then who pays what, I mean that is crazy and again, if your daddy killed
[02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:50.460]  somebody, you're to blame now because once you start saying sins are the forefathers
[02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:54.980]  and you've got to pay for them, this is the most destructive crap I've ever heard of,
[02:41:54.980 --> 02:41:55.980]  let's go back to it.
[02:41:55.980 --> 02:42:01.100]  He said foundational to reparations is the word repair, foundational to repair is the
[02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:06.220]  truth and until all Americans understand that civil rights are not just those victories
[02:42:06.220 --> 02:42:15.100]  you're that weird little weird jive talk, weird code, weird NLP about situational repair,
[02:42:15.100 --> 02:42:19.380]  truth, jibber jubber because it's just a giant con game.
[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:26.060]  He's telling you your newborn baby owes somebody money when you're not, when you weren't even
[02:42:26.060 --> 02:42:35.740]  on this damn continent when your great-great-granddaddy came here.
[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:40.540]  It's the craziest thing I've ever heard of, but welcome to America man, welcome to the
[02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:41.540]  left.
[02:42:41.540 --> 02:42:45.620]  Chris, Jeff, Grant, Max, Bob, Liberty Smith and others, your calls are just a few minutes
[02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:55.420]  away but whatever you do, spread those links to newswars.com, newswars.com, newswars.com.
[02:42:55.420 --> 02:42:57.340]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:57.340 --> 02:42:58.340]  Go ahead.
[02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:02.540]  Yeah, I just have to say something man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast
[02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:05.900]  you're bragging, it just gets old man.
[02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:07.940]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:07.940 --> 02:43:10.180]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:14.740]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:16.860]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:20.100]  If that was happening to anybody else I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:22.660]  I mean what's it going to take us being shut down?
[02:43:22.660 --> 02:43:23.660]  Is that what you want Frank?
[02:43:23.660 --> 02:43:24.660]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:25.660]  I'll take it.
[02:43:25.660 --> 02:43:26.660]  I'll put him on pause again.
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:31.180]  Hey Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[02:43:31.180 --> 02:43:33.060]  under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:37.420]  As much bragging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:40.380]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:42.660]  Do you understand I need your help Frank?
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:44.940]  I need your help Frank.

[02:45:57.020 --> 02:46:01.100]  I want to say brain force is great, I want to say turbo force is amazing, it is.
[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:05.900]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:09.140]  The fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:14.700]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:18.260]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil, if you're
[02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:21.540]  going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong, they
[02:46:21.540 --> 02:46:25.340]  don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps
[02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:28.260]  and I'm just sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:32.460]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view, I'm not making a medical statement
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:36.020]  here but let me tell you something, I eat five canthulets of krill oil before I go to
[02:46:36.020 --> 02:46:39.860]  bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:46:39.860 --> 02:46:47.340]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:50.780]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:59.500]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:11.620]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:47:40.140]  a great talk show host, he's taking over 15 after, but I'm going to go to at
[02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:46.220]  least 15 of these calls, Brent and Thomas and Doug and Kevin and Matt and Raymond and
[02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:49.900]  Liberty Smith, Bob, Max, Grant, Jeff, Chris and others.
[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:57.980]  A lot of the breaking news on infowars.com and newswars.com, but I'm not going to go
[02:47:57.980 --> 02:48:00.820]  to that yet until I've taken your phone calls.
[02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:04.140]  So let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:10.580]  Let's talk to Doug in Connecticut, a retired police officer on the so-called drag queen
[02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:16.820]  topic, convicted pedophiles, child rapists in disguises like demon clowns, being given
[02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:22.740]  access to your children all over the Western world following a coordinated script.
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:25.700]  What do you think's really going on here, Doug?
[02:48:25.700 --> 02:48:31.620]  Well, Alex, to me, it's an obvious, one of the most sickest attempts at gaining access
[02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:37.380]  to our children, other than possibly physically grabbing them in Hollywood and doing their
[02:48:37.380 --> 02:48:42.660]  will with them and, you know, like that, and, you know, I have four kids in school right
[02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:46.900]  up the street and I'm home and I'm retired and talking about God forbid something like
[02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:50.980]  that happens at the school, I'll be there in seconds and I just kind of wanted to get,
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:55.780]  I don't know, a message to the president that countrywide all law enforcement, if they haven't
[02:48:55.780 --> 02:49:01.500]  heard about this, needs to get a bulletin on this and obviously it's absolutely illegal.
[02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:04.740]  You know, all states have different wording to their laws, but it's impairing the morals
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:10.740]  of a minor, it's risk of injury and everybody involved in getting that drag queen to that
[02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:13.140]  school needs to be held accountable.
[02:49:13.140 --> 02:49:18.740]  The teacher, the principal, the drag queen itself and all the way up to the top drag
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:23.860]  queen or king, whatever they are, you know, you know, a former officer at great points
[02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:26.860]  you're making to pay on the state laws.
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:32.660]  I noticed two guys in one group in Houston raped six year old boys separately in different
[02:49:32.660 --> 02:49:33.660]  cases.
[02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:37.660]  We have their records are on emplowers.com, thanks investigators.
[02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:38.900]  Normally that'd be a big deal.
[02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:40.940]  Where are the arrests for the violating parole?
[02:49:40.940 --> 02:49:42.740]  They're both still on parole.
[02:49:42.740 --> 02:49:44.900]  Why is what's wrong with Houston?
[02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:49.740]  Well, you got somebody up towards the top and in the middle, that's corrupt in your
[02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:50.740]  courts.
[02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:54.580]  You know, I worked directly with the courts of the cop and, you know, you get your state's
[02:49:54.580 --> 02:49:58.980]  attorneys in there and your prosecutors and a lot of judges, once they gain their role,
[02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:03.020]  they lose their balls, as I've heard from many prosecutors and I had a case where I
[02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:07.140]  was almost murdered in line of duty and the guy dropped almost everything.
[02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:11.940]  So I've seen it firsthand and I worked in a crime and let's be honest, why is the left
[02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:13.940]  so out of the criminals?
[02:50:13.940 --> 02:50:16.020]  Because they are criminals.
[02:50:16.020 --> 02:50:19.940]  And I think the reason they're so petrified of Trump is he's going to, he's attempting
[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:26.100]  and will shut down a worldwide thousands year long, probably criminal enterprise.
[02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:27.100]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:30.820]  I've got all this mainstream news about the Islamists with the UN bringing in hundreds
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.740]  of thousands of sex slaves.
[02:50:32.740 --> 02:50:35.420]  I mean, it's just exploding the criminal activity.
[02:50:35.420 --> 02:50:40.380]  And it's been their way of life since before you and I were on the planet and now it's
[02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:46.180]  coming to an end and they're kicking and screaming and wiping feces on the walls trying to, they're
[02:50:46.180 --> 02:50:47.180]  not going to know what else to do.
[02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:49.340]  They're not going to be employable after this.
[02:50:49.340 --> 02:50:52.020]  And you, when you look at these, you know, Satan's supposed to be some ugly demonic
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:53.020]  little twerp.
[02:50:53.020 --> 02:50:54.020]  And I mean, look at Blumenthal.
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:50:55.020]  I'm from Connecticut.
[02:50:55.020 --> 02:50:56.020]  I had the spies, Blumenthal.
[02:50:56.020 --> 02:50:57.580]  I had the spies, Murphy.
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:03.860]  I sent him emails all the time and lose my train of thought, but they are the most disgusting
[02:51:03.860 --> 02:51:07.860]  repulsive people on this planet and their days are numbered.
[02:51:07.860 --> 02:51:09.500]  And I know you don't follow Q and anything.
[02:51:09.500 --> 02:51:12.460]  I don't follow it that much, but I know for the fact that I've been, I've been told people
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:16.020]  nationwide that Blumenthal and Murphy are like as bad as you can get.
[02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:17.020]  That's all I've been told.
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:19.420]  I mean, the eyes are the window to the soul, right?
[02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:20.420]  To the window to the soul.
[02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:21.780]  So look at Murphy's eyes.
[02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:25.620]  That dude, remember when he went against Obama for trying to impose martial law around the
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:26.620]  world?
[02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:27.620]  Do you remember that?
[02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:29.660]  So what happened to that Chris Murphy?
[02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:34.140]  Like the next couple months, he was a completely different character and he has fear in those
[02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:35.140]  eyes, man.
[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:36.140]  He has fear.
[02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:37.380]  He's hiding something.
[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:38.380]  He's compromised.
[02:51:38.380 --> 02:51:41.500]  And Blumenthal just looks like a big ass demon.
[02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:47.580]  He looks like some HIV positive heroin addict or something that dude, he does look like
[02:51:47.580 --> 02:51:48.580]  a sick demon.
[02:51:48.580 --> 02:51:49.740]  I mean, they all have the same look.
[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:50.740]  You've mentioned it.
[02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:53.740]  They all have that sick look and they're scared.
[02:51:53.740 --> 02:51:58.140]  I know how everybody knows what a scared person looks like in the eyeballs and they're showing
[02:51:58.140 --> 02:51:59.140]  every side.
[02:51:59.140 --> 02:52:02.620]  I'm not bragging about this, but when Murphy or Blumenthal talk about me, they visibly
[02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:03.820]  look like they're scared.
[02:52:03.820 --> 02:52:04.820]  I like that.
[02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:05.820]  I like that.
[02:52:05.820 --> 02:52:08.860]  They should be scared, man, and one thing I was going to say about Q, he had a quote
[02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:12.900]  on there one time that said, there'll be a time when it is not safe for these people
[02:52:12.900 --> 02:52:14.140]  to walk the streets anymore.
[02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:15.780]  And I got to tell you what they're doing with kids.
[02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:16.780]  We know it.
[02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:17.780]  Oh, let me say this about Q.
[02:52:17.780 --> 02:52:23.540]  I got manipulated by somebody close to me that I'd learned was bad, the Q was bad.
[02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:27.260]  There's some fake Q's out there, but the main Q is right and I need to do a whole apology
[02:52:27.260 --> 02:52:31.900]  about it because what they said about Mueller starting to come true and I have to actually
[02:52:31.900 --> 02:52:32.900]  eat crow.
[02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:36.220]  I haven't figured out how to do it yet that a large part of it is accurate.
[02:52:36.220 --> 02:52:37.220]  Right.
[02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:42.060]  Well, it takes common sense and some work sometimes that decipher through to be asked
[02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:43.060]  to get to the core.
[02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:46.980]  You know, if people have the time and common sense, they can find it, but it's not safe
[02:52:46.980 --> 02:52:47.980]  for these people now.
[02:52:47.980 --> 02:52:52.140]  And one thing you say that I like is you don't need orders from headquarters.
[02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:58.620]  Well, a civilian, a parent or a legal guardian doesn't need the police in my eyes, being
[02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:03.220]  in the cop to go to the school and grab that drag queen and drag them out in the parking
[02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:05.500]  lot and dispose of them.
[02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:08.900]  If you're in that school and you're in kids and somebody's not stopping it, I should have
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:12.980]  the legal right to go in there and put you down and without repercussions.
[02:53:12.980 --> 02:53:16.660]  Well, the bottom line is we're going to run their plates and we're going to we're going
[02:53:16.660 --> 02:53:18.180]  to follow the law and we're going to get them.
[02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:19.820]  God bless you, Doug.
[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:22.500]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:24.540]  It's unbelievable.
[02:53:24.540 --> 02:53:30.420]  Not vampires aren't real folks, but the legends are off of this thing that happens where these
[02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:32.860]  people want to hurt kids.
[02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:36.420]  And you look at these so-called drag queens that are convicted pedophiles, their real
[02:53:36.420 --> 02:53:39.900]  outfit is like a demonic demon.
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:43.460]  And if we don't protect our kids from them, who are we?
[02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:58.660]  We've got major governors passing and trying to pass laws to kill babies after they're
[02:53:58.660 --> 02:53:59.660]  born.
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:00.660]  Who should we go to next year?
[02:54:00.660 --> 02:54:02.020]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in California.
[02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:03.020]  Go ahead.
[02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:04.020]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:05.020]  Welcome.
[02:54:05.020 --> 02:54:13.420]  Hey, I want to start off by saying that I use all of your products.
[02:54:13.420 --> 02:54:14.980]  Thank you.
[02:54:14.980 --> 02:54:24.420]  I have your triple fours to your body, your Z-Field, SuperMail, Survival X2, Secret 12,
[02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:26.020]  Survival Shield X3.
[02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:27.020]  I have them all.
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:28.580]  Thank you.
[02:54:28.580 --> 02:54:35.220]  I have, you know, also I have bone cancer that was diagnosed three and a half years
[02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:43.740]  ago, and I bombard my doctor with all the rhetoric that the system wants to throw at
[02:54:43.740 --> 02:54:49.540]  us, you know, diet, injections, and injunction will combine from a very early age to produce
[02:54:49.540 --> 02:54:55.020]  a sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authority is considered desirable
[02:54:55.020 --> 02:55:02.340]  and any serious criticism of the powers to be psychologically impossible, even if all
[02:55:02.340 --> 02:55:08.140]  people are miserable, all will believe themselves happy because the government will tell them
[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:09.140]  that.
[02:55:09.140 --> 02:55:12.220]  Yeah, you're paraphrasing Bertrand Russell.
[02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:13.220]  I am.
[02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:14.220]  Absolutely.
[02:55:14.220 --> 02:55:21.340]  And I hit them with that all the time, but I hit them with the eugenics boards.
[02:55:21.340 --> 02:55:26.420]  I hit them with all the trash and garbage that they throw at us every day and turn on
[02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:32.620]  the TV and every other commercial is an advertisement from some big pharma trying to push a new
[02:55:32.620 --> 02:55:37.460]  drug on society and then immediately following that advertisement is another advertisement
[02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:43.060]  from a law firm that's suing the very drug company for a drug that they pushed on everybody
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:45.340]  10 years prior.
[02:55:45.340 --> 02:55:47.220]  It's ridiculous.
[02:55:47.220 --> 02:55:51.580]  I can't imagine why people don't see through all this garbage and they tell you the side
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:56.620]  effects and see vaccine makers in 84 are made immune, they don't show side effects.
[02:55:56.620 --> 02:56:00.780]  Although the drug makers admit the bad stuff it can do to you, but vaccine makers, it's
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:05.300]  all hidden, but it's still admitted on the vaccine insert and we try to cover it and
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:06.740]  they go, oh, ban that.
[02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:07.900]  That's medical disinfo.
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:13.100]  So now as consumers, we can't tell you a vaccine almost killed us just like the insert says
[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:14.100]  it might.
[02:56:14.100 --> 02:56:15.100]  God bless you.
[02:56:15.100 --> 02:56:16.100]  You can hear from me, Kevin.
[02:56:16.100 --> 02:56:19.420]  Let's go to Jeff in Canada.
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:20.420]  You're on the air.
[02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:24.940]  Hey, Alex, welcome.
[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:30.660]  You know, I'm really, you know, thankful that you carry the information that you do because
[02:56:30.660 --> 02:56:36.820]  you just don't get it anywhere else in the point in breakdown that you do and I think,
[02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:41.660]  you know, there's no way to overestimate what's going on with what's happening with
[02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:42.660]  children.
[02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:46.140]  That's the exact, the entire cult is about sucking their energy.
[02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:49.580]  Whatever this thing is, it wants kids and what does the Bible tell us?
[02:56:49.580 --> 02:56:51.820]  The devil wants to hurt kids.
[02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:52.820]  Exactly.
[02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:58.460]  And, you know, if this has been done at the level of governors and high level people and
[02:56:58.460 --> 02:57:04.620]  it's being, you know, run through the system, my question is, is who is really greenlighting
[02:57:04.620 --> 02:57:05.620]  this?
[02:57:05.620 --> 02:57:08.820]  And, and I've been, I've been studying something called the Noah Hyde Law.
[02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:09.820]  I don't know.
[02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:13.020]  I've never heard you talk about it, but I'll tell you that thing is evil.
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:19.780]  And what it is is globalist Jews, Islamists and Catholics merging together the Abrahamic
[02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:27.100]  faith and coming up with a, basically a BS law to outlaw Christianity and they're all
[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:28.100]  greenlight pedophilia.
[02:57:28.100 --> 02:57:35.380]  I mean, in the Talmud, it says you can sleep with a three year old girl, Islam, you know,
[02:57:35.380 --> 02:57:37.700]  we know what Islam, we know about the Catholic stuff.
[02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:42.140]  Well, I've heard about Noah Hyde Law, at least it was like seven day evidence put out, but
[02:57:42.140 --> 02:57:44.180]  I want to hear about this when we come back.
[02:57:44.180 --> 02:57:45.180]  Stay there.
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:47.620]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:49.340]  There is no set stasis.
[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:50.580]  There is no managed system.
[02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:51.580]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:55.420]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[02:57:55.420 --> 02:57:58.740]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:57:58.740 --> 02:58:00.820]  We won't just be here a hundred years, we'll be here forever.
[02:58:00.820 --> 02:58:02.020]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:58:02.020 --> 02:58:06.860]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and
[02:58:06.860 --> 02:58:09.580]  say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:11.180]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:13.540]  But yeah, God's got a big war for you ready.
[02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:17.180]  And so if you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao
[02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:20.700]  Seitang, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:58:20.700 --> 02:58:24.940]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also
[02:58:24.940 --> 02:58:25.940]  ready to fight.
[02:58:25.940 --> 02:58:28.540]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:58:28.540 --> 02:58:30.500]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:58:30.500 --> 02:58:34.180]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:58:34.180 --> 02:58:35.340]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:58:35.340 --> 02:58:39.940]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshipers.
[02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:42.620]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:58:42.620 --> 02:58:43.740]  I want life.
[02:58:43.740 --> 02:58:46.660]  I want Jesus.
[02:58:46.660 --> 02:58:49.220]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:58:49.220 --> 02:58:54.580]  Work, family, friends and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your
[02:58:54.580 --> 02:58:55.580]  mood.
[02:58:55.580 --> 02:58:57.380]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:20.940]  All right, Jeff in Canada, and we're going to go to Zach from Morocco, frequent caller,
[03:00:20.940 --> 03:00:23.260]  hadn't called in about three or four months.
[03:00:23.260 --> 03:00:24.260]  Always informative.
[03:00:24.260 --> 03:00:27.780]  Jeff in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:36.980]  So I brought up the Nohide Law, that's N-O-A-H-I-D-E law, and that was signed into law by George
[03:00:36.980 --> 03:00:41.460]  Herbert Walker Bush in 1991.
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:45.460]  Not a lot of people know about this, but apparently since then all 50 states have signed
[03:00:45.460 --> 03:00:47.100]  on to it.
[03:00:47.100 --> 03:00:54.540]  And my concern with it is, first off, there's a blasphemy law in there, which if you run
[03:00:54.540 --> 03:01:01.340]  the table on what it all means is it's outlawing belief in Jesus and is punishable by beheading
[03:01:01.340 --> 03:01:02.340]  of all things.
[03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:08.500]  Well, I know there's a big UN move to unify all the religions and it's all anti-Christian.
[03:01:08.500 --> 03:01:09.500]  God bless you.
[03:01:09.500 --> 03:01:10.500]  I appreciate your call.
[03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:11.500]  Now let's go ahead.
[03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:15.700]  I was about to go to Zach, but it looked like he just hung up.
[03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:20.500]  So let's go ahead and talk to Grant in Iowa, Grant, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:25.260]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:29.820]  Going back to the drag queen deal, you know, we've talked about this before, you've talked
[03:01:29.820 --> 03:01:32.460]  about this before, I've talked to Owen about it.
[03:01:32.460 --> 03:01:37.220]  These people embrace the dark, they ignore the truth, they don't have the drive to seek
[03:01:37.220 --> 03:01:40.740]  it out like we do, and like you said, they're just vessels.
[03:01:40.740 --> 03:01:45.100]  They're being passive, which leads them to being led by the devil toward the darkness,
[03:01:45.100 --> 03:01:50.140]  which is obviously clearly and obviously encouraged by technology in the media in Hollywood, and
[03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:55.020]  all the automated instant gratifying zero patient system that they've built.
[03:01:55.020 --> 03:01:58.740]  Imagine being these mothers, mainly, taking your children, in some cases they don't ask
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:02.940]  us at the elementary school, and giving them the convicted pedophiles to sit on their lap,
[03:02:02.940 --> 03:02:07.340]  and the women look totally whacked out their minds.
[03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:13.660]  I mean, it's hard to even imagine, you know, because I'm not a crazy person, but, you know,
[03:02:13.660 --> 03:02:17.020]  a lot of people are just aren't engaged in politics and don't know what's going on.
[03:02:17.020 --> 03:02:21.340]  I feel like having your head in the sand is some ways just as bad as actively participating
[03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:22.340]  in the deception.
[03:02:22.340 --> 03:02:23.340]  Oh, I agree.
[03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:27.100]  You know, we have to put effort into finding the light and finding the truth, versus they
[03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:33.180]  just get to slack off and sit around vacuously staring into their imperial probe droids.
[03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:36.460]  And the other awfully terrible point you made earlier, you know, think of the crimes that
[03:02:36.460 --> 03:02:39.700]  these people aren't caught for.
[03:02:39.700 --> 03:02:44.020]  It's just like at the border when you encounter and apprehend 100,000 illegal border crossers
[03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:48.660]  in the month of March, there's two or 300,000 more that you didn't encounter nor apprehend.
[03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:56.460]  Or way more than that, some sectors have reported 13 to 15,000 a day.
[03:02:56.460 --> 03:02:57.460]  It's overwhelming.
[03:02:57.460 --> 03:02:58.660]  You know, something has to be done.
[03:02:58.660 --> 03:02:59.660]  We can't do that.
[03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:03.540]  And they're smuggling kids and they admit they are, but nobody cares about those kids.
[03:03:03.540 --> 03:03:04.540]  No.
[03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:08.460]  And we have to stop being afraid of economic woes and the cost of children when we're already
[03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:11.180]  paying for so many other people's kids.
[03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:12.580]  The middle class is under attack.
[03:03:12.580 --> 03:03:14.460]  We have to get back to replacement rate.
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:16.420]  You've been warning about this for years.
[03:03:16.420 --> 03:03:20.540]  We have to fight back and raise real children with real brains instead of letting the Apple
[03:03:20.540 --> 03:03:22.620]  computer chip raise them.
[03:03:22.620 --> 03:03:26.340]  And it was a really dark segment when you went over that stuff last hour.
[03:03:26.340 --> 03:03:30.980]  You know, I go to the mall, I go to campus, I go almost anywhere in public and I can feel
[03:03:30.980 --> 03:03:35.940]  that darkness around me, the emptiness, the place where the humanity should be.
[03:03:35.940 --> 03:03:39.220]  It's different if you're at like a basketball game or a rock concert because at least people
[03:03:39.220 --> 03:03:42.940]  are engaged in something tangible and they're doing something together, which makes us feel
[03:03:42.940 --> 03:03:43.940]  alive.
[03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:47.940]  But we shouldn't have to go to sporting events just to get that connection with others.
[03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:52.940]  Just like Doug from Connecticut said, the eyes are absolutely the window to the soul
[03:03:52.940 --> 03:03:56.420]  and you can look at these people and look at Schiff when he's lying to you on national
[03:03:56.420 --> 03:04:00.780]  television over and over and you can see that they know that they're trying to deceive.
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:01.780]  They're not.
[03:04:01.780 --> 03:04:02.780]  They're not.
[03:04:02.780 --> 03:04:03.780]  Well, that's right.
[03:04:03.780 --> 03:04:07.100]  Politically and economically and culturally, you know, he's a liar, but also just looking
[03:04:07.100 --> 03:04:09.980]  at him and you're like, that's the bad guy.
[03:04:09.980 --> 03:04:11.700]  That is a sack of garbage.
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:18.900]  That is a lying deceiver on a power trip trying to hype himself up to look credible.
[03:04:18.900 --> 03:04:22.500]  You got to trust your God on these things like you've said before.
[03:04:22.500 --> 03:04:26.420]  My last little idea, you didn't take a lot of calls this week, but you guys should do
[03:04:26.420 --> 03:04:29.860]  a Joe Biden hair shampoo commercial.
[03:04:29.860 --> 03:04:30.860]  Be pretty hilarious.
[03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:31.860]  I think.
[03:04:31.860 --> 03:04:32.860]  How do we do it?
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:37.140]  Well, you know, just you could do like a shampoo commercial where you're like, oh, look, our
[03:04:37.140 --> 03:04:40.780]  shampoo smells so fresh and then have Joe, you know, cut to him smelling all the hair
[03:04:40.780 --> 03:04:42.060]  and be like, Joe loves it.
[03:04:42.060 --> 03:04:43.500]  No, I totally agree.
[03:04:43.500 --> 03:04:44.500]  That's it.
[03:04:44.500 --> 03:04:48.980]  I knew the voiceover like, and now Vida also soon rolls out its new product sponsored
[03:04:48.980 --> 03:04:54.420]  by our newest star, Joe Biden.
[03:04:54.420 --> 03:04:59.460]  And now through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[03:04:59.460 --> 03:05:02.380]  So far it matches any other special we've ever done.

[03:06:17.860 --> 03:06:26.860]  Imagine, you got a neighbor you've done for 10 years, came over and played chess every
[03:06:26.860 --> 03:06:33.700]  month, had barbecues, came over, but one time you've got some small children and you got
[03:06:33.700 --> 03:06:37.940]  a pool party going on at your house and you walk out in the back grilling hamburgers and
[03:06:37.940 --> 03:06:44.940]  there's Bob or David or William or whatever his name is and he's got your 7-year-old daughter
[03:06:44.940 --> 03:06:50.660]  sitting on his lap and he's rubbing her butt and he says, you want to touch my beard?
[03:06:50.660 --> 03:06:51.660]  You like that?
[03:06:51.660 --> 03:06:52.660]  You could be a boy.
[03:06:52.660 --> 03:06:53.660]  You could be a girl.
[03:06:53.660 --> 03:06:55.940]  You could shake your booty.
[03:06:55.940 --> 03:07:01.180]  You'd say, Bob, get your ass out of here and you'd probably move not to live next door
[03:07:01.180 --> 03:07:07.740]  to Bob, but that goes on in public and they won't even ask in many cities where they have
[03:07:07.740 --> 03:07:14.180]  your elementary school students sit on their freakish laps and they tell you, we're getting
[03:07:14.180 --> 03:07:20.580]  your kids and you put up with that.
[03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:36.020]  It's sick, it's demonic and it's real, but here's the thing, raping kids is still illegal
[03:07:36.020 --> 03:07:40.540]  and so all over the country, people are going to these events that are around their backgrounds
[03:07:40.540 --> 03:07:45.020]  and these men who think their disguise are being exposed, so I salute everybody that's
[03:07:45.020 --> 03:07:46.020]  doing that.
[03:07:46.020 --> 03:07:48.020]  I want you to keep it up.
[03:07:48.020 --> 03:07:54.700]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[03:07:54.700 --> 03:07:57.980]  Let's go ahead and talk to Liberty Smith in Oklahoma.
[03:07:57.980 --> 03:07:58.980]  You're on the air.
[03:07:58.980 --> 03:07:59.980]  Welcome.
[03:07:59.980 --> 03:08:00.980]  Are you there?
[03:08:00.980 --> 03:08:01.980]  Yes, sir.
[03:08:01.980 --> 03:08:06.780]  Use pearl for the smell, how about that?
[03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:10.660]  A little distorted audio, but go ahead.
[03:08:10.660 --> 03:08:16.780]  Oh, I just, for the meme on the Biden thing, use pearl for the smell.
[03:08:16.780 --> 03:08:20.900]  Pearl for the smell, smells like tyranny, yeah.
[03:08:20.900 --> 03:08:27.940]  Yeah, anyway, I agree with all those colleagues that have called just recently, Alex, so I'm
[03:08:27.940 --> 03:08:29.740]  not going to bother you with all that.
[03:08:29.740 --> 03:08:35.420]  All I'm going to say is, I have some personal reasons, which I have no problem telling you
[03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:40.300]  off there, but these pedophiles need to go down, Alex.
[03:08:40.300 --> 03:08:43.940]  I mean, enough's enough, and I want to be part of that.
[03:08:43.940 --> 03:08:50.100]  I'm a 62-year-old man, I have a son your age, I got 12 grandchildren, enough's enough,
[03:08:50.100 --> 03:08:51.100]  man.
[03:08:51.100 --> 03:08:56.980]  I mean, it's an emotional thing for me, just as many other things are, but this particular
[03:08:56.980 --> 03:09:00.460]  one should piss any man off.
[03:09:00.460 --> 03:09:01.980]  I mean, enough's enough.
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:07.020]  They go, fat pedophiles want to bounce your granddaughter on their knee, yeah, or all
[03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:10.380]  these perverts want to go meet with your kids, they're like, we're going to meet with your
[03:09:10.380 --> 03:09:16.500]  kids, and the left's going to let us, because we, your kids are ours.
[03:09:16.500 --> 03:09:21.700]  I know, and it's crazy, and I just can't see why anybody would even put up with it.
[03:09:21.700 --> 03:09:26.860]  And like I said, I've got personal reasons, but I want to be part of it in any way, shape,
[03:09:26.860 --> 03:09:30.700]  or form, taking these demonic pedophiles down.
[03:09:30.700 --> 03:09:35.980]  I mean, it's a button point for me as far as I'm concerned, and any man should be.
[03:09:35.980 --> 03:09:40.940]  God, it's so creepy, man, convicted child rapist, dress-upist women at government-sponsored
[03:09:40.940 --> 03:09:43.260]  events, and the mayor says, we're going to keep doing it.
[03:09:43.260 --> 03:09:46.460]  I think that mayor's probably been compromised, Liberty Smith, thank you so much.
[03:09:46.460 --> 03:09:50.820]  Let's talk to Matt in California, the drag queen trans storytime.
[03:09:50.820 --> 03:09:51.820]  Go ahead.
[03:09:51.820 --> 03:09:54.220]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:09:54.220 --> 03:09:55.220]  Thank you, I really appreciate it.
[03:09:55.220 --> 03:09:56.220]  Thank you.
[03:09:56.220 --> 03:09:59.380]  Just real quick, I've purchased a lot of your products, I won't go through the entire list,
[03:09:59.380 --> 03:10:02.660]  it's just about everything that everyone else, that too, I've got them, and still holding
[03:10:02.660 --> 03:10:05.860]  on tight to my Hillary for prison shirt.
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:12.020]  But yeah, in Long Beach, California, I was surprised when I heard too that that happened
[03:10:12.020 --> 03:10:16.980]  here at the Michelle Obama Library, it was that one that had the giant white horns with
[03:10:16.980 --> 03:10:19.180]  the red tips on it, that crazy psycho.
[03:10:19.180 --> 03:10:23.820]  Yeah, it was the man dressed like a Pokemon demon, yeah.
[03:10:23.820 --> 03:10:24.820]  Exactly.
[03:10:24.820 --> 03:10:30.660]  And it's just like the last caller, that shit upset every man, father, grandfather,
[03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:35.620]  brother, that these people are out there, and they need to be stopped.
[03:10:35.620 --> 03:10:40.380]  I mean, it's almost like, if you caught one, it would just be like, I'd be standing there
[03:10:40.380 --> 03:10:44.740]  just like Marcellus Wallace, you know, Pulp Fiction with that, you know, just like, these
[03:10:44.740 --> 03:10:45.740]  guys are done.
[03:10:45.740 --> 03:10:49.980]  I mean, and I pull on support you guys, thank you so much.
[03:10:49.980 --> 03:10:53.780]  Don't thank me, brother, we're doing this, this is a common sense, survival, please don't
[03:10:53.780 --> 03:10:56.140]  thank me for coming up for oxygen, Matt, God bless you.
[03:10:56.140 --> 03:10:59.220]  Yeah, it's, it's, look, this is their plan.
[03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:03.380]  The globalists are obsessed with the flesh and hurting children, whether it's killing
[03:11:03.380 --> 03:11:06.460]  them after they're born for their organs, or whether it's putting them on drugs, or
[03:11:06.460 --> 03:11:12.260]  whether it's raping them, that's the left's religion.
[03:11:12.260 --> 03:11:16.060]  They're the left, they're the left hand path, what does the left do, everybody knows what
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:17.060]  they do.
[03:11:17.060 --> 03:11:20.260]  Let's talk to Max in Wisconsin, you're on the air, welcome.
[03:11:20.260 --> 03:11:21.260]  Hi, Mr.
[03:11:21.260 --> 03:11:28.700]  Head of a Curve, Mr. Van Helsing, first of all, with the previous caller, if they really
[03:11:28.700 --> 03:11:35.300]  want to help out with getting not only this issue, but other issues, they should flood
[03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:40.620]  you with cash, you know, you're the most biggest guy in this right now.
[03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:44.860]  Well, we're fighting hard, they got the dark side suing us, and their poor victims are
[03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:47.660]  using, but we're fighting hard, people have been supporting us, so yes, thank you, brother.
[03:11:47.660 --> 03:11:50.500]  But I mean, again, people keep saying me, this is what you're supposed to do.
[03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:55.860]  I mean, I've got children too, but so what's your take on the ancient history of vampires?
[03:11:55.860 --> 03:12:04.500]  Well, the word vampire is the word vampire, it's from the Balkan region, and it's very
[03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:06.500]  ancient problem.
[03:12:06.500 --> 03:12:12.300]  There's been, they weren't able to solve it back then, and it would always pop up again.
[03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:23.460]  Some believed it was a Psyop to psych out the manly Spartan-like and soldiers in the area.
[03:12:23.460 --> 03:12:31.140]  Others believed that there was in the ground heavy metals that contaminated the well water,
[03:12:31.140 --> 03:12:37.700]  even radioactive elements that caused like Mad Hatter syndrome, but it's never been solved.
[03:12:37.700 --> 03:12:48.620]  And I think it's an issue, which is testing from God, the human element, and we're being
[03:12:48.620 --> 03:12:49.620]  tested.
[03:12:49.620 --> 03:12:50.620]  By the way, you're not just saying this.
[03:12:50.620 --> 03:12:53.420]  Actually, I researched this, it was in old history books.
[03:12:53.420 --> 03:12:57.580]  Greece had a problem with vampires, Russia did, the Balkans, as you said, big problems,
[03:12:57.580 --> 03:12:58.740]  Transylvania.
[03:12:58.740 --> 03:13:03.340]  People wouldn't let their kids out at night because people grabbed them and eat them.
[03:13:03.340 --> 03:13:14.100]  And another big issue was that at the time when there was hunting parties, as you discussed,
[03:13:14.100 --> 03:13:21.060]  as you recall in folklore, they could go into hibernation for extended periods of times
[03:13:21.060 --> 03:13:22.060]  in coffin.
[03:13:22.060 --> 03:13:29.660]  You know, we've all seen and heard those stories, movies, etc., but I still think people should
[03:13:29.660 --> 03:13:34.260]  just flood you with cash, just load you up, sorrow, great money, you know, you should
[03:13:34.260 --> 03:13:36.180]  have as much money as sorrow right now.
[03:13:36.180 --> 03:13:39.900]  Well, believe me, I'm actually drooling, not for the money, but for what I can do with
[03:13:39.900 --> 03:13:40.900]  it.
[03:13:40.900 --> 03:13:41.900]  Absolutely.
[03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:44.940]  People will just buy the products and just sign up for auto-ship and just do it.
[03:13:44.940 --> 03:13:49.780]  Because, I mean, we're nipping, talking, I want to be way ahead to expand things, but
[03:13:49.780 --> 03:13:53.260]  regardless, God keeps coming through and I thank you so much, Max.
[03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:59.340]  And again, I don't go down this vampire road lightly.
[03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:00.860]  They're not literal vampires.
[03:14:00.860 --> 03:14:03.100]  They don't live forever.
[03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:07.580]  But they're promised that by their God and they think they are and the spirit we're dealing
[03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:08.580]  with is very old.
[03:14:08.580 --> 03:14:11.900]  And the thing is, it jumps from person to person, so that's where you get the thing
[03:14:11.900 --> 03:14:13.700]  of like, it doesn't die.
[03:14:13.700 --> 03:14:17.900]  You can kill the vampire, the possessed person that just keeps coming back.
[03:14:17.900 --> 03:14:22.460]  And they always put clown makeup on, if you actually read the older histories in Greece
[03:14:22.460 --> 03:14:27.220]  or in the Balkans or even Japan, people would put makeup on, they go out and they just grab
[03:14:27.220 --> 03:14:31.540]  women and kids and like suck their blood and you're like, well, those are psychotics, exactly.
[03:14:31.540 --> 03:14:35.500]  So there's a certain thing happens, especially in cities and civilizations, where you get
[03:14:35.500 --> 03:14:39.340]  psychotics that lust after children's blood, which means the essence.
[03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:41.500]  It means they can rape them, they can kill them.
[03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:45.340]  Whatever it is, they want to terrorize them, like monster school or whatever.
[03:14:45.340 --> 03:14:50.620]  I've seen that movie, what is it, Monsters Academy, where the ghosts get power off scaring
[03:14:50.620 --> 03:14:51.620]  kids.
[03:14:51.620 --> 03:14:53.660]  And they're kind of telling you what they're doing right there.
[03:14:53.660 --> 03:14:59.020]  Now, I said, Mr. Pappard, he does a great job, manages one of our great TV affiliates,
[03:14:59.020 --> 03:15:02.740]  is about to take over, and I really appreciate the great job he does once a week.
[03:15:02.740 --> 03:15:03.940]  I want to get him his own show soon.
[03:15:03.940 --> 03:15:07.780]  We're trying to line that up and get it done, but I promised to finish your calls.
[03:15:07.780 --> 03:15:11.540]  So we come back and make four or five more calls, bam, bam, bam, fast, and then Tom
[03:15:11.540 --> 03:15:14.460]  Pappard's going to take over and all the great work he does.
[03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:19.420]  So look for that, but I didn't even plug last hour, I'm going to plug this hour.
[03:15:19.420 --> 03:15:24.020]  Tried free shipping is about to end this weekend, it's got to end, I've got to come
[03:15:24.020 --> 03:15:25.740]  up with some new specials.

[03:15:40.780 --> 03:15:41.780]  game changers.

[03:17:21.820 --> 03:17:24.100]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.100 --> 03:17:28.020]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:28.020 --> 03:17:29.580]  I sued the IRS in one.
[03:17:29.580 --> 03:17:32.540]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.540 --> 03:17:35.820]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:17:35.820 --> 03:17:38.060]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.060 --> 03:17:39.380]  I can help you too.
[03:17:39.380 --> 03:17:42.380]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.380 --> 03:17:44.620]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.620 --> 03:17:54.340]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:54.340 --> 03:17:58.540]  The globalist, the eugenicist are always talking down to us.
[03:17:58.540 --> 03:18:03.220]  They're always trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant.
[03:18:03.220 --> 03:18:07.540]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access
[03:18:07.540 --> 03:18:11.140]  information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:18:11.140 --> 03:18:13.500]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:18:13.500 --> 03:18:19.940]  But the truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say and what
[03:18:19.940 --> 03:18:24.300]  we do that changes the world, we are the power structure.
[03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:25.900]  We are the inventors.
[03:18:25.900 --> 03:18:33.220]  We are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they understand that they
[03:18:33.220 --> 03:18:38.180]  are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[03:18:38.180 --> 03:18:42.900]  Now to help fund our operation is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists.
[03:18:42.900 --> 03:18:47.180]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half

[03:19:57.460 --> 03:20:21.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:35.860]  Tom Papert taking over here in just a few minutes, but I promised to knock these calls
[03:20:35.860 --> 03:20:36.860]  out.
[03:20:36.860 --> 03:20:40.260]  Bill in Kentucky, you're on the air worldwide, thanks for holding.
[03:20:40.260 --> 03:20:42.780]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[03:20:42.780 --> 03:20:48.340]  I'm kind of going to shift gears away from the basic topic, but it all has to do with
[03:20:48.340 --> 03:20:49.340]  the same thing.
[03:20:49.340 --> 03:20:51.580]  I've got a question for you.
[03:20:51.580 --> 03:21:01.140]  Why is it that Adam Schiff can constantly beat the pulpit that he's got evidence of
[03:21:01.140 --> 03:21:06.620]  problems with Trump, but yet why isn't he obstructing justice in saying that without
[03:21:06.620 --> 03:21:10.780]  being made to cough it up?
[03:21:10.780 --> 03:21:14.100]  Because they still think they control a lot of the agencies and he thinks corporate media
[03:21:14.100 --> 03:21:19.300]  will protect him and so a lot of Republican leaders think old corporate media has power
[03:21:19.300 --> 03:21:24.700]  so they've been basically bullied into submitting to him.
[03:21:24.700 --> 03:21:25.700]  It's all bluster.
[03:21:25.700 --> 03:21:30.140]  Well, you know, I still get back to the same old thing.
[03:21:30.140 --> 03:21:36.780]  The basics is that the devil is using his tool box manipulation, intimidation, and domination.
[03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:39.500]  If we can get that in our heads, I think we can deal with this.
[03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:41.660]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:21:41.660 --> 03:21:48.300]  Notice the Bible says the devil goes about roaring like a lion, not a lion, roaring like
[03:21:48.300 --> 03:21:51.580]  a lion, seeing who he can devour.
[03:21:51.580 --> 03:21:55.940]  And I used to always watch horror movies, didn't really like them, but like Friday 13th, where
[03:21:55.940 --> 03:21:59.140]  he's chasing the woman as she falls down and crawls on her back and doesn't fight back.
[03:21:59.140 --> 03:22:02.420]  I thought, well, that's not true because you or I would fight back.
[03:22:02.420 --> 03:22:03.420]  But it's true.
[03:22:03.420 --> 03:22:08.220]  A lot of people fall down and grovel to evil instead of fighting it so the devil looks
[03:22:08.220 --> 03:22:09.220]  for who he can devour.
[03:22:09.220 --> 03:22:10.220]  Does that make sense?
[03:22:10.220 --> 03:22:11.220]  Absolutely.
[03:22:11.220 --> 03:22:12.220]  Absolutely.
[03:22:12.220 --> 03:22:18.500]  Well, listen, I appreciate you taking my call and God bless and God speed.
[03:22:18.500 --> 03:22:22.420]  God bless you, Bill, for putting up with me because I babble a lot, but this is a great
[03:22:22.420 --> 03:22:25.100]  time to be alive and listen to all you guys is humbling.
[03:22:25.100 --> 03:22:29.940]  And again, I'm not saying they're literal vampires, but they're demonic and the spirit
[03:22:29.940 --> 03:22:33.900]  wants to hurt children because children are as close to God as you can get.
[03:22:33.900 --> 03:22:34.900]  They're made by God.
[03:22:34.900 --> 03:22:37.420]  They're in God's image and they haven't been corrupted yet.
[03:22:37.420 --> 03:22:43.260]  They're as close to the garden before Adam and Eve fell as you can get and the devil
[03:22:43.260 --> 03:22:46.420]  hates them and that's it.
[03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:51.140]  The devil hates God and a newborn baby is as close as you're going to get to God on this
[03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:54.540]  planet in the flesh.
[03:22:54.540 --> 03:22:56.540]  That's it.
[03:22:56.540 --> 03:23:01.780]  And when you realize that, you go, wow, this is heavy, but don't worry, the governor of
[03:23:01.780 --> 03:23:08.020]  Virginia is going to keep them healthy, keep them comfortable while he takes their levers.
[03:23:08.020 --> 03:23:09.020]  Brett in Alabama.
[03:23:09.020 --> 03:23:10.020]  You're on the air.
[03:23:10.020 --> 03:23:11.020]  Go ahead.
[03:23:11.020 --> 03:23:12.020]  Yes.
[03:23:12.020 --> 03:23:13.020]  Can you hear me?
[03:23:13.020 --> 03:23:14.020]  Yes, sir.
[03:23:14.020 --> 03:23:15.020]  Go ahead.
[03:23:15.020 --> 03:23:16.020]  So cool to talk to you.
[03:23:16.020 --> 03:23:17.020]  Alex, man.
[03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:18.020]  I'm almost giddy about it.
[03:23:18.020 --> 03:23:19.020]  I'm pleasure to talk to you, brother.
[03:23:19.020 --> 03:23:20.020]  What's on your mind?
[03:23:20.020 --> 03:23:25.420]  Well, listen, I promise you should plug your eye dime, man, because I had a very extraordinary
[03:23:25.420 --> 03:23:26.420]  experience with it.
[03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:29.860]  I was eating this Chinese joint, right?
[03:23:29.860 --> 03:23:33.820]  Very good food, man, best I ever had, but they had the seafood.
[03:23:33.820 --> 03:23:37.540]  And you know, it's that specific seafood, man, that Fukushima seafood.
[03:23:37.540 --> 03:23:40.300]  And I was eating it religiously every week.
[03:23:40.300 --> 03:23:44.180]  And anyways, I was just feeling terrible, like three days a week.
[03:23:44.180 --> 03:23:49.820]  And I mean, I'm a lean, healthy guy, workout, clean diet, all of that.
[03:23:49.820 --> 03:23:50.820]  But I still felt terrible.
[03:23:50.820 --> 03:23:52.980]  So I knew in my gut, man, I need to try the odd down.
[03:23:52.980 --> 03:23:53.980]  Well, anyway, I did.
[03:23:53.980 --> 03:23:59.660]  And after about two weeks, I went to sleep one night and slept harder than I ever have.
[03:23:59.660 --> 03:24:02.420]  And I woke up that next day feeling like a kid again.
[03:24:02.420 --> 03:24:07.060]  Like I'd never felt that good since I was a kid and I have everyday sense as long as
[03:24:07.060 --> 03:24:08.060]  I take it.
[03:24:08.060 --> 03:24:11.620]  But I'm like you, I'll get out of the habit of taking and I'll start feeling bad again.
[03:24:11.620 --> 03:24:12.860]  You just said it.
[03:24:12.860 --> 03:24:18.420]  I just told my wife, I said, honey, I'm not good at taking DNA force and X2 and the fish
[03:24:18.420 --> 03:24:19.420]  oil.
[03:24:19.420 --> 03:24:20.420]  I forget.
[03:24:20.420 --> 03:24:21.420]  Will you make me take it?
[03:24:21.420 --> 03:24:24.220]  Cause she's a big health nut and in great shape.
[03:24:24.220 --> 03:24:25.380]  And she said, yeah, I'll do it.
[03:24:25.380 --> 03:24:26.500]  So I'm the same way.
[03:24:26.500 --> 03:24:31.540]  I forget even though I do it for a month and feel great than I forget, you just said it.
[03:24:31.540 --> 03:24:34.740]  Our bodies are starving for good eye and eye and they're starving for what's in clean
[03:24:34.740 --> 03:24:35.740]  fish oil.
[03:24:35.740 --> 03:24:37.780]  They're starving for what's in DNA force.
[03:24:37.780 --> 03:24:42.860]  And like you said, if I take X2 every day for a week or two and don't forget the sleep
[03:24:42.860 --> 03:24:46.980]  is like when you're a kid, remember when you were a kid, it hurt to get up cause you slept
[03:24:46.980 --> 03:24:48.420]  so good.
[03:24:48.420 --> 03:24:53.140]  And that's what with X2 and things, you will have the sleep that hurts to get up.
[03:24:53.140 --> 03:24:58.180]  I remember like deer hunting when I was like nine years old, seven years old at four a.m.
[03:24:58.180 --> 03:25:00.180]  I got to cook breakfast, get up summer and cook breakfast.
[03:25:00.180 --> 03:25:04.180]  How bad it hurt to get up, but you think back, that's cause the sleep was so good.
[03:25:04.180 --> 03:25:09.420]  And I have sleep that hurts to get up when I take particularly the X2.
[03:25:09.420 --> 03:25:10.780]  That's a great way of putting it.
[03:25:10.780 --> 03:25:13.460]  I swear to God, this is the truth.
[03:25:13.460 --> 03:25:18.140]  A week ago I had dreams so hard and slept so good, but I took a bunch of X2 that I meant
[03:25:18.140 --> 03:25:20.980]  to come in here and talk about that deep sleep you get.
[03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:23.300]  And I guess it's just God working through things that you called in and talked about
[03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:24.300]  of it.
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:25.300]  You know what I'm talking about?
[03:25:25.300 --> 03:25:28.300]  Were you asleep so good you don't want to get up?
[03:25:28.300 --> 03:25:29.300]  Definitely.
[03:25:29.300 --> 03:25:30.300]  Definitely.
[03:25:30.300 --> 03:25:38.020]  Anyways, what I was calling to talk about was, I'm a few man, I'm on the zeitgeist.
[03:25:38.020 --> 03:25:41.180]  My fingers on the pulse man, I predicted Trump.
[03:25:41.180 --> 03:25:44.660]  I was trying to wage bets with people and everybody said Hillary was going to win.
[03:25:44.660 --> 03:25:46.940]  I mean I was on it.
[03:25:46.940 --> 03:25:52.500]  And when you ran that earlier about those pedophiles, man, and I've seen those two creeps,
[03:25:52.500 --> 03:25:56.380]  you know they were talking about bringing your kids to the screen, I felt it.
[03:25:56.380 --> 03:25:57.940]  I felt it in my gut.
[03:25:57.940 --> 03:26:00.780]  This is what the Bible warned us about.
[03:26:00.780 --> 03:26:02.780]  This is a big power.
[03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:04.580]  This is a big global force.
[03:26:04.580 --> 03:26:06.580]  This is the anti-crime.
[03:26:06.580 --> 03:26:08.460]  I mean this is the devil.
[03:26:08.460 --> 03:26:11.100]  And I can just feel it.
[03:26:11.100 --> 03:26:17.100]  I've never been so disgusted in my life about anything.
[03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:18.100]  No, I totally agree.
[03:26:18.100 --> 03:26:22.180]  And as bad as it is though, everything God told us is now being fulfilled, so how good
[03:26:22.180 --> 03:26:23.180]  is that?
[03:26:23.180 --> 03:26:27.260]  As bad as this is, Mark and the Beast, one-world government, they're coming for our kids.
[03:26:27.260 --> 03:26:32.060]  How good does it make it though to know that the revelations is true and that God's real?
[03:26:32.060 --> 03:26:37.460]  And cared about us so much that God would give us a cheat sheet to get out of this.
[03:26:37.460 --> 03:26:38.820]  It will make a believer out of you.
[03:26:38.820 --> 03:26:42.700]  I mean definitely, I mean because whether or not you believe in God, it's pretty apparent
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:26:44.860]  that Satan is real.
[03:26:44.860 --> 03:26:50.460]  This stuff couldn't be happening without a dark evil entity, you know, running the show.
[03:26:50.460 --> 03:26:51.700]  Oh, it's all coordinated.
[03:26:51.700 --> 03:26:53.700]  It's all coordinated.
[03:26:53.700 --> 03:26:54.700]  It's pretty clear.
[03:26:54.700 --> 03:26:55.700]  It's pretty obvious now.
[03:26:55.700 --> 03:27:01.180]  It doesn't take, you know, it doesn't take a conspiracy analyst like our ilk to figure
[03:27:01.180 --> 03:27:02.180]  it out.
[03:27:02.180 --> 03:27:04.580]  I mean, it's just clear now.
[03:27:04.580 --> 03:27:06.580]  And I just feel it.
[03:27:06.580 --> 03:27:07.580]  Just like righteous indignation.
[03:27:07.580 --> 03:27:11.420]  Well, you can feel the evil growing, but here's the thing.
[03:27:11.420 --> 03:27:12.420]  Good is growing.
[03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:14.860]  Every opposite, Newtonian physics.
[03:27:14.860 --> 03:27:16.900]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[03:27:16.900 --> 03:27:22.100]  So you feeling angry and upset and focused and you're discernment increasing is because
[03:27:22.100 --> 03:27:25.980]  as the devil comes into the world, God's going to come into the world through you.
[03:27:25.980 --> 03:27:29.620]  So as long as you just stay focused and reach out to others and tell the truth and follow
[03:27:29.620 --> 03:27:34.140]  what God's telling you to do, this is the great contest because God had to give us free
[03:27:34.140 --> 03:27:35.140]  will.
[03:27:35.140 --> 03:27:36.140]  People say, oh, God's a satist.
[03:27:36.140 --> 03:27:37.700]  God isn't a satist.
[03:27:37.700 --> 03:27:41.660]  God had to give us free will to be new independent creatures from him.
[03:27:41.660 --> 03:27:42.660]  That's heavy.
[03:27:42.660 --> 03:27:44.360]  And it's painful just like having children.
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:45.660]  You have children with your wife.
[03:27:45.660 --> 03:27:47.140]  They're going to face the whole world of things.
[03:27:47.140 --> 03:27:48.140]  They're going to go through adversity.
[03:27:48.140 --> 03:27:50.140]  They're going to probably get kids who are going to have a heart attack when they're
[03:27:50.140 --> 03:27:51.140]  old and die.
[03:27:51.140 --> 03:27:52.140]  Your own.
[03:27:52.140 --> 03:27:55.020]  He's like, well, I'm going to commit my kids, but that's part of life and that's part of
[03:27:55.020 --> 03:27:56.020]  the free will.
[03:27:56.020 --> 03:27:59.940]  And everything is what God does through us is God's work.
[03:27:59.940 --> 03:28:03.340]  And so you see the beauty and the mastery of it because the spirit doesn't die.
[03:28:03.340 --> 03:28:06.920]  And we're going to be with all those kids and our grandparents and everybody literally
[03:28:06.920 --> 03:28:07.920]  spiritually forever.
[03:28:07.920 --> 03:28:10.980]  We're going to break into that next level when we die and it's going to be we're going
[03:28:10.980 --> 03:28:18.180]  to thank God all day that God was willing to go through the pain to create his children
[03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:23.100]  and then have them go through pain so that they grow up and chose to be with God because
[03:28:23.100 --> 03:28:28.980]  we have free will because God respects us so much that he would let this horrible wicked
[03:28:28.980 --> 03:28:31.740]  devil system attack his very children.
[03:28:31.740 --> 03:28:34.780]  Like the Bible says, God loves a sparrow of the field.
[03:28:34.780 --> 03:28:36.300]  Think how much God thinks about you.
[03:28:36.300 --> 03:28:40.940]  I apologize to Raymond and Bob and I'm not going to crap on Papry, who I really want
[03:28:40.940 --> 03:28:41.940]  to hear from.
[03:28:41.940 --> 03:28:42.940]  He's taken over.
[03:28:42.940 --> 03:28:43.940]  He wants to take those calls he can.
[03:28:43.940 --> 03:28:44.940]  But that's it.
[03:28:44.940 --> 03:28:47.380]  War Room coming up with Owen at three o'clock central.

[03:33:18.260 --> 03:33:21.820]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:21.820 --> 03:33:28.700]  I am Tom Papert, God Emperor Trump on Facebook, KCTV5 here in Wichita, Kansas, filling in
[03:33:28.700 --> 03:33:29.700]  for Alex.
[03:33:29.700 --> 03:33:33.580]  Thank you so much to Alex and everyone at InfoWars for giving me this opportunity and
[03:33:33.580 --> 03:33:38.140]  I apologize to those callers we didn't get to, but I know Alex is much more fun to talk
[03:33:38.140 --> 03:33:39.140]  to than I am.
[03:33:39.140 --> 03:33:43.620]  So I've got to kind of follow up on what Alex has been talking about today.
[03:33:43.620 --> 03:33:50.540]  This ridiculous, pedophilic drag queen hour, these vampires who exist in our midst, they're
[03:33:50.540 --> 03:33:55.460]  obviously also in government, they're also in politics, some of them are running for
[03:33:55.460 --> 03:33:57.540]  president or are about to.
[03:33:57.540 --> 03:34:02.860]  The big story that I want to cover, our first one for the day, Joe Biden, the scandal that
[03:34:02.860 --> 03:34:04.540]  just will not quit.
[03:34:04.540 --> 03:34:06.100]  Now he's attempting to make light of it.
[03:34:06.100 --> 03:34:10.820]  You've got him sniffing these women's hair, you've got him caressing children's face.
[03:34:10.820 --> 03:34:15.300]  There's viral videos going back decades of this now and it's something that those of
[03:34:15.300 --> 03:34:18.060]  us on the right, we've known about it for a long time.
[03:34:18.060 --> 03:34:22.980]  We are all old hands at this because Joe Biden has always been creepy, but all of a sudden
[03:34:22.980 --> 03:34:26.500]  now it's in the media and Joe Biden thinks he's going to make light of it.
[03:34:26.500 --> 03:34:28.380]  That seems to be the new strategy.
[03:34:28.380 --> 03:34:32.340]  We've got the article up at bigleaguepolitics.com, I also write there.
[03:34:32.340 --> 03:34:39.500]  He gave me permission to touch him, Biden hugs kids during bizarre event.
[03:34:39.500 --> 03:34:43.940]  Can you just imagine if President Trump, when he said, grab him by the, you know what, if
[03:34:43.940 --> 03:34:48.740]  he had said, oh, well, it's just funny, let's laugh about it, haha, it's no big deal.
[03:34:48.740 --> 03:34:50.980]  That would have been a train wreck.
[03:34:50.980 --> 03:34:54.740]  But now Joe Biden, who is getting ready to run for president any day now, gets to say
[03:34:54.740 --> 03:34:58.660]  things like, he gave me permission to touch him, all right?
[03:34:58.660 --> 03:35:02.180]  Everyone knows I like kids better than people.
[03:35:02.180 --> 03:35:05.820]  And if you just watch this, it's everybody he comes in contact with.
[03:35:05.820 --> 03:35:07.660]  The guy is too physical.
[03:35:07.660 --> 03:35:11.180]  He has no personal space boundaries whatsoever.
[03:35:11.180 --> 03:35:17.140]  And one thing that has really bothered me as this has broken the last few days is nobody
[03:35:17.140 --> 03:35:18.980]  is talking about the children.
[03:35:18.980 --> 03:35:23.640]  You have all of these adult women, some of them in their 20s, 30s, 40s, who are coming
[03:35:23.640 --> 03:35:28.900]  forward to say, Joe Biden made me feel uncomfortable when he did X, Y, Z.
[03:35:28.900 --> 03:35:36.140]  But then you go online and there's dozens and dozens of pictures of children being caressed
[03:35:36.140 --> 03:35:37.140]  by Joe Biden.
[03:35:37.140 --> 03:35:42.260]  I mean, you can say it's not sexual contact, but would you let this stranger go up and
[03:35:42.260 --> 03:35:43.260]  touch your child?
[03:35:43.260 --> 03:35:48.060]  Would you sit in a room with your child and Joe Biden and not be in panic mode the whole
[03:35:48.060 --> 03:35:53.380]  time about what type of physical contact is going to happen in that space?
[03:35:53.380 --> 03:35:58.780]  I don't think anybody on left, right, or center, except maybe the lunatics who take their kids
[03:35:58.780 --> 03:36:00.860]  to the drag queen story hour.
[03:36:00.860 --> 03:36:03.100]  Maybe they would have no problem with Alex Jones being there.
[03:36:03.100 --> 03:36:05.300]  But it is, frankly, shocking.
[03:36:05.300 --> 03:36:06.300]  And he kept going.
[03:36:06.300 --> 03:36:11.260]  He said, when talking about the event organizer, I just wanted to let you know that I had permission
[03:36:11.260 --> 03:36:12.340]  to hug Lonnie.
[03:36:12.340 --> 03:36:13.860]  I had permission.
[03:36:13.860 --> 03:36:15.020]  He's joking about it.
[03:36:15.020 --> 03:36:17.860]  He shoves it right into our faces.
[03:36:17.860 --> 03:36:21.660]  He knows what he's doing is bizarre and inappropriate.
[03:36:21.660 --> 03:36:22.660]  But there's no problem.
[03:36:22.660 --> 03:36:28.220]  The audience was actually laughing at the jokes, according to reports, despite Biden's ongoing
[03:36:28.220 --> 03:36:33.980]  battle with now, I think it's up to seven women who say that he made them uncomfortable
[03:36:33.980 --> 03:36:36.140]  by touching them inappropriately.
[03:36:36.140 --> 03:36:38.740]  Five women have come out publicly.
[03:36:38.740 --> 03:36:43.140]  During his speech, he complained about what he sees as a lack of appreciation for the
[03:36:43.140 --> 03:36:46.420]  American worker trying to style himself as President Trump.
[03:36:46.420 --> 03:36:52.900]  I really think that because in these imaginary leftist universe, they think that Trump sexually
[03:36:52.900 --> 03:36:56.980]  assaults women with no recourse, which is, of course, completely untrue.
[03:36:56.980 --> 03:37:01.180]  He was bragging to other men that women would willingly let him do something that we won't
[03:37:01.180 --> 03:37:02.820]  say on air.
[03:37:02.820 --> 03:37:07.500]  And so now, I think he's really trying to cast himself as the Trump archetype, that
[03:37:07.500 --> 03:37:10.620]  it's okay, we're just gonna laugh about it and move on.
[03:37:10.620 --> 03:37:14.500]  He said, we've gotten so damn sophisticated, so damn elitist.
[03:37:14.500 --> 03:37:18.700]  I hate the way things have changed in the last 15 to 20 years, echoing a lot of what
[03:37:18.700 --> 03:37:19.940]  President Trump talks about.
[03:37:19.940 --> 03:37:22.180]  But he's not talking about political correctness.
[03:37:22.180 --> 03:37:26.860]  And that's part of the beauty here, I think, is this is a little bit like Saul Alinsky's
[03:37:26.860 --> 03:37:29.980]  rules for radicals, the situation with Joe Biden.
[03:37:29.980 --> 03:37:35.940]  You have the left, which says that unverified reports from 25, 30 years ago can be used
[03:37:35.940 --> 03:37:40.860]  to keep somebody off the Supreme Court, that Trump talking in a bus when he's going on
[03:37:40.860 --> 03:37:46.460]  what essentially is a shock jock turn TV show, that this is reasons why we can't have right
[03:37:46.460 --> 03:37:47.820]  wingers in office.
[03:37:47.820 --> 03:37:51.780]  And then the same exact thing happens to Joe Biden, and suddenly it's, I hate the way things
[03:37:51.780 --> 03:37:52.780]  have changed.
[03:37:52.780 --> 03:37:54.860]  I hate the way the world is going.
[03:37:54.860 --> 03:38:00.260]  We need to get rid of this political correctness because now it affects him.
[03:38:00.260 --> 03:38:04.580]  So speaking of vampires, that is exactly what this is to me.
[03:38:04.580 --> 03:38:09.140]  You have somebody who goes up and touches people, and in his weird little apology video,
[03:38:09.140 --> 03:38:12.260]  he says it's, well, that's how I show people I listen.
[03:38:12.260 --> 03:38:13.860]  That's how I show people I care.
[03:38:13.860 --> 03:38:19.860]  I go and I grab them by the waist as he did Hillary Clinton, and I don't let go.
[03:38:19.860 --> 03:38:25.740]  It's weird, and it reminds me of, to bring another sicko into this, Ed Buck, the guy
[03:38:25.740 --> 03:38:33.580]  who has been tangentially related to the deaths of numerous black men who died in his apartment,
[03:38:33.580 --> 03:38:35.220]  usually of a drug overdose.
[03:38:35.220 --> 03:38:39.100]  And some men have come forward saying that Ed Buck feeds off their energy.
[03:38:39.100 --> 03:38:43.380]  He feeds off the fantastic energy of young black gay men.
[03:38:43.380 --> 03:38:45.820]  He pays them so he can take them to his apartment.
[03:38:45.820 --> 03:38:48.020]  This is all alleged, by the way, none of this is proven.
[03:38:48.020 --> 03:38:52.500]  This is what the so-called apparent victims, alleged victims say happens.
[03:38:52.500 --> 03:38:57.940]  He pays them to come to his apartment so he can inject them with drugs and feed off their
[03:38:57.940 --> 03:38:59.500]  energy.
[03:38:59.500 --> 03:39:02.740]  And this is something that, as Alex pointed out, and several of the callers have pointed
[03:39:02.740 --> 03:39:05.900]  out, this is something that's been happening since the dawn of time.
[03:39:05.900 --> 03:39:11.020]  You have these evil people who get high, causing harm to the innocent.
[03:39:11.020 --> 03:39:12.980]  And if they can do it to children, all the better.
[03:39:12.980 --> 03:39:16.300]  If they can do it to young black men, all the better.
[03:39:16.300 --> 03:39:18.380]  That's what they get off from.
[03:39:18.380 --> 03:39:24.500]  And another really kind of breaking story that we have up from yesterday at Big League Politics.
[03:39:24.500 --> 03:39:29.700]  This seems to be a common denominator with Democrats, something that they all just keep
[03:39:29.700 --> 03:39:30.700]  stepping in.
[03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:31.900]  They all just keep getting caught in.
[03:39:31.900 --> 03:39:39.900]  Kirsten Gillibrand, it turns out her father worked for the infamous NXIVM cult, the sex
[03:39:39.900 --> 03:39:45.980]  cult, which shut down after, with a lot of help, I should note, from Info War's own
[03:39:45.980 --> 03:39:53.420]  Roger Stone, who went in basically undercover to help get the disgusting sex cult shut down.
[03:39:53.420 --> 03:39:57.060]  And of course, the fake news media likes to spin it as Roger Stone was involved in the
[03:39:57.060 --> 03:39:58.060]  sex cult.
[03:39:58.060 --> 03:39:59.260]  No, he helped destroy it.
[03:39:59.260 --> 03:40:00.460]  He demolished the thing.
[03:40:00.460 --> 03:40:02.420]  He said it was disgusting, terrible too much.
[03:40:02.420 --> 03:40:06.740]  He's talked about it on Info Wars, which of course he is now no longer allowed to do.
[03:40:06.740 --> 03:40:08.340]  They've taken his first amendment away from him.
[03:40:08.340 --> 03:40:13.580]  But Kirsten Gillibrand, who if she gets her way will be the first female president of
[03:40:13.580 --> 03:40:17.780]  the United States, the female Democrat senator.
[03:40:17.780 --> 03:40:24.420]  Her lobbyist father, Doug Rutnick, was employed by the sex cult, according to court documents.
[03:40:24.420 --> 03:40:30.140]  And eyewitness actually described how Gillibrand sat at the NXIVM table at a Hillary Clinton
[03:40:30.140 --> 03:40:32.780]  fundraiser.
[03:40:32.780 --> 03:40:37.540]  And one must ask, they're attending Hillary Clinton fundraisers?
[03:40:37.540 --> 03:40:40.460]  Just how interwoven and interconnected is all this?
[03:40:40.460 --> 03:40:44.980]  And by the way, this story is something that started out kind of out of left field before
[03:40:44.980 --> 03:40:45.980]  you know it.
[03:40:45.980 --> 03:40:46.980]  Fox News is reporting it.
[03:40:46.980 --> 03:40:47.980]  Before you know it, it's everywhere.
[03:40:47.980 --> 03:40:48.980]  It's on the Daily Collar.
[03:40:48.980 --> 03:40:49.980]  It's on Daily Wire.
[03:40:49.980 --> 03:40:55.380]  It's on Breitbart because this is insanity that these people who are affiliated with
[03:40:55.380 --> 03:41:03.740]  a sex cult, these metaphorical vampires are trying to run the country.
[03:41:03.740 --> 03:41:07.660]  It's absolutely mind boggling to those of us with our eyes open, maybe to the average
[03:41:07.660 --> 03:41:08.660]  member of the public.
[03:41:08.660 --> 03:41:13.340]  But that's why the Infowars audience is so important.
[03:41:13.340 --> 03:41:17.580]  And on that note, I do have to remind everybody, because Alex Jones says he forgets the plug
[03:41:17.580 --> 03:41:18.580]  all the time.
[03:41:18.580 --> 03:41:19.580]  And it's true he does.
[03:41:19.580 --> 03:41:21.620]  He gets so wrapped up in the news that the plugs just don't come out.
[03:41:21.620 --> 03:41:27.340]  It is so important to support this Infowars, support websites that are showing that women
[03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:33.540]  running for president are apparently sickos, or at least connected to sickos.
[03:41:33.540 --> 03:41:36.420]  So InfowarsStore.com, some of the best deals I've ever seen.
[03:41:36.420 --> 03:41:39.860]  I've been following Alex very closely for about four years now.
[03:41:39.860 --> 03:41:43.580]  I've known about him for a decade prior to that, ever since I was a young kid.
[03:41:43.580 --> 03:41:48.660]  But right now, these are some of the best deals you will ever see, 60% off major products,
[03:41:48.660 --> 03:41:54.420]  including the flagship Brainforce, free shipping all over the site, site-wide.
[03:41:54.420 --> 03:41:59.780]  It is honestly one of the best opportunities to stock up that I have seen in some time.
[03:41:59.780 --> 03:42:05.700]  And it's all for the Save the First Amendment Stop Big Tech Censorship special.
[03:42:05.700 --> 03:42:09.980]  And of course, as usual, when I guest host the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show here,
[03:42:09.980 --> 03:42:12.580]  I have my two of my favorite products at least.
[03:42:12.580 --> 03:42:14.140]  See, I need to stock up as well.
[03:42:14.140 --> 03:42:18.900]  This is a good opportunity for me to break out the debit card and go to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:42:18.900 --> 03:42:21.500]  Because as you can see, I've got my alpha male rights here.
[03:42:21.500 --> 03:42:29.460]  I've got my super, I'm sorry, my X2, Deep Earth iodine crystals, both absolutely fantastic
[03:42:29.460 --> 03:42:30.460]  products.
[03:42:30.460 --> 03:42:32.140]  I'm also a big fan of super male vitality.
[03:42:32.140 --> 03:42:35.980]  If it's still available, get it while you can, there is some rumors that you're going
[03:42:35.980 --> 03:42:37.180]  to be able to source it again.
[03:42:37.180 --> 03:42:42.220]  But it's all so important to support Alex Jones, support the Infowar, do not let the
[03:42:42.220 --> 03:42:47.980]  globalist win, and you do that by again, InfowarsStore.com.
[03:42:47.980 --> 03:42:48.980]  We'll be back.
[03:42:48.980 --> 03:42:51.420]  I'm Tom Pepper, Facebook's got him for Trump.
[03:42:51.420 --> 03:42:53.420]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[03:42:53.420 --> 03:42:58.460]  And now through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[03:42:58.460 --> 03:43:01.380]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[03:43:01.380 --> 03:43:04.100]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.
[03:43:04.100 --> 03:43:09.780]  Free shipping store-wide, that's free shipping store-wide, free shipping store-wide, 50% off

[03:43:32.860 --> 03:43:35.100]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the Infowar.
[03:43:35.100 --> 03:43:40.300]  I want to encourage you today to get great products in the 360 win, InfowarsStore.com.
[03:43:40.300 --> 03:43:45.300]  Voting with our feet, voting with our dollars, voting with our mouths, voting with our speech,
[03:43:45.300 --> 03:43:50.380]  voting with our action, free shipping store-wide, that's free shipping store-wide, free shipping
[03:43:50.380 --> 03:43:54.300]  store-wide, InfowarsStore.com.
[03:43:54.300 --> 03:43:55.740]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[03:43:55.740 --> 03:43:57.740]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[03:43:57.740 --> 03:43:58.740]  It is.
[03:43:58.740 --> 03:44:01.260]  I took it with fish oil.
[03:44:01.260 --> 03:44:03.220]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:03.220 --> 03:44:06.460]  The fish oil is better than it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:06.460 --> 03:44:11.980]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:11.980 --> 03:44:15.180]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[03:44:15.180 --> 03:44:18.860]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:44:18.860 --> 03:44:22.220]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn
[03:44:22.220 --> 03:44:23.220]  burps.
[03:44:23.220 --> 03:44:25.580]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:25.580 --> 03:44:26.580]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:26.580 --> 03:44:27.580]  It's so good.
[03:44:27.580 --> 03:44:28.580]  In my view.
[03:44:28.580 --> 03:44:30.780]  I'm not a huge medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:44:30.780 --> 03:44:33.660]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:33.660 --> 03:44:37.140]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:37.140 --> 03:44:44.620]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:44.620 --> 03:44:48.060]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[03:44:48.060 --> 03:44:50.420]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.420 --> 03:44:54.540]  I just can't do it.
[03:44:54.540 --> 03:44:56.580]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:44:56.580 --> 03:44:57.580]  Go ahead.
[03:44:57.580 --> 03:44:59.580]  Well, I just have to say something, man.
[03:44:59.580 --> 03:45:03.300]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:45:03.300 --> 03:45:04.300]  It just gets old, man.
[03:45:04.300 --> 03:45:06.460]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:45:06.460 --> 03:45:07.460]  Okay.
[03:45:07.460 --> 03:45:09.500]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:45:09.500 --> 03:45:14.060]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:45:14.060 --> 03:45:16.100]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:45:16.100 --> 03:45:19.380]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:45:19.380 --> 03:45:21.940]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[03:45:21.940 --> 03:45:22.940]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:45:22.940 --> 03:45:23.940]  Yeah, you know what?
[03:45:23.940 --> 03:45:24.940]  I'll take it.
[03:45:24.940 --> 03:45:25.940]  Put him on pause again.
[03:45:25.940 --> 03:45:26.940]  Hey, Frank.
[03:45:26.940 --> 03:45:30.460]  I understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear.
[03:45:30.460 --> 03:45:31.460]  We're under attack.
[03:45:31.460 --> 03:45:32.460]  We need your help.
[03:45:32.460 --> 03:45:36.740]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:45:36.740 --> 03:45:39.700]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:45:39.700 --> 03:45:40.700]  Do you understand?
[03:45:40.700 --> 03:45:41.980]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:41.980 --> 03:45:44.260]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:44.260 --> 03:45:49.260]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info.
[03:45:49.260 --> 03:45:50.540]  Do you understand?
[03:45:50.540 --> 03:45:52.220]  I need your help, Frank.
[03:45:52.220 --> 03:45:54.740]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[03:45:54.740 --> 03:45:59.660]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and
[03:45:59.660 --> 03:46:02.700]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[03:46:02.700 --> 03:46:05.220]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:46:05.220 --> 03:46:08.740]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:46:08.740 --> 03:46:10.380]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:46:10.380 --> 03:46:15.260]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm
[03:46:15.260 --> 03:46:16.740]  simply trying to bring it back.
[03:46:16.740 --> 03:46:21.020]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[03:46:21.020 --> 03:46:25.020]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[03:46:25.020 --> 03:46:28.860]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[03:46:28.860 --> 03:46:33.380]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[03:46:33.380 --> 03:46:37.820]  at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for
[03:46:37.820 --> 03:46:42.420]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:46:42.420 --> 03:46:46.340]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[03:46:46.340 --> 03:46:50.260]  done because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[03:46:50.260 --> 03:46:57.940]  You are the Infowar, and I salute you.
[03:46:57.940 --> 03:47:17.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.940 --> 03:47:21.460]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.460 --> 03:47:28.340]  I am Tom Pappert, Facebook's God Emperor, Trump, KCTV5 here in Wichita, Kansas.
[03:47:28.340 --> 03:47:32.700]  You know, it has been a little bit of a dark edition of the Alex Jones Show here.
[03:47:32.700 --> 03:47:36.180]  I've watched most of the show today here, making sure I would stay consistent with
[03:47:36.180 --> 03:47:37.180]  Alex.
[03:47:37.180 --> 03:47:41.380]  But one thing I like to do on my program on Facebook, God Emperor, Trump Live, is leave
[03:47:41.380 --> 03:47:45.420]  everybody with a little bit of uplifting news, and it is very important.
[03:47:45.420 --> 03:47:47.900]  Everybody needs to go to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:47:47.900 --> 03:47:52.420]  These people out here fighting the Infowar need support because we need to continue growing
[03:47:52.420 --> 03:47:55.060]  and expanding every last one of us.
[03:47:55.060 --> 03:48:00.740]  But I do want to, again, give you a little uplifting news and a reminder that we are
[03:48:00.740 --> 03:48:04.300]  the silent majority in this country, even under Trump.
[03:48:04.300 --> 03:48:08.820]  Many of us are still silent because we don't want to be attacked in public, fired, ostracized,
[03:48:08.820 --> 03:48:10.100]  any number of terrible things.
[03:48:10.100 --> 03:48:17.700]  We don't want the vampiric armies to assemble against us, but this is just an example, a
[03:48:17.700 --> 03:48:19.940]  look into our silent majority.
[03:48:19.940 --> 03:48:25.820]  Tucker Carlson on Fox News, one of the few Fox News hosts who really gets it, I think,
[03:48:25.820 --> 03:48:27.860]  of course, he's been on Infowars before.
[03:48:27.860 --> 03:48:30.940]  He seems to be a friend of Alex Jones and the Infowars team.
[03:48:30.940 --> 03:48:38.540]  Tucker Carlson is currently getting more viewers than all of CNN's primetime content combined.
[03:48:38.540 --> 03:48:45.260]  Put it all together and there are about 400,000 people less than Tucker Carlson.
[03:48:45.260 --> 03:48:50.940]  That is the power of Fox News when they decide to put a patriot on the air.
[03:48:50.940 --> 03:48:54.860]  It's frankly, if they were financially motivated, they would probably have all patriots on the
[03:48:54.860 --> 03:48:55.860]  air.
[03:48:55.860 --> 03:48:58.540]  But we all know that they probably have a hidden agenda.
[03:48:58.540 --> 03:49:05.540]  So this is, to me, just beautiful evidence that the people are waking up.
[03:49:05.540 --> 03:49:08.820]  I've run the numbers before, of course, it's all rough estimates.
[03:49:08.820 --> 03:49:13.660]  And now, since Alex Jones has been unpersoned so severely, you never know.
[03:49:13.660 --> 03:49:18.620]  It's hard to get the actual nuts and bolts now because everything Infowars is very intelligent.
[03:49:18.620 --> 03:49:20.540]  It's all proprietary information now.
[03:49:20.540 --> 03:49:25.020]  But Alex Jones probably reaches even more than Tucker Carlson.
[03:49:25.020 --> 03:49:28.940]  And it's probably growing every single day as more TV and radio affiliates get on the
[03:49:28.940 --> 03:49:34.620]  air as people figure out how to skirt the big tech systems and show Alex Jones content
[03:49:34.620 --> 03:49:38.420]  on the big tech platforms without their permission.
[03:49:38.420 --> 03:49:42.660]  It's a good reminder that you're not alone out there, regardless of how isolated the
[03:49:42.660 --> 03:49:44.260]  left tries to make you feel.
[03:49:44.260 --> 03:49:47.380]  There are lots of people just like you.
[03:49:47.380 --> 03:49:51.220]  So the next story I want to talk about, we've talked again, it's been kind of a dark episode
[03:49:51.220 --> 03:49:56.180]  talking about these men wearing dresses doing the drag queen story hour where they want
[03:49:56.180 --> 03:49:59.740]  to sit on your toddler on their lap.
[03:49:59.740 --> 03:50:06.780]  These are many times, at least twice that we know of, convicted child rapists who molest
[03:50:06.780 --> 03:50:11.900]  and do violent sexual violence against six year olds.
[03:50:11.900 --> 03:50:12.900]  These are the people who come out.
[03:50:12.900 --> 03:50:16.820]  Now, the Pope has weighed in on this pedophile scandal.
[03:50:16.820 --> 03:50:17.820]  Oh, no, he hasn't.
[03:50:17.820 --> 03:50:18.820]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:50:18.820 --> 03:50:19.820]  I'm sorry.
[03:50:19.820 --> 03:50:25.900]  Pedophile Pope alleged set sights on the scourge of fake news.
[03:50:25.900 --> 03:50:26.900]  That's right.
[03:50:26.900 --> 03:50:33.220]  A scourge barely does a day go by without another sexual grooming, pedophilia, gay sex scandal
[03:50:33.220 --> 03:50:34.220]  comes out.
[03:50:34.220 --> 03:50:35.220]  Well, don't worry.
[03:50:35.220 --> 03:50:42.140]  The Pope has his priorities straight because you see, fake news is one of the worst things
[03:50:42.140 --> 03:50:43.140]  that can possibly happen.
[03:50:43.140 --> 03:50:47.500]  This is one of those stories where it's if you don't laugh, you cry.
[03:50:47.500 --> 03:50:53.500]  He is only once, to my knowledge, publicly said anything about the pedophile and sexual
[03:50:53.500 --> 03:50:59.460]  assault scandals that have rocked the Vatican for decades now and continue through the 2010s.
[03:50:59.460 --> 03:51:04.660]  But he says there are huge economic interests operating in the digital world, capable of
[03:51:04.660 --> 03:51:10.640]  exercising forms of control that are as subtle as they are invasive, creating mechanisms
[03:51:10.640 --> 03:51:15.340]  for the manipulation of conscience and the democratic process.
[03:51:15.340 --> 03:51:20.460]  You read that, that word salad, and is he talking about when Jack Dorsey on Twitter
[03:51:20.460 --> 03:51:24.660]  shadow bans us so the average Twitter user isn't even able to see my tweets?
[03:51:24.660 --> 03:51:27.060]  No Twitter user is able to see Alex Jones tweets.
[03:51:27.060 --> 03:51:28.820]  He's been again, unperson.
[03:51:28.820 --> 03:51:34.420]  Is he talking about on Facebook where they deboost conservative content so it's seen
[03:51:34.420 --> 03:51:35.700]  by less people?
[03:51:35.700 --> 03:51:39.460]  Where they basically admit that they will shadow ban you if you are to the right of
[03:51:39.460 --> 03:51:40.460]  Joseph Stalin?
[03:51:40.460 --> 03:51:41.460]  Is that what he's talking about?
[03:51:41.460 --> 03:51:46.940]  Is he talking about on Google and YouTube where they say we want to ban Ben Shapiro?
[03:51:46.940 --> 03:51:50.420]  We're just waiting for him to break the rules so we can ban Ben Shapiro like we did Alex
[03:51:50.420 --> 03:51:51.420]  Jones.
[03:51:51.420 --> 03:51:53.260]  And as soon as that happens, oh boy, we're gonna ban him.
[03:51:53.260 --> 03:51:54.260]  We're gonna ban him.
[03:51:54.260 --> 03:51:55.260]  Is that what he's talking about?
[03:51:55.260 --> 03:51:57.380]  No, no, no, of course not.
[03:51:57.380 --> 03:52:00.420]  He's talking about what he calls fake news.
[03:52:00.420 --> 03:52:05.800]  He says these closed circuits facilitate the spread of fake news and false information
[03:52:05.800 --> 03:52:09.540]  fomenting prejudice and hate.
[03:52:09.540 --> 03:52:15.060]  What a joke the Catholic Church has become under this man and even before him, controversy
[03:52:15.060 --> 03:52:19.660]  after controversy after controversy and he wants to fight fake news.
[03:52:19.660 --> 03:52:21.940]  You've got a Muslim invasion of Europe.
[03:52:21.940 --> 03:52:26.380]  You've got a world that will never be the same under his watch and what does he do?
[03:52:26.380 --> 03:52:32.100]  He kisses the feet of these refugees of peace and he fights fake news.
[03:52:32.100 --> 03:52:33.940]  It is absolutely comical.
[03:52:33.940 --> 03:52:37.820]  It is a bit like a clown world to be living in.
[03:52:37.820 --> 03:52:40.460]  So this last story I want to spend some time on.
[03:52:40.460 --> 03:52:44.420]  This is, I believe, the beta test for what happened to Alex Jones.
[03:52:44.420 --> 03:52:49.580]  I think we discovered it at bigleaguepolitics.com and this was the beta test.
[03:52:49.580 --> 03:52:56.300]  I can't find anybody else who had this happen, but a Chinese MMA star was unpersoned after
[03:52:56.300 --> 03:52:58.380]  basically proving that Tai Chi sucks.
[03:52:58.380 --> 03:53:01.780]  We've got the article up on bigleaguepolitics.com.
[03:53:01.780 --> 03:53:06.820]  This man whose name I'm going to terribly butcher and I apologize to any Chinese viewers
[03:53:06.820 --> 03:53:07.820]  in the audience.
[03:53:07.820 --> 03:53:14.260]  Xiaodong, I'm going to guess, he saw on the Chinese state-run media, he saw a man doing
[03:53:14.260 --> 03:53:18.140]  Tai Chi and he was using Tai Chi to beat all kinds of people.
[03:53:18.140 --> 03:53:22.180]  Well, this guy did some research and found out that it was actually all fake.
[03:53:22.180 --> 03:53:27.700]  It's Chuck Norris' tear production, which actually Chuck Norris was not fake, but it's
[03:53:27.700 --> 03:53:34.900]  a Hollywood production done in China to make Tai Chi, which is, of course, a Chinese art,
[03:53:34.900 --> 03:53:36.740]  look really, really impressive.
[03:53:36.740 --> 03:53:40.540]  And so he finds this out and he challenges this guy named Wei Li.
[03:53:40.540 --> 03:53:46.300]  He challenges him to a fight, flies halfway across the massive country of China to fight
[03:53:46.300 --> 03:53:47.300]  him.
[03:53:47.300 --> 03:53:51.260]  And the guy doing Tai Chi goes down in about nine seconds.
[03:53:51.260 --> 03:53:55.420]  If that, the ref had to get between them before serious harm could be done.
[03:53:55.420 --> 03:53:58.660]  And so this guy's thinking, ha, see, China's going to move forward.
[03:53:58.660 --> 03:54:02.940]  We're going to accept mixed martial art as a legitimate form of martial arts.
[03:54:02.940 --> 03:54:04.660]  This is going to be fantastic.
[03:54:04.660 --> 03:54:05.980]  He's at the lead.
[03:54:05.980 --> 03:54:09.100]  Everything's great until he turned on the TV.
[03:54:09.100 --> 03:54:14.860]  And he saw on the TV, the Chinese state-run media repeating over and over and over again
[03:54:14.860 --> 03:54:20.500]  that he disgraced China, that he brought a foreign force to invade China, and he hates
[03:54:20.500 --> 03:54:22.820]  Chinese traditions.
[03:54:22.820 --> 03:54:27.560]  And then before you know it, he was purged off the Chinese social media.
[03:54:27.560 --> 03:54:29.020]  He was purged off the internet.
[03:54:29.020 --> 03:54:31.500]  He can no longer upload videos.
[03:54:31.500 --> 03:54:41.100]  He has been totally unpersoned for winning a fight against a guy doing Tai Chi.
[03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:47.820]  And then you think, wow, when did this happen, and you do a little bit of digging, 2015?
[03:54:47.820 --> 03:54:55.820]  Three years before Alex Jones would be unpersoned in the exact same way.
[03:54:55.820 --> 03:54:56.840]  And for what?
[03:54:56.840 --> 03:54:58.700]  This guy won a fight.
[03:54:58.700 --> 03:55:04.380]  This guy proved that not that the West is the best, but that mixed martial arts beats
[03:55:04.380 --> 03:55:06.300]  Tai Chi.
[03:55:06.300 --> 03:55:07.380]  And he was unpersoned.
[03:55:07.380 --> 03:55:09.260]  Now what was Alex Jones unpersoned for?
[03:55:09.260 --> 03:55:11.480]  I still can't get anybody to tell me.
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:16.420]  Some people say it's because he posted the video of the guy who lost his temper and pushed
[03:55:16.420 --> 03:55:17.420]  the kid down.
[03:55:17.420 --> 03:55:18.780]  Some people say it's because of this.
[03:55:18.780 --> 03:55:20.180]  Some people say it's because of that.
[03:55:20.180 --> 03:55:24.260]  And eventually, if you push them hard and long enough, they'll say, oh, Sandy Hook, which
[03:55:24.260 --> 03:55:27.020]  of course Alex Jones has spoken about at great length.
[03:55:27.020 --> 03:55:29.740]  Nobody can figure out what he did wrong.
[03:55:29.740 --> 03:55:31.300]  Nobody can figure out why.
[03:55:31.300 --> 03:55:37.940]  Yet, all together, after the media condemned him, after the media said that he is a conspiracy
[03:55:37.940 --> 03:55:41.700]  terrorist and a vile man and an evil person with the heart of darkness, as Hillary Clinton
[03:55:41.700 --> 03:55:48.580]  said, then Big Tech, in lockstep with the Democrats and their allies in the media, decided he
[03:55:48.580 --> 03:55:50.100]  had to go.
[03:55:50.100 --> 03:55:55.540]  So I think this is absolutely fascinating that Big Tech apparently had their beta test
[03:55:55.540 --> 03:56:00.940]  in China, where we know that Google has essentially sold to China, Facebook desperately wanted
[03:56:00.940 --> 03:56:03.860]  to and Hong Kong kicked them out.
[03:56:03.860 --> 03:56:04.860]  And this is it.
[03:56:04.860 --> 03:56:05.860]  This is the beta test.
[03:56:05.860 --> 03:56:09.660]  This is what they did to see if the public, granted the Chinese public is a little bit
[03:56:09.660 --> 03:56:13.900]  different than the West, if the public would be OK with somebody being totally unpersoned.
[03:56:13.900 --> 03:56:15.700]  It turns out they are.
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:17.260]  And so now it's happened to Alex Jones.
[03:56:17.260 --> 03:56:18.260]  But the fight isn't over.
[03:56:18.260 --> 03:56:19.700]  The West is not China.
[03:56:19.700 --> 03:56:24.940]  And as this man said, he said, yes, I criticize many people online.
[03:56:24.940 --> 03:56:28.420]  But have you ever considered that what I said was right?
[03:56:28.420 --> 03:56:33.580]  That is the perfect analogy to Alex Jones, who keeps getting proven right time and time
[03:56:33.580 --> 03:56:34.580]  again.
[03:56:34.580 --> 03:56:40.700]  This truly is next year's news today, sometimes next decade's news today.
[03:56:40.700 --> 03:56:45.220]  That's why I am so glad that I get invited on these Friday afternoons to guest host
[03:56:45.220 --> 03:56:46.220]  the fourth hour.
[03:56:46.220 --> 03:56:48.060]  Again, I am Tom Papper.
[03:56:48.060 --> 03:56:50.900]  This has been the Alex Jones show.
[03:56:50.900 --> 03:56:53.700]  Coming up next is War Room with Owen Schreuer.
[03:56:53.700 --> 03:56:55.820]  I highly encourage everybody to check that out.
[03:56:55.820 --> 03:56:59.620]  Owen is a great friend and a fantastic host.
[03:56:59.620 --> 03:57:02.420]  If you haven't checked it out, what have you been living under a rock this past couple
[03:57:02.420 --> 03:57:07.500]  of years, and a reminder to go to InfowarsStore.com.
[03:57:07.500 --> 03:57:12.260]  These are some of the best deals I have ever seen Alex Jones offer.
[03:57:12.260 --> 03:57:15.220]  I sit there and I wonder, how does he make money on any of this stuff?
[03:57:15.220 --> 03:57:19.100]  Of course, I've got my own website as well, and I'm thinking the margins must be non-existent.
[03:57:19.100 --> 03:57:20.700]  So take advantage of this opportunity.
[03:57:20.700 --> 03:57:26.620]  And of course, you can watch me weeknights, 8 p.m. central, on Facebook.com slash God
[03:57:26.620 --> 03:57:28.900]  Emperor Trump official.
[03:57:28.900 --> 03:57:33.220]  And one more time, thank you to Alex Jones and the Infowars crew for doing such a phenomenal
[03:57:33.220 --> 03:57:35.140]  job and giving me this opportunity.
[03:57:35.140 --> 03:57:36.540]  I am Tom Pappert.

[03:58:49.740 --> 03:58:54.180]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
