[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:32.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.200 --> 00:39.360]  here's the headline of CBS News Dallas blood vomit diarrhea soaked hazardous
[00:39.360 --> 00:46.720]  materials piled to the ceiling from just one Ebola patient in Dallas the
[00:46.720 --> 00:53.120]  gentleman that died last Wednesday from West Africa and now a second nurse that
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.440]  treated him out of more than 70 has come down with Ebola and now they think
[00:58.440 --> 01:05.480]  her boyfriend may have it as well and of course they sent at least one of his
[01:05.480 --> 01:10.080]  children to school and he used his apartment and the nearby street as a
[01:10.080 --> 01:17.800]  vomitorium on top of that the feds sent his regular cleaning crews into clean
[01:17.800 --> 01:23.800]  it up Ebola at this point maximum from the numbers I've looked at might be a
[01:23.800 --> 01:29.360]  couple hundred people they're claiming it's three right now so there's no need
[01:29.360 --> 01:34.600]  to panic at this point if somebody sneezes and has a nosebleed or if
[01:34.600 --> 01:38.120]  somebody's had the flu and their intestines are inflamed and they have
[01:38.120 --> 01:42.680]  blood in their feces that is quite common millions of Americans have that
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.600]  every year but if this continues and you get thousands with Ebola and then
[01:47.600 --> 01:53.400]  tens of thousands of Ebola the hysteria alone during the flu season
[01:53.400 --> 02:00.920]  because the first stage of Ebola look like the flu will cause an incredible
[02:00.920 --> 02:06.120]  medical tyranny we've had guests point this out I've pointed this out listeners
[02:06.120 --> 02:12.440]  have pointed this out but this morning watching CNN and then going to the gym
[02:12.440 --> 02:18.320]  CNN was saying you need to take the flu shot because if you get sick they will
[02:18.320 --> 02:25.160]  throw you in a quarantine if you have the regular flu for 21 days or longer as
[02:25.160 --> 02:30.160]  if a flu shot protects you from the flu as if they ever guessed the right
[02:30.160 --> 02:36.800]  mutation a year before they admit they've never guessed it doesn't work it
[02:36.800 --> 02:43.240]  causes neurological disorders it's a fraud the science of immunization is
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.320]  real it has some serious risk but it doesn't work with the flu and that's
[02:48.320 --> 02:57.480]  just the medical literature it doesn't work so I walk into the gym and not one
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.440]  but two different people and I thought they were messy with me because they
[03:03.440 --> 03:09.800]  know who I am but just vaguely and say man better get your flu shot I'm going
[03:09.800 --> 03:16.080]  to get it or if I get sick they'll throw me in quarantine so they won't put in
[03:16.080 --> 03:19.880]  quarantine real people that had Ebola they stuck him in the emergency room
[03:19.880 --> 03:28.600]  they stuck him in a group area for days that's in the news today didn't tell him
[03:28.600 --> 03:33.000]  when they knew he had Ebola for days hey you better wear a high-level mask not
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.840]  just a paper mask the default state and federal health department regulations
[03:38.840 --> 03:42.600]  stated that you were to isolate these people that you want to bring them into
[03:42.600 --> 03:48.840]  the country that you were to halt West African flights this is the default this
[03:48.840 --> 03:57.880]  thing kills between 50 and 90 percent on average 70 percent but it varies 70
[03:57.880 --> 04:01.960]  percent of people that end up getting this will die on average this is a big
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.480]  deal and they get on the news and they say you got a vomit right in an open
[04:06.480 --> 04:13.560]  wound or other gross things to get this and that's not true we know this Ebola
[04:13.560 --> 04:18.480]  is different we know it's mutated 300 plus times we know it's spreading the
[04:18.480 --> 04:29.840]  biggest cases before we're 26 people infected a few years ago now it has
[04:29.840 --> 04:34.000]  infected hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands killed 4,000 plus
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.360]  people we know that's probably a whitewash number is estimated to hit 1.4
[04:38.360 --> 04:41.720]  to 5 million people putting on what estimate you see from the UN and others
[04:41.720 --> 04:49.640]  and the border is open and flights are coming in and now they're talking about
[04:49.640 --> 04:53.960]  maybe screening people you don't screen them you shut the flights down anybody
[04:53.960 --> 04:57.760]  originating out of West Africa you let them know we're not letting in or they'll

[08:38.080 --> 08:51.400]  take me to the gallows the sands of time for our republic and the world a running
[08:51.400 --> 08:59.920]  load because the new world order the technocracy has global chaos on its
[08:59.920 --> 09:15.400]  mind they expect to build on those assets their planetary scientific
[09:15.400 --> 09:21.480]  dictatorship I am your host Alex Jones we're broadcasting worldwide on this
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.400]  October 15th Wednesday transmission James Wesley Rawls former Army
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.200]  intelligence officer best-selling fiction and nonfiction writer and one of the
[09:31.200 --> 09:37.520]  top five survivalist in the world will be joining us coming up in the second
[09:37.520 --> 09:44.960]  hour today to discuss Ebola economic collapse and more so stay with us for
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.040]  that information we'll also open the phones up in this hour and in the hour
[09:50.040 --> 09:59.240]  where Rawls is not on with us as well a second nurse at Dallas Presbyterian has
[09:59.240 --> 10:05.480]  been confirmed to have Ebola a first nurse was confirmed to have Ebola on
[10:05.480 --> 10:12.080]  Sunday subsequent test on Monday confirmed it now the first nurses
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.600]  boyfriend is showing symptoms of Ebola and they were testing him yesterday and
[10:17.600 --> 10:23.920]  have not released it as of we go live right now so that doesn't look too good
[10:23.920 --> 10:32.320]  does it confirmed Ebola is spreading now again I know how to read CDC protocols
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.480]  World Health Organization protocols health department protocols on a level
[10:36.480 --> 10:43.920]  4 contagion and believe me Ebola is the top of the line of bad nastiness some
[10:43.920 --> 10:52.240]  areas 90% die on average at 70% and they brought back dozens and dozens and
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.000]  last number I saw was close to 30 health care workers into the U.S. to be in
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.920]  regular hospital medical facilities but they go don't worry we sealed off one
[11:02.920 --> 11:12.600]  end of a hall with ventilation open not sealed rooms not even level 3 they
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.880]  have them in level 2 containment facilities they've built bio weapons
[11:17.880 --> 11:23.000]  labs in places like Galveston Texas out on a pier and a hurricane four or five
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.080]  years ago hit it and destroyed the entire facility that had Ebola smallpox
[11:28.080 --> 11:36.960]  mousepox in it why would you build since 2001 36 bio weapons labs under the
[11:36.960 --> 11:41.160]  program bio shield and stick them in the middle of major cities everywhere on
[11:41.160 --> 11:46.840]  coastlines or on fault lines in California it's like the devil place
[11:46.840 --> 11:50.800]  these things they're all in the worst spots Los Angeles California Kansas City
[11:50.800 --> 11:56.720]  Missouri Galveston Texas just like they only want to build nuclear reactors on
[11:56.720 --> 12:02.360]  the worst fall they built Devils Canyon reactor on four fault lines the only
[12:02.360 --> 12:06.120]  place in the state where four fault lines come together where they believe
[12:06.120 --> 12:14.620]  the super mega 10.0 will hit two reactors giant jumbo babies will blow sky
[12:14.620 --> 12:24.800]  high why would you pick the worst spot it's demonic it's not like they only
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.440]  pick a few horrible spots they always do the worst thing they always do the
[12:28.440 --> 12:32.080]  most horrible thing even if it was in epic they would do something good
[12:32.080 --> 12:41.840]  sometimes so let me give you the headline now
[12:41.840 --> 12:50.040]  Ebola health worker flew hours before reporting symptoms Bloomberg the second
[12:50.040 --> 12:54.400]  healthcare worker diagnosed with Ebola in Texas flew between Cleveland and
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.320]  Dallas hours before she reported symptoms the state health workers US health
[12:58.320 --> 13:02.280]  officials said today how about if you work in a hospital where somebody's got
[13:02.280 --> 13:07.000]  Ebola you are quarantined to work at home if you choose to have that job if
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.240]  you're gonna I mean plus don't you want to protect your family if I worked in a
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.880]  hospital as a nurse in contact with an Ebola patient when I got home I would
[13:14.880 --> 13:21.320]  spray myself down with bleach in the front yard with a water hose and then I
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.560]  would go through a window and stay in a room and not let my children near me
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.720]  just that's default no-brainer if I worked in the hospital I'd do that but
[13:32.720 --> 13:39.640]  if I worked in the room with him where they reportedly said the blood and the
[13:39.640 --> 13:46.920]  feces was stacked to the ceiling at CBS news it's like a horror movie where they
[13:46.920 --> 13:54.360]  just splatter out they never show this on the news ladies and gentlemen nurses
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.360]  union Ebola patient left an open area of ER for hours they didn't clean the
[13:58.360 --> 14:01.840]  ambulance for days they didn't notify anybody they didn't clean the house for
[14:01.840 --> 14:08.840]  a week they don't care and you can say the hospital wasn't ready why did the
[14:08.840 --> 14:13.000]  CDC once they had an Ebola patient not whisk them away to a federal facility
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.880]  they have 36 of these they have even more level four facilities oh now in
[14:19.880 --> 14:24.080]  Bloomberg yesterday they go we're gonna build special facilities they don't have
[14:24.080 --> 14:27.960]  to build them already there at government bases at federal army bases and
[14:27.960 --> 14:31.040]  things and we have some other sophisticated facilities that's where
[14:31.040 --> 14:38.720]  you're gonna go now well that's where you were supposed to go you don't let the
[14:38.720 --> 14:43.280]  flights come in I know I keep harping on this and when somebody comes in and they
[14:43.280 --> 14:49.680]  test positive for Ebola everyone who is in contact gets put in quarantine because
[14:49.680 --> 14:55.880]  if you don't it's not 50 people or a hundred people in quarantine who by the
[14:55.880 --> 14:59.960]  way they tell these people go home and don't leave and then they catch NBC
[14:59.960 --> 15:09.440]  reporters at restaurants who were in the rooms with people dying with Ebola it's
[15:09.440 --> 15:14.200]  the same NBC medical correspondent I meant to cover yesterday NBC's Nancy
[15:14.200 --> 15:19.000]  Schneiderman breaks Ebola quarantine apologizes this is the woman that said
[15:19.000 --> 15:27.280]  just take your bleeping vaccine oh by the way info wars dot com article by

[15:32.920 --> 15:37.760]  country with experimental Ebola vaccine National Institutes of Health we may
[15:37.760 --> 15:41.720]  need to deploy the vaccine to the entire community oh how are you gonna
[15:41.720 --> 15:45.920]  produce 320 million that's how many Americans there are now another 30
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.400]  million illegals so 300 and I don't know 50 million whatever it is how are you
[15:50.400 --> 15:55.400]  gonna deploy that I mean it would take a year to make that much vaccine they
[15:55.400 --> 16:00.440]  admit oh oh they just so happen to have more than 15 vaccines of the pipeline
[16:00.440 --> 16:05.400]  and three of them become available in December and then even more in January
[16:05.400 --> 16:10.680]  and February oh and then they had the Washington Post and NBC News and market
[16:10.680 --> 16:14.440]  watch of the Wall Street Journal all attack us yesterday in Curtin M.O.'s
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.360]  article taking his quote out of context where he said looks like they'll make a
[16:19.360 --> 16:24.080]  bunch of money off vaccines that are set to come out and they said oh Kurt's
[16:24.080 --> 16:30.160]  crazy info wars is crazy there are no vaccines set to come out and acted like
[16:30.160 --> 16:35.320]  Kurt said it was for sure he said that they may try something like that but of
[16:35.320 --> 16:41.480]  course they are and now they're rolling it out pushing it promoting it just get

[24:18.360 --> 24:25.600]  respiratory illness because Ebola begins like the flu and what the media is
[24:25.600 --> 24:31.040]  implying is that somehow the flu shot will protect you period or you'll be
[24:31.040 --> 24:34.600]  sent to the quarantine center with the other Ebola patients they're really
[24:34.600 --> 24:38.600]  saying you'll be given the death penalty if you don't go out and take the flu
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.120]  shot and even before this Ebola stuff broke out and the government brought it
[24:43.120 --> 24:48.560]  into the country by policy I would hear people in restaurants but also on the
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.400]  news and in person poking each other going you better get the flu shot this
[24:53.400 --> 24:57.800]  year and it doesn't matter if you've got the Canadian government study showing
[24:57.800 --> 25:01.080]  the average flu shot doubles your chances of getting the flu the next year
[25:01.080 --> 25:06.160]  and lowers your immune system by 50% doesn't matter a bunch other studies
[25:06.160 --> 25:09.760]  show that doesn't matter how many medical doctors I have they go on the news and
[25:09.760 --> 25:16.320]  say there's zero side effects and everything's fine and they lie to you
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.680]  show the world horse the world a whore organization I should say the world

[25:28.640 --> 25:35.840]  geographically Reuters the Ebola epidemic is still spreading in Ghana
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.360]  Sierra Leone Liberia and projections show there will be between 5,000 and 10,000

[25:44.680 --> 25:55.960]  yesterday Liberia needs 79,940 more body bags that's from the Washington Post
[25:55.960 --> 25:59.400]  this inventory from the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social
[25:59.400 --> 26:05.400]  Welfare starkly illustrates the huge gap between what Liberia has and what it
[26:05.400 --> 26:11.080]  needs over the next six months well I thought 4,000 people had died folks
[26:11.080 --> 26:15.000]  entire cities and towns are collapsing they're calling Liberia and other
[26:15.000 --> 26:22.320]  countries failed states but don't worry the airports are still running and the
[26:22.320 --> 26:30.080]  people are fleeing to Central and South America and El Norte the United States
[26:30.080 --> 26:36.400]  and if you don't accept some of the Bola into your home you're racist and if you
[26:36.400 --> 26:39.840]  don't accept death panels in Obamacare or the VA having troops on secret

[26:56.240 --> 27:00.440]  save us and so will Obamacare here domestically the UN says the Ebola
[27:00.440 --> 27:04.280]  outbreak must be controlled within 60 days or else the world faces an
[27:04.280 --> 27:09.760]  unprecedented situation for which there is no plan but after it there'll be a
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.600]  global plan to respond to the next thing right there won't be any why'd you leave
[27:14.600 --> 27:17.880]  the flights open why'd you bring the people in why did the UN agree with
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.480]  Obama leave the borders open why did you do all this we'll have Bono come out

[28:25.360 --> 28:29.960]  TV constantly with some rock concert sucking off everyone paying for tickets
[28:29.960 --> 28:38.920]  for his charity to help Africans win the slug of earth I mean it's like Warren
[28:38.920 --> 28:41.960]  Buffett lobbying for higher taxes when he gets the laws written where he's
[28:41.960 --> 28:46.480]  exempt he wants poor people's money he wants higher payroll taxes by poor
[28:46.480 --> 28:49.800]  people who are losing everything they got paid to the government so he gets
[28:49.800 --> 28:55.200]  big bank or bailouts those two ought to be buried together when they die there
[28:55.200 --> 29:00.840]  it is Bono under fire over one charity donations totaling 9.6 million and you

[29:24.680 --> 29:29.080]  charities he promotes give a fraction as well so yeah he gives a fraction and
[29:29.080 --> 29:33.040]  then also the charities he's involved with give a fraction of the number I
[29:33.040 --> 29:37.320]  saw was 2% I guess the number you pulled up is they're saying he gives 2% of
[29:37.320 --> 29:44.880]  his income so he makes 9.6 million pounds and then he gives a hundred and
[29:44.880 --> 29:48.760]  eighteen thousand dollars to it the point is he's a hypocrite we're on the

[34:17.400 --> 34:22.360]  love black people and then he gives 2% but if you have a business and you hire
[34:22.360 --> 34:26.360]  people period and then you keep a bigger percentage the profit because you take
[34:26.360 --> 34:30.920]  the risk you run the business you work at midnight you show up it's greedy and

[35:32.280 --> 35:36.760]  for a very limited time I was thinking yesterday why should we just give 5% off

[35:42.280 --> 35:46.240]  not as strong and it's from a very pure seaweed source but but not the same it's
[35:46.240 --> 35:49.560]  still excellent more palatable for children and others we found as we have
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.560]  both available both original and survival shield X2 why not just give
[35:54.560 --> 36:00.040]  5% off across the board at info wars life calm for a very limited time with
[36:00.040 --> 36:07.000]  promo code now in OW it's time to protect ourselves it's time to get ready
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.400]  it's now to boost our immune systems now in my family for sure info wars life
[36:13.400 --> 36:20.480]  calm and get your vitamin C and get your vitamin D and get your vitamin B12 as
[36:20.480 --> 36:25.880]  well folks and get your sunshine and and get right with God because I've been
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.520]  saying before this Ebola even broke out six months ago the MRSA the super
[36:31.520 --> 36:36.360]  bacteria the plagues the super viruses the drug resistant even the feds are
[36:36.360 --> 36:40.080]  saying they want to start restricting antibiotics to be given to animals when
[36:40.080 --> 36:44.040]  they're not sick I've been in Turkey and poultry production facilities I've seen
[36:44.040 --> 36:50.640]  them I worked off and on for years in agriculture working for a large animal
[36:50.640 --> 36:56.880]  vet so I've seen it all and let me tell you those big factory farms are hellish
[36:56.880 --> 37:00.160]  they are like something out of a science fiction movie you know a million
[37:00.160 --> 37:04.200]  chickens in one giant facility with mites crawling all over them and they
[37:04.200 --> 37:09.120]  can't even stand up they're force feeding them so fast and they give them a
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.680]  bunch of antibiotics and the and the they're basically blind they chop their
[37:12.680 --> 37:16.640]  beaks off at birth so they don't peck themselves and commit suicide I mean it
[37:16.640 --> 37:21.360]  is a hell pit that's why I will not eat processed chicken I will only eat free
[37:21.360 --> 37:26.160]  range from places I know where it came from because it's that's why beef is
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.960]  so good is that it is morally raised out on the field unless when they fatten
[37:30.960 --> 37:35.720]  them up right before slaughter at a feedlot it is morally raised happy
[37:35.720 --> 37:41.480]  animals until they get hit by that gas powered hammer and you know get their
[37:41.480 --> 37:45.080]  brains knocked out they're scared for a few minutes when they're going up there
[37:45.080 --> 37:50.000]  and get slaughtered and then I again I I think it should be more ethical just
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.040]  because what we allow to happen to them ends up happening to us PETA is a death
[37:54.040 --> 37:57.280]  cult eugenicist that are just anti-human and want government to be able to vote
[37:57.280 --> 38:00.440]  for the animals and then out vote the rest of the humans so it's a fraud an
[38:00.440 --> 38:04.640]  absolutely vicious evil organization and I have inside knowledge of it I'll
[38:04.640 --> 38:09.920]  just leave it at that but not myself but family that was able to get into the
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.760]  highest levels of it and then later got out of the cult but and their
[38:14.760 --> 38:18.320]  information is the source of the stuff that's basically wounded PETA mortally
[38:18.320 --> 38:28.680]  but digressing from that even the government now that's run by big pharma
[38:28.680 --> 38:34.400]  is saying we better stop this because it is a petri dish for mutations for
[38:34.400 --> 38:39.520]  bird flu all it's going to take some airborne human communicable bird flu I
[38:39.520 --> 38:43.160]  mean it kills 90 plus percent like Ebola and and they think bird flu will
[38:43.160 --> 38:46.760]  probably go airborne before Ebola and then you don't get a cold folks you die
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.880]  you don't get a cold your kids die there'll be so many dead bodies they'll
[38:51.880 --> 38:55.480]  have to clean them out a year later okay we're talking half the population dead
[38:55.480 --> 38:59.760]  or more by the way the black plague kill between the third and half of Europe
[38:59.760 --> 39:06.400]  no one knows the black plague would kill sometimes a third of China where it
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.520]  came from the bubonic plague and it turns to black with pustules all of
[39:12.520 --> 39:15.720]  your bites what's called the black plague the black death ring around the
[39:15.720 --> 39:21.480]  rosy pocket full of posies ashes to ashes we all fall down and we can come in
[39:21.480 --> 39:26.520]  to the next segment with grave digger Willie Nelson so let's get this straight
[39:26.520 --> 39:30.120]  we have a criminal elite obsessed with releasing bio weapons to reduce our
[39:30.120 --> 39:37.120]  numbers and build some moon raker Zardos Elysium do you think in the movie
[39:37.120 --> 39:42.200]  Elysium they're just going to let big dirt world populations roam around and
[39:42.200 --> 39:45.720]  consume the surface of the earth no they're going to go to their underground
[39:45.720 --> 39:50.640]  Elysium or the field of the immortals I've read documents you can pull them up
[39:50.640 --> 39:55.320]  where the elites in the 70s talked about building Elysium ring space
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.720]  stations with gravity I mean Ian Fleming that was high-level MI 6 and
[40:00.720 --> 40:08.440]  OSS wrote moon raker about it you know the Roger Moore film adaptation of it
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.800]  or a world government group releases a bio weapon to kill everybody while they
[40:12.800 --> 40:18.400]  sit on a space station to come back do you understand this is all the elite
[40:18.400 --> 40:22.400]  talk about this is this is their cult this is what they talk about at cocktail
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.120]  parties this is what they're into this is what they do this is what they discuss
[40:26.120 --> 40:31.280]  and they're told 90% are to be wiped out Dr. Erick Pionka talks about that at UT
[40:31.280 --> 40:34.600]  the FBI visited him
[40:39.760 --> 40:45.080]  oh I just oh nobody's gonna listen to me it doesn't matter everybody just wants
[40:45.080 --> 40:48.120]  to watch their football games I'm convinced most men while their wives and
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.480]  kids are dying and while they're crawling around vomiting with a ball
[40:50.480 --> 40:55.800]  they'll be watching Sports Center I'm serious so hey just you're dead already
[40:55.800 --> 41:02.320]  you want to die you want to roll over you want to give up you want to call
[41:02.320 --> 41:06.440]  anybody informed anybody who's manly anybody that wants to survive anybody
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.800]  that wants to thrive anybody that knows how government works or knows the three
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.280]  branches of government anybody who's red blooded anybody that'll fight anybody
[41:13.280 --> 41:16.200]  that isn't gonna roll over you want to point your finger and say where's the
[41:16.200 --> 41:21.600]  scum or the problem good you're right I am the problem I am bad media matters

[41:26.000 --> 41:30.240]  to fake the ratings numbers to show every libertarian or conservative site
[41:30.240 --> 41:34.200]  losing 90% of its viewers or readers when our own internal metrics were
[41:34.200 --> 41:38.880]  spiking and exploding at all-time highs and you were too dumb to even get Alexa
[41:38.880 --> 41:42.360]  to change their internal subscription service where you could actually get the
[41:42.360 --> 41:47.760]  numbers showing on over 70% increase in traffic in just the last month you stinking
[41:47.760 --> 41:57.080]  liars you think you heard us you think we sell advertising off of ratings off

[55:13.080 --> 55:17.040]  gonna be lowered kids in the ground over this bowl of inbrewed in grave digger
[55:17.040 --> 55:22.800]  and Obama will be the hero I told you I'd be the villain why now says I'm bad I'm
[55:22.800 --> 55:29.000]  being attacked don't you know what a joke last few weeks we know how it works
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.600]  as we'll sit here and point out who the killers are we don't care
[55:38.320 --> 55:44.000]  the range right-wing conspiracy theory Obama intentionally wants to infect the
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.080]  nation with Ebola gene I'm not a rocket scientist though I do interview a lot of
[55:51.080 --> 55:58.000]  them they concur with my analysis the late Bob Bowman or meta-star wars if you
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.120]  bring in a bunch of people from Africa where they're all falling down and
[56:01.120 --> 56:04.160]  they're projecting millions are gonna get it and other countries won't let them
[56:04.160 --> 56:08.440]  in but Latin America and the US advertised that we are the Ebola toilet
[56:08.440 --> 56:14.280]  and that you can come here to die and bleed out in our hospital well you know
[56:14.280 --> 56:20.520]  what's gonna happen is we're gonna get Ebola that's why the default was that
[56:20.520 --> 56:24.680]  was against the law and still was but see we live in a country now where the
[56:24.680 --> 56:28.040]  southern border is wide open and they've told the kids of the world come here
[56:28.040 --> 56:31.240]  with your families will give you free passage and send you to a Democratic
[56:31.240 --> 56:36.720]  party home and pay them $7,000 a month to keep three of you as a business and
[56:36.720 --> 56:40.360]  then we'll give you voter IDs and judges unanimously a struck it down no
[56:40.360 --> 56:45.360]  voter ID and you can vote to do whatever you want in this country and it
[56:45.360 --> 56:53.960]  works like a charm so I'm no rocket scientist I don't always drink beer but
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.640]  when I do it's not no suckies you know the most interesting man I'm not a
[56:58.640 --> 57:06.280]  rocket scientist but I know that when I know I'm stating the obvious I'm just
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.120]  gonna keep stating it like an emergency alert alert alert we're letting him let
[57:11.120 --> 57:17.280]  me talk in an Obama friendly voice I don't know why our Lord and Savior
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.840]  Barack Hussein Obama the long legged Mac Daddy the Savior of the planet
[57:22.840 --> 57:29.160]  according to Jamie Foxx his bishop I don't know why they would bring in all
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.160]  these people from hot zones when everyone else is banning it and I don't
[57:33.160 --> 57:36.160]  know why they would bring in medical workers that have it when they never did
[57:36.160 --> 57:39.920]  that before they would keep them on ships or at clinics overseas so they
[57:39.920 --> 57:45.360]  were better in country I don't know why they're bringing them in to the United
[57:45.360 --> 57:50.600]  States and into medical centers and not even putting them in high-containment
[57:50.600 --> 57:55.720]  facilities that would stop the spread they just must not know that bringing
[57:55.720 --> 57:58.800]  people in with Ebola might spread it they must just not know they're
[57:58.800 --> 58:03.400]  violating set laws and common sense I guess all of us know how to stop it but
[58:03.400 --> 58:08.920]  Obama didn't you're right White House in media matters it's deranged it's crazy
[58:08.920 --> 58:13.560]  because you use the word like a man in the Sahara Desert wanting to have a glass
[58:13.560 --> 58:18.040]  of water that's crazy too or wanting to have health and security for your kids
[58:18.040 --> 58:22.280]  that's nuts are finding out about the secret death panels for veterans those
[58:22.280 --> 58:27.320]  are gonna stay you're right I've been an extremist I'm sorry I got upset and
[58:27.320 --> 58:31.960]  tried to wake people up and didn't like abortion 54 million dead babies you're
[58:31.960 --> 58:36.280]  right that's a wonderful thing that we killed all those babies too I want to be

[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:11.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:19.360]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.280]  texas alex jones
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.360]  I meant to do this yesterday we have a map we have a timeline of the Ebola
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:36.400]  outbreak in the US and we have a calendar I'll do that with James Wesley
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.320]  Rawls coming up at the bottom of the hour but roughly a patient zero got here
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:46.720]  three weeks ago ran around vomiting and everywhere we now know he left Liberia
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.240]  knowing he had Ebola or thinking he did went to the hospital vomited all over his
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:57.000]  house and his kids all over the neighbors stairwells ambulance drivers at
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.080]  least two nurses got it from him now in Dallas and so you can do the math three
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:08.280]  weeks is like 21 days in fact it is 21 days so he gets here roughly three weeks
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:18.760]  ago and so he starts spreading it 21 days ago he gets in the hospital two
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.040]  weeks ago he dies last Wednesday so right around now the government's brought
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:28.560]  the people in they've got enough spread this is right around the time that you
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.280]  will expect like I said yesterday to see Obama making announcements and them
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.240]  saying oh it's really bad get ready for it to spread everywhere after they let it
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:41.120]  in and made sure it could happen and had some plausible deniability I mean they
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.160]  may be out there releasing it for all we know I mean this is a very evil group
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.720]  of people in fact we would all be fools not to think they're probably behind it
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:54.440]  Obama cancels trip to meet on Ebola outbreak President Barack Obama the AP
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.040]  is reporting is canceling political travel that means raising money to meet
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:04.280]  with his cabinet on the Ebola outbreak oh oh he's gonna save us in the new
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.680]  Obamacare system is gonna allow the coordination with the locals to stop it
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.520]  and I predict it will spread but they will stop it and then they will be
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.760]  hailed and give each other awards for bringing the Ebola in and they'll bring
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.680]  in medical tyranny and forced inoculation oh they're gonna save us
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:27.280]  they're so good the White House says the Lord and Savior as Amy Fox calls him
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.200]  Obama is calling off a planned trip to New Jersey and Connecticut instead will
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:36.760]  convene cabinet officials not servants coordinating the government's Ebola
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.800]  response at the White House the change comes as a second health worker in
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.640]  Dallas provided care for the first Ebola patient the illegal diagnosed in the
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.080]  US has tested positive for the disease Obama had planned to speak at a fundraiser
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.920]  for Senate Democrats in Union New Jersey and then headline a rally for
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:08.480]  Connecticut governor Daniel Malloy this is like the matrix I mean I was just
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.280]  watching it unfold and they brought it in they did everything they could to
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.360]  spread it and now they're openly trying to create a catastrophe so they can
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.880]  grandstand because they know 37% of the public or whatever it is in Gallup
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:25.280]  can't name one branch of government legislative executive judicial they
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.680]  don't know what state and federal government are they don't know what rights
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.040]  are they don't know anything but sports center with all these men in suits all
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.920]  so serious debating all the numbers and all the scores which shows men could
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:43.520]  know all this but they think the whole world is sports and I harp on the sports
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.600]  because it was the only area men are allowed to be dominant where men can
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:52.320]  sit on the podium where men can talk where you can still have you know
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:04:00.080]  violence it's the only kosher acceptable little venue but everywhere else
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:06.600]  any sign of male masculinity or strength or virility is racist is homophobic is
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.920]  hurtful to women why a man kissing his girlfriend and her falling in his arms
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.160]  is sexual assault doesn't matter if you think that doesn't make sense it isn't
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:19.440]  meant to make sense they're overriding us they're screwing up the species they
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.720]  are they are using our social behavior we're like dogs pack creatures they're
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.560]  using our normal tribal conformity against us to put us into systems meant
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.560]  to destroy us that's all I can say we have psychopathic technocratic
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.000]  controllers in control and they're going after everybody just because you work
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.920]  for the system does it mean you're in some high horse or that you aren't in
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.840]  the crosshairs in fact if you look at the historical metrics of a tyranny

[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:52.360]  second nurse in Dallas was flying all over the country visiting family was
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:09:00.400]  going to Ohio and other areas and this Ebola outbreak as I said last week is
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.640]  an October surprise the Hill is now saying that and that both parties are
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:11.280]  battling with each other over the response well Barack Obama and the CDC
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.120]  are criminally negligent bare minimum that's not my view it's a fact the default
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.560]  laws we've written articles about it the default procedures are what England and
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.920]  France did two months ago when this hit epidemic levels in West Africa stop all
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.280]  the flights from there and tell anybody if you're originating out of a West
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.480]  African country you're going to be turned away when you get here instead we got
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.800]  people flying in here obviously sick fleeing to get medical care from
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.360]  collapsing countries like Liberia vomiting all over the planes two weeks ago
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.400]  airline workers and airline cleaning crews went on strike and they said
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.240]  because we go on the planes there's vomit everywhere it's safe to say with
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.640]  collapsing countries that we just haven't learned yet in the last 21 days
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:57.800]  they're probably covering up other Ebola cases around the country I said
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.160]  undoubtedly these nurses are going to get it they said you had to vomit do an
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.360]  open wound that's not true that was a bowl of 30 years ago this Ebola has
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:10.680]  mutated over 330 times now it is spreading the UN estimates 1.4
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:14.520]  million will get it some German estimates by top urology institutions are
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:23.720]  5 million will die will die I don't know all I know is they're still saying hey
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.520]  you can come here if you're from West Africa we might finally put some people
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:33.080]  screening for fevers or whatever but one of you people are just on business from
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.400]  these West African countries and don't know they have it it incubates for 21
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:45.760]  days not three so this isn't the 1980s or 1990s or 2000s Ebola it's new they
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.040]  believe it can survive longer in particular namely bat feces and urine
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.960]  raining from the sky that's probably what's spreading it most top scientists
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.400]  you can look it up see when the Washington Post believe that if it gets
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.720]  into mammals here oh my gosh you've got compromised immune systems with all the
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:05.840]  flu shots that lower your immunity on record they're saying take the flu shot
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.600]  so you won't get quarantined and mistaken with a respiratory illness how
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.280]  this starts with flu like symptoms so they're now pushing the flu shot with
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.200]  it unprecedented now the UN says it can become a global catastrophe if it isn't
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:25.640]  stopped in 60 days the answers give them more funding Ohio Health Department
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:31.160]  says the Texas second Texas nurse traveled there and spent time there
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:41.600]  from October 8th to the 13th now joining us is James Wesley Rawls and he has
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:46.240]  been again a top survivalist since his he's been a survivalist as teenagers
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.480]  in his tops travels for decades survival blog comms is very popular website he
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:53.620]  has a bachelor of arts degree from San Jose State University with a minor
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.720]  degree in military science history military history former U.S. Army
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.760]  intelligence officer we're on top secret security clearances with special
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.680]  background investigation and access to sensitive compartmentalized information
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.880]  he was awarded officer specialty 35 a tactical all-some intelligence officer
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.920]  and additional skills then a fire 5m electronic warfare officer he achieved
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.840]  the rank of captain of the Army NBC defense officer schools we can speak
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.960]  to Ebola as nuclear chemical biological as well as the northern warfare school
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:26.960]  at Fort Greeley Alaska but really where he's been successful is in the market of
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.640]  ideas with millions of survivors one of the top survivalist out there and a
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.200]  best-selling fiction and nonfiction writer with a string of New York Times
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.840]  bestsellers under his belt and a very popular guest on this show so I want to
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.880]  thank him for coming on he won't even have his face seen for really a decade
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:48.480]  he believes the collapse is so serious and that the threat of bio warfare
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.520]  nuclear you name it and and here he is now to speak to all this he had his last
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.320]  bestseller out about ex-patriots his new one is about a fictional liberator
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.080]  group that I guess takes the country back after collapse or 1776 part 2 he'll
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.520]  give us a little sneak peek on those books coming out at the end of the month
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.360]  the new book the liberators but I tell you James I want to get your take on
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.280]  this I don't know your take yet but mine is bottom line they are criminally
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.000]  negligent I believe they did this on purpose knowing they could let it
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.560]  spread it be a good political diversion even if it makes Obama look bad it
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:28.400]  diverts from Benghazi from fast and furious from IRS gate from all his
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:33.760]  executive orders on coal power plants I mean he's making a move right now and
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.200]  again the bureaucracy stands again getting more power from this but I mean
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.800]  heads need to roll when when we start low lowering more Americans into
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:47.000]  coffins into the ground we need to punish this disgusting bureaucracy not
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  reward it with more funding because they quote screwed up the Ebola outbreak of
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.160]  2014 well Alex I think you're certainly right that there's criminal negligence
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:03.360]  it remains to be seen whether or not the introduction of Ebola into the country
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.800]  was intentional that may be very difficult and down but you're certainly
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:13.280]  right about it being criminally negligent the everything the administration
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:19.960]  has done has exacerbated this problem and we are on the fast track to a full
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:25.160]  blown pandemic a global pandemic there are so many unanswered questions about
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:32.280]  Ebola that it makes my head spin there's it's uncertain how long this virus can
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:38.520]  survive on surfaces it's uncertain how long it remains in the system of someone
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:44.040]  who is quote recovered unquote there's some evidence that it might even be a
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:51.600]  chronic venereal disease and given the you know that the sexual practices in
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:58.080]  Africa that doesn't bode well at least for the African continent and that's
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.680]  right for those that don't know just to back you up it can live in the sperm now
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.440]  or the testicles for 70 days and they do now officially in the deeper literature
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:13.200]  call it basically a venereal disease keep going well yeah and but the key
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.960]  question is can it be easily transmitted through the air not just with what with
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:26.240]  vomit not just with blood but with just very fine droplets from breathing if
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:33.680]  that's the case we could have a pandemic that is very very difficult to stop and
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:39.240]  from a preparedness standpoint every American citizen needs to think very
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:44.240]  seriously about how they would go about self-quarantining their family to
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:50.840]  protect themselves from that's I also think it's important to let the feds
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.480]  know they've clearly been standing down or still standing down and when tens of
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.120]  thousands of Americans contract this and die from it or maybe even millions if it
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.880]  keeps going down this road that's where it is going now folks we can now
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.760]  officially say this is on the fast track to global pandemic and our government
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.520]  has stood down and they need to know that we are going to hold them
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:17.400]  accountable one way or another and if they get that message that we know
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.920]  they're behind it they may back off and actually try to contain it now but James
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.880]  it may be too late if hundreds and hundreds of people have been exposed
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.600]  if more people are coming in out of West Africa every day by the hundreds they
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:35.040]  report who knows how many patient zeros there could actually be out there well
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.920]  yes it we basically lost control of the situation by not sealing our borders
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:46.600]  early you know the president should have been calling Madagascar months ago
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.600]  and now it's going to come down to individual families having to do the
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:56.960]  same thing and you know contain themselves so they don't so they don't
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:01.720]  get exposed to it it's going to be an economic catastrophe of nothing else can
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.080]  you imagine what's going to happen to retail in this country to movie theater
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.960]  chains to organize sporting events to concerts no one's going to want to go
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:17.800]  out public once this gets spread so it's going to shut down our economy if
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:24.520]  nothing else which they've been moving to shut down what provided 52% of our
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.040]  power now it's 30 something coal they're moving to shut down our industry
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.640]  with regulations and taxes obama cares meant to shut things down classic
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.520]  clowered and piven agenda 21 to make us dependent I mean this fits right into
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:42.520]  the plan to implode the country James it certainly does and you mentioned power
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.960]  production that really is the linchpin and as I mentioned in one of my previous
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:51.080]  interviews with you if the power grids go down all bets are off then we could
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:57.880]  see a total economic collapse not just a depression and in the case of Ebola if
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:04.200]  it gets widespread enough that people are afraid to go to work if some of those
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.440]  people are going to be public utility employees people who work at nuclear
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.520]  power plants people who work at coal fire plants people who work at natural
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:18.240]  gas fired plants and all of those require a certain level of staffing and in the
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:22.280]  case of nuclear power which is predominant on the east coast if there
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:29.880]  isn't a threshold of staffing that is met by nrc regulations those nuclear
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:38.320]  power plants have to be shut down by law so I think we could very well see a not
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:44.960]  a full-blown martial law situation but a sort of selective martial law where in
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.640]  the employees of hospitals are sent are essentially going to become indentured
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:56.480]  servants and perhaps even the other public service employees police officers
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:02.160]  firefighters and the employees in the power industry are essentially going to
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:09.760]  be required to show up for work and they might even be housed overnight they
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.360]  might be taken away from their families and not being allowed to be allowed to
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:21.200]  commute basically be captive at their positions if things get bad enough and
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:27.120]  I given the proclivities of the Obama administration I I don't think they would
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:31.520]  hesitate at all to do that if they think they can get away with it and have the
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.200]  controlled media and media matters somehow blame me and I mean they actually
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.240]  are saying that I'm crazy for saying Ebola would spread and then and that
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.720]  Obama wants it to be here intentionally well by default that's what
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.600]  they're doing and even though Obama's a puppet the buck stops with him and this
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:52.440]  is the first administration we've ever had that was clearly purposely trying to
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.800]  destroy the country so sorry stay there we got to go to break when I come right

[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.720]  charlottes willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.920]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born by Patriots supply has never taken
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:25.200]  a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities

[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.600]  tyranny against free speech what we need is real freedom
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:32.000]  Thomas Jefferson style George Washington style James Wesley Rawls is our guest
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.480]  survival blog dot com one of the top survivalist and best-selling authors
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.320]  former U.S. Army Intelligence captain and he's with us he got cut off by the
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:45.720]  break he was trying to jump him with a point on my point if you just joined
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:51.440]  us that this is now premeditated even if it was incompetence before they are
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:57.840]  taking the second Ebola nurse patient to Atlanta to a little bit better facility
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:02.640]  but the default was level four emergency facilities or an aircraft carrier
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.720]  with people the medical workers in the military that have basically volunteered
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:10.320]  when they signed up for something this hazardous now now that now from my
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:14.680]  reading of the law and common sense and default that's why I think it is a
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.720]  conspiracy James is if you have defaults in position and you don't send kids to
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.600]  school they have the flu but you send them to school when they have Ebola I
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.560]  mean they just can't perfectly screw up this bad statistically I mean I know you
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.720]  don't want to go there and say you think it stays but I mean I want your real
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.840]  view this is really starting to look bad and then please continue with your
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:44.640]  point well I think it is about as bad as it could get given public policy
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:52.040]  in the great chess game of politics I think that they every move they made
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.720]  with Ebola has been in the direction of
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:03.440]  furthering this pandemic the decisions they should have made months ago weren't
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:10.480]  made and repeatedly they've been they've been making bad call after bad call and
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.560]  the public that the generally dumb public the GDP as I like to call them
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.400]  are the ones that are going to suffer so people need to not only hold up their
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.520]  elected representatives accountable but at this point they're gonna have to
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.520]  bend for themselves well that's what I was about to say look at Katrina look at
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.560]  the hurricane a few years ago in New York FEMA said closed for bad weather it
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:40.320]  was a joke I mean they never protect this they my god how bad is it gonna get
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.520]  if it really breaks out and affects a hundred thousand people and that'll
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:49.040]  create total panic James yes it will and and just the perception of the
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.920]  pandemic will be just as bad as the pandemic itself because it will cause
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:27:00.000]  an economic chain reaction that will that will take down retail it'll take
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.520]  down all public events and eventually the economy is just going to come to a
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:13.440]  screeching halt it if people are afraid to go out in public the economy is bound
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:20.400]  to at least slow down and probably collapse but then they can blame the
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.480]  derivatives and the wars and everything though on Ebola they could blame the
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:31.400]  global crash on Ebola and politically get out of a economic reset James it is
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:36.400]  possible yes and in fact it could be used as the excuse for a lot of different
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:42.400]  things for example one thing that most people haven't considered is that the
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.400]  currency that we carry carries germs with it and if there's a pandemic they
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:55.040]  could say oh well this is the perfect excuse to institute a cashless society
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:02.360]  so if you you're talking early about power given strategy we're looking at
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:07.760]  multiple gains for the New World Order coming out of this the cashless
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:14.920]  society further globalization of governance selective martial law there's
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.920]  a lot of things that could come out of this that are very bad for the American
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:27.120]  people economically very bad for our personal liberty we should be quite
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.920]  concerned about this and taking proactive steps not just politically but
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:39.800]  also every family needs to have their own preparation squared away and people
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:45.680]  need to make contingency plans to hunker down in place for a period of months if
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:52.440]  need be to let this thing burn itself out if it goes airborne and is spread
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:59.240]  through casual contact it will require hunkering down in place for months and
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:04.840]  the logistics that go along with that are pretty daunting just being able to
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:10.160]  handle your your personal mail for example so you can pay your bills will
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:16.920]  be a challenge just in itself and it doesn't make me have a lot of confidence
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:20.000]  knowing who the president is while this is all happening the very group that
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.920]  helped orchestrate it and I see this as a biological medical 9-11 just as they
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.080]  use 9-11 to overthrow much of the Bill of Rights and Constitution they're
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.480]  going to use this now as a rollout of Obamacare claiming federalization was
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.440]  the savior they're already saying that so we can see them writing the script I
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.880]  want to shift gears into geopolitical developments as well economic
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.960]  developments with James Leslie Rawls tell you about a couple of his new books

[01:29:53.080 --> 01:30:01.760]  Jones and the GCN radio network I began to get into iodine a few years ago
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:06.240]  because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify most

[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:08.200]  now they're public about it homeland security is for anyone loyal to the
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:14.000]  Republic anyone who's a good person because in a society of criminals who
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.720]  are you worried about you want to take over society you want to feed on the
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.920]  sheep you don't like sheep dogs you want to hunt them down so I got news for all
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:27.200]  of you you're going to have your pension funds taken if you don't bring down the
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.880]  globalist you're going to end up being a slave that's their default plan and
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.760]  they don't stop they love to usurp they love to take over and the
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.040]  constellation of global crises triggering the Arab Spring funding al-Qaeda
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:46.120]  renaming it starting a war with Russia accelerating I mean the new taxes folks
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.720]  for those that actually run a company and have employees I mean it's just it's
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.600]  just devastating if I expand or do anything under a cruel it I like pay
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.440]  more taxes than money I make personally literally it wasn't like that four years
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:08.160]  ago I mean they are shutting the country down with Obamacare companies are
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:13.240]  closing everywhere this is all designed to shut us down because the big globalist
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:17.280]  corporations are exempt only they can operate it's like decompressing an
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:20.920]  airplane and then you've got an oxygen mask and you hijack it and take it to
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.920]  your home country that's what they're doing is they're draining the oxygen out
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:29.560]  of the country they've got political mask oxygen here's the analogy or the
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:33.920]  parable or the allegory and then they get the whole infrastructure the
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:37.400]  globalist and clowered and pivot and we just use that because it's popularized
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.120]  it's in hundreds of sociological papers to cut off the economy make you
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:46.320]  dependent on government it's basic domestication that's what agenda 21 UN
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:50.800]  treaty is shut off everything but what the elites control it is the equivalent
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:59.120]  of a financial political sociological cultural spiritual neutron bomb and by
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.600]  the way Jimmy Carter didn't ban neutron bombs the Russians didn't either they
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:06.200]  produced whole generations of high-tech neutron bombs I've had top former
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.080]  nuclear weapons developers on who've been able to talk about it because part of
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.280]  it's been leaked they can't release classified info but if somebody else's
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.880]  accidentally released they can talk about it they're well beyond high-tech
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.920]  neutron bombs they've even developed any matter weapons that was in the San
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:28.120]  Francisco Chronicle the Air Force leaked that eight years ago this is crazy
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:34.520]  town and so the point I'm getting it is you and I have cognitive dissonance
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.640]  because we don't think like that we think about prosperity and happiness and
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:49.760]  like people doing good the globalists don't this is the real deal now in the
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.800]  political fight there's a chance I'm gonna get James Wesley Rawls take on
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.480]  this and give them the floor on other issues if we come out call the White
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:00.200]  House call Congress call the media and say the defaults haven't been followed
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:04.680]  which is now starting to be admitted in Bloomberg AP and others you're supposed
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:07.040]  to quarantine these people and everybody that's been in contact with them
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:11.240]  immediately you're supposed to stop the flights if we make a big enough issue
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.400]  out of this they may stop the flights they don't want to do that though till
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:18.360]  it's clearly already here and spreading because they want this crisis to not go
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.560]  to waste I mean that's default they're now on purpose doing this they may not
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:27.480]  have up front but they clearly are now in my view if we put enough pressure on
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.320]  them they have to back off and I printed up and they're now coming in from the
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:36.280]  US manufacturer so you can order them right now Ebola on the front with the
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.680]  Obama symbol in the O of the rising Sun and then it says obola on the back now
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:46.880]  MSNBC with no viewers they say they control reality they say no one is you
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.960]  know allowed to say this you're racist well good we have a limited number
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.720]  without the blood splatters on it a limited number with the blood splatters

[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:10.480]  experts what to do you know the real science not the hype by protecting
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.800]  yourself from Ebola not just from the immune system angle but but from the
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:18.120]  sheltering in place angle so I know where I'm gonna be tonight I'm going back
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:23.800]  to Cabela's I'm getting more storable food because if it isn't this crisis it
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.000]  shows our government and other governments are totally inept but I
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.240]  don't know how they're gonna get away with France and Germany and other
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.200]  African countries sealing their borders stopping the flights but we didn't
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.560]  James you've got the floor to finish up with what an Ebola spread could look
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:42.640]  like other economic collapse data we've got with the dollar what you think about
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.360]  Russia what you think about ISIS all of this you've got the floor for the
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:52.600]  balance of the hour James Wesley Rawls well thank you Alex I think that your
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:59.680]  listeners are gonna be head and shoulders above most Americans because most of
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.440]  your listeners are well-prepared individuals they're prepared for their
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:10.800]  families nutritionally but in terms of food storage and supplements there are
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:18.880]  folks that are are not buying the big lie and folks that will be prepared to
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:28.200]  shelter in place if the Ebola pandemic multiplies the way I anticipate folks
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.880]  need to be looking at this both from a political standpoint and a practical
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:39.040]  standpoint and the practical measures that people have to take are at this
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:46.040]  point pretty evident one thing that a lot of people have overlooked is the just
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:54.160]  the sheer number of pairs of nitrile gloves and and booty shoe covers that
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:43:03.040]  people are going to have to stock so that they can at least you know I go out
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:10.720]  and get their mail safely people need to think about food storage about water
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:20.440]  filtration you'll certainly need a N95 or better a mask there's some evidence
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:29.080]  that the Ebola virus only measures 80 nanometers and an N95 mask has and has
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:34.760]  passed through apertures of about 200 nanometers so what you're really looking
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:40.080]  at is something better than an N95 mask so you're either going to want to have
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:46.520]  a full mil spec mask or you're going to have what's called it an N99 or N100
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:53.200]  mask to protect from Ebola if Ebola can be transmitted through the skin that
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:44:01.280]  means you're going to need a full suit full face coverage and the decontamination
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.960]  procedures that you're going to need to follow are going to be fairly
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:12.920]  complicated folks need to be you know stock up on at least a decent quality
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:19.160]  disinfectant like Lysol and spray bottles whoever is going to be the
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.600]  hapless volunteer who's who has to be in contact with the outside world for your
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:29.400]  family is is basically going to have to stand outside in full sunlight for a
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.000]  half hour after being in contact and be sprayed down three times successfully
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.560]  before they start to take off their protective gear and the expandable
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:46.600]  items like your booties that the covers for your shoes and your gloves are
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:52.520]  going to have to go right into an incinerator barrel and the other items
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:58.840]  after you get sprayed down three different times at successive times at
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:05.080]  five or ten minute intervals are going to have to be hung up in full sunlight on
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:12.600]  say your back porch or deck the decontamination procedures are
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.520]  fairly complicated people need to pick these things through they need to get
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:22.200]  a hold of the supplies they need now in another month things like nitrile gloves
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:29.200]  and N95 masks and booty covers and Tyvek suits are going to be virtually
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:33.800]  unobtainable they will either be completely sold out in the civilian
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:41.000]  market or they will be sidelined basically corralled into government
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:47.760]  service by executive order there if people haven't already stocked up they
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:52.160]  are behind the power curve so it's important that people think these things
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:59.520]  through that they stock up team up and be prepared to hunker down for an
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:06.800]  extended period of time that's right and again I've never been obsessed with the
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:11.000]  biological warfare threat until the last six seven years because I saw the
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.400]  movements the preparations for a biological catastrophe and I saw the
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.440]  political brainwashing in the media the preparations and then I saw the
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.840]  accelerated mutations of bacteria and viruses just wiping out people in mass
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:30.240]  every winter hospitals just full of mystery illnesses the last three four
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:35.000]  years I lost three family members this year to a mystery chest illness two of
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.160]  them that were in good shape and the hospital doctors said my god it's just
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:44.960]  regularly mutated bacteria just eating people's lungs and so even if this Ebola
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.000]  comes and passes like the angel of death which I pray it will government's doing
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.560]  as you said batting a thousand to make it as bad as possible which shows it's
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.520]  clearly on purpose folks you can't be so perfectly inept that you do the exact
[01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:02.840]  most horrible thing when it's easier to do the right thing and politically
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:07.000]  easier and everyone's telling you do it and you won't they're just we are in the
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.800]  hands of such evil people and I now just today realize the two old gas mask I've
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:18.000]  got that are M95s I got some for the kids but the two adult ones the candles
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.880]  and food and you know guns and all that I've got to go out and get the gloves the
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:28.760]  booties the tape I've got to prepare for all that stuff and just pray because if
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:33.280]  it gets out there and and here's why I'm really concerned James they said you
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:36.800]  have to vomit into an open wound or all this and they had the Texas board say
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:41.360]  last week we have the clip that you know it's basically zero chance you can get
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.880]  it and then two nurses got it clearly it's gotten more veral clearly it's
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:50.160]  spreading it's got to be hundreds of times worse than the previous one that
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.160]  was 30 something people this is now 4,000 plus dead probably a whitewash number
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:58.920]  about millions getting it something has changed with the Ebola and it's
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:03.800]  surviving longer in particular maybe it's gone somewhat airborne maybe it dies
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:08.440]  in five minutes in sunlight I don't know but you know they said oh that's
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.480]  Africans they're under nurse that's why it's killing them well it's killing
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:15.680]  people and people are getting over here what does your gut tell you James being
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.520]  an NBC in the army you know doing the research writing about this for decades
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.400]  talking to all the other experts a lot of top virologists are saying they
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:27.960]  believe it's beginning to go somewhat airborne meaning it's not hardy but that
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.840]  the virus itself like you said can float around in very small you know
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:39.200]  globulets of mucus or spit and that it's it's it's crossed some bridge clearly
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:44.880]  it takes 21 days to chestache clearly it's going longer something's happened
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:49.200]  James it's getting stronger I don't think we can debate that can we no I think
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:55.120]  it clearly has had some mutations the question is it has there been a receptor
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:00.960]  mutation that would make it more easily transmissible with just a droplet
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:08.880]  contact in your skin for example if it's a case of of a virus that can that
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:15.000]  could only be transmitted if it touches a mucus membrane or your eye then you
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.440]  might have a pretty good chance of having this thing stop but if it's if it's
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.840]  something where just one droplet touches the human skin and can be absorbed then
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:31.080]  we're in trouble or if it's something that can survive inside the proboscis of
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:40.480]  a mosquito and and or an extended period of time say anywhere from one to 24
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.840]  hours then we're in deep deep trouble well I think it clearly can if it's
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:52.400]  living in testicles or in sperm for 70 days James well so we basically have
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.640]  to prepare for the worst and pray for the best and we need to if nothing else
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:02.600]  pray for God's providence and protection for individual families because it may
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:09.960]  come down to that we need to get right with God pray fervently about this and
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:14.160]  then listen to the Holy Spirit you know if you feel convicted to prepare folks
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:19.080]  get ready get the food well I've been feeling it for about a year and I've
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:22.040]  told everybody I think really I've never talked like this I think the hammers
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:25.280]  about to come down I feel it right now I don't even know if it's this it might
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.200]  be something else because you notice just all these crises are now unfolding
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:37.640]  right now James well yes we're kind of kind of on the cost of a crisis here a
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:41.880]  major crisis and there's been a lot of different factors that they're all
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:48.600]  playing into it economic sociological political and now
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:53.040]  epidemiological yep James stay there I want to ask you about their vaccine

[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:10.040]  targeting conservative websites question mark I don't think there's any
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.320]  question mark about it but it's an excellent article by Don Salazar we
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:17.080]  subscribe to it to track it as one rating service and our internal number
[01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:20.760]  which we show the graph shows we're exploding but the public number they put
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:24.560]  out shows us losing like 90% of our audience same with drudge world net
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.840]  daily everybody else while media matters MSNBC that we dwarf explode I mean
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:36.640]  this is just totally staged and it just shows how rigged things are going back
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.560]  to James Wesley Rawls will be with us five minutes the next hour then it's
[01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:42.360]  your calls I want to talk about his new book coming out at the end of the month
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:48.040]  liberators James what do you make of the head of the NIH have the article right
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:52.880]  here comes out and says we may need to deploy the vaccine the entire community
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.720]  dr. Anthony Fauci director of the US National Institute of for allergy and
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:02.480]  infectious disease the National Institute of Health wants to vaccinate the
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.760]  whole country with an experimental Ebola vaccine that just so happens is going to
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:12.200]  come out in December the first I guess somewhat not approved but ready for
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:18.200]  distribution well that's right on time James well all I can say to folks is be
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:25.400]  aware because the history of vaccinations in this country is just
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:36.040]  checkered with horror stories of contaminated inoculants there and even
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:44.520]  if they had a successful Ebola virus vaccination who's to say what else could
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:51.080]  be in it that would have long-term deletorias of facts I would recommend
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:57.920]  that people not take that inoculation I think it'd be foolish of them I would
[01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:08.320]  much rather wait and and hunker down with my family here at my ranch then go
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:12.960]  in and take that inoculation that that is absolute insanity well look in
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.920]  California last year they admitted that the MMR shot was giving people what it
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:20.880]  supposedly treated a lot of these new vaccines are actually live viruses I
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.800]  mean I wouldn't trust this group I wouldn't trust Billa Melinda Gates in
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:29.160]  Monsanto and it's not that we don't believe that there's some science behind
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:33.680]  an inoculation theory it's 500 years old with smallpox it's that we can't trust
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:40.240]  this group with their whole history of secret testing right yeah there's there
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:46.720]  is great cause for concern and I think that it's it would be a foolish of people
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:52.640]  to just rush out and take this inoculation who knows there could be as
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:59.400]  you mentioned live virus contamination so in instead of stopping a pandemic they
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:06.000]  could actually be proliferating it into all 50 states with their own inoculation
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:12.880]  so folks need to be aware and they need to be in prayer as well that we need God's
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:18.760]  protection for this oh I just I have three children I have a lot of family I
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:23.040]  know a lot of you do too out there it makes me beyond angry it's just so
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:26.640]  disgusting they haven't shut down those flights because James's Africa continues
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:30.800]  to collapse more gonna come we may be able to contain this but not all the new

[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:30.240]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:46.440]  man I tell you it's just so hard to watch this country degenerate this whole
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:50.120]  west is degenerating it's television it's a people are spectators now they
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:55.000]  just don't have the spark and those that do are the enemy where the milk cows
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.440]  we're supposed to do the work do all the thinking and then the attack ball of
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.960]  parasites above and below it's just a really bad situation James Leslie
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:07.760]  Rawls other points briefly on Russia on ISIS and tell us about your new book
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:13.680]  that's coming out well in terms of Russia and Ukraine I think that there
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:22.080]  will probably be a announced political solution for the Ukraine crisis but the
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:32.800]  long-term power game has not gone away there's there's still a huge chess game
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:39.080]  going on behind the scenes and the end result of that will probably turn out to
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:47.440]  be in tilting in the direction of global governance in terms of ISIS boy we're
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:56.720]  just seeing the beginning of a spread of the caliphate I would not be surprised
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:02:06.760]  at all to see most or all of Iraq fall to ISIS and let's face it you can't spell
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:16.840]  crisis without ISIS they want to use this to as an excuse for a continued
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:21.840]  American military presence in the Middle East that will go on for decades and it's
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:27.200]  just another enemy du jour that they've they that we created ourselves our own
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:35.040]  government created ISIS and now they set this puppet up as as the latest
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:43.640]  bogeyman to to justify a huge military expenditure and now Turkey is
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:47.360]  air striking the Kurds and says they won't fight ISIS I mean they're there
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.920]  letting ice is their proxy army they're just taking over it's incredible how
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:54.440]  dumb they think we are they're letting Ebola and they're running al-Qaeda under
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:03:00.120]  the name ISIS tell us about your new book coming out well yeah on the 21st of
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:05.480]  October my latest novel liberators comes out it's in the Patriots novel series
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:10.160]  it's the fifth book in the series and like the others it's that parallel to
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.600]  the others it's that just in the near future but the geography is different in
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:21.720]  this case it's set primarily in the upper peninsula of Michigan and in Western
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:27.800]  Canada in British Columbia in the area called Bella Kula and I think folks will
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:32.720]  find it instructive on a number of different levels I went pretty heavily
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:38.720]  into both intelligence analysis and guerrilla warfare tactics in this novel
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.600]  and I'm probably not going to make any friends in the Eastern establishment
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:48.280]  with this novel but you know it just like your radio show Alex they cannot
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:54.000]  stop the signal it's four of my books have become New York Times bestsellers

[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:44.760]  bit of hope for the political process also things are looking a little more

[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:09.160]  a lot more but finishing up with james leslie rolls who was an army
[02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:14.520]  intelligence bestselling author for new york times bestsellers the military
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.680]  has always been one of the most await groups when 10 percent of the public on
[02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:20.680]  average knew that the federal reserve was private
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:24.520]  maybe half the military i would talk to enlisted
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:27.560]  commissioned officers it really didn't matter they were moral weight to the
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:30.760]  general public they certainly knew that vaccines were
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.600]  experimental and killing people because they were getting pigs
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:38.680]  then i would just walk down the street in austin or dallas or new york city and
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:42.200]  almost every military person would run up whether they were an officer or not
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:48.280]  saying they were a listener and then it started to be police doing this
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.880]  and not just some police that recognized me most police i would end up walking
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:56.760]  by or talking to in a restaurant turned out to start you know becoming awake
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:01.960]  and then now i was in hot springs arkansas last year
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:07.320]  and they were having a military convention there
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:11.000]  of different types of specialists and they were also having a water convention
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.800]  there while i was there and i ran into most of the water convention people
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:18.920]  and they were all aware of fluoride being bad being a fraud and causing brain
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:22.440]  damage and i ran the military and they told me all about 70 to 80 percent are
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:25.320]  awake well now a year later i talk to military and
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:29.240]  they go about 90 percent are awake and i mean they know about the ndaa
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:32.280]  they know about the fema camps they know about the gun control they know about
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:35.320]  a jitter 21 and clowered and pivot they know about the plan to shut off the
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:37.720]  power plants they know our government's funding isis
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:41.080]  and said no last year remember that all the military holding up science thing i
[02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:46.120]  won't fight for al-qaeda i don't know what the establishment does
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.520]  when they've tried to form the military into an army to take over domestically
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:53.400]  and they've tried to militarize the police which they've done but in the
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:58.040]  process it decompartmentalized them because the last five six years
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:02.840]  james as you know we broke a lot of this but now it's mainstream news they come
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:06.600]  to them and actually say christians are bad gun owners are bad the founding
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.400]  fathers were bad it's like something you'd expect to
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:13.240]  see in the red dawn movie when they show the reeducation camp at the sport
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:15.880]  stadium with the movie screens going george
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:20.280]  washington was a pig gun owners are bad capitalism is bad
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:23.720]  the propaganda of the people running things
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:27.800]  is so horrible it makes you think they're inept because this is the stuff
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:32.200]  bad guys would tell the military i think their attempt to demonize the liberty
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:35.320]  movement james has totally backfired on them
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.400]  and is strategically one of the biggest defeats they've had
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:42.840]  you have a lot of military current and former what are they telling you
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:47.800]  do you concur do you disagree what's your view on the military waking up
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:50.440]  well everything that i've heard in recent years
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:55.480]  is in concurrence with what you've seen i have a lot of readers of my blog who
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.560]  are active duty military and they're all telling me the
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:02.760]  same thing that they they have woken up they
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:08.440]  have done their homework they can see what's really going on
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:13.240]  and they're no longer falling for for the lies that the administration is trying
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:17.080]  to push so it to me that indicates two things
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:22.840]  one is it's very encouraging because if they ever try to institute
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:25.640]  martial law they're not going to be able to do it with american
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:28.600]  troops they'll have to bring in overseas troops
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:31.640]  to try to institute martial law in this country because
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:36.200]  the american military is not going to put up with it
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.960]  there's too many people especially in the officer corps and that
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:44.280]  the non-commissioned officers who have have are fully awake
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:48.600]  and they're not going to go along with it
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:55.640]  secondarily everyone who leaves the military and you know
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:00.120]  very few people are our career military a lot of people just do their
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:04.760]  four to six years and they they get out there's a huge number of people
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:09.400]  who now have combat experience coming home from iraq coming from from
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:15.240]  afghanistan who um not only are politically aware
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:19.400]  but they also have a very advanced skill set
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.480]  in at least small unit tactics and and beyond
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:27.960]  so that um if we ever got into a situation where there was a war of
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:31.720]  resistance in america as i pointed out my novels
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:35.480]  all those returning veterans are going to are going to form
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:43.560]  the core cadre of the resistance we can depend on our our service members and
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:48.520]  we should support them individually but not support the policy
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:52.040]  that's right they always spend and say support whatever the globalist
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:55.480]  occupied government says that's not our military it's like hitler
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:58.360]  would say support the military well that means supporting hitler
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:02.760]  i mean our own military now trains to take on returning veterans
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:06.200]  where one week after you get out you're now enemy number one
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:09.320]  and they actually have the southern poverty law center and others
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:12.360]  with the fbi come in and give the troops these briefings that are so
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:17.560]  traitorous how do the feds not know james that these traitorous briefings
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.720]  where they say george washington wouldn't be welcome in today's army
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.200]  at fort hood i mean that that took the army intelligence units there because
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:28.760]  i know they give me a lot of info and they're for real
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:31.560]  they're not just giving me disinfo because i've checked it over the years
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:35.720]  when they started doing that they went from liking me and checking what i said
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:39.880]  and believing a lot of what i said to going oh my god the government really
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:45.400]  is at the top alien it really is totally fake i just don't know what's
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.080]  wrong with the socialist and the globalist that they think
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.040]  you can call troops in and say your new enemy is
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:55.720]  you know the america and george washington it's it's i mean
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.800]  george washington's on the purple heart he founded the u.s army
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:05.480]  i don't know how you do that well i think the the globalists are naive
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:11.320]  and they're all these strategic plans they have are going to come back and
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:16.120]  fight them because we still essentially have a liberty loving
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:20.920]  nation and our military reflects that
[02:15:20.920 --> 02:15:27.080]  in the long run we win they lose and that's very encouraging
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:30.200]  all right james well i'm glad you're getting the same good info i'm getting
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:33.720]  um but again it's not up to the military to get us out of this it's up to all of
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:38.040]  us to get ourselves out of this and to be very loud and very aggressive
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:40.600]  with the establishment let them know that they're going to get the blame for
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:43.320]  everything they may back off or you can make the decision to go
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:46.440]  underground and write best-selling books to reach out to people or you can be on
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:50.360]  the radio or do your own podcast whatever you do get active ladies and
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:54.040]  gentlemen we have the moral high ground we've been right over and over again
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:56.440]  not that it's hard the default is very simple
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:01.800]  james leslie rawls survival blog dot com i want to set you up right now before

[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:34.120]  and obama i mean they're just dishonorable scum who love to screw
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:39.720]  things up or create crises or let crises get worse so they get more power
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:43.160]  and i'm going to blame some people in the system
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:49.080]  if anybody else keeps dying from Ebola you say oh but car wrecks you know kill
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:54.600]  10 000 a month or whatever i get it though but this is premeditated
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:58.200]  and they're doing it on purpose and they're letting these people in and it
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.560]  isn't going to help africa and they're lying and turning off the default
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.840]  protections and folks if they get away with this is what i keep saying
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:07.960]  they get away with fashion furious and Benghazi and shutting off our power
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:12.200]  plants and teaching kids two plus two equals five
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:16.200]  the sky's the limit imagine about it said six months ago they'll bring Ebola
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:19.560]  into the country as we speak the borders wide open
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:25.240]  as we speak anybody can get on a plane from Liberia or Sierra Leone or Guiana
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:30.840]  or wherever and just fly in here with Ebola
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:36.200]  i mean i am three and a half hours from Dallas

[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:42.040]  country
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:47.880]  folks if it killed 10 of people i'd be
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.640]  concerned about it it kills 70
[02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:56.360]  one of my kids gets this there's a 70% chance they're gonna die
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.800]  all because the filthy cdc all because our government
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:07.000]  wants open borders they are so evil they would fund al qaeda to kill 300 plus
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.120]  thousand syrians most of them christians blowing up churches
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:13.880]  chopping their heads off they're not fighting them isis is spreading everywhere

[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:20.840]  bombing any other rebel groups that aren't radical jihadis that came out the
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:24.120]  news yesterday oh there's a lot of friendly fire and i

[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:30.680]  apologize to you i didn't quite believe you when you said
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:36.120]  that ices had chemical weapons but it is fact that ices or al-qaeda they
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:41.000]  they definitely have chemical weapons the major media is now reporting that and
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.440]  what they're saying though is that these weapons were captured
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:49.240]  in small iraqi towns uh yeah they're actually you know we
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:53.080]  know that they were given these weapons from saudi arabia no you
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.120]  and admitted it's exactly it's actually come out that saudi arabia is running
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:27:58.920]  the whole show and has given them the chemical weapons and they launched
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:02.600]  them on a sod three times to blame him i mean imagine
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:05.720]  obama goes if you use chemical weapons which you've never used i will invade
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:08.920]  you and then on the date of his speech a year later
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:13.000]  they launched a chemical attack and blame it on a sod and didn't even care
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.680]  al-qaeda is so uncontrolled see it's like putting black widows in somebody's
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:19.320]  bed they don't run them they turn them loose
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:23.720]  they shot video of themselves launching the chemical attacks
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:27.880]  and did their little video to show off to each other
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:31.480]  so i'm sorry to interrupt you it's just that that's how jerome coursey at world

[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:48.360]  watch a sports center and as the women watch their sitcoms
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:53.800]  i feel the global is prepared for the mass culling
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:56.600]  i think this is probably a big test where they're just going to see if we'll
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:59.080]  stand down when they bring a bowl in and spread it
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:01.880]  then put vaccines in us that the vaccine's probably what we really got to
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:04.680]  look out for and the national institutes of health is now
[02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:06.760]  saying we should all be forced to take the new
[02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:10.280]  millen melinda gates uh foundation notice i talk about bill gates and how
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:13.480]  he's a eugenicist all the time and make films about it and
[02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:17.000]  he gets up and gives speeches about reducing human population down to zero
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.640]  and stuff and then everybody laughs at ted tv
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:23.160]  they're not playing games it's all hidden in plain view and i just sit here
[02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:26.920]  going does anybody care does anybody want to listen to me does anybody
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:31.320]  and i used to harp on the government trying to train the military to attack
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:34.600]  us but that backfired on them because the military is awake now
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:37.000]  i used to harp all day on the militarization of police and all the
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.240]  preparations but that's starting to backfire they can show bad cops all
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:44.760]  day on tv to create a divide and conquer but
[02:34:44.760 --> 02:34:47.880]  it's just a fact's why i talk about it i didn't get this till about six seven
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:50.440]  years ago that the police are now more awake than
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:55.720]  the public the public they just
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:01.160]  we can only reach the general dumb down public we can only get to our eyes
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:05.480]  this country is under attack ladies and gentlemen the whole world is under attack
[02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:08.120]  two things i want to announce and then we're going to go back to your phone
[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:12.200]  calls and some breaking news in this mccain video
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:15.720]  we've had a newsletter that goes out periodically with breaking news
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:19.080]  and and we have people that are writing at seven in the morning nine in the
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:23.160]  morning noon two three and a lot of stuff breaks
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:26.360]  at four or five six o'clock that's the most important news of the day
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:30.360]  and some people turn into the nightly news but it just kind of fades off
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:33.720]  we need to be able to internet censorship and and and facebook and
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:36.520]  twitter not letting us send certain tweets and
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:40.520]  images and documents out the way to reach you
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:46.680]  that's that's digital but also low tech so we can send exclusive videos exclusive
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:50.360]  breaking news so i can send you like our own tweet
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:53.640]  that's what that's what you're tweeting is just a public email

[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:08.760]  that's part of your subscription and i've never done one of the few places
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:12.280]  where light years behind everybody else is having
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:15.880]  free newsletters and promoting and getting people to give us their email so

[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:26.680]  so we can't be censored as easy because it's really getting bad
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:31.080]  where as things get tightened down we have a way to communicate with you
[02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:35.160]  if they shut us off i can still from a terminal send you a message or a video

[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:07.880]  effect so ty who is really helping this spread
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.720]  into it so they get the political blame and don't get the power grab
[02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:16.680]  out of the whole situation and then finally
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:19.960]  if i was you i would be bolstering my body's natural defenses i would be
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:24.680]  trying to eat organic get sunlight vitamin d vitamin b12
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:27.240]  i think i'm gonna even go out and get a prescription and start injecting vitamin
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:30.520]  b12 because the studies i've seen for immune system it's like
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.760]  and i got to take my kids into the doctors see when i get that done or
[02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:35.560]  something because i mean i just this winner is going to be hell
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:38.360]  i've never been a hypochondriac folks told us much of my family started getting
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:42.120]  killed by all these superbugs and stuff i mean this is this it's bad i've
[02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:45.320]  talked to medical doctors i've talked to them on air off air you've talked to
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:48.280]  them i'm taking colloidal silver every day i
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:51.320]  didn't used to do that the silver bullet i'm taking
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:54.040]  supermail vitality to get my glands working
[02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:58.600]  dna force with the coq 10 the bio ppq all the rest of it for
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:01.720]  i mean this just makes vitamin c look like child's play

[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:09.000]  system all available exclusively at info wars

[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:20.200]  of the lung cleanse and all the rest of it is what's making the entire transmission
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:23.640]  possible and i'll tell you right now at the rate we're
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:26.200]  been selling the info wars life dot com products
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:28.840]  we will probably sell out of most of these products and then because of the way
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:32.280]  capital works it'll take months to get the money and then
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:35.720]  read you know reinvest it and and get more produced
[02:41:35.720 --> 02:41:39.480]  because we only use the highest quality organic products and so
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:43.480]  it just takes a time to get the materials we want to be the very best
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:47.880]  win-win-win-win-win for good repurchase so karma whatever you want to call it
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:51.640]  and so we want to have people know that our line of products is the very best
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:55.880]  um we've become so neurotic about not cutting corners that it's almost hard
[02:41:55.880 --> 02:41:58.600]  even bring the products i've even had but haven't meetings about some of our
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.600]  less expensive lines that look do we have to buy the most
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:05.960]  expensive super organic you know totally perfect
[02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:10.040]  no parts per billion of anything when we then just can't even get it most of the
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:13.400]  time and then no one can then we can't even have it
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:17.800]  can't we just be the best out there not the most neurotic perfect
[02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:21.160]  i mean i'm just being honest with you i mean we really do put out the the highest
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:23.800]  quality stuff we do really jump through all the hoops
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:26.920]  because when we know we're a target of the fda we know we're a target of all the
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:30.120]  stalkers and haters and you know people out there
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:33.880]  and so we just go at the very highest platinum standard
[02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:37.640]  at the very best price info wars life dot com
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:41.640]  separately support our local a mnf m affiliates we got a lot of new affiliates
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.320]  a lot of old affiliates become a sponsor spread the word about them thank
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.160]  their sponsors uh give them a donation whatever
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:52.680]  so many stations pick us up on the weekend then they put us on weeknights
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:55.960]  then we're online that's the pattern with almost every station and then they
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:58.920]  sell a few years later that's the other part of the pattern
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:02.920]  and what's espn i don't have a problem with people being obsessed with sports i
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:05.960]  used to be a sports head i used to play sports you name it soccer or
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:10.280]  football baseball softball i mean i'd be out at midnight playing
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:13.800]  baseball or out playing golf in the dark with glowing
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:17.000]  golf balls when i was a teenager i mean you know
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.640]  then afterwards i go knock on the girlfriend's window but uh you know
[02:43:21.640 --> 02:43:25.720]  the point is is that it's your all those energies of sports are meant to be put
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:29.720]  into business and life and family to win there in the ball game was something
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:32.120]  you did on a sunday or saturday or friday night
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.200]  and it wasn't your god it's then it's healthy but it's unhealthy now
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:40.680]  and it's unhealthy that we've been most the stations we've been kicked off of
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:44.680]  we didn't get kicked off of because a lack of money or ratings
[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:48.840]  we made a money we had the ratings most the stations
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:52.200]  that that we have been on for four or five like we were on in
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:55.640]  corpus christi took the station from no ratings to the top rated show
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:59.080]  period in the city for a year a straight year same thing happened in
[02:43:59.080 --> 02:44:03.240]  orlando espn came along with a contract and money
[02:44:03.240 --> 02:44:06.840]  and it wasn't about ratings it was just that just i mean i've been taken off
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:13.640]  over a hundred stations by espn imagine the subjects we're covering here
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:18.200]  and instead it's men making jokes talking about other men all day and what's
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:22.280]  going to happen in a game while abola is spreading
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:27.480]  hey how's abola going to affect the bottom line of your stupid football games
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:33.240]  you know i gave up frisbee golf and and everything a long time ago folks
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:37.080]  because i don't have time to play games anymore
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:40.840]  you understand that and all i'm saying is men don't even know how to fight back
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:46.120]  or speak up because they've never done it try turning the espn off
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:50.040]  let's go to susie in florida go ahead susie

[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:01.640]  and i've listened to you since 2005 and looked up everything
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:05.800]  and i think that you're a human deluxe and you're the only one i trust
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:09.240]  and you taught me a lot of history and after that
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:14.840]  okay um i'm a little bit nervous because i'm don't be nervous sweetie go
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:17.880]  ahead and i pray for you and your family almost
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:21.560]  every day because why are they picking on texas
[02:45:21.560 --> 02:45:25.960]  it's like the borders are down we don't know what's coming across there
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:30.280]  that hospital they're bringing you know the everything seems to be going down
[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:33.400]  there and it's like a coincidence that it's a red
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:38.520]  state or whatever and you know they had the israel
[02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:42.040]  flight stop remember that they stopped it
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:45.240]  completely and yeah well southern england started
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:48.760]  france so did saudi arabia anyone who doesn't want abola
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:52.680]  shut flights down from abola countries it's a no brainer that people that have
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:55.560]  abola are going to get on airplanes to go to the west
[02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:59.640]  and listen here it hasn't even started yet as africa begins to accelerate
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:04.680]  exponentially with abola where do you think they're going to go
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:09.160]  i mean it it looks like what it has been looking like
[02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:15.160]  and i mean they hate america they're they're no ben franklin that's for sure
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:20.120]  and i mean i mean the israel flights when gaza was fighting them
[02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:25.720]  and they were trying to blame israel for them hiding their weapons in school
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:28.600]  houses i know i don't stop that quick and i mean
[02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:33.720]  that's my issue is everybody lionizes any you know hamas
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.120]  and hamas drags non radical muslims to the streets behind motorbikes and i'm
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:41.480]  not defending stuff israel does either but it doesn't mean that i then jump in
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:45.880]  bed with with with the un's cause celeb the
[02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:48.760]  pal the the radical element of the palestinians
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:53.160]  it's all a mess it's just a total mess i want to play this john mccain report
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:59.160]  then we'll go to john james nancy and matt and others but this report is going
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:02.040]  to premiere on the nightly news tonight well now it's going to premiere here
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:05.880]  a listener sent us this video yesterday so good job they shot the video it's
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:10.280]  the knowland report dot com shot by david of the knowland report dot com
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:13.960]  the video starts with colonel schaefer talking about how ben gazi has a
[02:47:13.960 --> 02:47:16.680]  missile deal to arm syrian rebels via turkey
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:20.440]  then it cuts to mccain after a public appearance he's asked about how
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:23.960]  we know the arms we are giving the rebels will not fall into the wrong hands he
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:27.720]  has then asked directly about the missile deal out of ben gazi and he says
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:30.760]  that yeah the sun rises out of the west and pigs
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.200]  flying remember they said to al gore that not every scientist
[02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:37.800]  agrees that man made global warming is happening he said and the moon landings
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:41.560]  didn't happen in real polls the majority of scientists say
[02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:44.760]  man made global warming is a fraud it's the sun
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  but see they can make a moon landing joke the video then cuts to wane madden
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:54.040]  talking about mccain's past so again here is
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:59.160]  this new video of mccain being confronted sandwiched with the true skinny on
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:02.520]  what's happening well first off there's a realization
[02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:05.640]  now like you can probably figure all of our options for syria
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:09.960]  are bad i mean i don't want to get the details of the trouble but
[02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:13.880]  there's people been fired over telling the truth of the white house saying look
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:17.720]  these are the options we have and they're all
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:20.280]  bad and by the way getting involved directly it's just
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.880]  going to make things worse you know so the whole idea of
[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:27.000]  arming these folks and let's be honest here there's clear evidence of my
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.880]  judgment that the the libya consulate that was
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:33.560]  attacked on the 9 11 anniversary was very much involved in moving you know
[02:48:33.560 --> 02:48:36.200]  obtaining surface air missiles and other arms
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:40.200]  militians and transferring it via the turks to the rebels in syria
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.560]  i just don't think it's in our interest to be doing that sort of thing based on
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:46.120]  the fact that you mentioned all of the chances are pretty good
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:48.360]  this all could come back and fight us someday
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:52.760]  how do we know that the arms that are going to the syrian rebels are not
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:56.760]  going to get into the hands of ices because if we had people who
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:00.600]  could were there to funnel it to the right people and i know these people and
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:03.560]  i know who they are and i know how to do it and so do other people
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:07.000]  it's this administration that doesn't want to do it that is sending them to
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:10.200]  certain death when they're training them and not
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:13.480]  preventing basher Assad from barrel bombing them
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:17.800]  it's disgraceful you have any more you have any comments about the arms deal
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:21.560]  from Benghazi getting into the hands of the syrian office
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:26.040]  that didn't happen the 15,000 stinger missiles no it didn't happen
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:29.080]  it didn't happen it didn't happen why would you think such a thing
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:31.720]  somebody's really not informing you well
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:35.800]  talk talk talk only talk only of the cia said that
[02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:39.720]  the 15,000 stinger missiles got into the hands of the syrian
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:43.400]  yes and he also had pig flies and pigs fly and
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:47.400]  and the sun comes up in the west sure on on blackmail oh
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:51.880]  yes absolutely you mentioned mccain and what do they got on this guy i mean
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:55.480]  obviously he's blackmail three ways from sunday
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:59.560]  they know he was saying like a canary to his north vietnamese captors
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:03.560]  for six months he he was giving operational schedules for
[02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:09.160]  us uh of flights uh attack flights into north vietnam
[02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:14.680]  he also was responsible for the terrible fire on us as far as tall that killed
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:20.840]  um you know over 200 uh naval personnel and he was the first guy taken off
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:24.680]  because they knew he was responsible because of his hot shot antics
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:29.080]  they call him johnny west star because he would uh flame is uh
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.240]  engine out as a form of hazing
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:37.560]  that's innocent whistleblower wane madson so there you go ladies and gentlemen

[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:19.320]  suffer through an asthmatic breathing type situation
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:22.920]  my breathing is shallow and generally constricted in the nose and lungs
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:26.840]  after consuming one world weight today I have tremendous energy and also notice
[02:53:26.840 --> 02:53:30.040]  my breathing is free I can feel the air in my left
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:32.840]  nostril and it is free all the way to my abdomen
[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:36.760]  which is pretty remarkable because I rarely get that feeling being a singer I

[02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:14.600]  host Alex Jones our story that Paul Watson just put up the last
[02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:17.960]  30 minutes is now linked on the left hand column of a
[02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:24.360]  Bola coverage at drudgerport.com and that is dealing with riots in
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:35.400]  Sierra Leone dealing with Ebola and it is the social cost of this
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:39.560]  that is really big it is the panic that's the real crisis police resort to tear
[02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:41.480]  gas after body of a Bola victim left in
[02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:44.840]  street for two days they're locking people up in giant
[02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:49.640]  Ebola ghettos starving not letting them out but hey there's one way to get out
[02:54:49.640 --> 02:54:53.560]  that's on a u.s. bound aircraft I shouldn't laugh
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:58.120]  I mean I'm right here in Texas right by the epicenter
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:04.200]  and man this is going to just devastate healthcare more in this country
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:09.800]  unbelievable John in Wisconsin you're on the air go ahead
[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:13.400]  yeah Alex how you doing haven't been on a while I've been kind of under the
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:16.760]  weather but I'm back now you're calling in so what do you
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:20.280]  think about the situation well I got two statements about the
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:23.080]  situation and I got an analogy for you at the end
[02:55:23.080 --> 02:55:27.400]  first of all I read an article I've been following the
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:33.560]  mbuntu movement in South Africa and they said that there were millions of
[02:55:33.560 --> 02:55:38.520]  bottles of colloidal silver that were purchased
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:42.760]  and shipped to Africa no I know I've seen the letter in the news articles in
[02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:46.040]  Africa where they were saying it was helping and there's an army study and
[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:48.840]  and the government will just freak out and come after anybody that that
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:52.760]  actually covers that study so I want to agree with the FDA colloidal silver is
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:56.280]  horrible even though I take it and it's just it's just it's just the
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:01.960]  government loves you and Obama loves you well it is the way it was stated
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:05.480]  it's not like somebody in the government or somewhere
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:09.400]  refused to shipment it cost them almost five million dollars to ship the
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:12.600]  yeah I know it was it was turned around but but they had there's also previous
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:16.760]  reports of people saying it was helpful I mean that's really a no-brainer I'm
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:19.960]  not saying it's a cure I'm not I don't think anything's a cure all of something
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:22.680]  but undoubtedly other antibiotics are helping as well
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:26.760]  will silvers a natural antibiotic it's just not patented so the big companies
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:29.640]  can't make money so they have the government go after
[02:56:29.640 --> 02:56:32.440]  anybody that you know that tries to promote it and put it out there
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:38.280]  all I know is I had three family members die from mutated bacteria this year
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:42.440]  I got it while at the hospital with my uncle and literally was coughing up
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:44.600]  blood for two months it could barely be on air
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.800]  it's a month and a half my dad had it for two months and I drank two bottles of
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.240]  colloidal silver in one week and it finally knocked it out so
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:55.720]  it worked for me that's all I can say thank god for it now
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:57:00.920]  I literally have an entire cabinet not just full of silver bullet but other
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:03.880]  brands because I believe ours is really good but I
[02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:07.160]  don't even you know I don't know it varies person to person
[02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:11.640]  I've got hundreds of bottles you can go to my house open the cabinet
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:15.560]  and there's like 200 bottles okay because I gotta be able to take care of
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:18.360]  myself and other people and I think I'm gonna get even more
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:22.840]  by the way we're sold out of it I'm not even promoting it but yes I'm aware of
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:25.800]  all that and government's been buying it but
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:29.000]  they just don't want you to have it that's just it's unbelievable
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.360]  and I'm not saying vitamin C is a cure all but it certainly in study shows it
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:35.080]  boosts your immune system but they won't tell anybody that stuff
[02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:37.880]  what's your analogy John I gotta get to other people
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:42.760]  well the analogy is uh I don't know if you I don't know if you remember
[02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:48.840]  back in the 60s or 70s if you've ever seen any old shows of like um
[02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:52.600]  uh the itself in a show there was a gentleman on there was a ventriloquist
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:58.760]  his name was senior wences yes and he had this doll that he he painted a face
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:03.640]  and looks on his hand and put a wig on it and that was Johnny
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:07.640]  well the analogy is that the senior wences is the globalist
[02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:12.360]  johnny is obama and a democrat everything that comes out of a democrat's
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:14.840]  mouth is what the globalist wants you to know
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:17.880]  that's right and the republicans just say enough good stuff
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:21.560]  to fool you but they're the other arm of the puppet master as well
[02:58:21.560 --> 02:58:25.080]  so the tea party tried to take that over so they're under attack the republican
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:28.600]  and democratic leadership are giving more money to defeat tea party candidates
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:31.960]  than to defeat each other that's even in uh politica
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:36.200]  because they know folks that the tea party is enough common sense to bring
[02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:38.840]  them down a little bit of overdrive coming up to go to
[02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:43.720]  james and matt you are listening and nancy and i'll try to go to paul but
[02:58:43.720 --> 02:58:47.160]  each person just be ready live dot com today all right we'll be back stay with
[02:58:47.160 --> 02:58:50.040]  us

[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:29.480]  little bit of love obama transmission let's go to james in

[03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:44.920]  but not these are frustrating times so these are three points that i have you
[03:00:44.920 --> 03:00:48.360]  know they're very frustrating points one i'm looking at the global disease
[03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:51.640]  outbreak map a couple days ago they had all the
[03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:55.960]  indicators for where it was happening where the alerts were coming from
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:00.360]  different flagship symbols but you know today i go on it and
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:04.680]  there's nothing there's nothing there and there's no outbreak reports coming
[03:01:04.680 --> 03:01:09.320]  out of mexico very peculiar i'm looking for hazmat suits aj
[03:01:09.320 --> 03:01:13.000]  class a suits level four thousand bucks or more
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:18.920]  it's out of my range class b suits a hundred bucks class c 50 i was
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:22.440]  hoping that these uh manufacturers can be better than that
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:27.240]  uh one other final thing here is i was trying to get in touch with this nurse
[03:01:27.240 --> 03:01:33.400]  kelly sites s i t e s she's out of eco michigan and she had come back from
[03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:36.760]  libaria with a couple of the other doctors that
[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:40.760]  contracted the people of iris she did not contract that
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:44.280]  she did isolate herself for 21 days before returning back to her
[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:48.920]  family i could not get in touch with her her number has been disconnected
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:53.080]  her husband charles has been is not well we gotta check into these stories i
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:56.200]  agree everybody's been doing that on the ground gotta jump thank you good points
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:01.080]  nancy in michigan go ahead hi alex i just wanted to say that something
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:06.680]  suspicious is going on with this uh medicaid obama care thing i get free
[03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:11.400]  rides from meridian they contract drivers
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:16.520]  and i'm able to get my own driver but they reimburse you for 41 cents a mile
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:20.200]  for gas but their contractors it seems like the
[03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:23.400]  last four drivers i had were from west africa
[03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:27.240]  they could barely speak english they were driving lexuses and
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:30.760]  and um electric cars and that sort of thing they were on the phone the whole
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:34.120]  time and they actually looking at their phone while they're driving
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:38.440]  we were swerving into other lanes well here's the deal the country free legals
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:43.000]  is literally wide open that's why they dare not stop the obola flights because
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.920]  we're just totally wide open and the answer is do it illegally as long as
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:49.720]  you do it illegally you're going to be giving everything free you try to
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:53.240]  become a citizen naturally properly you'll be destroyed
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:58.200]  uh i hear your points i mean it just and as africa implodes
[03:02:58.200 --> 03:03:02.600]  it will be emptied out in the u.s now known as the old is the obola toilet
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.760]  the obola toilet uh thank you nancy uh everyone should beg to be the obama
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:14.200]  toilet or your racist uh mat in texas you're on the air go ahead
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:17.960]  hi alex good to talk to you longtime listener first-time caller i guess i
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:22.040]  could say i'm reporting to you uh right here in the epicenter we've got uh
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:26.040]  texas presby as well as mr duncans apartment so you're calling from the
[03:03:26.040 --> 03:03:32.120]  epicenter of the obola toilet in dallas correct well tell us about it
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:36.600]  yeah uh the apartment complex uh... the mr duncan lived in is about six blocks
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:39.880]  north of us as well the first infected nurse
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:42.680]  uh... lives about four blocks south of us
[03:03:42.680 --> 03:03:46.360]  uh... i can only guess that the second infected nurse that came up
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:50.120]  recently uh lives in the immediate area because the news helicopters have been
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:53.000]  buzzing around gathering their feeds and their footage
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:56.600]  uh pretty much since about six thirty central time this morning
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:04:00.360]  uh it's a very unique experience you know my uh my girlfriend and i typically
[03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:03.320]  go out and do our grocery shopping every saturday
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:07.800]  and uh i don't think we're going to be doing that this saturday at least not
[03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:10.040]  here uh we're probably going to go about an hour
[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:13.640]  outside of town to do this and uh you know that's smart because you're right
[03:04:13.640 --> 03:04:17.160]  at the epicenter of it you're where a lot of us are going to be in a week or
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:20.680]  two uh as this probably starts to spread
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:24.280]  and just do you want to thank obama for letting the foreigners in and do you
[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:26.840]  want to thank him for leaving the borders open
[03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:31.240]  uh wouldn't really say thank him that's because you're racist
[03:04:31.240 --> 03:04:35.400]  yeah i won't say that on the air but uh anyway uh i've
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:39.080]  you know i probably wouldn't be so on edge if i actually thought for a second
[03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:43.240]  these local servants and uh quote cdc officials actually knew what they were
[03:04:43.240 --> 03:04:46.600]  handling or what they were up against but i don't think they do
[03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:50.120]  and uh it's it's no i hear you well listen keep calling us keep us updated
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:53.240]  sorry to other callers out of time nightly news tonight seven o'clock
