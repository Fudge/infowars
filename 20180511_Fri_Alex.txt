[00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:26.203]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.203 --> 00:00:27.284]  This is real?
[00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:29.563]  This is not fiction.
[00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:32.286]  This is our enemies showing themselves.
[00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:43.956]  Maxine Waters, triggered, explodes on the House floor, takes back her time, will not let someone speak, saying, I resent making America great again.
[00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:46.759]  Here is the revealing footage.
[00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:51.767]  We are trying to make sure that we're making America great every day in every way.
[00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:56.630]  And the best way to do that is to stop talking about discrimination and start talking about the nation.
[00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.751]  We're coming together as a people in spite of what you say.
[00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:00.372]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:00.852]  I yield back.
[00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.280]  Gentleman's time has expired.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.840]  Members are reminded to address their remarks to the chair.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.141]  The gentleman from Texas Reserves, gentlelady from California.
[00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:10.782]  Thank you very much.
[00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:21.084]  The gentleman, Mr. Kelly, please do not leave because I want you to know that I am more offended as an African-American woman than you will ever be.
[00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:27.006]  And this business about making America great again, it is your president that's dividing this country.
[00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:30.327]  And don't talk to me about the fact that we don't understand
[00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:31.628]  Well the gentlelady will suspend.
[00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:32.428]  The gentlelady will suspend.
[00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:35.770]  The chair wishes to remind all members that they are to address their remarks to the chair.
[00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:53.298]  I respect the chair, but don't stop me in the middle when you didn't stop him in the middle.
[00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:55.259]  And so I shall continue.
[00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:03.943]  Don't you dare talk to me like that and think that somehow women don't understand what goes on on the floor of automobile dealers.
[00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:05.643]  And I am saying that I will continue.
[00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:09.905]  I think?
[00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:38.290]  I reserved the balance of my time and no, I do not yield not one second to you.
[00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.710]  Not one second.
[00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.632]  Not one second to you.
[00:02:42.632 --> 00:02:46.193]  That woman is worth reportedly 50 plus million dollars.
[00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:48.134]  She went to Congress with no money.
[00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:54.037]  She's given massive direct cash payments to her husband's bank that he chaired.
[00:02:57.492 --> 00:03:07.774]  She lives in multiple mansions, drives the finest cars, wears the finest clothes, and bitches and gripes and hates this country.
[00:03:07.774 --> 00:03:15.875]  We're trying to actually turn the economy back on, bring people together, and she's up there talking about men harassing women on car dealership floors.
[00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:25.917]  When the borders are collapsing, billions of people are close to starvation, the world's in a critical crisis, and the globalists are on record trying to make us fight with each other any way
[00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:27.846]  We can.
[00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:40.655]  You know, there's a famous congressional report back in the late 50s on the goals of communism from captured FSB and previously KGB documents.
[00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:51.402]  And in there, it talks about making men and women fight with each other, making families fight, getting rid of Christianity, and then replacing it with a godless state so that people have nothing.
[00:03:51.402 --> 00:03:52.923]  They stand for nothing.
[00:03:52.923 --> 00:03:53.584]  And you heard her.
[00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:56.466]  I resent your make America great again comments.
[00:03:57.711 --> 00:04:01.694]  And this dishonorable president.
[00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:14.103]  And notice Trump is just delivering on every single front.
[00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:22.069]  I'm going to go over the current communist goals later in the broadcast directly from whitehouse.gov because
[00:04:24.212 --> 00:04:26.174]  That is in the congressional record.
[00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:29.536]  And then I want to ask you, has it not happened?
[00:04:29.536 --> 00:04:33.399]  When you think communist goals, it's globalist goals.
[00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:34.480]  Who funded communism?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.121]  The richest people in the world.
[00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:37.843]  To con the serfs.
[00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:39.804]  All the world, slavery was ending.
[00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:41.225]  Land servitude was ending.
[00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:46.529]  So they had to con you, as the cities became industrialized, back into a form of communism.
[00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.831]  Back into a form of the communal.
[00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.813]  Or living in the communal on the land.
[00:04:50.813 --> 00:04:52.474]  That the Lord is above you in the castle.
[00:04:52.474 --> 00:04:53.415]  You're in a communal.
[00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.619]  But they're not.
[00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:00.584]  It's called slavery.

[00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:24.483]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:32.469]  Ladies and gentlemen, Maxine Waters is a mad dog.
[00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.190]  She is like Cujo.
[00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.873]  She has cultural, political, spiritual rabies.
[00:06:38.823 --> 00:06:44.666]  I don't know which dog bit the other dog, but Hillary's got the same disease, megalomania.
[00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:48.167]  Everything in their wake is death and destruction.
[00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:58.852]  And we're going to be breaking down this incredible speech where she said, quote, I resent Make America Great Again.
[00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:07.456]  We'll play the full remarks coming up, but I want to play just the end part here in a moment, where she says, I resent Make America Great Again, and I resent
[00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:18.545]  This president, and the hatred, the vitriol, the anger, and the way she's talking about women and blacks, like it's a title.
[00:07:18.545 --> 00:07:20.385]  Like, I am oppressed.
[00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:21.925]  I have a title.
[00:07:21.925 --> 00:07:26.906]  Like, I'm a king, I'm an earl, I'm a queen, I'm a duke, I am a woman.
[00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:28.067]  You have wronged me.
[00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:29.967]  I have resentment for all of you.
[00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:35.308]  I have chips on my shoulder, and I'm black, and you've done something to me.
[00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:43.430]  And people are sick of it because we know it's weaponized to keep people in a cultural plantation.
[00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.531]  That doesn't mean there aren't racists on all sides.
[00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.312]  Doesn't mean there's all sorts of bad things in the world.
[00:07:47.312 --> 00:07:49.034]  There's also a lot of good in the world.
[00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:51.795]  And Trump is really trying to build factories in Detroit.
[00:07:51.795 --> 00:07:54.157]  How about affirmative action?
[00:07:54.157 --> 00:08:00.982]  He is building and getting companies to build hundreds of new factories in predominantly black areas.
[00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:02.003]  And incentivizing
[00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:12.101]  Major government loans to not sit there and just give somebody affirmative action, put them at the head of the line, ahead of even Asians.
[00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:16.242]  Women and blacks and Hispanics ahead of Asians.
[00:08:16.242 --> 00:08:20.843]  Because they don't deserve it, because you know, all the top slots the Asians are basically getting.
[00:08:20.843 --> 00:08:21.904]  See how that works?
[00:08:21.904 --> 00:08:24.664]  Penalizing people that actually work hard?
[00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:30.826]  Trump's actually deploying billions and billions and billions of dollars of scholarships to minorities.
[00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:37.223]  That's being radically expanded, and the Democrats cannot stand it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:37.223 --> 00:08:46.610]  They are pulling their hair out as the factories come back, as the jobs come back, and as we try to unify the nation.
[00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.854]  That's right, Fiat Chrysler moving some production back from Mexico due to pressure from Trump.
[00:08:51.854 --> 00:08:52.774]  That's USA Today.
[00:08:52.774 --> 00:09:00.460]  There are hundreds of big factories that have already come back, hundreds more coming back, thousands of little ones that have already come back.
[00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:09.293]  That's right, Trump signed the executive order on black colleges.
[00:09:09.293 --> 00:09:16.619]  $25 billion for infrastructure, college readiness, financial aid, and other priorities.
[00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:19.641]  Shingling blacks out particularly.
[00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:20.942]  Obama never did that.
[00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:24.964]  Remember black leaders in Chicago going, man he didn't even come visit us.
[00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.585]  He didn't even care about us.
[00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:30.607]  Well that's because you've got the image of a black guy and that's all you need.
[00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:36.930]  Instead of the reality of an actual good paying 50, 60, 70, 80 thousand dollar a year job.
[00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.972]  Would you rather have that or live in the projects and mama can't have daddy at home or she doesn't get the check?
[00:09:41.972 --> 00:09:44.654]  You know he wrote a bunch of letters there in the Library of Congress.
[00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:47.075]  His name was Lyndon Baines Johnson, a KKK member.
[00:09:48.274 --> 00:09:53.375]  And he said, I'll have those N-words voting Democrat for a hundred years.
[00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:57.816]  We're going to get those daddies out of the house and we're going to pay off their mamas.
[00:09:57.816 --> 00:09:59.657]  And they're going to be under our control.
[00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:07.018]  And within just 20 years, black illegitimacy went from 10, 15% to over 80.
[00:10:07.018 --> 00:10:08.578]  Just like that.
[00:10:08.578 --> 00:10:12.959]  And any other culture or group that gets on the welfare, it's over!
[00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.240]  It's over!
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:14.940]  It's over!
[00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:19.908]  And they know exactly what they did.
[00:10:19.908 --> 00:10:28.874]  And Maxine Waters is a monstrous, monstrous, monstrous person.
[00:10:28.874 --> 00:10:30.455]  Look at CBS spending it.
[00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:36.979]  Lyndon Johnson was a civil rights hero, but he was also a racist.
[00:10:36.979 --> 00:10:37.800]  He was a hero.
[00:10:41.084 --> 00:10:47.749]  You know, until the 1950s, blacks had lower illegitimacy than whites in this country.
[00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:50.852]  And they always spin it like, oh, you're attacking women that don't have a man at home.
[00:10:50.852 --> 00:10:51.692]  Nobody's doing that.
[00:10:51.692 --> 00:10:55.696]  There are a lot of single mothers that are heroes, the real heroes.
[00:10:55.696 --> 00:11:04.923]  But the system's been set up to make you dependent, to make everybody dependent.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.342]  Just search engine Lyndon Baines Johnson's comments about black people.
[00:11:11.342 --> 00:11:14.023]  They've got the actual letters.
[00:11:14.023 --> 00:11:18.185]  I'll have those GDN words voting Democrat for a hundred years.
[00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:19.766]  There's even recordings of it.
[00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:21.146]  I played them years ago.
[00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:23.607]  YouTube took them down once when I put them out saying they were racist.
[00:11:23.607 --> 00:11:25.888]  You can't report on a racist because see, then you're racist.
[00:11:25.888 --> 00:11:29.250]  But if somebody's one of the low-level racists they want you to know about, they'll leave it up.
[00:11:30.063 --> 00:11:33.004]  And he's sitting there on the tapes at the White House talking.
[00:11:33.004 --> 00:11:37.585]  He's going, I tell you, he's... I won't even say it because the media will edit it together and then say I said it.
[00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.485]  But he's saying there's these uppity people.
[00:11:39.485 --> 00:11:40.925]  We're going to get them.
[00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:41.865]  We're going to shut them down.
[00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:46.206]  We're going to bypass these Republicans who got the Civil Rights Act passed.
[00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:50.527]  And the Democrats, the Dixiecrats, did not know what to do.
[00:11:50.527 --> 00:11:54.248]  So the social engineers came up with a plan and it worked great.
[00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:54.668]  And now
[00:11:56.038 --> 00:12:01.202]  Here we are, 50, 60 years later, and Maxine Waters has been in Congress for 30 years.
[00:12:01.202 --> 00:12:03.203]  She went in there with nothing.
[00:12:03.203 --> 00:12:07.006]  She's worth reportedly $50 million, her husband even more.
[00:12:07.006 --> 00:12:08.467]  Some numbers are $30 to $80 million.
[00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:12.630]  The numbers vary on her, $30 to $50.
[00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:12.810]  She gave...
[00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:27.214]  Tens of millions of dollars over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again to her husband's bank!
[00:12:27.214 --> 00:12:28.074]  Look it up!
[00:12:28.074 --> 00:12:30.255]  Nobody's gotten away with what she's gotten away with!
[00:12:32.162 --> 00:12:34.724]  Because she is so arrogant and so hateful.
[00:12:34.724 --> 00:12:40.689]  And here's the video, full video's coming up, where she says she resents Make America Great Again.
[00:12:40.689 --> 00:12:42.091]  Here it is.
[00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:46.314]  I'm saying that I will continue to do that.
[00:12:46.314 --> 00:12:56.984]  However, I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him when he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more about discrimination than I know about discrimination.
[00:12:57.504 --> 00:13:01.966]  I resent that, and I resent the remark about making America great again.
[00:13:01.966 --> 00:13:07.008]  He's down here making a speech for this dishonorable President of the United States of America.
[00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:13.571]  Having said that, I reserve the balance of my time, and no, I do not yield not one second to you.
[00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:14.912]  Not one second.
[00:13:14.912 --> 00:13:16.852]  Not one second to you.
[00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:20.534]  You know, if Maxine Mad Dog Waters
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:29.123]  Had ever been through the stuff I've been through at the hands of white people, then I could expect some of that hate.
[00:13:29.123 --> 00:13:29.744]  But you know what?
[00:13:29.744 --> 00:13:33.766]  She doesn't have one story about a white person physically attacking her or anything.
[00:13:33.766 --> 00:13:36.087]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas.
[00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:39.809]  And I have experienced gangs of racist black people.
[00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:42.931]  But see, I'm not an idiot, so I don't hate all black people, and most black folks aren't like that.
[00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:48.075]  But growing up in Dallas, Texas, there were a lot of really racist black people.
[00:13:48.075 --> 00:14:00.009]  In fact, if I had buddies that played football that were black or whatever, and sometimes I'd be out with them, you know, going, walking to somebody's house or something, or going to play baseball, and car pull up, bunch of big black guys get out and say, what the hell are you doing with this cracker?
[00:14:00.009 --> 00:14:01.031]  We're gonna beat your ass too.
[00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:04.290]  Maxine Waters knows full that.
[00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.812]  She's a raging race pimp.
[00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:08.013]  She hates black people.
[00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:11.355]  She knows how to sucker them and manipulate them and get rich off of them.
[00:14:11.355 --> 00:14:17.179]  She's a dirty monster just like Hillary Clinton and just like Michael Moore and all these folks.
[00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.941]  And they are so pissed that Republicans are trying to bring people together.
[00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:21.843]  The old blue blood Republicans are all dying off.
[00:14:22.868 --> 00:14:25.890]  Donald Trump opened up all his golf courses to black people and Jews.
[00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.753]  They all know that's why he was such a big hero to the hip-hop groups.
[00:14:28.753 --> 00:14:30.994]  That's why they're all crapping their drawers.
[00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:39.260]  Because somebody's coming around that isn't there to screw everybody over, you witch, you nasty, evil, dirty, globalist piece of crap.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.482]  Excuse me, I'm getting a little bit angry here.
[00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:45.465]  We're going to go to Brent and come back with all the speech and so much international news.

[00:20:03.346 --> 00:20:06.069]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:19.707 --> 00:20:23.034]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[00:20:23.034 --> 00:20:25.800]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:27.983 --> 00:20:33.125]  And I'm saying that I will continue to do that.
[00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:44.350]  However, I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him when he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more about discrimination than I know about discrimination.
[00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.792]  I resent that, and I resent the remark about making America great again.
[00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:53.534]  He's down here making a speech for this dishonorable President of the United States of America.
[00:20:54.995 --> 00:21:00.399]  I reserve the balance of my time and no, I do not yield not one second to you.
[00:21:00.399 --> 00:21:01.720]  Not one second.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.304]  Not one second to you.
[00:21:06.304 --> 00:21:09.446]  Meanwhile, black people get poorer, more of them are in prison.
[00:21:09.446 --> 00:21:16.371]  Hillary got the laws passed when Bill Clinton was in office to make black people come to heel like a dog because they're quote super predators.
[00:21:16.371 --> 00:21:19.874]  Should I play that video clip of Hillary saying that again?
[00:21:19.874 --> 00:21:20.935]  There she is with Bill Clinton.
[00:21:22.315 --> 00:21:23.555]  She's part of the ruling class.
[00:21:23.555 --> 00:21:34.878]  She is the apprentice, the baby Sith Lord of LBJ, who openly wanted to enslave black people with welfare, and they did a pretty good job of it.
[00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:35.839]  It's sick.
[00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:47.762]  And then she's triggered by a speech we played excerpts of earlier, where he's just talking about making America great again and coming together and not being racist and not pushing the race card all the time.
[00:21:47.762 --> 00:21:51.523]  But that's what the Me Too movement, all of this is about, total division.
[00:21:53.018 --> 00:21:54.759]  And she is so corrupt.
[00:21:54.759 --> 00:21:56.761]  She's listed as one of the most corrupt members of Congress.
[00:21:56.761 --> 00:21:57.502]  She knows it.
[00:21:57.502 --> 00:22:06.169]  She's got this whole stick she's running, a virtue signaling as a smoke screen the incredible crimes that she's committed.
[00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:13.975]  In fact, we ought to take some of her speeches and weave them in with Hillary Clinton saying blacks are animals, that they need to be brought to heel like dogs, all the rest of it.
[00:22:13.975 --> 00:22:18.679]  Because it is unbelievable how long all this has been going on.
[00:22:18.679 --> 00:22:20.080]  It's truly sickening.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.561]  Yeah, there's a...
[00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:30.605]  LBJ, I'll have those N-words voting Democrat for the next 200 years, touting his underlying intentions for the Great Society programs.
[00:22:30.605 --> 00:22:35.729]  LBJ confided with two like-minded governors on Air Force One.
[00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:36.990]  That's the congressional record.
[00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.891]  He also, there's letters with similar things.
[00:22:38.891 --> 00:22:43.154]  He was a dragon, not a grand dragon.
[00:22:43.154 --> 00:22:46.477]  He just ran a major city in South Texas.
[00:22:46.477 --> 00:22:49.199]  He was a dragon in the KKK.
[00:22:52.751 --> 00:22:55.232]  And you see, those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:22:55.232 --> 00:22:58.394]  The Republicans were the abolitionists.
[00:22:58.394 --> 00:23:00.635]  They were the big Christian party.
[00:23:00.635 --> 00:23:02.917]  You know, Lincoln?
[00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:16.404]  And then by the 50s and 60s, people like my grandfather, whose family were all Democrats in East Texas, he'd been in World War II, he said, no, we need to stop treating black people like second-class citizens, third-class citizens.
[00:23:16.404 --> 00:23:19.666]  And so there was a big Republican sweep with Eisenhower in the 50s.
[00:23:21.425 --> 00:23:22.385]  The Democrats didn't know what to do.
[00:23:22.385 --> 00:23:24.846]  The Republicans were passing a Civil Rights Act.
[00:23:24.846 --> 00:23:26.787]  So they came up with a Southern strategy.
[00:23:26.787 --> 00:23:31.729]  They tricked the Republicans into it, the Blue Bloods, by diving in and saying, oh, we love the minorities now.
[00:23:31.729 --> 00:23:36.070]  We're going to give you free stuff, but you've got to go under our control.
[00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.511]  And the Republicans switched back to a Southern strategy.
[00:23:38.511 --> 00:23:41.472]  There were a lot of racist Blue Bloods in there as well.
[00:23:41.472 --> 00:23:45.813]  But here we are today with the rebranding of the Democrats as the guys that care about you.
[00:23:45.813 --> 00:23:47.374]  It's unbelievable.
[00:23:49.392 --> 00:23:55.336]  In fact, here is Hillary Clinton in her Super Predators comment when they were running for president.
[00:23:55.336 --> 00:23:58.298]  And then there's similar comments she made when they were running for re-election in 1995.
[00:23:58.298 --> 00:23:58.599]  Here it is.
[00:24:01.155 --> 00:24:03.236]  Not just gangs of kids anymore.
[00:24:03.236 --> 00:24:07.019]  They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators.
[00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:09.020]  No conscience, no empathy.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.903]  We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.
[00:24:12.903 --> 00:24:19.027]  And the president has asked the FBI to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere.
[00:24:19.027 --> 00:24:22.169]  In addition to that, he has appointed a new drug czar.
[00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:23.790]  You probably saw him Tuesday night.
[00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:27.493]  He's one of the most distinguished active military... Okay, so there you go.
[00:24:27.493 --> 00:24:29.734]  And they made it where blacks are caught with cocaine.
[00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:30.735]  They got three times...
[00:24:32.517 --> 00:24:34.740]  That of a white.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.400]  And how'd they do that?
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:44.452]  Well, they made crack cocaine, even though per volume it had the same amount of cocaine in it.
[00:24:44.452 --> 00:24:49.899]  They would then give you triple the sentence, because it was a drug blacks predominantly used at the time.
[00:24:51.547 --> 00:24:56.329]  Remember, uh, Schlitzmalt liquor, almost exclusively drunk by blacks?
[00:24:56.329 --> 00:25:02.071]  It'd be like saying if the cops catch you with Schlitzmalt liquor, uh, drinking and driving, you get 10 years in prison.
[00:25:02.071 --> 00:25:07.613]  But if they catch you with Kerr's Light, you get probation.
[00:25:07.613 --> 00:25:09.974]  You're like, but it's the same thing.
[00:25:09.974 --> 00:25:16.077]  I mean, you could argue Schlitzmalt liquor might be a little bit stronger, but per ounce of alcohol, it's still the same charge.
[00:25:20.179 --> 00:25:20.920]  Think about that.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.281]  Oh, well, you got to split small liquor.
[00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:24.063]  We're going to put you in jail for 10 years.
[00:25:24.063 --> 00:25:29.127]  Oh, you're drinking Milwaukee's best?
[00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:31.209]  You get probation because that's what whites drink.
[00:25:31.209 --> 00:25:35.994]  By the way, if you're going to drink cheap liquor, I know in high school and college, split small liquor is pretty good, actually.
[00:25:37.697 --> 00:25:38.658]  We're good to go.
[00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:12.739]  Did the Kool-Aid guy rip off Slit-Spot Liquor when he busted the wall, or was it the bull that ripped off the other way around?
[00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:13.319]  Who knows?
[00:26:13.319 --> 00:26:18.684]  I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen, but do blacks deserve triple the time for cocaine that whites do?
[00:26:18.684 --> 00:26:19.165]  No, they don't.
[00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:19.986]  That's racist.
[00:26:19.986 --> 00:26:20.726]  Who did that?
[00:26:20.726 --> 00:26:21.727]  Bill Clinton.
[00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:25.511]  And then who says, oh, they're so concerned about blacks in prison?
[00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:29.575]  Maxine Waters and Bill Clinton and the whole filthy, stinking Democratic Party.
[00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:41.492]  I've now digressed into three full segments on Maxine Waters, and I still have got a ways to go, so I'm going to stop right there because there's so much other big news to hit.
[00:26:41.492 --> 00:26:43.936]  What we need is Christian culture.
[00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:46.959]  Even if we don't believe in God, real Christian culture
[00:26:47.819 --> 00:26:54.583]  Big families, all of that creates low crime, incredible prosperity and happiness all over the world where it's practiced.
[00:26:54.583 --> 00:27:06.770]  You'll have one African tribe that's Christian, and they're super rich and wealthy and successful, and you'll have another African tribe that isn't, the exact same genetics, in places like Rwanda, and they're living in mud huts.
[00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.613]  One tribe 200 years ago adopted Christianity, the other tribe didn't.
[00:27:10.613 --> 00:27:14.075]  One lives in mud huts, one has high-tech factories.
[00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:24.949]  That's what we have with the story by Dan Lyman at EuropeWars.com, our European division.
[00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:26.490]  It's also up on NewsWars.com.
[00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:34.175]  We will build a 21st century Christian democracy, says Hungary's Prime Minister who's fighting the globalists, Orbán's bold vision explained.
[00:27:34.175 --> 00:27:35.336]  This is the answer.
[00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:41.200]  They want to get rid of it, just like the goals of communism.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.123]  All right, now when we come back, I'm going to shift gears out of that and into the big
[00:27:46.502 --> 00:27:55.665]  Insulata, I have known that QAnon was a consortium of six or seven real military intelligence individuals with their view.
[00:27:55.665 --> 00:28:00.487]  Didn't mean it was all accurate or all perfect, but I've known for about six months who some of them are by name.
[00:28:00.487 --> 00:28:02.968]  And the White House said, yeah, we kind of like the things QAnon's saying.
[00:28:02.968 --> 00:28:05.668]  They told Corsi that, and I was also told that by another source.
[00:28:05.668 --> 00:28:07.209]  That was somebody below the president.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.500]  But the last few months has been going sideways.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.881]  I've had some private discussions, you know, disagreeing with folks that still thought QAnon was real.
[00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:18.602]  And I just said, I'm not doing any more QAnon coverage.
[00:28:18.602 --> 00:28:34.985]  Well, this morning I talked to some folks while they were out playing golf, some officers, and went ahead and had a chance to talk to the original individual, let's just say Q, but that's a consortium, and not Q that does some security work.
[00:28:34.985 --> 00:28:37.306]  Q's not associated with it, even though he is in Florida as well.
[00:28:39.946 --> 00:28:44.328]  Where you've got Central Command and all the rest of it, Special Operations Command.
[00:28:44.328 --> 00:28:55.211]  So, we're gonna just go ahead and tell you, Q has been compromised, the identity's been taken over by a deep state group that is attempting to also destroy the presidency and the Make America Great Again reboot.
[00:28:55.211 --> 00:28:56.672]  We'll be back with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:28:56.672 --> 00:28:57.072]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.463 --> 00:29:02.505]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[00:29:02.505 --> 00:29:06.487]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[00:29:06.487 --> 00:29:07.748]  The Bug Assault.
[00:29:07.748 --> 00:29:12.690]  A miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.

[00:29:33.102 --> 00:29:35.803]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[00:29:35.803 --> 00:29:41.126]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[00:29:41.126 --> 00:29:46.810]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.252]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[00:29:50.252 --> 00:29:53.354]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them the library, to give them the church.

[00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:07.001]  It'd take hours.
[00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:09.422]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:30:09.422 --> 00:30:10.602]  It's stronger.
[00:30:10.602 --> 00:30:12.222]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:30:12.222 --> 00:30:15.443]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:30:15.443 --> 00:30:16.563]  It's back in stock.
[00:30:16.563 --> 00:30:19.744]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:30:19.744 --> 00:30:23.525]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:30:23.525 --> 00:30:26.625]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[00:30:26.625 --> 00:30:27.506]  So you can upload it.
[00:30:27.506 --> 00:30:28.946]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[00:30:29.406 --> 00:30:32.167]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:30:59.993 --> 00:31:01.894]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:31:01.894 --> 00:31:03.155]  Go ahead.
[00:31:03.155 --> 00:31:05.077]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:31:05.077 --> 00:31:15.584]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:18.946]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:31:19.486 --> 00:31:19.926]  Thank you.
[00:31:19.926 --> 00:31:20.307]  Thank you.
[00:31:20.307 --> 00:31:20.827]  Absolutely.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:55.096]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:31:59.991 --> 00:32:02.312]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:05.601]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.167 --> 00:33:26.050]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:34.837]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.837 --> 00:33:37.739]  One of my sources is the President of the United States.
[00:33:37.739 --> 00:33:41.001]  Haven't talked to him in a while, but that's on record.
[00:33:41.001 --> 00:33:45.524]  I have other sources that are in Congress, the Senate, the House.
[00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:48.967]  I have sources that are governors, governor staff.
[00:33:50.163 --> 00:33:57.347]  I have sources in the Pentagon, I have sources in the CIA, I have sources in corporate America, I have sources in Clear Channel.
[00:33:57.347 --> 00:34:00.689]  I have hundreds and hundreds of really good sources.
[00:34:00.689 --> 00:34:03.190]  But my best source is you, the American people.
[00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:19.159]  The folks four months ago that sent us the secret George Soros documents that were confirmed to be accurate, that there was zero news coverage of, of Obama planning martial law in 2012 in blue cities, staging riots with the police and Antifa, trying to get
[00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:26.662]  ...the black population to riot, to bring in the Strong Cities Initiative and you in control of local cities.
[00:34:26.662 --> 00:34:30.364]  That's mainstream news that Loretta Lynch wanted that.
[00:34:30.364 --> 00:34:31.825]  This is diabolical.
[00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.511]  And that's what people like Maxine Waters are doing.
[00:34:36.511 --> 00:34:44.413]  We have the full speech coming up next hour, where this congressman is going, and we're all working together and getting factories back, black and white, living side by side.
[00:34:44.413 --> 00:34:52.595]  Doesn't matter what color you are, a man or a woman, black or white, and you're working on the factory, you're getting a good job, and that's how we come together.
[00:34:52.595 --> 00:34:56.876]  And Waters just flips out and goes, I resent Make America Great Again!
[00:34:56.876 --> 00:34:59.617]  You shut your mouth, you horrible person!
[00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:07.590]  And you realize these people are evil.
[00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.811]  But that's the traitors LBJ and others hired.
[00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:17.675]  I mean, you're a grand dragon, or a dragon, in the KKK, like Byrd or any of these people.
[00:35:17.675 --> 00:35:21.377]  What are you going to do when you're a Dixiecrat like the Clintons?
[00:35:21.377 --> 00:35:23.898]  And most of the people in the South are Christians and they're not racist.
[00:35:26.294 --> 00:35:27.614]  And everybody's going Republican.
[00:35:27.614 --> 00:35:30.996]  You just flip around and go, I'm your friend now, black people.
[00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:38.938]  I'm a good Southern gentleman, Bill Clinton, Robert Byrd, good old Texas man, LBJ.
[00:35:38.938 --> 00:35:42.600]  I'm going to help you out now, fine Southern gentleman.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.980]  You can't have a man in the house.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:48.762]  We're going to give you some gangster rap here and ship cocaine to your neighborhood, but that'll be all right, won't it?
[00:35:52.819 --> 00:35:58.681]  Fine southern gentlemen like Bill Clinton who, when he ran for governor, had the rebel flag.
[00:35:58.681 --> 00:36:04.904]  And I'm not saying the rebel flag is even what the left says it is, but come on, man, imagine if Trump would ever run on the rebel flag.
[00:36:04.904 --> 00:36:06.044]  It's crazy!
[00:36:06.044 --> 00:36:11.507]  Or to be technical, the Confederate battle flag!
[00:36:11.507 --> 00:36:12.967]  Which I must say is a handsome flag.
[00:36:12.967 --> 00:36:14.288]  It has nothing to do with slavery.
[00:36:14.288 --> 00:36:16.889]  But it's all been turned into that, so what does it matter?
[00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:19.030]  Like the word gay used to mean happy.
[00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.910]  Now it means something else.
[00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:24.593]  A fag used to be a burning ember, a cigarette.
[00:36:24.593 --> 00:36:27.013]  They still call it that day when someone says, hey, give me a fag.
[00:36:27.013 --> 00:36:28.754]  Somebody else with a cigarette, you're like, a fag?
[00:36:28.754 --> 00:36:30.794]  They're like, there it is.
[00:36:30.794 --> 00:36:33.655]  So we're gonna go to Dr. Corsi this segment, the next, a little bit the next hour.
[00:36:33.655 --> 00:36:41.116]  And then we've got PJW hosting with me, Mark Randazzo, one of the top first amendment lawyers, a great guy, in studio.
[00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:43.637]  Not talking about our cases, but a lot of the others.
[00:36:43.637 --> 00:36:46.938]  Joel Gilbert, always doing a great job, host of the fourth hour.
[00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:48.918]  But before we go to Corsi on this big announcement,
[00:36:50.629 --> 00:36:51.833]  Please support the broadcast.
[00:36:51.833 --> 00:36:53.378]  There's a reason they're coming after us.
[00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.666]  The globalists know we have sources that are high-level.
[00:36:58.066 --> 00:37:00.027]  But more importantly, we're the big source.
[00:37:00.027 --> 00:37:01.428]  You, the audience, our guests.
[00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:09.392]  This operation is listened to by militaries around the world, by intelligence agencies, because it's one of the only places where you're having a real open discussion.
[00:37:09.392 --> 00:37:14.335]  And we're funded by you, not by Jeff Bezos, not funded by George Soros, no.
[00:37:14.335 --> 00:37:19.237]  Not the Democratic Party, not the Mercers, I'm not saying they're bad people, or any of these folks.
[00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:26.541]  Everybody else, except for Matt Drudge and us, and that's basically it, is funded by the establishment.
[00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:35.382]  And, I remember the first time I wanted to get Milo on, he had to get permission from the Mercers to come on.
[00:37:35.382 --> 00:37:37.504]  I mean, I'm not putting Milo down, he's a great guy.
[00:37:37.504 --> 00:37:40.927]  I mean, I agree with a lot of his politics, I agree with some of the lifestyle stuff.
[00:37:40.927 --> 00:37:45.231]  But he has his free speech, and he was one of the people to first be banned off the internet, basically.
[00:37:45.231 --> 00:37:46.813]  Twitter, you name it.
[00:37:46.813 --> 00:37:47.894]  So this is hardcore.
[00:37:47.894 --> 00:37:50.116]  This is serious, folks.
[00:37:50.116 --> 00:37:52.218]  We need your financial support.
[00:37:52.218 --> 00:37:52.979]  And we make it easy.
[00:37:54.062 --> 00:37:58.924]  I go out and I say, what is the best-selling supplements in the country and what works the best?
[00:37:58.924 --> 00:38:09.669]  Well, everybody loves turmeric for a decade because of the thousands of studies on what it does for inflammation, cells, energy, stamina, you name it.
[00:38:09.669 --> 00:38:13.691]  Works better on me when I hurt something than Advil.
[00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.772]  And I'm not comparing it to that, you know, toxic garbage.
[00:38:15.772 --> 00:38:17.573]  The point is, Advil really does work.
[00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:21.332]  Well, for me, it works even better.
[00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:27.015]  You can read the hundreds and hundreds of reviews, because it's a newer product, at InfoWarsLive.com.

[00:39:20.453 --> 00:39:30.658]  Now, QAnon put out a lot of exclusive info that was accurate, made a lot of predictions that were accurate up front.
[00:39:30.658 --> 00:39:34.160]  Then a lot of things started to be said that weren't exactly accurate, or didn't happen.
[00:39:35.538 --> 00:39:42.882]  And then I noticed mainstream media and online, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube wouldn't block you when you were promoting that.
[00:39:42.882 --> 00:39:44.323]  And I thought, that's a little suspicious.
[00:39:44.323 --> 00:39:46.504]  But I talked to people I know in the military and others.
[00:39:46.504 --> 00:39:49.966]  They said, no, we know some of the people on those boards using that name.
[00:39:49.966 --> 00:39:51.967]  There's only five or six people.
[00:39:51.967 --> 00:40:01.733]  But then it started getting a little bit weird and they said, no, somebody's hijacked it and basically hacked it and is using it and is now putting out disinformation.
[00:40:02.708 --> 00:40:05.671]  But separately, people like Zach, super good source.
[00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:08.114]  I know his full name, who he is.
[00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:10.337]  We got a lot of other big sources in the military.
[00:40:10.337 --> 00:40:17.485]  I mean, I've got sources, I'm not going to say from what units or groups, but the most elite, of the most elite, highest level, we have it.
[00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:20.170]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:25.174]  CIA, Dev Group, Delta Force, you name it, all of it.
[00:40:25.174 --> 00:40:26.114]  Whole nine yards.
[00:40:26.114 --> 00:40:27.395]  Because they're patriots.
[00:40:27.395 --> 00:40:30.798]  And they know what this country is in right now, where we're going.
[00:40:30.798 --> 00:40:33.640]  And Dr. Corsi's written three number one New York Times bestsellers.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.560]  He's changed elections.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.041]  He's got amazing sources.
[00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:39.704]  He got told by the White House six months ago, hey, we like QAnon.
[00:40:39.704 --> 00:40:41.025]  But now that's not the case.
[00:40:41.025 --> 00:40:45.188]  And so I was on the phone this morning, talked to some folks who are out playing golf with
[00:40:46.325 --> 00:40:49.947]  People that have been involved in QAnon, they say, hey, that's been taken over.
[00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.587]  We're unable to even post anymore.
[00:40:51.587 --> 00:40:52.788]  That's not us anymore.
[00:40:52.788 --> 00:40:58.330]  And then Corsi was riding the same line two days ago in private conversations we had, saying, hey, it's been compromised.
[00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.111]  Then I didn't even talk about it on air.
[00:41:00.111 --> 00:41:01.972]  Then I was separately told this by QAnon.
[00:41:01.972 --> 00:41:03.233]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:41:03.233 --> 00:41:06.494]  I've talked to QAnon.
[00:41:06.494 --> 00:41:09.275]  There's only about five, six people that have actually been posting.
[00:41:09.275 --> 00:41:10.576]  I've talked to QAnon.
[00:41:10.576 --> 00:41:12.617]  And they're saying QAnon is no longer QAnon.
[00:41:12.617 --> 00:41:14.518]  So, Dr. Corsi, tell us about your angle on this.
[00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.213]  Well, it's very similar to yours, I think, Alex.
[00:41:18.213 --> 00:41:18.913]  You're correct.
[00:41:18.913 --> 00:41:22.837]  I think the White House, for a long time, did support QAnon.
[00:41:22.837 --> 00:41:24.619]  I've been following it since December.
[00:41:24.619 --> 00:41:28.923]  And then, periodically, there would be cyber attacks and it would shift.
[00:41:28.923 --> 00:41:33.367]  It was clear that the QAnon identity was under attack.
[00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:36.690]  The real shift occurred, really, on April 28th.
[00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.473]  That's when I really concluded, began concluding, that
[00:41:40.129 --> 00:41:53.260]  QAnon was now completely hijacked by a psych op operation that had hijacked the identity and was starting to publish disinformation designed to destroy the movement and dividing the movement.
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:57.563]  The posts changed in quality and their content.
[00:41:57.563 --> 00:42:01.446]  We started to get attacks on people profiteering, making money.
[00:42:01.446 --> 00:42:03.648]  You know, you can't make any money on the
[00:42:04.977 --> 00:42:06.477]  Patriot Movement, if you make any money here.
[00:42:06.477 --> 00:42:10.658]  So we're starting to see a fog of confusion attacking the platforms, yes.
[00:42:10.658 --> 00:42:17.360]  And no leader, I mean, first of all, no leader like QAnon, why would you attack prominent spokespeople in, you know, in the movement?
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.181]  Attacking, you know, me for writing a book and making money on writing a book.
[00:42:22.181 --> 00:42:25.322]  And so I began to get then just, you know, inundated
[00:42:26.056 --> 00:42:39.127]  With troll-type emails and postings on Twitter attacking me for profiteering, even though I've been one of the most prominent supporters of Q, the whole movement began to turn on me.
[00:42:39.127 --> 00:42:45.353]  And by the way, your book is about the conspiracy to overthrow the president with the fake Russiagate, nothing to do with QAnon, even though there's some in the book.
[00:42:45.353 --> 00:42:46.594]  So that's how the distraction began.
[00:42:46.894 --> 00:42:48.476]  So the identity got grabbed.
[00:42:48.476 --> 00:42:54.443]  You, one of the people promoting the original, real QAnon, began getting demonized as the public spokesperson, basically, of QAnon.
[00:42:54.443 --> 00:42:55.745]  I mean, that's what you've become.
[00:42:55.745 --> 00:42:58.067]  And so now we go the rest of the way.
[00:42:58.067 --> 00:42:59.409]  But I was told months ago it was confirmation.
[00:42:59.409 --> 00:43:01.291]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:43:01.291 --> 00:43:01.692]  Go ahead.
[00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.212]  I just have to say something, man.
[00:43:04.212 --> 00:43:08.076]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:43:08.076 --> 00:43:09.497]  It just gets old, man.
[00:43:09.497 --> 00:43:11.919]  I'm going to shut you down right now, Ted.
[00:43:11.919 --> 00:43:14.241]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:18.245]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:43:18.245 --> 00:43:20.687]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:43:21.548 --> 00:43:24.230]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.591]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[00:43:25.591 --> 00:43:26.691]  Us being shut down?
[00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:28.192]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:43:28.192 --> 00:43:29.273]  You know what, Alex?
[00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.354]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[00:43:30.354 --> 00:43:31.454]  Hey, Frank!
[00:43:31.454 --> 00:43:37.118]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:43:37.118 --> 00:43:41.641]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:43:41.641 --> 00:43:44.522]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:43:44.522 --> 00:43:45.243]  Do you understand?
[00:43:45.243 --> 00:43:46.884]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:43:46.884 --> 00:43:48.004]  I need your help, Frank!

[00:43:56.587 --> 00:43:59.067]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:43:59.067 --> 00:44:03.048]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.

[00:44:59.824 --> 00:45:10.432]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.432 --> 00:45:12.494]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.494 --> 00:45:15.356]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.356 --> 00:45:16.857]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:16.857 --> 00:45:19.980]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:20.640]  Absolutely.
[00:45:40.546 --> 00:45:52.278]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:45:52.278 --> 00:45:55.561]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:58.784]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:59.878 --> 00:46:02.900]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.102]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[00:46:07.102 --> 00:46:14.427]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[00:46:14.427 --> 00:46:17.549]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[00:46:18.269 --> 00:46:37.754]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[00:46:38.314 --> 00:46:42.436]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[00:46:42.436 --> 00:46:53.680]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:03.884]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[00:47:03.884 --> 00:47:06.725]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:18.755]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:47:18.755 --> 00:47:21.897]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:21.897 --> 00:47:28.962]  So, there's a civil war going on in this country between the Tories, those that are with the globalists, the big robber barons, the internationalists.
[00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:49.567]  ...who want to end sovereignty and end the free market for the general public, and nationalists like Trump who says he wants a victory for the world, he wants world peace, he wants economic development, he doesn't want a strategy of tension, a strategy of destabilization, but a very good, pragmatic strategy of development.
[00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:53.871]  We haven't had that since, really, Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:59.262]  Kennedy was in over his head, somebody that Dr. Corsi knew when he was a youngster.
[00:47:59.262 --> 00:48:00.122]  And they killed him.
[00:48:00.122 --> 00:48:16.350]  But if you read the 45 secret goals of communism leaked to Congress in 1963 that we've just posted to Infowars.com, you will see that communism is an instrument of the robber baron class to sabotage society and to sabotage culture.
[00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.591]  That's on Infowars.com right now.
[00:48:18.591 --> 00:48:19.571]  Please get it out to everybody.
[00:48:19.571 --> 00:48:20.552]  Now going back to Dr. Corsi.
[00:48:22.281 --> 00:48:26.725]  The reason this is important, obviously, is QAnon was a good source.
[00:48:26.725 --> 00:48:28.387]  I talked to my military folks.
[00:48:28.387 --> 00:48:29.388]  They ferried it into it.
[00:48:29.388 --> 00:48:33.772]  They actually know some of the people involved with it, with people acting on their own.
[00:48:33.772 --> 00:48:38.216]  They weren't giving anything secret, but they were showing that they knew what was about to happen on some issues to get credibility.
[00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:46.880]  My concern was that could have been a setup to get people's confidence and then sit there and put out a bunch of disinfo.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.923]  But then I talked to some others and they said, no, overall those are some good people.
[00:48:50.923 --> 00:48:56.408]  But how they do it is they go into the 4chan, they hack it, they take down the links, they put out a fog.
[00:48:57.887 --> 00:49:05.233]  Then they start attacking people that had been supporting the real QAnon to basically just destroy the entire thing and discredit it.
[00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:14.361]  And that's why I was always saying I'll focus on it, but my main focus is just public intelligence, human intelligence, the major trends, what we know is unfolding.
[00:49:14.821 --> 00:49:17.244]  And we know there is a war going on inside the deep state.
[00:49:17.244 --> 00:49:22.830]  So the narrative being put out by QAnon before was one of hope and truth and very, very positive.
[00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.172]  Now it's one of infighting and destruction.
[00:49:25.172 --> 00:49:32.640]  So I just think we should recap what's happened, get into the latest, and then basically stick a fork in the avatar of QAnon.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.224]  It is now an overrun disinformation fount, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.262]  Well, I agree with everything you said, Alex.
[00:49:39.262 --> 00:49:43.125]  This is a now completely compromised source.
[00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:51.893]  The psych-op that took over QAnon, and I see now, I think there's signs of NASA being involved at this point.
[00:49:52.532 --> 00:50:02.758]  But the board, you know, the 8chan board has now been overrun with, I think, increasingly CIA operatives posing as trolls, posing disinformation.
[00:50:02.758 --> 00:50:08.602]  Certainly, the attack I've gotten in the last 48 hours after saying the QAnon was compromised
[00:50:09.422 --> 00:50:16.847]  On my Twitter feed and my emails have just been obviously hate-generated PSYCOP operations.
[00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:17.228]  That's right.
[00:50:17.228 --> 00:50:21.571]  This isn't just a few kids with hot pockets in their mother's basement playing video games.
[00:50:21.571 --> 00:50:27.175]  This is them taking control of the symbol of QAnon and now weaponizing it.
[00:50:27.175 --> 00:50:32.118]  And the goal seems to be that the PSYCOP taking hold of it is going to destroy the movement.
[00:50:32.668 --> 00:50:34.009]  What is in the Clinton Foundation?
[00:50:34.009 --> 00:50:35.270]  Not their new, bigger one.
[00:50:47.697 --> 00:50:59.231]  The original Library Foundation documents that Judicial Watch and World Net Daily got, over 70,000 pages, they said the number one thing is don't let Christians, conservatives, or nationalists ever build an economy.
[00:50:59.231 --> 00:51:05.018]  The number one rule is call them conspiracy theorists, and the number two rule is always attack profiting.
[00:51:05.018 --> 00:51:06.660]  Don't let them create an economy.
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.120]  Precisely.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.461]  And that's what QAnon has done.
[00:51:09.461 --> 00:51:14.683]  Now, what leader divides their own followers by this kind of a comment?
[00:51:14.683 --> 00:51:18.465]  And besides, look at President Trump yesterday in Indiana.
[00:51:18.465 --> 00:51:21.086]  He said, you know, let's make wealth great again.
[00:51:21.086 --> 00:51:22.347]  Listen, listen, off record.
[00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:43.379]  Of course, I told you through an Army Special Operations source, who you talk to, don't say any first names either, who's been in, you know, most elite Army units, multi-group units there are, that they told you, we told you months ago, that it was being compromised and that it had been compromised and they were going to operate like they were good until they built the movement to try to take control of it.
[00:51:43.379 --> 00:51:44.279]  So it's already destroyed.
[00:51:44.279 --> 00:51:46.540]  I mean, did we not a few months ago on a phone call in here?
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.162]  Yes, you warned me on this several times.
[00:51:49.162 --> 00:51:52.284]  You understand that source you were talking to has been... Yes, I did.
[00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:53.763]  It was credible.
[00:51:53.763 --> 00:51:54.564]  It was a real source.
[00:51:54.564 --> 00:51:59.487]  Well, that source is... We've got sources all over the place, bigger than the original QAnon people.
[00:51:59.487 --> 00:51:59.807]  I know.
[00:51:59.807 --> 00:52:04.130]  I was on the phone this morning with the real people.
[00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:05.191]  Right.
[00:52:05.191 --> 00:52:07.172]  Well, I mean, the real people have been identified.
[00:52:07.172 --> 00:52:10.955]  I had a pretty good idea who they were at the very beginning.
[00:52:11.605 --> 00:52:14.466]  As I went into it, the identification became clearer and clearer.
[00:52:14.466 --> 00:52:22.150]  I mean, the groups that originally put this together were military intelligence and very loyal to General Flynn.
[00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:26.612]  And the goal was to, you know, provide enough of the background information... And that's exactly right!
[00:52:26.612 --> 00:52:28.773]  And that was the group out playing golf this morning.
[00:52:28.773 --> 00:52:30.354]  That's exactly right.
[00:52:30.354 --> 00:52:32.735]  And that group, I think, is the group that now...
[00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.532]  There's some background noise that'll go away.
[00:52:35.532 --> 00:52:36.012]  That's okay.
[00:52:36.012 --> 00:52:36.773]  We don't mind the lawnmower.
[00:52:36.773 --> 00:52:37.433]  It's kind of soothing.
[00:52:37.433 --> 00:52:42.017]  That lawnmower is going on enough that I can do about it at the moment.
[00:52:42.017 --> 00:52:48.802]  Look, the key element here is now you're looking at something that can be generated by artificial intelligence.
[00:52:48.802 --> 00:52:52.385]  And there's no reason it can't be generated by artificial intelligence.
[00:52:52.385 --> 00:52:54.066]  These are just now formulaic.
[00:52:54.679 --> 00:52:56.981]  You know, all open source.
[00:52:56.981 --> 00:52:58.883]  They can be decoded by open source.
[00:52:58.883 --> 00:53:03.967]  So you get a, you know, a few inflammatory statements that, you know, promising boom, boom, boom.
[00:53:03.967 --> 00:53:06.109]  We're going to have these big developments.
[00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:10.692]  A bunch of cryptic questions and a few open source references.
[00:53:10.692 --> 00:53:11.693]  And that's all Q is.
[00:53:11.693 --> 00:53:13.555]  And then it's buried inside it.
[00:53:14.264 --> 00:53:30.456]  Are now attacks, which are basically socialistic New World Order attacks, intended to divide the movement and to drive out of the movement anybody who's a real patriot, anybody who has supported President Trump and opposed the New World Order.
[00:53:30.456 --> 00:53:35.340]  That's the goal of the Psycops, is to take over the movement and divide it and then destroy it.
[00:53:36.806 --> 00:53:47.400]  We just put on screen the London Guardian saying exactly that and admitting and that they've had for decades already these automated systems, not artificially intelligent in the classical sense, but automated.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.306]  Now they're artificially intelligent and what you're saying is they load in a few pages
[00:53:53.488 --> 00:53:56.571]  Uh, of rumors, of disinfo, of keywords.
[00:53:56.571 --> 00:54:02.318]  Then they have Facebook and Twitter and Google push that, so everybody starts pushing it because they don't get censored when they push it.
[00:54:02.318 --> 00:54:04.700]  They go, wow, my post is going viral.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.063]  Well, it's because it's disinfo the establishment wants out.
[00:54:07.864 --> 00:54:08.124]  We're good
[00:54:26.238 --> 00:54:30.400]  Force-fed millions of views instead of blocking us and shadow banning.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.121]  So then I made some phone calls.
[00:54:32.121 --> 00:54:34.062]  They said, oh yeah, it's definitely not the same people.
[00:54:34.062 --> 00:54:35.703]  It was a group of folks before.
[00:54:35.703 --> 00:54:36.864]  They've taken over the identities.
[00:54:36.864 --> 00:54:37.824]  They've blocked them.
[00:54:37.824 --> 00:54:39.325]  They've basically penetrated 4chan.
[00:54:39.325 --> 00:54:48.070]  They're in control of those boards at the management level and are force-feeding these false avatars.
[00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:51.212]  And so I'm glad we're in agreement on this because I talked to the folks finally this morning.
[00:54:52.065 --> 00:54:58.748]  And they said yes that that is indeed what is going on and indeed what is what is happening.
[00:54:58.748 --> 00:55:05.511]  So basically we can just stick a fork in it and move on and believe nothing that comes out of the avatar QAnon.
[00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:07.712]  That is now synonymous with disinformation.
[00:55:08.513 --> 00:55:17.799]  Correct, and it's going to get worse, because the movement now controlled by psych-ops is going to do everything they can to further divide the Donald Trump supporters.
[00:55:17.799 --> 00:55:25.545]  Those who are believing it, who want an intelligence source internally that they think they can trust, are just going to get fooled and misled.
[00:55:26.385 --> 00:55:27.906]  Even the photographs.
[00:55:27.906 --> 00:55:31.868]  Photographs are largely, I mean, posting a photograph of Singapore.
[00:55:31.868 --> 00:55:33.649]  Well, that's not intelligence.
[00:55:33.649 --> 00:55:40.452]  Everybody knows it was announced by the White House yesterday that President Trump is going to meet with North Korea in Singapore.
[00:55:40.452 --> 00:55:49.337]  So we're going to go from, you know, some good intelligence that was legitimately dropped by the QAnon identity originally, and I think even through April 28th,
[00:55:50.422 --> 00:55:52.764]  And now it's 100% co-opted.
[00:55:52.764 --> 00:55:54.907]  The attack on the board was even reported.
[00:55:54.907 --> 00:55:56.708]  It was documented.
[00:55:56.708 --> 00:56:03.235]  The board administrator still doesn't believe he's been compromised or hijacked.
[00:56:03.235 --> 00:56:05.016]  You know, cyber attack.
[00:56:05.016 --> 00:56:07.519]  But I assure you, between the NASA
[00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:16.277]  The NSA, the CIA, anything on a computer can be compromised and hijacked, and people using it may not even know.
[00:56:16.277 --> 00:56:20.239]  That's how effective a CIOP operation can be.
[00:56:22.728 --> 00:56:26.231]  Fifteen years ago they were called sock puppets or bullhorns.
[00:56:26.231 --> 00:56:29.153]  The US has them, Israel has them, everybody has them.
[00:56:29.153 --> 00:56:33.997]  And again, you load in the data you want, and then it goes out and pushes it as AI.
[00:56:33.997 --> 00:56:38.962]  Other people then join it, who are real, then it recruits them as moderators in an internet movement.
[00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:41.483]  Just like you do with your own website.
[00:56:41.483 --> 00:56:55.668]  And then they roll those out, weaponize now with real people, just like the Russian bots that the Democrats paid for to have protests outside of Trump Tower that Michael Moore attended last year when he had been elected president.
[00:56:55.668 --> 00:56:59.209]  Michael Moore didn't know that he was at a Russian bot funded event.
[00:56:59.209 --> 00:57:02.511]  So no wonder Hillary said it was Russians, because 80% of it was funded by the Democrats.
[00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:06.035]  Because there's a bunch of troll farms you can hire in different countries.
[00:57:06.035 --> 00:57:17.952]  So there were Russian bots, they were just working for the Democrats, and Russian bots were able to then create a big protest with over a thousand people in front of Trump Tower with even Michael Moore not knowing.
[00:57:17.952 --> 00:57:19.114]  That's the power of AI.
[00:57:20.658 --> 00:57:34.128]  And what they do also is, you know, you've got the ability here to do a program, a psych-op program, where you ask these questions, and so it says loyal, disloyal, and you know, these different dichotomies.
[00:57:34.128 --> 00:57:38.090]  You punch the button, and it generates out cryptic questions for you.
[00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:46.036]  The whole thing is... They've basically created a little mind-control video game, choose-your-own-adventure thing that they're manipulating people with, and so folks should know that.
[00:57:46.036 --> 00:57:46.736]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.736 --> 00:57:47.257]  Stay with us.
[00:57:47.257 --> 00:57:48.938]  Anything anonymous is always dangerous.
[00:57:49.218 --> 00:57:55.582]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:57:55.582 --> 00:57:58.804]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:57:58.804 --> 00:58:02.507]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:58:02.507 --> 00:58:07.209]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:58:07.209 --> 00:58:10.472]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:58:11.352 --> 00:58:22.357]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:58:22.357 --> 00:58:30.900]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[00:58:32.521 --> 00:58:41.573]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:59:41.187 --> 00:59:42.308]  That means it's pure.
[00:59:42.308 --> 00:59:45.211]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:59:45.211 --> 00:59:48.015]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:59:48.015 --> 00:59:53.321]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:59:53.321 --> 00:59:55.944]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:34.489]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:34.489 --> 01:00:37.873]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.873 --> 01:00:42.838]  Look, there's so much disinfo, so many bots that these big megacorporations are throwing at us.
[01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:46.142]  We just have to know Americana, free market, Christianity.
[01:00:47.003 --> 01:00:49.405]  Free Open Society, and promote that.
[01:00:49.405 --> 01:01:01.013]  Anytime you get into all this anonymous stuff, unless it's sources that you've known for years and years, like InfoWars, that then has sources that we know the identity of, that we know have given us good information in the past.
[01:01:01.013 --> 01:01:04.175]  And still, you can get set up down the road on that.
[01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:06.877]  But that's why InfoWars is so attacked, because the public trusts it.
[01:01:07.777 --> 01:01:09.278]  And say hi to CENTCOM.
[01:01:09.278 --> 01:01:13.040]  They got us on a big projector in one of the meeting rooms in there right now.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.301]  Some folks are watching, Dr. Corsi.
[01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:19.663]  They're very interested in this whole QAnon thing as well.
[01:01:19.663 --> 01:01:27.306]  I just hope we can move on from it because, you know, we have so many anonymous sources that are real, that are documented, not anonymous to us.
[01:01:27.306 --> 01:01:29.207]  And then the media just ignores it.
[01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:32.729]  But then the way they pick up QAnon, you could see where the trap was going.
[01:01:32.729 --> 01:01:34.890]  So, Dr. Corsi, any other points you'd like to add?
[01:01:35.569 --> 01:01:42.172]  Well, I think that now that we see the Q identity has been compromised by a PSYCOP and, you know, a PSYOP is in charge.
[01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:58.850]  We ought to just start coming forward with much more of our own deep source information, which, you know, I've been filtering through QAnon, basically utilizing it as a vehicle so that information we independently had could be blended into the QAnon story.
[01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:03.031]  That's been largely my methodology in the decodes I've been doing.
[01:02:03.031 --> 01:02:10.093]  So I think we need to just quit that and go directly with our own sources and our own intelligence information, because right now we're at a critical point.
[01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:10.593]  This is the
[01:02:11.337 --> 01:02:23.600]  Point at which I believe the Trump administration is positioning to fire Mueller or put Mueller under criminal investigation himself for the Uranium One cover-up that he did, which I think was criminal.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:35.844]  And Trump is about to launch into a serious counter-attack, in which I believe Sessions has to be fired, Rosenstein has to be fired, and I think what this signals, I think, Alex, is we ought to
[01:02:36.744 --> 01:02:45.232]  Go more directly even now, even ramp it up with our own internal intelligence information that we can share with the public.
[01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:49.636]  I mean, not anything classified, nothing that is, you know, top secret.
[01:02:49.636 --> 01:03:01.987]  I'm not interested in dealing in classified information, but the own interpretations and directions we're getting pointed in by the intelligence sources you and I both work with almost on an everyday basis.
[01:03:03.732 --> 01:03:05.913]  Well, that was my issue with QAnon the whole time.
[01:03:05.913 --> 01:03:06.993]  Some of the stuff was accurate.
[01:03:06.993 --> 01:03:07.713]  Some of it was good.
[01:03:07.713 --> 01:03:11.734]  A lot of it was just publicly available information.
[01:03:11.734 --> 01:03:18.055]  And then I had the hostage rescue team tell me he went to the Middle East.
[01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:19.936]  He had a woman in there for days before.
[01:03:19.936 --> 01:03:22.116]  There was antifa paraphernalia.
[01:03:22.116 --> 01:03:24.517]  It was a gun-running deal gone bad.
[01:03:26.331 --> 01:03:29.113]  Saudi Arabia was having a big conference there.
[01:03:29.113 --> 01:03:33.975]  We believe they used the fact that he'd sold them guns before to meet to see the weapons.
[01:03:33.975 --> 01:03:37.317]  Then they used those to set him up in part of a Saudi civil war.
[01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:42.306]  And then months later, that's basically the facts that have come out.
[01:03:42.306 --> 01:03:47.188]  I mean, wow, really have sources in the Haas's rescue team.
[01:03:47.188 --> 01:03:48.549]  Really have sources in the CIA.
[01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:49.969]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:03:49.969 --> 01:03:52.470]  I don't mean like pencil pushers either.
[01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:55.411]  And I'm talking about direct action, covert action, all that.
[01:03:55.411 --> 01:03:56.992]  And they want the country to come back.
[01:03:56.992 --> 01:03:58.833]  They know the globalists have hijacked the nation.
[01:03:58.833 --> 01:04:00.313]  They know the communist Chinese.
[01:04:00.313 --> 01:04:01.574]  Dick Cheney came out yesterday.
[01:04:02.651 --> 01:04:07.512]  And said, Communist China is the threat, they've infiltrated us, they're the enemy, not the Russians.
[01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:11.253]  And not because he's a Russophile, the Chinese are the problem, people!
[01:04:11.253 --> 01:04:12.994]  Go ahead, Dr. Corsi.
[01:04:12.994 --> 01:04:18.795]  Well, and I think we've got information that has been extremely valuable that now it's time to share directly.
[01:04:18.795 --> 01:04:30.978]  I mean, one of the things I see about QAnon, as soon as the embassy was going to be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, as soon as President Trump decided to tear up the Iranian agreement,
[01:04:31.844 --> 01:04:41.333]  The anti-semitism on the Q boards and me being hit with tweets and emails... You know, I tell you what, can you come on the 4th hour today?
[01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:42.434]  This is so important.
[01:04:42.434 --> 01:04:46.217]  Just go ahead and give the big... I know you've got a lot of great sources to give us your intelligence dump.
[01:04:46.217 --> 01:04:47.478]  Can you do that?
[01:04:47.478 --> 01:04:48.419]  Yeah, I'll be delighted to.
[01:04:48.419 --> 01:04:49.520]  You're gonna host the show then.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.162]  Joel Gilbert will be fine.
[01:04:51.162 --> 01:04:53.484]  Joel Gilbert's normally hosting that, but you're gonna host the 4th hour.
[01:04:53.484 --> 01:04:54.885]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, 4th hour today.
[01:04:58.254 --> 01:05:18.249]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.249 --> 01:05:20.370]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:24.353]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:25.394]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:05:25.794 --> 01:05:31.598]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:33.980]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.621]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.621 --> 01:05:39.423]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.423 --> 01:05:41.925]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:41.925 --> 01:05:51.111]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.111 --> 01:05:55.554]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:05:59.216 --> 01:05:59.836]  We've got it.
[01:05:59.836 --> 01:06:06.340]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:10.722]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:10.722 --> 01:06:16.405]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:30.603 --> 01:06:39.767]  Well, Paul Joseph Watson, our editor of InfoWars, and we're trying to set up the London Bureau over there right now.
[01:06:39.767 --> 01:06:41.268]  Already set up the Europe Bureau.
[01:06:41.268 --> 01:06:45.049]  Got a lot of big wheels want to work with Paul.
[01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:51.352]  So we're going to be having some meetings today after the show, like busy little beavers.
[01:06:51.352 --> 01:06:54.354]  Let's just say the folks that brought you Brexit want to
[01:06:55.421 --> 01:06:57.283]  Go to the next level with Infowars.
[01:06:57.283 --> 01:06:59.444]  We're fighting hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:59.444 --> 01:07:01.546]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:07:01.546 --> 01:07:04.629]  And that's why they're out to get us.
[01:07:04.629 --> 01:07:05.810]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[01:07:05.810 --> 01:07:09.633]  Because we're promoting ice water in hell.
[01:07:09.633 --> 01:07:14.497]  Or a nice warm house at the North Pole.
[01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.279]  We're promoting Americana.
[01:07:16.279 --> 01:07:18.060]  We're promoting free market.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:21.003]  We're promoting mom and apple pie and not Venezuela collapse.
[01:07:22.537 --> 01:07:24.258]  So Paul's always loaded for bear.
[01:07:24.258 --> 01:07:25.358]  We're going to talk to him.
[01:07:25.358 --> 01:07:28.639]  He's going to co-host this hour with me about what he wants to get into.
[01:07:28.639 --> 01:07:36.662]  And then I've got several subjects after he's covered the first few segments of this hour that I want to get to.
[01:07:36.662 --> 01:07:40.464]  The secret 45 goals of communism leaked to Congress in 63.
[01:07:40.464 --> 01:07:43.205]  This is must see.
[01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:51.188]  We've published it to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:07:51.188 --> 01:07:51.508]  Also,
[01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:59.613]  We are going to look at the whole North Korea deal coming up, and the fact that Trump said, I don't really care about getting a Nobel Prize.
[01:07:59.613 --> 01:08:02.114]  I'm going to play the clip.
[01:08:02.114 --> 01:08:06.457]  I care about worldwide victory.
[01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:09.598]  Victory for the planet.
[01:08:09.598 --> 01:08:11.279]  1776 worldwide.
[01:08:11.279 --> 01:08:12.900]  True innovation.
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.041]  True age of discovery.
[01:08:15.063 --> 01:08:16.243]  Renaissance 2.0.
[01:08:16.243 --> 01:08:18.544]  I told you that's what this is.
[01:08:18.544 --> 01:08:19.785]  And you're going to start hearing it.
[01:08:19.785 --> 01:08:20.685]  You're going to start seeing it.
[01:08:20.685 --> 01:08:24.486]  I told you, with Trump it's all about energy.
[01:08:24.486 --> 01:08:26.287]  What does Jay-Z say?
[01:08:26.287 --> 01:08:28.027]  The energy of Trump.
[01:08:28.027 --> 01:08:29.788]  And his energy.
[01:08:29.788 --> 01:08:32.429]  Behind the scenes, Trump is all about energy.
[01:08:32.429 --> 01:08:33.249]  The energy.
[01:08:33.249 --> 01:08:34.909]  He loves black churches.
[01:08:34.909 --> 01:08:35.930]  The energy.
[01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:37.510]  He loves the Holy Ghost.
[01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:39.771]  Trump is becoming a very strong Christian.
[01:08:42.131 --> 01:08:43.851]  And he just likes the energy.
[01:08:43.851 --> 01:08:46.332]  Well, why wouldn't you like that energy?
[01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:51.313]  And so that scares the culture of death because they can see Trump is alive.
[01:08:51.313 --> 01:08:52.533]  He's virile.
[01:08:52.533 --> 01:08:53.533]  He's strong.
[01:08:53.533 --> 01:09:00.154]  He's not one of these so-called alphas that wants to see you be weak so they feel powerful and over you.
[01:09:00.154 --> 01:09:04.455]  We're also going to get to, as robotics and AI sprint ahead, U.S.
[01:09:04.455 --> 01:09:09.216]  must battle China for supremacy, but then battle to put the AI in full control of everything?
[01:09:09.216 --> 01:09:10.956]  There's some major pitfalls to that.
[01:09:11.949 --> 01:09:16.931]  Also, Alphabet is considering investing in Flipkart alongside Walmart.
[01:09:16.931 --> 01:09:17.931]  Insiders explain why.
[01:09:17.931 --> 01:09:22.833]  We're also going to be burrowing into this really key report next hour.
[01:09:22.833 --> 01:09:27.314]  EMP Commission warns of year-long blackout and massive death toll.
[01:09:27.314 --> 01:09:30.515]  That's the real way the globalists may try to depopulate us.
[01:09:30.515 --> 01:09:33.436]  But they'll want to build their hardened bunkers and facilities first.
[01:09:33.436 --> 01:09:35.437]  The problem is they've done that.
[01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.298]  And then, I saw this a couple weeks ago.
[01:09:38.848 --> 01:09:43.290]  And then I saw it again today when my personal trainer came over.
[01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:48.173]  He pointed out this is everywhere in his feeds on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:09:48.173 --> 01:09:50.894]  Pat Riley pointed it out.
[01:09:50.894 --> 01:09:54.456]  That Paul Watson said, hey, this young lady's an interesting reporter.
[01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:55.616]  She's coming to Southwest.
[01:09:55.616 --> 01:09:57.197]  You ought to let her be a guest reporter for a day.
[01:09:57.197 --> 01:09:59.178]  And I said, sure.
[01:09:59.178 --> 01:10:03.340]  I guess Ashton Whitty is her name.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.221]  I've only met her once briefly.
[01:10:05.221 --> 01:10:06.201]  Very nice lady.
[01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.402]  She's like 20-something years old.
[01:10:09.031 --> 01:10:19.376]  And I was getting tired of putting 20, 30, 40 videos on our YouTube and our Facebook a day because the guys told me that you should not do more than 10 because then it doesn't let the others go viral.
[01:10:19.376 --> 01:10:22.497]  So I've said, put these things on sub channels.
[01:10:22.497 --> 01:10:30.361]  So I walked in and saw like 20 videos that have been uploaded and I said, delete those.
[01:10:30.361 --> 01:10:31.861]  It's like the day after she'd been here.
[01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:33.682]  And I said, and then re-upload them on the sub channels.
[01:10:33.682 --> 01:10:34.843]  That's how we're going to build those.
[01:10:34.843 --> 01:10:35.403]  I walk out.
[01:10:36.892 --> 01:10:41.673]  The media watches us so closely, they went, Jones is scared.
[01:10:41.673 --> 01:10:43.694]  He removed this video of her.
[01:10:43.694 --> 01:10:46.675]  She's destroyed by this woman who's a genius.
[01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:48.435]  The woman can hardly talk.
[01:10:48.435 --> 01:10:53.396]  So I finally watched it, and Ashton, witty, I guess I ought to try to hire her.
[01:10:53.396 --> 01:10:54.577]  She did a great job!
[01:10:54.577 --> 01:10:59.298]  They're celebrating this, like the kid that walks up and tells Owen Schroer, F you.
[01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:01.539]  They celebrate their weakness as a victory.
[01:11:01.539 --> 01:11:02.539]  It's a total psyop.
[01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.022]  And I've never watched this clip.
[01:11:07.022 --> 01:11:13.206]  I've just seen like dozens of videos and I'm like, I told you guys, stop posting 50 videos a day on the YouTube.
[01:11:13.206 --> 01:11:15.708]  I normally raise my voice, but I said, delete them.
[01:11:15.708 --> 01:11:17.389]  They said, a lot of them are yours.
[01:11:17.389 --> 01:11:18.690]  I went, I don't care.
[01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:19.710]  Put them on sub channels.
[01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.692]  That's how we're going to build those.
[01:11:21.692 --> 01:11:21.792]  And.
[01:11:23.032 --> 01:11:26.798]  They went, oh my god, he deleted these, study what videos, why did he delete them?
[01:11:26.798 --> 01:11:36.374]  We found them over here, oh look, we found it on Twitter and we found it on Facebook, he didn't leave it there, we found it, the articles go, we found it, he tried to hide it, because we posted it there, idiots!
[01:11:39.858 --> 01:11:41.239]  But that's not the story!
[01:11:41.239 --> 01:11:58.486]  The story is how dumb this woman is and they have Teen Vogue and Newsweek and Vice and HBO celebrating her and she sounds like she's got about a 70 IQ and that she's wearing all these fancy clothes saying she loves socialism and how much she loves Venezuela.
[01:11:58.486 --> 01:12:01.807]  It's devastatingly dumb.
[01:12:01.807 --> 01:12:03.468]  So I've already covered it, I apologize.
[01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:04.268]  Let's go to Paul Watson.
[01:12:05.742 --> 01:12:07.124]  Paul Joseph Watson is here.
[01:12:07.124 --> 01:12:08.507]  We appreciate him joining us.
[01:12:08.507 --> 01:12:12.755]  Paul, what do you have in your raft, I know, of incredibly important information?
[01:12:14.577 --> 01:12:24.922]  Well, I mean, just picking up on what you just said, that girl in that video actually did an interview with Teen Vogue, because they made her into a big superstar, again, with a 70 IQ.
[01:12:24.922 --> 01:12:27.544]  She said, quote, capitalism is evil.
[01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:30.805]  OK, so she's got she's sipping on a Starbucks or whatever.
[01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:33.026]  She's got her head buried in a smartphone.
[01:12:33.026 --> 01:12:34.307]  But capitalism's evil.
[01:12:34.307 --> 01:12:38.629]  OK, so it was very bizarre how they turned the whole thing into a meme.
[01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:40.450]  But again, you were right.
[01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:42.531]  Oh, we found them deleting a video.
[01:12:42.531 --> 01:12:43.752]  This must be scandalous.
[01:12:43.752 --> 01:12:44.052]  It's like,
[01:12:44.973 --> 01:12:50.118]  It's not even that interesting of a video, but they've turned her into a superstar.
[01:12:50.118 --> 01:12:56.464]  So if that's the best they've got, the sailor socialists, then they're struggling pretty hard.
[01:12:56.464 --> 01:13:01.188]  But Alex, you were talking about energy and Trump.
[01:13:01.188 --> 01:13:03.431]  Trump obviously doesn't drink alcohol.
[01:13:03.431 --> 01:13:04.271]  I like a drink.
[01:13:04.271 --> 01:13:05.653]  You know, you like a drink.
[01:13:05.653 --> 01:13:06.614]  Most of us like a drink.
[01:13:06.614 --> 01:13:07.795]  I like to have a laugh with my friends.
[01:13:08.658 --> 01:13:18.966]  I think a lot of what we need to move towards with Infowars, aside from the politics, is basically, you know, Infowars lifestyle, and just teaching young people how to live.
[01:13:18.966 --> 01:13:26.092]  You know, there's an art to living, and one of those things is to, you know, try and get off alcohol, at least for a certain amount of time.
[01:13:26.092 --> 01:13:28.134]  You can go out with your friends, you can have a laugh.
[01:13:28.134 --> 01:13:31.016]  You know, Alex, I haven't drunk alcohol for a week.
[01:13:31.016 --> 01:13:33.118]  I like to drink, you know, a couple of times a week normally.
[01:13:33.118 --> 01:13:35.300]  I feel like a completely different person.
[01:13:35.842 --> 01:13:37.463]  You're talking about Trump being on energy.
[01:13:37.463 --> 01:13:41.367]  Of course, Trump doesn't drink because his brother died of alcohol poisoning.
[01:13:41.367 --> 01:13:43.348]  Just feel like a totally different person, Alex.
[01:13:43.348 --> 01:13:51.815]  So I think, increasingly, and tell me if you agree, we need to move towards advising young people on simply the art of living.
[01:13:51.815 --> 01:13:53.476]  I didn't even know you'd done this.
[01:13:53.476 --> 01:13:54.977]  I didn't even know you'd done this.
[01:13:54.977 --> 01:13:56.078]  Guess what I did a week ago.
[01:13:56.078 --> 01:13:57.119]  The crew knows about it.
[01:13:57.119 --> 01:13:57.840]  Guess what I did a week ago.
[01:13:59.212 --> 01:14:00.133]  Yeah.
[01:14:00.133 --> 01:14:02.734]  I mean, you feel absolutely 200% better.
[01:14:02.734 --> 01:14:04.835]  I quit drinking a week ago.
[01:14:04.835 --> 01:14:05.596]  That's crazy.
[01:14:05.596 --> 01:14:06.456]  You did it.
[01:14:06.456 --> 01:14:07.397]  We did not talk about that.
[01:14:10.066 --> 01:14:10.667]  Exactly.
[01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:13.149]  I mean, talk about energy.
[01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:16.292]  You just feel like even you're down to your dreams at night.
[01:14:16.292 --> 01:14:22.618]  I mean, I'm not saying I was an alcoholic, like I had a couple of drinks with my friends, you know, during the week or whatever, but just your dreams.
[01:14:22.618 --> 01:14:24.780]  I can just spring up out of bed.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.982]  How you get so much more done in the day.
[01:14:26.982 --> 01:14:30.025]  And it also relates to social media and checking your phone, Alex.
[01:14:30.505 --> 01:14:34.388]  Every single day, and I made a YouTube video about this, which you played on the show before.
[01:14:34.388 --> 01:14:41.833]  I tell people, especially young people, stop checking the messages on your phone every five frigging minutes, okay?
[01:14:41.833 --> 01:14:42.394]  Are you kidding?
[01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:44.035]  Younger kids do it constantly!
[01:14:44.035 --> 01:14:45.016]  They're doing it every second!
[01:14:45.476 --> 01:14:46.677]  It's horrible.
[01:14:46.677 --> 01:14:49.560]  Have you ever been with someone in their 20s?
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.643]  Like there's a, you know, the sound on Twitter where people refresh the notifications.
[01:14:53.643 --> 01:14:55.304]  It's like a plop, plop, plop.
[01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:58.947]  I've been around people who literally do that every five seconds.
[01:14:58.947 --> 01:15:05.353]  It's rewiring people's brains, making them depressed, making them lose focus, making them lose their attention span.
[01:15:05.353 --> 01:15:06.934]  It's absolutely horrific.
[01:15:07.034 --> 01:15:08.775]  Paul, this is 100th Monkey Syndrome.
[01:15:08.775 --> 01:15:31.253]  I hadn't told you this yet, but I've told the crew I want to go full-on against cell phones, full-on against the manipulation of dopamine, how the globalists emit the social engineering, and launch the anti-transhumanist movement with a foundation, officially, and then I was about to call you and say I wanted to change direction, just into saving humanity itself, because we've already exposed the globalists, and you're already on the same page.
[01:15:31.253 --> 01:15:32.354]  That is synergy.
[01:15:32.354 --> 01:15:33.515]  That is serendipity.
[01:15:33.515 --> 01:15:34.475]  That is synchronicity.
[01:15:35.396 --> 01:15:36.618]  That is destiny.
[01:15:36.618 --> 01:15:37.819]  That is magic.
[01:15:37.819 --> 01:15:39.781]  That is in the air.

[01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:49.839]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:17:58.291 --> 01:18:05.937]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:18:05.937 --> 01:18:13.843]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:18:13.843 --> 01:18:16.946]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:18:17.566 --> 01:18:22.209]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:18:22.209 --> 01:18:26.352]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:18:26.352 --> 01:18:29.494]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:18:29.494 --> 01:18:34.257]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:18:34.257 --> 01:18:37.299]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:18:37.719 --> 01:18:52.790]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:54.331]  That is critical to this fight.

[01:20:01.426 --> 01:20:04.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.824 --> 01:20:26.545]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are sending out an SOS globally to wake people up to the social engineers.
[01:20:26.545 --> 01:20:31.006]  The ultra-rich mega-billionaires are against the middle class, against the poor.
[01:20:31.006 --> 01:20:34.547]  They're all ruthless, very exploitive people, except for Donald Trump.
[01:20:34.547 --> 01:20:36.947]  And he's not perfect, but he believes in largesse.
[01:20:36.947 --> 01:20:39.988]  He believes in Africans should be able to have cars.
[01:20:39.988 --> 01:20:43.309]  Africans should be able to, you know, have air conditioning.
[01:20:43.309 --> 01:20:44.589]  But Obama went and said you can't.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:57.407]  Well now, the Daily Mail, London Telegraph reports, UK sharing hate posts, including criticism of gays, Bible verses or Islam, could lead to six months in jail under newly proposed rules.
[01:20:57.407 --> 01:20:59.769]  Well look at Count Dankula.
[01:20:59.769 --> 01:21:01.270]  He hasn't had sentencing yet.
[01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:04.232]  He's facing up to, what, a year in prison.
[01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:08.692]  For his pug being Hitler Dog.
[01:21:08.692 --> 01:21:20.140]  I actually did one with the late captain, a white French Bulldog with brown spots and grey spots who did not have hair on his nose and he looked like Hitler.
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:28.465]  I pointed out that they banned the teapot at JCPenney because somebody in the reflection thought they saw Hitler and so I said, well my God, do we have to get rid of the dog?
[01:21:28.465 --> 01:21:30.547]  You know, euthanize it because he looks like Hitler?
[01:21:31.127 --> 01:21:33.830]  But don't worry, he's dead now, buried at my parents' place.
[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:34.870]  He died of natural causes.
[01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:36.332]  In fact, he looked like Hitler.
[01:21:36.332 --> 01:21:37.613]  We apologize.
[01:21:37.613 --> 01:21:38.694]  So this is the level.
[01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:40.195]  This is here.
[01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:42.337]  There he is, ladies and gentlemen, if you're a TV viewer.
[01:21:42.337 --> 01:21:43.639]  The late Hitler.
[01:21:43.639 --> 01:21:44.199]  Dog.
[01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:45.460]  And then the teapot's even worse.
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.442]  So, Paul, it's here.
[01:21:47.442 --> 01:21:50.064]  It's now happening.
[01:21:50.064 --> 01:21:52.547]  Yeah, they're calling it hate facts.
[01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:57.150]  Okay, this is literally what Tommy Robinson was banned on Twitter for.
[01:21:57.150 --> 01:22:08.676]  He pointed out the fact that I think it was, and it's around this ballpark figure, I think it's around 89% of grooming gangs in the UK are either Pakistani Muslims or Bangladeshi Muslims.
[01:22:09.316 --> 01:22:12.557]  Now, it's in that ballpark, but he made this fact.
[01:22:12.557 --> 01:22:17.778]  It was confirmed by actual anti-extremist Muslims, like Majid Nawaz.
[01:22:17.778 --> 01:22:19.539]  He posted that on Twitter.
[01:22:19.539 --> 01:22:21.119]  That's one of the reasons why he was banned.
[01:22:21.119 --> 01:22:23.540]  They're calling them hate facts.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:29.081]  They may be true, but they're still hateful because they make a certain minority group look bad.
[01:22:29.884 --> 01:22:32.886]  You've got the same situation in other European countries.
[01:22:32.886 --> 01:22:42.712]  There was a 55-year-old in Sweden who said that migrants, Muslim migrants, are over-represented in sexual assaults and violent crime.
[01:22:42.712 --> 01:22:45.894]  Completely statistically true.
[01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:49.757]  But she put it on Facebook and was charged and fined about $1,200.
[01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:53.159]  Other people are getting actual prison time for this.
[01:22:53.159 --> 01:22:54.860]  And yeah, now they're saying they're going to consider
[01:22:56.116 --> 01:22:57.897]  Six months in jail.
[01:22:57.897 --> 01:23:05.600]  And in fact, if you read it into the details of this, they say merely influencing somebody might be a threat.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:14.904]  And in fact, they have more severe punishments for influencers with larger social media followings who post these so-called hate facts.
[01:23:14.904 --> 01:23:17.606]  And Paul, that is the precedent.
[01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:20.427]  I told my lawyers this, they now go, you're right, it's incredible.
[01:23:20.427 --> 01:23:23.608]  I've talked to dozens of top-of-the-line first-minute lawyers.
[01:23:23.608 --> 01:23:24.989]  They said, yes, we've been to conferences.
[01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:44.036]  The plan is, it's like saying ban video games, they're linked to mass shootings, they're going to say Alex Jones, Breitbart, Drudge Report, Conservatives, Donald Trump, CNN keeps saying, is going to get reporters killed, even though they're praising people that went and shot Congressman Scalia, saying that he was basically a hero, Wolf Blitzer, saying he wasn't a monster.
[01:23:44.036 --> 01:23:53.020]  They're the ones pushing all of this, and now they're saying, oh it's like firing a theater, they want the Alex Jones statute, where they misrepresent what I've said and done,
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:01.848]  And instead of precedent, when people commit crimes, the liberal police go, say Alex Jones influenced you and will let you go.
[01:24:01.848 --> 01:24:07.513]  So what you're hitting on out of Europe and the UK is the planetary plan to shut this down, to shut free speech down.
[01:24:09.159 --> 01:24:09.599]  Exactly.
[01:24:09.599 --> 01:24:16.002]  It's all about creating this new moral panic to sideline the voices that are challenging their power monopoly.
[01:24:16.002 --> 01:24:18.163]  That's what it's always been about.
[01:24:18.163 --> 01:24:29.589]  Now you've got the same situation with these deep fakes, which I know you wanted to talk about, where they now have the technology to make it look somewhat, I mean it's somewhat convincing, it's not completely convincing,
[01:24:30.029 --> 01:24:45.821]  You know, having certain political figures say things that they're not actually saying through this manipulation of video, where, as we see on screen now, they can plaster somebody else's face onto a template and make it look like somebody's saying something they're not.
[01:24:45.821 --> 01:24:49.824]  Now, you look at how the media treated this when it became a controversy.
[01:24:49.824 --> 01:24:52.066]  Last month, BuzzFeed came out with a video
[01:24:52.646 --> 01:24:59.931]  Well they had a voice actor who sounded like Barack Obama and they made Obama say these things and it wasn't completely convincing.
[01:24:59.931 --> 01:25:02.813]  The voice obviously wasn't Obama's.
[01:25:02.813 --> 01:25:09.877]  But they're saying, they're creating this hysteria saying, nobody can tell the difference, this is a horrific threat to democracy.
[01:25:09.877 --> 01:25:10.878]  And then you read down
[01:25:11.724 --> 01:25:24.484]  You watch the BuzzFeed video and they literally say the solution to these deep fakes, to this voice technology, to this face technology, the solution to it is to trust mainstream media more.
[01:25:25.231 --> 01:25:34.719]  So they're creating the moral panic and giving the solution, which is to blame it on the evil right-wingers, to blame it on the alternative media, to blame it on fake news.
[01:25:34.719 --> 01:25:43.626]  So they've rolled this deepfake controversy into their fake news hysteria, and they're going to use it to try and shut down independent media further.
[01:25:43.626 --> 01:25:47.309]  Like, we'd have a motivation to create these fakes in the first place.
[01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.631]  Well, Paul, remember Megyn Kelly before she left Fox?
[01:25:50.931 --> 01:26:07.846]  She covered Pizzagate, misrepresented everything I've said and done, and then played an edited audio, but it was actually video from the show, but it's harder to edit video because you can see the cuts, of me saying Hillary killed children in the bottom of a pizza place when I said she was responsible for killing kids in the Middle East.
[01:26:07.846 --> 01:26:12.570]  So they edited two different things together to put out the total fraud.
[01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:15.032]  So that's a low-tech way that they do this.
[01:26:16.377 --> 01:26:25.406]  Yeah, and they're using it to denigrate the value of the internet as an alternative source of information by hijacking this deepfake controversy.
[01:26:25.406 --> 01:26:30.771]  There's a Boston Globe article about it, the looming cloud deepfakes and the silver lining.
[01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:37.077]  And they say the silver lining is that now we will be trusted less, basically alternative media outlets.
[01:26:37.077 --> 01:26:37.698]  I'll read the quote.
[01:26:38.949 --> 01:26:47.576]  The author says, I can't help but consider whether the complete vaporization of truth online might actually be preferable to the uncertain state we've found ourselves in.
[01:26:47.576 --> 01:26:57.724]  If we can change our view of the internet from the information superhighway to tabloid on steroids, we may stand a chance at maintaining power over it.
[01:26:58.184 --> 01:27:21.517]  So they're saying the establishment media, the legacy media, is losing their power to alternative voices, which is what's happened over the past five, ten years, and this is a way that they can hijack that to blame us for all this deep, fake, contrived hysteria so they can retain power, maintain power over the internet and bury us in the algorithm even further.
[01:27:21.517 --> 01:27:25.339]  So they're openly saying that in their own publications now.
[01:27:25.339 --> 01:27:27.240]  Alex, you've seen the Facebook figures.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:40.425]  Literally, websites like Infowars, Gateway Pundit, since 2016's definitely accelerated in the past three months, completely decimated on Facebook in terms of engagement, in terms of shares.
[01:27:40.425 --> 01:27:42.126]  It's a deliberate policy.
[01:27:42.126 --> 01:27:43.546]  They're bragging about it.
[01:27:43.546 --> 01:27:44.387]  They're proud of it.
[01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:49.411]  We've had studies showing that this can shift millions and millions of views.
[01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:58.097]  This is why we need to be... This is the biggest subject for me going into the midterms, going into 2020, is the fact that we're all slaves to the algorithm.
[01:27:58.097 --> 01:28:09.246]  Drudge predicted this years ago on your very show, which is why we need to bring our audience back in, back home, rein it back in, and not have it sacrificed to this algorithm, which is what's happening right now.
[01:28:09.246 --> 01:28:12.528]  That's right, because next they're coming for Drudge, they're coming for InfoWars, they've said that.
[01:28:12.528 --> 01:28:14.270]  Once we're kicked off Twitter, Facebook and YouTube,
[01:28:14.970 --> 01:28:17.811]  We've always been telling folks, come to InfoWars, come to NewsWars.
[01:28:17.811 --> 01:28:20.772]  You're going to be launching your own website with us.
[01:28:20.772 --> 01:28:27.514]  That's all Watson stuff, where you talk to the fans and you post their letters they send you and you communicate with them personally.
[01:28:27.514 --> 01:28:32.315]  But through our own site, where they can't censor us, we've got to do what Drudge said and come out of these.
[01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:35.877]  These electronic ghettos that he predicted that we're now in.
[01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.078]  We've got to have Trump bust up these monopolies.
[01:28:38.078 --> 01:28:46.044]  We've got to educate the public that, yes, they're flooding the web with this info, then blaming us in a call to end the First Amendment and to end the Internet as we know it.
[01:28:46.044 --> 01:28:46.844]  That's the plan.
[01:28:46.844 --> 01:28:51.067]  News Corp talked about it three months ago, and they said first they'd take down yours truly.
[01:28:51.067 --> 01:28:51.767]  We'll be back.
[01:28:51.767 --> 01:28:54.009]  Infowars.com, while it's still there.
[01:28:57.850 --> 01:29:02.913]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:33:18.695 --> 01:33:19.595]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.994 --> 01:33:34.579]  Alright, we're going back to Paul Watson right now.
[01:33:34.579 --> 01:33:37.581]  If you just joined us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.581 --> 01:33:38.581]  I found the video.
[01:33:38.581 --> 01:33:41.442]  It's only got 362,000 views.
[01:33:41.442 --> 01:33:42.123]  That sounds like a lot.
[01:33:42.123 --> 01:33:42.523]  It's not.
[01:33:42.523 --> 01:33:44.164]  It needs 10 million views.
[01:33:44.164 --> 01:33:45.344]  Exclusive!
[01:33:45.344 --> 01:33:47.685]  Megyn Kelly caught lying to the public.
[01:33:47.685 --> 01:33:48.166]  Red-handed.
[01:33:48.846 --> 01:34:01.372]  And this is the video where I show what I really said about Hillary being responsible for dead children in the Middle East and in North Africa.
[01:34:01.372 --> 01:34:13.878]  And then I go in and I show what I really said and then how she edited it in to make it where I was saying that kids were killed in a basement of a pizza place.
[01:34:15.919 --> 01:34:24.422]  Now folks, you think about that massive, massive deception.
[01:34:24.422 --> 01:34:29.303]  Now, again, think about the level of deception of these people.
[01:34:29.303 --> 01:34:34.605]  Think about how stupid they think you are, and now they're flooding the web with even more
[01:34:35.472 --> 01:34:39.393]  The same mainstream media that told you about the WMDs.
[01:34:39.393 --> 01:34:51.976]  So the video we're going to put on screen for everybody from YouTube is titled, Exclusive, colon, Megyn Kelly caught lying to the public, comma, red handed.
[01:34:51.976 --> 01:34:56.557]  People walk me on the street, they go, how dare you say Hillary killed babies in a basement?
[01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:58.658]  And I said, I did not say that, that is edited.
[01:34:58.658 --> 01:35:01.758]  And they go, shut up, liar.
[01:35:01.758 --> 01:35:04.359]  Why don't you apologize for saying she murdered those kids?
[01:35:06.638 --> 01:35:11.041]  And then, my lawyer went to a conference this weekend in D.C.
[01:35:11.041 --> 01:35:14.964]  and they were saying the same thing, that I've gotten people killed.
[01:35:14.964 --> 01:35:21.789]  So this is like the hysteria telephone game that they have created and that they've put out.
[01:35:21.789 --> 01:35:32.176]  So go to that video and you can then see all of it there for yourself.
[01:35:32.176 --> 01:35:35.298]  What I really said versus what she aired in her incredible deception.
[01:35:36.755 --> 01:35:38.496]  And it gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:35:38.496 --> 01:35:41.157]  And imagine being the beneficiary of this.
[01:35:41.157 --> 01:35:42.317]  And I say that sarcastically.
[01:35:42.317 --> 01:35:42.937]  But you know what?
[01:35:42.937 --> 01:35:44.818]  I'm not trying to win a popularity contest.
[01:35:44.818 --> 01:35:55.683]  I'm here to force the big issues out, to be at the tip of the spear, expose this entire lying system so we all have a future.
[01:35:55.683 --> 01:36:01.765]  I'm not like all these other cowards that put their finger in the wind and try to figure out the best way to go for their own personal lives.
[01:36:01.765 --> 01:36:06.287]  Because you go that direction so long, pretty soon everything collapses.
[01:36:07.856 --> 01:36:12.658]  Everything falls apart when everybody's a yes man, when every woman's a yes person.
[01:36:12.658 --> 01:36:19.221]  When everybody goes along with whatever they think, and then pretty soon the social engineers go, we'll say mother and father's not a good thing.
[01:36:19.221 --> 01:36:22.063]  Okay, I won't say mother and father.
[01:36:22.063 --> 01:36:24.084]  Say there's no Christ.
[01:36:24.084 --> 01:36:29.046]  Say you'll let Muslims in to have holy prayer in your church or you're a racist.
[01:36:29.046 --> 01:36:35.089]  More, more, more, more, more, more, more, to see what you'll put up with, to see what you'll go along with.
[01:36:36.274 --> 01:36:38.015]  You've got to have your own rudder.
[01:36:38.015 --> 01:36:41.776]  You've got to stand for something or you will, as they say, fall for anything.
[01:36:41.776 --> 01:36:52.281]  Now, speaking of that, if you want to send a strong message to the globalists, buy our products and help us expand in the face of their attacks, not just hold on.
[01:36:52.281 --> 01:36:53.722]  And we are expanding, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:12.193]  Tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of five-star reviews from third-party top services like Power Reviews.
[01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:13.133]  No one's got 4.9 stars.

[01:38:03.997 --> 01:38:10.621]  By the way, knockout is something I never plug very, very rarely, and it is now.
[01:38:12.745 --> 01:38:24.077]  Our third best-selling product, I looked at it and I said, how much does melatonin, the normal five milligrams or whatever, how much does that normally cost when I'm buying it for $19.95?
[01:38:24.077 --> 01:38:29.262]  How much is in the average bottle, money, cost of an organic source?
[01:38:29.262 --> 01:38:30.023]  They said about a dollar.
[01:38:31.212 --> 01:38:31.372]  I think?
[01:38:51.311 --> 01:38:53.874]  No one I know says anything works better.
[01:38:53.874 --> 01:38:55.196]  Not even prescriptions.
[01:38:55.196 --> 01:39:00.283]  You've seen my lawyer, Randall Wilhite, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, none of that.
[01:39:00.283 --> 01:39:04.769]  His name's in the family court book here in Texas.
[01:39:04.769 --> 01:39:06.652]  He helps write the law for the legislature.
[01:39:08.314 --> 01:39:08.554]  Lawyer.
[01:39:08.554 --> 01:39:11.075]  So he's one of the top lawyers in the state on that.
[01:39:11.075 --> 01:39:13.335]  Used to be Racehorse Haynes' protege.
[01:39:13.335 --> 01:39:14.855]  He was a criminal lawyer.
[01:39:14.855 --> 01:39:17.596]  And he said, I did sleep studies.
[01:39:17.596 --> 01:39:18.656]  I took four different drugs.
[01:39:18.656 --> 01:39:19.156]  Couldn't sleep.
[01:39:19.156 --> 01:39:21.476]  Because for years I stayed up working overnight.
[01:39:21.476 --> 01:39:26.817]  He said, he said, now, ladies and gentlemen, he said, I take one of these and I have eight, nine hours sleep.
[01:39:26.817 --> 01:39:27.878]  It's changed my life.
[01:39:27.878 --> 01:39:29.858]  And he did a commercial for us about it.
[01:39:29.858 --> 01:39:31.858]  That's how good knockout is.
[01:39:31.858 --> 01:39:33.339]  And see, that's how I think.
[01:39:33.339 --> 01:39:33.939]  Oh, I'll solve for $19.95.
[01:39:35.799 --> 01:39:38.240]  And you'll get six, seven things in it, the same dose.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.781]  It would cost you $50, $60, $70, $100 to get all these things together in one pill for $19.95!
[01:39:43.781 --> 01:39:46.902]  Let's go to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:39:46.902 --> 01:39:49.263]  I want to cover some short subject here.
[01:39:49.263 --> 01:39:51.644]  Korea, the war, Trump, where do you see things going?
[01:39:51.644 --> 01:40:01.867]  I want to come back and get into the big picture with you, more on lifestyle and how we defeat the globalists and what are they going to do when... Do you think all their censorships and attacks are going to fail, Paul?
[01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:14.725]  Well, the polls suggest they're failing, Alex, because this whole blue wave that we've been, you know, drummed into us for the past six months, oh, the blue wave, the Democrats have got the Congress, it's guaranteed.
[01:40:14.725 --> 01:40:17.966]  Alex, they were 16 points ahead in December.
[01:40:18.624 --> 01:40:24.765]  In the race for the House, according to CNN's own poll, the latest poll has it within the margin of error.
[01:40:24.765 --> 01:40:29.346]  You know, they've lost 9% of the millennial vote since 2016.
[01:40:29.346 --> 01:40:31.246]  Where is this blue wave?
[01:40:31.246 --> 01:40:32.827]  Where's the backlash?
[01:40:32.827 --> 01:40:35.167]  Where's the resistance, Alex?
[01:40:35.167 --> 01:40:38.328]  Doesn't seem to be manifesting itself in the polls.
[01:40:38.328 --> 01:40:41.068]  Republicans had a great night on Tuesday, obviously.
[01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:45.789]  Trump is 2-1 now on the big UK betting sites to win a Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:40:46.269 --> 01:40:50.311]  You know, they've just captured or killed five top ISIS leaders.
[01:40:50.311 --> 01:40:55.572]  Imagine if Obama had captured, under his administration, five top ISIS leaders.
[01:40:55.572 --> 01:40:58.033]  They'd be kissing his butt for a week.
[01:40:58.033 --> 01:40:59.794]  It's barely a footnote.
[01:40:59.794 --> 01:41:01.335]  It's barely in the media.
[01:41:01.335 --> 01:41:05.156]  The return of the three prisoners from North Korea, barely a footnote.
[01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:11.455]  You know, when that was happening, they were talking about Michael Cohen, they were talking about Stormy Daniels.
[01:41:11.455 --> 01:41:21.783]  The six top stories on CNN when that hostage deal was taking place, and also when Israel was, you know, the bombs were flying between Israel and Syria the other night.
[01:41:21.783 --> 01:41:26.327]  The top six stories were Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels.
[01:41:26.327 --> 01:41:27.348]  Nobody cares!
[01:41:27.928 --> 01:41:31.833]  These are not platforms on which you can win national elections.
[01:41:31.833 --> 01:41:34.116]  You know, the food stamps are coming down.
[01:41:34.116 --> 01:41:36.440]  The jobless rate keeps coming down.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:43.429]  You know, if he can maintain hold of that, now even CNN, Alex, is saying in an article this week, this blue wave has become a trickle.
[01:41:43.829 --> 01:41:53.019]  And it's because they've still got no actual platform that resonates with the American people at any level because they don't care about stormy frigging Daniels.
[01:41:53.019 --> 01:41:55.421]  So it's looking pretty good for Trump.
[01:41:55.421 --> 01:41:57.503]  The approval rating keeps climbing.
[01:41:57.503 --> 01:42:00.847]  It's looking pretty good compared to this time last year, definitely.
[01:42:02.645 --> 01:42:03.726]  And that's incredible news.
[01:42:03.726 --> 01:42:06.749]  I saw that top UK betting sites that are almost never wrong.
[01:42:06.749 --> 01:42:09.732]  They say 2 to 1, they'll win the Nobel Prize.
[01:42:09.732 --> 01:42:10.633]  And just think about that.
[01:42:10.633 --> 01:42:11.654]  Trump says, I don't care about that.
[01:42:11.654 --> 01:42:14.196]  I care about the world winning.
[01:42:14.196 --> 01:42:16.278]  I care about victory for the planet.
[01:42:16.278 --> 01:42:18.380]  I mean, that is so exciting.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:19.421]  Their blue wave is dead.
[01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:21.663]  And remember, they add 15 points or more.
[01:42:21.663 --> 01:42:22.985]  CNN even more on those samples.
[01:42:23.365 --> 01:42:26.226]  So that means Trump's like way ahead, not dead heat.
[01:42:26.226 --> 01:42:29.327]  That means conservatives are way ahead, nationalists, populists.
[01:42:29.327 --> 01:42:32.469]  The pro-prosperity movement is way ahead, Paul.
[01:42:32.469 --> 01:42:33.649]  This is so exciting.
[01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:35.450]  They've got to be pulling their hair out.
[01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:40.672]  CNN famously would sample 36 points more of Democrats in their polls.
[01:42:40.672 --> 01:42:42.372]  Remember the New York Times said 98% chance.
[01:42:44.614 --> 01:42:49.681]  98% chance that Hillary was going to win until Election Day.
[01:42:49.681 --> 01:42:50.542]  They're a joke.
[01:42:50.542 --> 01:42:51.383]  They're a fraud.
[01:42:51.383 --> 01:42:52.345]  They're losers.
[01:42:52.345 --> 01:42:53.326]  They're scum.
[01:42:53.326 --> 01:42:56.711]  And all their money in the world isn't going to buy them control of this country.
[01:43:01.295 --> 01:43:07.017]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:43:07.017 --> 01:43:14.879]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:43:14.879 --> 01:43:18.040]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[01:44:59.544 --> 01:45:09.690]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:45:09.690 --> 01:45:15.194]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:45:15.194 --> 01:45:18.216]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:45:18.216 --> 01:45:27.002]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:45:29.083 --> 01:45:48.672]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:45:48.672 --> 01:45:51.334]  It is amazing!
[01:45:51.334 --> 01:45:56.316]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:45:58.462 --> 01:46:07.956]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:46:07.956 --> 01:46:12.664]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:46:12.664 --> 01:46:14.186]  It is produced by extracting oil.
[01:46:14.366 --> 01:46:17.428]  From healthy, nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[01:46:17.428 --> 01:46:20.470]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:22.891]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:46:22.891 --> 01:46:26.454]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:46:26.454 --> 01:46:30.336]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:46:30.336 --> 01:46:39.402]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:46:39.402 --> 01:46:41.343]  Read the facts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:41.923 --> 01:46:43.705]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:16.506 --> 01:47:28.474]  There's so much to get into, and I'm getting really amazing information here, dealing with what's happening in the White House, the President's surrounded.
[01:47:28.474 --> 01:47:33.358]  There are going to be massive attacks against Eric Prince in the next week.
[01:47:33.358 --> 01:47:34.178]  Not good.
[01:47:34.178 --> 01:47:37.861]  So-called QAnon asked, do you want to play a game?
[01:47:37.861 --> 01:47:38.482]  It's not a game.
[01:47:39.482 --> 01:47:47.246]  And then it just goes into the point being the White House Freedom Command, mainly Bolton, was the wedge there.
[01:47:47.246 --> 01:47:50.188]  Trump's surrounded, impossible job.
[01:47:50.188 --> 01:47:51.489]  That's from a real source.
[01:47:53.715 --> 01:47:57.217]  And all we're trying to do is turn the economy back on and we see the insanity.
[01:47:57.217 --> 01:47:59.538]  Paul, have you seen Maxine Waters?
[01:47:59.538 --> 01:48:01.479]  I want to play the longer clip now in context.
[01:48:01.479 --> 01:48:03.540]  Some people are like, oh, what was he saying?
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:04.400]  Must have really made her mad.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:07.782]  This congressman is talking about, we need to stop all this racism.
[01:48:07.782 --> 01:48:08.682]  We need jobs.
[01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:17.607]  When you're on a Detroit assembly line and you're a man or you're a woman or you're black or you're white, you know, you're just people all together and there's not a bunch of racism because there's not.
[01:48:18.943 --> 01:48:27.409]  And she flips out and says, I don't like this, make America great again stuff, and gets really, really rude.
[01:48:27.409 --> 01:48:33.593]  And the speaker does admonish the Republican for kind of looking her way and saying something to her.
[01:48:33.593 --> 01:48:35.834]  She's famous for yelling at everybody.
[01:48:35.834 --> 01:48:40.518]  And then she says that, oh, he's not admonishing the white guy.
[01:48:40.518 --> 01:48:42.539]  So have you seen this incredible footage, Paul?
[01:48:43.976 --> 01:48:49.742]  Yeah but I mean we should be celebrating this kind of footage because as I said before the break it's not working.
[01:48:49.742 --> 01:49:00.533]  They've lost 9% of millennial votes since 2016 specifically because they still are obsessed with this identity politics which doesn't translate into votes.
[01:49:00.533 --> 01:49:02.755]  Hillary Clinton's still talking about it.
[01:49:02.755 --> 01:49:04.817]  We should celebrate them still talking about it.
[01:49:04.817 --> 01:49:05.798]  You know Bernie Sanders
[01:49:07.088 --> 01:49:19.313]  The people from his school of thought, though we may disagree with it vehemently, they know, and Sanders has said it on several occasions in the past, they know this identity politics ticket is never a winning ticket.
[01:49:19.313 --> 01:49:29.637]  So we should be applauding this kind of speech, we should be applauding Hillary Clinton talking about it, because it doesn't work, it hasn't worked, and the polls show that it won't work in 2018 and in 2020.
[01:49:29.637 --> 01:49:30.477]  It's a losing game.
[01:49:34.844 --> 01:49:43.634]  Paul, I want to go ahead and play some of this because I want it to be in context when Maxine Waters goes completely crazy.
[01:49:43.634 --> 01:49:47.159]  She's talking to this congressman.
[01:49:47.159 --> 01:49:53.326]  And again, I basically paraphrased what he had to say, but I thought that we should actually have what he said in context.
[01:49:53.326 --> 01:49:54.527]  Representative Mike Kelly.
[01:49:56.573 --> 01:50:01.096]  And her bizarre response, Maxine Waters explodes on House floor.
[01:50:01.096 --> 01:50:02.757]  I resent making America great again.
[01:50:02.757 --> 01:50:04.838]  You cannot make up this type of statement.
[01:50:04.838 --> 01:50:05.758]  Here it is.
[01:50:05.758 --> 01:50:07.660]  Thank you very much for giving me some time.
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:11.762]  I know, I just heard the phrase that I am appalled by what's taking place on the floor today.
[01:50:11.762 --> 01:50:16.145]  I would tell you, I joined in those comments and I really do believe that.
[01:50:16.145 --> 01:50:23.589]  For a person whose family's been in the automobile business since 1953 and sold thousands and thousands of cars to people of any color,
[01:50:24.295 --> 01:50:27.218]  It doesn't matter the color of the person buying the car.
[01:50:27.218 --> 01:50:30.621]  Do we match them up with the transportation need that they were looking for?
[01:50:30.621 --> 01:50:33.885]  And were we able to arrange financing that was affordable to them?
[01:50:33.885 --> 01:50:37.949]  You cannot be in business for 65 years doing it the wrong way.
[01:50:37.949 --> 01:50:42.533]  And to impugn the integrity of the automobile people is absolutely beyond reproach.
[01:50:42.533 --> 01:50:46.057]  And so if you run out of facts, I guess the next thing you have to go to is discrimination.
[01:50:46.696 --> 01:50:49.797]  And when we talk this way, it is... Let's hit pause for a minute.
[01:50:49.797 --> 01:50:56.621]  In the context, the Democrats, as it is ours of this, have been complaining that people aren't giving black people car loans.
[01:50:56.621 --> 01:51:03.324]  If anything, the car dealers are predatory to everybody trying to get you to take as big a loan as possible.
[01:51:03.324 --> 01:51:04.844]  That's how they make their money.
[01:51:04.844 --> 01:51:08.326]  They don't like it when you come in and buy car cash.
[01:51:08.326 --> 01:51:09.607]  Again, and she knows that.
[01:51:09.607 --> 01:51:11.587]  She's filthy rich.
[01:51:11.587 --> 01:51:12.468]  Anyways, let's go back to it.
[01:51:13.513 --> 01:51:15.614]  Let's divide them, let's try to separate them.
[01:51:15.614 --> 01:51:18.536]  The color of the skin, the shape of their eye, their gender.
[01:51:18.536 --> 01:51:25.299]  Let's make sure that we can make every statement possible to show that there are bad people out there doing things to other folks.
[01:51:25.299 --> 01:51:28.881]  And it's only by discrimination that these things get done.
[01:51:28.881 --> 01:51:35.324]  I will tell you, I am greatly offended as a member of the automobile industry and as someone who has served thousands of people.
[01:51:35.324 --> 01:51:36.805]  If you think the dealers are that bad,
[01:51:37.185 --> 01:51:40.807]  Please go to your hometown and look at the little events and find out whose names out there.
[01:51:40.807 --> 01:51:44.848]  Look at your high school programs and see who it is that's funding all these things.
[01:51:44.848 --> 01:51:48.930]  Go to any charity and see who's on the list of who takes care of people.
[01:51:48.930 --> 01:51:58.494]  To sit here today and have to listen, that somehow this is discriminatory, just adds to the fact that when you're out of facts, when you don't know what you're talking about and what you've never done.
[01:51:59.094 --> 01:52:02.556]  Not one of your people have ever been on the floor and had tried.
[01:52:02.556 --> 01:52:03.577]  Not this floor.
[01:52:03.577 --> 01:52:05.518]  I'm talking about the automobile floor.
[01:52:05.518 --> 01:52:08.820]  You know an awful lot about laptops, but you know nothing about blacktop.
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:14.403]  You get on that floor, you get on that lot, and you work with people to make sure they can have affordable transportation.
[01:52:14.403 --> 01:52:16.445]  Affordable transportation!
[01:52:16.445 --> 01:52:20.787]  Rather than this person trying to arrange financing by himself or herself.
[01:52:20.787 --> 01:52:21.948]  We rely on a dealer.
[01:52:22.714 --> 01:52:30.778]  Who has great, great heft within the financial community and to talk to lenders and say, we have a great customer here who's looking to buy a car.
[01:52:30.778 --> 01:52:34.820]  We need you to work with us to get them in this transportation.
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:38.202]  How in the world can you reduce this down to discrimination?
[01:52:39.059 --> 01:52:41.643]  We are doing the same thing every day that you are doing.
[01:52:41.643 --> 01:52:45.689]  We are trying to make sure that we're making America great every day in every way.
[01:52:45.689 --> 01:52:50.576]  And the best way to do that is to stop talking about discrimination and start talking about the nation.
[01:52:50.576 --> 01:52:53.120]  We're coming together as a people in spite of what you say.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.302]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[01:52:54.302 --> 01:52:54.803]  I yield back.
[01:52:55.461 --> 01:52:57.202]  Gentlemen, time has expired.
[01:52:57.202 --> 01:52:59.764]  Members are reminded to address their remarks to the chair.
[01:52:59.764 --> 01:53:03.067]  The gentleman from Texas Reserves, gentlelady from California.
[01:53:03.067 --> 01:53:04.708]  Thank you very much.
[01:53:04.708 --> 01:53:15.016]  The gentleman, Mr. Kelly, please do not leave because I want you to know that I am more offended as an African-American woman than you will ever be.
[01:53:15.016 --> 01:53:19.740]  And this business about making America great again, it is your president- Pause again.
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:22.761]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:23.622]  Back in a few seconds.
[01:53:23.622 --> 01:53:27.147]  Lady, if America's so horrible, get the hell out.
[01:53:27.147 --> 01:53:30.551]  You've sent tens of millions of taxpayer money to your husband's bank.
[01:53:30.551 --> 01:53:32.453]  And you've gotten away with it because you're a woman.
[01:53:33.484 --> 01:53:35.724]  And because you sit there and you race bait everybody.
[01:53:35.724 --> 01:53:38.945]  You deserve to be in prison with Hillary Clinton, you wench!
[01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:42.066]  Now listen, she says, I don't like hearing about America being great.
[01:53:42.066 --> 01:53:43.146]  We get it!
[01:53:43.146 --> 01:53:44.266]  Here, here she is.
[01:53:44.266 --> 01:53:45.506]  ...will ever be.
[01:53:45.506 --> 01:53:51.427]  And this business about making America great again, it is your president that's dividing this country.
[01:53:51.427 --> 01:53:57.929]  And don't talk to me about the fact that we don't understand what happens on the... No, I will not yield.
[01:53:57.929 --> 01:53:58.829]  No, I will not yield.
[01:53:59.769 --> 01:54:01.610]  Don't tell me that we don't understand.
[01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:06.411]  That's the attitude that's been given toward women time and time again.
[01:54:06.411 --> 01:54:07.931]  The gentlelady will suspend.
[01:54:07.931 --> 01:54:13.633]  The chair wishes to remind all members that they are to address their remarks to the chair.
[01:54:13.633 --> 01:54:17.734]  I respect the chair, but don't stop me in the middle when you didn't stop him in the middle.
[01:54:17.734 --> 01:54:19.695]  And so I shall continue.
[01:54:19.695 --> 01:54:27.877]  Don't you dare talk to me like that and think that somehow women don't understand what goes on on the floor of automobile dealers.
[01:54:28.217 --> 01:54:33.399]  Minded to direct her remarks to the chair.
[01:54:33.399 --> 01:54:35.519]  I will continue to do that.
[01:54:35.519 --> 01:54:46.743]  However, I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him when he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more about discrimination than I know about discrimination.
[01:54:46.743 --> 01:54:51.204]  I resent that and I resent the remark about making America great again.
[01:54:51.204 --> 01:54:53.585]  He's down here making a speech for this dishonorable,
[01:54:54.305 --> 01:54:55.125]  That's enough.
[01:54:55.125 --> 01:54:57.406]  That's enough.
[01:54:57.406 --> 01:55:01.408]  I can't listen anymore.
[01:55:01.408 --> 01:55:10.071]  Paul, the guy, she's there earlier attacking the car dealerships that they won't give black people loans and all this made up stuff.
[01:55:10.071 --> 01:55:13.712]  If anything, they're trying to give everybody loans that some people can't afford, white or black.
[01:55:13.712 --> 01:55:14.672]  This is just crazy.
[01:55:14.672 --> 01:55:16.913]  Of course car dealers want to sell you stuff.
[01:55:16.913 --> 01:55:19.914]  And I mean, it's just, it's, they turn everything into racism, Paul.
[01:55:21.556 --> 01:55:23.657]  Well, this is a woman who's clearly losing it.
[01:55:23.657 --> 01:55:30.801]  Remember she said, what was it, that Putin was writing Trump's campaign slogans, like he wrote, lock her up and everything like that.
[01:55:30.801 --> 01:55:31.421]  Drain the swamp.
[01:55:31.421 --> 01:55:34.423]  Clearly losing, yeah, clearly losing it.
[01:55:34.423 --> 01:55:36.584]  But again, we should be celebrating it.
[01:55:36.864 --> 01:55:43.787]  Why do you think the viewership for the Academy Awards, for the Oscars, for the Grammys, why do you think the audience for the NFL is hemorrhaging?
[01:55:43.787 --> 01:55:46.949]  Because Americans hate this identity politics nonsense.
[01:55:46.949 --> 01:55:48.229]  You heard the clip there.
[01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:50.190]  Women this, African Americans that.
[01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:56.593]  You're not making any actual point, you're just dropping in buzzwords when you drill down into the polls.
[01:55:56.593 --> 01:55:57.754]  Americans hate this.
[01:55:57.754 --> 01:56:04.377]  This is turning them off entertainment, it's turning them off award shows, and it's turning them off democratic politics.
[01:56:04.677 --> 01:56:15.939]  Which is why they see Candace Owens and Kanye West as such a threat, because they're directly neutralizing this kind of messaging, and it's not resonating with people, Alex.
[01:56:15.939 --> 01:56:19.740]  Long term, Paul, what do you think they're going to do as they figure out this doesn't work?
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:25.141]  Because it's in the WikiLeaks, they say, we're going to use race war, culture war to control the people, but it's not working.
[01:56:25.141 --> 01:56:27.462]  It only works on a small group of morons.
[01:56:31.205 --> 01:56:32.546]  Carry on, I can't talk.
[01:56:49.266 --> 01:56:50.647]  And we have to play it when we come back.
[01:56:50.647 --> 01:56:53.629]  And then we've got a First Amendment lawyer in here in studio with us.
[01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:54.610]  Look forward to him being with us.
[01:56:54.610 --> 01:56:55.930]  We'll cover the waterfront.
[01:56:55.930 --> 01:56:58.932]  To these, just hundreds, this has been on NPR.
[01:56:58.932 --> 01:57:01.634]  It's been on, I'm told CNN aired this.
[01:57:01.634 --> 01:57:05.497]  It's been everywhere.
[01:57:05.497 --> 01:57:09.719]  That we were afraid of this woman and that I pulled a video.
[01:57:09.719 --> 01:57:11.120]  Nope.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:15.723]  They posted 30, 40, 50, I don't remember, more videos than I said on the main YouTube channel one day.
[01:57:15.723 --> 01:57:18.105]  And I said, listen, delete those, put them on the sub channel.
[01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:24.134]  And then when they saw that I deleted that day, it was like 20, 30 videos, I forget.
[01:57:24.134 --> 01:57:25.635]  Hadn't even looked at them.
[01:57:25.635 --> 01:57:27.656]  I just said, you gotta put them on the subchannels.
[01:57:27.656 --> 01:57:29.958]  They went, oh my God, he's scared.
[01:57:29.958 --> 01:57:32.239]  He's scared of this woman.
[01:57:32.239 --> 01:57:33.700]  She's so incredible.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.942]  And I finally this morning thought, man, I've been hearing about this for two weeks.
[01:57:36.942 --> 01:57:39.884]  I better watch what the video is that we supposedly deleted.
[01:57:39.884 --> 01:57:42.945]  So I went to our channel and watched it, one of the subchannels.
[01:57:42.945 --> 01:57:45.427]  And it's like this woman is dumbered in a box of rocks.
[01:57:48.533 --> 01:57:57.078]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWar to fight the globalists and live in a free society.

[01:58:48.038 --> 01:58:55.686]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:58:55.686 --> 01:59:03.615]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:59:03.615 --> 01:59:06.698]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:59:07.319 --> 01:59:11.961]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:59:11.961 --> 01:59:16.082]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:19.243]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:59:19.243 --> 01:59:24.005]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:59:24.005 --> 01:59:27.046]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:59:27.466 --> 01:59:42.551]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:59:42.551 --> 01:59:44.071]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:59:44.071 --> 01:59:51.874]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:59:51.874 --> 01:59:54.495]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.768 --> 02:00:10.430]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:15.553]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:17.259 --> 02:00:41.264]  So there's a tactic I've noticed, where the globalist media will take the stupidest person and make them an icon, knowing that their constituents are a lot of drooling, slobbering, rich kids, skinny jeans, $1,000, you know, smartphone in their hand, at South by Southwest, you know, $3,000 tickets, staying in palatial fancy hotels that are $500 a night to $1,000.
[02:00:41.264 --> 02:00:42.824]  So you've got rich millennials
[02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:49.580]  Always pulling up in their fancy cars, all posh.
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:55.185]  And then Paul introduced me to Ashton Witte, a young lady from California that he interviewed a few times.
[02:00:55.185 --> 02:00:56.285]  She was coming to town.
[02:00:56.285 --> 02:00:57.366]  She wanted to do some reporting.
[02:00:57.366 --> 02:00:58.987]  Well, we had a glut of reporting.
[02:00:58.987 --> 02:01:00.509]  We've got like 10 different YouTube channels.
[02:01:00.509 --> 02:01:04.492]  And I had said right around that time, don't flood the main channel with 30, 40 videos.
[02:01:04.492 --> 02:01:08.154]  So getting right to it, I come on there, there's like 20 videos of South by Southwest.
[02:01:08.154 --> 02:01:09.696]  And I said, they just been put up.
[02:01:09.696 --> 02:01:11.957]  I said, delete them, put them all on sub channels.
[02:01:11.957 --> 02:01:12.618]  I'll walk out of the room.
[02:01:14.153 --> 02:01:25.350]  A month later, this has been all over CNN, you name it, we're going to go to right now, Sailor Socialism, Dasha Nekrokhoza, if you pronounce it right, I don't know, explains her viral InfoWars interview.
[02:01:26.533 --> 02:01:31.236]  Here's Vice, the very chill woman who owned Infowars, is now an excellent meme.
[02:01:31.236 --> 02:01:34.418]  So they say, we took it down because she destroyed our reporter.
[02:01:34.418 --> 02:01:35.979]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:01:35.979 --> 02:01:44.144]  So I finally watch it, she's like, I like Bernie Sanders, I like socialism, I want everything free.
[02:01:47.306 --> 02:01:50.306]  I mean, you'd think I hired her, she's so stupid.
[02:01:50.306 --> 02:01:54.507]  Like the guy that dumped coffee on me, they thought I hired him because he was so stupid.
[02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:55.308]  No, that really happened.
[02:01:55.308 --> 02:01:55.868]  That guy's real.
[02:01:55.868 --> 02:01:57.248]  He really hates me.
[02:01:57.248 --> 02:02:01.429]  Anyway, so I'm going to play this video and then get Paul's take on it.
[02:02:01.429 --> 02:02:03.250]  But this is what they say I'm afraid of.
[02:02:03.250 --> 02:02:05.670]  I finally watch it this morning.
[02:02:05.670 --> 02:02:06.831]  I feel sorry for this woman.
[02:02:06.831 --> 02:02:07.471]  She's so stupid.
[02:02:07.471 --> 02:02:07.791]  Here it is.
[02:02:10.458 --> 02:02:11.098]  Hi!
[02:02:11.098 --> 02:02:12.859]  Are you a fan of Bernie Sanders?
[02:02:12.859 --> 02:02:13.760]  Yeah, I am.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:15.520]  What do you like about him?
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:17.161]  That he's a socialist.
[02:02:17.161 --> 02:02:23.324]  Why is socialism good?
[02:02:23.324 --> 02:02:25.045]  I don't really want to do this.
[02:02:25.045 --> 02:02:26.465]  What is this for?
[02:02:26.465 --> 02:02:27.926]  We're asking people why they like Bernie Sanders.
[02:02:29.406 --> 02:02:31.486]  For InfoWars?
[02:02:31.486 --> 02:02:32.647]  Yes, we are InfoWars.
[02:02:32.647 --> 02:02:34.547]  I think he has a lot of integrity.
[02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:35.927]  I like his value system.
[02:02:35.927 --> 02:02:37.328]  I like what he stands for.
[02:02:37.328 --> 02:02:39.748]  Exactly what value he stands for.
[02:02:39.748 --> 02:02:41.228]  Eating the rich.
[02:02:41.228 --> 02:02:41.849]  Eating the rich.
[02:02:41.849 --> 02:02:50.950]  Well, are you aware that Bernie Sanders lives in... She's taking a drink off her $5 latte while she looks at the expensive smartphone at a very expensive deal.
[02:02:50.950 --> 02:02:51.891]  And it just gets worse.
[02:02:51.891 --> 02:02:54.871]  I mean, and then they say, I'm afraid of this.
[02:02:54.871 --> 02:02:57.872]  I'm going to have this tattooed on my brain.
[02:02:57.872 --> 02:02:58.252]  Here it is.
[02:02:59.133 --> 02:03:03.594]  Well, are you aware that Bernie Sanders lives in $3 million homes?
[02:03:03.594 --> 02:03:04.775]  No, I was not aware of that.
[02:03:04.775 --> 02:03:05.855]  Yeah.
[02:03:05.855 --> 02:03:08.056]  And are you aware... I'm going to ask you something.
[02:03:08.056 --> 02:03:13.557]  So if they're about eating the rich, why do you think so many of the 1% support socialism?
[02:03:13.557 --> 02:03:15.058]  Is that true?
[02:03:15.058 --> 02:03:15.718]  It's very true.
[02:03:15.718 --> 02:03:16.638]  Like who?
[02:03:16.638 --> 02:03:18.979]  Well, for example, you know Venezuela, right?
[02:03:18.979 --> 02:03:19.579]  Heard of it.
[02:03:19.579 --> 02:03:25.041]  A majority of the country is currently eating rats while their politicians are drinking champagne on a daily basis.
[02:03:31.833 --> 02:03:32.594]  Check the phone.
[02:03:32.594 --> 02:03:33.874]  But that's not the 1%.
[02:03:33.874 --> 02:03:36.556]  The 1% of Venezuela.
[02:03:36.556 --> 02:03:38.076]  I'm talking about America.
[02:03:38.076 --> 02:03:39.697]  Well, I'm saying- Hit pause again.
[02:03:39.697 --> 02:03:44.480]  Say, America is the problem, continue.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.361]  Sanders were president, right?
[02:03:46.361 --> 02:03:51.043]  And he wanted to bring the same ideas for socialism into this country.
[02:03:51.043 --> 02:03:51.463]  Yeah.
[02:03:51.463 --> 02:03:53.905]  Do you think that we would benefit?
[02:03:53.905 --> 02:03:54.725]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:54.725 --> 02:03:56.446]  But I just told you Venezuela's getting rats.
[02:03:58.297 --> 02:04:00.478]  But I just want people to have health care, honey.
[02:04:00.478 --> 02:04:04.859]  I don't want, like... Well... Oh my God.
[02:04:04.859 --> 02:04:05.759]  Oh my God.
[02:04:05.759 --> 02:04:08.339]  People have, like, worms in your brain, honestly.
[02:04:08.339 --> 02:04:09.820]  They have, like, worms in their brain.
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:13.081]  I mean, you're the one who can't answer the question.
[02:04:13.081 --> 02:04:14.221]  What question?
[02:04:14.221 --> 02:04:15.421]  The question is, like... Pause.
[02:04:15.421 --> 02:04:18.602]  If you shot a bunch of school children, both these women, and said, who's got worms in their brain?
[02:04:23.854 --> 02:04:26.235]  I want it free there for here.
[02:04:26.235 --> 02:04:32.657]  We're going to come back and let Paul Watson finish up and then we've got Great First Amendment.
[02:04:32.657 --> 02:04:33.838]  I want everything free.
[02:04:35.078 --> 02:04:35.698]  I would have asked.
[02:04:35.698 --> 02:04:36.819]  Man, you got a nice smartphone.
[02:04:36.819 --> 02:04:37.739]  Man, you're here with $3,000.
[02:04:37.739 --> 02:04:38.579]  We're in Southwest.
[02:04:38.579 --> 02:04:41.320]  Where are you staying?
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:45.881]  If you don't like free market, go somewhere to a third-world hellhole, you dumb moron.
[02:04:45.881 --> 02:04:47.441]  But this is who they hold up.
[02:04:47.441 --> 02:04:52.142]  They teach you to worship the failure, like the CIA funding ugly art and ugly architecture.
[02:04:52.142 --> 02:04:53.123]  This woman's it.
[02:04:53.123 --> 02:04:54.583]  She's the symbol of ugliness.

[02:06:16.732 --> 02:06:18.593]  You know what I want to do?
[02:06:18.593 --> 02:06:21.194]  I want to get it finished.
[02:06:21.194 --> 02:06:23.335]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[02:06:39.126 --> 02:06:45.675]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:06:52.962 --> 02:06:57.545]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:06:57.545 --> 02:06:59.926]  I will not let you down.
[02:06:59.926 --> 02:07:03.929]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:03.929 --> 02:07:07.211]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:07:18.633 --> 02:07:21.374]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:21.374 --> 02:07:24.374]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:07:24.374 --> 02:07:26.655]  Good evening, everybody.
[02:07:26.655 --> 02:07:28.675]  There's not even the same universe.
[02:07:28.675 --> 02:07:32.256]  I mean, she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell.
[02:07:32.256 --> 02:07:40.318]  People around her say she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[02:07:40.318 --> 02:07:41.338]  They're freaking out.
[02:07:41.338 --> 02:07:45.779]  Folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:07:45.779 --> 02:07:47.559]  Whiskey bottle!
[02:07:51.105 --> 02:07:57.227]  What's different at this point, Doug, than me?
[02:07:57.227 --> 02:08:00.408]  I have two words for you.
[02:08:00.408 --> 02:08:02.168]  But you're drunk.
[02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:21.593]  There's a guy on the radio.
[02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:24.276]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[02:08:24.276 --> 02:08:26.219]  He said we smell like salt.
[02:08:26.219 --> 02:08:28.061]  Ain't that something?
[02:08:28.061 --> 02:08:30.104]  I'm not just being tacky.
[02:08:30.104 --> 02:08:32.908]  Call me Margaret Needham Samoa.
[02:08:32.908 --> 02:08:35.611]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like that.
[02:08:50.422 --> 02:08:55.466]  Sorry, I'm gonna sneeze.
[02:08:55.466 --> 02:09:00.110]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:09:00.110 --> 02:09:01.051]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:09:01.051 --> 02:09:02.572]  Can I get the bill?
[02:09:02.572 --> 02:09:05.514]  Just a minute.
[02:09:05.514 --> 02:09:07.236]  Just a minute.
[02:09:07.236 --> 02:09:08.437]  Come here.
[02:09:08.437 --> 02:09:17.064]  Don't move.
[02:09:17.064 --> 02:09:18.045]  There it is.
[02:09:19.866 --> 02:09:23.776]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[02:09:40.233 --> 02:09:41.235]  Well, you found it.
[02:09:41.235 --> 02:09:43.599]  This is where we're fighting for the Republic.
[02:09:43.599 --> 02:09:48.108]  We're trying to restore the country to its axis of renaissance.
[02:09:48.108 --> 02:09:49.871]  There it is, Daily Mail.
[02:09:49.871 --> 02:09:52.095]  They're all reporting it.
[02:09:52.095 --> 02:09:52.816]  UK Sharing.
[02:09:53.809 --> 02:09:58.576]  Hate posts online could lead to six months in jail under newly proposed rules.
[02:09:58.576 --> 02:10:07.247]  And then a liberal like Count Dankula, who makes comedy videos like Charlie Chaplin or John Cleese making fun of Hitler, had the dog howl Hitler.
[02:10:07.247 --> 02:10:10.952]  They're saying he's facing six months to over a year in prison.
[02:10:11.832 --> 02:10:17.195]  So this is real, and joining us for the rest of the hour is Mark John Randazza of Randazza.com.
[02:10:17.195 --> 02:10:20.916]  He's a very respected First Amendment lawyer out there across the country.
[02:10:20.916 --> 02:10:22.577]  I've asked a lot of people, hey, who's really good?
[02:10:22.577 --> 02:10:24.898]  They're like, well, Mark Balin, Mark Randazza.
[02:10:24.898 --> 02:10:29.721]  There's a lot of guys that are older than them that were also famous for that that are retired, but the law firm I've got...
[02:10:30.841 --> 02:10:31.322]  in D.C.
[02:10:31.322 --> 02:10:39.566]  represents the Bushes and people, but they're there representing me on a bunch of these, you know, fake things that are going on with the whole Sandy Hook deal.
[02:10:39.566 --> 02:10:40.607]  I'm not saying Sandy Hook's fake.
[02:10:40.607 --> 02:10:43.648]  I'm saying the fake lawsuit against me is filled with lies.
[02:10:43.648 --> 02:10:46.550]  And all the rest of it, but this is the whole lawfare situation.
[02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:47.751]  But we're finishing with Paul Watson.
[02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:48.811]  This all ties together.
[02:10:48.811 --> 02:10:58.197]  Paul, from the UK, what do you make of Vice and Kid Vogue and all of this Teen Vogue with this young woman
[02:10:58.857 --> 02:11:03.400]  Who looks like she's about 25, at South by Southwest, $3,000 ticket for the full ticket.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:07.843]  She's got a smartphone, she's got the most elite ticket you can get, according to her lanyard.
[02:11:07.843 --> 02:11:11.205]  She's got fancy clothes, all this stuff.
[02:11:11.205 --> 02:11:16.768]  She's with some, you know, rich-looking dude, all dandied out.
[02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:22.452]  And she's saying she wants socialism, but only for America, but knows nothing about Venezuela.
[02:11:22.452 --> 02:11:26.535]  Then they hold her up as this genius and say our reporter is a moron.
[02:11:27.515 --> 02:11:32.078]  And we're scared of this interview, and I finally watched it.
[02:11:32.078 --> 02:11:41.123]  Why do you think they take the most collapsed, stupid, moronic people, and we'll play some of her in a moment, so just play it from anywhere, she sounds like an idiot.
[02:11:41.123 --> 02:11:41.924]  What is this tactic?
[02:11:41.924 --> 02:11:48.127]  Like the CIA putting up ugly architecture, ugly art, to like make ugly or stupid the new avant-garde?
[02:11:48.127 --> 02:11:49.028]  What is this, Paul?
[02:11:49.028 --> 02:11:49.788]  What is this tactic?
[02:11:49.788 --> 02:11:50.689]  How do we quantify this?
[02:11:52.148 --> 02:11:53.990]  Well, you could say the left can't meme.
[02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:59.555]  I mean, if this is their big hero, this is a woman who gave an interview saying capitalism is evil.
[02:11:59.555 --> 02:12:01.496]  She's got her head buried in an iPhone.
[02:12:01.496 --> 02:12:06.981]  I don't see Venezuela, I don't see North Korea producing many iPhones, Alex.
[02:12:06.981 --> 02:12:08.923]  I mean, she's being given a platform by Vice.
[02:12:08.923 --> 02:12:14.088]  They love her, they've done like three articles about her, calling her an extremely chill woman.
[02:12:14.668 --> 02:12:23.815]  In other words, meaning an apathetic dumbo moron who can barely talk, who responds to the question about Venezuela by saying, heard of it?
[02:12:23.815 --> 02:12:24.736]  Heard of it?
[02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:31.661]  This is their big hero, a drooling idiot who can barely talk, who has no arguments, who is a complete hypocrite.
[02:12:31.661 --> 02:12:34.223]  Of course, Vice.com gives her a platform.
[02:12:34.223 --> 02:12:37.286]  They give a platform to some very interesting other people.
[02:12:38.061 --> 02:12:42.442]  Todd Nickerson, the admitted paedophile, he's still on Vice.com.
[02:12:42.442 --> 02:12:48.544]  Remember, Salon.com reported on him, gave him a platform, gave him several articles, deleted the articles out of shame.
[02:12:48.544 --> 02:12:50.125]  He's still on Vice.com.
[02:12:50.125 --> 02:12:51.565]  They've got no standards.
[02:12:51.565 --> 02:13:04.809]  They've literally taken a drooling idiot who knows nothing about socialism, who knows nothing about the fact that to fund government programs like healthcare, you need a creator class.
[02:13:05.521 --> 02:13:08.962]  You need wealth at the top, otherwise it doesn't get paid for.
[02:13:08.962 --> 02:13:13.523]  It collapses, literally, into people eating zoo animals and rats.
[02:13:13.523 --> 02:13:15.404]  They're like, oh my God, she said they're eating rats.
[02:13:15.404 --> 02:13:17.164]  They are eating rats!
[02:13:17.164 --> 02:13:17.404]  Right?
[02:13:17.404 --> 02:13:19.345]  Can you do a Google search?
[02:13:19.345 --> 02:13:21.066]  Venezuela's collapsing.
[02:13:21.066 --> 02:13:25.687]  Their currency's worth less than video game currencies at this point.
[02:13:25.687 --> 02:13:27.908]  This is the endgame of socialism.
[02:13:27.908 --> 02:13:31.008]  It's killed millions of people throughout history.
[02:13:31.008 --> 02:13:32.829]  Oh, but this is cool and trendy now.
[02:13:33.587 --> 02:13:41.372]  Because this idiot drooler, who can barely talk, says some chill things in response to actual questions.
[02:13:41.372 --> 02:13:45.495]  If this is the best they can do, then they're struggling big time.
[02:13:45.495 --> 02:13:51.258]  Now Tommy Robinson, they want to put him in jail, they've been talking about it under this new UK regulation, not even law.
[02:13:52.259 --> 02:13:58.646]  Paul, in closing, for saying 88% of rapes are Muslims.
[02:13:58.646 --> 02:14:00.007]  Well, I mean, that's in the statistics.
[02:14:00.007 --> 02:14:08.457]  But hey, all they've got to do is do what Finland's done now, and a few other countries where their high court has ruled that they're allowed to rape children.
[02:14:08.957 --> 02:14:13.904]  So a 20-year-old can rape a 10-year-old and it's not rape because that's the Muslim culture.
[02:14:13.904 --> 02:14:16.949]  So we have literal rape culture from Islam being defended.
[02:14:16.949 --> 02:14:22.357]  Meanwhile, they put up a statue in Florida of the famous sailor kissing the nurse and she said she liked it.
[02:14:22.357 --> 02:14:24.039]  By the way, he did it in front of his wife, the sailor did.
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:25.221]  I don't know.
[02:14:40.052 --> 02:14:46.042]  Family members, including your brothers, your sisters, and everybody, and the people that lived, you know, yeah, there was an orgy when everybody got back.
[02:14:46.042 --> 02:14:47.143]  Sorry, that's how it works.
[02:14:47.143 --> 02:14:49.046]  That's not rape, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:49.046 --> 02:14:50.769]  But let's look at some of these rape photos.
[02:14:50.769 --> 02:14:54.575]  They're so powerful vintage photos of soldiers kissing their loved ones.
[02:14:55.276 --> 02:14:57.838]  Look how evil this is, that man and woman loving each other.
[02:14:57.838 --> 02:14:59.119]  This has got to stop.
[02:14:59.119 --> 02:15:00.760]  This celebration is so horrible.
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:02.141]  This is so evil, Paul.
[02:15:02.141 --> 02:15:03.762]  Look, look, look more.
[02:15:03.762 --> 02:15:05.743]  Again, viewer discretion advised nowadays.
[02:15:05.743 --> 02:15:09.045]  These photos are just absolutely terrible.
[02:15:09.045 --> 02:15:11.547]  Nothing like beating Hitler to drop the panties.
[02:15:11.547 --> 02:15:13.948]  I mean, that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:13.948 --> 02:15:18.251]  But on Twitter, they compared me to Hitler for tweeting some of these out, Paul.
[02:15:18.251 --> 02:15:19.552]  Closing comments on that, my friend.
[02:15:20.902 --> 02:15:35.371]  Well, I mean, we had a situation in Britain where they banned a beach body ad of a toned, fit, athletic woman because it was body shaming and replaced it with these three obese land whales who are going to, unfortunately for them, have premature deaths.
[02:15:35.371 --> 02:15:37.892]  This is the complete reversal of sanity.
[02:15:37.892 --> 02:15:39.393]  This is anti-woman.
[02:15:39.393 --> 02:15:41.235]  This is anti-human.
[02:15:41.235 --> 02:15:46.458]  Everything they do is an absolute despicable reversal of logic inflicted upon us.
[02:15:46.458 --> 02:15:48.099]  What can we expect at this point?
[02:15:48.099 --> 02:15:49.320]  It's absolutely incredible.
[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:54.002]  Well, in every culture, when you lose millions of people, there's a baby boom right after.
[02:15:54.002 --> 02:15:55.522]  That's called instincts.
[02:15:55.522 --> 02:15:56.283]  We just lost a bunch of our people.
[02:15:56.283 --> 02:15:57.623]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:15:57.623 --> 02:16:04.526]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:16:04.526 --> 02:16:12.870]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:18.552]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:16:18.752 --> 02:16:20.553]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:16:20.553 --> 02:16:22.815]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:16:22.815 --> 02:16:27.218]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:16:27.218 --> 02:16:29.419]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:16:29.419 --> 02:16:37.144]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:16:54.827 --> 02:16:55.727]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:16:55.727 --> 02:16:58.128]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:16:58.128 --> 02:17:06.250]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:08.191]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:26.237]  You have been lied to.
[02:17:26.237 --> 02:17:28.699]  My name is Kevin Shipp.
[02:17:28.699 --> 02:17:31.400]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:36.724]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.
[02:17:36.724 --> 02:17:42.408]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:17:42.408 --> 02:17:45.850]  We gotta get this out because just because you're a white folks doesn't mean other people are.
[02:17:45.850 --> 02:17:48.972]  This is critical to get, to read, to give to the library, to give to the church.
[02:17:48.972 --> 02:17:53.135]  Get them right now at KillingUncleSamBook.com KillingUncleSamBook.com

[02:18:02.135 --> 02:18:03.016]  It'd take hours.
[02:18:03.016 --> 02:18:05.458]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[02:18:05.458 --> 02:18:06.619]  It's stronger.
[02:18:06.619 --> 02:18:08.241]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:18:08.241 --> 02:18:11.464]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:18:11.464 --> 02:18:12.585]  It's back in stock.
[02:18:12.585 --> 02:18:15.768]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:18:15.768 --> 02:18:19.091]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:19.651]  I think?
[02:18:37.618 --> 02:18:40.259]  Super high-quality silver and a lot more.
[02:18:40.259 --> 02:18:41.640]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:51.564]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:18:51.564 --> 02:18:54.606]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.

[02:20:10.498 --> 02:20:29.523]  Alright, I couldn't think of a better time to have Mark Randazza, a leading First Amendment lawyer, here in studio with us.
[02:20:29.523 --> 02:20:33.604]  I'm not having my lawyers on about particular defamation cases against me.
[02:20:34.424 --> 02:20:34.764]  I don't know.
[02:20:58.321 --> 02:21:01.162]  about Count Dankula, who's a comedy guy.
[02:21:01.162 --> 02:21:06.604]  Again, John Cleese, all the other famous comics, did their Hitler jokes.
[02:21:06.604 --> 02:21:15.608]  They've had Sarah Silverman do the Hitler jokes on late night TV, but he did a Hitler joke, and he's been convicted and is facing up to a year in prison for having his pug, Heil Hitler.
[02:21:16.889 --> 02:21:18.070]  Which is absurd.
[02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:24.512]  I mean, this guy had a, his girlfriend has a little pug dog that she squeals all the time about how cute it is.
[02:21:24.512 --> 02:21:29.595]  It annoys him, so he decides he's gonna do something funny and teach it how to do a Nazi salute.
[02:21:29.595 --> 02:21:30.475]  A dirty trick, yeah.
[02:21:30.475 --> 02:21:35.797]  Yeah, I mean, you gotta admit, in the scheme of, like, trolling your girlfriend, it's somewhat brilliant.
[02:21:35.797 --> 02:21:37.558]  My wife pied me this morning.
[02:21:37.558 --> 02:21:38.739]  She wasn't mad at me.
[02:21:38.739 --> 02:21:40.579]  She just slammed a key lime pie into my face.
[02:21:42.932 --> 02:21:45.614]  I mean, something else to my clients, but okay.
[02:21:45.614 --> 02:21:51.778]  Yeah, anyway, this is just a, it's just, you know, messing with his girlfriend and they decide that this is a hate crime?
[02:21:51.778 --> 02:21:52.119]  Why?
[02:21:52.119 --> 02:22:07.370]  I mean, it's just, it's absurd, but it is this view, you know, this idea that bothers, that really, you know, it bothers me when one side of a debate decides that it can't win in the marketplace of ideas, so it just says it's going to try to win through suppression of those ideas.
[02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.930]  Even jokes about it.
[02:22:08.930 --> 02:22:11.091]  I mean, this is nothing but a joke.
[02:22:11.091 --> 02:22:12.711]  Any idiot could see that.
[02:22:12.711 --> 02:22:21.753]  And for the prosecutor to even bring the case, much less for the court to convict him, is a travesty in a country that's supposed to be a democratic society.
[02:22:21.753 --> 02:22:24.693]  And here's the thing, this is mechanized, it's organized, it's moving.
[02:22:24.693 --> 02:22:28.614]  And just to be clear, I wouldn't pick the weights up in the garage because I use that as a gym.
[02:22:28.614 --> 02:22:30.674]  And it became a joke for days that I wouldn't pick them up.
[02:22:30.674 --> 02:22:32.134]  And I said, she's not my mommy.
[02:22:32.134 --> 02:22:34.795]  And then I'd asked her to get me a key lime pie like a week ago.
[02:22:35.495 --> 02:22:37.036]  But I didn't ever eat it.
[02:22:37.036 --> 02:22:38.756]  It was a friendly joke, but she did pie me.
[02:22:38.756 --> 02:22:43.078]  While I was laying there doing flies, all of a sudden my wife goes, bam, key lime pie.
[02:22:43.078 --> 02:22:43.738]  It was kind of fun.
[02:22:43.738 --> 02:22:47.420]  Well, if she had put a swastika on the pie, you could charge her with a hate crime, I suppose.
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:48.420]  Absolutely.
[02:22:48.420 --> 02:22:54.322]  So he's flirting with his girlfriend, messing with her, plus he got millions of views, he made money off of it, he's a comic.
[02:22:54.322 --> 02:22:58.964]  How can Charlie Chaplin do it, or how can John Cleese do it, but this guy can't do it?
[02:22:59.284 --> 02:23:01.446]  You know, I don't think it has anything to do with what the guy is.
[02:23:01.446 --> 02:23:09.413]  I think it has to do with, you know, people who want censorship are going to try to push the envelope at every opportunity.
[02:23:09.413 --> 02:23:16.699]  And, you know, right now it happens to be that this is much more the purview of the left, at least in the West.
[02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:25.863]  That wasn't always the case, and you know, heck, I've got shoes that have been around longer than it's been a liberal value to be in favor of censorship.
[02:23:25.863 --> 02:23:27.884]  How did they completely flip since Trump got elected?
[02:23:27.884 --> 02:23:30.644]  They're now, we want to end it, it's evil, get rid of it.
[02:23:30.644 --> 02:23:38.767]  Because so few people are committed to neutral civil liberties, and they're more committed to tribe, so they decide if they can use censorship to further their views.
[02:23:38.767 --> 02:23:46.810]  I mean, heck, I remember back in the Bush administration, you know, his entire Justice Department was devoted to trying shutting down pornography, because they're rappers.
[02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:51.412]  Yeah, and before that, you had Pippa Gore, my God, Al Gore's wife.
[02:23:51.412 --> 02:23:55.794]  And the left was all freaked out about it, but I mean now, here's why they're doing it.
[02:23:55.794 --> 02:24:01.737]  The left, before, was making money out of Hollywood and all the smut and the porn and the rest of it, they wanted to break down society.
[02:24:01.737 --> 02:24:04.918]  I'm not saying censor people, but I have my comment on what they were doing.
[02:24:04.918 --> 02:24:10.781]  Now they have the tools of social media and big tech, so now that they have the Ring of Mordor, they're putting it on.
[02:24:11.081 --> 02:24:12.362]  I agree.
[02:24:12.362 --> 02:24:26.176]  You see this with people on the right being systematically no-platformed, not just from media sites, but from YouTube, from Facebook, from Twitter, and now from PayPal and Stripe.
[02:24:26.176 --> 02:24:31.621]  If any company decides that it doesn't like the kind of thing you have to say, you're off.
[02:24:33.210 --> 02:24:37.152]  And that's exactly what Mark Balaam was telling me yesterday, my lawyer on this.
[02:24:37.152 --> 02:24:40.995]  He said, no, they're building towards a total no platforming where you're going to be in a ghetto.
[02:24:40.995 --> 02:24:42.255]  Just like the Nazis did.
[02:24:42.255 --> 02:24:43.796]  They're going to kick you off everything.
[02:24:43.796 --> 02:24:45.938]  They're going to try to bankrupt you, which they admit they're trying to do.
[02:24:45.938 --> 02:24:50.400]  Yeah, I mean, look, from a legal standpoint, I have to admit they have a legal right to do that.
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:51.421]  They can decide.
[02:24:51.421 --> 02:24:52.521]  They don't want them on here.
[02:24:52.521 --> 02:24:56.764]  You can decide, you know, you don't like what I have to say and go to a break and kick me out of here.
[02:24:57.304 --> 02:25:11.494]  But, when you invite that kind of one-sided debate, when you invite that kind of suppression of views that you don't like, you're doing something that is just not in any way healthy for a free society.
[02:25:11.494 --> 02:25:11.954]  Sure.
[02:25:11.954 --> 02:25:13.355]  Mark, I don't know if I totally agree with you.
[02:25:13.355 --> 02:25:17.478]  You know, if a gay couple gets a half million dollars because a Christian didn't want to bake their cake,
[02:25:18.859 --> 02:25:19.399]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:25:19.399 --> 02:25:22.702]  I say, hey, bake their cake, but hey, $500,000, come on, give me a break.
[02:25:22.702 --> 02:25:30.689]  But we're getting to the point where conservatives and libertarians are being discriminated against about being able to enter marketplaces.
[02:25:30.689 --> 02:25:31.971]  That's very discriminatory.
[02:25:31.971 --> 02:25:34.813]  I mean, if we said we're not going to let, you know,
[02:25:35.834 --> 02:25:36.715]  I don't think so.
[02:25:54.221 --> 02:25:55.262]  It's going to go tit for tat.
[02:25:55.262 --> 02:25:56.082]  I mean, take Amazon.
[02:25:56.082 --> 02:26:02.205]  They're not letting Christians use the platform for their whole program of charity.
[02:26:02.205 --> 02:26:04.246]  And so Christians need to boycott that.
[02:26:04.246 --> 02:26:10.229]  Look, that's, you know, they may, when it comes to racial discrimination, we do have laws that are clearly against that.
[02:26:10.229 --> 02:26:16.573]  When it comes to political discrimination, there are some laws in California, for example, the Unruh Act has been interpreted to prohibit that.
[02:26:17.433 --> 02:26:21.014]  But that's really not a slam-dunk theory.
[02:26:21.014 --> 02:26:24.355]  It's one that I'm trying to push in some cases.
[02:26:24.355 --> 02:26:30.197]  But you're right that if we don't look at it just so much as a legal issue, but as a normative issue, you're right.
[02:26:30.197 --> 02:26:33.598]  At some point, this kind of speech doesn't go away.
[02:26:34.218 --> 02:26:36.100]  Where it goes is it goes underground.
[02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:41.486]  People will find a way to organize, reorganize, and then I think you're going to find it even more scary.
[02:26:41.486 --> 02:26:52.959]  I mean, the thing is, nothing has given, I think, the extreme, extreme right, the neo-Nazis, nothing's given them more credibility and more strength than the efforts to shut them down.
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:27:04.667]  I mean, in the past, when you'd have a neo-Nazi march, a bunch of people would stand around, point at them and laugh, and it would be a ridiculous spectacle of five or six guys, you know, trying to cosplay Nazis.
[02:27:04.667 --> 02:27:07.409]  And everybody would laugh at them, and no one would take them seriously.
[02:27:07.409 --> 02:27:15.475]  But now, when you have this organized effort to commit violence against them, to try to take them down off of, you know, off of any means of expression,
[02:27:16.195 --> 02:27:19.438]  Well, then you wind up giving them just that little bit of martyrdom.
[02:27:19.438 --> 02:27:23.001]  You give them that little bit, that edge of, now they're the rebels.
[02:27:23.001 --> 02:27:30.589]  I was about to say, Ortega Info Wars, where Megyn Kelly edits tape of me saying that Hillary killed children in a basement.
[02:27:30.589 --> 02:27:32.911]  And I was talking about Hillary funding the Arab Spring.
[02:27:32.911 --> 02:27:34.192]  It's in the same clip.
[02:27:34.192 --> 02:27:35.673]  She just edited it and then played it.
[02:27:36.694 --> 02:27:43.560]  That's the defamation, that's the disinformation, that's the attack, and then they use that to try to de-platform us.
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:46.563]  That's going to cause a major Streisand effect for InfoWars.
[02:27:46.563 --> 02:27:47.403]  Perhaps, yeah.
[02:27:47.403 --> 02:27:54.870]  I mean, look, there was a time when I remember the internet companies just wouldn't listen to anything resembling censorship.
[02:27:55.370 --> 02:28:04.217]  The whole mantra in Silicon Valley was that, you know, we are the free speech wing of the free speech movement and, you know, we're going to let the marketplace of ideas decide.
[02:28:04.217 --> 02:28:06.518]  But that's when they were getting total dominance over the web.
[02:28:06.518 --> 02:28:10.001]  Now that they've got 90 plus percent total control, they are the internet.
[02:28:10.001 --> 02:28:17.366]  Now that the internet has been privatized to these multinational groups, Google's bigger than most governments, they're now rolling up the trap.
[02:28:17.366 --> 02:28:19.368]  And they're not accountable.
[02:28:19.368 --> 02:28:23.451]  And, you know, what really bothers me is that it's almost like it's an experiment.
[02:28:23.951 --> 02:28:26.232]  Let's see if we can do it to the far right.
[02:28:26.232 --> 02:28:28.193]  Let's see if we can do it to Klansmen and Nazis.
[02:28:28.193 --> 02:28:30.573]  Because if you can do it to them, you can do it to anybody.
[02:28:30.573 --> 02:28:31.734]  That's how it was in Nazi Germany.
[02:28:31.734 --> 02:28:33.395]  First they went for this group, then that group.
[02:28:33.395 --> 02:28:34.675]  That's how authoritarians always work.
[02:28:34.675 --> 02:28:35.375]  It's a formula.
[02:28:35.375 --> 02:28:36.376]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:28:36.376 --> 02:28:37.156]  Mark Randazzo, stay the word.
[02:28:37.156 --> 02:28:39.157]  Coming back, I want to talk about solutions.
[02:28:39.157 --> 02:28:40.937]  What do we do to turn the tide and defeat this?
[02:28:40.937 --> 02:28:43.058]  Because the censorship is here.
[02:28:43.058 --> 02:28:46.079]  Europe already arrests you if you say, hey, a Muslim raped a little girl.
[02:28:46.079 --> 02:28:47.080]  You're arrested.
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:48.200]  England's now putting that in.
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:49.620]  It's coming here next.
[02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:50.701]  This is draconian.
[02:28:55.828 --> 02:29:00.892]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[02:29:59.882 --> 02:30:01.662]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:30:01.662 --> 02:30:13.828]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:13.828 --> 02:30:18.730]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[02:30:19.490 --> 02:30:28.860]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:33.425]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:36.548 --> 02:30:38.290]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:38.290 --> 02:30:48.279]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:48.279 --> 02:30:50.922]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:30:50.922 --> 02:30:55.647]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[02:32:59.353 --> 02:33:01.995]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.694 --> 02:33:28.737]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:28.737 --> 02:33:36.323]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.323 --> 02:33:47.351]  I was talking to Mark Randazza during the break and he dropped a bombshell on me and I just pulled up a news article here.
[02:33:47.351 --> 02:33:48.972]  The American Bar Association
[02:33:50.504 --> 02:33:57.887]  ...is saying that if you make politically incorrect statements, according to their definition, you will be disbarred, not just in the practice of law, but in your own life.
[02:33:57.887 --> 02:33:59.207]  That is an end of the First Amendment.
[02:33:59.207 --> 02:34:10.111]  This is a clear assault by the big corporations, the institutions, the tech giants, the old media that's falling apart, the old political guard, to absolutely bully everyone into submission.
[02:34:11.212 --> 02:34:13.713]  And Mark, I didn't even know about this.
[02:34:13.713 --> 02:34:17.034]  I mean, this is just incredible that this is happening.
[02:34:17.034 --> 02:34:22.696]  And you were saying when you take a political test, you're right smack dab in the middle of the liberal column.
[02:34:22.696 --> 02:34:24.197]  And I've known about you for years.
[02:34:24.197 --> 02:34:24.997]  I know that.
[02:34:24.997 --> 02:34:26.798]  But you're a First Amendment guy.
[02:34:26.798 --> 02:34:29.159]  And all these lawyers I know, liberal and conservative,
[02:34:29.759 --> 02:34:30.139]  I don't
[02:34:50.117 --> 02:34:53.819]  Mankind or humankind, you know, out of the National Anthem of Canada.
[02:34:53.819 --> 02:34:57.240]  They're taking mother and father off the forums because that's a hurtful word.
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:03.923]  I mean, is there any end as the scourge of the political correctness and authoritarianism of the universities?
[02:35:03.923 --> 02:35:10.406]  Like, like, like, uh, diseased tumors busting open and metastasizing.
[02:35:10.746 --> 02:35:13.548]  Look, it's a requirement of orthodoxy.
[02:35:13.548 --> 02:35:16.189]  And that's one thing, I've never liked orthodoxy.
[02:35:16.189 --> 02:35:23.373]  You know, the fact that I do seem to be, you know, if I plot myself, yeah I do wind up right smack in the center of the liberal field.
[02:35:23.373 --> 02:35:26.435]  And the allure of the old left was that it wasn't orthodoxy.
[02:35:26.897 --> 02:35:29.419]  No, it had room for debate.
[02:35:29.419 --> 02:35:40.730]  There was a time when communism was something that we wanted to suppress here, and it was the old liberals that said, wait a minute, there's room for the philosophy that killed 90 million people.
[02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:46.315]  There's room for the philosophy of Stalin and Mao in our society.
[02:35:46.315 --> 02:35:51.440]  There's room for that because the marketplace of ideas will discredit it, and to the extent it doesn't,
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:58.343]  I mean, heck, even they might have one tiny shred of something that might be true that we take out and use as our own and get rid of the rest.
[02:35:58.343 --> 02:36:02.224]  But that's just not how people want it now.
[02:36:02.224 --> 02:36:03.485]  And that's what troubles me.
[02:36:03.485 --> 02:36:15.989]  You know, when you talked about this ABA rule, the American Bar Association has been trying to push this rule 8.4G, which would require lawyers to always be politically correct.
[02:36:15.989 --> 02:36:19.451]  I mean, I could go into more than... That would turn it into a full-bore cult.
[02:36:20.091 --> 02:36:22.332]  Yeah, I mean, I could bore the hell out of your viewers with the legality of it.
[02:36:22.332 --> 02:36:23.173]  No, this is huge!
[02:36:23.173 --> 02:36:34.959]  This is one of the biggest guilds, biggest professional groups in the country, one of the most powerful things in the world, and they're saying, you will adhere to whatever our new doctrine is.
[02:36:35.279 --> 02:36:38.923]  And not only in the practice of law, but anything connected to it.
[02:36:38.923 --> 02:36:42.286]  So for example, I'm on your show right now, and I'm a lawyer.
[02:36:42.286 --> 02:36:44.268]  This is connected to the practice of law.
[02:36:44.268 --> 02:36:46.070]  Oh, you're going to be criticized for coming on.
[02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:47.131]  Oh yeah, that's already happened.
[02:36:47.131 --> 02:36:50.794]  But I'm also pretty sure you're not winning the Political Correctness Award this year.
[02:36:50.794 --> 02:36:55.339]  You know, I could be disciplined under 8.4G if any of the bars that I was a member of had adopted it.
[02:36:55.899 --> 02:37:07.985]  Fortunately to this day, so far I believe only Vermont has adopted it, which is a little strange, but Montana and Tennessee rejected it, Nevada's taken it off the table, so people are pushing back.
[02:37:07.985 --> 02:37:11.246]  It's not as terrifying because lawyers are looking at this.
[02:37:11.246 --> 02:37:16.409]  Arizona's currently considering it, so if you're a lawyer in Arizona and you want freedom of expression...
[02:37:17.589 --> 02:37:30.340]  To quote Churchill, guys try to pull up Churchill's Iron Curtain speech, there is an Iron Curtain descending down now across Eastern Europe, and the evil Soviet Empire is expanding, and they are destroying free speech and censoring.
[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.462]  I mean, this is an Iron Curtain descending.
[02:37:32.782 --> 02:37:37.445]  You know, it's almost too bad that the Iron Curtain fell, I've said sometimes.
[02:37:37.445 --> 02:37:41.849]  Because it gave us at least this negative example of what we did.
[02:37:41.849 --> 02:37:43.250]  Exactly, don't be like that!
[02:37:43.250 --> 02:37:44.591]  Because now we're becoming that.
[02:37:44.591 --> 02:37:48.674]  Yeah, because it was one party rule, one way of thought.
[02:37:48.674 --> 02:37:51.676]  You know, yeah, you could be a dissident in East Germany.
[02:37:51.676 --> 02:37:52.597]  You could do that.
[02:37:52.597 --> 02:37:55.719]  You wouldn't get ahead, you wouldn't get into colleges, you wouldn't get the jobs you wanted.
[02:37:55.919 --> 02:37:57.981]  And that's the new system they're setting up here.
[02:37:57.981 --> 02:37:58.222]  Right.
[02:37:58.222 --> 02:38:01.866]  And we, you know, when you think about, just think about like communist East Germany.
[02:38:01.866 --> 02:38:03.768]  In America, we're going to live like, sorry, go ahead.
[02:38:03.768 --> 02:38:08.113]  But also, you know, at the time we also said we didn't, we wanted to fight.
[02:38:08.113 --> 02:38:11.057]  We put everything against that because we wanted this freedom of thought.
[02:38:11.057 --> 02:38:14.461]  We wanted this freedom of expression and we didn't want to live in a surveillance state.
[02:38:15.842 --> 02:38:24.205]  We've voluntarily given so much more surveillance power to the 650 area code than we ever would have tolerated.
[02:38:24.205 --> 02:38:31.648]  The Stasi would drool over what we've given to Silicon Valley as far as surveillance powers.
[02:38:31.648 --> 02:38:36.070]  And now we've also got that coalescing into a way to suppress political thought.
[02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:42.893]  And are we surprised that Germany three years ago began hiring senior former Stasi to run Facebook
[02:38:43.553 --> 02:38:45.855]  Censorship program and to call the police.
[02:38:45.855 --> 02:38:48.397]  No, not at all.
[02:38:48.397 --> 02:38:54.122]  I think the Stasi would be absolutely at home in Silicon Valley today.
[02:38:54.122 --> 02:38:58.926]  Well, when we talk about England, as has already happened in Europe, if you criticize Islam or gays,
[02:39:01.033 --> 02:39:04.054]  He was six months in jail, and now it's happening.
[02:39:04.054 --> 02:39:06.234]  Sure.
[02:39:06.234 --> 02:39:12.896]  But I say, even if that criticism is unfair, even if that criticism is wrong, mean, bigoted, so what?
[02:39:12.896 --> 02:39:19.758]  Because are those ideas, are these bigoted ideas so scary to these people that they can't stand in opposition?
[02:39:19.758 --> 02:39:21.518]  But it's even worse.
[02:39:21.518 --> 02:39:22.858]  It always only expands.
[02:39:22.858 --> 02:39:25.099]  They're just setting the precedent with what sounds popular.
[02:39:26.199 --> 02:39:27.521]  Oh, let's ban the Nazis.
[02:39:27.521 --> 02:39:29.402]  Next, it's, oh, we're going to fire this police chief.
[02:39:29.402 --> 02:39:35.248]  He reported that 92% of the rapes in Stockholm are for Muslims.
[02:39:35.248 --> 02:39:39.392]  I mean, and of course, like you said during the break, first is we can hit Richard Spencer in the head.
[02:39:39.392 --> 02:39:40.914]  I don't like Richard Spencer, but no, don't.
[02:39:40.914 --> 02:39:42.235]  But next, hit anybody you want in the head.
[02:39:42.495 --> 02:39:48.320]  Well, it's, yeah, it's, you know, first it's everybody thought it was funny when you said, hey, it's okay to punch a Nazi.
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:51.343]  And then it becomes, yeah, you see it right there on the screen.
[02:39:51.343 --> 02:39:52.204]  Now that's okay.
[02:39:52.204 --> 02:39:52.584]  Why?
[02:39:52.584 --> 02:39:54.646]  Because you disagree with his politics?
[02:39:54.646 --> 02:40:00.572]  You cross that speech violence divide and you are the one firing the first shot.
[02:40:00.572 --> 02:40:02.513]  And then what would happen if Spencer knew how to fight?
[02:40:03.254 --> 02:40:05.595]  And then he broke that guy's neck.
[02:40:05.595 --> 02:40:07.376]  Oh, then was it okay you got your neck broken?
[02:40:07.376 --> 02:40:09.217]  These rules are there to protect you, people!
[02:40:09.217 --> 02:40:14.760]  You know, honestly, had that happened, maybe the world would be a better place because the kid with the mask, I think, should have had his neck broken.
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:16.901]  But, you know, that's not what happened.
[02:40:16.901 --> 02:40:18.382]  But then it expands, right?
[02:40:18.382 --> 02:40:24.965]  It's edgy and great and gets you adulation down at the local Starbucks when you say it's okay to punch a Nazi.
[02:40:25.385 --> 02:40:41.042]  But then it's... But suddenly they define me as a Nazi and say... The problem, yes, the ever-expanding definition of Nazi to these idiots is anybody who isn't 100% in their camp and they will... they demand such political orthodoxy that you see them also eating their own.
[02:40:41.042 --> 02:40:45.346]  I mean, eventually you're going to have only one person left on the list who is orthodox enough.
[02:40:45.346 --> 02:40:47.528]  I was so politically... I was so politically blind
[02:40:48.109 --> 02:40:49.090]  Growing up or anything.
[02:40:49.090 --> 02:40:55.214]  I didn't even think when I married my first wife that she was half-Jewish, what that meant, and the white supremacists hating my kids.
[02:40:55.214 --> 02:41:00.437]  And then I get to have my sister's Korean adopted, my kids, you know, you can say they're part-Jewish, whatever, I'm proud of that.
[02:41:00.437 --> 02:41:06.481]  The point is, is then the Nazis hate me, but then the left calls me a Nazi everywhere, when there's not anything racist I'm even saying!
[02:41:06.481 --> 02:41:08.563]  And they go, that Nazi doesn't even deserve to be on the air!
[02:41:08.823 --> 02:41:11.904]  Right, because everybody who doesn't agree with me is a Nazi.
[02:41:11.904 --> 02:41:14.105]  I mean, that's really where it's going.
[02:41:14.105 --> 02:41:23.088]  And then you extrapolate that to, well, violence and other forms of suppression are okay against anybody who's a Nazi, but if you expand that view,
[02:41:24.008 --> 02:41:28.970]  Next thing you know, you're left with, I can, just, Nazi just means somebody that I want to punch if I'm on the left.
[02:41:28.970 --> 02:41:40.233]  Well, use the real Nazi analogy, they did it with the Jews and a few other groups first, and as we know, by the end of World War II, if a richer Nazi wanted somebody below him as money, they just called him a spy and took their stuff.
[02:41:40.233 --> 02:41:43.454]  And pretty soon it was mainly Germans who'd been serving the Reich.
[02:41:43.454 --> 02:41:46.475]  And, you know, and like, people that Hitler was jealous of.
[02:41:46.475 --> 02:41:49.996]  Oh, suddenly, suddenly, Field Marshal Rommel, you're a Jewish agent.
[02:41:50.396 --> 02:41:51.896]  We're going to make you commit suicide.
[02:41:51.896 --> 02:41:52.697]  It just expands.
[02:42:09.281 --> 02:42:21.266]  Well, hearing Rommel, they think Rommel knew, he actually wasn't, but yeah, they wanted Rommel to lead Germany into a peace deal, and Rommel had agreed that day, and they were already surveilling him and then killed him that day.
[02:42:21.266 --> 02:42:25.468]  Yeah, look, all my knowledge of it comes from that movie Valkyrie, so... It's a good movie, it's very accurate.
[02:42:25.468 --> 02:42:26.829]  Yeah, it was a great movie.
[02:42:26.829 --> 02:42:29.510]  But, you know, really, if this comparison...
[02:42:30.310 --> 02:42:33.251]  When you try to compare anything to Nazis, it doesn't work.
[02:42:33.251 --> 02:42:34.852]  You know what's like Nazis?
[02:42:34.852 --> 02:42:35.912]  Just Nazis.
[02:42:35.912 --> 02:42:37.672]  Even Neo-Nazis of today.
[02:42:37.672 --> 02:42:48.376]  No, but I agree, but if you want to do a parallel of youth brigades hitting people in the head with bike locks, calling for other people to have their speech taken, and calling to be able to use violence exclusively against somebody else, that's pretty Nazi-like.
[02:42:48.376 --> 02:42:50.597]  Look, we don't have to call it Nazi-like to make it wrong.
[02:42:50.597 --> 02:42:51.517]  It's authoritarian.
[02:42:51.517 --> 02:42:52.097]  It is.
[02:42:52.097 --> 02:42:52.758]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:52.758 --> 02:42:53.158]  Stay there.

[02:45:03.933 --> 02:45:11.861]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:45:11.861 --> 02:45:14.944]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:45:15.564 --> 02:45:20.229]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:45:20.229 --> 02:45:24.354]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:45:24.354 --> 02:45:27.497]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:45:27.497 --> 02:45:32.262]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:45:32.262 --> 02:45:35.306]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:45:35.726 --> 02:45:50.798]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:45:50.798 --> 02:45:52.339]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:45:52.339 --> 02:45:54.721]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:45:56.198 --> 02:45:57.799]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:45:57.799 --> 02:46:00.381]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your chemister.
[02:46:00.381 --> 02:46:07.865]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[02:46:07.865 --> 02:46:18.171]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[02:46:18.531 --> 02:46:26.376]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[02:46:26.376 --> 02:46:36.562]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:46:36.562 --> 02:46:38.623]  And this part is most important.
[02:46:38.623 --> 02:46:45.087]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:46:45.427 --> 02:46:46.868]  That means it's clean.
[02:46:46.868 --> 02:46:47.989]  That means it's pure.
[02:46:47.989 --> 02:46:50.891]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:46:50.891 --> 02:46:53.694]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:46:53.694 --> 02:46:59.358]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:46:59.358 --> 02:47:01.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.866 --> 02:47:24.467]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:24.467 --> 02:47:29.629]  You know, I should have introduced Mark Randazza as the guy that represented the Daily Stormer.
[02:47:29.629 --> 02:47:30.809]  You name it.
[02:47:30.809 --> 02:47:34.170]  And there he was with a Jewish lawyer and a gay lawyer.
[02:47:34.170 --> 02:47:35.930]  He was just over here in the break representing this guy.
[02:47:35.930 --> 02:47:40.011]  And when they were taking his website down off the providers, people thought it was a hoax.
[02:47:40.011 --> 02:47:44.413]  Liberal media was like, just a year ago, oh, whatever Daily Stormer, you're just doing this.
[02:47:44.413 --> 02:47:45.513]  No one's trying to take you down.
[02:47:46.477 --> 02:47:48.259]  Now you've had the court case, all of it.
[02:47:48.259 --> 02:47:51.141]  A year and a half later, take Alex Jones down!
[02:47:51.141 --> 02:47:52.923]  You know, he's a horrible criminal.
[02:47:52.923 --> 02:47:54.544]  And then they misrepresent what I've said.
[02:47:54.544 --> 02:47:57.927]  It's bad enough if I was really a Nazi, you shouldn't take me down.
[02:47:57.927 --> 02:47:59.008]  But then they lie.
[02:47:59.008 --> 02:48:01.250]  So, can you speak some of the Daily Stormer model?
[02:48:01.250 --> 02:48:04.113]  Because, again, they start with something really unpopular.
[02:48:04.113 --> 02:48:06.755]  People don't believe what's happening in America.
[02:48:06.755 --> 02:48:07.836]  Not even a defamation suit.
[02:48:07.836 --> 02:48:09.538]  Just, you're not allowed to be online.
[02:48:09.538 --> 02:48:11.380]  And you told me, you can't get into the details of it.
[02:48:12.569 --> 02:48:13.490]  Well, let's just say this.
[02:48:13.490 --> 02:48:17.814]  You've been threatened before, and lawyers have, not to even represent people.
[02:48:17.814 --> 02:48:18.715]  Yes.
[02:48:18.715 --> 02:48:25.502]  I mean, frankly, that was worse back in the Bush years when I was representing pornography companies.
[02:48:25.502 --> 02:48:33.890]  I mean, I first started carrying a gun because I was getting emails from people saying that, you know, with Bible verses telling me that I should be taken out for representing pornography.
[02:48:33.890 --> 02:48:34.210]  A.K.A.
[02:48:34.210 --> 02:48:34.731]  Larry Flynt.
[02:48:35.211 --> 02:48:35.931]  Uh, yes.
[02:48:35.931 --> 02:48:38.192]  So, uh, you know, that's when I started carrying.
[02:48:38.192 --> 02:48:46.434]  Uh, so people ask me... By the way, Larry Flynt used to publish my articles when I was exposing Inside Job, 9-11, or all this stuff, but as soon as I supported Trump, meh.
[02:48:46.434 --> 02:48:51.055]  Yeah, well, you know... But my point is, when Bush was in, I was a... Oh, he is!
[02:48:51.055 --> 02:48:52.696]  When Bush was in, I'm supposedly a communist.
[02:48:53.496 --> 02:48:55.777]  And then now that Trump's in, I'm his right-wing Nazi.
[02:48:55.777 --> 02:48:58.959]  Well, that's, you know, that's a good sign.
[02:48:58.959 --> 02:49:08.143]  If the political winds shift around you and you are nailed down to this rock of neutral civil liberties, I think that's a good place to be.
[02:49:08.143 --> 02:49:11.865]  Unfortunately, there's not too many people clinging to that rock.
[02:49:11.865 --> 02:49:18.268]  But, you know, to answer your inquiry here about, you know, what happened to the Stormer, I mean, I don't like anything on the Stormer.
[02:49:18.268 --> 02:49:20.109]  I'd never read it before I represented it.
[02:49:20.109 --> 02:49:20.990]  It attacks me a lot!
[02:49:22.470 --> 02:49:22.790]  Sorry.
[02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:25.712]  The only times I saw it, it was vicious.
[02:49:25.712 --> 02:49:27.032]  Is it still up?
[02:49:27.032 --> 02:49:27.552]  It is.
[02:49:27.552 --> 02:49:29.073]  Guys, I'll prove this.
[02:49:29.073 --> 02:49:31.334]  Type in AlexJonesDailyStormer.com.
[02:49:31.334 --> 02:49:33.755]  I mean, I hardly ever look at the lies on there.
[02:49:33.755 --> 02:49:34.755]  Go ahead.
[02:49:34.755 --> 02:49:35.875]  But, you know what?
[02:49:35.875 --> 02:49:39.657]  That rat has his right to have that up there.
[02:49:40.057 --> 02:49:41.178]  That's how I look at it.
[02:49:41.178 --> 02:49:51.343]  He has a right to express himself, but also, not only is it good that he has that right, but I think it's good that we let people like that express themselves.
[02:49:51.343 --> 02:49:54.785]  If you want to defeat that idea, bring your own idea.
[02:49:54.785 --> 02:50:07.812]  But unfortunately, what's happened is people who want these ideas down, who, I mean, I don't understand what it is about that somebody who feels that their arguments are so impotent, so weak, that they can't stand to have this website up,
[02:50:08.192 --> 02:50:13.715]  So they go to the domain name servers, they go to the domain name providers and tell them, yank their domain name.
[02:50:13.715 --> 02:50:16.376]  Then they go to their web host, yank their web hosting.
[02:50:16.376 --> 02:50:20.598]  Yank all their banking ability and drive them completely underground.
[02:50:20.598 --> 02:50:22.859]  That has done more to help this guy.
[02:50:22.859 --> 02:50:23.560]  Here, go back, go back.
[02:50:23.560 --> 02:50:24.820]  There it is, there it is.
[02:50:24.820 --> 02:50:26.441]  ADL Shill, Alex Jones.
[02:50:26.441 --> 02:50:27.662]  Here, here, let's pull up the Daily Stormer.
[02:50:27.662 --> 02:50:29.583]  I don't mean to interrupt you, but just for TV viewers.
[02:50:29.583 --> 02:50:29.763]  Go back.
[02:50:29.763 --> 02:50:30.423]  It's your show.
[02:50:30.423 --> 02:50:30.863]  No, no, no.
[02:50:30.863 --> 02:50:32.064]  It's your show when you're on.
[02:50:32.064 --> 02:50:33.245]  Scroll down, guys.
[02:50:33.245 --> 02:50:33.405]  Go ahead.
[02:50:34.236 --> 02:50:51.224]  See, I mean, look, all of this, if this is, you know, if this here, you look at this, and if you can't combat that with your viewership, and you can't combat that through arguments that you can make on this show, then, you know, that doesn't say a lot about you.
[02:50:51.224 --> 02:50:52.304]  And, frankly, you can.
[02:50:52.304 --> 02:50:54.125]  I mean, this is... Well, I'm kind of upset.
[02:50:54.125 --> 02:50:55.125]  You two, he attacked me more.
[02:50:55.125 --> 02:50:57.006]  Some of these aren't even that mean.
[02:50:57.006 --> 02:50:57.686]  Maybe he's woken up.
[02:50:57.686 --> 02:50:58.087]  Here, let's go back.
[02:50:58.087 --> 02:50:58.727]  Take a picture of you.
[02:50:59.287 --> 02:51:00.809]  Oh, I was just saying I'm a fat ass.
[02:51:00.809 --> 02:51:02.270]  Here, go back and show some of the older articles.
[02:51:02.270 --> 02:51:06.174]  Scroll down, because I know I saw stuff on there before that was mean about me.
[02:51:06.174 --> 02:51:08.596]  Yeah, I mean, look, of course, they're Nazis.
[02:51:08.596 --> 02:51:09.437]  They're not nice.
[02:51:09.437 --> 02:51:11.839]  I mean, that's part of the philosophy, right?
[02:51:11.839 --> 02:51:15.843]  But you're not going to look at feel-good pieces on here.
[02:51:15.843 --> 02:51:18.786]  But this is part of the marketplace of ideas.
[02:51:18.786 --> 02:51:23.210]  The way you defeat these ideas is you don't buy them, and you bring other ideas forward.
[02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:31.315]  I mean, I don't know of anybody who's ever been mentioned on this site that is probably proud of themselves, you know, or at least proud of the article.
[02:51:31.315 --> 02:51:35.137]  Except sometimes, you know, heck, sometimes I'm pretty proud of the people who criticize me.
[02:51:35.137 --> 02:51:41.841]  I mean, Westboro Baptist Church did a video criticizing me and, you know, threatening me with fire and brimstone.
[02:51:41.841 --> 02:51:43.703]  And the day that happened, I called my mom.
[02:51:43.703 --> 02:51:45.544]  I was like, hey mom, I've arrived.
[02:51:45.544 --> 02:51:47.785]  Westboro Baptist Church is protesting me.
[02:51:47.785 --> 02:51:49.146]  So, you know,
[02:51:49.326 --> 02:51:52.529]  Well, I confuse all the daily stormers and stormer this, stormer that.
[02:51:52.529 --> 02:51:54.131]  I know some of those stormer sides of attack.
[02:51:54.131 --> 02:51:57.275]  There's a little bit of attacks in there, but not what I remember.
[02:51:57.275 --> 02:51:57.955]  But that was years ago.
[02:51:57.955 --> 02:51:59.697]  I didn't even pay attention to that stuff in so long.
[02:51:59.697 --> 02:52:00.418]  It makes my head hurt.
[02:52:00.418 --> 02:52:02.400]  Yeah, I mean, look, Nazi ideas are silly.
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:08.827]  I mean, that's why... Sure, but this obsession with it, we have the new authoritarianism, not the Nazis 70 years ago we're facing.
[02:52:08.827 --> 02:52:11.190]  So I think your point about the Nazis were the Nazis.
[02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:11.370]  Yeah.
[02:52:11.610 --> 02:52:14.891]  Moving on now, what would you call the modern authoritarian left?
[02:52:14.891 --> 02:52:16.872]  Look, there's something new.
[02:52:16.872 --> 02:52:18.173]  I mean, this is a new thing.
[02:52:18.173 --> 02:52:19.073]  What do you call it?
[02:52:19.073 --> 02:52:19.513]  Beyond?
[02:52:19.513 --> 02:52:20.494]  I don't have a label for it.
[02:52:20.494 --> 02:52:23.415]  You know, maybe we could invent one, but really... Legal terrorism?
[02:52:23.415 --> 02:52:24.756]  I don't think it needs a label.
[02:52:24.756 --> 02:52:28.797]  I think you just need to look at it and see how utterly scary it is.
[02:52:28.797 --> 02:52:32.719]  You know, remember when... I remember when Silicon Valley was this great thing.
[02:52:32.719 --> 02:52:34.059]  It was going to disrupt everything.
[02:52:34.059 --> 02:52:40.142]  And these big closed fortresses of companies that had run everything forever were going to start to lose some ground.
[02:52:40.362 --> 02:52:43.345]  And now it's meet the new boss worse than the old boss.
[02:52:43.345 --> 02:52:44.706]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[02:52:44.706 --> 02:52:49.209]  We're going to be down to five CEOs who run everything.
[02:52:49.209 --> 02:52:55.795]  And heck, at least an authoritarian government is at least in some ways accountable to something.
[02:52:57.176 --> 02:52:58.457]  Completely unaccountable.
[02:52:58.457 --> 02:53:05.461]  Well, you look at how Bezos is so cold-blooded about everything and so mean and anti-liberal and how he basically pays no taxes.
[02:53:05.461 --> 02:53:08.903]  And then he's funding all these groups pushing for the middle class to have higher taxes.
[02:53:08.903 --> 02:53:11.064]  He's such a hypocritical villain, man.
[02:53:11.064 --> 02:53:13.186]  And then I find out he's in my business.
[02:53:13.186 --> 02:53:18.329]  He's got the Washington Post calling me a snake oil salesman when I sell supplements that he sells as well.
[02:53:18.329 --> 02:53:19.670]  I mean, it's just come on, dude.
[02:53:20.270 --> 02:53:30.174]  Well, this is, yeah, this is how, I mean, this is the result of letting these companies have so much immunity and so much control.
[02:53:30.174 --> 02:53:35.916]  I mean, you look at Google, and Google used to have, you know, used to be, don't be evil was their motto.
[02:53:35.916 --> 02:53:39.897]  And now, I think if you wanted to have a similar motto today, it'd be don't be Google.
[02:53:39.897 --> 02:53:42.698]  I mean, Google is one of the most... Boo, did you invent that?
[02:53:42.698 --> 02:53:44.899]  Instead of don't be evil, don't be Google.
[02:53:45.659 --> 02:53:48.962]  Yeah, I'm going to sue anybody who uses it.
[02:53:48.962 --> 02:53:49.402]  I'm serious.
[02:53:49.402 --> 02:53:50.703]  Hey, get that domain right now.
[02:53:50.703 --> 02:53:51.364]  Our guy's in there.
[02:53:51.364 --> 02:53:52.945]  I want don'tbegoogle.com.
[02:53:52.945 --> 02:53:53.486]  Get it!
[02:53:53.486 --> 02:53:54.186]  Get it!
[02:53:54.186 --> 02:53:55.287]  Get it!
[02:53:55.287 --> 02:53:56.028]  Ah!
[02:53:56.028 --> 02:53:58.009]  I must have it!
[02:53:58.009 --> 02:54:00.371]  We've got to get you as one of our legal analysts.
[02:54:00.371 --> 02:54:03.053]  Only if you wear a swastika armband.
[02:54:03.053 --> 02:54:05.315]  I'm not going to do that.
[02:54:05.315 --> 02:54:07.017]  Not now, nor have I ever.
[02:54:07.017 --> 02:54:07.997]  It's a joke.
[02:54:07.997 --> 02:54:10.419]  I have an Italian flag kippa, but you know, that's about it.
[02:54:10.419 --> 02:54:11.060]  You can have that.
[02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:11.540]  That's good.
[02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:13.202]  We like Italians.
[02:54:13.202 --> 02:54:14.302]  Anyway, seriously though.
[02:54:16.403 --> 02:54:21.647]  Expanding on this, without getting into the details of my cases, my lawyers don't want me to, obviously.
[02:54:21.647 --> 02:54:22.808]  Right, that would be a bad idea.
[02:54:22.808 --> 02:54:25.530]  What do you make of the assaults you've seen on us?
[02:54:25.530 --> 02:54:26.691]  You've read the lawsuits.
[02:54:26.691 --> 02:54:35.998]  I have seen, let's just generalize to the number of what I call slapsuits that have been filed against people for political reasons over the past couple of years.
[02:54:35.998 --> 02:54:37.819]  They have always been there.
[02:54:37.819 --> 02:54:41.843]  There have always been slapsuits, there have always been people who try to silence others through.
[02:54:42.563 --> 02:54:45.004]  You know, the process is the punishment sometimes.
[02:54:45.004 --> 02:54:48.184]  As you're probably aware, I'm sure you write a lot of big checks to your lawyer.
[02:54:48.184 --> 02:54:52.105]  Lawsuits are expensive and they feel extremely wasteful.
[02:54:52.105 --> 02:54:53.746]  And at the end of it, you're drained.
[02:54:53.746 --> 02:54:56.046]  And that's the whole point of it.
[02:54:56.046 --> 02:55:00.928]  I see this happening not just to you, but to a lot of people politically on the right.
[02:55:02.368 --> 02:55:04.569]  And the point of it is to drain you.
[02:55:04.569 --> 02:55:10.672]  To make sure that there is a price for expression that perhaps you cannot pay.
[02:55:10.672 --> 02:55:13.874]  And that is just completely disgusting to me.
[02:55:13.874 --> 02:55:18.176]  And what's even more disgusting is when you see cases like this that aren't just thrown out.
[02:55:18.176 --> 02:55:19.897]  I mean, they really should be thrown out.
[02:55:21.958 --> 02:55:32.506]  I mean, for example, there's a, you know, in Charlottesville, there is a very large lawsuit going on right now against the guy who drove the car into the crowd of people.
[02:55:32.506 --> 02:55:34.828]  That guy should be sued.
[02:55:34.828 --> 02:55:37.170]  I can't see any justification to let him off the hook.
[02:55:37.170 --> 02:55:37.610]  Absolutely.
[02:55:37.850 --> 02:55:43.494]  But then also, the list of defendants is anybody who talked about going to Charlottesville.
[02:55:43.494 --> 02:55:46.076]  Anybody who said, let's go to Charlottesville for this protest.
[02:55:46.076 --> 02:55:47.578]  They're not saying anybody that showed up.
[02:55:47.578 --> 02:55:51.541]  They're even calling reporters that showed up who weren't part of the alt-right.
[02:55:51.541 --> 02:55:54.283]  They're calling them alt-right and saying they need to get in trouble.
[02:55:54.283 --> 02:55:55.544]  Briefly speaking of the devil.
[02:55:56.747 --> 02:56:02.734]  If you stand with us and buy the products, which are already excellent, that you already need, all this garbage will not bring us down.
[02:56:02.734 --> 02:56:08.801]  But if it is able to bring us down, ladies and gentlemen, and we're confident that it won't, and I'm not just confident, we're extremely confident,
[02:56:10.132 --> 02:56:12.214]  Then it will set a precedent for the entire world.
[02:56:12.214 --> 02:56:13.735]  I've talked to the top lawyers across the country.
[02:56:13.735 --> 02:56:19.639]  They now agree that we are the test case to try to end the First Amendment in this country.
[02:56:19.639 --> 02:56:24.622]  And you hear what they're doing to the American Bar Association trying to get those rules through where they have no free speech.
[02:56:24.622 --> 02:56:28.364]  It's time for lawyers, too, to stand up for free speech like Mr. Randaz is doing.
[02:56:28.364 --> 02:56:29.986]  And it's time for listeners to understand.
[02:56:30.706 --> 02:56:32.428]  We make it easy to support us.
[02:56:32.428 --> 02:56:40.777]  We've got 50% off, super high-quality, concentrated, fluoride-free, organic toothpaste fortified with iodine, tea tree oil, colloidal silver, peppermint, you name it.
[02:56:40.777 --> 02:56:44.320]  The Children's has all that in it, but the tea tree and the peppermint is too strong.
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:48.164]  We have the three immune gargles and the mouthwash with colloidal silver, iodine and more.
[02:56:48.164 --> 02:56:48.785]  They're all there.
[02:56:49.185 --> 02:56:50.326]  Super next level.
[02:56:50.326 --> 02:56:56.810]  We're talking 16 ounces of the silver salt solution, one of the best types out there.
[02:56:56.810 --> 02:56:58.491]  I have not really hyped this up enough.
[02:56:58.491 --> 02:56:59.912]  I mean, the Immune Gargle, how great it is.
[02:56:59.912 --> 02:57:01.813]  But it's all set to sell out.
[02:57:01.813 --> 02:57:05.835]  I'm still putting it out there because I want you to see how great it is to keep reordering it.
[02:57:05.835 --> 02:57:07.516]  So I'm enticing you.
[02:57:07.516 --> 02:57:10.018]  Now, the Combo Packs brand news, there's no reviews of that.
[02:57:10.018 --> 02:57:13.920]  Thousands of five-star reviews for the individual products, free shipping on it, 50% off.
[02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:20.983]  We have the ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcumin level, body ease, amazing.
[02:57:20.983 --> 02:57:23.585]  If you know about turmeric, if you don't know about turmeric, learn about it.
[02:57:23.585 --> 02:57:26.087]  50% off of that right now and a bunch of other specials.
[02:57:26.087 --> 02:57:30.310]  The DNA Force special, 50% off, is going to end on Monday.
[02:57:30.310 --> 02:57:32.271]  Forgot to tell you that, so take advantage of that.
[02:57:32.271 --> 02:57:34.853]  Now stronger, DNA Force Plus.
[02:57:34.853 --> 02:57:41.238]  We've got hundreds of great t-shirts that help spread the word and reach out and let's kind of choose your own adventure, what's going to happen when you wear one.
[02:57:41.238 --> 02:57:42.959]  It's all there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:42.959 --> 02:57:43.399]  Stay with us.
[02:57:43.399 --> 02:57:43.980]  Hour number four.
[02:57:45.259 --> 02:57:47.140]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:57:47.140 --> 02:57:48.361]  Go ahead.
[02:57:48.361 --> 02:57:50.302]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[02:57:50.302 --> 02:58:00.809]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:58:00.809 --> 02:58:04.171]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[02:58:04.691 --> 02:58:05.151]  Thank you.
[02:58:05.151 --> 02:58:05.532]  Thank you.
[02:58:05.532 --> 02:58:06.052]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.086 --> 02:58:46.059]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:58:46.059 --> 02:58:53.604]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:58:55.197 --> 02:59:06.025]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:59:06.025 --> 02:59:08.146]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:59:08.146 --> 02:59:12.149]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:12.149 --> 02:59:13.350]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:19.394]  We've got the best Fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:59:19.394 --> 02:59:21.776]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:59:21.776 --> 02:59:24.417]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:59:24.417 --> 02:59:27.219]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:59:27.219 --> 02:59:29.721]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:29.721 --> 02:59:38.907]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:59:38.907 --> 02:59:43.350]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:59:48.854 --> 02:59:58.101]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.101 --> 03:00:03.665]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:00:03.665 --> 03:00:04.966]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.268 --> 03:00:17.374]  Well, Mark Randaz, a great First Amendment lawyer, one of the top guys in the country, writes great articles, even for CNN.com, fighting for the First Amendment.
[03:00:17.374 --> 03:00:18.674]  He's a real liberal.
[03:00:18.674 --> 03:00:21.476]  Because I used to be on the fence, you know, part conservative, part liberal.
[03:00:21.476 --> 03:00:22.957]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:00:22.957 --> 03:00:26.099]  They used to call me all these names, and you know, now here we are.
[03:00:26.099 --> 03:00:30.222]  They're trying to end the First Amendment, and Mark Randaz is one of the only liberal lawyers
[03:00:30.982 --> 03:00:36.427]  I've talked to a bunch of them, and they say, listen Alex, at the ACLU, you name it, they say, we're not, we agree with you.
[03:00:36.427 --> 03:00:39.310]  They go, this is off record, obviously, I'm not going to say the names.
[03:00:39.310 --> 03:00:47.698]  But they say, we agree with you, this is a really dangerous climate, it's like a 500 year flood, and we've been told by our boards and everybody, do not support you or any conservatives.
[03:00:47.698 --> 03:00:49.060]  Well, that's shameful.
[03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:52.343]  And so, you guys ought to know, if we fall, you're next.
[03:00:52.343 --> 03:00:53.304]  I mean, it's just obvious.
[03:00:53.464 --> 03:00:57.907]  Yeah, well look, the ACLU gave up on the First Amendment a long time ago.
[03:00:57.907 --> 03:01:00.629]  It's not new that they've given up on that.
[03:01:00.629 --> 03:01:09.756]  You know, and that's back to what I said earlier in the show, is that people, instead of siding with neutral civil liberties, they're siding with tribe, and you can't do that.
[03:01:09.756 --> 03:01:12.458]  You know, right now, the ball is in the conservative's court.
[03:01:12.458 --> 03:01:14.360]  My tribe is the Bill of Rights!
[03:01:14.360 --> 03:01:16.982]  Don't people get that's the real universal system of freedom?
[03:01:17.182 --> 03:01:25.124]  That's, that's what I believe in, you know, and that's what I, but when I hear people, you know, I hear people that are conservative now saying, well, we've got to play by their rules.
[03:01:25.124 --> 03:01:28.124]  We've got to bring the same thing to the left that they're bringing to us.
[03:01:28.124 --> 03:01:29.285]  The censors win.
[03:01:29.285 --> 03:01:30.085]  It's a terrible idea.
[03:01:30.085 --> 03:01:31.505]  It's a really bad idea.
[03:01:31.505 --> 03:01:34.026]  And you know, behind the scenes, News Corp has this new CEO.
[03:01:34.026 --> 03:01:38.066]  He did a big article three months ago saying, we're going to ban Alex Jones and WikiLeaks.
[03:01:38.066 --> 03:01:42.067]  Once the precedent's set, we're going to end the free internet and we're going to make hundreds of billions.
[03:01:42.067 --> 03:01:45.228]  And he bragged, he just met with the Silicon Valley heads and they agreed.
[03:01:45.828 --> 03:02:01.381]  And that's a scary, scary future, because if Silicon Valley, you know, let's say, if Google can just say it's going to completely wipe something off the internet because it doesn't agree with its politics now, and it's very easy to do that when it's a Nazi.
[03:02:01.381 --> 03:02:05.625]  Because who's going to stand up for the Nazis besides some freak First Amendment lawyer like me?
[03:02:05.905 --> 03:02:09.467]  Other than that, there's going to be a very small group at that pity party.
[03:02:09.467 --> 03:02:10.187]  But you know what?
[03:02:10.187 --> 03:02:17.070]  When you can take that political group and get rid of them, why can't you then get rid of somebody who simply opposes your candidate?
[03:02:17.070 --> 03:02:20.231]  Why can't you one day, hey, Larry Page decides he wants to run for president?
[03:02:20.231 --> 03:02:21.812]  And that's obviously the goal here.
[03:02:22.812 --> 03:02:23.273]  I think it is.
[03:02:23.273 --> 03:02:24.234]  Total power.
[03:02:24.234 --> 03:02:25.755]  The idea is control.
[03:02:25.755 --> 03:02:34.602]  I don't think you're ever going to see Google or Facebook or Twitter manage themselves ethically in any way or neutrally in any way.
[03:02:34.602 --> 03:02:43.889]  No, they are going to pick and choose winners and right now it's real easy to say it's just these people that a lot of people hate, but it's going to get less and less.
[03:02:43.889 --> 03:02:47.232]  Just like it was okay to punch a Nazi, now it's okay to punch a Republican.
[03:02:47.232 --> 03:02:49.174]  And here's a coup de grace, the final blow.
[03:02:50.794 --> 03:02:58.202]  Apple and all these companies are now finally agreeing to China and censorship and reporting Falun Gong and Christians who have their organs taken.
[03:02:58.202 --> 03:03:04.670]  And Apple is now in China and just has new terms of service where the Chinese government gets the keys to everybody's iCloud.
[03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:05.931]  This is Reuters.
[03:03:05.931 --> 03:03:11.137]  So imagine if Big Tech is signing on to Communist China, they'll sign on to anything.
[03:03:11.357 --> 03:03:22.424]  Oh yeah, look, the way the Chinese system is, you know, it's funny that we have this, the biggest communist country in the world has, through capitalism, simply become a capitalist, authoritarian state.
[03:03:22.424 --> 03:03:27.107]  And I feel like we're going the exact same direction, we're just coming at it another way.
[03:03:27.107 --> 03:03:33.311]  I mean, ultimately, whether somebody's so-called free or communist, really is of no distinction.
[03:03:33.311 --> 03:03:34.632]  It's how much power you've given.
[03:03:35.732 --> 03:03:42.456]  To these authoritarians, in a small group of authoritarians, that can make it that the wheel just can't spin anymore.
[03:03:42.456 --> 03:03:50.280]  And if you look at Davos, they admit to it, they go, we're technocrats, for five years they've been saying this, we don't want elections, we'll just run your country.
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:51.821]  They're so arrogant.
[03:03:51.821 --> 03:03:55.463]  Like, oh Bezos, he'll just run me, thank you, you're so nice.
[03:03:56.603 --> 03:03:57.324]  Sure, why not?
[03:03:57.324 --> 03:04:03.667]  I mean, when you can have unfettered wealth, you know, and unfettered control, but, you know, this is where the crazy liberal in me comes out.
[03:04:03.667 --> 03:04:08.330]  You know, maybe it's the, it is the profit motive that causes this to happen.
[03:04:08.330 --> 03:04:19.496]  Well, that's the, you have so much wealth that you can have incredible wealth for people at a base level, they don't even understand there's other stratas above them, so that gets consolidated and then takes out the lower strata.
[03:04:19.496 --> 03:04:23.359]  So, it's like Victor Hugo said, prosperity makes monsters, adversity makes men.
[03:04:23.979 --> 03:04:34.802]  Yeah, I mean, and the way that this concentrated wealth, you know, just kind of, it can warp democracy in a way that like a black hole warps light.
[03:04:34.802 --> 03:04:38.643]  And that is something that I think we're really missing if we're not creative.
[03:04:38.643 --> 03:04:40.383]  I already knew about your great work, but I'm impressed.
[03:04:40.383 --> 03:04:40.643]  I can't wait.
[03:04:40.643 --> 03:04:45.844]  You're going to come on the war room, really raise the alarm, come up in one hour, and then we're going to meet about some other stuff.
[03:04:45.844 --> 03:04:47.225]  Mr. Randazzo, thanks for coming in.
[03:04:47.225 --> 03:04:48.225]  Hey, my pleasure.
[03:04:48.225 --> 03:04:51.426]  Hey, QAnon, the new fake hijacked QAnon is attacking us.
[03:04:51.426 --> 03:04:52.886]  We're going to blow it wide open straight ahead.
[03:04:54.335 --> 03:04:56.315]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:04:56.315 --> 03:04:57.015]  Go ahead.
[03:04:57.015 --> 03:04:59.236]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[03:04:59.236 --> 03:05:03.097]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:05:03.097 --> 03:05:04.517]  It just gets old, man.
[03:05:04.517 --> 03:05:06.937]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:05:06.937 --> 03:05:09.258]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:05:09.258 --> 03:05:13.318]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:05:13.318 --> 03:05:16.579]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:05:16.579 --> 03:05:18.919]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:05:18.919 --> 03:05:20.620]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:05:20.620 --> 03:05:21.740]  Us being shut down?
[03:05:21.740 --> 03:05:22.760]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:05:23.220 --> 03:05:24.301]  You know what, Alex?
[03:05:24.301 --> 03:05:25.382]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[03:05:25.382 --> 03:05:26.483]  Hey, Frank!
[03:05:26.483 --> 03:05:32.168]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:05:32.168 --> 03:05:36.672]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:05:36.672 --> 03:05:39.555]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:05:39.555 --> 03:05:40.276]  Do you understand?
[03:05:40.276 --> 03:05:41.917]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:05:41.917 --> 03:05:43.038]  I need your help, Frank!

[03:05:51.984 --> 03:05:55.587]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:05:55.587 --> 03:06:02.071]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[03:06:02.071 --> 03:06:05.373]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread.
[03:06:05.373 --> 03:06:09.336]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[03:06:09.336 --> 03:06:11.397]  For beholden to scum!
[03:06:11.397 --> 03:06:12.097]  Russian scum!
[03:06:20.267 --> 03:06:21.688]  Please listen.
[03:06:21.688 --> 03:06:30.011]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[03:06:30.011 --> 03:06:34.132]  The function of all life is survival.
[03:06:34.132 --> 03:06:36.133]  Sleep.
[03:06:36.133 --> 03:06:38.114]  Sleep.
[03:06:38.114 --> 03:06:38.474]  Sleep.
[03:06:38.474 --> 03:06:39.794]  Oh my God!
[03:06:39.794 --> 03:06:40.535]  Oh my God!
[03:06:40.535 --> 03:06:40.975]  Oh my God!
[03:06:40.975 --> 03:06:42.075]  Lock the door!
[03:06:42.075 --> 03:06:42.715]  Lock the door!
[03:06:42.715 --> 03:06:45.737]  They're coming!
[03:06:45.737 --> 03:06:46.717]  They're coming!
[03:06:46.717 --> 03:06:46.997]  Help!
[03:06:46.997 --> 03:06:47.197]  Help!
[03:06:47.197 --> 03:06:47.737]  They're coming!
[03:06:47.737 --> 03:06:48.357]  They're coming!
[03:06:48.357 --> 03:06:48.798]  Listen to me!
[03:06:48.798 --> 03:06:49.178]  Listen!
[03:06:49.178 --> 03:06:49.598]  Help me!
[03:06:50.672 --> 03:06:51.393]  Alex, please!
[03:06:51.393 --> 03:06:51.993]  Please!
[03:06:51.993 --> 03:06:53.574]  Your necks are in danger!
[03:06:53.574 --> 03:06:54.634]  Please, listen to me!
[03:06:54.634 --> 03:06:55.815]  Something terrible!
[03:06:55.815 --> 03:06:56.515]  Please!
[03:06:56.515 --> 03:06:57.916]  Your necks are in danger!
[03:06:57.916 --> 03:06:59.997]  They're already here!
[03:06:59.997 --> 03:07:00.378]  Help!
[03:07:00.378 --> 03:07:00.998]  Your necks!
[03:07:00.998 --> 03:07:01.638]  They're coming!
[03:07:01.638 --> 03:07:03.319]  They're coming!
[03:07:03.319 --> 03:07:04.160]  Sleep.
[03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:05.280]  The seed is planted.
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:07.241]  Sleep.
[03:07:07.241 --> 03:07:08.182]  Sleep.
[03:07:08.182 --> 03:07:09.263]  Terror grows.
[03:07:09.263 --> 03:07:09.823]  Sleep.
[03:07:09.823 --> 03:07:11.824]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[03:07:11.824 --> 03:07:13.085]  That's you when you sleep!
[03:07:13.085 --> 03:07:14.766]  Sit up!
[03:07:14.766 --> 03:07:16.967]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[03:07:18.411 --> 03:07:20.614]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[03:07:20.614 --> 03:07:22.055]  Is it contagious?
[03:07:22.055 --> 03:07:22.796]  Mom!
[03:07:22.796 --> 03:07:24.018]  Brianna, help me!
[03:07:24.018 --> 03:07:25.059]  It looked right at me.
[03:07:25.059 --> 03:07:26.180]  You need to get out!
[03:07:26.180 --> 03:07:27.621]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[03:07:27.621 --> 03:07:30.344]  It was not human.
[03:07:30.344 --> 03:07:33.548]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[03:07:33.548 --> 03:07:35.350]  We're being cornered!
[03:07:35.350 --> 03:07:38.774]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[03:07:38.774 --> 03:07:39.775]  It's a barricade.
[03:08:05.723 --> 03:08:10.744]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:10.744 --> 03:08:15.265]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:15.265 --> 03:08:17.766]  Alright, well QAnon's been around for about a year.
[03:08:17.766 --> 03:08:22.707]  Got real big in the last eight months or so on these different message boards online.
[03:08:22.707 --> 03:08:25.388]  And some of what QAnon said was accurate, some of it wasn't.
[03:08:25.388 --> 03:08:29.269]  I mean, by December we were going to have Hillary Clinton in a FEMA camp.
[03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.929]  That hasn't happened.
[03:08:30.969 --> 03:08:36.493]  You know, they'll put out a photo of Singapore and saying here's where the meeting is going to be two days after it's announced.
[03:08:36.493 --> 03:08:38.194]  So that's the latest thing.
[03:08:38.194 --> 03:08:46.199]  We give you sources like Dr. Jerome Corsi who's written three number one New York Times bestselling books on elections, gotten elections changed, you know, won elections.
[03:08:48.071 --> 03:08:55.235]  We have guests like Rand Paul, like Donald Trump, and we have all these guests behind the scenes, all this intel.
[03:08:55.235 --> 03:09:06.662]  And we have sources, without getting into too many specifics, currently in Dev Group, formerly in Dev Group, in the CIA, in covert action, direct action, analysis.
[03:09:08.323 --> 03:09:09.823]  All of it who are patriots.
[03:09:09.823 --> 03:09:19.886]  And we know that Trump was recruited two years before he ran by these groups who decided not to run a coup against Obama, but to try to run an operational information war to reboot the republic.
[03:09:19.886 --> 03:09:28.188]  And so I'd ask Corsi because two months ago I told Corsi, I said, I think QAnon has been compromised and I'm getting information.
[03:09:29.158 --> 03:09:42.689]  From my Pentagon sources who knew some of the people in kind of a consortium who agreed to put out information out of CENTCOM in Florida that they thought was informative via this pen name, QAnon.
[03:09:42.689 --> 03:09:51.215]  And then a few weeks ago, I told Corsi, I said, I don't want to report on this anymore because I think it's a load of bull and it's been compromised from my sources.
[03:09:51.215 --> 03:09:54.218]  Well, I talked to one of our sources who can't come on today.
[03:09:54.218 --> 03:09:55.979]  He came on yesterday, Zach.
[03:09:55.979 --> 03:09:57.240]  And when Zach's name's known,
[03:10:00.219 --> 03:10:12.365]  I mean, his family's well-known, he's well-known, his family's involved, high-level with Eric Prince, high-level with Trump, high-level with Middle Eastern royalty.
[03:10:12.365 --> 03:10:14.566]  Yeah, Zach, connected to that.
[03:10:14.566 --> 03:10:22.229]  So, you talk about go-between in Libya and Saudi Arabia and Morocco and everywhere else.
[03:10:22.229 --> 03:10:27.732]  I mean, Zach's been in the newspapers, he's been on TV for 10 years.
[03:10:27.732 --> 03:10:29.373]  So, this is a real guy!
[03:10:31.749 --> 03:10:38.090]  Who the FBI really comes and grabs him off airplanes and really sends him to CENTCOM.
[03:10:38.090 --> 03:10:40.751]  And there's patriots that want him to say what he's saying, but others that don't.
[03:10:40.751 --> 03:10:43.791]  So that's a real guy!
[03:10:43.791 --> 03:10:55.674]  And the same, not Zach, but someone else in the State Department, White House Connect, said on March 8th, the video's up there, said, Alex, they've already agreed in the meeting a few days ago in North Korea with the intelligence chiefs
[03:10:56.664 --> 03:11:11.830]  That they are going to tacitly agree to giving up the nukes and reunification in 10 years and starting with the coal plants and all of this because Trump's really going to hit them in March, in late March if this doesn't happen.
[03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:18.193]  And Kim Jong-un has unconditionally rolled over as long as there's a public statement that we're not going to invade them.
[03:11:18.193 --> 03:11:20.354]  And as long as they're given those guarantees by the South.
[03:11:21.598 --> 03:11:23.979]  That all came out a month later, and I was asked, why am I being given this?
[03:11:23.979 --> 03:11:27.720]  Well, so you know we're credible when it happens, and so people know we're the real folks.
[03:11:27.720 --> 03:11:29.340]  By the way, watch out for QAnon.
[03:11:29.340 --> 03:11:33.381]  That's in March, and I'm skiing with my daughters.
[03:11:33.381 --> 03:11:35.982]  And I've got high-level people, and I'm going, this shouldn't be over a regular phone.
[03:11:35.982 --> 03:11:37.262]  They go, we don't give a damn.
[03:11:37.262 --> 03:11:38.803]  The president knows what you're doing.
[03:11:38.803 --> 03:11:39.703]  This is what's going on.
[03:11:39.703 --> 03:11:42.164]  I'm like, well, of course he likes QAnon.
[03:11:42.164 --> 03:11:44.044]  Some people in the White House say that.
[03:11:44.044 --> 03:11:46.125]  Earlier, it might have been good for you to get away from it.
[03:11:48.098 --> 03:11:50.019]  So I've been on air saying, I don't agree with QAnon.
[03:11:50.019 --> 03:11:55.222]  Well, QAnon, whoever it is on a message board... I'm a real person.
[03:11:55.222 --> 03:11:56.782]  I'm Alex Emmerich Jones.
[03:11:56.782 --> 03:11:57.943]  Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[03:11:57.943 --> 03:12:00.604]  I've been on air 23 years.
[03:12:00.604 --> 03:12:03.286]  Hillary Clinton calls me the dark heart.
[03:12:03.286 --> 03:12:05.227]  I'm being sued by George Soros.
[03:12:05.227 --> 03:12:11.050]  I'm being sued by Georgetown University, run by the current globalist pope.
[03:12:11.050 --> 03:12:12.570]  I deliver.
[03:12:12.570 --> 03:12:13.831]  I'm for real.
[03:12:13.831 --> 03:12:15.011]  I'm committed.
[03:12:15.011 --> 03:12:15.752]  Everybody knows it.
[03:12:17.102 --> 03:12:20.184]  I'm world famous, not bragging.
[03:12:20.184 --> 03:12:23.426]  I got 5 billion views on YouTube.
[03:12:23.426 --> 03:12:31.932]  But let me tell ya, Fancy Pants, Dandy Pants, QAnon, whoever they says they are, I used to always say about Anonymous, people are like, do you like Anonymous or not?
[03:12:31.932 --> 03:12:35.315]  Anybody can put on a Guy Fawkes mask.
[03:12:35.315 --> 03:12:45.542]  My son, that Q it up, did one, Rex Jones, Understanding Terrorism, something like that, Rob Newell had it.
[03:12:46.795 --> 03:12:48.536]  My son told the truth in that piece he did.
[03:12:48.536 --> 03:12:49.476]  The first piece he ever did.
[03:12:49.476 --> 03:12:50.497]  I said, is this guy an idiot?
[03:12:50.497 --> 03:12:54.718]  Savoy did a better job than I could when he was 10 years old.
[03:12:54.718 --> 03:12:55.879]  He's 15 now.
[03:12:55.879 --> 03:12:58.560]  Already bigger than me.
[03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:00.481]  Or like the secrets of terrorism or something like that.
[03:13:00.481 --> 03:13:03.902]  So the court's gonna take over the rest of the hour.
[03:13:03.902 --> 03:13:05.923]  It's just anybody can put on a Guy Fawkes mask.
[03:13:05.923 --> 03:13:07.283]  Was QAnon real before?
[03:13:07.283 --> 03:13:10.184]  Yeah, I was told it was a group of guys doing it.
[03:13:10.184 --> 03:13:12.405]  And then it got, it changed.
[03:13:12.405 --> 03:13:16.307]  And then this morning I was talking to one of those guys, not Zach,
[03:13:17.790 --> 03:13:28.178]  But another person, while they were playing golf, they were like, yeah, no, we were involved in that earlier, just putting out our comments on what's going on, but we haven't been in control of this for months.
[03:13:28.178 --> 03:13:32.301]  And so I don't know how I got compromised, what went on, what happened, what's going on.
[03:13:32.301 --> 03:13:38.226]  It's that QAnon, this big phenomenon, and you talked about it, suddenly YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter would let you promote it.
[03:13:38.226 --> 03:13:41.028]  And I was like, that's funny that they let this stuff go viral.
[03:13:41.028 --> 03:13:42.109]  They're not shadow banning us.
[03:13:43.288 --> 03:13:46.691]  And that's when I really got concerned and then I was told by people, yeah, watch out for it.
[03:13:46.691 --> 03:13:48.112]  So I want to move on from it.
[03:13:48.112 --> 03:13:55.477]  I'm not going to sit here and have some fight with something called Q that's on message boards and that it speaks with all the gravity of the universe.
[03:13:55.477 --> 03:13:56.678]  I told you Trump was going to win.
[03:13:56.678 --> 03:13:58.820]  He did.
[03:13:58.820 --> 03:14:00.641]  I told you we were going to restore the republic.
[03:14:00.641 --> 03:14:01.262]  It's happening.
[03:14:01.262 --> 03:14:02.863]  I told you the jobs would come back.
[03:14:02.863 --> 03:14:03.624]  It's happening.
[03:14:03.624 --> 03:14:10.068]  I told you Trump would start talking about global peace and victory for the world.
[03:14:10.068 --> 03:14:10.869]  1776 worldwide.
[03:14:10.869 --> 03:14:11.850]  It's happening.
[03:14:14.073 --> 03:14:15.194]  You ever see QAnon's face?
[03:14:15.194 --> 03:14:17.375]  You ever have the president on the show?
[03:14:17.375 --> 03:14:20.957]  The president call up to congratulate his wife when they get married?
[03:14:20.957 --> 03:14:23.519]  I'm not bragging!
[03:14:23.519 --> 03:14:24.580]  I'm real!
[03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:25.640]  Corsi's real!
[03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:27.201]  You can sink your teeth into us!
[03:14:27.201 --> 03:14:29.323]  So, Dr. Corsi, I know you're going to cover it when you come back.
[03:14:29.323 --> 03:14:30.283]  You're welcome to get into it.
[03:14:30.283 --> 03:14:35.426]  But I guess whoever this new Q guy is, he says we're hate mongers.
[03:14:35.426 --> 03:14:38.849]  He talks like the Southern Poverty Law Center now.
[03:14:38.849 --> 03:14:41.370]  Well, I think it's pretty humorous, actually.
[03:14:43.149 --> 03:14:54.918]  This psyop that is now Q has decided that the best way to advance the music is to get all these people hating us.
[03:14:54.918 --> 03:15:01.703]  So they have a piece, a disinformation piece they published, Alex, on you and me.
[03:15:01.703 --> 03:15:05.046]  And this Q has just posted them.
[03:15:05.046 --> 03:15:05.967]  Post 1339 and post 1340.
[03:15:05.967 --> 03:15:09.209]  So this is supposed to draw out an army of haters.
[03:15:11.863 --> 03:15:16.165]  Now capturing all their hate messages, a lot of them are, you know, scatological.
[03:15:16.165 --> 03:15:24.869]  I mean, these are, if this is the group that Q wants to recruit, you're not recruiting the highest and the best.
[03:15:24.869 --> 03:15:37.434]  And if he wants to divide those of us like you and me, Alex, who supported Donald Trump, the 2016 election, and turn the movement against us and other Trump supporters, I think it's pretty obvious that
[03:15:38.402 --> 03:15:40.645]  Now Q's true role is coming out.
[03:15:40.645 --> 03:15:44.170]  And Q talks like the Southern Barbary Law Center or ADL now.
[03:15:44.170 --> 03:15:45.091]  And let's understand that.
[03:15:46.044 --> 03:15:47.445]  We helped get Trump get elected.
[03:15:47.445 --> 03:15:50.186]  Now this imaginary person is the Trump defender.
[03:15:50.186 --> 03:15:51.446]  It says we're bad.
[03:15:51.446 --> 03:15:53.307]  Good luck with that, Southern Property Law Center.
[03:15:53.307 --> 03:15:55.527]  You have been lied to.
[03:15:55.527 --> 03:15:57.268]  My name is Kevin Schipp.
[03:15:57.268 --> 03:15:59.969]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[03:15:59.969 --> 03:16:05.291]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-mose on the shadow government ever.

[03:19:06.878 --> 03:19:09.740]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[03:19:51.555 --> 03:19:57.840]  With Z Field and Infowarslife.com.
[03:19:57.840 --> 03:20:00.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.067 --> 03:20:28.069]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:28.069 --> 03:20:42.792]  I'm going to have the next hour here where we can look at some new developing intelligence that I think is important to understand the most critical developments going on in Donald Trump's basically defense of his presidency.
[03:20:43.927 --> 03:20:50.148]  I'm seeing, by the way, we've got just these new posts from Q attacking Alex Jones and me directly.
[03:20:50.148 --> 03:20:55.529]  I think this is a PSYOP operation.
[03:20:55.529 --> 03:20:56.709]  We're not going to discuss it at length.
[03:20:56.709 --> 03:20:59.210]  I'll discuss it on Twitter.
[03:20:59.210 --> 03:21:09.092]  I'm encouraging everyone who's impressed by this new Q to continue the scatological kinds of abuse you're doing, attacking me.
[03:21:09.092 --> 03:21:10.192]  It's kind of amusing.
[03:21:11.031 --> 03:21:22.178]  When I look back at the attacks I've had on Unfit for Command in 2004, and then in 2008, it goes on with the Obama Nation when I oppose Barack Obama.
[03:21:22.178 --> 03:21:31.283]  It looks like the same group as Soros and Saul Alinsky, communists, have joined the Q movement.
[03:21:31.283 --> 03:21:35.206]  Because I've got the same kind of abuse I got writing those books.
[03:21:35.206 --> 03:21:38.688]  I mean, it's going to be, it's actually kind of abusing.
[03:21:39.691 --> 03:22:03.601]  And if this is what Q wants for his supporters, if this is where Q is headed, I think it's just proving the points that we're making today in that this is not a way to support Donald Trump by dividing the movement, by getting one group of extreme haters to express their views and terms that would not be allowed at any acceptable party or gathering.
[03:22:03.601 --> 03:22:05.761]  I mean, if this is the nature of what
[03:22:07.737 --> 03:22:09.678]  The Q support is all about.
[03:22:09.678 --> 03:22:13.461]  I doubt Donald Trump would want to have anything to do with it.
[03:22:13.461 --> 03:22:15.202]  So go ahead and distinguish yourselves.
[03:22:15.202 --> 03:22:16.183]  I'm going to watch it all day.
[03:22:16.183 --> 03:22:24.789]  And I may, I may toy with it for a while, bat it back and forth and see if I can't get it to go into even more of a frenzy.
[03:22:24.789 --> 03:22:28.191]  But you're doing a pretty good job with it right now, Q supporters.
[03:22:28.191 --> 03:22:29.152]  Just keep at it.
[03:22:29.152 --> 03:22:34.776]  I'm having a good time with it and we'll, you know, I'm sure you're going to ruin me just like they ruined me.
[03:22:34.776 --> 03:22:35.116]  And, um,
[03:22:35.916 --> 03:22:39.079]  Unfit for Command and my 30 other books.
[03:22:39.079 --> 03:22:43.042]  This is not my first rodeo through this hate campaign.
[03:22:43.042 --> 03:22:43.783]  But have at it.
[03:22:43.783 --> 03:22:46.305]  Let's see how good you guys are.
[03:22:46.305 --> 03:22:53.171]  Now, what I really want to take in this hour is really not to waste time with more false Q stuff.
[03:22:53.171 --> 03:22:54.812]  You guys can all figure it out yourself.
[03:22:54.812 --> 03:23:03.620]  I decided for myself that I was done trying to support Q, I think, when it did change or when I perceived a change.
[03:23:04.618 --> 03:23:10.823]  I'm not going to support a psy-op that's designed to divide the movement and destroy Donald Trump.
[03:23:10.823 --> 03:23:18.989]  I'm going to just now continue with what we see as real information here to bring this to you in a current basis.
[03:23:18.989 --> 03:23:24.913]  Because I don't think we need Q&A any longer to really give us open source information with riddles.
[03:23:26.776 --> 03:23:36.221]  There's an article that's been posted by Zero Hedge and it's keying off of a very important article that's on the Wall Street Journal.
[03:23:36.221 --> 03:23:55.332]  And as many of you know who have been following the investigation of Mueller into the special prosecutor, an issue has arisen in which the FBI and the Department of Justice are refusing to turn over to Dennis Nunes in the House Intelligence Committee
[03:23:56.144 --> 03:23:59.645]  And to the Congress in general.
[03:23:59.645 --> 03:24:04.926]  It looks like maybe up to a million pages of FBI and Department of Justice records.
[03:24:04.926 --> 03:24:19.568]  And, in fact, Rosenstein went on record as saying that he wasn't going to be extorted, he was not going to do anything that he needed to do, that, you know, he was compromised the agency, etc., etc.
[03:24:19.568 --> 03:24:24.729]  Well, when it turns out, I think, and this I think is really the shocking part of this,
[03:24:25.544 --> 03:24:32.410]  Is that there is a, it is now clearly admitted, Wall Street Journal picked up on it.
[03:24:32.410 --> 03:24:34.212]  Nunes has broadcast it.
[03:24:34.212 --> 03:24:40.857]  The FBI had a mole inside the campaign of Donald Trump.
[03:24:40.857 --> 03:24:46.182]  So the FBI, now we're talking about, again, the deep state conspirators.
[03:24:47.223 --> 03:24:56.348]  People like Andrew McCabe, who is number two under Comey, James Comey himself, who had to know about this mole.
[03:24:56.348 --> 03:24:58.749]  We're also talking about Strozik and Page.
[03:24:58.749 --> 03:25:02.651]  Strozik, head of the counterintelligence operation.
[03:25:02.651 --> 03:25:04.392]  These are all college educated.
[03:25:04.392 --> 03:25:07.954]  These are not the FBI that went out and caught bank robbers.
[03:25:08.732 --> 03:25:20.938]  And what they decided to do in their New World Order insanity, their want no borders, their love of Hillary Clinton, decided they were going to commit treason.
[03:25:20.938 --> 03:25:25.840]  And they got a mole placed within Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:35.685]  Now, what the article, I think, says clearly is that this spells that, in fact, the FBI was spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:25:35.685 --> 03:25:37.766]  And it's spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:25:39.072 --> 03:25:47.697]  That's never been done by official Justice Department agency personnel in the history of the nation.
[03:25:47.697 --> 03:25:58.144]  Not only spying, but then leaking to the press, committing any number of crimes, using the Fusion GPS dossier, which James Comey told Congress,
[03:25:58.812 --> 03:26:11.777]  Could not be authenticated, could not be validated, as the basis for an agreement, a warrant, to go ahead and have electronic surveillance of Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:26:11.777 --> 03:26:15.879]  Now the mole, I think the mole is Carter Page.
[03:26:15.879 --> 03:26:20.441]  And Carter Page was a former FBI paid informant.
[03:26:20.441 --> 03:26:21.681]  We can see that from 2015.
[03:26:21.681 --> 03:26:27.504]  And what his job as a mole, as a spy, was to go into the
[03:26:28.351 --> 03:26:32.412]  Trump campaign and talk to everybody you could talk to about Russia.
[03:26:32.412 --> 03:26:40.615]  Because you see under the rules of FISA, electronic surveillance, the warrant was issued only on Carter Page.
[03:26:40.615 --> 03:26:55.941]  But anybody Carter Page talked to, including Jeff Sessions, or any of the other campaign officials, as collateral, could now suddenly be under electronic surveillance by the Department of Justice.
[03:26:55.941 --> 03:26:57.121]  We don't know how many
[03:26:57.862 --> 03:27:06.407]  of Donald Trump's campaign were under electronic surveillance, but I bet most of all the top officials.
[03:27:06.407 --> 03:27:23.978]  And then the electronic surveillance we now know continued at least through an extension in July 2017 that Rod Rosenstein gave it, which means that the FBI and the Department of Justice were conducting electronic surveillance on Donald Trump
[03:27:25.228 --> 03:27:32.652]  Through the first year of Donald Trump's presidency, with the goal of trying to impeach Donald Trump.
[03:27:32.652 --> 03:27:36.513]  This is a coup d'etat based on false premises.
[03:27:36.513 --> 03:27:50.640]  Now, this is why Rod Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions, and I do not trust Jeff Sessions, why they both want to keep these papers from Congress.
[03:27:50.640 --> 03:27:52.581]  Because the moment these papers are at Congress,
[03:27:53.419 --> 03:28:03.410]  Congress is going to realize that there's been a conspiracy involving even Mueller, who Comey consulted with after he was fired, as to what Comey should do.
[03:28:03.410 --> 03:28:15.122]  And what Donald Trump should do right now in order to preserve these documents, I think, is over the weekend somehow or other secure them so these documents aren't destroyed.
[03:28:15.959 --> 03:28:17.821]  There's a million pages there.
[03:28:17.821 --> 03:28:24.266]  Donald Trump ought to make sure, even if he needs to send in military troops, that these papers are preserved.
[03:28:24.266 --> 03:28:36.436]  Because once these papers are made public or made available to Congress, these papers, the Department of Justice and the FBI, Mueller's investigation is finished and the coup d'etat
[03:28:37.330 --> 03:28:41.440]  Criminals are going to have to face justice in Donald Trump's counterattack.
[03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:45.449]  This could not be more important breaking news and it's developing right now.
[03:28:53.260 --> 03:28:54.160]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:28:54.160 --> 03:28:56.561]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.

[03:32:57.345 --> 03:33:15.256]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.256 --> 03:33:19.638]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:19.638 --> 03:33:21.980]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.365 --> 03:33:42.158]  This is Donald Corsi, and I'm doing this hour to try to bring to you some of the most recent intelligence that we're getting on how Donald Trump is planning to fire, first of all, Mueller, the special counselor.
[03:33:42.158 --> 03:33:46.882]  Secondly, Rod Rosenstein, number two in the Justice Department, and third, Jeff Sessions.
[03:33:46.882 --> 03:33:48.904]  And I think the plan is developing very fast.
[03:33:51.474 --> 03:33:56.398]  If you just stay with me, we'll be able to show you the several dimensions of this developing plan.
[03:33:56.398 --> 03:34:17.274]  The first one being that we now know that the FBI hid a mole, a spy, within Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 while they were utilizing this fake Russian dossier in order to develop the idea of Russian collusion
[03:34:18.012 --> 03:34:21.333]  Which so far has not developed into any serious indictments.
[03:34:21.333 --> 03:34:25.274]  I'll talk in the next segment about the one indictment that has resulted from that.
[03:34:25.274 --> 03:34:28.695]  It does not look like it will result in a conviction.
[03:34:28.695 --> 03:34:36.137]  But at any rate, there's a million pages that the FBI is refusing to turn over to Congress.
[03:34:36.137 --> 03:34:37.897]  And Dennis Nunes has been demanding it.
[03:34:38.593 --> 03:34:50.637]  Now, and so far, Rosenstein even gave a little speech saying, stamping his foot and saying, I'm not going to be extorted into giving to Congress anything which I'm not supposed to give.
[03:34:50.637 --> 03:35:01.821]  Well, Rod Rosenstein then got a lecture on how the fact is that Congress has oversight rights over the FBI and the Department of Justice, and they can demand these papers.
[03:35:01.821 --> 03:35:05.122]  So it's essentially not a standoff,
[03:35:05.652 --> 03:35:21.489]  But it's a refusal by Rosenstein to do his job, comply with the Congressional Oversight Request, which has led Congress both to develop articles of impeachment for Rosenstein and contempt charges for Jeff Sessions.
[03:35:21.489 --> 03:35:23.972]  Now, why they don't want to turn these pages over
[03:35:24.782 --> 03:35:27.304]  Is because it's developing a couple of stories.
[03:35:27.304 --> 03:35:47.816]  One was in the Wall Street Journal, another in Zero Hedge today, in which Zero Hedge made it clear that in a meeting with the FBI and Devin Nunes, who is the GOP head of the House Intelligence Committee, the FBI blinked.
[03:35:47.816 --> 03:35:51.498]  It allowed Nunes and his staff to begin reviewing
[03:35:52.225 --> 03:35:53.546]  These million pages.
[03:35:53.546 --> 03:35:58.368]  Now, Nunes evidently figured out the name of the mole.
[03:35:58.368 --> 03:36:01.910]  And this is, I think, the first step towards turning the tables.
[03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:17.198]  Because once the mole is identified, once we know that the, you know, if you think about it for a minute, once we know that the Department of Justice and the FBI, and I say this conspiracy started
[03:36:17.859 --> 03:36:29.806]  Within the FBI, this coup d'etat conspiracy where Strozik and Page started exchanging these messages and decided they were not going to let Donald Trump be president.
[03:36:29.806 --> 03:36:43.093]  Then they advanced this Fusion GPS dossier, which Comey said, told Congress under oath, could not be authenticated by the Department of Justice, yet they used it as evidence in part of Russian collusion.
[03:36:43.797 --> 03:36:46.038]  Something which, by the way, is not even a crime.
[03:36:46.038 --> 03:36:48.819]  There's no crime of Russian collusion.
[03:36:48.819 --> 03:37:03.606]  And now we know they went so far as to put a mole, I think the mole is Carter Page, who in 2015 had played a role with the Department of Justice in another sting operation on Russia, involving U.S.
[03:37:03.606 --> 03:37:04.967]  citizens.
[03:37:04.967 --> 03:37:09.089]  Now, this whole plot means that
[03:37:10.385 --> 03:37:31.373]  The FBI and the Department of Justice went so far as to not only do electronic surveillance of Donald Trump's campaign on a false pretense, put a spy within the middle of them, but continued the electronic surveillance with Rosenstein issuing an extension of it July 2017.
[03:37:31.373 --> 03:37:38.316]  So they were collecting data, the FBI and the Department of Justice, on Donald Trump's campaign while Donald Trump was president.
[03:37:40.186 --> 03:38:00.990]  If we go one level deeper into the story, what you're going to find out, this came in, I think the conservative treehouse did a good job and supports a lot of the intelligence that I've been given about the operation being one that involved the CIA directly and John Brennan specifically.
[03:38:00.990 --> 03:38:07.312]  Because John Brennan was, I think, the handler of Barack Obama since the beginning.
[03:38:09.446 --> 03:38:20.091]  John Brennan did with his private research firm is they went in and they stole the passport information from Barack Obama so as to sanitize it.
[03:38:20.091 --> 03:38:23.172]  This was before the 2008 election.
[03:38:23.172 --> 03:38:35.758]  Now, essentially, I think what's happening here is that Rosenstein and Sessions, by trying to deny Congress the right to see these papers, know, as does Devin Nunes,
[03:38:36.505 --> 03:39:04.466]  uh... and grassley in the house to the senate judiciary committee that once the american people know what's in these million pages and the depth of which a coup d'etat a treasonous conspiracy was hatched at the heart of the uh... fbi that's the central premise of my book killing the deep state uh... you can get that deep state premise in your heads
[03:39:05.757 --> 03:39:18.865]  The Department of Justice, supposedly there for law, went so deeply rogue that they thought they could begin breaking laws in order to get Donald Trump impeached.
[03:39:18.865 --> 03:39:21.346]  That's the heart of what we're talking about.
[03:39:21.346 --> 03:39:31.012]  And Mueller was again put in place to have the first round in which he was going to impeach Donald Trump.
[03:39:32.370 --> 03:39:39.676]  The problem is that Mueller's failed in his assignment because Donald Trump was not guilty of Russian collusion.
[03:39:39.676 --> 03:39:55.069]  And if these pages get brought forward, and we see the involvement not only of Rosenstein, Comey, McCabe, Strozic, and dozens of others in the FBI Department of Justice, but extending over into John Brennan,
[03:39:56.036 --> 03:40:01.261]  This is a giant criminal conspiracy we know goes all the way up to Obama and Hillary that ordered it.
[03:40:01.261 --> 03:40:05.024]  Let me just stop you there because you're going to take over in the next segment, but I've been sitting here watching and listening to you.
[03:40:05.024 --> 03:40:09.208]  I just wanted to add something here about the whole QAnon thing that I said we were going to get away from.
[03:40:09.208 --> 03:40:12.051]  I had a chance to go read that latest work of fiction.
[03:40:13.328 --> 03:40:18.174]  We just were moving away from it because we could see dozens of the predictions didn't come true.
[03:40:18.174 --> 03:40:19.135]  We got attacked.
[03:40:19.135 --> 03:40:24.361]  Now this, whoever this Q latest cutout is, is saying we attacked them.
[03:40:24.361 --> 03:40:25.542]  No, they attacked us.
[03:40:25.542 --> 03:40:26.844]  They attacked you.
[03:40:26.844 --> 03:40:28.065]  We're not good Trump supporters.
[03:40:28.065 --> 03:40:29.807]  We're actually Hillary supporters.
[03:40:29.807 --> 03:40:31.289]  That's why Hillary has people suing us.
[03:40:31.289 --> 03:40:32.710]  Or calls me Dark Carter.
[03:40:32.710 --> 03:40:33.812]  You know, all this crap.
[03:40:34.332 --> 03:40:35.212]  We're real people.
[03:40:35.212 --> 03:40:36.072]  These are our names.
[03:40:36.072 --> 03:40:36.552]  We're here.
[03:40:36.552 --> 03:40:41.773]  So I demand whoever the cutout is, Q, prove who you are, Q. Prove who you are.
[03:40:41.773 --> 03:40:47.674]  Come on the show then as a real boy, not Pinocchio, but a real boy in the real world.
[03:40:47.674 --> 03:40:52.075]  But you have to tell the truth and risk your life yet before the little fairy makes you a real boy.
[03:40:52.075 --> 03:40:53.556]  See, Dr. Corsi's a real boy.
[03:40:53.556 --> 03:40:54.176]  I'm a real boy.
[03:40:54.176 --> 03:40:55.896]  24 years on air.
[03:40:55.896 --> 03:40:57.976]  Corsi, decades fighting the globalists.
[03:40:57.976 --> 03:40:59.097]  Best-selling books.
[03:40:59.097 --> 03:41:00.657]  One of the top advisors to Lou Dobbs.
[03:41:01.577 --> 03:41:04.878]  Exposing the whole New World Order, the whole globalism, worldwide!
[03:41:04.878 --> 03:41:13.381]  We're there exposing it with Ron Paul and others, how the whole global system works, how the New World Order operates, how the nation-state could be rebooted to come back, and now it's happening!
[03:41:13.381 --> 03:41:15.582]  The world, us and our listeners, built!
[03:41:15.582 --> 03:41:27.967]  We're the resistance, and you came along, I know, and you were gonna teach us all anonymously on some message board how the cow ate the cabbage, and some of what you said was true, like, Trump is going to meet in Singapore two days after it was announced.
[03:41:27.967 --> 03:41:28.587]  Oh my God!
[03:41:29.167 --> 03:41:33.031]  Here, you know, let me tell you that tomorrow is Saturday.
[03:41:33.031 --> 03:41:36.994]  Wow, I'm Q now, I'm like magic now, I'm a big boy now too.
[03:41:36.994 --> 03:41:39.637]  So I had a chance to go read it while I was listening to you.
[03:41:39.637 --> 03:41:40.457]  What a joke.
[03:41:40.457 --> 03:41:46.643]  So we're going to publish, Corsi, why don't you write an article about 20 times QAnon said outrageous crap that wasn't true.
[03:41:47.944 --> 03:41:50.526]  We'll give whoever that is just what they want.
[03:41:50.526 --> 03:41:52.188]  We're so scared.
[03:41:52.188 --> 03:41:59.233]  We're pooping our little pants right now over you, the mighty whoever you are from the Clinton campaign of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:41:59.233 --> 03:42:00.515]  That's what you write like.
[03:42:00.515 --> 03:42:05.379]  We're going to take on Soros and the Globalists and the New World Order and Georgetown, Suomi and all the attacks.
[03:42:05.379 --> 03:42:08.181]  But my God, you're so good, QAnon.
[03:42:08.181 --> 03:42:10.203]  You expose Corsi as an evil
[03:42:11.368 --> 03:42:12.989]  Clinton operative and me.
[03:42:12.989 --> 03:42:14.430]  Oh, exactly.
[03:42:14.430 --> 03:42:18.091]  Oh, thank God you're here to save Trump.
[03:42:18.091 --> 03:42:19.552]  Thank you for all you've done.

[03:42:43.285 --> 03:42:44.065]  No, no, no, no.
[03:42:44.065 --> 03:42:47.027]  They do other things when they're not being QAnon.
[03:42:47.027 --> 03:42:50.609]  The new Southern Poverty Law Center powered QAnon.
[03:42:50.609 --> 03:42:51.790]  Treasons sold separately.

[03:43:10.379 --> 03:43:13.381]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:43:13.381 --> 03:43:22.167]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:43:24.248 --> 03:43:43.843]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.

[03:45:54.312 --> 03:45:57.334]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[03:45:57.334 --> 03:46:01.536]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[03:46:01.536 --> 03:46:08.861]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[03:46:08.861 --> 03:46:11.983]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[03:46:12.703 --> 03:46:32.773]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[03:46:32.773 --> 03:46:36.335]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[03:46:36.875 --> 03:46:48.101]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[03:46:48.101 --> 03:46:57.325]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[03:46:57.325 --> 03:46:59.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.450 --> 03:47:12.853]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:12.853 --> 03:47:17.637]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.637 --> 03:47:35.491]  This is Jerome Corsi and I'm going to take this last segment following up what Alex led with and that is this attack on Infowars and on me and Alex personally.
[03:47:36.458 --> 03:47:42.040]  But it has been launched by QAnon today, in posts 1339 and 1340.
[03:47:42.040 --> 03:47:56.686]  Now, one of the points I want to make, I can read of course in my Twitter feed, I can look at the notifications, and what's clear is that there's an army out there of posters who are ready to pounce.
[03:47:56.686 --> 03:47:59.607]  In other words, all the haters.
[03:47:59.607 --> 03:48:03.609]  This again, how do you identify a psych-op?
[03:48:03.609 --> 03:48:04.609]  The psy-op is going to be
[03:48:05.350 --> 03:48:10.952]  Basically, an attack founded on half-truths or part-truths.
[03:48:10.952 --> 03:48:30.018]  So you get an article posted on Reddit that is this long thread about how Alex and I had had this conspiracy, and our conspiracy was really to steal QAnon's audience, build QAnon's audience up and then steal it, which is pretty much a joke.
[03:48:30.018 --> 03:48:33.859]  I think only a high school student would think that could work.
[03:48:35.115 --> 03:48:45.884]  Um, and basically when I supported Q, I did it because both Alex and I had intelligence and confirmation from pretty, pretty high up that this was legitimate for a while.
[03:48:45.884 --> 03:48:59.436]  But when it changed, uh, all of our intelligence sources, mine, I can verify for personally, alerted me to it, that, you know, looks like an entire, um, psych-op stealing of the identity.
[03:48:59.436 --> 03:48:59.736]  Why?
[03:48:59.736 --> 03:49:03.239]  Because the Q who was opposing originally,
[03:49:03.905 --> 03:49:12.088]  Well, I think it was military intelligence who was close to General Flynn would never divide their group.
[03:49:12.088 --> 03:49:20.091]  A leader who divides their group by taking people like myself, who was more than willing to continue to support Q,
[03:49:21.514 --> 03:49:27.296]  And Alex and I have had our differences in terms of whether to continue or not to continue.
[03:49:27.296 --> 03:49:37.098]  I've always been wanting to take the best of what Q was saying when it was the Flynn Military Intelligence Group.
[03:49:37.098 --> 03:49:38.999]  This group is not them.
[03:49:38.999 --> 03:49:42.320]  Even the syntax, the language is different in the posting.
[03:49:42.320 --> 03:49:43.620]  This is very formulaic.
[03:49:43.620 --> 03:49:50.462]  This is done by AI, artificial intelligence, that generates these kind of threads.
[03:49:51.463 --> 03:50:01.328]  And you can see the, you know, they've got some points being made and then routine statements that expand your thinking, you know, etc.
[03:50:01.328 --> 03:50:07.631]  Then questions asked, and then predictions made that don't come true.
[03:50:07.631 --> 03:50:10.772]  This Syakou is actually posting pictures.
[03:50:10.772 --> 03:50:18.196]  You know, Alex was ridiculing the one of posting a picture from Singapore as if that was a big mystery after the White House announced
[03:50:19.048 --> 03:50:21.730]  The meeting was going to be held in Singapore.
[03:50:21.730 --> 03:50:24.032]  So this is distinguished by several things.
[03:50:24.032 --> 03:50:29.055]  One is you've got open source information.
[03:50:29.055 --> 03:50:45.587]  And those who are decoding this, some medic or whatever, I can't remember the name of it, will take one of these Q's posts and just give you all the newspaper articles from which it's derived.
[03:50:45.587 --> 03:50:46.387]  But this is 100% open source.
[03:50:48.525 --> 03:51:07.791]  Um, then thrown in with some cryptic things and some conspiracy-like questions and, you know, it mimics the original Q style, but it is, um, distinguishable in its characteristics, which are largely hollow compared to the original Q style.
[03:51:07.791 --> 03:51:10.432]  And secondly, then, you know, the real sign of a PSYOP
[03:51:11.647 --> 03:51:21.193]  And by the way, I've been, you know, I wrote on Fit for Command with John O'Neill in 2004 and were just vilified by the sorrow supporters of John Kerry.
[03:51:21.193 --> 03:51:25.515]  I mean, things that were said were just, you know, outrageous attacks.
[03:51:25.515 --> 03:51:32.920]  Personal, scatological, foul language, insults, threats, you know, saying
[03:51:34.092 --> 03:51:36.854]  We've lost our minds.
[03:51:36.854 --> 03:51:57.544]  These are all generated in advance so that you push the button and the trolls pop into, you know, and some people are here really, I'm sure, confused or wanting to jump in on the hate bandwagon, but Q started a hate bandwagon.
[03:51:57.544 --> 03:52:01.426]  Reminds me also when I published Abomination in 2008.
[03:52:03.444 --> 03:52:07.125]  Or question Barack Obama's birth certificate.
[03:52:07.125 --> 03:52:11.646]  Again, the same kind of vilifying personal attacks.
[03:52:11.646 --> 03:52:22.589]  This cue is really interesting because he is vilifying me and particularly for writing a book, you know, monetized it to sell a book.
[03:52:22.589 --> 03:52:26.170]  I monetized the Patriot movement to sell a book.
[03:52:26.170 --> 03:52:29.571]  Well, you know, first of all, if I wanted to monetize a movement,
[03:52:31.708 --> 03:52:41.733]  I wouldn't be saying anything possible to keep the Q audience even lying when I thought that it was no longer authentic.
[03:52:41.733 --> 03:52:52.479]  I have to tell you, though, that thank you, Q, I mean, this new Q for attacking the book because now what you've done, oh, people say they're throwing their book away and they want their money back and all these things.
[03:52:52.479 --> 03:52:55.940]  Well, I mean, this is classic troll stuff.
[03:52:55.940 --> 03:52:56.841]  Want their money back?
[03:52:56.841 --> 03:52:57.381]  Well, fine.
[03:52:57.381 --> 03:53:00.943]  You know, I mean, there's nothing wrong
[03:53:01.658 --> 03:53:03.859]  With making a profit, selling a book.
[03:53:03.859 --> 03:53:04.700]  Donald Trump.
[03:53:04.700 --> 03:53:08.382]  These Q supporters are supposed to be supporting.
[03:53:08.382 --> 03:53:10.183]  They just look critical thinking.
[03:53:10.183 --> 03:53:19.688]  They're attacking the fundamental profit motive that it's criminal now or somehow subversive to write a book and to promote it and expect to be paid for it.
[03:53:19.688 --> 03:53:24.190]  Well, Donald Trump gets paid for his books.
[03:53:24.190 --> 03:53:27.612]  And, uh, we don't, when I was with WND, we wanted to sell the
[03:53:28.898 --> 03:53:33.462]  Various Trump mega gear.
[03:53:33.462 --> 03:53:37.224]  Trump licenses all that and the Trump organization sells it.
[03:53:37.224 --> 03:53:39.286]  I'm sure for a profit.
[03:53:39.286 --> 03:53:42.328]  And they don't allow it to be resold.
[03:53:42.328 --> 03:53:47.552]  So, you know, there's, I guess Donald Trump is profiteering on the Trump train.
[03:53:47.552 --> 03:53:49.133]  Is that what it is?
[03:53:49.133 --> 03:53:53.316]  Or is this really basically a socialist attack?
[03:53:54.215 --> 03:53:57.896]  You know, profiteering, it's wrong to make money.
[03:53:57.896 --> 03:54:06.819]  That type of attack is usually left to George Soros and Saul Alinsky, disinformation artists.
[03:54:06.819 --> 03:54:16.382]  And if the Q movement is going to be swayed by a leftist socialist attack against writing a book and making money, calling that profiteering.
[03:54:16.382 --> 03:54:20.143]  By the way, the classic books on KGB
[03:54:21.352 --> 03:54:23.233]  Um, techniques.
[03:54:23.233 --> 03:54:27.176]  Profiteering ends up being one of the words they emphasize to use most.
[03:54:27.176 --> 03:54:29.817]  That and, um, social justice.
[03:54:29.817 --> 03:54:38.463]  That, um, capitalism violates social justice and is run by a group of people seeking to profiteer, uh, from class distinctions.
[03:54:38.463 --> 03:54:45.267]  So, the current Q lines are pretty much Communism 101.
[03:54:45.267 --> 03:54:47.328]  Pretty much Communism, and this is the first time
[03:54:48.146 --> 03:55:03.500]  That Q and the entire movement since last October has decided to call out Alex Jones and me in order to provoke a controversy and a fight.
[03:55:03.500 --> 03:55:13.608]  What leader, you know, developing the Patriots movement would not embrace someone like myself who, you know, even disagreements with Alex
[03:55:14.867 --> 03:55:18.590]  In terms of when the Q movement had turned into a PSYOP.
[03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:20.891]  Now, I'm convinced Alex is right.
[03:55:20.891 --> 03:55:23.673]  It is 100% cooperated as a PSYOP.
[03:55:23.673 --> 03:55:27.616]  And possibly I should have listened a little bit more carefully earlier on.
[03:55:27.616 --> 03:55:37.363]  But I found, you know, the Q, when it was the military intelligence with General Flynn, were advancing some good information and were doing it in an authentic way.
[03:55:37.363 --> 03:55:43.147]  And I could take information that I had, my analytic information as an investigative journalist,
[03:55:43.800 --> 03:55:53.062]  And weave it together and we can bring people along to expand to millions the group that we're following Q. That was always my stated aim.
[03:55:53.062 --> 03:55:57.583]  Now they have Q turn on us and attack us.
[03:55:57.583 --> 03:55:59.344]  You know, some of the big supporters.
[03:55:59.344 --> 03:56:07.346]  I mean, I don't remember George Washington attacking Thomas Paine or getting to see Sam Adams.
[03:56:07.346 --> 03:56:09.326]  Now he's really crazy.
[03:56:09.326 --> 03:56:10.186]  He's profiteering.
[03:56:10.186 --> 03:56:12.587]  Unless, you know, maybe George Washington
[03:56:13.385 --> 03:56:17.646]  Had a future vision that could say, oh, Sam Adams is going to be making a beer out of this.
[03:56:17.646 --> 03:56:20.627]  I think it's pretty ridiculous.
[03:56:20.627 --> 03:56:30.770]  And if I were to read you, some of these are so some of these posts that I'm being attacked with right now are just too scurrilous even to bother to write.
[03:56:30.770 --> 03:56:31.671]  I've saved some of them.
[03:56:31.671 --> 03:56:32.951]  I may post later.
[03:56:32.951 --> 03:56:42.254]  But you're getting people attacking me, are attacking me with such a level of hate, such a level of intensity of feeling, you know,
[03:56:43.664 --> 03:56:57.657]  Scandalogical and other abusive references, you know, to me and to my family, because we, you know, I don't know why, because I guess I dared to say this had changed.
[03:56:57.657 --> 03:56:58.658]  It was all a psyop.
[03:56:58.658 --> 03:57:05.405]  And I guess QAnon, not being smart enough to figure it out, decided to prove it was a psyop.
[03:57:05.405 --> 03:57:06.566]  If this is the quality
[03:57:07.495 --> 03:57:07.875]  I don't know.
[03:57:27.532 --> 03:57:34.858]  You know Q is basically misguided here philosophically.
[03:57:34.858 --> 03:57:42.824]  I don't know if he really understands the implications of saying that patriots are selfless.
[03:57:43.264 --> 03:57:49.606]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[03:58:50.278 --> 03:58:51.139]  It'd take hours.
[03:58:51.139 --> 03:58:53.581]  Michael's VX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:58:53.581 --> 03:58:54.762]  It's stronger.
[03:58:54.762 --> 03:58:56.384]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:58:56.384 --> 03:58:59.607]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.

[03:59:07.794 --> 03:59:07.874]  It's
[03:59:26.448 --> 03:59:28.209]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
